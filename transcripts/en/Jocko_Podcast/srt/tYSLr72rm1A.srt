00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:06,250
This is Jocko podcast number
92 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,640
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,860
The concept of finding an
IED is relatively simple.

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,070
It is essentially identifying what doesn't
belong in the natural area in front

5
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:28,200
of you before one proceeds. However,

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,360
one must ensure that all of the marines
with them or at a safe distance such

7
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,280
that if the searcher unintentionally
detonate an IED during his investigation,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,060
the marines he is with will not be harmed.

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,870
The first step is to take a good look
at where you are and where are you

10
00:00:47,871 --> 00:00:52,720
planning to go identify anything
that looks out of the ordinary.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,280
With respect to nature,

12
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:00,230
the world naturally doesn't often
have patterns or perfect shapes.

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,320
Essentially you are looking for areas
where you suspect man has been in contact

14
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:10,630
with nature.
When one patrols in the same area,

15
00:01:10,631 --> 00:01:15,631
frequently one can establish a baseline
observation for what to look for and

16
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:18,250
what the area looks like normally.

17
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,500
Thus on subsequent visits,

18
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:27,030
it is possible to identify
elements that are out of place.

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,270
The next step is to investigate the
route that you have chosen through this

20
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:34,104
danger area.

21
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,020
The three main tools used for this
investigation are the eyeballs,

22
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
a metal detector and to cutting edge
digging device called the human hand

23
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,080
proceeding slowly in a forward direction.

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,370
One swings the metal detector in a fashion
that covers every square inch of the

25
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:59,400
chosen route.
In order to do this,

26
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,820
start with a metal detector
to one side of the route.

27
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,380
Okay

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,360
and move it straight
across to the other side,

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,720
keeping the search head an inch or
two above and parallel to the ground.

30
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,550
Once it is a cross,

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,290
move the detector forward half the length
of the search head and swing it in the

32
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:23,890
opposite direction to the
original side of the route.

33
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,740
This is a process that continues for
the entirety of your time moving through

34
00:02:30,741 --> 00:02:31,640
the danger area.

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,570
At some point during your
movement along this route,

36
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,750
you will want to investigate certain
spots that you think may contain an IED.

37
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,790
You can be alerted to these spots in
multiple ways from your early assessment

38
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,830
before proceeding through the area,

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,320
newly acquired suspicions as you move
through the area and also from sounds that

40
00:02:58,321 --> 00:02:59,680
your metal detector makes

41
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,660
the process of swinging the metal detector
back and forth and inching forward is

42
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:06,650
time consuming.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,750
The best of the best are the ones that
can optimize safety and keep time spent

44
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:17,130
to a minimum. It is
always better. However,

45
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,750
to err on the side of caution,
except in the most extreme of emergencies,

46
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,580
the investigation of a suspicious area
must proceed with extreme caution.

47
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,370
You start by kneeling down,

48
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,340
being sure to be well balanced and stable.

49
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,970
You must ensure that no gear is going
to accidentally fall off or slip out and

50
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,180
touch the ground.

51
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:52,150
You reach out with your fingers and with
the gentleness of a butterfly landing

52
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:54,620
on a daisy,

53
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,240
move the dirt in front of the
front edge of the metal hit.

54
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,340
Proceed forward a nanometer
at a time in this fashion,

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,520
uncovering more dirt over a wider space
until you either find the metal that set

56
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:17,011
off the detector or you are satisfied
that there is no danger from this

57
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:21,980
particular metal hit.
If metal is found,

58
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,480
the area must be rechecked to ensure
that the metal was found was not a decoy.

59
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,310
One may think that the tension during
this time is akin to being Tom cruise

60
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:36,700
dangling inches above
a motion sensor floor,

61
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,020
but the necessity of having a clear
mind and the amount of practice that has

62
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:46,700
gone into this exact process makes
it seem second nature and ordinary.

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,790
After you are satisfied that you
have cleared this suspicious area,

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,540
proceed forward
as you move forward.

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,580
You are also proofing the lane.

66
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,590
That thing proofing the lane or confirming
that is free from IED is usually done

67
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:10,390
with a special mechanical device

68
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,980
but it is now being done with your feet

69
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,190
and don't forget as you go forward to
lay down markers for everyone else who

70
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,690
comes behind you to follow.

71
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,710
This is the way that I handled
the situation I was now in.

72
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:35,080
I inched forward with my metal detector.

73
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,930
I didn't see anything
special about the area.

74
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,910
My metal detector was making noises,

75
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,750
but nothing large enough that I thought
at warranty did an investigation.

76
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,550
The marines in our patrol
watched and waited.

77
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,340
As I cleared and proofed the lane,

78
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,150
then it all went black.

79
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,383
No,

80
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,550
that description

81
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,180
is about as good as I have read about
the act of searching for IED. Yes.

82
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
I actually never searched for
IED in that type of method.

83
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,950
And of course in Ramadi everyone
was always searching Fridays you,

84
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,150
you were always looking,
you inspecting.

85
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,130
We were suspicious of
every pile of rubble,

86
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,650
every piece of junk on the road,

87
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:50,651
every off colored piece of dirt
or pavement or concrete or sand.

88
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,650
But we were in the city

89
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,180
and there was pedestrian
traffic and most of the eds,

90
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,580
we're targeting vehicles,
not foot patrols,

91
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,810
but whether
in a vehicle or on foot.

92
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:21,130
The IUD for the most part has been the
biggest threat and the biggest cause of

93
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:25,850
casualties in our recent wars.

94
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,450
And for the enemy,
it's a low risk,

95
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
high reward weapon.

96
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,260
And for us it's an evil weapon.

97
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,870
It's a cowardly weapon and
it is an effective weapon.

98
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,790
It's a weapon that plants
itself in your mind

99
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,653
always there.

100
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,803
Yeah.

101
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,273
Waiting

102
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,020
around that corner under that curb
on the other side of that sidewalk,

103
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,723
it's waiting.

104
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,003
Now

105
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:29,630
there are those whose job it is
to actually interdict that weapon,

106
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,210
the,
the IED.

107
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:41,410
It is their job to face that fear up
close and personal day in and day out.

108
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,930
You've got EOD explosive ordinance
disposal is one group that does it.

109
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Complete professionals and
the EOD technicians that I
deployed with in the seal

110
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,840
teams were just outstanding
in everything that they did,

111
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:07,800
which by the way was not
only find in disarm IED,

112
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,600
they also did everything that we did.

113
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,960
They'd cleared rooms and patrol through
the streets and maneuvered in firefights

114
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,090
just as the seals did.
They were awesome.

115
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,120
And in addition to EOD

116
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:26,060
combat engineers in the army and the
Marine Corps also do mine clearance.

117
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,790
And of course I talk about
combat engineers a lot.

118
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:33,930
Okay.

119
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,930
Because of the incredible role that they
played in the battle of Ramadi and the

120
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:44,721
combat engineers were outstanding in
their standard job of building combat

121
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:48,350
outposts.
And building and maintaining the,

122
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,270
the infrastructure of the bases.
And they were,

123
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:55,920
they were awesome in that
performance under fire.

124
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,670
But at some point

125
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,470
the combat engineers job morphed into
mine clearance and it's because I would

126
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:13,170
suspect, you know, they
work with demolitions. So,

127
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:17,760
so combat engineers do
breaches two doors into walls,

128
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,950
they build bridges,

129
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,720
roads and bridges and they also clear
obstacles from roads and bridges.

130
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,200
And so eventually at some point this
morphed into combat engineers doing IED

131
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:37,530
clearance both on roads and
then out on foot patrols.

132
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,233
Now

133
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,900
there's jobs in the world
that I wouldn't want to do

134
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,880
and this is one of them.
It takes a massive amount of patients.

135
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:56,260
Yeah.

136
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,250
It takes an incredible amount of skill
and it takes an incredible ability to

137
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:01,750
overcome fear to,

138
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:06,810
if you're going to actually
seek out and touch the thing,

139
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,180
the very thing that is trying
to kill you in order to stop it.

140
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,260
Yeah,

141
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,260
that's a job that I didn't
want then and I don't want now.

142
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,170
And I am thankful that there was others
that stepped up and did that job.

143
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,850
And I'm honored to have
on the podcasts tonight,

144
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,850
one of those
brave men,

145
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,570
a Marine Corps combat engineered who
served in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

146
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,340
And the guy by the way,

147
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,910
who wrote that opening description of
what it was like to go out and hunt

148
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,350
for ids.
Guy By the name of Mr Rob Jones.

149
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,940
Rob, welcome to the show. This is an,

150
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,550
this is an honor for me to be,
I just really appreciate,

151
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,880
appreciate you giving me the opportunity
to, to come on the show. All man,

152
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,390
trust me, the honors all, all
ours off a thousand percent.

153
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,640
You can't even argue with that
point. We won't let it happen. Uh,

154
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,610
give us just before we jump
into your Marine Corps career,

155
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,940
just give us a little pre marine corps
background on growing up and what that,

156
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:29,080
where that was and what it was like.

157
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,070
Can I answer your question about how it
combat engineers came to find it yet?

158
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,960
Please do.
So when you go to combat engineer school,

159
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,070
one of the things they teach you is
minefield and placement and defeat.

160
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,720
You do that, you use mine
detectors and metal detectors.

161
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:48,790
So I think that's the main reason that it,
uh,

162
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,530
I wonder at what point you think that
came from World War II? I don't know.

163
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,830
That's a good question because,
yeah, when I said it morphed into,

164
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:58,240
I was thinking like back,

165
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,580
it must have been sometime in World War
II where they said, okay, we're, we're,

166
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:05,620
we're gonna get over this river.
Okay.

167
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,010
So common engineer's going to get over
the river. Uh, we're going to, um,

168
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,990
secure this compound.
Okay.

169
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,540
We're going to secure the
compound or we're going to
rebuild this compound. Okay.

170
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,570
Well at some point they said, you know
what, what if there's mines there? Okay,

171
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:17,810
well we've got to get them cleared out.
Yeah.

172
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,520
So at some point they realize that you
can't build if you can't clear it, right?

173
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:25,270
Yeah. And you can't move if you
can't clear. So he's got to do it.

174
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,640
Somebody's got to do it.
And,

175
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,120
and they weren't able to slough
off that job on to somebody else,

176
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,920
which is what I,
what I would have been trying to do,

177
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,420
which is what I would have been
absolutely been trying to do. Like, Hey,

178
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:42,190
can we get somebody else to do that
jump? Uh, yeah. So that's good. So,

179
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:45,610
so how'd you end up with a Marine
Corps? Oh yeah. My background,

180
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:50,440
I grew up in on a farm. Uh, nothing
really special about my upbringing.

181
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,470
The side cut a farm that was a horse farm.
Um,

182
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,780
I hated horses because I have to pick
up this. What is, what do you do?

183
00:13:58,781 --> 00:14:02,620
What is the purpose of our horse farm?
The farm that I grew up on,

184
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:07,650
the purpose of it was my parents would
take people on horseback riding trips,

185
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,410
pay them money, and they take him out
for a couple hours in the forest. Got It.

186
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,580
Got It. And so it was my duty
to clean up after the horses,

187
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:21,490
feed the horses, stack their hay bales
in the summertime, get them their water.

188
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,820
So I didn't really enjoy the horses
as much as most people would.

189
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,920
But uh,
you know,

190
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm thankful that I had that experience
because I think it did instill in me a

191
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:33,640
work ethic that doesn't debt a
lot of people don't get. Yeah.

192
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,460
I think when you come from,

193
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,910
cause you know a lot of guys when they
come in the military that they've never

194
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:40,840
worked hard before.

195
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,880
But the guys I've met in the military
that came from some kind of a farming

196
00:14:45,881 --> 00:14:49,660
background, they're like,
Hey, I'm so happy here.

197
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,860
I'm up at three in the morning,

198
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,950
you know,
milking cows or whatever,

199
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,250
or cleaning up horse shit.
In your case.

200
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,580
The number of times I had to wheel this
wheel barrel full of manure up a offense

201
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:07,310
board onto this big

202
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,500
pile. And the were times I fell off
that thing every time like this,

203
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,440
curse those horses,
I hated them so much.

204
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:18,340
Now I like horses fine that I don't
have gotten over. You're a horse PTSD

205
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,230
and so what you, you, you graduated
from high school and then you,

206
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,350
you went to college, right?
Yeah, I went to Virginia Tech.

207
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,330
Uh, I was actually a
computer science major. Um,

208
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:35,740
I'm already suspect. I'm
impressed. That goes impressed.

209
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,633
I'm suspect

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,080
point during that, uh, during my
college career, my sophomore year,

211
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,530
I decided that computer
science was not for me.

212
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,950
And how have you feel?
Betrayed.

213
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,170
And I decided,

214
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:53,940
I dunno,

215
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,470
I felt like I had spent the first 20
years of my life kind of looking after

216
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:03,471
myself and now I needed to do something
that was beyond my own self interest.

217
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,320
And a buddy of mine had just
joined the Marine Corps.

218
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,070
So I read a couple books about the Marine
Corps Brotherhood of heroes about the

219
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:17,700
battle, the Palae Lu and I said, Yep,

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,130
that's what I want to do.
I want to join the Marine Corps.

221
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,550
So before telling my parents
before telling anybody

222
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,810
looked up where the recruiter was,
went down there, he wasn't there,

223
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,730
marine corps recruiter wasn't there.

224
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,960
Air Force recruiter tells me to come in
his office and tells me about the air

225
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:35,570
force and I said he had just
told me when the Marine Corp,

226
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,203
yeah,

227
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,860
nothing against the air force.

228
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:43,861
But I had already decided on
marine corps and so I joined up

229
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,970
I, this may be right or wrong,
I'm pretty sure it's right.

230
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,030
The Marine Corps has the like the lowest
a recruiting budget and they have the

231
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:56,340
highest recruiting numbers
because it's the Marine Corps

232
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,790
there. Their approach, I guess it was
like, Oh, you want to be one of us, right?

233
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,650
Maybe. Yeah. See if you can.
Good luck. I do. Yeah. Um,

234
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,440
so I joined up as a reservist,

235
00:17:09,441 --> 00:17:11,840
my original plan because I
was after my junior year,

236
00:17:11,841 --> 00:17:13,370
so I wanted to finish college at least.

237
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:19,360
So my original plan was I did the 92 day
reservists program where I went to boot

238
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:23,960
camp after my junior year.
And then I finished my last year of uh,

239
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,650
college and then I went
to job school and MCT.

240
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,680
How did your academic performance change
or did it between pre boot camp and

241
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:34,544
post boot camp?

242
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,250
It didn't a whole lot because I think I
kind of checked out a college after my

243
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,410
junior year. I was like, I
just want to go deploy it,

244
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:47,840
but I just kind of want to get this
degree done just so I have it. Um,

245
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,870
now after I deployed a few a couple
times and had a little bit more life

246
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,160
experience would probably
be a lot different.

247
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,300
But just those three months at
bootcamp didn't really change my,

248
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:01,860
your academic academic
approach. I was funny. Smart.

249
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:06,060
I was smart enough, I just didn't
care that much about it anymore. Um,

250
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,270
so my, my original plan was
to do that and then have the,

251
00:18:10,271 --> 00:18:11,740
a little bit of experience as an,
uh,

252
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,330
an enlisted guy and then you use
my degree to become an officer.

253
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,610
But when I was in engineer school
after that, that second summer,

254
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,220
my company, my reserve company said we're
sending a volunteer platoon to Iraq.

255
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,100
So I said, well, that's the whole reason
I joined up was to go fight the war.

256
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:35,040
So screw being an officer,
I'm going to deploy.

257
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,950
And so then we go to my first appointment.

258
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,570
So, um, I thought it was pretty,
you got a good note in here about,

259
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,350
uh, about the Marine Corps and I'm just
going to, I'm just going to read this.

260
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:50,170
I'm taking this stuff from your,
your journal that you have online,

261
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:54,580
which is awesome reed. So here
we go. Back to the journal.

262
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,650
The Marine Corps began to shape me long
before I ever have ever arrived at boot

263
00:18:59,651 --> 00:19:02,500
camp in Parris Island,
South Carolina, Carolina.

264
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,490
It started when I read the
book Brotherhood of Heroes,

265
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,820
the tail of the battle of
how Lou in World War II.

266
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,550
It was through the stories of the of the
Marines told and those pages that I was

267
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:18,010
introduced to, the
courage, Spirit, tenacity,

268
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,390
altruism and brotherhood
that the marines possess,

269
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,920
qualities that I would soon
be ingrained with as well.

270
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,750
The basics of these qualities were
taught to me and my fellow recruits in

271
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,770
bootcamp through rudimentary but
effective means the proverbial stick.

272
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:43,000
It was through punishment that we
were shown what it meant to possess.

273
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:47,650
The attributes of a marine punishment
would come in a variety of modes based on

274
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:52,450
the same comp concept, countless
pushups, sit ups, sprinting,

275
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,030
caring,
and of course screaming.

276
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,180
The drill instructors
would use any excuse,

277
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,650
not that they needed one to inflict
pain upon us, not being loud enough,

278
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,830
looking in the wrong place in perfection,
in uniform,

279
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,480
dirty squad bay and not moving fast enough
for their inspections to name a few.

280
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,920
The reality of the situation was
that we were never loud enough,

281
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,850
always looking in the wrong place,
never had perfect uniforms.

282
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,990
The squad bay was always too
dirty and we were simply too slow.

283
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,120
The idea wasn't simply to
pointlessly inflict pain,

284
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,390
but to teach lessons using
the pain as the instructor.

285
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,570
It was to force us to
make ourselves better,

286
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,720
so the whole platoon as
a whole would be better.

287
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,200
Yeah.

288
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,640
The idea was to form a brotherhood
through shared suffering and shared

289
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,840
dependence.

290
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,010
It was to teach us to
keep fighting pain so that

291
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,290
the platoon as a whole
could stop being punished.

292
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,920
The point was that once
we reached perfection,

293
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,700
the requirements changed so that we
were forced to constantly reach for it,

294
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,270
thus forcing us to become better
than we ever knew we could be.

295
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,450
This is how the Marine Corps takes hunks
of iron and turns them into juvenile

296
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:08,284
steel.

297
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,710
That's why the Marine Corps doesn't
need a lot of recruiting money,

298
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,270
but so true, and I liked that.
I liked what you pointed out,

299
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,540
the shared dependence and how when you're
going through bootcamp scenarios and

300
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,700
training scenarios that are really hard,

301
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:33,340
you realize that you're not going to be
able to do this alone and you're going

302
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:37,800
to have to rely on these other guys who
you may not in the civilian world you

303
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:42,801
wouldn't have even been associated with
and now you're not only associated with

304
00:21:44,101 --> 00:21:48,810
them, you depend on them for, for
your survival and to get through it.

305
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,090
And that's,
I think that's what makes,

306
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,680
that's what makes that
military experience.

307
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,110
And certainly the Marine Corps
does an outstanding job of it.

308
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,350
They think of formulating that bond
that is is unique to the military.

309
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,920
Yeah, that's what, that's the thing
that makes marines what they are and,

310
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,580
and brings out the best in people's
when they're doing something,

311
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:18,170
not for their own self interest,
but for somebody else.

312
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,180
And I would volunteer for the worst
stuff so that I could prevent my buddies

313
00:22:25,161 --> 00:22:29,300
from having to do it.
Like walking through the Euphrates river,

314
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,010
looking for whatever,
trying to find weapons caches in Iraq,

315
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,590
and then getting back
at the end of the day,

316
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:40,910
just totally soaked and covered
in trash water, you know,

317
00:22:40,911 --> 00:22:44,000
and they come in and say, we're doing it
again. Who wants to go and be like, yeah,

318
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:48,050
I'll go, I'll go again. You know? And
that's, I think that's why I really,

319
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,120
I kind of enjoyed the combat engineer
role too because I'm going out there

320
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,270
protecting people, protecting my
buddies, protecting other marines,

321
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:04,690
and taking the risk on me.
And I mean,

322
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,340
that's what being a marine is all about.
Anybody else would've done it too.

323
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,390
Yeah. And so you go your
first deployment to Iraq and,

324
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,650
um, what was that deployment
like? Where'd you go? Uh,

325
00:23:16,651 --> 00:23:17,820
how Binya over?

326
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,160
So this is 2008 to 2000 names
are pretty mellow at 2008. Yeah.

327
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,780
UH, Iraqi kind of slowed down at
that point wasn't much going on.

328
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,450
We had one

329
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:37,250
tiny little incident where we were on
a convoy and some guy knows were fired,

330
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:42,210
maybe three Ak rounds and then ran
away. And it was still, you know,

331
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,310
nothing and that, but that was in like
the first couple of weeks. It's like,

332
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,390
what was your response to the
three rounds from an AK 47?

333
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,140
I continued sitting in the back
of the seven ton, dude, a dude,

334
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,620
like an 18 year old,
uh,

335
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,580
lance corporal unload with
700 rounds of 50 cal or

336
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:04,570
no, it was a long convoy. So it was
way up there and I was like, oh,

337
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:08,220
I got to get out. I gotta get up
there. But it was, it was over.

338
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,920
Did they shoot back?
Did they returned fire at him?

339
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,600
No, I don't think so. I mean, he, like,

340
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:18,160
he did one of those things where he
raised over and then left by the time

341
00:24:18,161 --> 00:24:22,780
anybody who was able to figure out
where he was and it's gone. So that was,

342
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:25,870
but that was in the first couple of weeks,
so it was kind of off to a good start.

343
00:24:25,871 --> 00:24:28,960
And then, uh, oh, nothing
else happened really.

344
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,300
So what were you guys doing
during that deployment?

345
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,150
I guess it was kind of the,
uh,

346
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,150
the build portion of, uh, of the strategy
at that point. You know, we were,

347
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:46,000
we were helping the local population
build up their cities build.

348
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:50,350
We were helping to build a,
uh, Iraqi police stations.

349
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:51,820
And,

350
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,820
but what I spent most of my time doing
was when we would go out and find buried

351
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:57,881
weapons caches,

352
00:24:57,881 --> 00:25:02,881
so just these old stores of Rpgs and
stuff that the al Qaeda used to be using,

353
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,980
but they had just left there.
And then,

354
00:25:08,981 --> 00:25:12,220
so the local population would sort of,
somebody would give us a tip, right?

355
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,720
And we would go out to this
big field and they'd say, yeah,

356
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,590
it's supposedly somewhere in
here. There's a, a weapons cache.

357
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,090
So we take out a metal detectors and
sweep every square inch of that field or

358
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:28,240
hill or wherever we were,
tree tree line.

359
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,010
And until we either does certain,
determined there was nothing,

360
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:36,690
or we would find it and we dig it up and
stack it, and then EOD would come and

361
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,040
blow it up. And were
you attached to a, uh,

362
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,670
like an a combat engineer platoon for
or where you're attached to an infantry

363
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:43,200
platoon?

364
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,790
Yeah. So the way it works for the,
what we call division side engineers,

365
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:51,791
like combat engineer battalion is one
combat engineer platoon is attached to an

366
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:56,270
infantry battalion.
And then you kind of break it down.

367
00:25:56,271 --> 00:26:01,271
So one squad of that platoon goes with
each company and then one team goes with

368
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,644
the platoon.

369
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:08,120
So you kind of help that put tune out
a just pretty much attached to them.

370
00:26:08,121 --> 00:26:08,660
The entire,

371
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,280
so when you guys would be doing these
clearances of like, let's say a big field,

372
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:16,660
it would be a platoon,
a Marine Corps platoon,

373
00:26:16,661 --> 00:26:18,760
and you would be doing all,
all the sweeping.

374
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,460
Yeah. So it'd be a Marine
Corps platoon or squad.

375
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,410
He used to be a squad Lod would,
uh,

376
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,570
we'd go out on a squad
patrol troll out there.

377
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,570
They would set up security on the
area and they would just wait.

378
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:35,850
And then you'd be me and one other guy
and we would sweep and sometimes we would

379
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:39,270
have one of the infantry
guys have a e tool.

380
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,290
And be like Dick there
and then he would dig and

381
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,130
nothing. And then would
you, when you'd find

382
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,760
caches, would you guys blow them
in place or would you recover it?

383
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,830
I guess it would depend.

384
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,570
We would take pictures of what we found
so we could write the report when we got

385
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:58,040
back and if it was out in the middle of
nowhere, a lot of the times they would,

386
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,130
they'll blow it in place. We have to
wait for EOD. They wouldn't let us do it.

387
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,170
That's actually really jacked up.
I it's so stupid. It's so jack.

388
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,260
Cause there was only one EOD unit for
EOD guys for the entire battalion.

389
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,220
And not to mention that's the
fun part. That quickly. Right.

390
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,953
I know how to,

391
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,820
they used to back in like
2005 combat engineers were
doing all that all the time.

392
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,580
He just lay it out and
you just sympathetically
designated with the sticker.

393
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,920
That's all it is. It's because the
war slowed down. Yeah. Slows down.

394
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:35,100
All of a sudden people start putting the
rules and regulations in weight and we

395
00:27:35,101 --> 00:27:36,030
could have Eud do that.

396
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,550
No one has that same thing.

397
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:41,450
We had the heaviest,
I've,

398
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,320
I'm sure when you guys were in Ramadi,
you just had the standard flak vest.

399
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,540
We had this ridiculous turtle shell,

400
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,770
Front sappies back, sappy
side, sappies neck protector,

401
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:59,470
groin protector, everything but
protector. Like it was just the,

402
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,610
the vest itself was 70 pounds.

403
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,720
Let me tell you something interesting
about that. When we were in Ramadi,

404
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,620
not everyone had that and
everyone wanted it and okay.

405
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,260
They did their best. I remember
actually, uh, the kernel,

406
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:17,770
the brigade coming down and bringing side
Sapi plates down to combat outpost to

407
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:20,320
hand them out to guys because
everybody wanted them.

408
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,010
They wanted the neck protectors, the
shoulder protectors, the groin protectors.

409
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:29,080
They wanted everything. I mean, most I'll
have many guys just, hey, you, you know,

410
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,550
especially if you're sitting in a
turret or, yeah, like load me up.

411
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:38,410
I want all that, the neck. And they
wanted it all because it was gnarly.

412
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,750
Yeah. And then go try and
do a hit on a house with it.

413
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,980
Yeah, no, that, that part's not fun. But,

414
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,670
uh,

415
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,830
but so it's probably that same thing
where they're just coming up with all the

416
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:52,160
safety rules and you have
to have your helmet, gloves,

417
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,530
eye protection on at all times
when you're outside the wire.

418
00:28:54,531 --> 00:28:57,440
So for whatever reason,
they didn't let us blow it up.

419
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:02,240
So we'd have to wait for EOD to come out
and then they would either blow it up

420
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,820
there if it was out in the middle of
nowhere. But if it was in the city,

421
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:07,010
they would usually take it somewhere.

422
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,840
And meanwhile the rest of
the combat engineer battalion
are out helping with the

423
00:29:13,721 --> 00:29:15,480
building, the structures,
building schools,

424
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,140
helping the infrastructure
and stuff like that.

425
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,450
It would depend, I mean, yeah.

426
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:23,451
So whatever that platoon that
they were attached to was doing,

427
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:24,540
they'd just be doing that.

428
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:28,590
And then every now and then if they
needed all of us back to build up an Iraqi

429
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:31,620
police station,
they would call everybody in or everybody.

430
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:34,500
But a couple of guys in and then we'd
all go out as a platoon to build that.

431
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,100
Got It. But I spent most of
my time just doing the cash,

432
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:39,180
sweeping and going on patrol.

433
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,430
So within the platoon or certain people as

434
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,590
like mine sweepers or does
everyone get trained in that?

435
00:29:46,591 --> 00:29:49,960
Everybody should be able to do it.
Got It. How come you kept getting the,

436
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,450
cause you've volunteered for that. You
said, hey, I'll go find these. Yeah.

437
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,840
And my fire team was more,

438
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,380
my squad was kind of,

439
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,920
we didn't want to do the construction
and stuff cause we thought it was boring.

440
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,760
I wasn't great at can I can
swing a hammer, but you know,

441
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,670
I wasn't like good at it.
Um,

442
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,440
and so we kind of tried to put ourselves
in positions where we wouldn't have to

443
00:30:15,441 --> 00:30:19,520
go do that stuff. We tried to always
be out with the, with the squads,

444
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:24,380
with the platoons as often as we could
so we could avoid the construction stuff.

445
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,420
But then yeah, that's what I
wanted it to be doing. Yeah.

446
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:30,810
Yeah. Be Out on patrol. Yeah,
exactly. So then that deployment,

447
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:34,380
you come home and you had
already graduated from
college at this point, right?

448
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,560
Yeah. And so you come home and then
what happens when you get home?

449
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,870
So what's your plan when you get home?

450
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,870
When I get home, well, so we
were in Iraq and my buddy, uh,

451
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,340
Ronnie and Daniel,
we were all drinking and we were like,

452
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,290
that was not what we wanted.

453
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,350
You know what the good thing
is when you're drinking,

454
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,890
that's when you make your best military
decisions about what to do with your

455
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:57,724
career.
But yeah.

456
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,320
Well you were just sitting there.
Go ahead.

457
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:03,010
That was not what we
were hoping it would be.

458
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,260
Um, we wanted to do some
fighting, do some killing.

459
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,030
Um, so we were like, we got to figure
out a way to go to Afghanistan.

460
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,680
And so we started trying to look
up cause we were in the reserve.

461
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,180
So sometimes there's,

462
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:25,060
there's programs where you can be an
augmentee, an individual. Augmentee

463
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,390
did you have a civilian job at this point?

464
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,250
I didn't cause I just graduated college.
Just graduated college.

465
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,510
Then you go on deployment, then you'd come
home and now you're saying, all right,

466
00:31:33,511 --> 00:31:36,120
what do, how do I get back?
How do I, how do I go fight?

467
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,780
I had 25,000 bucks from deployment, so
I bought a motorcycle, you know. Yup.

468
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,940
That's good investment.
Good longterm investment crashes.

469
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,040
But yeah,
so I was looking at,

470
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,320
I was looking for a
job to tide me over and

471
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,920
trying everything I could
to go to Afghanistan.

472
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,120
But luckily it was pretty
shortly after we got back,

473
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:04,630
we go to drill and company says sitting
volunteer platoon to Afghanistan and

474
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:09,020
boom right here. Cause Afghanistan
was heating up at this time,

475
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,760
if you remember.
But,

476
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,930
but we had still had to wait about eight
or nine months before we went to the

477
00:32:17,361 --> 00:32:21,350
workup for that. So I just took a
job putting out traffic counters,

478
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,860
like there's a little to go across the
road and you attached a little electronic

479
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:26,460
box to it.
So I just took a job doing that.

480
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,980
That's sorta like related to IED,
isn't that a little bit of,

481
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:34,520
it's on the side of the road, you know,
fresh water fish wire on the road. That,

482
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:38,240
and it just got in shape and partied.
Now did you,

483
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,190
did you do more drill once

484
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,220
you're, uh, getting ready to deploy?

485
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,270
Uh, yeah. Well, uh, so when I say drill
I guess I should explain that's the,

486
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,200
the deal, uh, for reservists, do you go in

487
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,610
when weekend? One weekend. A month. So
your drill, that's called the drill. Yeah.

488
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,660
Did they escalate that at all
when you're going to deploy?

489
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,190
Yeah.
So they kind of,

490
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,110
they kind of cater the drills
that you do based on what,

491
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:06,180
what you got to need upcoming.

492
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:11,181
So I do recall we did a couple
where we would do go a go do a,

493
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,390
like an IED training, uh, section.

494
00:33:18,391 --> 00:33:22,800
And then we would, since I had
experience now we would just take,

495
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,380
whenever we were at a drill,
we would just start training the other,

496
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:29,820
the new guys that were going to
be going with us on machine guns,

497
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,550
metal detectors, and just try
getting them trained up. But yeah.

498
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:39,540
And so a lot of the training was kind
of on our own because you only get that

499
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,240
one weekend a month and they only have
so much money and they have to train the

500
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:45,530
whole company as opposed to just
the platoon that's going. Right.

501
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,090
So, so then do they activate you? How
far before deployment do they activate?

502
00:33:51,091 --> 00:33:54,000
You see,
you can do some legitimate real training.

503
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,090
We,
so we did that.

504
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,290
We actually managed to get a month
at Camp Lejune at courthouse bay,

505
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:02,780
which is the combat engineer a school.

506
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:08,270
And so we did manage to
get a month long school of,

507
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:13,010
you know, just doing
demolition, a refreshment,

508
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,240
uh, more IED stuff,
patrol practice, you know,

509
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,920
just doing all sorts
of training like that.

510
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,900
And then your workup is pretty much
just however long it takes to do Mojave

511
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:27,470
Viper with your battalion and
then maybe a month before that.

512
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:28,911
Yeah.
So,

513
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:33,890
so maybe three months total
before you're going on for three,

514
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:38,570
four months. Got It. And were you,
uh, with the rest of the guys?

515
00:34:38,571 --> 00:34:41,170
So it's one platoon that's
going one platoon, one puts,

516
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,450
it wasn't even a full Patina.
There's three squads. Okay.

517
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,140
So how many guys that total?

518
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:50,610
It was actually even short squads too.
So it was a, let me think each other.

519
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,320
There was a fire to nine, 10, 11 per squad

520
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,380
and then three for the,
the brass

521
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,250
platoon. So back then you go,

522
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:07,251
you do your desert drill and everyone's
unified in the new d leave before that,

523
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:09,540
and then, then you, and
then you go on deployment.

524
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,630
Yeah. So they give you
a little bit of a, yeah,

525
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,550
they give you a little bit
of leaf before you, uh,

526
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,840
have to go over and it's like four or five
days. So everybody flies home and then

527
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:24,470
got it comes back. So now you
show up in Afghanistan and what's,

528
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,820
how's that different from Iraq?

529
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,580
You know what, the first portion
of it was not that different. Um,

530
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,980
the terrain was a lot different.
So where'd, where'd you first

531
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,370
go?

532
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,200
So, uh, in Afghanistan we
were at, we started, I was,

533
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,990
I deployed with three, seven as
an attachment, third battalion,

534
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:50,340
seventh Marine Corps regimen.
And we were in Dell Rom,

535
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,100
which I, I'm pretty sure
it was in Helmand province.

536
00:35:53,101 --> 00:35:56,100
It was kind of right on the border,
so I don't recall exactly, but,

537
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,240
and pretty much kilo company was the
company that my squad was attached to and

538
00:36:02,521 --> 00:36:07,380
they got sent out just in the
middle of nowhere to a file.

539
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,290
And then they had a patrol
base that was even smaller.

540
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:13,320
You didn't even further
out that I got sent to,

541
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:18,030
I was a team leader and so usually you
would have one team in the one spot in

542
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:22,140
one team in the other spot.
But since we were kind of short on guys,

543
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,340
it was pretty much,
I was the only engineer for that platoon.

544
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,340
And yeah, so we were
in, in Dell Rom and so,

545
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,420
and how Binya was urban, everything
was able walking through a city,

546
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:40,390
everything was urban, but
Afghanistan was just barren. Yeah.

547
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,140
And what, when you got out to
this Ford base, what would you do?

548
00:36:44,141 --> 00:36:45,490
What were you guys doing out there?
What was the,

549
00:36:45,491 --> 00:36:47,590
what was the infantry thing that you
were attached to you doing out there?

550
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,770
Uh, patrolling. So it was kind of similar.

551
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:53,260
That's why I say it wasn't a whole lot
different from Iraq because we were

552
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:58,930
basically just interacting with the local
populace, uh, find out what they needed,

553
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:01,570
providing security for that area.
Like they had a bizarre,

554
00:37:01,571 --> 00:37:05,110
that would come every weekend. So we'd
go out, provide security for that.

555
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:10,710
And so I was still using my metal
detector to clear danger areas if we can.

556
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,710
There's a lot of Wattis out there,
so we'd have to funnel through the Wadi.

557
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,260
So I checked that.
Um,

558
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,470
how often were you where you
find in Ids and that information?

559
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,470
I didn't find a one on there now. There
was, it was a pretty pacified area.

560
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:30,090
I think we had one firefight that one
of the squads got into and that's it.

561
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,540
Um,

562
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,270
so, so your first part of the
deployment and how long was that?

563
00:37:34,271 --> 00:37:35,770
How long was that part of the deployment?

564
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:38,100
That was two and a half,
three months I think.

565
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,140
So there's kind of like a little tuneup,
right.

566
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:45,410
And then we pass that area off to the
Georgian army and that's when we moved to

567
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,980
Sangin to,
to take over from the Brits

568
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,970
and now saying in Zen,
like that's the Hellman province central.

569
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:57,580
Right. I mean that's, that's, that's it.

570
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,290
Yeah. That's Taliban central
down there. Uh, yeah.

571
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,680
And as soon as you get
on the ground there,

572
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:04,940
did you feel it when
you got on the ground?

573
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,990
We knew. Yeah. I mean

574
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,930
we kind of did a push into that area
before we actually moved out there and we

575
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:17,490
knew shit was getting real when we,

576
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:18,720
uh,
they just,

577
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,560
they're like pack up a pack and we got
on the helicopter and they just flew us

578
00:38:24,751 --> 00:38:28,020
out and just dropped us off in
the middle of absolutely nowhere.

579
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,170
And we just started walking it,

580
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:35,860
just leave your packs here and
start walking that way and just,

581
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,860
just basically just taking
territory from the Taliban.

582
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,170
Now did you,
do guys do a thorough turnover with them

583
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,090
Brits? I wasn't a part of that, but

584
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,500
not really.
I mean we,

585
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:53,080
we pretty much came into Fabi
Anchorman and we're there for a day,

586
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:56,040
day and a half. And then
the Brits were gone. No, no.

587
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,730
Oh, we left. And then, yeah,
you pushed out. So the Brits
were there when you were,

588
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:01,920
when you were there on the ground.
We were both there at the same time.

589
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,000
Probably the headquarters elements. We're
doing a turnover. Yeah. They were like,

590
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:07,040
hey,
we're getting our boys out,

591
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,610
pushing immediately.

592
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:13,700
And we had a couple world marines with
us and it's in British army or this,

593
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:18,360
I think they had a small or
maybe a toe that we didn't have.

594
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,200
So like units that we,
we needed from them,

595
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:25,470
they would send out with us and
they were great. Um, but uh,

596
00:39:25,471 --> 00:39:28,680
from what I understood, they just didn't
have the manpower to really do much

597
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,330
where they, the guys that
were with you, were you,

598
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,450
were they giving you any turnover items?
Like, Hey, you need to look out for this.

599
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,520
Hey, this is what's going
on here. No. Were you doing

600
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,870
receive any cause I don't think they
really went out much so I don't,

601
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:45,340
not really sure how much they really
could have told us about what was outside

602
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:49,090
of the patrol basis.
And I never,

603
00:39:49,091 --> 00:39:53,320
I don't even remember. I think we may
have talked to their combat engineers,

604
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:56,140
we've got some demo from them like hey
can we have some deck decourt and they

605
00:39:56,141 --> 00:39:58,210
gave it to us and that's about it.
Yeah.

606
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,540
And that's cause they were
just completely undermanned.

607
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:02,150
Yeah. The, from what I understand,

608
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:05,390
I mean I obviously I'm not a part of
the upper echelon out there and stuff,

609
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:07,030
but I think that's the reason they just,

610
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,380
they set up a patrol base and
they had the patrol bases,

611
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,360
but they pretty much just sat there and
got ambushed and got shot at every day

612
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,730
and didn't do a whole lot of patrolling.

613
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:21,220
So then you guys roll in and the like,

614
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:24,520
the broad strategy is you're going
to start moving from patrol base,

615
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,890
you're going to push out, take
another compound, secure it,

616
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,270
and then operate out of there for
awhile and then push, push on.

617
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,930
Pretty much just take the
Taliban's territory, um,

618
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,170
by going out,
clearing a compound.

619
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,650
And that's what a major part
of what I was doing it on.

620
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:47,270
This push was clearing compounds just in
case there are a booby trapped and then

621
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:49,670
we, yeah, we take over that
compound, sandbag it up,

622
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,200
knocked down some trees and some
explosives, create those fields of fire.

623
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:58,610
And then once I was set up to start doing
some patrols, security patrols and then

624
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,270
repeat. And where are you guys getting
in contact with the Taliban? Yeah,

625
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,260
more often.
They were pretty much shooting at us

626
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:10,370
most days.
Mortaring us most days.

627
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,540
Not very accurate.

628
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,203
MMM.

629
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,570
But yeah, they were shooting at us at
least. And we, we would go out on patrols,

630
00:41:16,571 --> 00:41:17,404
they'd shoot at us.

631
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,183
MMM.

632
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:23,460
But they're always shooting from way
far away. And you know, we'd shoot back,

633
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:27,600
but it wasn't like further on in
the deployment when the corns,

634
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,120
when the corn grew a lot taller.

635
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,330
I wasn't there for it cause I got hurt by
them. But that was when they were like,

636
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:39,770
people were shooting at each other in
the cornfield like five feet away. So,

637
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,430
so, but, but while you were there, it was
more distant, really far distant contact.

638
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,500
We were you guys taking any casualties?

639
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:54,060
I think not, not times. I mean
obviously every one is a major,

640
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:59,280
major sacrifice. But, uh, there
was one sniper that got killed,

641
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,620
uh, on the initial push on Lusa
Cola before we even got to Sangin.

642
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:08,430
And besides that,

643
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,280
I don't remember. Oh, my buddy Ron, he
got hit in the face with a piece of RPG.

644
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:17,730
Um, he didn't go home, he just
had to go get it taken care of.

645
00:42:17,731 --> 00:42:19,200
So minor stuff like that.

646
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,510
But yeah, minor stuff only
happens when stuff is going on.

647
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:26,230
And by the way, that little
piece of shrapnel, you know,

648
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,730
that thing can kill you just as easily
as a, you know, a full piece of shrapnel.

649
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah, exactly. Um,

650
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,120
but I would say so.
So you're,

651
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,420
you're like now every patrol that you
guys are going out is like, hey, now how,

652
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:44,110
how often are you finding
ids at this point?

653
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,920
Not Tons.
Um,

654
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:50,110
okay.

655
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,960
Trying to think. And then not very
often. Yeah. I mean cause the,

656
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,980
I think the area that we were in initially
was still pretty close to the main

657
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:05,160
farb and then as you went
out there would be, um,

658
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,570
just fields of them.

659
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,850
And the way that we
were getting out to the,

660
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:13,350
the patrol basis,
we were using Mikulics.

661
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:18,510
And so that was mitigating a lot of the
searching that we would've had to do.

662
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,113
Um,

663
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:26,020
so in that initial area weren't finding
tons, just every, every now and then.

664
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,050
And I, I don't, I don't know
if this is right or not,

665
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:30,390
but do you know what the
closer you get to a fob,

666
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:32,730
do you have security on the fob?
You have guys that are looking out.

667
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:35,970
So it's hard for someone to come in
and dig out and put it in an IED in the

668
00:43:35,971 --> 00:43:37,190
ground.
So you're,

669
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,280
you got some level of security
around the fobs most of the time.

670
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,630
Obviously there could be something there.
Preexisting and um,

671
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:51,190
day to day life. What are you
guys, are you guys on the Mras?

672
00:43:51,191 --> 00:43:54,390
Are you guys getting chow or what's,
what's going on day to day life?

673
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,860
Man,
I wished we had MRI.

674
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:02,220
So at some point during the
deployment we started on Mras and I,

675
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,500
you know, I like Mrs. I think
there were good, you're sick.

676
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,130
I used to like him Mre is a point.

677
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:13,760
I was like 22 and then I oded on them.

678
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,130
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't
mind them too much.

679
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,040
But then when we started
doing these pushes,

680
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:24,530
we got these things called first
strike rations and like the new MRE.

681
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,420
But here's the problem with these first,
right?

682
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,090
They were awesome when we first got
on the first week. They were awesome.

683
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,200
But the Marine Corps only decided to do
it would be good to buy three different

684
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,103
meals

685
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,100
and kind of at the same time
we had outrun our water supply,

686
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,870
so we were just stopping
off at wells and guess what?

687
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:52,320
Nobody be kind of purifying stuff.
Um,

688
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,790
so we were just drinking well water
and obviously what you would expect to

689
00:44:56,791 --> 00:45:01,170
happen happened. Everybody was
getting sick. Jazz, you know,

690
00:45:01,171 --> 00:45:02,820
diarrhea,
vomiting.

691
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:06,260
That's crazy.
No purification tabs or no,

692
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,240
I guess maybe they didn't
expect us to need to use wells,

693
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:13,330
but the first day everybody
ran out of water by the,

694
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:17,200
by the time we ended and we're like,
well, we just got to go get well water.

695
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,030
Isn't that crazy?
A purification pill is like,

696
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:22,870
I'm talking at you echo like
it's a little tiny thing. We,

697
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,830
you can carry them so easily and they
completely changed the game because you

698
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:30,700
can take that water out of the well or
a stream that's got whatever bacteria on

699
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:34,000
it. Put that pillow, put that thing in
there, shake it up, you're good to go.

700
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,590
Does it taste different? No, not really.
Not really. If people use them. Camping.

701
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,970
Yeah. This iodine tablets. And
you can also bring a filter.

702
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,620
Like when I hike, I bring a filter,
which is a little Plinko Britta pump. No,

703
00:45:47,621 --> 00:45:52,460
it's not a Brita pitcher. Knows about
that. A little pump. A little pump.

704
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,750
And how long are you guys
going out in the field for?

705
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,500
Um, let's see. The first push
Nimbus cloud was about two weeks.

706
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,010
And so we just, yeah, walk for two weeks.

707
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,070
We walked to a compound stop for the day,

708
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,640
set security, spend the night, walk
to the next one. If they shoot at us,

709
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,700
fight back, kill him, whatever,
do whatever we got to do.

710
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:19,610
And then we just kept
pushing out and pushing out.

711
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,540
And then eventually we got to a point
in that first, most of Galop push where,

712
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,890
uh, for whatever reason they
just, they just said, all right,

713
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:29,090
now you're going to walk back.

714
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:35,210
I think, I think maybe our, uh,

715
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,160
I think maybe our battalion commander
had actually been a little bit too

716
00:46:40,161 --> 00:46:45,161
aggressive and had gone beyond his
limits that his boss wanting him to do.

717
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:51,700
So we ended up having to give up
territory we had just taken and yeah,

718
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:53,390
so that one was two weeks.

719
00:46:53,391 --> 00:46:58,391
But then once we got to Sangin it was
pretty much spend a day doing the push,

720
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,680
take the compounds and then you kind
of in the compound you just go out and

721
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:08,200
patrol and then you come back. So we
weren't really out in the field field,

722
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:13,130
uh, for all that long. But you know, being
in a compound still not exactly luxury.

723
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:18,030
Yeah. You still want to have showers or
it's not the Kona Kai resort. Definitely.

724
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:20,750
All right man.

725
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:29,320
I'm going to talk about,
I'm going to go to your journal here

726
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:34,840
cause obviously on one of these uh,
patrols you got hit

727
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,890
and here's what you wrote about it.

728
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:39,983
Okay.

729
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:46,570
Two things happened simultaneously when
whatever explosive device that hit me

730
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:51,450
exploded.
First the shockwave cut through my toes,

731
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,650
severing them,

732
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,600
it didn't slow as it cut through
my shins, severing them. Next,

733
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,800
it's sent dirt,
Grit and shrapnel upward into my legs,

734
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,520
buttocks, and any other part
of my body that was exposed.

735
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,220
Okay.

736
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,720
Next. It launched me a few feet into the
air and deposited me onto the ground.

737
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:15,890
Unconscious

738
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,590
blood was pouring out of the newly
opened arteries and into the dirt.

739
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:22,910
Okay?

740
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:27,080
Muscle and bone dangled from
the remnants of my legs.

741
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,190
Okay?

742
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,630
Vicious bacteria latched on and
invaded through the note. New Openings.

743
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,400
The dust rose

744
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,000
and settled and I woke up

745
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,260
the first 10 seconds after waking up
all I could hear where my own screams

746
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,690
all I could see you as a blurry
tunnel looking up to the sky.

747
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,500
The weird thing about the screams was
that my brain wasn't telling my body to

748
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:58,334
produce them.

749
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:04,120
It was almost as if my mind was no longer
present and my body was just reacting

750
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,180
or more like panicking.

751
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:07,890
Okay?

752
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:11,490
They were the kindest screams that are
emitted from a person regardless of the

753
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:15,030
consideration of the personal
pride that the person has,

754
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:20,210
no matter how much their pride
makes them resist crying out,

755
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,220
they don't have a choice in the matter.

756
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,880
They inhale to lungfuls of air,

757
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,040
open their mouth as wide as it will
go and expel that air with full force

758
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,840
producing a scream that pierces the air
and change his pitch with no control.

759
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,400
As seconds clicked away,

760
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:45,630
my mind started to come back
online and my body calmed down.

761
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,260
Okay.

762
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,110
I stopped screaming and my
other sense is returned.

763
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:56,610
I smelled dust and the unique chemical
spell of the recent explosion.

764
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:01,210
I tasted it on my tongue and in my throat.

765
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:07,620
After that, my feeling came
back. It wasn't so much pain
as one would imagine it,

766
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,000
but more like my lower legs had
fallen asleep for so long that it hurt

767
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,320
except magnified by 50 times.

768
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:20,770
I knew that they were gone,
but how much,

769
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:22,210
okay.

770
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:25,960
I had decided before I left
on this deployment that I
could live with below the

771
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:29,660
knee amputations, but anything
higher than that, no thanks.

772
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,100
I'd rather bleed out.

773
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,980
I could hear Keith Johnson telling me
that they were coming for me and soon he

774
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:41,760
and Shane Ottewell were over me applying
tourniquets to the bleeding stumps that

775
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:42,810
used to be legs.

776
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:49,880
I mustered up the courage
to look at my hands intact.

777
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,220
I move them downward to check on
something vastly more important.

778
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,620
Yeah.

779
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:01,040
The numbness I felt down there
left me unsure of its status,

780
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,740
just kill me.
I croaked out.

781
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:08,940
They ignored me of course and kept
telling me how everything was going to be

782
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:13,750
okay. They were holding my hands as the
corpsman knelt over me and delivered the

783
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:16,810
sweet,
sweet morphine that made it all better.

784
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,720
Okay.

785
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,580
Kill me man. I said again. I don't want to
live like this. I think my dick is gone.

786
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:30,090
Your Dick is still there, man. Do you
want me to touch it? Johnson asked.

787
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,860
I chuckled. Were with
relief as I replied. No.

788
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,250
I asked whether the lug legs were
gone above or below the knee.

789
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,450
I was reassured to hear that
both were a few inches below.

790
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:50,070
By this time I was high from the morphine
and was saying everything that crossed

791
00:51:50,071 --> 00:51:50,904
my mind.

792
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:56,280
As the corpsman continued to work and
we waited for the 10 line CAS evac to be

793
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:59,340
called in. I thought about all the
things I wouldn't be doing anymore.

794
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:02,970
I thought about playing racket ball.
I thought about working out in the gym.

795
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:05,730
I thought about being in a
wheelchair for the next 50 years.

796
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,210
I never thought about how I was breeding,

797
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:13,710
bleeding profusely from two
major arteries and could die.

798
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,500
I never once thought I would die,

799
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:19,830
which may seem unusual for
a person in my position.

800
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:24,240
Naturally optimistic,
I suppose.

801
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,920
Although it is hard to claim that I was
being optimistic considering I wanted to

802
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:34,710
cash out permanently.
In my defense,

803
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:38,460
I had no idea what life was like as
an amputee and if I had back then,

804
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:42,720
I wouldn't have made that request
either way.

805
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,670
I'm glad I stuck around.

806
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,860
Around this time I decided to sit
up and take a look at the damage.

807
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,840
I took a deep breath and gulped.
I slowly started sitting up,

808
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:01,430
but when I got to the point where going
further would reveal my shredded legs,

809
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:03,140
I had a change of heart.

810
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:07,710
I didn't see the blood soaked dirt.

811
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,450
I didn't see the disjointed lower parts
of my calves and Chins along with my

812
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:16,770
feet or the jagged edge
of my remaining limbs.

813
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:21,060
The skin roughly burned and
shorten the bone sticking out.

814
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:26,080
Then the rip muscle dangling
along the ground. I didn't want

815
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,800
that image to be inside of my head because
I knew it would be one that I would

816
00:53:29,801 --> 00:53:30,940
never be able to forget.

817
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,110
I deeply regret the fact that there are
those that I consider friends that were

818
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:41,640
forced to have that image in their mind
and will have to live with with it for

819
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:45,830
their entire lives.
Secondly,

820
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,980
I was afraid of seeing the wound
would make it hurt even more,

821
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:53,570
much like a scraped knee.
As a child,

822
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:59,030
I laid back down and let the
morphine keep doing its job.

823
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:06,110
I started getting sleepy.
I just wanted to close my eyes.

824
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:12,350
I thought maybe if I closed my eyes,
I would pass away easily.

825
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,980
Slap Atwell's hand slap my cheek
as he yelled at me to stay awake.

826
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,100
Just let me sleep. Just let me sleep.
I mumbled closing my eyes again,

827
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,540
another slap.
That was the last time I did that.

828
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,830
Finally the stretcher that
was going to carry me out,

829
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,870
arrived for strong men,
lifted me onto it,

830
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:39,900
grab each one of the handles and started
carrying me to an assault breach or

831
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,734
vehicle.

832
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,100
They were carrying me away from the war
I volunteered to participate in and the

833
00:54:46,101 --> 00:54:48,890
marines that I was supposed
to be leading and protecting,

834
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,060
they would have to go on without me
all because I had failed in my job,

835
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:57,690
failed to find the Iud that I
knew was somewhere around us.

836
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:03,950
That failure was a hard pill to swallow
then and it remains so. To this day

837
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,810
I didn't feel good about leaving them
behind, but I knew they would understand.

838
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,380
I knew they would be okay without me.

839
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,420
We got to the assault breach or vehicle
and I asked Jimmy Goodwin one last time

840
00:55:21,641 --> 00:55:25,690
to put me out of my misery
after his refusal.

841
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:30,040
That was the last time I ever
contemplating accepting that avenue.

842
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:36,750
They slid me into the back of the vehicle
and with some marines I had never met

843
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,480
whose faces I can remember seeing but
don't remember any of their features.

844
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,790
The corpsman said he was going to give
me something to put me to sleep and I

845
00:55:45,791 --> 00:55:50,050
finally got to close my eyes
as everything went black.

846
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,183
Okay.

847
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:09,010
You're pretty clear about what happened.

848
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,660
I remember it pretty lucidly,
surprisingly. Yeah, I dunno.

849
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,710
Yeah,
I was,

850
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,220
I think I was unconscious for maybe 20
seconds I would estimate because they

851
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:20,054
hadn't even,

852
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,040
it hadn't gotten to me by the time I
woke up and I don't think they would have

853
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,530
spent a whole lot of time.
Yeah.

854
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:32,230
I think one of my guys might have cleared
over to me, but I, I, I don't know.

855
00:56:32,830 --> 00:56:37,830
I'm kind of wish I had thought
of something better to say like

856
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:42,310
it got me boys like free lesson learned,

857
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:45,410
preload a really cool sentence.

858
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,550
Dramatic moment and script to go
with just in case the critical point.

859
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,740
Oh Man, no, I wish I would have thought
of something better than Duke do there.

860
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,570
It makes sense. Oh yeah. That's
actually more important. Like I said,

861
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,730
that's something vastly more
important, but the interesting, yeah.

862
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:09,380
The thing about,
they said I was a below the knee.

863
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:14,510
And so a lot of the
[inaudible] times what happens,

864
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:17,060
you might be below the
knee at site of injury,

865
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,890
but like I said, infection,
that dirt over there is nasty.

866
00:57:21,891 --> 00:57:25,670
We're not used to their bacteria.
It'll get in there, it will in fact,

867
00:57:25,671 --> 00:57:29,880
and they have to end up chopping you off
higher to save your life because of the,

868
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,630
the infections,
just uncontrollable.

869
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,560
And also if they don't have viable tissue,

870
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:43,740
bones and muscles that they can sculpt
in such a way that you can put a

871
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,840
prosthetic on there,
they'll just cut you off.

872
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,100
Where at the next, you know,
viable spot, it would be

873
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,550
right.
And um,

874
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:56,970
there's gotta be like you,
you know,

875
00:57:57,030 --> 00:58:01,950
you had to have known or you, you'd
know this is a possibility, right?

876
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:05,400
When you're over there, how much did
you think about that possibility?

877
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,870
Okay. It's probably the same thing as
when you were going through Amani. I mean,

878
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:15,760
you know, everybody knows you could,
you could die, you could get killed,

879
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:20,360
but it's not going to be me. It's
fine. Not going to happen. Um,

880
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,260
but you kind of have to do that,
don't you? I mean, if you, if you,

881
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,150
if I'm sitting in there sweeping
and I'm thinking, okay, here we go.

882
00:58:28,151 --> 00:58:30,540
This could be it every step.
I'm not going

883
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:31,360
effective.
Yeah.

884
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,730
There's gotta be whether people refer
to it the way I referred to as the,

885
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:37,930
like the idea of detachment. And you're
just like, not going to think about that.

886
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,590
Everybody must be doing that because
otherwise she'd go freaking crazy.

887
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:45,060
Like if you were just thinking this next
step could be the one, I don't know, you,

888
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:47,050
you'd never be able to take a step.
You could handle it.

889
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,590
And you go out there on patrol and you
see Marines and soldiers and the seals,

890
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:52,270
they bear, no, everyone's doing their job.

891
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,460
Just completely setting that fear aside
and saying, okay, that's possibility.

892
00:58:57,461 --> 00:59:00,700
Cool. I don't have time to worry about
that right now. I'm going to get it done.

893
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,390
But, uh, I have,

894
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,290
I made a dark joke before
I went to Afghanistan.

895
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:10,470
I did this five k with a buddy
and he said, all right, well,

896
00:59:10,471 --> 00:59:13,890
we're going to do it again. And
when, when we get back from Afghan,

897
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:16,470
when you get back from
Afghanistan, I was like, yeah,

898
00:59:16,471 --> 00:59:19,260
except you're going to be pulling me in
a rickshaw cause I'm going to have both

899
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,340
my legs blown off.

900
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,800
He has yet to pull me in the rickshaw.
But

901
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:32,810
I talk about, you know,

902
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,750
fate or whatever. I don't know what, what,

903
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,210
that's just bad humor.
I think that's what we call that.

904
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,910
But you know what that is? That is a
way you deal with these things, right?

905
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,120
I mean like, hey, we were kind of
talking about in the car over here,

906
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:54,080
just like sick humor that you end up
with in the military because you have to

907
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:57,710
take that thought, which is in your
head. Like he's gotta be in your head.

908
00:59:57,860 --> 00:59:58,730
So what are you going to do with it?

909
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:03,230
Are you going to let it like burden you
down and make you inoperable and make

910
01:00:03,231 --> 01:00:05,810
you not be able to do your job?
Are you going to, you know what?

911
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:08,840
We're going to make a joke about it and
that's how we're going to get through

912
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,240
this. So more than anything
else, it's actually great.

913
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:14,060
I shouldn't have said bad
here and I should have said
great humor because that's

914
01:00:14,061 --> 01:00:17,460
the kind of humor that we'd hear
that all the time, you know,

915
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:22,070
all the time from guys from my seals were
ridiculous. My guys are just, I mean,

916
01:00:22,071 --> 01:00:25,640
the sickest sense of humor you
could imagine. And, but yeah,

917
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:28,970
the same thing with the soldiers and
there wasn't even, there's no barrier.

918
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,880
Like there's no barrier for that sixth
sense or humor when you're in the

919
01:00:31,881 --> 01:00:32,331
military,

920
01:00:32,331 --> 01:00:37,331
it's just like there and you're allowed
pretty much to say it across services.

921
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:38,961
You know,

922
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:42,790
you can make a joke to marine or an
army soldier about something and they,

923
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,930
they're not going to beat,
they're not going to be offended by it.

924
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:49,880
It's everyone's got that same
twisted sense of humor that really,

925
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:53,450
if you think about it, we're all probably
using to cope with, you know, the,

926
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,490
the fact that these bad
things might happen.

927
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:56,483
Yeah.
I think

928
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:02,460
I've often like try and
wonder why they say,

929
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:07,380
you know, laughter's the best medicine
and why it's so true. And I think it,

930
01:01:08,190 --> 01:01:11,580
it acts to normalize your situation.

931
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:17,030
So you know how if you're about to try
and dead lift like thousand pounds per

932
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:19,230
hour for you, something like that. Sure.

933
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:25,080
You're trying to deadlift 8,000
pounds and you're sitting there going,

934
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,660
there's no way I'm going to
dead lift this 8,000 pounds,

935
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:29,510
you're going to go up to it and
it's going to stick to the ground.

936
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:32,310
That predetermined a self
pre determination. Right?

937
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:34,680
And so if you're sitting there,

938
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:37,290
let's say after I got hurt
and I'm sitting there going,

939
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,180
this is the worst thing to ever happen.
This sucks.

940
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:47,580
I hate this. It's so serious.
It's such a big deal.

941
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:51,990
Then yeah, it becomes the
worst thing that ever happened.

942
01:01:51,991 --> 01:01:54,900
And I just kind of get into that groove.

943
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:00,180
But if you can make a joke about it,
it kind of makes fun of it.

944
01:02:00,181 --> 01:02:01,770
So it's not as serious.

945
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:07,020
And so when something's not as
serious or not as big a deal,

946
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:08,160
you make fun of something,

947
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:13,410
it kind of becomes normal to you and
a little bit easier to to accept.

948
01:02:13,411 --> 01:02:18,000
Like if you saw, if I saw my drill
instructor crack a smile at any point,

949
01:02:18,690 --> 01:02:21,810
if you like sit this
or anything like that,

950
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,490
then they automatically lose their,
their persona.

951
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,470
So if you could tell sometimes they
were getting ready to crack a smile and

952
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:33,660
they'd be like,
they just walk off.

953
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,270
I think you'd have to just walk away.

954
01:02:35,330 --> 01:02:35,991
So I think,

955
01:02:35,991 --> 01:02:40,700
I think that that's probably why you
have to maintain your humor in order to

956
01:02:40,701 --> 01:02:43,870
survive. You really do. Yeah,

957
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:47,670
no doubt about that. That's awesome. Um,

958
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,573
okay.

959
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:53,340
Going back to your journal here, it
took me five days to make it from dusty,

960
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:56,340
uncomfortable blast crater
and Afghanistan to a sterile,

961
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:01,370
uncomfortable hospital bed in the ICU
at the Nae National Naval Medical Center

962
01:03:01,531 --> 01:03:04,410
in Bethesda, Maryland. Luckily for me,

963
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:09,450
I was much too high on what's that
Dilla Dilla. The loudest dilaudid.

964
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:13,110
Dilaudid. Yeah. To notice
the bed or the trip.

965
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,930
My amputation said started
out below the knee,

966
01:03:15,931 --> 01:03:18,660
but somewhere during the three
hospitals stops along the way,

967
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:23,190
the need rows for the remaining
portions below my knees to be taken off.

968
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,850
A lot of the time.

969
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:29,640
This is due to infections that are
picked up from the dirt and Afghanistan,

970
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,900
or maybe there wasn't much that
existed below the knees to keep,

971
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:38,320
to make keeping them viable
on the bright side. However,

972
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:43,470
the stumps that were remaining were of
a significant length for an above knee

973
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:45,153
amputation.

974
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:50,680
I was left with the entire femur on my
left leg and only a few inches shy on my

975
01:03:50,681 --> 01:03:55,660
right leg. I found it funny that
throughout my entire hospital stay,

976
01:03:55,810 --> 01:04:00,760
the remainder of my legs
were always referred to as
stumps by the medical staff.

977
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:05,710
I had expected a more elegant
term considering the fact
that this was a hospital.

978
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,260
At the same time,
however,

979
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:12,550
I enjoyed the casual nature of the word
stump and even considered naming them at

980
01:04:12,551 --> 01:04:17,380
one point later when perusing my medical
records, I found the elegant term.

981
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:20,260
I had been looking for residual limb

982
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:26,830
along with the major injuries I sustained.

983
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:31,240
I also had a few minor injuries.
I use the term minor loosely here.

984
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,290
Seeing as how these minor injuries would
be considered major if they weren't

985
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:38,860
sustained in tandem with the
severing of one's lower legs

986
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:42,810
starting from the lower person portions.
First,

987
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:46,590
I lost a portion of the muscles making
up the inner part of my right Fi.

988
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,660
In order to close that wound,

989
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:53,370
I would require a skin graft taken
from the skin of my left fi my buttocks

990
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:56,640
contay or sustained several
large wounds from shrapnel,

991
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:01,140
some close to the sphincter,
but mostly in the more meaty parts.

992
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,060
That was okay though I have always
had an extra butt muscle to go around.

993
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,440
The close proximity of these wounds
to the working parts of the digestive

994
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:15,180
digestive system resulted in the doctor's
diverting my intestines to a colostomy

995
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:18,880
bag that came through my abdominal area.

996
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,510
The reason for doing this wasn't
because of any damage to the intestines,

997
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:25,720
but because the doctors wanted to make
sure that the large wounds on my butt

998
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:28,750
didn't get infected.
As for upper body injuries,

999
01:05:28,751 --> 01:05:32,830
I had some minor burns to my hands
and to totally perforated ear drums.

1000
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,430
The hands were Keel and my ear drums
would be replaced with cartilage.

1001
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:41,230
I consider myself extremely lucky that
I still have all 10 fingers in perfect

1002
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:42,100
working condition,

1003
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,350
my eyes and most significantly a brain
that made it through the blast with only

1004
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:50,380
a grade three concussion and no
residual traumatic brain injuries.

1005
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:54,970
While I may face hardships and have
some sort of discomfort constantly

1006
01:05:54,971 --> 01:05:58,560
throughout the day as a result of wearing
prosthetics, at least it doesn't hurt,

1007
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,160
hurt. I don't have constant
pain. Constant pain is much more.

1008
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:07,870
Har Wing is a much more harrowing plight
than mine and I can't imagine how hard

1009
01:06:07,871 --> 01:06:08,950
it is to withstand.

1010
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:14,440
I spent my first week at Bethesda
in the intensive care unit.

1011
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,590
I had a tube down my throat,
one tube going into my arm,

1012
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:21,670
a breathing tube in my nose, a catheter
pads, monitoring my heart rate,

1013
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:25,630
an epidural in my lower spine
and a wire from my pain button.

1014
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,140
Both my hands were wrapped
in gauze from my burns.

1015
01:06:29,350 --> 01:06:34,350
My legs were all so wrapped in gauze
along with having wound vac machines

1016
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:38,590
attached them to suck out excess
fluids leaking from my wounds.

1017
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:44,290
My rear end had a pat of gauze for
the wounds there. The incision down,

1018
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:48,520
the center of my abs use from our
colostomy had been stapled back together.

1019
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:53,740
And the bottom part, parts of my stumps
were where the skin was reconnected,

1020
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:54,910
were stitched together.

1021
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,700
Man, like I, you know,

1022
01:07:06,701 --> 01:07:11,230
you just, you, it's just piling
all that, all their stuff on too.

1023
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:14,860
And it just, like you said, you, you lost
your legs and you're like, oh, you know,

1024
01:07:14,861 --> 01:07:19,630
that's pretty much what a guy like me, I
focused, oh, he lost his legs, you know,

1025
01:07:19,930 --> 01:07:24,160
obviously freaking horrible. And then
you don't, you're like a guy like me.

1026
01:07:24,161 --> 01:07:28,000
I'm not thinking about all these other
injuries that you're sustaining and all

1027
01:07:28,001 --> 01:07:32,560
the medical things that have to happen
to get that stuff straightened out.

1028
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,410
Yeah. I mean, any one of those,

1029
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,980
just like if it happened
to one of us right now,

1030
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:40,290
any one of those would be major,

1031
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:45,870
but they're just pretty much nothing
compared to the actual major thing that

1032
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:46,704
happened.

1033
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:52,360
And, and you're just so, were you
just drugged up at this point? Yeah.

1034
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:57,120
Uh, that first week. I mean, yeah,

1035
01:07:57,150 --> 01:08:02,150
just dilauded Hayes hallucinations
and that kind of thing and surgeries.

1036
01:08:03,930 --> 01:08:04,763
Um,

1037
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:10,550
I would hallucinate nasty things like
being hit by a mortar and CMI leg

1038
01:08:11,431 --> 01:08:15,310
splattered for whatever
reason my mom was there. Uh,

1039
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:19,520
and then I recall for the
first couple of weeks,

1040
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,260
every now and then, I don't know
how to describe it with something.

1041
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:25,094
What happened?

1042
01:08:25,790 --> 01:08:30,620
You felt explosions before and there's
kind of that when the shockwave goes

1043
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:34,760
through you and you kind of feel
your brain kind of jar a little bit.

1044
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:38,780
And I would kind of feel that.
And then for a split second,

1045
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,360
I would kind of,

1046
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:45,290
it would be like I was getting hit by an
explosion for a split second of it like

1047
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:49,820
that. And I'd be like, did I just,
did I just pass out or something?

1048
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:53,960
And we'd be like, no. I was like, what
is that? So, but that, you know, that

1049
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:56,760
some kind of way,
like mental aftershock.

1050
01:08:56,940 --> 01:09:00,260
Yeah, I, yeah. I don't know what it
was. It's, I asked the doctors about it.

1051
01:09:00,270 --> 01:09:04,440
They said, well, I'm never, I don't know
what that is, but luckily it went away.

1052
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:09,780
And after maybe it had something
to do with the, the drugs,

1053
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,540
I don't know. But, uh, yeah, but you know,

1054
01:09:12,541 --> 01:09:17,340
eventually you get used to that body kind
of gets adapted to it and you get your

1055
01:09:17,341 --> 01:09:18,300
senses back.

1056
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:22,290
And it's hard to look at a computer screen
for the first couple of weeks still.

1057
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:25,770
But eventually I would
see ants crawling on me.

1058
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:28,230
Uh, but yeah, as you know,

1059
01:09:28,231 --> 01:09:33,231
so eventually all that kind of goes away
and you're just stuck with your little

1060
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:36,980
button for pain.
I remember they,

1061
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:40,320
you can only hit the little only
unless you hit it every three,

1062
01:09:40,321 --> 01:09:41,760
four or five minutes
or something like that.

1063
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:47,160
And they would come in during the first
little bit and they would say, you know,

1064
01:09:47,161 --> 01:09:51,390
you can only hit that thing like
12 times in a minute. Right.

1065
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,610
Is that, yeah. And then they
say, well, you hit it about
110 times in the last hour.

1066
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,540
And I'm like, well, I'd be, I,

1067
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,630
cause I'd be kind of like falling asleep
and then I'd hit it and be like, oh,

1068
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:08,640
make sure I make sure I got that hit the,
so I just hit it again.

1069
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,130
And so, yeah. And then,

1070
01:10:11,131 --> 01:10:15,600
but eventually kind of get used to
it and then paint starts to go away.

1071
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,180
I am sitting here thinking about like,

1072
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:22,170
I've been hospitalized a couple times
for a couple of different surgeries and

1073
01:10:22,171 --> 01:10:26,760
what a complete pussy I was,
you know, in they're like, oh,

1074
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:30,750
this hurts. You know, and I, I, you
know, this is, this is true, you know,

1075
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:34,050
repair something. Like I had a
hernia operation, I had neck surgery.

1076
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:38,100
Like these are planned operations.

1077
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:42,930
The openings in my body were made by
a highly skilled surgeon, you know,

1078
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:46,050
and I'm in, they're like, oh, this
sucks so bad. I mean, I can't,

1079
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,630
I like what you have is
like a thousand times,

1080
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,610
a thousand times worse and it's,
it's hard to even imagine.

1081
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:57,480
And then on top of this, I'm going back
to the journal here, to top it all off,

1082
01:10:57,481 --> 01:10:59,220
I had my pirate hat on my head.

1083
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,660
I was practically being
held together by duct tape,

1084
01:11:03,661 --> 01:11:05,250
like an old dilapidated chair.

1085
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:09,120
You're trying to get one or one more
good year out of what's up with a pirate

1086
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:10,050
hat.
Well,

1087
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:14,490
so you're not supposed to wake
up when you go through Germany.

1088
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:20,180
So basically you go from site of injury
to Camp Leatherneck to Bagram air force

1089
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:25,200
base to launch still Germany to Bethesda,
Maryland for marines,

1090
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:27,300
and then just go straight to
Walter Reed for anybody else.

1091
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:32,640
Marines and sailors go to Bethesda.
And so for whatever reason,

1092
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:36,630
I wake up in Germany
for, I don't know, 15,

1093
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:40,020
20 minutes and my squad leader was there.

1094
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:44,490
Uh, he was there for something else. I
don't remember what he was there for,

1095
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,050
but he, so he was there and I go, hey,

1096
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:51,240
you kind of told me what
happened and that kind of thing.

1097
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,370
And I just,
I couldn't help but think,

1098
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,080
even though it was super drugged up,
it was like,

1099
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,570
my mom is gonna not and
she's going to be sad.

1100
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:04,800
And so all I could think of,

1101
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:07,920
I'm always trying to crack a
joke or whatever. So I was like,

1102
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:12,360
see if you can see if you can
find a funny, he had heroin

1103
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,430
and he couldn't find one.
Right.

1104
01:12:17,550 --> 01:12:20,010
They're not going to have funny hats
in a hospital. It's a serious way.

1105
01:12:20,011 --> 01:12:23,710
So he went and looked, I guess maybe
he just went outside the rooms, the,

1106
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:24,623
I couldn't find one.

1107
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:30,300
A bog room has a lot of thing or
Germany has a lot of things, but uh,

1108
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,280
maybe not a funny hat store.
Uh, so couldn't find one.

1109
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:39,440
I get to Bethesda and when
you get to the hospital,

1110
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:44,470
they pick you up from wherever they fly
you into in these big basically semi

1111
01:12:44,841 --> 01:12:47,120
tractor trailer, Haas, uh,

1112
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:51,950
ambulances and they,
they have,

1113
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,660
they alert the hospital or we're coming,

1114
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:56,720
we're going to be there 2:00 PM and all
the doctors come down and they rush you

1115
01:12:56,721 --> 01:13:00,020
in and, uh, do what you need to do.

1116
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:05,050
And so a lot of the times that's
where families will see there,

1117
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:08,510
there are service men
when they first get back,

1118
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:12,380
when they're unloading them and they give
them Kinda, you know, 15, 20 seconds to,

1119
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:16,850
hey, good to see you. And
then they take you off.

1120
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:20,510
And I don't know how it happened,

1121
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:26,170
but I'm rolling down the thing and there's
my mom and she has this pirate hat in

1122
01:13:27,011 --> 01:13:27,844
her hand.

1123
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,580
I don't know if somehow they got
bored back to her. Still don't know.

1124
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,560
No, I haven't. I think I think
somebody else brought it.

1125
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:40,120
I don't think she brought it,

1126
01:13:40,121 --> 01:13:44,770
but I don't know why they would've brought
me a pirate hat unless somebody had

1127
01:13:44,771 --> 01:13:48,730
found out that I had asked for a
stupid hat or something. Cause I have,

1128
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:53,740
I've never been known to wear
pirate hats are stupid hats before.

1129
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:59,490
So there was my mom with a stupid hat
and then so it kind of became a theme.

1130
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:02,220
Like people would bring me a stupid
hat. What did, they came and visited me.

1131
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:05,620
So I had a big bag eventually.
But,

1132
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:08,530
so I guess what happened,
you know,

1133
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:13,600
I hope it kind of helped ease the pain
little bit from my mom. And that initial,

1134
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:18,970
that initial, uh, meeting
maybe a little bit, but uh,

1135
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:19,983
I dunno.

1136
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,990
So then you spend,
how long are you in?

1137
01:14:22,110 --> 01:14:25,920
Are you in like Icu for where they're
trying to get you more stabilized?

1138
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:29,220
I was probably there for about a
week and then you move up to the,

1139
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,050
the fifth floor for the hospital,

1140
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:35,920
which is kind of where they put all the
amputees and there were actually three

1141
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:40,360
Joneses there at the time.
So the nurses had to be very careful.

1142
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:45,610
And on top of that,
my I'm Jones are our first two initials.

1143
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,700
My buddy who got hit and maybe an
hour before me, his name is Jones,

1144
01:14:48,730 --> 01:14:53,140
d d and then the third Jones was Jones,
Jay Jay Dang.

1145
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,550
So they had to be on it with,
you know,

1146
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:02,860
with checking what medic cases
are going to, to who is, but yeah,

1147
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:07,600
so that then he'd go up to the fifth floor
and that's kind of where you start to

1148
01:15:07,601 --> 01:15:10,780
become lucid and that's where they

1149
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:16,960
physical therapists start to come in and
that's where once you're kind of ready,

1150
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:21,010
like you start just lifting a leg,
want 10 times, just lift your stomach.

1151
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:23,150
Then you describe that in your journal,

1152
01:15:23,151 --> 01:15:26,370
what it was like exhausting
for you to yeah. And it hurt.

1153
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:28,260
And what's making it,

1154
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,080
is it because you've been laying there
for so long is because it's a movement

1155
01:15:31,081 --> 01:15:34,920
that you haven't been able to do in a
while? I don't just all of the above.

1156
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:39,470
I would imagine a lot of that stuff down
there. It's just swollen and painful.

1157
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,620
You know, it's, I think that's probably
what it would be. And so yeah. Uh,

1158
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:47,090
it hurts so bad just
to even move it at all.

1159
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,980
And so they start with that and then
eventually you get in your wheelchair and

1160
01:15:51,981 --> 01:15:55,490
it takes about 10 minutes for you to get
into your wheelchair and tape belt for

1161
01:15:55,491 --> 01:15:57,950
people to get you into your wheelchair.

1162
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:02,390
Cause you're just like sliding off
and you just so sore. But you know,

1163
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,880
eventually you get better.
And I could, you know,

1164
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:09,650
I made a big deal about the first day
that I got in my wheelchair by myself and

1165
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:12,830
then I would go for
little rolls around the,

1166
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:17,780
the floor and somebody would
have to like, we all, my, uh,

1167
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:22,340
my little ivy pole and I have
to hang my catheter bag on the,

1168
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:26,360
that was so scared. I was, I was like,

1169
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:31,310
watch that tube to not let that
tube get caught into anything.

1170
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:37,970
And so yeah, I would, I would just do
a few laps around the ward, get out.

1171
01:16:39,020 --> 01:16:40,400
And then when I was done,

1172
01:16:40,401 --> 01:16:44,720
I go visit my buddy Daniel
because he couldn't get out
of bed yet cause he had a,

1173
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:47,620
I don't, I don't know why
you couldn't get out of bed,

1174
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:48,760
but he couldn't get out of bed.

1175
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:50,650
So I'd be on in his room and
hang out for a little while.

1176
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:56,190
And then how long is it before
you're thinking to yourself? Okay.

1177
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:59,970
Or what makes you start thinking,
oh, well this is my game plan.

1178
01:16:59,971 --> 01:17:03,450
This is where I'm going with like you
see guys that are further along the

1179
01:17:03,451 --> 01:17:08,160
process and you say, okay, I see what
that guy doing. You know? Yeah, I,

1180
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:10,100
I'm going to do that too. Well, I sent

1181
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,933
a little,

1182
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,693
uh,

1183
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:16,960
I phone message to Daniel who is too down
in the store down on the fifth floor.

1184
01:17:16,961 --> 01:17:19,030
And my body took a little,
and he was like, why don't
you say something to Daniel?

1185
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,590
And so I said, listen, first step,

1186
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:28,360
make a workout program to get back to
where we were before to get on our feet

1187
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:30,550
again. So it was a media, I was like,

1188
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:33,760
we are going to just work out
and we're going to get better.

1189
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:37,330
And you know,

1190
01:17:37,331 --> 01:17:40,900
so they don't do a whole lot of
prosthetics at Bethesda. Well they do now,

1191
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:42,940
but they didn't back then.

1192
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:49,020
And so the nurses would kind of have a
general idea of how the prosthetic stuff

1193
01:17:50,141 --> 01:17:52,000
went and the physical
therapist would know.

1194
01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:55,720
But the major thing was the
visits from Walter Reed.

1195
01:17:55,721 --> 01:18:00,721
So the wounded warrior battalion people
would bring people that were further

1196
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:05,560
along in their recovery over to visit
the guys that had just been freshly

1197
01:18:05,561 --> 01:18:09,250
wounded.
And so I got to one of those visits,

1198
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,050
I don't remember

1199
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:18,100
there being a double above
the knee amputee that came
to see me that was in legs

1200
01:18:18,101 --> 01:18:21,370
yet, but they had a better idea.
And they would say, look, you know,

1201
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:24,100
you're going to get over there and
you're going to get your prosthetics and

1202
01:18:24,101 --> 01:18:27,190
you're gonna be able to walk again.
You're going to be able to run,

1203
01:18:27,191 --> 01:18:31,640
you're going to be able to
do this and that. And so the,

1204
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:33,680
at that point I'm like,
oh, so I'm not going to,

1205
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,580
I don't have to be in a wheelchair
forever. Oh, okay. You know,

1206
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:39,320
so it was about at that point.

1207
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,820
And then what did w how'd you
develop your workout program?

1208
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,470
Well,
uh,

1209
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:52,120
once I became lucid, I was doing pull
ups on my little triangle. You know,

1210
01:18:52,121 --> 01:18:55,210
how they had the little triangle thing
dangling down, started getting after it.

1211
01:18:55,211 --> 01:18:56,980
I wasn't doing well,
I was doing pull ups.

1212
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:01,260
I was probably doing like a
horizontal rows or something. No,

1213
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:05,110
it's just like lifting myself up whenever
the physical therapist couldn't come

1214
01:19:05,111 --> 01:19:08,350
in and do her stuff with me, I was like,
all right, well I'm just going to do,

1215
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:11,650
he's going to pull myself
up on this thing. And

1216
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:18,280
so that was, and I kind of, I
went off the therapists, um,

1217
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,770
experience for the,
for most of it in the,

1218
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:27,150
in the beginning until I kind of got on
my own because I don't, you know, they're,

1219
01:19:27,151 --> 01:19:30,390
they've been doing this for
nine years at that point.

1220
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:34,510
So they had a lot of drills and
strengthened exercises that I can do and,

1221
01:19:34,530 --> 01:19:35,311
and that kind of thing.

1222
01:19:35,311 --> 01:19:40,311
So I just kind of let them take the
reins and just did whatever they said and

1223
01:19:40,561 --> 01:19:42,880
then did it again.
Um,

1224
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:47,020
but then once I got to a point
where I was, were kind of like,

1225
01:19:47,021 --> 01:19:49,200
where you see me now, I'm
walking around, no problem.

1226
01:19:49,980 --> 01:19:54,630
That's when I started venturing
into trying to do regular gym stuff

1227
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:58,890
and I invented my own way of doing
straight leg dead lifts. So it's,

1228
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:04,130
I strapped myself to a pole and I
sent it down to leaned down and I do a

1229
01:20:04,771 --> 01:20:07,740
straight leg dead lift as it put,
cause I can't squat.

1230
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:10,750
Right, right. Yeah. Uh,

1231
01:20:11,830 --> 01:20:16,600
I thought this was a really cool part of
your journal that you wrote and you're

1232
01:20:16,601 --> 01:20:20,350
talking about getting through
that kind of stuff. So here we go.

1233
01:20:20,351 --> 01:20:25,351
Back to the journal is easy
to be motivated to succeed
in the beginning of an

1234
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:28,750
endeavor and when you
are close to the end,

1235
01:20:29,530 --> 01:20:34,530
the most difficult part and the part
where people quit is when they are in the

1236
01:20:34,601 --> 01:20:35,434
thick of it.

1237
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:40,300
And it is unclear whether they have the
strength and stamina to make it the rest

1238
01:20:40,301 --> 01:20:41,134
of the way.

1239
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:46,120
While I never actually doubted my
ability to walk again during my recovery,

1240
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:51,070
I am certainly subject to the
inner monologue rationalizing,

1241
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:55,840
why does o k to quit or to not push myself
to the goal that I've written down on

1242
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:56,674
paper.

1243
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:02,690
One Way I've recognized to aid in
shutting that monologue the fuck up is

1244
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:06,630
celebrating milestones.

1245
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,560
The hardest part of working toward a
goal is when we are either making slow

1246
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:17,550
progress or negative progress and having
the patience and confidence to know

1247
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:21,750
that the improvements we make over the
long periods as opposed to the short

1248
01:21:21,751 --> 01:21:23,760
periods are what matter.

1249
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:25,240
Okay.

1250
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:29,500
Milestones are what reminds us that we
are making progress even if it isn't a

1251
01:21:29,501 --> 01:21:30,760
parent every day.

1252
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:32,030
Okay.

1253
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,863
In rowing,

1254
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,290
I've heard of people that count strokes
until the finish line using sets of 10.

1255
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:43,110
Personally I like to count two
fifties for making up a race.

1256
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,720
When I ran the nation's triathlon, I
picked points ahead of me to make it too.

1257
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:50,910
And when I got there I'd pick a new point.

1258
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:56,970
Anything we can use to keep our minds
from succumbing to the monologue will work

1259
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:01,330
not only in shirt,
short term goals,

1260
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:06,340
but also in longterm goals like
graduating from college or learning to use

1261
01:22:06,341 --> 01:22:07,330
prosthetics.

1262
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:12,830
Great advice for anybody
to pay attention to.

1263
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:15,060
Now you mentioned rowing there.

1264
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:20,780
So this was no like a weekend
row that you decided to do this.

1265
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:23,660
You got after it. Yeah.
So how'd that come about?

1266
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,900
Um,
so I was,

1267
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,610
I was looking for that workout
program. I knew at this point, hey,

1268
01:22:31,670 --> 01:22:36,410
I'm alive, I'm going to still try
and have the best life possible.

1269
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:41,540
And so
I'm trying to get back what I,

1270
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:43,940
what I lost so to speak.

1271
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:49,160
And I used to like working out and
go into the gym getting after it.

1272
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:54,140
And so, um, I'm sitting there going, well,

1273
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:58,100
what's the new, what's another
way that I can work out now? Um,

1274
01:22:59,510 --> 01:23:00,620
and so I started looking up,

1275
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,090
I forget what I looked up disabled
sports or disabled work at like Google

1276
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:05,933
something

1277
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,100
and Google getting Africa at Google.

1278
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,223
And

1279
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:15,640
so the Paralympics comes up.

1280
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,820
I don't know what the heck is apparel.
I know the Olympics,

1281
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:21,370
I don't know what the Paralympics is.
Is that like the Special Olympics?

1282
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:23,950
And the answer to that question is no.

1283
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:29,050
And so the Paralympics is the
Olympics for disabled people,

1284
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,390
for people with disabilities.
It was like, all right,

1285
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:34,480
well I fit into that category.
Let's see what sports they got.

1286
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:40,000
And I saw they had rowing I so well,
you know what I used to,

1287
01:23:40,990 --> 01:23:45,610
I used to hit the rowing machine when I
was working out getting on the concept

1288
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:50,230
two. Yeah. The concept to
doing some sprints on that
thing. That was pretty tough.

1289
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:55,000
And I want something that's tough.
So I was like, you know what,

1290
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:59,950
I'm going to see, I'm going to look
into this rowing thing and maybe I'll,

1291
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:03,940
maybe I'll make the Paralympics one day
and this is when I would just got to the

1292
01:24:03,941 --> 01:24:05,740
hospital like my second
week in the hospital.

1293
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:13,630
Not, not real strong point
in the page that says, Hey,

1294
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,610
you got to set yourself a goal right away.

1295
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,690
You don't have something you're
working towards, then you're just,

1296
01:24:20,350 --> 01:24:24,470
yeah. Tread water. Um, and so yeah,

1297
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:28,860
and a lot of things fell into
place. Uh, there was, uh,

1298
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:34,190
I probably didn't go out and try and
learn to row on the water until the next

1299
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:34,850
year,
so I was,

1300
01:24:34,850 --> 01:24:39,410
my main focus at that point was still
learning the prostate's getting my

1301
01:24:39,411 --> 01:24:43,360
strength back. But once I kinda got
my strength back and I was really,

1302
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:47,780
I felt like I was ready to move
on kind of outside of the therapy,

1303
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:50,630
uh,
angle on it.

1304
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:54,590
I looked up places where I could
learn to row and just, I mean,

1305
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:59,240
just so happened there was one in DC.
And so I went down there and I learned,

1306
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,890
and I mean I don't want to brag,
but the guy said I was a natural.

1307
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:09,050
So, uh, this is like,
well, maybe I can do this.

1308
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:10,610
And so I convinced the,

1309
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:13,160
they didn't have real machine in the
physical therapy clinic at the time.

1310
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:17,680
They had an elliptical,
they had all sorts of equipment.

1311
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:20,630
They didn't have a rowing machine.
So I convinced the

1312
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:22,850
clinic,

1313
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:27,850
whoever was running the clinic to get
a rowing machine for me so I could row.

1314
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,520
And then when I was trained
for the nation triathlon,

1315
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:35,840
I convinced them to let me bring my bike
in and, and ride my bike in the clinic.

1316
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:36,674
So I had my own,

1317
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:40,730
I've starting to build my own gym inside
the gym and I convinced them to get a

1318
01:25:40,731 --> 01:25:43,720
kettle bell for me and stuff.
Um,

1319
01:25:45,320 --> 01:25:49,970
and so I convinced them to let me,
uh, let me have that roll machine.

1320
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:53,060
And so a couple of times a week I would
go down to the water and train on the

1321
01:25:53,061 --> 01:25:58,010
water. The other times I would
just do some sprints on the,

1322
01:25:58,011 --> 01:26:02,960
on the rowing machine. And then it just
kind of kept, I kept getting better. And,

1323
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,480
and this was 20,000,
a 2011 so then the Paralympics or 2012.

1324
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,303
And

1325
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,080
is there like a specific
coach that runs the, the,

1326
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:16,190
the rowing team?

1327
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:21,740
There isn't
in some sports there are,

1328
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,160
there's like there's a head coach is
in charge of everybody in hell train

1329
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:29,600
everybody.
But for my category and Paralympic rowing,

1330
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:34,630
it's pretty much you find your own
coach and you show up at this race.

1331
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:36,580
And if you win that race then

1332
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,630
was that America and all the races
for that year. How far is the row?

1333
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:43,450
It's a thousand meters.
So what is that like?

1334
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:47,410
It takes you a couple minutes.
Three minutes.

1335
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:51,450
Um, so rowing, trunk and arms only,

1336
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,830
it was my category,

1337
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:58,490
so it would take me my best ever time
on the Erg was probably like three 38,

1338
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:04,320
I think. Um, and that's like
puke level put now. Yeah,

1339
01:27:04,321 --> 01:27:07,980
for me. Yeah. Um, and then on the water,

1340
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:13,740
the best in a double.
So two people,

1341
01:27:14,180 --> 01:27:15,330
um,
my category,

1342
01:27:15,331 --> 01:27:19,830
you have to have two people in the boat
was just right around four minutes.

1343
01:27:19,831 --> 01:27:22,620
If you could do four minutes,
then you had a shot at winning

1344
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,780
and that's a thousand meters to,
it's a thousand meters.

1345
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:27,550
So you're always gonna be a
little bit slower on the water.

1346
01:27:27,551 --> 01:27:30,310
And you say it's four minutes, you
said? Yeah, about four minutes.

1347
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,230
So it's like a complete gut check.
It's,

1348
01:27:33,231 --> 01:27:37,360
it's the equivalent of
sprinting like the mile. Yeah.

1349
01:27:37,450 --> 01:27:41,590
Cause you're going four minutes, right?
Forming a mile. I mean it's, it's no joke.

1350
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:46,030
It's a, it's a tough, tough, tough race.
And where was the Paralympics that year?

1351
01:27:46,490 --> 01:27:49,840
Oh, the Paralympics.
We're in London in 2012.

1352
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:55,150
And so I was just getting ready for that.

1353
01:27:55,151 --> 01:27:57,220
I was getting ready to retire.
I need something to do too.

1354
01:27:57,970 --> 01:28:02,970
And just so happened that my coach that
at the time knew somebody else and do

1355
01:28:04,331 --> 01:28:09,190
this, this other coach that had a female
that was, uh, looking for a partner,

1356
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:13,870
also a double above the knee amputee.
And so my boat classes, one guy,

1357
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:18,130
one girl. And so we met up, rode together,

1358
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:23,770
look like we were pretty good pair and
once I retired, moved down to Florida,

1359
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:28,390
started training for the Paralympics.
How long did you have to train?

1360
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:33,070
So I got out in
late December,

1361
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:36,520
so say called January 1st and

1362
01:28:38,020 --> 01:28:38,853
I,

1363
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:44,970
we had the Paralympic final
September 2nd or September 3rd.

1364
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,690
Okay, so you had a decent
chunk of time, but yeah. Good.

1365
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:50,730
Nine months of crushing yourself.

1366
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,570
Yeah. Train twice a day every day
or twice a day. Six days a week.

1367
01:28:57,230 --> 01:29:02,040
Take off Sunday and
just sprints, you know,

1368
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,880
technique a lot. Technique. Uh, yeah.

1369
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:08,260
Do you have to do the
technique in the water? Yeah.

1370
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:11,080
I mean you can do it outside of the
water a little bit, but it's really,

1371
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:14,650
you got to practice your technique
in, in the water. It's absurd.

1372
01:29:14,670 --> 01:29:18,240
It's like Jujitsu, you just got
to, it doesn't matter if you,

1373
01:29:18,241 --> 01:29:22,430
if you're doing like in an a
fake fake scenario you had,

1374
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:26,410
it doesn't really have the same effect
unless you're doing it in the real thing.

1375
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:30,820
Yeah. So you get to
England and boom. Yeah.

1376
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:34,390
How many races is there an
England? Is it just one race? No,

1377
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:38,080
luckily there was a couple of races.
So we had to do when the trials race,

1378
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:42,280
which was to find out who
represented America. Well, one that,

1379
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:46,090
and then we had to go qualify
our boat for the Paralympics.

1380
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:50,770
And so we had to go to Serbia about,
uh,

1381
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:55,420
maybe a month after winning the trials
to qualify the boat. So we won that race,

1382
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:58,670
qualified our boat,
and then Paralympics,

1383
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:03,690
you show up and you do your heat
and then if you win that right,

1384
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:06,370
how many boats are in heat?
A six.

1385
01:30:07,230 --> 01:30:10,860
So there were 12 boats stole
six in each eight, two heats.

1386
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:15,520
So if you win that heat, you automatically
go to the final. If you don't win that,

1387
01:30:15,521 --> 01:30:15,801
he,

1388
01:30:15,801 --> 01:30:20,650
you got to go what's called
the [inaudible] stands for
second chance in French.

1389
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:27,010
And uh, you have to come first or
second in that. So we want our episode,

1390
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:31,610
we lost our heat to the Chinese,
which still makes me so mad.

1391
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:35,740
And, uh, we want our rapid shock.

1392
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:40,780
So we were in the final and we started
the final and dead last and just slowly

1393
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:47,390
over the course of the race.
This was our race plan.

1394
01:30:47,391 --> 01:30:50,300
We kind of wanted to start
slow and build slowly.

1395
01:30:50,301 --> 01:30:54,920
We just wrote in one boat and the next
boat and the next boat until we got to

1396
01:30:54,921 --> 01:30:58,820
the end.
And we're about

1397
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:04,210
six. She, between us and the
great British vote, the home team,

1398
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:06,910
everybody's cheering for the home team.

1399
01:31:08,470 --> 01:31:12,280
And so third place gets a metal
fourth place. You don't get anything.

1400
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:16,080
You got nothing. Yeah. So,

1401
01:31:16,830 --> 01:31:21,540
and we're doing our final sprint and then
we crossed the line and I don't know,

1402
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,570
I, I wasn't looking over
there, my forearms were numb.

1403
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:29,250
I was just trying to hold onto the oars
and then it comes up on this little

1404
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:33,750
board, you know, first place,
China, second place friends,

1405
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,470
and then there's this,
this long pause,

1406
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:42,490
look it over there. Then it goes
third place USA. And I'm like,

1407
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:49,330
and you look at the video, it's literally
like the length of one of these knives.

1408
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:51,790
Yeah.
That close point,

1409
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:57,250
2.2 seconds between them and
us. That's crazy. So close.

1410
01:31:57,870 --> 01:32:02,360
So did you meet anyone while you draw
on that event? Right. You're right.

1411
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:07,380
You're telling me you met, avoid
over. I got it back. Oh, well, um,

1412
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,400
so I'll tell you

1413
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,730
when we were first got
there and we were training,

1414
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:19,480
we were doing, we would go out, we were
probably there a good week beforehand,

1415
01:32:19,481 --> 01:32:22,860
so we'd go out and train on the
lake and continue our training,

1416
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:25,320
get used to the area,
my partner and my,

1417
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,960
my role and partner and I
were watching the other teams.

1418
01:32:29,170 --> 01:32:32,800
And then there's another boat class
called the four. So it's four people.

1419
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
And I saw this great British for rode
by and there was this gorgeous blonde

1420
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:46,270
in the bow of the four.
And I said,

1421
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:48,340
I just bit my lip,

1422
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:55,540
like that's a good looking
chick, Eh, you know, I didn't,

1423
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:57,770
I never expected to meet her
or anything because you know,

1424
01:32:57,790 --> 01:33:01,110
we're not racing against each other and
she's from another team and you kind of,

1425
01:33:01,111 --> 01:33:05,410
you know, until the race is over,
you gotta be professional. Sure.

1426
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:08,950
She, even though she was
super nice, she was very high,

1427
01:33:10,240 --> 01:33:13,180
but you know, and she, she, uh,

1428
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:19,740
she'll tell me back when she told me
what she saw me around, I was looking,

1429
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,050
because I was in, I was just in serious
Marine Corps modes. Don't talk to him.

1430
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:25,463
Yeah.

1431
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:33,400
And so, uh, racing's over, we're
back in the athletes village.

1432
01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:35,440
It's time to get after it.

1433
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:41,860
There's a casino outside the
Athlete's village. So, uh,

1434
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:46,570
the American contingent goes out
to this casino starts, we're part,

1435
01:33:46,571 --> 01:33:48,820
I'm still at this point,

1436
01:33:48,821 --> 01:33:51,850
I'm still kind of in like serious mode.

1437
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:56,320
It takes a couple of days to get out of
it, you know, serious, serious mode, uh,

1438
01:33:56,410 --> 01:34:00,460
still a little bit pissed that
we lost to China and France.

1439
01:34:00,550 --> 01:34:05,260
And it's like the two people, the two
countries that my buddies were like,

1440
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:06,790
don't lose to China or France.

1441
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:11,620
They were taking shots like every two
feet they were following on at home and

1442
01:34:11,621 --> 01:34:13,450
they take the shot.

1443
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:18,500
They woke up so early in the morning.
Um,

1444
01:34:19,150 --> 01:34:23,890
so we're out there. Then the, the British
team comes in for that. Just one gold.

1445
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:26,080
Right. And they're all, they're all happy.

1446
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:30,850
So we're the only two groups
that speak English. So,

1447
01:34:30,851 --> 01:34:34,930
uh, yeah. So our two groups, you know,

1448
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:39,080
kind of end up together and it
took, it took them a while to, uh,

1449
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:43,780
get me to out of my shell
because I was like, you know,

1450
01:34:43,781 --> 01:34:46,660
still kind of on my guard.
I, yeah, this is the first,

1451
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:50,710
then maybe the second time I'd ever
traveled outside of America for anything

1452
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:53,530
besides deployments.
I had never traveled outside of America.

1453
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:56,320
Serbia was the first time
England was the second time,

1454
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:59,720
so it was kind of still
on my guard a little bit,

1455
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:01,730
but they started feeding me,

1456
01:35:01,731 --> 01:35:06,731
fosters lightened up and
then just so happened the,

1457
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,000
the gorgeous blonde I
saw was there. So, hey,

1458
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:16,170
you guys know how charming
I am. So charmed her, well,
you at least fooled her.

1459
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:22,820
I'm sure the alcohol helped, you know,
but a charmed her and now we're married.

1460
01:35:22,821 --> 01:35:27,200
So that's awesome. After four years
of long distance relationship,

1461
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:28,310
because he kept rolling,
she,

1462
01:35:28,370 --> 01:35:32,330
she actually defended her a gold
medal in Rio and did it again. Yeah.

1463
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:36,460
Got Gold again. So we did, we did about
a, we didn't get together right away. We,

1464
01:35:36,490 --> 01:35:40,310
we did a long distance
for about three years.

1465
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:43,570
She live in England and I was
living in America, but uh,

1466
01:35:43,610 --> 01:35:48,080
finally got her over here. We're married.
Yeah. Her name's Pam. Nice. Okay.

1467
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:52,020
Well obviously I have a certain
affinity for British ladies as well.

1468
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:54,690
Pretty well known.
Uh,

1469
01:35:55,520 --> 01:35:58,910
now you mentioned real quickly you
were training for triathlon in there

1470
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:02,760
somewhere too. Yeah. So
the people at the clinic,

1471
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:08,370
it was a, I mean it was
a team effort. Everybody,

1472
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:09,293
so,

1473
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:10,570
okay.

1474
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:12,670
They were other,
other amputees in there.

1475
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:15,250
And I mean we talk about
this a little bit yesterday.

1476
01:36:15,251 --> 01:36:20,251
Dan Can Austin navy seal that was
there for a year before me and Anne

1477
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:25,300
Paralympian as well? Yeah. Oh yeah.
Paralympian to the biathlon. Um,

1478
01:36:25,870 --> 01:36:27,040
he was my,

1479
01:36:28,970 --> 01:36:32,990
my idol I guess for
when I first got there,

1480
01:36:32,991 --> 01:36:36,230
cause he was pretty much done with
therapy. He was about to get out.

1481
01:36:36,231 --> 01:36:39,360
He was walking everywhere on his legs,
Karina backpack around.

1482
01:36:39,390 --> 01:36:42,790
And he was almost the exact same injuries.

1483
01:36:42,810 --> 01:36:45,140
You just above the knee.
Yeah.

1484
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:50,730
And so I could see him from when I
was just sitting in a wheelchair.

1485
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:54,260
Right. All right. That
is, it's possible. Yeah.

1486
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:58,050
Because I'm seeing it with my own
two eyes. It is possible. And so,

1487
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:01,570
and he's a stud and yeah,
if you want us to,

1488
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:06,140
if you want to try and be like anybody,
it's be like damn. Cause Yeah. Um,

1489
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:08,100
and so that's kind of the,

1490
01:37:08,101 --> 01:37:13,101
the environment that they had there at
Walter Reed was you could ask somebody

1491
01:37:13,371 --> 01:37:17,090
that had been there before,
tips, tricks, anything like that.

1492
01:37:17,390 --> 01:37:22,390
And so I saw Dan and I was asking him
stuff and just watching how he did stuff.

1493
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:27,770
And then eventually he left and I
kind of noticed, you know, I am now,

1494
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,910
there's new guys coming in and I'm
now that person that has been there.

1495
01:37:31,911 --> 01:37:36,911
And so I need to step into that role
and offer advice and work harder than

1496
01:37:37,131 --> 01:37:41,030
anybody else in the clinic and show
people what's going on and show people

1497
01:37:41,031 --> 01:37:45,080
what's possible.
And so the therapists would always be,

1498
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:51,410
hey, you want, who wants to run the army
10 miler? Who wants to do this triathlon?

1499
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:52,290
They'd always be getting offers.

1500
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:56,070
They ought to be getting slots in races
because people love having wounded

1501
01:37:56,071 --> 01:37:58,350
warriors out there.
So they make a big deal.

1502
01:37:58,351 --> 01:38:03,270
But they get let them go off
first and everything. So yeah.

1503
01:38:03,271 --> 01:38:05,550
So,
and every time they asked me if I could,

1504
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:08,000
if I wasn't doing anything else that
day, I'd be like, yeah, yeah, I'll do it.

1505
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:12,990
And so they're like,
you want to do the nation's triathlon?

1506
01:38:12,991 --> 01:38:17,991
It's a Olympic distance triathlon and
there's like two people doing it and no

1507
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:22,140
other, it's like a single below the
knee amputee doing it and that's it.

1508
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:27,210
And you're a double above
knee amputee. You want to do
it? Yeah, I do. And it just,

1509
01:38:27,211 --> 01:38:31,260
so, cause it just so happened at the
time I was learning how to ride a bicycle

1510
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:32,730
again,
normal bicycle.

1511
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:37,320
So you're learning how to
ride a bike, might as well do
a triathalon. Exactly. Hey,

1512
01:38:37,321 --> 01:38:40,770
you got to give him, one of the
things that's going to drive you

1513
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:46,090
to push yourself is having skin in
the game. Having something to lose.

1514
01:38:46,091 --> 01:38:50,230
Having said that in a risk.
So if you say to everybody in the clinic,

1515
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:55,000
I'm going to do the nation's triathlon
and you don't do it, you're an idiot,

1516
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:56,520
you're a loser.

1517
01:38:57,590 --> 01:39:01,370
How long has the Olympic
triathlon? Uh, Olympic

1518
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:04,650
stents,
the swim is 1500 meters.

1519
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:10,700
The bike is 40 kilometers
and the run is 10 kilometers.

1520
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:17,010
Um, luckily for me, cause I
wasn't not that good at swimming,

1521
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:21,330
luckily for me the swim got canceled that
year because there was a huge storm as

1522
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:24,510
a ton of debris in the Potomac.
So we didn't do the swim,

1523
01:39:24,511 --> 01:39:29,020
but we did the bike and the run and yeah,
so I was,

1524
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:30,900
I was relearning how to ride a bicycle.

1525
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:34,860
Nobody had ever done that before in the
history of Walter Reed double above the

1526
01:39:34,861 --> 01:39:36,420
knee amputee trying to ride a bicycle.

1527
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,350
And I had figured it out and I kind
of wanted to put it to use, you know,

1528
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:44,820
like I finally figured this
thing out. Um, and so, oh,

1529
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,760
what better way to do it then
do the nation's triathlon.

1530
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,700
And so it was like,
you know,

1531
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:55,170
baptism by fire in a way.

1532
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,900
And so it took me like four hours
to do the whole thing. Okay.

1533
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:03,090
Did you enjoy it?
I enjoyed having done it.

1534
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,243
Okay.

1535
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:08,350
Cause I'm just wondering at what point
you made the brilliant decision that you

1536
01:40:08,351 --> 01:40:12,170
are going to ride a freaking bicycle
across the United States of America.

1537
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:18,040
Well which was your next we'll whatever
freaking psychotic idea you got again.

1538
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:19,640
Where'd that come from?

1539
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:25,840
I had just learned how to ride the bike
going. I got to do something with it.

1540
01:40:25,841 --> 01:40:29,180
I can't make it just this pointless.
I learned that okay I did it. No,

1541
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:32,860
never got to do it again. I was
like, you know what might be fun.

1542
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:36,790
It's just like riding my bike across
the country at some point in my life and

1543
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:39,250
this is what I have. I'm not
even, I'm still in the hospital.

1544
01:40:39,251 --> 01:40:40,750
I just learn how to ride the bike.

1545
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:44,170
I should do something like ride my bike
across country, something like that,

1546
01:40:45,340 --> 01:40:47,410
you know,
some something cool like that.

1547
01:40:48,580 --> 01:40:52,840
And I was rowing, I didn't do it
right cause I, I had, I had made the,

1548
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:55,000
to do the rowing. Right. So
it's, I'm going to do rowing,

1549
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:58,300
but eventually I will do
this cross country bike ride.

1550
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:01,470
And so I did another year
of rowing after that I,

1551
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:04,630
I took the time to kind of plan
it out how I wanted to do it.

1552
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:10,710
And so it took another year of rowing and
then finished world championships that

1553
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,390
year and forth.
Um,

1554
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:18,670
and about a month later drove up to Maine,
started riding.

1555
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:24,860
This is in October. And so what was
that? What was that all uh, what was the,

1556
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:29,640
what did that day to day look like? Uh, so

1557
01:41:31,170 --> 01:41:31,660
okay,

1558
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:36,430
I had a box truck or you haul box truck.
I bought like a used 200,000 miles.

1559
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:38,510
You help box truck check my,

1560
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:44,380
I laid down some carpets in the back
check, uh, had a couple of cots,

1561
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:46,150
couple of sleeping bags,
supplies

1562
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:52,540
and my little brother who is
about to turn 18 check, uh,

1563
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:57,130
rogered up to drive. Good to go. That's
all you need right there. Box truck water,

1564
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:02,110
two cots carpet and a little brother.
And so,

1565
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:04,710
you know,
really trained much.

1566
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:09,750
What I did was I made sure
that my prosthetics fit
correctly and I was able to

1567
01:42:09,751 --> 01:42:12,840
ride the bike. That's all I
really did. I didn't, you know,

1568
01:42:12,870 --> 01:42:16,620
go out and ride a hundred
miles or anything, any kind
of formal training for it.

1569
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,410
Yeah. Cause I figured what
is the point. Yeah, exactly.

1570
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:25,520
Just start and the beginning is the
training for the finish. Yeah. So

1571
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:31,600
the day to day would be
wake up probably six,

1572
01:42:31,601 --> 01:42:34,360
seven o'clock,
you know,

1573
01:42:34,361 --> 01:42:37,210
drive out to wherever I was starting
for the day cause he couldn't,

1574
01:42:37,211 --> 01:42:39,190
you can't just like
stop and then pull over.

1575
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:41,800
So we'd have to like
drive the truck somewhere,

1576
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:47,080
park it in a church parking lot or a
fire department parking lot and then uh,

1577
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:53,340
don't get apprehended by the cops.
So the first time,

1578
01:42:53,341 --> 01:42:54,820
so I had,
I was right,

1579
01:42:54,821 --> 01:42:57,600
I mean I'd be riding my bike and then
my brother would be kind of half on half

1580
01:42:57,601 --> 01:43:01,450
off the road. And I picked a route
that we didn't have, you know,

1581
01:43:02,050 --> 01:43:03,670
not super busy roads.

1582
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:07,060
So I wouldn't get in too many people's
way until I got the Pacific coast highway.

1583
01:43:07,061 --> 01:43:10,300
And then people were super pissed.
And uh,

1584
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:13,180
at one point this cop,

1585
01:43:13,181 --> 01:43:16,930
the for the first cop I encountered
pulls over in front of us. I'm like,

1586
01:43:16,931 --> 01:43:20,170
all right, here we go. He's going
to tell me to stop the ride's over.

1587
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:24,430
And then he gets out and he's like,
I just want to shake your hand, man.

1588
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:27,610
It was like, phew, okay,
this is how it's going to go.

1589
01:43:27,640 --> 01:43:31,600
This is so I'm going to
get the cops love me. Um,

1590
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:35,080
and so I wake up,
start riding probably around seven 38.

1591
01:43:35,620 --> 01:43:39,340
I might eat breakfast
beforehand. Um, probably ride.

1592
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:43,450
Yeah,
I would do 30 miles a day,

1593
01:43:43,451 --> 01:43:46,930
so I'd just break that up however
I felt for the day. Take breaks,

1594
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:50,560
hop in the back of the truck,
sit around for a while and run.

1595
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:54,470
I'd ride 30 miles and then
wherever I finished 30 miles,

1596
01:43:54,471 --> 01:43:56,750
I might go a little bit further
for a better spooling off point.

1597
01:43:57,380 --> 01:44:02,380
Stop getting the truck drive
off to wherever we might
be able to park the truck

1598
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:08,800
and then spend the night in the truck and
then a drive back out to that spot the

1599
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,420
next day. Do it again. Luckily for me,

1600
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:20,090
a lot of hotels started
to offer us night's sleep.

1601
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:22,310
So we really on this sleep in
the truck for the first month,

1602
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,890
and then after that we were
mostly in hotels. Okay.

1603
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:29,990
And this was like a six month journey.
Six months, October to October to April.

1604
01:44:30,420 --> 01:44:33,860
So she did it through the winter time.
Yeah. You ever heard of the polar vortex?

1605
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,560
No. No. What those pull
their Fort Texas here,

1606
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:42,620
like this freezing temperatures that
came down and attacked the nation with

1607
01:44:44,151 --> 01:44:48,930
cold, they called him the polar vortex. It
sounded very threatening. It's one step,

1608
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:51,340
one step higher than a shark.
Nedo

1609
01:44:54,900 --> 01:44:59,130
uh, 5,000, 180 miles.
Yeah. In the winter time.

1610
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:01,470
Every day for 180 days.

1611
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:02,320
Okay.

1612
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:05,110
Um,
talk about fortitude.

1613
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:05,910
Okay.

1614
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:10,200
In your journal, and I'm going
to read it. It was through,

1615
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:14,280
it was through the true purpose of the
Marine Corps that I became what I am

1616
01:45:14,281 --> 01:45:17,220
today. And it is that, it is that,

1617
01:45:18,330 --> 01:45:22,920
and that is the act of fighting
the battles of the United States.

1618
01:45:24,210 --> 01:45:29,010
It is through the preparation for and
the fighting of America's wars that

1619
01:45:29,011 --> 01:45:30,090
marines gain.

1620
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:35,040
They're fine edge and an idea
of the true meaning of courage,

1621
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:39,060
Spirit, tenacity,
altruism and brotherhood.

1622
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:44,070
After having been imbued with the
essential qualities ascribed to marines in

1623
01:45:44,090 --> 01:45:44,880
bootcamp,

1624
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,140
it is up to the individual marine and
his leadership all the way from the fire

1625
01:45:49,141 --> 01:45:53,640
team leader to the commandant to
make him the ideal tool for the core.

1626
01:45:54,650 --> 01:45:55,230
Yeah,

1627
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:57,840
and there's no better place
than a war to do this.

1628
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,250
Yeah.

1629
01:45:59,250 --> 01:46:02,790
It was during my two deployments that I
learned what it means to be courageous

1630
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:05,400
almost on a daily basis.

1631
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,900
My fellow marines and I would be subjected
to situations with high potential for

1632
01:46:09,901 --> 01:46:13,470
danger and situations
with infinite unknowable,

1633
01:46:13,530 --> 01:46:14,970
possible outcomes.

1634
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:16,040
Okay.

1635
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:19,820
The dangerous and unpredictable nature
of these conditions elicits fear,

1636
01:46:19,970 --> 01:46:23,060
nervousness and uncertainty in all people.

1637
01:46:24,170 --> 01:46:24,680
Okay.

1638
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:27,230
However,
without fail,

1639
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:32,770
when the time came to strap on our gear
and proceed forth into these conditions,

1640
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:37,430
we did it with no hesitation
because it was what we needed to do.

1641
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,060
Okay.

1642
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:42,430
To me,
that is courage.

1643
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:48,590
I learned it from the example set by my
leaders and my compatriots and when it

1644
01:46:48,591 --> 01:46:53,150
was my turn, I endeavored to
teach others by my own example.

1645
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,430
Okay.

1646
01:46:55,430 --> 01:47:00,430
My favorite among the many mantras of
the Marine Corps is adapt and overcome.

1647
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:06,470
It is my favorite because it embodies
the spirit and tenacity that marines must

1648
01:47:06,471 --> 01:47:10,100
possess in order to be the world's
greatest war fighting force

1649
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,473
two marines.

1650
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:17,630
Accomplishment of their mission is of
the utmost importance above that of their

1651
01:47:17,701 --> 01:47:22,260
own lives and the ability to
adapt and overcome is key.

1652
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,220
Okay.

1653
01:47:24,220 --> 01:47:29,220
The idea is straight forward
change whatever you need
to in order to become what

1654
01:47:31,271 --> 01:47:34,150
is required to transcend an obstacle.

1655
01:47:36,010 --> 01:47:39,790
If there is no bridge over a river,
a marine will swim.

1656
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:40,670
Yeah.

1657
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:43,730
If there was a wall in front of us,
we will blow it apart.

1658
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:48,560
If there was an enemy on a hill
that we want, we will remove him.

1659
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:53,320
Marines do not stop until they
have accomplished their mission,

1660
01:47:53,710 --> 01:47:57,040
regardless of any monkey wrench
that gets thrown into their plan,

1661
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:03,290
they will change their plane plan a
thousand times if it need be until what

1662
01:48:03,291 --> 01:48:05,060
needs to be done is done,

1663
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,210
and then they will move
on to the next mission.

1664
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:13,860
It was these two qualities that kept me,

1665
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,710
that allowed me to keep
fighting after hours wounded.

1666
01:48:17,430 --> 01:48:17,750
Okay.

1667
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:21,770
My plan of accomplishing something with
my life and making my life as good as

1668
01:48:21,771 --> 01:48:25,190
possible was met with
obstacles and monkey wrenches.

1669
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:26,360
Okay.

1670
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:29,480
But since I had already
learned these lessons,

1671
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:34,520
bypassing these obstacles and
moving on was easy and natural,

1672
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:37,040
okay.

1673
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:41,240
The Brotherhood that they're marines
share is the defining feature that

1674
01:48:41,241 --> 01:48:44,850
initially attracted me to the Marine
Corps and over the course of two

1675
01:48:44,851 --> 01:48:47,880
deployments,
I experienced it to its fullness.

1676
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:53,070
The reason that I was able
to be courageous and adapt
and overcome was because

1677
01:48:53,071 --> 01:48:55,730
of the men that stood beside
me doing the same thing

1678
01:48:57,670 --> 01:49:02,670
and is because we were experiencing war
and hardship together that we goo grew

1679
01:49:02,711 --> 01:49:07,300
close enough that I cared for
them more than I cared for myself

1680
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:13,380
and which sacrifice my safety for
their wellbeing even if it meant being

1681
01:49:13,381 --> 01:49:14,490
extinguished

1682
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:19,820
and although it never needed to be said,

1683
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,910
I knew this was reciprocated.

1684
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:25,930
Okay.

1685
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:30,250
To me, this is the definition
of brotherhood and selflessness.

1686
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:31,430
Okay.

1687
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:36,430
And from my having been part of such a
relationship is why I am loyal and put

1688
01:49:36,890 --> 01:49:41,890
others before myself as if
it were a default setting.

1689
01:49:46,840 --> 01:49:47,950
Without the Marine Corp,

1690
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,010
I have no idea where I would
be or what I would be like.

1691
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:57,540
All I can say for sure is that I am what
I am now due in large part to what I

1692
01:50:00,941 --> 01:50:05,941
was taught and what I experienced during
my five years in the Marine Corps.

1693
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:08,933
Yeah.

1694
01:50:15,450 --> 01:50:19,710
Yeah. Awesome. If there's anything
that the Marine Corp teaches you,

1695
01:50:20,240 --> 01:50:24,750
it is brotherhood.
It is

1696
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:30,150
endurance.
How to endure

1697
01:50:32,140 --> 01:50:35,960
situations. You don't
want to have to be, uh,

1698
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:42,330
whether it's humping around with
a pack or fighting in Afghanistan,

1699
01:50:43,241 --> 01:50:44,074
Iraq,

1700
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:47,500
or if it's sitting in the back of a seven
ton and getting drenched in rain and

1701
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:52,480
then having to set up a tent, blah, blah,
blah. It teaches you those things. And so

1702
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,480
I already knew all this stuff.

1703
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:59,560
I was good at it by the
time I became an amputee.

1704
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:05,050
And then I got even better
at it once I was an amputee,

1705
01:51:05,140 --> 01:51:07,420
even more experience.
And then,

1706
01:51:07,421 --> 01:51:11,890
so that led into being able to endure
whatever I had to for the bike ride.

1707
01:51:12,910 --> 01:51:17,910
And I think the slogan slogan for the
wounded warrior regimen in the Marine

1708
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:21,470
Corps is, I don't know if this is,
it's Latin, I don't know if it's,

1709
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:24,070
I'm pronouncing it right.
It's [inaudible] and [inaudible],

1710
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:25,990
which is still in the fight.

1711
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:29,890
And you know,

1712
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:34,980
I'm not still in the main fight that's
going on in Iraq or Afghanistan.

1713
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:42,130
I've been taken out of that fight,
but the overall fight,

1714
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:48,670
I'm still in that.
I'm still a representative of America.

1715
01:51:48,671 --> 01:51:50,680
I'm still representative of marines.

1716
01:51:51,730 --> 01:51:56,730
I'm dedicating myself to help my
brothers that are struggling or come back

1717
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:02,380
wounded.
I'm still in that portion of the fight.

1718
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:07,240
And I mean, just remember,

1719
01:52:07,241 --> 01:52:10,720
you just have to remember that that
slogan to stay, stay in the fight,

1720
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:11,643
just keep fighting

1721
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:17,590
are obviously you're staying
in the fight. And I, I, I

1722
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:19,711
again,

1723
01:52:19,711 --> 01:52:24,360
reading through your journal stuff is
awesome and there's a bunch of different

1724
01:52:24,361 --> 01:52:28,560
things that I wanted to pull
out and obviously I can't
read the whole damn thing,

1725
01:52:28,590 --> 01:52:33,210
right? Maybe I could, but I'll leave
that for you. Uh, but one of the things,

1726
01:52:33,211 --> 01:52:36,630
you know, I'm always
thinking that what, you know,

1727
01:52:36,631 --> 01:52:39,600
what can I pull out that I think will
be really helpful to other people.

1728
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:45,470
And I thought that this thing that you
wrote right here was just something that

1729
01:52:46,641 --> 01:52:48,710
can be used by,
by anybody,

1730
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:52,850
especially people that are
facing tough situations,

1731
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:54,620
which as you just mentioned,

1732
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,840
you are pretty Dang good at
dealing with tough situations.

1733
01:52:59,841 --> 01:53:01,880
And I think this gives a
little insight into that.

1734
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,160
So here we go back to your journal.

1735
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:09,020
The Kubler Ross model explains the stages
by which an individual grieves for a

1736
01:53:09,021 --> 01:53:13,700
lost intimate. The five stages
are denial, anger, bargaining,

1737
01:53:13,730 --> 01:53:17,240
depression, and acceptance. In this case,

1738
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:20,480
it could be said,
I was grieving for myself,

1739
01:53:21,320 --> 01:53:23,750
the former me that had died in Sangin.

1740
01:53:24,700 --> 01:53:25,290
Yeah.

1741
01:53:25,290 --> 01:53:30,290
Since I had a natural understanding of
conservation of energy and an awareness

1742
01:53:30,751 --> 01:53:33,240
of the time required to reach my goal,

1743
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:38,250
I instinctively skipped the first four
steps and proceeded the acceptance

1744
01:53:38,340 --> 01:53:39,660
portion of the process.

1745
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,480
I had decided that to spend my
limited energy resources on denial,

1746
01:53:45,840 --> 01:53:47,280
anger,
bargaining,

1747
01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:52,400
and depression would be a pointless
waste and would be better left off of my

1748
01:53:52,621 --> 01:53:53,454
itinerary.

1749
01:53:54,240 --> 01:53:54,550
Okay.

1750
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:58,810
I want her to be able to expand as
much energy as I could toward my goal,

1751
01:53:59,380 --> 01:54:02,050
which would not only allow
me to reach it faster,

1752
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:04,750
but would improve the
quality of my success.

1753
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:05,960
Okay.

1754
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:08,420
The sooner I had accepted my situation,

1755
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:11,180
the sooner I could get
to where I want it to be.

1756
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:18,230
Having one's legs amputated above
the knee is categorically a negative

1757
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:23,530
experience. If I hadn't had
the right mindset afterward,

1758
01:54:23,710 --> 01:54:28,690
the rest rest of my life could have
also become a negative experience.

1759
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:30,663
Fortunately,

1760
01:54:30,760 --> 01:54:34,780
I was able to react to the loss by
accepting the negative energy from that

1761
01:54:34,781 --> 01:54:39,781
occurrence and using it to open doors
for myself in order to be sure that my

1762
01:54:41,171 --> 01:54:43,660
life would remain a positive experience.

1763
01:54:44,620 --> 01:54:45,060
Okay.

1764
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:46,560
No matter who you are,

1765
01:54:47,250 --> 01:54:52,170
whether you are healthy or
ill injured or able bodied,

1766
01:54:52,740 --> 01:54:56,940
everyone's main purpose in life
is to make it as good as possible.

1767
01:54:57,990 --> 01:55:02,460
This is an unchanging objective for
all people. No matter what happens.

1768
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:07,860
Thus, now that I was a double
above the knee amputee,

1769
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:11,370
I needed to figure out a way
to keep my life enjoyable.

1770
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:16,530
With this in mind, I researched the
Paralympics to see if I could participate,

1771
01:55:16,531 --> 01:55:20,490
which led to a bronze medal at
the 2012 games. Not only that,

1772
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,640
I accepted people into my life who
have enriched it beyond what I could've

1773
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:28,790
imagined from the experiences
associated with sports.

1774
01:55:28,791 --> 01:55:32,900
I've learned lessons that have and will
continue to make me a better person.

1775
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:36,590
Lessons that I can pass on
to others in the future.

1776
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:43,560
It was in this way that I was able to
transform the negative experience of

1777
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:48,561
having lost the lower part of my legs
into the positive experience in energy of

1778
01:55:48,691 --> 01:55:52,050
participating in a sport and
all that has accompanied it.

1779
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:53,900
Okay.

1780
01:55:53,900 --> 01:55:55,910
If you are ill or injured,

1781
01:55:56,150 --> 01:56:00,230
use it as a way to discover
a new hobby or career.

1782
01:56:01,710 --> 01:56:04,440
If someone is rude to
you and makes you angry.

1783
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:05,760
Yeah,

1784
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,860
use the anger to fuel a workout.

1785
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:11,510
If someone you know
has a terminal illness,

1786
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:16,960
use it as an opportunity to make a
difference in their life and in the world.

1787
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:23,460
The most important part of transforming
energy from negative to positive is

1788
01:56:23,461 --> 01:56:28,290
being aware of opportunities as they
are presented and having the courage to

1789
01:56:28,291 --> 01:56:33,210
seize them.
Energy is all around us.

1790
01:56:33,390 --> 01:56:36,030
Constantly fueling and transforming.

1791
01:56:37,420 --> 01:56:41,230
It will affect us in ways we
cannot beat per, we cannot predict

1792
01:56:42,890 --> 01:56:46,460
be a person that uses
energy intelligently.

1793
01:56:47,350 --> 01:56:47,510
Okay.

1794
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:48,620
Instead of wasting it.

1795
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:58,000
I like to say you use the weight
and I kind of analogize it.

1796
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:01,270
I like to lift weights. Sure.
You guys can probably tell,

1797
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:07,150
I like to analogize it with
maybe like a strict press.

1798
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:10,210
So the weight on the bar,

1799
01:57:10,630 --> 01:57:13,440
his whatever girlfriend broke up with you,

1800
01:57:13,450 --> 01:57:16,600
whatever possible issue you're having.

1801
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:22,480
And you can hold that bar
on your shoulders and you
can just leave it there and

1802
01:57:22,481 --> 01:57:24,370
eventually start to hurt.

1803
01:57:25,540 --> 01:57:28,420
And then eventually if you
leave it there long enough,

1804
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:31,870
you'll just be on the ground
with that weight on your chest.

1805
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:33,130
You can't move anymore.

1806
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:38,050
Or when you have that weight on
the bar and it's on your shoulders,

1807
01:57:38,890 --> 01:57:42,550
your shoulder, press it
and then do it again.

1808
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,430
You'd do it again and again.

1809
01:57:46,030 --> 01:57:50,560
And then you let your body adapt and
next time you try and lift that weight,

1810
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:54,640
it's nothing you can do that wait
easily, I can handle that, no problem.

1811
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:59,980
And then you can handle even more weight.
And then when you get good at that,

1812
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:03,310
you seek out the weight.

1813
01:58:04,450 --> 01:58:09,450
You purposefully try and make things
harder for yourself so that you can just

1814
01:58:09,881 --> 01:58:12,340
become even stronger and even stronger.

1815
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,710
And you embrace that and you start
to enjoy it a little bit. And so,

1816
01:58:18,240 --> 01:58:20,420
I mean, I think that's what
I was trying to say there.

1817
01:58:21,650 --> 01:58:25,180
I think you said it. Not
only did you say it, but, uh,

1818
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:31,300
you actually are living that currently
at this time seeking out more.

1819
01:58:34,080 --> 01:58:34,913
Uh,

1820
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:38,380
I guess maybe I would even go so
far as to say stupid things to do.

1821
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:42,160
So the next

1822
01:58:42,160 --> 01:58:45,550
challenge that you put in
front of yourself is the
thing that you're about to do

1823
01:58:45,551 --> 01:58:49,030
right now. And I've never heard
of a challenge like this before,

1824
01:58:49,031 --> 01:58:52,180
but you're going to do
a month of marathons.

1825
01:58:52,610 --> 01:58:56,750
Yeah.
So these things are only stupid or crazy

1826
01:58:59,010 --> 01:59:01,150
rides.
Not Crazy because I did it.

1827
01:59:02,930 --> 01:59:05,690
If I had failed, then people could
say it's crazy, so I failed this one,

1828
01:59:05,691 --> 01:59:07,610
then it's stupid.
Um,

1829
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:10,110
Nah, man, I'll tell you why did you,

1830
01:59:10,111 --> 01:59:13,720
you going out there and making
these things happen. You know, it's,

1831
01:59:13,721 --> 01:59:16,810
it's awesome whether you finish or
not. Well, no matter what you do,

1832
01:59:16,811 --> 01:59:20,830
the fact that you're putting
these hardcore challenges
in front of yourself is,

1833
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:22,900
it's unbelievable.
Yeah.

1834
01:59:23,310 --> 01:59:28,150
So, yeah, all this stuff that I've
written down, what we've talked about,

1835
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:30,100
all the wisdom I've been able to,

1836
01:59:30,350 --> 01:59:33,130
to gain through my injury and
through being in the Marine Corps.

1837
01:59:33,940 --> 01:59:38,470
I think this the month of marathons I'm
about to do this and everything else

1838
01:59:38,471 --> 01:59:39,970
that I,
that I try and do.

1839
01:59:39,971 --> 01:59:44,971
I'm trying to be an example because
there's so many people out there.

1840
01:59:45,380 --> 01:59:47,620
When I was trying to learn
to ride the bike again,

1841
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:53,830
I didn't know anybody that had ever done
it before until I saw somebody that had

1842
01:59:53,831 --> 01:59:58,480
done it and it just made everything.
Once you realize it's possible,

1843
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:03,490
it makes it so much easier because
you know it's, it can be done.

1844
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:05,373
And so

1845
02:00:07,090 --> 02:00:11,440
I want to be an example for people to
look at and they see me and they say,

1846
02:00:11,441 --> 02:00:12,274
well,

1847
02:00:13,600 --> 02:00:18,130
they might not be trying
to run 31 marathons in 31
days and 31 different cities

1848
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:22,300
or ride their bike across the country.
But they can say

1849
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:29,130
there's a double above knee amputee
that ran 31 marathons in 31 days.

1850
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:33,700
I can probably go walk on the treadmill.

1851
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:40,320
So if I just want to be an example of
that and I want to be an example of all of

1852
02:00:40,841 --> 02:00:42,970
these lessons that I've learned,

1853
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:47,410
a person that uses the weight instead
of lets it destroy their life,

1854
02:00:47,890 --> 02:00:50,620
somebody that stays in the fight
keeps fighting no matter what.

1855
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,360
That's what I'm trying to do.

1856
02:00:52,361 --> 02:00:57,361
I want to serve to show people
what they can do and especially,

1857
02:00:58,631 --> 02:00:58,901
you know,

1858
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:02,890
wounded veterans and people that might
be struggling with what they saw.

1859
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:04,211
And you know,

1860
02:01:04,211 --> 02:01:09,070
I'm lucky enough that my mind is clear.

1861
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:13,000
I had a great three concussion.
That's it. No traumatic brain injury,

1862
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:15,370
no post traumatic stress,
nothing like that.

1863
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:21,150
And so I want to show
civilians and veterans like
that it is possible to have a

1864
02:01:22,871 --> 02:01:27,871
traumatic experience and come
through and be fine and not have,

1865
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:34,390
not have to suffer from post traumatic
stress that just overwhelms you.

1866
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:36,463
Um,

1867
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:41,810
cause I think in society these days it's
almost becoming expected that you're

1868
02:01:41,811 --> 02:01:45,290
going to go to war and you're
going to come back. And so

1869
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,590
a lot of people might
end up just being a wall.

1870
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:50,510
I'm supposed to have
post traumatic stress.

1871
02:01:50,511 --> 02:01:55,511
So I'm going to manifest it in myself
or they let it get worse or they don't,

1872
02:01:57,980 --> 02:02:00,020
they don't fight it.
They just let it happen.

1873
02:02:00,920 --> 02:02:05,920
And so I want to be an example of somebody
that uses their experience and it's

1874
02:02:07,551 --> 02:02:11,330
just goes and has this terrible
experience and you know,

1875
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:12,860
don't make a big deal about it.

1876
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:20,680
And part of you doing that is running
31 freaking marathons in 31 days.

1877
02:02:21,530 --> 02:02:24,800
Yep.
So when do you start a,

1878
02:02:24,801 --> 02:02:28,400
so I'm going to start in 31
different cities, different cities,

1879
02:02:28,810 --> 02:02:30,250
first city,
London,

1880
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:35,620
a London on October 12th and then
I'm going to fly to Philadelphia.

1881
02:02:36,910 --> 02:02:40,360
So basically the way it's going to work,
I'll run in the city,

1882
02:02:41,830 --> 02:02:46,420
probably take about the whole thing. I'll
take breaks during the, during the run.

1883
02:02:46,421 --> 02:02:50,100
So probably the whole thing will probably
take five and a half, six hours to do.

1884
02:02:52,270 --> 02:02:52,780
I'll,

1885
02:02:52,780 --> 02:02:57,780
I'll do the run on my own just like
in a park or on a trail out and backs,

1886
02:02:58,781 --> 02:03:02,440
loops. I'll do it on a 400
meter track if I have to,

1887
02:03:03,220 --> 02:03:05,110
um,
do that,

1888
02:03:06,190 --> 02:03:10,330
getting my RV drive to the next place,
spend the night there.

1889
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:14,250
We upgraded from a box truck
with the clots in the back.

1890
02:03:14,270 --> 02:03:18,050
Well the wife's going to be coming along
so she wasn't going to get all going to

1891
02:03:18,051 --> 02:03:19,030
have a crew for this.

1892
02:03:19,050 --> 02:03:22,080
So when I got my wife,
Pam is gonna be my team leader.

1893
02:03:23,990 --> 02:03:27,990
She's just doing so much stuff.
She's a team leader or the everything,

1894
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:29,640
every job that you
could possibly think of.

1895
02:03:29,641 --> 02:03:34,640
She's doing it and my mom is coming cause
he a massage therapist and she's going

1896
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,990
to give him a saws and I'm
going to have a driver,

1897
02:03:36,991 --> 02:03:38,910
not my brother this time
I think I blew him out.

1898
02:03:40,430 --> 02:03:45,240
That was the first time of I'm been to
have a driver and so we're going to all

1899
02:03:45,241 --> 02:03:49,140
hop in the RV drive too.
So from Philadelphia to New York,

1900
02:03:50,070 --> 02:03:54,570
run in New York,
repeat until I go all the way around.

1901
02:03:54,571 --> 02:03:59,571
I'm going to end November 11th
veteran's day DC on the National Mall.

1902
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:00,350
And,

1903
02:04:00,350 --> 02:04:05,350
and your goal obviously is to show people
and lead people and to set an amazing

1904
02:04:05,481 --> 02:04:09,470
example. And on top of that you're
going to earn, you're going to,

1905
02:04:09,530 --> 02:04:14,200
you're going to earn money for
some real specific charities that,

1906
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:17,930
that you believe in and stand behind.
And what are those charities?

1907
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,580
Yeah,
so my goal,

1908
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:24,610
my main goal is obviously the to be the
example and all these kind of grand uh,

1909
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:30,140
objectives. But you
know, how do you really,

1910
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:31,880
you can't quantify that really.

1911
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:37,010
So the way that I'm quantifying it is
I'm going to be raising money for three

1912
02:04:37,020 --> 02:04:40,440
veterans charities that I've had
personal contact with that have helped me

1913
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:44,790
during my recovery. Um, and
they are the semper fi fund,

1914
02:04:45,270 --> 02:04:50,270
the tunnel to towers foundation and the
coalition to salute America's heroes.

1915
02:04:51,090 --> 02:04:53,340
And so that's how I'm going to be.
That's also,

1916
02:04:53,341 --> 02:04:58,341
I'm going to be showing veterans that
America loves them because that is

1917
02:05:01,201 --> 02:05:06,150
something that's been made abundantly
clear to me. Everywhere I go.

1918
02:05:06,340 --> 02:05:07,173
Like all the time,

1919
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,800
I think I did three breakfasts in a row
where somebody paid for it anonymously.

1920
02:05:11,700 --> 02:05:15,480
I get thanked all the time.
And so if they're saying that stuff to me,

1921
02:05:15,540 --> 02:05:20,540
it's obvious that they love all veterans
and I'm trying to help connect that

1922
02:05:21,850 --> 02:05:26,850
does reduce that gap between the military
and the civilian worlds and get them

1923
02:05:28,201 --> 02:05:29,370
to,
to talk and,

1924
02:05:29,810 --> 02:05:34,110
and show that show veterans that
they're coming back to a country that

1925
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:39,111
appreciates them and loves them more
than pretty much any other thing.

1926
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:45,200
And so I think by the donations and by
having people come out and run with me

1927
02:05:46,560 --> 02:05:51,270
and show me support, then that kind
of helps us to prove that to people.

1928
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:56,880
So where can we go donate?
What's the, what's the link?

1929
02:05:57,030 --> 02:06:00,870
Rob Jones, journey.com
Rob Jones, journey.com

1930
02:06:00,970 --> 02:06:01,391
there's a,

1931
02:06:01,391 --> 02:06:06,391
there's a donate link there and you can
also see my schedule there and I'll have

1932
02:06:08,321 --> 02:06:09,670
details of where I'm going to be.

1933
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:12,550
It's the whole country. It's east coast,
west coast, Yep. Middle of the country,

1934
02:06:12,551 --> 02:06:15,690
all the way around. You can drive
in a day to get to the next spot,

1935
02:06:15,691 --> 02:06:17,190
to run 26.2 miles.

1936
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:21,600
My longest drive this 1214 hours.
And that happens maybe once or twice.

1937
02:06:21,630 --> 02:06:25,890
So it's they're all pretty close to
each other and major cities and yeah,

1938
02:06:25,891 --> 02:06:29,790
you can go to my website, Rob
Jones, journey.com donate there,

1939
02:06:30,150 --> 02:06:34,140
see my schedule Rsvp that you're going
to show up. You don't have to if you,

1940
02:06:34,141 --> 02:06:35,910
but if you want to that's cool.

1941
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:41,240
I'll have all the details there and
then social media's all at Rob Jones

1942
02:06:41,881 --> 02:06:42,714
journey.

1943
02:06:43,180 --> 02:06:44,930
Awesome.
I,

1944
02:06:47,140 --> 02:06:47,730
yeah,

1945
02:06:47,730 --> 02:06:50,610
it's awesome man. It's just awesome
and you're freaking awesome.

1946
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:55,770
And I grabbed a couple this a little
short piece from your journal.

1947
02:06:56,030 --> 02:06:59,560
Again,
this is something that I just thought is,

1948
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:04,380
is just going to be helpful to me when
I read it and will be helpful to anybody

1949
02:07:04,381 --> 02:07:08,880
that that listens,
hears or reads this and here we go.

1950
02:07:08,881 --> 02:07:09,870
Back to your journal.

1951
02:07:11,900 --> 02:07:16,700
The conscious is in
control of forming habits.

1952
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:21,190
Every time we are faced with
the decision of whether to quit,

1953
02:07:21,250 --> 02:07:26,250
slowed down and rationalize a reason why
that's okay or keep pressing forward,

1954
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:32,440
one of those habits is strengthened.

1955
02:07:33,890 --> 02:07:36,010
The more times we choose

1956
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,900
to push on,
the stronger that habit will become.

1957
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:48,520
It takes time and purposeful effort
for these habits to become ingrained.

1958
02:07:48,670 --> 02:07:51,520
But once a person
develops them in the gym,

1959
02:07:51,521 --> 02:07:56,230
doing something as simple as choosing
to keep rowing hard for another minute,

1960
02:07:58,090 --> 02:08:01,780
they can apply what they have
learned to the rest of their lives.

1961
02:08:03,020 --> 02:08:03,660
Yeah.

1962
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:08,130
They will learn to take the harder
path so that they are challenged more.

1963
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:14,410
They will learn to put extra
effort into daily tasks.

1964
02:08:16,570 --> 02:08:21,570
Who you are depends entirely on your
influences and the level of effort that is

1965
02:08:27,371 --> 02:08:32,371
put into forging yourself
into what you desire to be.

1966
02:08:39,550 --> 02:08:42,380
And that's awesome. Yeah. I mean, every,

1967
02:08:42,470 --> 02:08:47,470
every decision you make either gets you
closer to your goal or moves you further

1968
02:08:47,871 --> 02:08:48,704
away.

1969
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:53,060
And I'm not saying I'd never make
the decisions that movie to the left,

1970
02:08:53,300 --> 02:08:56,210
maybe further away.
I'm human just like everybody else.

1971
02:08:56,500 --> 02:09:00,760
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. You know,

1972
02:09:00,890 --> 02:09:03,730
we were hanging out yesterday and I was
like, I was busy. I was like, Hey man,

1973
02:09:03,731 --> 02:09:08,050
I've got to go. So in that buisiness you
know what I had for dinner last night,

1974
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:12,190
Mrs? No, I did have Mras
that's not happening. Okay. No.

1975
02:09:12,220 --> 02:09:17,220
My entire dinner was a leftover piece
of a Caesar Salad and a giant mint

1976
02:09:19,031 --> 02:09:20,060
chocolate chip milkshake.

1977
02:09:23,230 --> 02:09:27,830
I actually said, my wife is like make me,
cause I was working and I did. You know,

1978
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:31,210
you can't stop and eat when you're
trying to work and so I just said,

1979
02:09:31,211 --> 02:09:35,920
can you make me just a giant mint
chocolate chip milkshake now?

1980
02:09:35,921 --> 02:09:39,990
I didn't get closer to my,
you know, physical goals. No,

1981
02:09:40,270 --> 02:09:42,640
but I got a lot of work done.
Yeah, I got an extra whatever,

1982
02:09:42,641 --> 02:09:46,540
28 minutes worth of work though because
I didn't stop to eat dinner. Yeah, yeah.

1983
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:48,760
You got to take the wins with the losses.
I dig it,

1984
02:09:49,670 --> 02:09:51,890
Isabelle. You know, making that,

1985
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:58,380
it's like you plot your progress
on a graph and you're going to have

1986
02:10:00,510 --> 02:10:02,790
as long it's going to go up and
it's going to go down a little bit,

1987
02:10:02,791 --> 02:10:04,020
then it's going to go up
and it's going to be down.

1988
02:10:04,021 --> 02:10:08,050
So as long as that trend is upward,
then you know you can relate to,

1989
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:09,150
have nothing to worry about.

1990
02:10:09,151 --> 02:10:12,330
But if that thing starts to level
off and then go the other way,

1991
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:15,270
then you need to ask yourself
some questions and you
need to give yourself some

1992
02:10:15,271 --> 02:10:16,104
honest answers.

1993
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:18,600
Yeah. You know, we had a
conversation not too long ago,

1994
02:10:18,860 --> 02:10:22,740
a guy asked about Jujitsu belts and said,
you know,

1995
02:10:23,670 --> 02:10:26,070
I understand that you shouldn't pursue
cause in Jiu Jitsu it's like, hey,

1996
02:10:26,071 --> 02:10:28,950
you shouldn't just like go to get a belt.
Uh,

1997
02:10:29,190 --> 02:10:34,070
you go cause you want to get better and
you want to learn. And, and he said,

1998
02:10:34,070 --> 02:10:36,320
you know, I understand that you
shouldn't just do it to get the belt,

1999
02:10:37,090 --> 02:10:37,923
but

2000
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:40,910
it's good to mark your progress
and figure your progress out.

2001
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:46,190
And I was it. And that's true. And
that's what you're saying like, yeah.

2002
02:10:46,191 --> 02:10:48,980
And I've talked about
that too. Um, you know,

2003
02:10:48,981 --> 02:10:53,540
I related to shooting where when you,
when you focus on the target,

2004
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:57,870
your, your vision gets blurry and
so you lose track of the long term,

2005
02:10:58,370 --> 02:11:01,220
the long term goal or
the long range target.

2006
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:04,430
So that's why we focused on our front
site because we can keep that little thing

2007
02:11:04,431 --> 02:11:07,190
that's right in front three feet
in front of us on our rifle.

2008
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:09,650
You can keep that in focus.
So that's what you focus on.

2009
02:11:09,860 --> 02:11:13,880
And every once in a while if you start
that, maybe that gets a little blurry.

2010
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:15,830
Well then you look at your
longterm targeting cause the,

2011
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:19,790
that daily grind will beat you down too.
And if you just lift the daily grind,

2012
02:11:19,791 --> 02:11:23,450
the daily grind, the daily grind
beating you down, and then you, you,

2013
02:11:23,470 --> 02:11:27,260
you forget what your goal was in the
first place. But so every once in a while,

2014
02:11:27,261 --> 02:11:29,090
yeah, you've got to look up
at your longterm goal and say,

2015
02:11:29,091 --> 02:11:33,740
I want to be doing this or achieve that
or whatever. I want to do 31 marathons.

2016
02:11:34,540 --> 02:11:38,600
See some people would have
picked like February, right?

2017
02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:43,550
We'll do 28 marathons. You're,
you're going to the full 31.

2018
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:46,010
Uh,
that's the difference right there.

2019
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:49,370
If I want to make it,
if I want to make these points,

2020
02:11:50,120 --> 02:11:53,990
that's why I rode my bike from
Maine to southern California.

2021
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:57,200
I was sitting there going, yeah, I could,

2022
02:11:57,890 --> 02:12:02,600
I could ride Florida to San
Diego. It would be technically
be all the way across,

2023
02:12:03,380 --> 02:12:05,720
but technically,
but there'd be that.

2024
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:10,280
But I don't want any buts
associated with anything that I do.

2025
02:12:10,310 --> 02:12:14,740
I don't want anybody to have any
reason to say, Oh yeah, Rob Jones,

2026
02:12:14,741 --> 02:12:16,730
he ran 31 marathons in 31 days,

2027
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:22,350
not 32. Did you got to do a good job
on, on your social media when you're,

2028
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:23,340
when you go out on this thing,

2029
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:26,010
you got to document this thing
and post it so people can like,

2030
02:12:26,620 --> 02:12:31,620
I'm hoping so I'm working
with a sports illustrated.

2031
02:12:32,230 --> 02:12:36,260
I think they're going to do a video. I
heard of them. Um, yeah, good outlet.

2032
02:12:38,040 --> 02:12:39,100
Do they do good videos?

2033
02:12:41,130 --> 02:12:46,030
That's to discriminating judge
of videos. Right. So yeah,

2034
02:12:46,031 --> 02:12:47,200
I plan like,
you know,

2035
02:12:47,201 --> 02:12:52,090
I documented the a bike ride that's
documentaries on my website too. So yeah,

2036
02:12:52,091 --> 02:12:54,340
I do try and document these things and uh,

2037
02:12:54,520 --> 02:12:57,430
just in case people don't happen
to catch it while I'm doing it,

2038
02:12:57,431 --> 02:13:02,140
they can go back and use that as
their example for, for what I've done.

2039
02:13:02,141 --> 02:13:04,160
And they can find out that way.
Yeah.

2040
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:09,770
Well I know you get stuff done and
you hammer out your daily tasks.

2041
02:13:11,850 --> 02:13:14,160
We're going to let echo hammer
out his baby task right now.

2042
02:13:15,300 --> 02:13:19,410
Technically we porch
time, we can task. I do,

2043
02:13:19,411 --> 02:13:23,100
I extra respect on the
weightlifting analogy.

2044
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:25,980
I think like weight lifting
and exercising in general,

2045
02:13:25,981 --> 02:13:28,980
like Chris is like the perfect
analogy for those things. You know,

2046
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:33,600
cause it's like, yeah, I mean I could
into it, but yeah, it was good. But that,

2047
02:13:33,601 --> 02:13:37,800
that is an APP,
that outstanding analogy like,

2048
02:13:37,801 --> 02:13:38,860
hey that waits on you.

2049
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:42,030
You're either going to use it to get
better or are you going to let it bare you

2050
02:13:42,031 --> 02:13:44,580
in the ground? Yeah. The choice is
yours. What are you going to do?

2051
02:13:45,060 --> 02:13:47,510
Yeah. And like, and it goes to show,

2052
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:52,380
we talk about this sometimes where you
can take let's say a random person, right?

2053
02:13:52,620 --> 02:13:55,580
And you'd be like, Hey, let's
go to the gym. And there,

2054
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,860
there can be literally opposite reactions
if you get two different people.

2055
02:13:58,861 --> 02:14:02,460
So one guy, you can be like,
hell yeah, let's go to the
gym. I'm going to work out.

2056
02:14:02,461 --> 02:14:04,980
And it gets dry, need to get in shape.
Good. You know, it's this thing.

2057
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:07,980
Or he can get someone to be like,
that's the worst thing in the world.

2058
02:14:07,981 --> 02:14:10,280
I don't want to go to the gym.
I don't like,

2059
02:14:10,350 --> 02:14:13,500
that's hard and it hurts the
next day it hurts, you know?

2060
02:14:13,501 --> 02:14:17,020
So meanwhile it's the same exact
activity by the way, you know?

2061
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,290
So you can look at in
those two different ways,

2062
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:20,541
you know,

2063
02:14:20,541 --> 02:14:25,541
what else is messed up is
there's activities that are
also good for you and move

2064
02:14:28,281 --> 02:14:32,570
you in a direction that you want
to be moving. But maybe like,

2065
02:14:32,571 --> 02:14:35,780
let's say the got, you can, we
can give you a real good example.

2066
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:40,040
You take a meat head,
right? And you go, okay,

2067
02:14:40,970 --> 02:14:45,440
you want to go to the gym? What does
the meat head say? Yes, let's go get it.

2068
02:14:46,190 --> 02:14:49,520
But then you say to that same guy who
seems all motivated and fired up to

2069
02:14:49,521 --> 02:14:52,250
improve himself. Yeah. And you say, Hey,

2070
02:14:53,690 --> 02:14:58,690
let's go read a book and
try and understand better
this concept of whatever and

2071
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:07,340
what did they say? Then
they go to the gym. So it's
interesting. Yeah. The weight,

2072
02:15:07,370 --> 02:15:11,960
the weight isn't necessarily
just a physical weight,

2073
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:16,700
it's pressing up against whatever it is
that's going to improve you and you can

2074
02:15:16,701 --> 02:15:20,720
either use it to beat you down or you
can use it to make yourself better.

2075
02:15:20,810 --> 02:15:24,620
Yeah. And again, just as a concept, right?

2076
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:28,400
I think the exercise and weightlifting
and like your body just kind of

2077
02:15:28,970 --> 02:15:32,810
figuratively can demonstrate just so
much, you know, that'll place so much

2078
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,640
and you especially feel that way
about curls. Is that what I'm hearing?

2079
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:39,450
Depends on the thing, but yeah, generally.

2080
02:15:40,940 --> 02:15:43,880
Anyway,
speaking of curls,

2081
02:15:46,070 --> 02:15:47,560
which should I go into this?
No.

2082
02:15:48,780 --> 02:15:52,950
Your daily tasks. Weekly tasks,
yeah. Yeah. Might as well. Well,

2083
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:58,230
Rob Jones here to listen so, and then
wait to hear the support, the support

2084
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:04,890
you get to witness the supports live
honor. So Watch, watch echo, do his work.

2085
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:08,700
His life's work. His life's work right
here. Support. You have to do this.

2086
02:16:08,701 --> 02:16:13,290
We can go to my house and you watch me
edit a video. So, so dope. You know?

2087
02:16:14,630 --> 02:16:15,463
Anyway.

2088
02:16:17,990 --> 02:16:20,510
Made in America or Gin,

2089
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:25,460
that's the company or didn't
main.com you started in Maine. Yeah.

2090
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:27,620
By credit cross city. Yeah.
That's where this place is.

2091
02:16:27,621 --> 02:16:32,050
We just got back what last week?
Yeah. We can ask whatever. Yeah,

2092
02:16:32,051 --> 02:16:35,140
that's a cool spot.
You know he has a side note.

2093
02:16:35,170 --> 02:16:38,650
He is like this I think is on like the
history channel or something like that

2094
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:41,560
where it was kind of like a show and you
know the story you told about getting,

2095
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:45,420
he got this, the loom right where he
got to actually make right, right.

2096
02:16:45,421 --> 02:16:47,980
They came and filmed some stuff
but they can produce it. Yeah.

2097
02:16:47,981 --> 02:16:50,710
He showed it to me but it
was great because when he's
telling the story I'm like

2098
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:54,300
man that took you took like eight
hours or something or more than two.

2099
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:55,121
More than that.
Yeah.

2100
02:16:55,121 --> 02:16:57,820
I like to get it and it's this big
thing and it kind of showed it.

2101
02:16:57,850 --> 02:17:01,120
They were there for that
bill moving the looms.

2102
02:17:02,540 --> 02:17:07,040
Loomis and me neither and
that he asked me, he's like,

2103
02:17:07,041 --> 02:17:08,590
you know what illumines I was like loom.

2104
02:17:08,591 --> 02:17:12,880
I've heard that like Warren was
familiar fruit of the loom. Right? Yeah.

2105
02:17:13,210 --> 02:17:16,780
And when you think about it, it makes
sense because fruit of the loom is like,

2106
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:20,470
right. It's the fabric, you know, it
has all the strings, right? Yeah, yeah.

2107
02:17:20,471 --> 02:17:24,100
It makes fabric anyway.
So when they say made in America,

2108
02:17:24,101 --> 02:17:27,820
in this case it's for real made in
America. They get to cotton from America,

2109
02:17:27,910 --> 02:17:31,170
they make it with a loom in America.

2110
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:35,500
This guy p Roberts up in origin,
which were in league now with origin,

2111
02:17:35,980 --> 02:17:40,330
but we went up into old mills
cause all the mills up there,

2112
02:17:40,370 --> 02:17:44,320
a lot of them shut down. And actually
I think all of them shut down.

2113
02:17:44,650 --> 02:17:45,850
And these were,
these were,

2114
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:51,090
these were factories that were like
half a million square feet and they were

2115
02:17:51,671 --> 02:17:55,360
filled with looms and filled with
production and filled with a war.

2116
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:56,470
American workers.

2117
02:17:56,800 --> 02:18:01,800
And it all went overseas and he
went in and literally bought Allume.

2118
02:18:04,010 --> 02:18:08,080
Um, for that, I think that,
I think it was like $3,000,

2119
02:18:08,650 --> 02:18:11,830
the cost of the scrap metal that
it was worth and anyways, took it,

2120
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:15,040
hired some old timers that new,
still knew how to work.

2121
02:18:15,041 --> 02:18:18,940
It brought them back to work
and then started making clothes.

2122
02:18:19,590 --> 02:18:22,900
Well making Jujitsu gies where he
started with but, but you know,

2123
02:18:22,960 --> 02:18:25,450
got everything being lined up to get made.
And that loom,

2124
02:18:25,451 --> 02:18:29,470
they only had that one because they're
going to put in a museum or something.

2125
02:18:29,530 --> 02:18:29,741
Yeah.

2126
02:18:29,741 --> 02:18:32,980
They were literally going to take that
one loom that they had left and they're

2127
02:18:32,981 --> 02:18:35,490
going to make it a museum over on it

2128
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:40,780
some because there are so many people
out there now that they're like,

2129
02:18:40,810 --> 02:18:43,750
oh our country has to make problems,
our country has to may problems.

2130
02:18:43,751 --> 02:18:45,160
We need to do this,
we need to do that.

2131
02:18:45,970 --> 02:18:49,940
And are they say somebody is to do this,
somebody needs to.

2132
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:54,820
And it's like, Hey, yeah, why want you
and here's the guy that's doing that.

2133
02:18:55,370 --> 02:18:57,690
No, it's all guess what bull. Yeah. Yeah.

2134
02:18:58,320 --> 02:19:02,250
And it's interesting too
when we went there, you can
tell he's into it. He's like,

2135
02:19:02,251 --> 02:19:05,460
he were driving up there, he's talking
about how yarn is all made and stuff.

2136
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:08,920
And he's like, Hey, I got, I got to
calm down because I'm getting to,

2137
02:19:10,710 --> 02:19:15,590
I need to say he's into it. Cause he went
out and bought a broken rusty Lubrin,

2138
02:19:15,630 --> 02:19:18,900
refurbished it and moved it into a
factory that he built on his own property.

2139
02:19:18,901 --> 02:19:19,740
It's ridiculous.

2140
02:19:20,310 --> 02:19:24,750
And it shows to the gies like
you might do Jujitsu right today.

2141
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:28,790
Piggies are like, they're cool, you
know, martial arts, Giza, whatever.

2142
02:19:28,791 --> 02:19:32,690
But he brings like this added like
element to it because it's specifically

2143
02:19:32,691 --> 02:19:36,080
designed for, yeah, for Jujitsu. That's
not the kind where it's like, Hey,

2144
02:19:36,081 --> 02:19:41,081
let me get a g blank from overseas or
whatever and then like embroider my logo

2145
02:19:41,361 --> 02:19:43,280
on it. So it's kind of like
the same thing. You don't,

2146
02:19:43,310 --> 02:19:47,760
you don't have much innovation freedom
with a physical product. He does though.

2147
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:51,130
So it's like I took all his
role and the other day GE,

2148
02:19:51,690 --> 02:19:55,520
whenever I take off the top and
you'd left with just the pants.

2149
02:19:55,550 --> 02:19:58,310
So the pants are like,
they're by, um, like sizes.

2150
02:19:58,311 --> 02:20:03,020
You know you wear a 36 are in regular
stuff is just the like numbers a one,

2151
02:20:03,021 --> 02:20:06,640
a two, a three, four, five, six.
This is like fitted to you. Right.

2152
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:11,060
So I'm wearing the pants and they feel
kind of like normal pants and I was Greg

2153
02:20:11,061 --> 02:20:13,640
in one. They're like, they were noticing.

2154
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:20,770
You always don't mind getting
choked out by [inaudible]. So sweet.

2155
02:20:20,771 --> 02:20:24,200
Here's the thing. My streak everyday and
I wear it everyday. I've to two tops.

2156
02:20:24,920 --> 02:20:29,000
I wear it every day and the streak is
still alive every single time someone asks

2157
02:20:29,001 --> 02:20:32,460
like what up the key and they call, let
me see, let me see. Yeah, they're dope.

2158
02:20:33,010 --> 02:20:36,270
Fabric is woven is legit.
This is legit. Yeah.

2159
02:20:36,500 --> 02:20:39,560
And see these shorts I have on right
now, I should, I kind of in a way,

2160
02:20:39,561 --> 02:20:41,600
should it mention these
cars be sticking out.

2161
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:43,490
We're not making those shorts
because they don't make these shorts.

2162
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:49,410
I've worn these three days in a row by the
way. Oh, nice. That smell was whatever.

2163
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:52,790
I watched the ones, but yeah,
they're my favorite shorts.

2164
02:20:52,791 --> 02:20:55,430
They're made out of the same material
as one of the one of the keys. Yeah,

2165
02:20:55,431 --> 02:20:59,550
that looks nice. Yeah. I spilled some
eggs on it. You know, it leaves them,

2166
02:20:59,570 --> 02:21:01,700
these shorts are black by,
so you know how you,

2167
02:21:01,701 --> 02:21:05,330
when you spill eggs or out of nausea feed
my son yogurt and stuff and it's built

2168
02:21:05,331 --> 02:21:06,164
on it.

2169
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:10,100
So you just take a brush like you know
like a brush you find under your sink or

2170
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:13,760
whatever. Put some water and I scrubbed
it. You can't do that on like your shorts,

2171
02:21:13,790 --> 02:21:16,640
cattle start to wear it out,
you know. But it gets tough.

2172
02:21:16,641 --> 02:21:21,170
It's supposed to be tough. Did
it? You'd have to wash it anyway.

2173
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:24,350
I can't get the shorts. I don't get
robbed and fire it up. We'll make it,

2174
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:27,650
we'll make them. Yeah. So
stand by for that nonetheless.

2175
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:31,000
Do ciggies all kinds of the
rash guards and even like,

2176
02:21:31,820 --> 02:21:35,930
like regular clothes,
shirts, hoodies and whatnot.

2177
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:39,410
The joggers acute putting on the joggers
and walking around in front of my wife,

2178
02:21:39,411 --> 02:21:42,530
she likes it. That was a weird thing
cause I didn't actually know what,

2179
02:21:42,920 --> 02:21:45,740
do you know what joggers are there?
New joggers, you know, they're like,

2180
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:49,110
there are like, what's a
passion thing? No sweat pants,

2181
02:21:49,130 --> 02:21:53,780
but they're somehow more high
end. Yeah, the shape is different.

2182
02:21:53,781 --> 02:21:57,980
They kind of taper down your leg. Like,
you know, I like skinny jeans and said

2183
02:22:01,050 --> 02:22:05,240
I'm going to go ahead and say I don't
endorse that product. Neither did I,

2184
02:22:05,241 --> 02:22:08,720
but I put them on and I was like,
I was like these,

2185
02:22:08,721 --> 02:22:10,910
I don't know how I look because they
didn't have a mirror in the cabin

2186
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:17,510
except in the bathroom. But nonetheless,
um, so I couldn't see how they look.

2187
02:22:17,511 --> 02:22:20,630
They look kind of strange from up here,
but I don't know. So I was like, Eh,

2188
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:22,500
whatever origin he wore,

2189
02:22:22,520 --> 02:22:27,330
the origin jogger pants and the matching
origin, the sweatshirt or Hoodie.

2190
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:30,270
And he went, he rolled out
like that. Like it was like,

2191
02:22:30,271 --> 02:22:34,830
it was the deal and he looked, he was a
straight up leisure suit is what it is.

2192
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:37,230
Rolling up,
not playing around.

2193
02:22:37,410 --> 02:22:41,220
And then when I came in I
thought people would be like, oh,

2194
02:22:41,221 --> 02:22:44,730
you know you don't match in that cause
I'm not used to wearing but B if that I

2195
02:22:44,731 --> 02:22:48,890
that I looked good in it and then my wife
said I looked good in it. Oh that one

2196
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:52,350
Pete made it.
Of course

2197
02:22:54,550 --> 02:22:58,050
he was a moment of honesty because
he mentioned either you, I don't,

2198
02:22:58,060 --> 02:23:00,120
I think it was you or someone.
He was like,

2199
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:03,840
I don't think just Jocko could pull
it off or something like that. No,

2200
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:05,850
it might've been someone else. I don't
think he was talking about he's right.

2201
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:09,310
He's away.
Pull it off.

2202
02:23:10,610 --> 02:23:14,270
Whatever coes design for
what I did notice though,

2203
02:23:14,271 --> 02:23:18,780
not happening there.
I'm maybe I'm not secure in my man had no,

2204
02:23:18,781 --> 02:23:23,640
I just know for girls clothes,
rarely, not nonetheless.

2205
02:23:23,641 --> 02:23:26,370
Functionally. That is what I noticed
right when I put them on though,

2206
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:28,260
like when you roll out,
you know how like if you have,

2207
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:30,000
and not that it's even a big deal.

2208
02:23:30,001 --> 02:23:35,001
Even me talking about things like you
know how it is when like something

2209
02:23:35,491 --> 02:23:39,540
happens. But actually when
you wearing skinny jeans,

2210
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,690
I actually have no idea
what he's talking about.

2211
02:23:42,691 --> 02:23:46,440
But I roll with it cause we're trying to
condense the timeline of the supports.

2212
02:23:46,530 --> 02:23:50,220
Speech speaking,
which is hard in the spirit of accuracy.

2213
02:23:50,370 --> 02:23:53,430
I'm going to go down this
whole, you know, when you were,

2214
02:23:53,431 --> 02:23:56,630
have you ever worn sweat pants ever in
your life? Not really. Kind of sweatpants.

2215
02:23:56,670 --> 02:24:01,560
Okay. Rob Jones. I have
warrants pre-injury IIF. Yeah.
So consider this. When you,

2216
02:24:01,590 --> 02:24:03,660
let's say like, I don't know, you're
running or walking or whatever.

2217
02:24:03,670 --> 02:24:07,800
He's like the sweatpants or you loose.
They flow. Not a big deal. I dig it.

2218
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:12,030
I understand. But the
skinny jeans, sweatpants,

2219
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:13,680
joggers,
I,

2220
02:24:13,681 --> 02:24:18,681
we shouldn't even say skinny jeans are
going to get this off my podcast now they

2221
02:24:19,111 --> 02:24:21,540
function cause they don't
flap around and they're like,

2222
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:26,130
if you're running with them, they
work. I'm just finally shorts.

2223
02:24:26,580 --> 02:24:30,300
Right for that very reason. It's three
feet of snow. I just run in short. It

2224
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:35,670
nonetheless built,
knock it till you try it all.

2225
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:40,140
So Jocko, some supplements, I don't
know if you knew this, Rob Jones,

2226
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:44,400
but super krill oil
available now available boom,

2227
02:24:44,430 --> 02:24:47,880
or domain.com or [inaudible] the top labs

2228
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:53,040
labs on the top of the menu.
What do you call it?

2229
02:24:53,041 --> 02:24:58,020
The top menu on the website labs.
Super Krill joint warfare.

2230
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:04,020
That's a big one. I mean we know Krill is
like the base, the joint warfare. Yeah.

2231
02:25:04,170 --> 02:25:07,680
So good. And the significance. Well
layers if you will. I think, you know,

2232
02:25:07,681 --> 02:25:09,920
maybe that's a stretch with layers,
but this is the,

2233
02:25:09,921 --> 02:25:14,921
the stuff that you've been taking from
jump as with some bonus bonus stuff,

2234
02:25:17,940 --> 02:25:21,000
bonus stuff that I now
can take in one shot.

2235
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:24,310
So like when you're even
before this podcast and stuff,

2236
02:25:24,311 --> 02:25:27,430
you're like taking glucosamine and Krill
oil and all this stuff and you're like,

2237
02:25:27,431 --> 02:25:30,040
you know what would be make this
even better. It's like, you know,

2238
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:34,930
those little elements or
whatever. And one day, you know,

2239
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:39,400
I'm going to make my own and boom, it
happened kind of. Yeah. So we're in it.

2240
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,640
A joint warfare. That's a
good one. A Super Krill.

2241
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:47,590
Describe it has an added thing right in
the Super Krill oil and it's like Super

2242
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:51,220
Krill. Yeah, yeah. Oh that's it.
Super Supergirl. Dope Krill. Okay.

2243
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:55,540
What else is going to add?
It's already super duper

2244
02:25:57,250 --> 02:25:59,920
duper.
That'll be super duper all calling us.

2245
02:25:59,940 --> 02:26:02,980
He now he's going to take the
market from us. Rob Jones,

2246
02:26:02,981 --> 02:26:05,540
super duper Krill oil to just pat it.

2247
02:26:07,260 --> 02:26:10,060
Well he does make things have just gotten
the website and that Twitter handle

2248
02:26:10,250 --> 02:26:13,540
the domain. It's true. Uh, but yeah,

2249
02:26:13,570 --> 02:26:16,930
so basically everything you need for
the joint situation, you're covered.

2250
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:19,760
And then what about that pre work?

2251
02:26:19,770 --> 02:26:24,760
A preadmission preadmission pre pre
workout. It's not available yet.

2252
02:26:25,290 --> 02:26:29,560
It will be coming soon. It's, we're
not going to talk about that one.

2253
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:31,330
We'll talk about it. We are, it is,

2254
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:36,810
is in the testing phase and has
been being tested and legit so far.

2255
02:26:38,891 --> 02:26:42,040
So good. Boom. I'm kind
of addicted to it. Yep.

2256
02:26:42,730 --> 02:26:47,290
Also on it.com/jocko.
Okay.

2257
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:49,820
So I get all my kettle bells from on.

2258
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:54,820
I got into kettle bells after this
podcast kind of started. And you know,

2259
02:26:54,821 --> 02:26:56,560
ana has awesome stuff.

2260
02:26:57,970 --> 02:27:00,220
Specifically the kettlebells
because they're the designer.

2261
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:04,000
Once you seen that guy before it.
So I get the whole set.

2262
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:05,200
Well I don't have the whole set.

2263
02:27:05,260 --> 02:27:08,500
Technically I have the weights that
I think I'm going to be able to use.

2264
02:27:08,501 --> 02:27:11,500
What's your heaviest one you
have at home? Uh, 40 kilograms.

2265
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:16,690
So what does that 80, 80, 88 pounds.

2266
02:27:17,770 --> 02:27:21,040
That's cool man. Cool story. I
got the 90 pound one, so whatever.

2267
02:27:21,041 --> 02:27:25,270
So basically all 88 pounds that you have.
I have that plus more and more.

2268
02:27:25,720 --> 02:27:29,350
No big deal. All right,
there you go. Go ahead.

2269
02:27:29,980 --> 02:27:34,210
And you wear skinny jeans,
skinny joggers,

2270
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:39,250
contemporary joggers from time to time
tracks at least four pounds kettlebell.

2271
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:43,540
It, it functionally it,
it adds it by the way,

2272
02:27:43,890 --> 02:27:46,030
got the gorilla ones a few weeks ago.
Um,

2273
02:27:46,480 --> 02:27:49,130
the 90 pound one is the big foot,

2274
02:27:49,930 --> 02:27:54,550
just for informational purposes ever.
Gonna make a hundred pound Jocko head.

2275
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:58,290
Actually, they said that people
have been saying there's been some,

2276
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:02,850
there's been some requests if anyone
would actually want that. I saw,

2277
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:04,960
I saw a guy sent me a two.

2278
02:28:05,110 --> 02:28:09,970
It was a 200 5,200 something
pound kettle bell. Dang.

2279
02:28:10,570 --> 02:28:15,190
I don't even know what I mean. Yeah,
I guess. Right? Goals. That's a legit,

2280
02:28:15,220 --> 02:28:17,290
there's like, you know, some
people are just mute and strong.

2281
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:22,220
One of my team Guy Buddies, just mute and
strong. I ain't Jiu Jitsu. Great Dude,

2282
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:26,960
but he got the beast. I
don't know who makes it,

2283
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:28,730
but there's a kettlebell called the beast.

2284
02:28:28,850 --> 02:28:31,280
I think it's like 102 pounds or something,

2285
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:36,760
but there was like this little test taming
the beast and he got the kettle bell

2286
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:40,520
out of the box. Did the
test passed it? I was like,

2287
02:28:40,521 --> 02:28:44,990
I mean things that I couldn't do at
all. I was like, okay, you're legit.

2288
02:28:46,280 --> 02:28:49,190
Kettlebells are crazy.
Yeah. Actually it's cool.

2289
02:28:49,191 --> 02:28:53,660
That's like one of those exercises
that you, if you learn that the form,

2290
02:28:53,960 --> 02:28:56,320
it's like an added element because
you've got to learn the form.

2291
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:58,610
Then the strength and the learning,

2292
02:28:58,611 --> 02:29:01,370
the form is good for you
because you're developing.

2293
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:03,010
Okay.

2294
02:29:03,010 --> 02:29:07,630
You're developing a neuro
muscular connections. Yes. Boom.

2295
02:29:07,631 --> 02:29:11,800
Thank you. Amen. You know, it was lost
for words and you've had me covering move.

2296
02:29:12,370 --> 02:29:14,270
No problem. I got you.
But yeah, so you need,

2297
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:17,620
it's basically you have to learn to
balance something that's not balanced.

2298
02:29:17,650 --> 02:29:21,630
Yeah know it's good. Like that bag I
lifted in Maine, these guys, it'd be left.

2299
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:26,390
That's good. 200 pounds by
the way. No worries. You know,

2300
02:29:26,430 --> 02:29:31,260
it's super hard. I feel the first time
also they got what? Jump ropes. Macy's,

2301
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:35,440
you know, if your workout gets boring,
jacket doesn't have that problem. We know.

2302
02:29:35,470 --> 02:29:38,020
We know because you just won't care
here to win and all this stuff.

2303
02:29:38,200 --> 02:29:40,480
But some people they get bored,
you know, with a workout,

2304
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:44,650
you get all this cool stuff anyway.
A on it.com/ chocolate's a good one.

2305
02:29:45,130 --> 02:29:48,440
Also,
when you buy these extra,

2306
02:29:48,441 --> 02:29:51,560
I'll put a link to your journal
if you don't mind. Yeah. But yeah,

2307
02:29:51,700 --> 02:29:56,230
it was nothing to buy. It's
free. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But
if you know, you go on there,

2308
02:29:56,231 --> 02:30:00,310
I'll put in the book section
and Oh, that'd be awesome
if, yeah, man, it's good.

2309
02:30:00,820 --> 02:30:01,720
And if you,

2310
02:30:01,721 --> 02:30:06,220
if people want to get some of the
other books that Jocko talks about,

2314

That's good way to support small action.
Big Reaction.

2315
02:30:23,370 --> 02:30:26,370
It is a legit way to support
for sure it is. I'd be,

2316
02:30:26,580 --> 02:30:29,580
I got to ask that two times
now. Yeah. Once in Maine

2317
02:30:31,410 --> 02:30:35,790
and I think I was at an event the
other day, uh, and someone asked me,

2318
02:30:36,120 --> 02:30:40,250
he does it really help and I was
like, yes it is. Yeah, it, I,

2319
02:30:40,470 --> 02:30:44,400
I said it's exactly what echo says it
is. Yup. Small. Actually it takes what,

2320
02:30:44,401 --> 02:30:48,840
like three extra seconds.
Yeah. Small action. Boom. One,

2321
02:30:48,900 --> 02:30:52,470
two clicks, whatever. And you,
big support. Big Reaction.

2327
02:31:08,550 --> 02:31:11,730
We have a youtube channel I put was
the last video. I put it on there.

2328
02:31:13,210 --> 02:31:15,280
The book video.
Oh yeah.

2329
02:31:16,390 --> 02:31:21,260
Freedom fuel manual. Vdl Awesome job on
that by the way. We're both. Thank you.

2330
02:31:21,280 --> 02:31:24,240
Very cool. Pretty good video. I
thought it was pretty good too.

2331
02:31:24,750 --> 02:31:28,590
I felt Jocko did all the work really
lifting. That was a hard night too.

2332
02:31:28,591 --> 02:31:31,350
I mean you were lifting after
like a whole day. I was like Bro,

2333
02:31:31,351 --> 02:31:36,150
I'm not like a long day,
long day. You know him.

2334
02:31:36,151 --> 02:31:38,880
He's the kind of where I'm like okay,
I just need like the shots, you know,

2335
02:31:38,881 --> 02:31:41,460
cause we're doing it for like other stuff
and I'm going to grab the steels and

2336
02:31:41,461 --> 02:31:44,280
whatever and I was like,
I just need the shots.

2337
02:31:44,281 --> 02:31:47,250
What I'll do is I'll make it here so you
don't have to put on all that weight.

2338
02:31:47,310 --> 02:31:50,700
And he's like, no, I'll feel like plus if
I don't put the weights. I was like, Bro,

2339
02:31:50,701 --> 02:31:52,130
you're the man.
Same exact thing.

2340
02:31:52,390 --> 02:31:55,620
I was just shooting a video doing
lifting weights and they're like, yeah,

2341
02:31:55,621 --> 02:31:57,150
we're just going to do it
with no way. I'm like, no,

2342
02:31:57,151 --> 02:32:00,060
but kill the video that I want.

2343
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:04,440
The weight that I want to be on there is
135 pounds. I want that to be on video.

2344
02:32:04,441 --> 02:32:06,240
I don't want no wait to be on video.

2345
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:10,080
He even went one further that there
was a few shots that I was getting that

2346
02:32:10,081 --> 02:32:13,330
didn't show how much weight. It just
showed the front of the, you know,

2347
02:32:13,331 --> 02:32:16,530
it was like an angle you could kind of see
part of the way. Kind of. He's like, no.

2348
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:20,080
He's like, he wouldn't
allow him, so you know,

2349
02:32:20,640 --> 02:32:22,620
I took the Rob Jones
approach. I was like, okay,

2350
02:32:22,621 --> 02:32:23,580
I've got to move somewhere it around.

2351
02:32:23,581 --> 02:32:27,030
I'm going to use the opportunity
to make myself better. I out.

2352
02:32:27,110 --> 02:32:32,040
I was getting after it. He's a
method actor. That's exactly right.

2353
02:32:32,280 --> 02:32:35,650
Yeah. Hey, it worked out for him
and I dig it, but yeah, nonetheless,

2354
02:32:35,700 --> 02:32:40,200
back to youtube. Boom. We put
some videos on there including,

2355
02:32:40,201 --> 02:32:44,700
but not limited to the video version of
this podcast. Also additional videos,

2356
02:32:44,701 --> 02:32:48,560
excerpts and various other videos,
deleted scenes if you will.

2357
02:32:48,561 --> 02:32:53,561
A lot of times we talk rubbish
before we actually include,

2358
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:57,480
you know, or we don't
include in the podcast. Um,

2359
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:00,930
so sometimes we'll cut that up and put
it on there too to add in entertainment.

2360
02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:04,170
You know, here Jocko swear a lot. You
know, he doesn't swear that much on on,

2361
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:09,360
on the record, but you know, he
gets after it from time to time.

2362
02:33:09,790 --> 02:33:14,040
Also myth on the hanging out
with like one of my bros.

2363
02:33:17,300 --> 02:33:22,110
Effin just effing get nuts with F in
squats and your effing thing. He was like,

2364
02:33:22,111 --> 02:33:26,940
yeah, he like over did it
nonetheless. Yeah, youtube,

2365
02:33:26,941 --> 02:33:30,690
that's a good one. Um, also Jocko has
a store, if you didn't already know,

2366
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:35,810
guess what it's called. I want to go
on a limb. Say Jocko store the store.

2367
02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:39,030
It's that Jocko store.com. We've got
some t shirts on there. They're cool.

2368
02:33:39,210 --> 02:33:41,910
They're cool. You know, some
layers on those t shirts,

2369
02:33:41,911 --> 02:33:45,160
layers meaning not physical
layers. Uh, what do you call it?

2370
02:33:45,180 --> 02:33:49,860
Poetic layers.
Poetics that's really reaching.

2371
02:33:50,490 --> 02:33:53,960
It's reaching a lot of
good. It's pretty poetic. Is

2372
02:33:58,010 --> 02:34:00,810
that one myself. You know what the
layers are with that though, right?

2373
02:34:00,840 --> 02:34:04,800
If you look at the good shirt it has
jock was head. That's good, right?

2374
02:34:04,980 --> 02:34:07,350
But the good is backwards.
And here's the thing.

2375
02:34:07,351 --> 02:34:09,330
That's why when people try to
counterfeit that one, they don't,

2376
02:34:09,360 --> 02:34:12,180
they don't get the layers. They just
see jungle shaded old little old.

2377
02:34:12,210 --> 02:34:16,350
That's a marketing thing or whatever and
let's sell that. But they don't get it.

2378
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:19,270
They don't know the layers. The good is
backwards. It's backwards for a reason.

2379
02:34:19,271 --> 02:34:21,040
That better write it in the mirror.

2380
02:34:21,390 --> 02:34:24,280
Cause who are you saying that when you
hear that? Who are you saying that too?

2381
02:34:24,281 --> 02:34:28,330
You're not saying you know to your poor
daughter who's crying cause she skinned

2382
02:34:28,331 --> 02:34:31,740
her knee. You don't say good. She's like,
oh she cries more. That's not her main.

2383
02:34:31,850 --> 02:34:34,780
It's not your missing message to give
somebody else your message to give to

2384
02:34:34,781 --> 02:34:39,190
yourself and your daughter cry in the
first place. Well, she's sensitive.

2385
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:42,130
I'm cultivating her sensitive site.
That's all.

2386
02:34:42,190 --> 02:34:45,970
You're not wearing a tee shirt for
yourself to look down like that.

2387
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:51,070
We're in it so other people can read it.
You can read it in a typical case,

2388
02:34:51,071 --> 02:34:54,400
but not these teachers. That
tee shirt is for you. Create a,

2389
02:34:54,410 --> 02:34:58,420
for you with the message with Jacqueline's
face. Apparently that's free to,

2390
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:00,520
not for everybody,
but this is for you.

2391
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:05,050
And unless that's just an example
of the layers on the shirts,

2392
02:35:05,080 --> 02:35:08,410
Jocko stark.com. There's also some hoodies
on there, some travel mugs, bumper,

2393
02:35:08,411 --> 02:35:12,520
bumper stickers.
The Jocko 2016 I took it off.

2394
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:17,680
We lost that election. Yeah, you did.
Sorry, I got like 27 votes. Yeah,

2395
02:35:17,710 --> 02:35:20,050
I got some legit votes.
People posted them on Twitter.

2396
02:35:20,590 --> 02:35:25,060
Some people wrote me in straight
up. I did. You know what?

2397
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:30,580
I don't want Hillary Clinton. I don't
want Donald Trump. I want Jocko.

2398
02:35:30,610 --> 02:35:33,490
Yeah. I think it might've been
a good choice actually happen.

2399
02:35:34,180 --> 02:35:35,900
I think it might've been a good choice.
Yeah.

2400
02:35:35,901 --> 02:35:38,320
Someone actually told me that I
should run for vice president.

2401
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:43,390
That wouldn't have been a good
choice. Uh, I don't know if you would,

2402
02:35:43,391 --> 02:35:46,720
would've gotten my vote and I don't know.
I wouldn't have got my booty.

2403
02:35:48,570 --> 02:35:53,140
Nonetheless. There's some cool
stuff on Jocko star. That's
the point. Um, you know,

2404
02:35:53,230 --> 02:35:57,280
I'm not saying go buy some stuff. I'm
thinking go on there, see what up,

2405
02:35:57,310 --> 02:36:01,900
see what's on there. And
if you like something, get
something good way to support.

2406
02:36:02,170 --> 02:36:05,850
Also, there's a little thing
called psychological warfare.
You ever heard it? Yeah,

2407
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:09,370
I think I have. It's pretty dope habit.
I'll tell you what, all day. Okay.

2408
02:36:09,371 --> 02:36:14,371
So I don't have to let you know that
it's an album with tracks Jocko tracks.

2409
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:18,910
So basically if you don't already
know the Rob Jones notes, John knows,

2410
02:36:18,911 --> 02:36:20,020
I know obviously

2411
02:36:22,030 --> 02:36:26,830
let's say you're on your
campaign against weakness.

2412
02:36:26,831 --> 02:36:30,160
That's, that's the official
going turn candidate campaign
against weakness. Right.

2413
02:36:30,220 --> 02:36:33,400
And I'm going to be disciplined
in all these areas on my life.

2414
02:36:33,401 --> 02:36:35,650
Waking up early diet. I'm
going to work out, you know,

2415
02:36:36,040 --> 02:36:40,660
however many times a day study,
study, get smarter, work harder.

2416
02:36:40,910 --> 02:36:45,700
Yeah. Just normal stuff. Normal
getting after it. Yeah. Campaign.

2417
02:36:45,730 --> 02:36:49,260
Yeah. And you have a moment
of weakness like Jock,

2418
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:53,020
go with the mint chocolate chip ice cream.

2419
02:36:53,890 --> 02:36:57,480
Avoid that. Jock obviously didn't
listen to his own album with tracks,

2420
02:36:57,481 --> 02:37:00,910
taco tracks of psychological warfare.
What you do is anytime you,

2421
02:37:00,911 --> 02:37:05,620
you come across these moments of weakness,
listen, put a track, put a track in.

2422
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:08,860
Like if you're having a hard time waking
up you to hit the snooze, whatever, boom.

2423
02:37:08,910 --> 02:37:12,190
Get wake up, get up, wake up,
wake up, wake up and get after it.

2424
02:37:12,191 --> 02:37:16,310
That's the track name.
Help you right through that
weakness. Smashed the weakness

2425
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:20,810
out actually. But yeah, psychological
warfare, Jocko Willink, MP3,

2426
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:25,370
iTunes, wherever Amazon mp3s
are being distributed, that's
where you can get them.

2427
02:37:26,110 --> 02:37:29,390
Uh,
you can also on Amazon,

2428
02:37:29,730 --> 02:37:31,910
you can get something
called Jocko white tea.

2429
02:37:32,780 --> 02:37:36,410
Rob Jones had his first Jocko white tea
today. Delicious. Not only delicious,

2430
02:37:36,411 --> 02:37:39,260
but I've noticed you've
been very attentive.

2431
02:37:39,350 --> 02:37:44,180
You're words are crisp and clear.
I mean, you feel the power, right?

2432
02:37:44,680 --> 02:37:47,750
Yeah.
It totally angry at him.

2433
02:37:49,100 --> 02:37:50,060
He's ready to rock and roll.

2434
02:37:50,061 --> 02:37:55,061
Tenacity by a mental capacity
and Carissa at least tenfold.

2435
02:37:55,150 --> 02:37:59,570
Yeah, if not more. So there you go. Jocko
white tea. You can get that on Amazon.

2436
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:05,080
It t legit though. How good does it taste?
Oh, it's really good. And it does it,

2437
02:38:05,540 --> 02:38:09,710
it doesn't really taste like tea,
right? He likes kind of tastes like tea.

2438
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:12,050
Does have any sugar in it.
No.

2439
02:38:12,790 --> 02:38:15,890
You're telling me Jocko white tea doesn't
have any sugar and taste that good and

2440
02:38:15,891 --> 02:38:20,360
it tastes that good. What does it taste
like? Vegetable. It tastes like victory.

2441
02:38:21,190 --> 02:38:24,800
Uh, they, we got some books on Amazon
and wherever you want to buy books.

2442
02:38:24,980 --> 02:38:27,140
Extreme ownership,

2443

how you can apply those to business and

2444
02:38:31,401 --> 02:38:36,140

2445
02:38:36,530 --> 02:38:41,150
Weigh the warrior kid. That's what you
need to get for every kid. You know,

2446
02:38:41,190 --> 02:38:42,770
it is so helpful for kids.

2447
02:38:42,771 --> 02:38:47,180
I wish I had that book when I
was nine years old, 10 years old,

2448
02:38:47,181 --> 02:38:48,020
11 years old.

2449
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:52,460
It is so helpful and I'm
getting such great feedback.

2450
02:38:52,760 --> 02:38:55,400
So by that,
for the kids,

2451
02:38:55,401 --> 02:38:58,940
you know for sure coming up soon.

2452
02:39:00,170 --> 02:39:02,750
The discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2453
02:39:04,440 --> 02:39:05,273
Okay,

2454
02:39:05,360 --> 02:39:07,970
that's right.
It is a field manual.

2455
02:39:08,240 --> 02:39:13,240
How to implement and execute
operation discipline into your life.

2456
02:39:15,050 --> 02:39:19,430
Fall the field manual.
You can get it from your local bookstore.

you just want to check in,

2464
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:51,850
we are rolling kind of deep
on the Inter webs on Twitter,

2465
02:39:53,960 --> 02:39:55,100
on Instagram

2466
02:39:56,660 --> 02:39:59,300
and a face sheet ball hockey.

2467
02:40:01,910 --> 02:40:06,910
Rob Jones is at Rob Jones
Journey at Rob Jones journey.

2468
02:40:07,670 --> 02:40:12,670
He's going to be documenting all this
awesome slash could be stupid but could be

2469
02:40:14,281 --> 02:40:18,900
mostly awesome stuff that he's doing and
we like to watch people do crazy stuff.

2470
02:40:18,930 --> 02:40:19,763
So yeah,

2471
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:23,220
we're going to watch you do that and I'll
post a picture and then usually I like

2472
02:40:23,221 --> 02:40:25,050
to put a little snippet
of wisdom in there.

2473
02:40:25,940 --> 02:40:30,000
It's a little paragraph for people to
read. Nice a day. So the New York Times.

2474
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:32,540
Yeah. Don't, don't do that.
Just go straight to the,

2475
02:40:32,541 --> 02:40:34,970
to the Rob Jones snippet of wisdom.
Yeah.

2476
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:39,030
I like the example how you say you want
to be the example because some people

2477
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:41,070
they say, I just want to be the
exempt, but they don't explain it.

2478
02:40:41,071 --> 02:40:44,640
You just explained her actually in a way
that was kind of revealing to me where

2479
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:46,620
it makes sense. You know,
you're like, Hey, I'm going to,

2480
02:40:46,621 --> 02:40:48,960
and this goes for everything by the way,
like if you want to,

2481
02:40:49,920 --> 02:40:53,100
I do like a special effects sometimes
and I'm like, man, I want to do this,

2482
02:40:53,101 --> 02:40:56,140
but man, that's like some high enough,
I can't do it on this. And then,

2483
02:40:56,160 --> 02:40:59,520
but then let's say look it up on
Youtube and be like, oh wait, look,

2484
02:40:59,521 --> 02:41:02,660
he did it right here. And then, you know,
sometimes it show him house show house,

2485
02:41:02,661 --> 02:41:06,030
sometimes they don't. But like how
you said like if you don't think,

2486
02:41:06,031 --> 02:41:09,720
like if you think, oh, you had
that kind of can't be done.

2487
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,930
You don't like for so many of my
position or whatever, you know?

2488
02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:14,070
But then you see someone all the way,

2489
02:41:14,071 --> 02:41:16,920
he's doing it and then you're doing it
where it's like you're doing even more.

2490
02:41:17,220 --> 02:41:19,980
So it's like, ah, you're kind of
reaching more people in that way.

2491
02:41:20,130 --> 02:41:23,250
Cause still you're doing
these crazy things. Maybe one,

2492
02:41:23,251 --> 02:41:25,140
maybe two other people be
like, yeah, I can do that too.

2493
02:41:25,560 --> 02:41:28,380
But most people there'll be like,
can do that easy stuff,

2494
02:41:28,560 --> 02:41:30,540
but I can do all this other stuff.
You know what I mean?

2495
02:41:30,570 --> 02:41:32,700
Other stuff that they didn't
think they could do before.

2496
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:35,500
That's good. That's the word.
It's crazy. That's stupid.

2497
02:41:35,501 --> 02:41:39,340
The stuff you're doing is
awesome. It's crazy. You've
got to be crazy to do it. Uh,

2498
02:41:40,480 --> 02:41:45,280
so yeah, Rob Jones Journey
and that includes Rob Jones,

2499
02:41:45,281 --> 02:41:47,260

which in that from there you can get the
d to the donation page for when you're

2501
02:41:52,091 --> 02:41:54,520
starting all this, all this, uh,

2502
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:58,690
31 marathons in 31 days.

2503
02:41:58,830 --> 02:42:00,720
Most people run a marathon and it,

2504
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:05,140
I think I've read it takes like six months
to actually recover from a marathon.

2505
02:42:06,290 --> 02:42:08,440
Yeah, I guess it depends on
your level of preparedness,

2506
02:42:08,470 --> 02:42:11,530
but try and do it in about six hours.

2507
02:42:14,180 --> 02:42:17,240
That is awesome.
Echo is at echo.

2508
02:42:17,241 --> 02:42:21,770
Charles and I am at Willink Echo.
You got anything else for today?

2509
02:42:22,220 --> 02:42:26,120
Thank you for coming on. Rob Jones. Rob,

2510
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:27,980
any closing thoughts from you?

2511
02:42:28,770 --> 02:42:29,180
Oh,

2512
02:42:29,180 --> 02:42:34,180
I just want to start by pointing out that
I think every guest you've ever had on

2513
02:42:35,091 --> 02:42:40,091
this podcast is somebody that I
consider to be a hero and I it,

2514
02:42:40,340 --> 02:42:41,360
I don't throw that around.

2515
02:42:41,390 --> 02:42:46,390
They're patriots and they are heroes and
it is humbling for me to be included.

2516
02:42:48,320 --> 02:42:53,320
For you to have me on the
podcast is vastly humbling
for me to be included among

2517
02:42:54,801 --> 02:42:58,490
the people that you deem
worthy of being on the podcast.

2518
02:42:58,940 --> 02:43:01,100
So I just want to thank both of you for,

2519
02:43:01,280 --> 02:43:06,280
for having me and giving
me this opportunity and I
just hope that some of the

2520
02:43:06,801 --> 02:43:09,440
stuff that I said can resonate
with with some of the,

2521
02:43:09,500 --> 02:43:12,580
some of the listeners and beyond that

2522
02:43:14,410 --> 02:43:16,900
I've done a lot of stuff,
but

2523
02:43:18,730 --> 02:43:23,560
nobody does that by themselves. I have
had so many people that have helped me,

2524
02:43:24,490 --> 02:43:26,830
therapist, prosthetist, coaches,

2525
02:43:26,890 --> 02:43:31,720
mentors and family,
friends.

2526
02:43:32,560 --> 02:43:34,990
And then especially Pam,
I mean

2527
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:38,920
I told you before she's doing everything.

2528
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:43,060
She was instrumental in getting
this podcast done, getting me on as,

2529
02:43:43,180 --> 02:43:47,320
as a guest here, took it upon
herself to, to tweet you.

2530
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:52,930
She's calling press, she's
helping me get venues. She's,

2531
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:58,010
it's been incredible and she's
my number one supporter and uh,

2532
02:43:58,541 --> 02:44:02,470
you know, too good for me, but
hopefully she doesn't listen to that.

2533
02:44:03,310 --> 02:44:08,200
Hopefully he's still, she'll
continue to be diluted. Um, but yeah,

2534
02:44:08,230 --> 02:44:12,940
I mean I'm,
I'm at the top of the pyramid.

2535
02:44:13,690 --> 02:44:18,160
Like I get all the kind of the notoriety
and the congratulations for doing the

2536
02:44:18,161 --> 02:44:22,000
stuff that I've done. But without the
base of the pyramid, the pyramid is shit.

2537
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:26,710
It's to block on the ground.
So without all these people,

2538
02:44:27,740 --> 02:44:30,550
I mean, I wouldn't have accomplished
it. I would have, I might have tried,

2539
02:44:30,551 --> 02:44:34,270
but I wouldn't be, I wouldn't be where I
am. Probably wouldn't be on the podcast.

2540
02:44:34,271 --> 02:44:35,800
I've wouldn't have actually done anything.

2541
02:44:37,300 --> 02:44:42,060
Well, you know, for everyone
that's come on and, and,

2542
02:44:42,061 --> 02:44:43,580
and to sit here and have you,

2543
02:44:44,810 --> 02:44:48,650
you know that they have you and the
people that have come on this podcast and

2544
02:44:48,651 --> 02:44:51,650
have you sitting across the table from
me and be able to spend time with you

2545
02:44:51,651 --> 02:44:53,180
yesterday and hang out with you.

2546
02:44:53,780 --> 02:44:58,780
I am rewarded a thousand fold
a thousand fold from you.

2547
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:03,140
To me, that's, that's
where the reward comes.

2548
02:45:03,500 --> 02:45:08,500
And it's an honor a thousand fold for you
to be here and be sitting here talking

2549
02:45:09,351 --> 02:45:13,040
to me.
And I thank you for coming on.

2550
02:45:13,520 --> 02:45:15,770
I thank you for your service.

2551
02:45:15,890 --> 02:45:19,220
I thank you for your sacrifice.

2552
02:45:21,270 --> 02:45:25,560
I thank you for the example that
you're setting, which is awesome.

2553
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:26,340
And,

2554
02:45:26,340 --> 02:45:31,170
and showing everyone
what it really means to,

2555
02:45:32,250 --> 02:45:33,660
to persevere

2556
02:45:35,760 --> 02:45:37,810
and to not only

2557
02:45:40,120 --> 02:45:42,430
not only overcome challenges,

2558
02:45:42,610 --> 02:45:47,610
but you are in bracing those challenges
and turning the harshest of challenges

2559
02:45:50,190 --> 02:45:53,130
into something positive
and something good.

2560
02:45:56,950 --> 02:45:59,620
And that is what I'm thanking you for,

2561
02:45:59,621 --> 02:46:04,621
for explaining what it really means to
adapt and overcome no matter what we

2562
02:46:05,831 --> 02:46:10,310
face.
And to everyone out there that's listening

2563
02:46:12,170 --> 02:46:13,910
and you're going through hard times,

2564
02:46:13,911 --> 02:46:18,911
or you're facing a rough patch or a
challenge or an obstacle in your life,

2565
02:46:20,720 --> 02:46:24,200
adapt to it,
grow from it,

2566
02:46:25,790 --> 02:46:30,050
overcome it,
transcend it,

2567
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:35,930
and use the weight of that challenge

2568
02:46:37,670 --> 02:46:38,780
to make you stronger.

2569
02:46:43,160 --> 02:46:46,890
And until next time,
this is Rob Jones,

2570
02:46:47,700 --> 02:46:51,120
an echo and Jocko out.
