00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,370
This is Jocko podcast number
97 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,310
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,600
to the master stone Mason

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,750
in the town of Mansfield.

5
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,900
Greetings and God,
much beloved parents.

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,820
If my small letter finds you in good
health, I should be mightily glad.

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,430
What concerns me?

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:36,700
I am pretty much in health here in
the white country will have to die.

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,660
All of hunger,

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,310
all is burnt and the Russian army has
carried off all subjects as they had such

11
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:55,580
a fear of us and there is no food to be
found because nobody is to be found in

12
00:00:55,581 --> 00:00:59,090
any town.
Whenever a house is found,

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,830
it is empty and dark.
Dear parents,

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,780
I have to give news of our last battle
as we had already gone hungry for three

15
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:11,930
days and March day and night
at five in the morning,

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,990
we marched into this battle
with the cabbage stump in
our stomach and we were in

17
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,910
in it until the evening

18
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,330
and then we again had nothing
and could not eat for tiredness.

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,200
Only cannon fire from morning to evening.

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,520
God has helped me out of the third battle.
Also without harm though.

21
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:41,990
The bullets hailed down pretty well as
if one were to take peas and throw them

22
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:44,600
at someone,
but none got me.

23
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,710
The whole cavalry is lost.

24
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,260
Now I want to write you about
the Russian town of misery,

25
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,340
Moscow,

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,120
which is seven hours walk along and as
wide and the Russians put fire to it for

27
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:08,831
four hours at burned and then it was
extinguished and we were stationed before

28
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:10,814
Moscow.

29
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,590
And I don't know whether we
are going forward or back.

30
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,500
I don't know what to write

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,600
except that you will shortly see many
cripples without arm and leg and so many

32
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:30,200
must die pitifully of
hunger and terrible dangers.

33
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,110
Russians appear all the time for
the last battle. Let's end now.

34
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,470
Finally, farewell and stay
healthy until we speak again.

35
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,090
Many greetings to brothers and sisters,

36
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,180
brothers in law and sisters in law to
the Balts ans the Krogans and all good

37
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:57,521
friends and acquaintances and I am
quite well if only I can live farewell.

38
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,060
I remain your faithful son until death.

39
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,600
Johann Andreas Warner.

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,200
So Napoleon

41
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,070
who is often praised by
many in coding myself,

42
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,620
praised as a military genius.

43
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,480
And he was one of the first military
leaders to effectively utilize

44
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,710
psychological warfare.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,880
And this included most famously
his bulletin's de la Grand Army,

46
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,430
which was sort of an update.

47
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:47,431
It was like a newspaper that was sent out
while the campaigns of France or being

48
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,870
embarked upon.
And that was his media.

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,960
So he had control of it and he also
controlled the mail that his troops sent

50
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:03,361
home and made sure that it
painted a positive picture
of what was happening down

51
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,930
range. And that is where that
opening letter came from,

52
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,410
that it was actually excerpts of a letter,

53
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:16,411
but it was confiscated by the
military of the Kingdom of Westfalia,

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,220
which was a vassal state
under the first French empire,

55
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,640
which was Napoleon's empire
and the Kingdom of West Valeo,

56
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,590
which is a German piece of land.

57
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,770
And it provided hundreds of thousands
of soldiers for the Napoleonic wars.

58
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,260
And when I say provided soldiers,

59
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:44,320
I should say specifically calm scripts,

60
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,230
which are basically slave soldiers,
you have no choice.

61
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,430
You will go and fight

62
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,530
and overtime Westfalia eventually
conquered by the Russians for a period.

63
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,130
And then some of the
confiscated letters survived.

64
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:08,131
And ended up as historical documents
that explained what was happening on the

65
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:09,334
ground.

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,950
And that's where that letter came from
through old Russian files where they had,

67
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,100
they had this letter,
and again,

68
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:23,101
we make a habit of glorifying Napoleon
and I have done it right here on this

69
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,094
podcast,

70
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,270
which is actually pretty substandard
behavior for me since I always try to

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,800
listen to the voice and hear the voice
and understand the viewpoint of the foot

72
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:44,140
soldier, the grunt, the front
line troops on the battlefield.

73
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,870
Because that is where
the fighting takes place.

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,920
Those are the men that execute
the plans of the general.

75
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,150
And that is where the
wars are actually want.

76
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,630
And history as a whole has a
tendency to forget about them

77
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,810
because generally it's the admirals and
the generals that right the memoirs.

78
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,800
But in this case we are going to
hear from one of Napoleon's grunts,

79
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,780
a guy by the name of Jacob Walter,

80
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,410
and he is a German conscripts
who was fighting for France.

81
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:35,850
So this is a guy grew up in Germany,
but when Germany was,

82
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,480
became part of and became a vassal state,

83
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,720
like a subordinate state
of the empire France.

84
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,360
Then he ended up fighting for France,
but even more,

85
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:50,040
and you're going to find this out quickly.

86
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,640
He was fighting for his own survival.

87
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,200
So let's go to this book.

88
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:03,201
The book is called the diary of a
Napoleonic foot soldier by Jacob Walter.

89
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,220
And here we go.

90
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,730
In the year 1806 I was drafted with many
of my comrades into military service in

91
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:22,061
the conscription at that time and was
assigned to the regimen of Romaic in the

92
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:24,171
fall.

93
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:29,000
I traveled with the regiment
to Prussia in the campaign,

94
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:34,001
which Emperor Napoleon with the princes
then his allies was conducting at that

95
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,140
time against pressure.

96
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:40,010
And this is interesting because I've
talked about on this podcast before,

97
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,990
the battle of Jenna and what happened
at the battle of Jenna and what happened

98
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:49,991
at the battle of is that the Prussian
army was defeated pretty savagely by

99
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,000
Napoleon's army.

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,290
And that made them make some major
adjustments to the way they ran things.

101
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,620
And that was kind of the beginning of
decentralized command from the German

102
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:05,540
perspective. But this guy, Walter
Jacob Walter was actually there.

103
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,450
Now this is what's interesting, and I, I,

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,400
I go take some time to paint this picture
of the way these soldiers operated

105
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:14,420
back then.
First of all,

106
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,790
they marched just about everywhere
and sometimes they'd ride horses,

107
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,150
but sometimes they are, but most of the
Times they marched and when they marched,

108
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,930
what they would do is just wherever they
were, whatever village they were in,

109
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,060
they would go in and get quarters
in that village. They'd go in, hey,

110
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:32,390
we're here where we need to stay in
your house and we need to get fed.

111
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,920
And that's what they did. And people
allowed them to do it. I mean,

112
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,450
a bunch of people with guns show up at
your house and say, we want food and beds.

113
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,350
You, you know, these people gave them
what they wanted sometimes willingly,

114
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:47,480
depending when they were traveling
out of their own country.

115
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,350
So when they were in Germany
there or in their Westfalia,

116
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,710
the locals as they were
leaving, the locals would give
him, Hey, we'll support you.

117
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,210
It's like military guy,
we'll support you.

118
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:59,340
And then when they got
into enemy territory,

119
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,500
they would be asked to be more forceful.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,410
But here's how it starts
off with him marching.

121
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,570
We were given good quarters everywhere,

122
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,040
which kept me always healthy and cheerful
in spite of the continuous marching.

123
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,800
Furthermore, I was only
19 years old, a fact,

124
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:20,010
which caused me frequently to
participate in thoughtless and dangerous

125
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:23,250
enterprises. I think he was getting
after it as a young 19 year old,

126
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,990
and this is another thing
that's interesting. So
this guy, these conscripts,

127
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,480
they weren't,
they weren't permanent soldiers.

128
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:34,100
They were more like reservists where
they would go and fight and win.

129
00:09:34,101 --> 00:09:36,840
The war was over. They go back home and
continue with whatever their job was.

130
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,530
And so that's what happens to
him. He, you know, gets tasked.

131
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,140
He's only 19 years old. Boom, you're
going to go fight. He says, okay.

132
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,100
He starts going in,
marching back to the book in this city.

133
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:51,150
It happened in my quarter that a comrade
wanted to force the landlord to sing.

134
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,250
However he refused to do so. Sitting the
whole night on a bench near the stove,

135
00:09:56,251 --> 00:10:00,980
weeping. Since this man could not
sing because of his sorrow, sorrow,

136
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,430
soldier, Hummel wanting to
frighten him, took his rifle,

137
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,460
cock the hammer and shot the bullet passed
by me and another soldier and lodged

138
00:10:10,371 --> 00:10:11,060
in the wall.

139
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,080
I wanted to mention this in order to show
how the soldiers were running wild at

140
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,380
that time. So like I said, when
they were in their own country,

141
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,990
they'd get good support and
everyone would take care of them,

142
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:24,440
but then the further they got into
other countries, they had to use force.

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,433
Hmm.

144
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,210
A spy who was in the village,
a spy who was a village.

145
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,610
Smith was brought before the guard house.

146
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,560
He had letters in orders to tell
Prussians of our strength in manpower.

147
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,150
He was laid on a bench and
whipped by two or three corporals.

148
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,090
Two men had to hold his
feet and to his head,

149
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,890
his leather breaches were stretched
out and water poured on them.

150
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,670
And then he received about 150 blows.

151
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,630
Okay.

152
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,170
At last he could no longer
speak because he was half dead

153
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,110
after this experience, the Smith was
taking to the threshing floor and shot.

154
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,540
Yeah.

155
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,540
Glows with clubs also were heaped upon
many innocent people in this city.

156
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,430
So these guys are
things turn bad real quick.

157
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,470
Things turn bad real quick.

158
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,550
And I can't even imagine these days where
there's a lot less accountability and

159
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:31,630
you have 19 year old soldiers coming
into towns and just basically doing

160
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:35,830
whatever they want back
to the book. Finally,

161
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,420
when light fire, now they're getting
into uh, an attack situation. Finally,

162
00:11:40,421 --> 00:11:42,820
when light firing began upon the outpost,

163
00:11:42,821 --> 00:11:46,970
we were commanded to attack by waiting
through the rampart ditches with fancy

164
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:47,470
jeans,

165
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,120
with fast scenes to tread these in and
to scramble up the outworks by chopping

166
00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:55,090
and shoveling.
When I stood in the ditch,

167
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,960
each first soldier had to pull
up the next one with his rifle.

168
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,270
The ramparts were of sand and everyone
frequently fell back again because of the

169
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:07,990
attack of the enemy or just
because of the sliding sand.

170
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,340
Yet in that place,

171
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,230
the huge cannon balls flew above us
funding so violently that we would have

172
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:18,910
believed the earth would burst to pieces
when everyone was almost on top of the

173
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,630
earthwork.

174
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,490
The Prussians were slaughtered with
great vigor and the rest took flight into

175
00:12:24,491 --> 00:12:25,324
the gate.

176
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,280
Then we to wanted to gain possession of
the gateway in order to enter the city,

177
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,720
but at this critical time,

178
00:12:31,721 --> 00:12:36,550
many of these Prussians were shot along
with our men by small and large guns and

179
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:41,551
the gate was closed since all sorts
of shells and rockets broke out of the

180
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,980
fortress like a cloudburst.
We had to take flight.

181
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,800
Those who meanwhile we're scrambling up.

182
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,550
The outworks had to jump from the
fortress into the mote along with their

183
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,430
prisoners and all the
rest had to do likewise.

184
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,330
During this retreat,
many fell on bay in nets.

185
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,100
Many drowned and many of us were also
brought into the fortress as prisoners and

186
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:07,810
sent away to Danzig by see.
Now it's interesting,

187
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:12,340
this guy, the way he writes, it's very
matter of fact as to what happens,

188
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,390
and again, this is a relatively, I'm going
to take you to through three campaigns.

189
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,100
This is the first one.
The last one is the campaign and Russia,

190
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,200
the famous Napoleon's famous march into
Russia to try and take Russia at and

191
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:29,560
everyone knows how that story ends.
It's not good,

192
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,000
but this first one is, like
I said, against the Prussians

193
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,780
back to the book one morning,
the Prussian surprise,

194
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:41,920
the Polish camp from the sea with their
ships. As it happened before Easter,

195
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,810
the cannon fire on the polls was so
heavy that they could not withdraw fast

196
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:47,644
enough.

197
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,960
Their cannon balls also traveled more
than half again as far toward our camp as

198
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:57,961
all balls date across the water since the
surrounding swamps were frozen and the

199
00:13:58,121 --> 00:14:03,121
balls could roll along on ice so fast
that one ball took off the feet and legs

200
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,820
of 10 or 12 men frequently,

201
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,500
both feet of the same man.
During this blockade,

202
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,480
the Prussians frequently made attacks,
although every time with great losses,

203
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,260
one the nightmare that is you're standing
on frozen swamps and these cannonballs

204
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,850
or.
