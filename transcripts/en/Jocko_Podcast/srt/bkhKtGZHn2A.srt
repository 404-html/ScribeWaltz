1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,570
This is Jocko podcast number
one 45 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,820
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,580
The primary mission of the Marine
Rifle Company and platoon is to locate,

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,210
close with and destroy the enemy by fire
and maneuver or to repel his assault by

5
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:27,450
fire and close combat.

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,743
Yeah.

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:35,860
The primary mission of the weapons
platoon of the rifle company is to provide

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,950
supporting direct and indirect fires
including clothes in anti tank fires and

9
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:46,480
demolitions for maneuvering or
defending elements of the rifle company.

10
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,790
Okay.

11
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,623
Boom.

12
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,330
It does not get much more
straight forward than that.

13
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,780
That is taken directly from FM FM
six tack for Marine Rifle Company.

14
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,290
And this is a, this is a solid
manual, a very solid manual.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,190
Very solid field manual.
Huh.

16
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,820
And one of the reasons
that I pulled it out again,

17
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:19,760
because I wanted to look at the
general principles of war and this has,

18
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,970
so the the U s military,

19
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:26,960
all branches talk about the principles
of war as the Amir as America sees the

20
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,810
principles of war.
For whatever reason,

21
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,110
the FM FM t six tack for has sort of the
best descriptions of them that I like,

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,710
I should say maybe they're not the best.

23
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,860
They're my preferential
once the ones that I prefer.

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,350
So the principles of war
pretty straight forward,

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,200
but I wanted to talk about them and
this kind of led me down a little rabbit

26
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:56,120
hole, which I sometimes go into when it
comes to, you know, military strategies,

27
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,570
principals, tactics. Sure. And
I ended up in a place that I,

28
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,070
that I thought was very interesting.

29
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:04,490
It kind of brought me back to something
that I had uncovered years ago.

30
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,710
One of those early things that started to

31
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,910
Gel. My thought process started
to, started to see little,

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,530
little, little connections
in the world. Yeah.

33
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,470
So it started with this.
So the principles of war,

34
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:27,050
so they talk about just these
broad principles of war. Again,

35
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:31,310
everyone in the military covers these
prints are ever in the u s military covers

36
00:02:31,311 --> 00:02:32,450
these principles of war.

37
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,750
Here's how the Marine Corp in the Marine
Rifle Company manual discusses them.

38
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,920
Okay.
Principles of war general.

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,100
The principles of war are fundamental
truths governing the prosecution of war.

40
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,200
That's so legit. Anyways,
I'm going to read that again.

41
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,260
The principles of war are fundamental
truths governing the prosecution of war.

42
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,130
There you go.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,510
The principles of war are guidelines to
be used by a commander to effectively

44
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:12,010
apply the combat power of the marine
company or platoon to aid in the

45
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:13,720
accomplishment of the assigned mission.

46
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,130
The effective application of these
principles is essential to the proper

47
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:21,850
exercise of command
and the conduct of war.

48
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,540
Although combat leaders
have studied the principles,

49
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,510
it is not enough to name them in sequence,

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,100
but rather to know when and how to
relate them to the combat environment.

51
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,250
The principles of war are included here
to provide a review for the commander to

52
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,070
be used when applying doctrine
contained in this manual. Now,

53
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:45,550
the important parts of remember is,
and you're going to see this,

54
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,350
that these principles do not only
apply to war at all. In fact,

55
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,550
they apply to everything.

56
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,690
Okay?

57
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,360
Principle number one objective.

58
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,640
The objective of a military force is
the goal or aim usually expressed as a

59
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:07,490
mission for which the
force was constituted.

60
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,070
This principle is overriding,
it's,

61
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,990
it is the apple. It is applicable to
any operation at any level of command.

62
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,910
The objective of a force can be stated
in either broad or precise terms,

63
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,920
depending upon the nature of the goal.

64
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:29,360
Each element of an infantry
unit contributes to the
attainment of the objective

65
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,560
of the larger unit of which it is a part.
For example,

66
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,290
when the objective of a
battalion has been defined,

67
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,030
all elements of the battalion must be
assigned objectives that facilitate the

68
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,410
attainment of the battalion.

69
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:47,411
Objective success in combat is measured
by the accomplishment of the mission.

70
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,110
So this is important to remember
from a leadership perspective.

71
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,450
When you come up with a mission and it's
a broad mission for your company or for

72
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:57,284
your team,

73
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,530
then the smaller teams within your team
have got to redefine that mission as it

74
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:07,580
applies to them and make sure that what
they come up with for mission is aligned

75
00:05:07,581 --> 00:05:09,830
with and supports the
broader mission of the team.

76
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,370
So when you own a manufacturing plant
and your goal is to manufacturer x amount

77
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:21,410
of widgets a month,
well then the people on the line,

78
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:25,100
they have their little portion of that
widget that they manufacturer and they

79
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:28,190
got to make sure that they can fulfill
their part of mission that allows you to

80
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,580
do this overall success.
Also,

81
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,060
there's like supply people that are
bringing the supplies in for the widget.

82
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,080
Their goal,

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,140
their mission is to provide the supplies
needed to make these things and so

84
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,130
that's what it is.
You've got to make sure that the,

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,900
the mission of the sub subordinate units
are in support of a nested inside of

86
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:51,614
the broader mission,

87
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:57,130
but sometimes we forget as leaders that
the f the front line or the subordinate

88
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,450
people below you and the chain of command,

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,020
they might not understand that they
need to do that might not happen,

90
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,030
so you need to do it for him. Sometimes
you need to spell things out. Yeah,

91
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,520
next or offensive

92
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,640
by the offensive,

93
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,170
the commander can impose
his will on the enemy,

94
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,210
set the pace and course of battle,

95
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:26,140
exploit enemy weaknesses
and meet unexpected.

96
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,090
Develop a developments. Boom, be on the
offensive. What do, what do we call this?

97
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,740
We call this default aggressive, right?
That's the, that's the similar not,

98
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,840
and I will continue to make
the comparisons between
what we talk about w what I

99
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:43,510
taught,
what I came up with,

100
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:48,511
the original four laws of combat and
how they are intertwined with these

101
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,240
principals.
Back

102
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,990
to the book.
Even in the defensive,

103
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,620
the commander must be alert to
regain the initiative by offensive,

104
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,670
counteractions aggressiveness,
flexibility of mind,

105
00:07:06,671 --> 00:07:11,671
and the ability to make rapid reasoned
decisions are required to apply fully the

106
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:15,370
principle of the offensive.
In defense,

107
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:19,150
the commander can often best accomplish
his mission by office of action.

108
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,440
So even when you're on defense,
you should be,

109
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,840
you should be looking
to go on the offense.

110
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,800
And there's some other definitions that
talk about, and this is very, very clear.

111
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,910
When you're training Jujitsu, have
you ever trained with someone? Well,

112
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:37,420
I know you have. When you're training
with someone that's constantly attacking,

113
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,280
yes, that's, that's you're
going to go down. I mean,
you're going to, when someone,

114
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,950
that's how someone gets the upper hand.
They're attacking here. They're attacking.

115
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,030
They're,
they're attacking over here.

116
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,510
They're attacking back there again and
you're constantly on the defense, defense,

117
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:52,320
defense, defense, and eventually they
get the upper hand and crush you. Yeah,

118
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,670
very clear.
In Jujitsu.

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,910
[inaudible]
next

120
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,790
simplicity.

121
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,701
Simplicity.

122
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:08,020
Demands that detailed a simple plans
be adopted in every military operation.

123
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,260
It's interesting dichotomy,
detailed and simple.

124
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,230
It is of course a relative term because
all actions in war are essentially

125
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:20,950
complex. That's a great point.
And I talk about that too.

126
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,250
I talk about how easy it is to
like how these, how a mission, hey,

127
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:27,040
so easy to see a seal mission
is not rocket science, right?

128
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,730
It's not brain surgery. You've,
you know where the bad guy is,

129
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,110
you know where you are.

130
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,990
You're going to load in some helicopters
are some vehicles, are some boats.

131
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:36,830
You're going to go to where they are
and you're going to get them and you're

132
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,770
gonna come back. There's the mission
that's a little over simplified.

133
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,660
To me it'd be,
and it's not that much over simplified,

134
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:47,350
but you know there's things like fuel,
there's things like load load plans.

135
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:48,161
There's thing about weight,

136
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:51,250
how much each vehicle can carry or how
much each helicopter can carry this.

137
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:54,140
So there's there are and how you're
going to put cover fire down there. A,

138
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,110
there are more detailed things.
So like the statement says,

139
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,980
all actions in war are
essentially complex.

140
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:07,070
And I will say that all actions in
war are also essentially simple.

141
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,880
Hmm.
Because what are you trying to do?

142
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,250
You're trying to close with and
destroy the enemy. That's it.

143
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,800
I've had that happen with companies
where I go into a company and

144
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,420
they've lost sight of the
simplicity of their mission. Yeah.

145
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,290
The simplicity of the mission is to
make something and they get all wrapped

146
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:24,460
around all these other things,

147
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,050
but what you're supposed to be doing is
making this thing and everything that

148
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:31,840
you're doing should be lead to
supporting the making of this thing.

149
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,630
And people go down,
they focus their efforts in other areas.

150
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,880
So it's good to think about. Yes,
there's complexities. It's, it's,

151
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,280
it's a total dichotomy. It's a total
dichotomy in business too, right?

152
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,790
There's a total dichotomy.
It's, it's very complicated,

153
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,220
but at the same time it's
actually very simple. Hmm.

154
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,400
So when you feel things
getting too complicated,

155
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:53,380
that's when you take a step
back and go, okay, what is we,

156
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,440
what are we actually trying to do here?
That's the question.

157
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,371
Back to the book.

158
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:05,140
Simplicity will be especially important
on the new Keeler battlefield.

159
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,473
Yeah.

160
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,300
Where the full use of available
means will require close control and

161
00:10:11,301 --> 00:10:15,620
coordination and where plans must be
simple, as simple as the situation will,

162
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,650
will permit detailed simple plans
lead to coordinated timely execution.

163
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,320
So what's interesting at the
copy that I'm using of this,

164
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,260
and it's going to lead to the rest
of this whole podcast, which award,

165
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,220
which is when we're going to start talking
about the Soviets and which goes back

166
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:36,800
to the eighties I think
the date on this book,

167
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:41,801
on this particular version is
the eighties which is cold war,

168
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,470
prepare for nuclear combat.

169
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,410
That and when are we getting to the
Soviets and what they're thinking you're

170
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:53,411
gonna see nuclear combat was absolutely
part of it was part of their planning.

171
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,330
Yeah.
And so same thing here.

172
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,780
I don't even know that I have a comment
about keeping your nuclear war simple.

173
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,500
I don't know if I have a comment on that.
Hey,

174
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,980
we're going to drop bombs
and everyone is going to die.

175
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,980
I don't know how we simplify that anymore.

176
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,120
And clearly laws a combat simplicity,
simple.

177
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,250
That's one of the primary laws.

178
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,320
That's actually law number two in my
laws of combat that we put an extreme

179
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,720
ownership.
And why is that?

180
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,750
Because I would see over and over and
over again what would jam up to use your

181
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:35,060
term, what would jam up? A seal
platoon is a complicated plan.

182
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,960
You would do it every single time
so you have to keep it simple.

183
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,980
That's one of those ones.

184
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,910
Before I really started diving into sort
of the broad canon of military theory,

185
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,500
I, I had told everyone, hey,
you got to keep it simple.
You gotta keep it. And Anna,

186
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,290
I'd been told, you know, the Vietnam
guys would say keep it simple, stupid,

187
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,870
you know, Kiss. But I,

188
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,650
I was a little nervous that I was
maybe overboard with that. And,

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,990
and as soon as you start looking at it,

190
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,390
keeping things simple is a broad military
principle that's been around forever.

191
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,240
And there's a reason because it's true.
Next up,

192
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,590
unity of command,

193
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,000
unity of command is the
establishment of a single authority.

194
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,900
This is the best means of
ensuring unity of effort,

195
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:31,050
which implies a singleness of purpose
and cooperation by all elements of the

196
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:31,924
command.

197
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,730
That one seems obvious.

198
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:41,320
I'll tell you what prevents this from
happening. Most of the time it's ego.

199
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,100
Most of the time in the business
world, it's, no one wants to say, hey,

200
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,780
you know what?
We're putting this other guy in charge.

201
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,140
Give them the support that he needs most
of the time in the business world. Why?

202
00:12:51,141 --> 00:12:54,430
Like, you know, we don't want to make
Billy feel bad. So you know what?

203
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:57,490
You run this part of it and then you
run the other part of it and then,

204
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,770
and then Jennifer over here,
she can run the, so it's all,

205
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,440
it's actually all three of you are
going to coordinate together to, uh,

206
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,860
to make this happen. Well, who's
in charge? You're all in charge.

207
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,810
How's that workout?
Not Good.

208
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,430
The only way it works out good as if one
of those people or or two of the three

209
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:17,431
people are exquisite leaders with no
egos and can prop up the other person

210
00:13:17,501 --> 00:13:19,960
that's an egomaniac and make
them feel good and let it happen.

211
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,830
Otherwise it's going to be problematic.
You'd see this.

212
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:27,910
So in the military what they do is they
designate someone as the main effort.

213
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,490
So one,

214
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,230
one company or one battalion
will be designated, okay,

215
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,630
you're the main effort.
We're all here to support you.

216
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,190
That's it. That's something you
definitely have to be careful of.

217
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,520
And I'll tell you, I'll give you
a little hint, a little help.

218
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,010
The best way to do this is just to do it.
The best way to do it is be like, Hey,

219
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:55,030
you know what? I need one person running
this. So Billy, you got this one,

220
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,780
Jennifer, I'll probably give you the
next one, but Billy, you, you need to,

221
00:13:58,781 --> 00:13:59,890
you need to take command of this one.

222
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:03,160
I know you know this terrain a little
bit better. You run this one. Jennifer,

223
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:07,330
if we go over to your your market
area next time you'll be running it.

224
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,590
So do what you can to support Billy right
now cause you he'll be supporting you

225
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,160
in the future. Boom. Done
what we what people do.

226
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,510
They want to have the harder conversation.

227
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,100
They don't want to just tell Jennifer
that she needs to take the back seat on

228
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,600
this one.
That hurts too much.

229
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,210
So they put everyone in charge and
now you've got no one in charge.

230
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,180
Now you've got a disaster on your
hand. Unity of command. Yeah,

231
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,380
next mass

232
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,920
mass depends or sorry.

233
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:43,921
Mass demands that superiority of combat
power be attained at the critical time

234
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,720
and place for decisive purpose.

235
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:52,170
This superiority is both
qualitative and quantitative.

236
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,580
Combat power is primarily a
combination of firepower and maneuver,

237
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,050
which is applied at the right time,

238
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,910
at the right place for decisive purpose.
So what does this mean?

239
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,260
Focus your efforts. This means prioritize.
Next, execute. This is the same thing.

240
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,770
This is the same idea as
prioritize and execute,

241
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,330
which is pick where pick what the
biggest problem is and that's what you're

242
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:19,250
going to attack.
Focus your resources on it.

243
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,270
Back to the book.

244
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,900
The use of nuclear weapons by enemy
forces will require greater dispersion for

245
00:15:30,381 --> 00:15:32,120
passive defense.
Therefore,

246
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,570
a greater stress must be placed on the
application of mass from the point of

247
00:15:35,571 --> 00:15:38,180
view of time rather than space.

248
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:44,000
Violation of this principle exposes the
command to the risk of piecemeal defeat.

249
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,490
Even buy an inferior your enemy.

250
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,730
Let's hope we don't have nuclear war.

251
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,820
Next economy of force economy.
Oh,

252
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:04,880
before we get there mass.
Another.

253
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:09,881
Another way that this relates to Jujitsu
is that when you get an arm lock,

254
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,993
what are you doing?

255
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,870
You're focusing all your strength
on the one weak point of the enemy.

256
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,060
When you get to choke,
what are you doing?

257
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:21,140
You're focusing all your force on that
one weak point of the enemy, their neck,

258
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,600
you know, next number six,

259
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,980
economy of force.

260
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:34,030
Economy of force requires that sufficient
force be applied at other than the

261
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:39,311
decisive time and place to permit mass
to be applied at the point of decision.

262
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,690
These two principles,

263
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,490
economy of force and mass are so closely
related that they cannot be considered

264
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,520
singly application of the two principals
requires a sound estimate of what is

265
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:58,901
sufficient elsewhere to permit the
attainment of decisive superiority at the

266
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:02,720
decisive time and place.
Sufficient is the key.

267
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:08,350
It connotes the application
of force necessary to
accomplish the purpose and not

268
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:14,590
the application of as little force as
possible. So economy of forced, this is,

269
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,750
we heard a lot about this
in judo, right? When we,

270
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,910
when we talked about judo in depth,

271
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,060
it's all about economy of force.

272
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,720
That's sort of the
underlying principle of judo,

273
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,670
which therefore makes it one of the
underlying principles of Jujitsu depending

274
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,780
on what kind of game you got. That's
what it's going to say. I mean,

275
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,770
that's cool in theory,
but you know, again,

276
00:17:36,771 --> 00:17:39,800
on the mat it's not going to be like
that all the time. I mean, yeah,

277
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:41,310
if you can perfect it.
Good. So that's what,

278
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:45,850
there's some people that have the kind
of game where they're going to use an

279
00:17:45,851 --> 00:17:48,620
economy of force to their advantage
because they're going to wear the other

280
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:49,790
personnel.
Yeah,

281
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:54,660
I would say I actually do that.
I do that. I don't, I will,

282
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,930
I will allow people to move around and
get tired and that's sort of a good thing

283
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:04,830
for me to do. I don't do it all the time
and I can't do it to everyone. You know?

284
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:08,180
I can't, it's right now, I can't
really tie around Andy. He's, he's,

285
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,310
he's not getting tired right
now. And the, yeah, the um,

286
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,430
that's the general principle,
you know,

287
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:18,360
like it's just generally
that's what you're doing,

288
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:21,060
whether you're perfecting
it or not. Generally that's
what you're doing. So like,

289
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:23,490
you know, when you're a white
belt and someone mounts you,

290
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,690
or even if you mount somebody,

291
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,110
you're like going for stuff and you're
trying to get out immediately and all

292
00:18:28,111 --> 00:18:28,950
this stuff. Even though, Bro,

293
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,920
that's not the best time to get up and
you can kind of use timing. Actually,

294
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,760
I understand your point where they said,
okay,

295
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,300
the best time to get out is right
when they get through it. By the way,

296
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:43,780
that's the best time. That's the best
time to disrupt any situation. Yeah.

297
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,120
Like if you've got a situation
like a self defense situation,

298
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:51,360
you just disrupted immediately
as soon as it starts. Right.

299
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:54,420
And you just poke some, you know, stick
a pen in their eye and run away. Right?

300
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:57,720
You don't wait for them to grab you
and how you do. You don't do that.

301
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:01,050
An active shooter situation.
No, you don't think,

302
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,180
oh well I'm going to see
where this is going. No,

303
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:08,181
you immediately disrupted get out of there
as fast as you can wait around so you

304
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:11,810
don't let the enemy
settle in their position.

305
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,850
Because once they settle in
their position, they're there.

306
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,910
Now they can now focus on what's happening
because they're no longer having to

307
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,900
focus on settling. Right. They've,
they've established position. When you,

308
00:19:24,901 --> 00:19:28,710
when you were fighting against
an established position,
it's problematic for the,

309
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,980
and I guess, you know, maybe
it's little bit different,

310
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:35,850
but technically it's in the
transition space, isn't it? Transits.

311
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,570
The Dean does a really good
job of teaching where as
the person gets into their

312
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,780
final movement to get in position,

313
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,230
he teaches where the gaps are because
there are definite gaps there.

314
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,030
And in the middle of a term transition,
for example, that's, that's a huge gap.

315
00:19:54,031 --> 00:19:54,781
But in a way,

316
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,390
since they don't necessarily have
whatever the position they're going for,

317
00:19:57,391 --> 00:20:00,040
like the amount, for example in
the transition to the mountain,

318
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,310
they don't really have them out.
So that's a huge gap.

319
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,870
But it's not technically escaping them
out technically because they don't have

320
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,120
it.
When you go to the other side of that,

321
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:12,080
that transition still in the
transition though, maybe the site,

322
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,830
we'll call it the second
half of the transition.

323
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,290
It's be way before they settle for sure.
Yeah.

324
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,470
That's where it's going to be 100%
but when you're a white belt though,

325
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,310
let's say they, they settle in and you
don't want, someone gets like, okay,

326
00:20:23,311 --> 00:20:25,830
we're gonna use the mountain as the
example. The guys mounted right.

327
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:30,360
Hooks it or feed established and wait to
establish holy mountain, the mountain,

328
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,280
God established whatever. If you're
in a tournament, oh, and the early,

329
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,930
the earlier on you and you're just,

330
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,760
you're going to be trying to get out of
there. He immediately getting guns. Yeah.

331
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,220
And that's not economy of force right
there because it's like person is fully

332
00:20:44,221 --> 00:20:48,130
established. Yeah. In fact I'll
go ahead and tell you you're,

333
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,980
you're wasting energy. Exactly.
That person is fully established,

334
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,140
very lost your opportunity when,
during that transitional period. Right.

335
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,040
So the point there though is
indeed you too. The more you learn,

336
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:04,630
the more you kind of learn about Jujitsu,
the more you, you realize that yeah,

337
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,220
this, this, that's a general purpose.

338
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:09,160
Like your hold you get to game is
economy of force, right? Your whole game,

339
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,520
you're not going to perfect it every
single split second of the year you get to

340
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,090
know sometimes you'll even step outside
of the rule to make something specific

341
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,570
happen or when it's arts dean will
be like, oh that was a spazz defense.

342
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,680
Like I'll just could get nuts for a
few seconds because you, you know,

343
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,120
in hopes that a opening opens up and
oftentimes it does when you're stronger

344
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,740
than that guy for a second or whatever.

345
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:34,741
I condoning or encouraging the spazz
as the premier escape situation.

346
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,690
Cause it's not,
cause there's plenty of times,

347
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,180
especially against an unskilled
opponent, they can spousal, they want,

348
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:42,970
they're not going anywhere. Yes,
correct. Yeah, exactly. Right.

349
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,550
And now I got something,
you know, I talked to, uh,

350
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,510
I was talking to Dave Burke
about this good deal team

351
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,040
and from a leadership perspective,

352
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,840
there is also something very similar that
happens from a leadership perspective

353
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
as a leader, let's say, okay,

354
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,510
when you're a black belt or a brown belt,

355
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,890
you have someone that's
a white belt right there.

356
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,280
You're mounted on them and they're
grabbing whatever they're grabbing.

357
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:15,940
They're grabbing it with full,
like craziness.

358
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:18,250
They're grabbing your belt or they're,

359
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,370
or they're grabbing your sleeve like
as hard as they possibly can or they're

360
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:24,100
grabbing your neck. It
is no factor, right?

361
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:29,130
I mean it's literally no factor to you
if you make it a factor that me just

362
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:32,500
means you're not experienced enough.
That means you, if you're only,

363
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,730
if you're only an a blue belt and you're
going against a lower blue belt and you

364
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:39,250
might start getting concerned about this,
but when you're a black belt,

365
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,270
you're like, oh, this doesn't matter.
From a leadership perspective,

366
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,830
there's things that are
going on with your team,

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,360
with individuals on your team.

368
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,710
And if you don't know what you're doing,

369
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,970
you're concerned about them and they
freak you out and they make you react.

370
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,290
And yet if you're a black belt,
these things happen and you just,

371
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,360
you just realize what they are.

372
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,570
It's just wasted energy for them and
it's going to have no impact on longterm

373
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,650
deal that you're, you know,
where you're going. So it's a,

374
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,680
it's a clear indicator to me when I'm
working with a leader and they're spun up

375
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:22,240
about little things, I, for some reason,

376
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:24,920
I always think of like they're spun
up that the person's grabbing their,

377
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:28,600
their belt, right? You're mounted on
them and they're grabbing your belt,

378
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,670
like they're gonna do something with it.
They can't do anything.

379
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,300
That happens all the time. From a
leadership perspective, someone, you know,

380
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:37,510
some of your subordinates or scope
doing something crazy, it's like, okay,

381
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,120
does it really matter?
Most of the time it doesn't even matter.

382
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,600
Occasionally you've got to address
it. Like if a guy, if your guys,

383
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,160
if you're mounted on a guy
and starts to lift your knee,

384
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,100
you reached down and address it.
No big deal. You don't panic.

385
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,410
You don't give up the mount. Yeah,
you just address it and then you,

386
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,560
you take it back to normal. So as a,
and what this has to do with really is,

387
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:02,360
has to do with detachment because you,
if you're detached,

388
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,390
you'll see that whatever the situation
is is not that big of a deal.

389
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,630
But when you're all up in the fight and
they're grabbing your belt or grabbing

390
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:09,650
your sleeve and you're freaking out,

391
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,520
you're not doing a good job of
detachment at all. Feels like, right?

392
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,180
I don't know what it is. I don't feel
right about it. I see it all the time.

393
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:25,070
And by the way, here's another important
piece. If they're doing something,

394
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:30,071
if they're grabbing your sleeve and
now you expend energy to stop that,

395
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,910
well, you're expending energy. You're not
following the idea of economy of force.

396
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,880
And what you're also doing is
you're giving up leadership
capital because you're

397
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:40,610
wasting time trying to stop them from
doing something that doesn't even matter.

398
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,020
So why are you worried about that? Let
that thing go. Just let that thing go.

399
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,340
Focus on the wrong thing. Yes, yes. Yeah.

400
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,610
In one when I was a bouncer, they,
this was part of the training,

401
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,370
but they did call it minimum. The
minimum minimum of course. Yeah.

402
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,270
Which kind of when you're training
could kind of, it's kind of like,

403
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:02,470
especially if you've been in like
breaking up like a significant fights

404
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:07,070
situation, you start telling me I
gotta use minimum, it just sounds off.

405
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:10,310
I know what they mean and this is what
they mean right here is sufficient.

406
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,600
They made sufficient. They basically do,
they don't want you over doing it. Yeah,

407
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,670
they do mean they do mean minimum,

408
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,160
but they also mean
sufficient cause the minimum,

409
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,580
well if you use the minimum
force required and it works,

410
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:26,660
then that was sufficient. Yeah. Yeah. And
I, and I understood it when they said it.

411
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:30,030
Of course like it's a one, one we're
not in the situation and like, yeah,

412
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,510
that's true.
We'll use it.

413
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,070
Just I like how they use sufficient
though because it one one you hear like

414
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:41,120
especially if you're talking about
warfare or in my case bouncing when you're

415
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:45,410
breaking up guys fighting with you know,
bottles or whatever and they're saying,

416
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:49,210
hey, use the minimum. You're like,
no man, we're going in there.

417
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,120
We get it done as quick as we can.
But the thing is it's like no Bruh.

418
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,450
Like you're not to use maximum.
Yeah, you're not going in
there swinging punches,

419
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,040
you're breaking it up,
you know kind of thing.

420
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:01,310
And it makes sense because guys will
do that. They'll be like, well you're,

421
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,900
you know,
kind of thing.

422
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,720
And then they'll like injure somebody
or something like that when they don't

423
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:09,290
have to. Yeah. Not Good. And
then efficient. Sufficient,

424
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,460
sufficient force check. Alright. Next

425
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,973
maneuver.

426
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,840
Maneuver requires that all military
resources be brought to bear in the

427
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:24,230
accomplishment of the objective.
Correct.

428
00:26:24,231 --> 00:26:28,250
Application of the principle of maneuver
requires not only the full use of

429
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:30,740
combat power at the
decisive time and place,

430
00:26:30,741 --> 00:26:34,400
but includes the movements
of elements of combat power,

431
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,540
including combat service support
to the area of operations.

432
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,490
That's pretty straight forward.

433
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,160
You have to move your people
in the right positions,

434
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,910
including the support people that need
to get there to keep the logistics lines

435
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:50,730
open, to keep the intelligence flowing,
to keep the radio is working on all that

436
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,650
application of this principle is a
function of command at all levels.

437
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,180
At the highest level,

438
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,040
it usually means the movement of men means
and supplies to an area of operations

439
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:06,570
and at the lowest level it means the
positioning of troop units and fires to

440
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:11,300
destroy the enemy
straightforward.

441
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,210
That's what that one is
next.

442
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:21,130
Surprise. Surprised connotes
striking the enemy when,

443
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,000
where or in such a manner that he
is unable to counter effectively.

444
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,320
The achievement of surprise is not
necessarily dependent upon misleading the

445
00:27:29,321 --> 00:27:32,530
enemy as to intentions such as,
for example,

446
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:34,990
concealing from him an
intention of attacking.

447
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,710
He may know from the situation
that he will be attacked.

448
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,030
Yet the attacker may achieve surprise
by the time place, direction,

449
00:27:43,031 --> 00:27:46,690
size or composition of
forces or tactics employed.

450
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,970
Yeah, that one's pretty straightforward.
That one's pretty straight forward.

451
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:59,380
That's the, that's the difference
really. That's the difference.

452
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:05,140
That's one of the differences between
like a white belt and a blue belt.

453
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,540
I mean it's actually, it's,
it's not even two blue belt yet.

454
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,030
You've got to be able
to surprise the person.

455
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,530
They can't know what's coming in Jiu
Jitsu if they know what's coming and they

456
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:16,600
know any Jujitsu that are
going to defend that thing.

457
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,650
So surprise comes when you are baiting
him with one thing and you hit him with

458
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:23,500
something else. And when for I've
told them, I told you that story.

459
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:26,080
Like when the first,
when I was like a white belt,

460
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,240
I'd probably been trained
in for like four weeks.

461
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:33,670
And this seal buddy of mine who had been
training for a while but kind of off

462
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,504
and on and,

463
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:39,310
and he was a friend of mine and as
soon as I was training for like a week,

464
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,940
I was like, hey, let's train incident.
So I was kind of roughing him up. Right.

465
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,220
Cause he, he's training off and
on and, but he's a good dude.

466
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,510
He's a great dude. And I said to him, so
after like three weeks, I said to him,

467
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:56,140
you don't, here's the thing in
Jujitsu, you can't just do one move.

468
00:28:56,141 --> 00:29:00,790
You gotta like set it up with something
else. And the next time we were old,

469
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,200
he was going for a choke hard
on me. And I was like, dude,

470
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,820
this guy's man, I don't want to talk
to this guy. I can't let them. Boom,

471
00:29:09,821 --> 00:29:13,640
here are mocked me. And
I was like, whoa. Yeah,

472
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,170
yeah. And I, that was the
last time that happened.

473
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,760
You didn't like that was
awesome. Was, he took just,

474
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:26,761
he took just my words of
what I told him and this,

475
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:29,230
this guy's a frigging awesome seal.

476
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,820
He took just my words of what I told them
and apply them to what he already knew

477
00:29:33,821 --> 00:29:37,050
physically about how to do a
choke and how to do normac. Yeah.

478
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,250
And he'd are mocked me. Yeah. Yes.

479
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,880
Surprise,
surprise.

480
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,450
You go through these just kind of
naturally too, because they're like,

481
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:50,890
since they're grappling movements,

482
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:54,100
like unless you're one of these
super duper quick guys, you know,

483
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,870
like everything's going to
be more or less telegraph.

484
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:59,170
Do you know if like if
I say, Hey Jocko, um,

485
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,960
if I know you love the arm lock
and you don't go for arm locks,

486
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,590
I know that's coming. Yes
and no. I, I agree with you.

487
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,140
There's sometimes when I submit people,

488
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,010
when they'd completely know that
it's coming and they can't stop it,

489
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,360
Dean does that to me where it's like
he's getting an arm lock and I can't stop

490
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:20,380
him. He couldn't say like, here it comes.
And I'm like, oh, I know it's coming.

491
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:23,590
I can feel it coming. I can feel
it and I can't stop it. Yeah,

492
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,380
but here's the thing about that
technique too. That's like their will.

493
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,790
There's two elements that go on in
here. One, there's like, Okay Dean,

494
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:33,220
cause we talked about this before. Well
Dean, he's going to say, Okay Dean,

495
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:38,030
I'm a thing that the surprise
came earlier. Yes. Position.

496
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,400
We're not either he was ahead of you
now or he's in a position where all your

497
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:45,610
defenses that he knows have to
comfort for you to stop him.

498
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,050
He knows the defense and all that.

499
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:51,310
He put himself early on into a position
where he can shut down those differences

500
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,720
before to the point of this,
he did through surprise,

501
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,720
there's some little movement and all
of a sudden he's mounted with my arm

502
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,470
exposed and now I know how to
get our unlocked. I kick it,

503
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:03,490
kick it out of exactly right.
But

504
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,940
sometimes so,

505
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
but so sometimes you do submit people
like that where they know it's coming,

506
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,720
but you're right.

507
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,690
You got to get that surprise movement
to get insufficient in position.

508
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,690
And they're also, the
second part is, uh, Mike,

509
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,470
like little for lack of better term
Mike Crow surprises. So it's like,

510
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,491
you know how it's like,
Hey,

511
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:23,830
I'm going to go for this arm lock
and I know your arm luck is coming.

512
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:26,140
But just even for like a
half a second split second,

513
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,040
I'm going to like tip you off balance and
just for that split second you're like,

514
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,450
oh, your mind goes okay, are you just
your body reaction? Like your reaction.

515
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,570
Oh I gotta put my, you know, you know that
it's like our early movie learn and um,

516
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,480
Akbar used to do this all the time where,
you know,

517
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,890
the setup sweep from the card sit up
suite for the guard and when you base you

518
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:46,180
go straight,
you go back to the triangle.

519
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,700
That's what cause two to
basically put your arm down.

520
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,950
You can get your leg over like that.
For example,

521
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,340
like if someone likes to do triangle,

522
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,940
Jill tutor used to do that stuff to me
all the time because he liked to triangle

523
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,990
and yet he do these little things that
you got to put your arm down just real

524
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:00,940
quick. Even if you're like,
yeah, just real quick,

525
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:03,250
I'll just put it down real quick to base
or whatever and I'll put it right back

526
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:06,580
into the defensive position. Like
Bra. That's a little micro surprise.

527
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:09,790
Even though you weren't dressed in the
dark the whole time and where did that

528
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:11,260
triangle come from?
It's not that,

529
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:15,520
it was just for that little little
split second he split second surprise.

530
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,910
It's a surprise that works.
Hey, back to this, um,

531
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:23,290
maneuver like I feel like that's like,
and I learned this from you,

532
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,780
where put simply you say,
hey,

533
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:29,170
build the relationship with
people. Like you're like, Hey,

534
00:32:29,171 --> 00:32:33,910
my boss won't listen to my input
or my coworker won't, you know,

535
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:37,600
listen to my, my strategy, which is
awesome. And all this stuff. You're like,

536
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:40,010
hey cause you're just going
to straight. You got to, you

537
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,790
got to create a relationship. You've
got to get into the position. You know,

538
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,300
I just got this question today, I was
getting interviewed and the guy's like,

539
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,260
you know, that guy's like, well, I mean,

540
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:55,100
what happens when I even see it's already,
it's like, it's like when someone says,

541
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,860
well, you know, it's like in Jiu
Jitsu when someone says, well,

542
00:32:56,861 --> 00:33:00,620
you know what it was the guy does this and
say, well, yeah, so the guy says, well,

543
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:05,621
you know what happens if you get told to
do something by your boss and you don't

544
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:10,700
agree with it? And he just
says, do it my way anyways.

545
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,020
Right. And I'm like, well, I don't
get in situations like that. Why?

546
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:17,330
Because I've spent the last six months,
eight months,

547
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:20,990
one year building a relationship up with
my boss where my boss tells me to do

548
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:22,700
something that I don't believe
it. And I say, Hey boss,

549
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,100
I don't know if this is a good idea.
How about we do this a different way?

550
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:27,160
My boss says, oh, thank you John.

551
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:30,740
Thank you for not allowing me to tell you
to do something. It doesn't make sense.

552
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,830
Yeah. So you're right, it's a preemptive,

553
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,520
a preemptive maneuver to be in the right
position so that you will not get told

554
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:40,431
to do something.
Now,

555
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:44,360
does that mean I haven't done a bunch of
things that I didn't want to do leading

556
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:47,420
up to that point? Yes, absolutely. That's
called building leadership capital.

557
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:50,630
I'm going to make my boss when
over and over and over again.

558
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,890
No one wants to hear that.

559
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,170
I just got to when when Lafe and I were
out in Staten Island guys like, you know,

560
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:02,150
what can I do to lead people that
are that debt don't want to do,

561
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:03,830
you know, do what I want
him to do. Tech man,

562
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,840
you got to build relationships with those
guys. You can't bark orders at them.

563
00:34:06,841 --> 00:34:10,880
It's not going to help. It'll help for a
minute. Like they'll load that truck up,

564
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,750
but they're looking for another job.
You know what I mean?

565
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:17,630
You've got to build relationships with
these people up and down the chain of

566
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:22,550
command and you know what that is? That's
maneuvering. You are correct. Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,970
I thought that was critical or critical.
Yeah.

568
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:30,200
But really helpful because again, that's
one of those things where you gotta do,

569
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,800
you got to detach, you've got to, you got
to kind of step outside and be like, hey,

570
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:38,030
cause that okay to build a relationship
with your boss, no one thinks like that.

571
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:41,930
That's the solution to the problem because
directly it's kind of not even though

572
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,940
a huge, huge, yeah. Why would
you say it directly? It's not,

573
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:50,420
cause it's straight up is, well it
doesn't seem like it put it that way.

574
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,560
Well if you just think kind of, I don't
know, for lack of a better term, linearly,

575
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,310
like if I'm like, Hey, I want
Jocko to loosen to my input, right.

576
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:00,920
A direct approach to would be like,
hey Joe, go take your headphones off.

577
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:05,090
Listen to my input. That's like a
direct, so if I go indirect, right,

578
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,380
that's more like, hey, I got to build
a relationship first, then I can,

579
00:35:09,381 --> 00:35:11,300
it's basically adding another step.

580
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:14,620
But that step is like this
straight up requirement and, and,

581
00:35:14,621 --> 00:35:17,780
and the thing is this,
it's not a step,

582
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:23,290
it's a broad underlying fundamental
situation that you set up for success.

583
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,670
Yeah.
And,

584
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,860
and then there's this whole thought that,
cause I,

585
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,870
and I've said this on here many
times to say it all the time,

586
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,950
I built relationships with bosses
that I didn't like. Right. And People,

587
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,970
oh well Jockos at an ass kisser.
Yeah.

588
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,170
And Jack was a brown noser cause he just
tried to build a relationship with his

589
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:45,990
boss. And I always say, no,

590
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:50,190
I'm not a brown noser a known on an ass
kisser. I'm winning. I'm here to win.

591
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,020
That's what I'm here to do.
If you know what I'm here to do,

592
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,710
take care of my platoon and make sure
that they can have what they need to

593
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:58,410
accomplish our mission to the
best of our ability. If my,

594
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,800
if I have an antagonistic
relationship with my boss,

595
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,120
can I truly support my platoon?
The answer is no. All Day long.

596
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,340
He's not going to give me the gear
that we need because he's unlike me.

597
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,560
He's not going to give me the training
that I need because he doesn't like me.

598
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,080
So why is he going to give me what I need?
He's not.

599
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,660
But if I have a good relationship
with them that I built,

600
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:18,330
then guess what he's gonna do.

601
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,590
He's gonna let give me what I need to
accomplish my mission and he's going to

602
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,190
give me what I need to be the most
effective platoon we can have.

603
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,360
Now where does it cross the
line? Where does, where does,

604
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,540
where does Jocko become a
brown noser and an ass kisser.

605
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:36,540
Cause we know these people exist and
I'll tell you exactly where the line gets

606
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:37,140
crossed.

607
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,140
The line gets crossed where I'm kissing
my boss his ass so that I can get

608
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,430
promoted or I can get taken care of her.

609
00:36:44,431 --> 00:36:47,880
I can take care of myself if
that's what game you're in. Yes,

610
00:36:47,881 --> 00:36:50,970
you're an ass kisser. I don't like
you because you're doing it for you.

611
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,180
It's like the difference between
manipulation and leadership, right?

612
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,920
If you're doing,
if you're,

613
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:59,160
if you're influencing people so that
they do something that's gonna help the

614
00:36:59,161 --> 00:37:02,100
team and help the mission and help them,
that's influence.

615
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,420
If you're doing something, if you're
influencing or that's leadership,

616
00:37:06,421 --> 00:37:11,421
if you're influencing people so that you
can help yourself and benefit yourself.

617
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,880
That's, and it doesn't help the team and
it doesn't help to mention that's the

618
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:18,310
manipulation leash.
Yeah. Yeah. Fully. Yeah.

619
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,540
And when you go outside of the scope
of like the broad goal, you know,

620
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:25,440
and I can see it by the way everyone,
everyone can see it.

621
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,520
Everyone can see it.
Yeah. Everyone can see it.

622
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,640
And what's really jacked up or,
and it's not even jacked up.

623
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:38,030
What's kind of cool is if you're looking
out for the boys and you're looking out

624
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:41,940
for the mission and you're
doing everything for their,
for their, for the best,

625
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,850
for their best, that
shows through to, yeah.

626
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,490
And when that shows through,
guess what your people,

627
00:37:50,491 --> 00:37:54,620
your boss wants to take care of you. Cause
you're trying to win for him, you know,

628
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,910
not for you. So yeah,
but the way you say it,

629
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,020
I mean obviously you're, you're, you're
not new to this concept, but you know,

630
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:08,370
and you're not new to the concept of one
year in the situation if you don't like

631
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:08,910
the person.

632
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,600
And now Jocko wants me to build a good
relationship with this person that I

633
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:17,590
don't like or whatever. But I'm not
keeping it real. That's what it's like,

634
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,160
what it be like this to face guy.

635
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:24,480
You think I'm going to be give
him my respect, my valued,

636
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:28,380
coveted respect and man,
that's, I'm, I keep it real.

637
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:30,530
I keep it to reel to reel for that.
I'm not gay.

638
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:33,920
I'm not bowing down to that guy can do
it. Cool, so you're going loose. Yeah.

639
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,100
So you'd rather lose. Yeah. See, but when

640
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,400
you put it into perspective again, that
perspective that you put it in, which is,

641
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,650
which I did, what's, what's,
what's interesting just to,

642
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:44,620
just to take that to one more level.
If you're the guy that's like, Hey,

643
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:46,840
I've got too much pride to do that,
I'm not doing that.

644
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:50,080
I'm not bowing down to him.
Okay, so you're going to
lose. Because to me, I look,

645
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:53,200
I don't just look at it like one hit.
That's the end of the game.

646
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:57,610
The game doesn't end there. The game
ends when I'm on top with the big win.

647
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,860
And you know what?
My Ego,

648
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,920
my ego won't allow me to let
my ego interfere with the
fact that I want to win a

649
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:09,550
big game. The long game, I
play the long game in this one.

650
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,620
In all of them maneuver. Yeah.
A little bit of maneuver.

651
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:19,060
Maneuver. Yeah. If he can get into
a habit like you kind of nuts.

652
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,630
You surprised straight up surprises
me because I forgot by the way,

653
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,450
cause it's not as,

654
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,160
doesn't come as natural with one of your
answers at roll call when you were like,

655
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:31,950
hey, build a relationship. Oh like you're,
you know this person is when you know,

656
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,500
you remember the situation and the person
didn't like you didn't follow through

657
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,550
as much as he should have.

658
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:39,160
And because he's so good you can't
tell him anything kind of thing.

659
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:42,580
And then it's like, no, you gotta
you can't like harp on this guy.

660
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:45,220
You got to build a relationship with him.
I was like Aww Dang.

661
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,060
Cause that's a lot.
Most of the time that's the answer.

662
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,580
If you ever have a problem with
somebody like not doing it, you know,

663
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:54,400
like just like I said,
most of the time,

664
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,590
most of the time what
people think they should do.

665
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:01,600
How should I confront this person? Should
I care them to do what I wanted to do?

666
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,460
How can I confront them? Should
I fire them? Which it's like, oh,

667
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,820
you know what you should do?
Build a relationship with
them. Make them understand.

668
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,980
Make you understand where
they're coming from.

669
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:15,280
Can you lead someone that
you don't understand? Not
really. Here's another one.

670
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,350
You get someone if, if you're, oh, oh,

671
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,970
this person that works for me, thanks.
It's all about him. What should I do?

672
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:29,440
You should make them think it's that
everything's about him. Yeah. That's the,

673
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:33,160
that's the black belt. The black belt
movies like, yeah, you're damn right.

674
00:40:33,161 --> 00:40:36,070
This is all about you and here's how
you're going to win. And by the way,

675
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:37,450
the whole team's going to be
winning because you're winning,

676
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:41,890
but we don't worry about
that. We're worried about if
your perception is that, oh,

677
00:40:41,891 --> 00:40:43,900
echo, echo thinks this is
all about him, guess what?

678
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,040
I'm going to make echo think he's writes
and he's going to be busting his ass

679
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,640
cause it's all about him and the team
is going to echo is going to win,

680
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,400
which means the team's going to win,
which means I'm going to win. Yeah,

681
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,920
it's a no brainer. All you gotta do is
step back six to eight inches from the,

682
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:04,510
from the, from the front line to take
a look around and see that pretty far,

683
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:06,850
six to eight inches. When you need
to know this is the other thing.

684
00:41:06,851 --> 00:41:10,150
No one wants to hear those answers. No,
no they don't. I shouldn't say no one,

685
00:41:10,151 --> 00:41:12,100
but most people don't want
to hear those answers. Yeah,

686
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:17,170
because the fact of the matter is is it's
your fault. Yeah, it does. When your,

687
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:20,980
when your person is not doing what they're
supposed to be doing, it's your fault.

688
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,550
Hey,

689
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,150
do you get the person that just has a
totally negative attitude that shouldn't

690
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:28,240
be on the team? Yes,
they exist. I get that.

691
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,510
Whose responsibility is it to get rid of
them? You get two years here, the boss,

692
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,550
if they're not that person,
whose responsibility

693
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,000
is it to get everything you can out of
them? It's you. You're the boss. Yeah.

694
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,180
People don't like to hear that answer.
No.

695
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,820
It's a hard answer because you
want to throw whatever you know,

696
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,020
all the millennials, the big
one, right? The millennials are,

697
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,690
oh,
well,

698
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,130
maybe if maybe if maybe if
you were a better leader,

699
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,320
the millennials would be on board.

700
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,070
It's a hard thing to face,

701
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,400
but if David Hackworth and Jim Mooky Yama
can get draftees in Vietnam to go and

702
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:12,230
risk their lives and fight the enemy and
possibly get wounded or killed in a war,

703
00:42:12,231 --> 00:42:16,610
they don't believe in. If they can
do that through good leadership,

704
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:20,660
I think you can get a millennial to
get get after it, and by the way,

705
00:42:20,661 --> 00:42:24,550
there's millennials getting after it
everywhere. I meet him all the time. Yeah.

706
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
They're not like, Hey, I did.
Hey, it's good to meet you.

707
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,940
I'm glad you're putting out word about
how to be lazy. No. They're like,

708
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,000
I am going to crush the world.
They're out there. Yeah.

709
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,080
It takes a little bit. Yeah. What
it takes, it takes leadership.

710
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:43,120
That's what it takes. I'm sorry.
Leadership is not easy to people do.

711
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,890
The millennials don't want to listen.
Who wants to listen?

712
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,010
I was more rebellious than
any millennial off Matt.

713
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,173
Hmm.

714
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,090
Let's see. Anyways, so

715
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,663
next

716
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:03,530
security security provides readiness for
action or counteraction and is enhanced

717
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:09,600
greatly by flexibility.
Flexibility in mind,

718
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,260
organization and means
contributes to security.

719
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,140
It's attainment embraces all measures
designed to avoid being surprised or

720
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:23,340
interfered with seriously.
And the retention of freedom of action.

721
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:29,160
Security is not imply.
Undo caution and avoidance of all risks.

722
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,360
Important security does
not imply undo caution.

723
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,040
So there's a dichotomy here.

724
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:41,030
It doesn't imply the avoidance of all
risks for bold action is essential to

725
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:45,090
success in war. And what does bold
action requires? Requires risks.

726
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:48,360
Otherwise it wouldn't be bold
when security is provided.

727
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:53,370
Unexpected developments will not seriously
interfere with the attainment of the

728
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:57,330
mission check.
So I've got to maintain security.

729
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:59,960
That makes sense.
So those are the nine principles.

730
00:43:59,961 --> 00:44:03,240
This is the nine principles of
war. That's as they existed. Now

731
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,960
they also talk about,

732
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:11,910
and there's a debate right
now going around of weather,

733
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,730
weather flexibility should
be the 10th principle.

734
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:18,730
Some people think it should,
some people think it shouldn't.

735
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:24,390
And then in 2011 they added
some principles to joint
operations and here are

736
00:44:27,841 --> 00:44:32,030
those principles.
Number one is restraint to limit,

737
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,890
correct collateral damage and
prevent unnecessary use of force.

738
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,290
So now we're getting into
the minimum force, right?

739
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,190
Restraint requires careful and disciplined
balancing of the need for security,

740
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,270
the conduct of military operations
and the national strategic end state.

741
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,310
Make sense?
That's where they came up with us.

742
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:54,570
You have to put that minimum force. That's
what that is. That's the same thing.

743
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,680
Right.
And I think the key to that,

744
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,970
they put on the end, the
national strategic end state.
So what does that mean?

745
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,240
Sometimes if you use too much violence,

746
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,700
if you as a bouncer use too much violence,
you're,

747
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,790
your goal of your mission is a
bouncers to keep the place safe. Yeah.

748
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,310
If you use too much violence,

749
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:17,370
people don't want to go there cause the
bouncers are, are, are assholes, right?

750
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:19,730
They're beating everyone
up. That's a problem. Yeah.

751
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,920
So what's our strategic end state
is that we keep this place safe.

752
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,490
So that's why they,
they're talking about that same situation.

753
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,820
They actually changed our name from
bouncers to, uh, fursuits host.

754
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:33,530
Wait, Whoa, whoa. They call it there.

755
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:38,200
You're not bounces your hosts and then
with the change it to a door host. No, no,

756
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:40,380
no. Okay. They went, bounces the
to know you're a doormat. No,

757
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,060
you're just adore the
dormant and they're like,

758
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:47,061
no door hosts fits like the
personification of this place.

759
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,930
You know, like you're just,
yeah, that was a good trial.

760
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,360
It's interesting. Yeah.
It's interesting though,

761
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:57,540
because that's a little leadership
maneuver that they're doing.

762
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,140
They're trying to, they didn't do a
good job because you're joking about it.

763
00:46:01,141 --> 00:46:03,990
Right. You thought it was a joke. He
liked us and ridiculous. The thing is,

764
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:06,420
I actually wasn't men and it ultimately,
I was like that.

765
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:10,050
That totally makes sense because when you
think bouncer, you think dive bar guys,

766
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,950
beating up guy, you know, bouncing
these guys out the on off the wall.

767
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:18,670
I'd roadhouse talks about
minimum force though, right?
And boy. Yeah. Dalton. Well,

768
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,660
what does he say? He said be nice.
Oh, that's like the rule, right?

769
00:46:22,661 --> 00:46:27,510
He nice and he's like, uh, ask him to
walk, but be nice if he doesn't walk,

770
00:46:27,511 --> 00:46:31,860
walk him. But be nice if
he, if he still won't walk,

771
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:36,900
get another guy to help you walk
him and you will both be nice.

772
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:40,720
And he said you be nice until
it's time to not be nice. Oh,

773
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:44,530
that's super bad ass. Right. Good.

774
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:49,820
Hold it back. You're good. All their
back. Right. That's like the, the,

775
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,390
the to hold it back.
That smile like the Bio,

776
00:46:54,391 --> 00:46:57,050
what do you call it? Not The Bible,
but the movie version of the,

777
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,640
you know how you have like what do,
what's the navy seal movie?

778
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,100
But when you got to, you know, for,
for pilots it's top gun. You know,

779
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:06,840
if there's a seal on the one
with Charlie Sheen. Yeah.

780
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:09,900
But I don't even know if that's
the iconic, not as iconic

781
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,810
as roadhouse. If you're a bouncer and
you watch in front of, that's your thing.

782
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,340
Yeah, for sure. No, it's the
iconic belter I don't even,

783
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,270
is there even another bouncer movie?
I don't know.

784
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:26,400
Shouldn't be as it doesn't even
exist. Nope. Exactly right.

785
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,250
Check.
All

786
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,140
right. Next. This is one of the new
ones. One of the new principals.

787
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,131
Perseverance.

788
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:41,131
To ensure the commitment necessary to
retain the national strategic end state.

789
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,010
The underlying causes of
the crisis may be elusive,

790
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:48,550
making it difficult to
achieve decisive resolution.

791
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,530
The patient resolute and persistent
pursuit of national goals and objectives

792
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,680
often is essential to success.

793
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,890
What I don't like about that one

794
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,720
is it it, it, it kind of,

795
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,630
it kind of says it's, it's
saying like, well, what's the
number one rule objective?

796
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,700
Like you've got to know what your
mission is. You got to have an objective,

797
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:14,380
and this one is saying,
look,

798
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:18,130
the underlying causes can be elusive.

799
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:22,600
It can be difficult to achieve
decisive resolution. So

800
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,790
I guess the theory or the principle
of perseverance means we're going to

801
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:29,260
continue to do this.

802
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,700
My problem with that is that is how do
you end up then or do you end up then

803
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:34,720
with a Vietnam,

804
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,670
we're continuing to fight
even though we're not quite
sure what our end state is,

805
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:42,670
what our objective is and it's so
elusive that we're not sure where to go.

806
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,840
That one makes me a little bit hesitant.

807
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,450
Do I believe in perseverance?
Absolutely. You keep going,

808
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,780
but as I've talked about before,
don't quit.

809
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,070
Doesn't mean never give up on the the
plan that you came up with and just keep

810
00:48:57,071 --> 00:49:00,970
going until you freaking either
die or you achieve your goal. Yeah.

811
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:09,460
Next legitimacy to maintain legal
and moral authority in the conduct of

812
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:12,800
operations legitimacy,

813
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:17,450
which can be a decisive factor in
operations is based on the actual and

814
00:49:17,451 --> 00:49:19,010
perceived legality,

815
00:49:19,011 --> 00:49:22,790
morality and rightness of the actions
from the various perspectives of

816
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:26,270
perspectives of interested
audiences together.

817
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,020
These 12 concepts form
principles of joint operations.

818
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,610
Now I'll tell you what's
interesting about legitimacy.

819
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,050
Obviously you have to have it.
You have to have, you know,

820
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,240
moral and legal authority.
The Prom I,

821
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:45,230
the problem I have with that
is who gets to judge that?

822
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,120
Because the per the people
that you're fighting,

823
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,260
they don't agree with what you're doing.
You're not legitimate in their eyes.

824
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,760
So how were we coming up with
that? I think, I think we can,

825
00:49:56,210 --> 00:50:01,190
but I think we have to do
that decisively and say,

826
00:50:01,191 --> 00:50:05,180
look, this is what we're
trying to achieve. This is why.

827
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,660
And if there's a bunch of
people debating about it, okay,

828
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:12,080
well we're going to hold off then
until someone says, oh, you know what?

829
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,060
This needs to be stopped.

830
00:50:14,061 --> 00:50:18,320
Or the situation situation needs to end
because you do need legitimacy and if

831
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:21,380
you don't have legitimacy,
you're going to have problems really,

832
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,270
truly accomplishing the mission. Yeah.
Yeah. And I mean kind of in a way, I mean,

833
00:50:26,271 --> 00:50:27,650
I'm sure there's obviously,

834
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:32,540
but in a way there's always going
to be like some deep date. You know,

835
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,990
how like, they'll be like, hey, you know,
I'm going to make a generic example,

836
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,860
but like you,
you know,

837
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,680
if they some turmoil in this country
because of the way these people are

838
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:41,930
treating these other people
in this country, right? Boom,

839
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:46,610
US steps in and all this
stuff. Some, there's going
to be somebody debating, hey,

840
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,160
like that's their country.
That's how they roll. You know?

841
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:52,190
It's like who are we to step
in and call them, you know,

842
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:55,970
immoral or whatever when that's how
they'd been living for thousands of years.

843
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,180
Yeah. That's my point. So yeah. Who
gets to make his decision? Yeah.

844
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,050
Well it's a tough one.
Yeah. Like almost like a,

845
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:07,140
like a global standard needs
to be established, you know?

846
00:51:07,141 --> 00:51:09,390
And I think that's kind of the end.
And I think you,

847
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:12,080
I think it is actually possible
to do that. I think so too.

848
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,400
I think it is actually
possible to do that.

849
00:51:13,401 --> 00:51:16,070
And I think the fact that we
sometimes decide that, hey,

850
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:19,820
it's not our place to make that decision.
Like I'll give you an example.

851
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,460
Isis,
hey,

852
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,320
if you're systematically
raping eight year old,

853
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,160
nine year old,
10 year old girls and boys,

854
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,190
you don't get to do that. Right?
We will come and stop you. Yeah.

855
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:38,060
That's the way it's going
to be. Yeah. And you need,

856
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:42,260
if you need a documented argument
for why that is, I think,

857
00:51:42,261 --> 00:51:44,540
I don't think that'd be
a problem to produce.

858
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:48,260
I think if you need a
documented argument for that,

859
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,070
you just made the list as well.
We're coming after you.

860
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:56,240
I think I agree with you sir.
So yeah,

861
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,670
Nazis,
guess what?

862
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You don't get to do that same dealio
imperial Japanese army rolling into China.

863
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:08,450
Rape of Nan King. Nope. You don't
get to do that. That doesn't work.

864
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,180
We're not okay with that.
You just made the list.

865
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,770
We seem to have a harder time doing that.

866
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,780
We seem to think these days that evil
doesn't exist. Yeah, and that's wrong.

867
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,970
It's wrong.
Next,

868
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,420
next it talks about the application
of the principles application,

869
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:33,290
the principles of war. So that's, that's
the, well, it's now the 12 principles,

870
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:38,320
but now I'm going from the new principals
that were added on back to the 1984

871
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:45,370
Marine Corps Field Manual
Fmfm six TAC for rifle company

872
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,351
application.

873
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:53,300
The principles of war act as a checklist
for the commander in order to apply

874
00:52:53,301 --> 00:52:56,930
combat power effectively and
reduce his units of vulnerability.

875
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:02,110
A review of military history will
demonstrate that those commanders who have

876
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:07,400
adhered to those principles have most
often enjoyed success on the battlefield.

877
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:08,743
There you go.

878
00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:14,330
I like the fact that they're taking these
principles and broadly applying them

879
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:16,970
to the past and saying,
look, when this happened,

880
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:19,910
historically you will have victory.
Most of the time

881
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,150
there have been, of course,
exceptions to the rule. However,

882
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:32,151
these exceptions prove the rule that
any attempt to rigidly apply all the

883
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:36,870
principles to all battlefield
environments may lead to defeat.

884
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,910
We got to, we got a little chapter
in the dichotomy of leadership.

885
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,840
It's called disciplined,
not rigid. Yeah. Why?

886
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,730
Because of what that just said.

887
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,330
The commander should recognize the need
to apply the principles as flexibility

888
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,530
as all other tactical
principles, oh, sorry.

889
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:03,531
As flexibly as all other tactical
principles based on the circumstances with

890
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:06,030
which he is confronted,

891
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:11,280
flexibility in the application
of principles is as
important as flexibility in

892
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,920
the application of combat
power on the battlefield.

893
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,860
Isn't it cool to come up with
principles and then just say, yeah,

894
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:20,820
you got to apply. I'm like, as needed.
It's interesting. There's a, there's a,

895
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:26,100
there's a, it shows how much you
have to think as a leader. Yeah.

896
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,200
You have to look at things all the time
and sometimes your principals getting

897
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,043
ready to back off though.

898
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:34,350
And that's Kinda what we
did in the dichotomy of
leadership because can you make

899
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:38,910
things too simple? Yes. You can cover
and move the number one principle.

900
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,390
Can you cover and move too much?
Yes. You can prioritize. Next. Cute.

901
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:45,210
Can you prioritize and execute too much?
Yes you can. What does that look like?

902
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:50,190
It looks like target fixation. What is,
what does cover move too much look like?

903
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,990
It looks like you're stepping
on the toes of other elements.

904
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:59,190
What is too simple? Look like? You
haven't covered all the contingencies.

905
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,620
What is too much decentralized
command look like?

906
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:06,720
It looks like your people don't even
know where you're supposed to be going

907
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:10,080
because you've haven't made it clear.
You've let them go too far

908
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,641
back to the book.

909
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:20,641
No commander can rigidly
follow the examples provided
by doctrinal resources but

910
00:55:21,281 --> 00:55:24,520
must modify them according to his mission,

911
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:28,330
the situation and the terrain
over which he is fighting.

912
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,310
So there you go.

913
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:36,550
Now what was interesting is I
found this in an air force manual.

914
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:40,010
So that's, that's what I covered
from that Fmfm six tech for,

915
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:45,011
which is just really good broad
principles of combat principles of war.

916
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,761
Now it was interesting,

917
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,340
I was looking at an air force to
kind of get their perspective,

918
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,620
similar perspective,
not as detailed,

919
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,150
but one thing that they did that was
interesting was they put the other

920
00:55:56,151 --> 00:56:01,151
countries principles of war and
compare them to our principles of war.

921
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,700
And a lot of them are very,
very close.

922
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,570
But one of them that stood out
was the former Soviet Union. And,

923
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:14,810
and this is where we get into,
you know,

924
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,170
I was talking specifically
about the USSR back in the day,

925
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:20,450
back in the eighties
back in the 70s you know,

926
00:56:20,451 --> 00:56:22,430
this is the other superpower in the world.

927
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:28,510
And they have some interesting theories.

928
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:32,950
And, and again, there's a little chart
that I found it kind of laid out,

929
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:36,550
you know.
So in America we have objective

930
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,850
in Great Britain and Australia, they
say selection, maintenance of aim,

931
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,640
right?
So understand what your aim is.

932
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,110
We have on offense offensive
in Great Britain, Australia,

933
00:56:50,111 --> 00:56:51,730
they have offensive action.

934
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:58,100
We have mass meaning we're going
to use our concentration of force.

935
00:56:58,101 --> 00:57:00,740
What does Great Britain and Australia
call it? Concentration of force.

936
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:05,390
We both have economy of force. We call
it maneuver. They call it flexibility.

937
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,760
We call it unity of command. They call
it cooperation, which is interesting.

938
00:57:10,761 --> 00:57:13,160
Cooperation is very similar
to cover and move. Yeah.

939
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,900
We both have security. We both
have surprise. We have simplicity.

940
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,220
They don't have simplicity,

941
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:22,040
but they have another one called
the maintenance of morale,

942
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:26,240
which is an interesting,
important thing that maybe we left out.

943
00:57:26,241 --> 00:57:28,880
Why do we leave that out?
It's an important one.

944
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:33,950
France,
they have three concentration of effort.

945
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,760
That's the same as mass surprise. That's
another one and then their last one,

946
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:42,830
liberty of action, which is interesting.
That's decentralized command, right? Hey,

947
00:57:42,831 --> 00:57:45,770
you've got to go out and make
things happen. Yeah. China,

948
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:48,890
they have some similar ones.
Objective,

949
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,230
they call it selection and
maintenance of the offense.

950
00:57:51,231 --> 00:57:53,360
They call it offensive action mass.

951
00:57:53,361 --> 00:57:56,390
They call a concentration
of force maneuver.

952
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:59,210
This is an interesting one.
Maneuver.

953
00:57:59,211 --> 00:58:03,600
They call it initiative and flexibility.
Again,

954
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,890
a little bit of decentralized command
sprinkled on that unity of command.

955
00:58:07,891 --> 00:58:10,500
They have coordination,
they have security,

956
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:14,610
they have surprise and their
last one is morale, mobility,

957
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:18,390
political mobilization
and freedom of action.

958
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,160
Interesting dynamic from
China and then they,

959
00:58:26,281 --> 00:58:27,900
they listed out the Soviet,

960
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:32,280
the former Soviet once because this
is one of the largest armies that ever

961
00:58:32,281 --> 00:58:35,670
existed. This former Soviet Armand
Army. And as I was reading that little,

962
00:58:35,671 --> 00:58:36,120
this little,

963
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:40,920
this little chart about what the Soviets
had masking and correlation of forces

964
00:58:40,921 --> 00:58:45,100
economy and sufficiency of force
initiative, Surprise Mobility Temple.

965
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,830
I was, I was going to, there's,

966
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:51,831
I remembered reading an old assessment
of the Soviet style of warfare broken the

967
00:58:53,291 --> 00:58:58,291
dude and I remembered it
had some interesting takes
and I was able to find this

968
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,220
field manual from the 80s I
want to say again, this is,

969
00:59:02,221 --> 00:59:05,520
these are like from the same time period
as the FM that I just read from the

970
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,550
Marine Corps, the FM, there's updated
ones which we can cover as well.

971
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:11,070
But these are the old school ones.
And again,

972
00:59:11,071 --> 00:59:16,071
it's in the 80s I mean you wouldn't assess
the Soviet Union the same now as you

973
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:20,010
would then. So this, we had a manual,

974
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:25,100
America had a manual FM 102 tack one the
Soviet Army and I thought it was kind

975
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:31,790
of worth reviewing some of what,

976
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:35,780
what they talk about principles
of war because again,

977
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:40,781
this was like one of the largest
standing standing armies in history.

978
00:59:41,271 --> 00:59:43,100
It was our major foe.

979
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:46,820
It was well experienced from World War II.

980
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,850
So figure with all that,
you know,

981
00:59:49,851 --> 00:59:54,650
we probably could learn something
from them. So here we go.

982
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,270
Getting into the Soviet Army a little bit
and some of their principles, how they,

983
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:00,920
how they rolled

984
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,150
the introduces it by saying
the Soviet ground forces.

985
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:09,410
This field male describes the operations
and tactics of Soviet general purpose

986
01:00:09,411 --> 01:00:10,280
ground forces.

987
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,270
The content is based on information in
Soviet writings and other open source

988
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:15,050
literature.

989
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:19,550
Most available information is focused
on potential battle in central Europe.

990
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,700
This is when this was the reality.
Folks, this is in the 80s.

991
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:30,040
The Soviets believe that any future war
could involve the use of nuclear weapons

992
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,000
and that the initial stage of the
war will be decisive. This is crazy.

993
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,340
Tactical nuclear,
tactical,

994
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,400
nuclear weapons have been assigned
at all levels from division up.

995
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:47,150
That's crazy. Wait, so what does
that mean? Everybody has new,

996
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,740
well, at the division level, so yes,

997
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,380
a lot of people have, a lot
of people have nukes. Uh,

998
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:02,120
the Soviets have the largest and most
effective array of chemical weapons and

999
01:01:02,121 --> 01:01:03,230
equipment in the world.

1000
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,390
They are capable of employing chemical
agents from battalion level upward.

1001
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,460
That's crazy.

1002
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:16,150
So a battalion is like the lowest
fighting unit that we have.

1003
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:20,570
It's, it's, it's, I don't know, 500,

1004
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:25,300
600 maybe 700 guys generally.
And imagine 700 guys with a,

1005
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,450
with an o five. This is a probably a
35, 40 year old guy in charge of it.

1006
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,430
They got chemical weapons
on the battlefield ready
to employ. And by the way,

1007
01:01:34,431 --> 01:01:37,430
two levels above them. At the division
level. That's what we're talking about.

1008
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,020
Nuclear Weapons.

1009
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:46,250
Not exactly what I love.
Okay. The Soviet front,

1010
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:47,780
I had to put this in here.

1011
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:52,460
The font is the largest
field formation in wartime.

1012
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:56,600
It is an operational administrative unit
and its size and composition can vary

1013
01:01:56,601 --> 01:02:00,200
widely depending on the
mission and situation.

1014
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:05,720
Roughly equivalent to a US
or NATO army group of front.

1015
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:10,550
It could be composed of three to
five armies with organic artillery,

1016
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:15,170
missile layer defense engineer. The
reason I found that funny little layer,

1017
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,870
there's,
I often refer to Ashkelon front

1018
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,780
simply as the front,

1019
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,260
but what what is also interesting,

1020
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:29,040
I looked up front to see if
that was a commonly used,

1021
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,220
if to see if that definition and it did.

1022
01:02:32,221 --> 01:02:36,840
They didn't have it listed. They didn't
have a, this is a, this is a group,

1023
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,270
an army group. They didn't list it
that way. So That's interesting.

1024
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:42,840
Learn something new. All right. Um,

1025
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:48,800
at this time they're saying that the
Soviet ground forces were like 1.8 to 2

1026
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:54,020
million people and 191 maneuver divisions.

1027
01:02:54,021 --> 01:02:55,320
So to answer your question,

1028
01:02:55,650 --> 01:03:00,650
191 divisions and each one
of those hundred and 91
divisions had tactical nukes.

1029
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:07,710
Get some
man,

1030
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:13,020
and now we get into, so just that just
kind of lays out how this came together.

1031
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,123
Okay.

1032
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:19,160
The Soviet concept of war to the Soviet's
war is a manifestation of the class

1033
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,504
struggle.

1034
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:27,220
It is an expression of the
conflict between progressive
forces of socialism and

1035
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,900
the reactionary forces of
imperialistic capitalism,

1036
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:34,110
which they feel will ultimately raise B,

1037
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:38,460
which w which they feel will be
ultimately resolved in favor of socialism.

1038
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:43,710
The Soviet concept of war represents,
represents a continuation of politics.

1039
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:46,870
Same thing that we have. We, you
know, we think of war is when,

1040
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:50,880
when politics don't work, that's
when war happens, unfortunately.

1041
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:54,210
But yeah,

1042
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:59,250
reactionary forces of imperialistic
capitalists. You know what that is?

1043
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:04,260
That's America boy.
Uh,

1044
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:08,190
that's how the, that's how
parts of the world view America.

1045
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:13,860
All right. The Soviet military
doctrine is officially accepted.

1046
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,870
The Soviet military doctrine is the
officially accepted set of concepts that

1047
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:23,280
delineate the ways and means to achieve
military objectives in the interest of

1048
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:24,114
politics.

1049
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:29,010
The formulation of Soviet
military doctrine is a
continuous evolutionary process

1050
01:04:29,011 --> 01:04:33,480
based on number one communist ideology.
Number two,

1051
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,730
Soviet foreign policy.
Number three,

1052
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:38,640
economic and military strength
of adversaries. Number four,

1053
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,260
Soviet resources in geography.
Number five, history. Number six,

1054
01:04:43,261 --> 01:04:44,400
science and technology.

1055
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:49,550
Soviet military doctrine is based on an
elaborate integrated system of thought

1056
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,710
and then it breaks it
down a little bit more.

1057
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:56,400
And I kind of had to build that in there
cause it talks about military doctrine

1058
01:04:56,401 --> 01:05:00,600
and then it talks about military
science is the study and analysis of the

1059
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:05,601
diverse psychological and material
phenomena relevant to armed combat for

1060
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:08,910
developing practical recommendations
for the achievement of victory in war.

1061
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,260
Pretty straight forward.

1062
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,220
But the reason I had to say or talk about
military sciences because I wanted to

1063
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:15,150
get to this point,

1064
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:18,370
which is military art and a lot of times
we don't think of the Soviets. Right?

1065
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:21,970
What do you think of the Soviets? What do
you think of? I, I know what you think.

1066
01:05:21,971 --> 01:05:23,770
What do you think of when you
think of the Soviets? Come on.

1067
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:28,330
When you think of the Ussr,
what do you think of? You're
going to let me down, Bro.

1068
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:31,660
What? What do you think of when you
think of like the, the Russians,

1069
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:36,280
what do you think of these? They're
strong wrestlers. Okay. As a whole.

1070
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,750
When you think of the Russians,
what do you think of,

1071
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:41,350
if you had to characterize the
Russians in one individual,

1072
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:44,560
who would you think of? Stalin? Ah, close.

1073
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,680
I thought you were going to say
Drago. Okay. Ivan [inaudible].

1074
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,740
Ivan Drago the machine, right? Sure. This
is what this is. That's what I think of.

1075
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:56,650
You know, I think of that. That's what the
Soviet Union is. It's like the, you know,

1076
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:01,620
no emotions, no religion.
It's just raw machine.

1077
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:05,060
Cold. Right? Actually
fairly accurate. Yeah,

1078
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:06,970
but they go here.

1079
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:11,971
Military art is the most important and
primary field within military science and

1080
01:06:12,791 --> 01:06:14,470
is the basis for strategy,

1081
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:18,450
operational art and tactics is the
theory and practice of conducting armed

1082
01:06:18,451 --> 01:06:20,850
conflict.
So they put this high hide.

1083
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,140
Yeah.

1084
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,910
Respect to the art. Art.
Probably interesting.

1085
01:06:27,911 --> 01:06:30,280
Possibly higher than we do.

1086
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,710
Maybe you know it is possible.
All right, so now we get into it.

1087
01:06:35,890 --> 01:06:39,820
And
principles of military art.

1088
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,230
Soviet military theorists consider
the following points to be the general

1089
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:46,620
principles of military art.
So that's what,

1090
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:50,320
that's where I'm going with all this
guys to get their principles. Gotcha.

1091
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:56,830
They do not represent any
special revelation of truth
or radical departure from

1092
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:59,140
traditional male military thought.
However,

1093
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:01,570
by their emphasis on
these particular points,

1094
01:07:01,571 --> 01:07:03,820
Soviet military leaders
reveal their character,

1095
01:07:03,821 --> 01:07:07,900
the character of their military thinking
and predict the basic characteristics

1096
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:12,580
of future Soviet military operations.
According to the Soviets,

1097
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,680
they're armed forces must,

1098
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:17,410
and here's the list before we
prepared to accomplish the mission,

1099
01:07:17,411 --> 01:07:21,550
regardless of conditions under which
war begins or must be conducted.

1100
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,190
Yeah,

1101
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:27,030
next, achieve surprise whenever
possible. It sounds familiar.

1102
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:30,140
Military operations must be
characterized by decisive descent,

1103
01:07:30,141 --> 01:07:34,230
aggressiveness forces must strive
continuously to seize and to hold the

1104
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:37,290
initiative. That's good information. Next,

1105
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:41,790
make full use of all available military
assets and capabilities to achieve

1106
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:46,380
victory. Next, ensure that
major formations and units,

1107
01:07:46,381 --> 01:07:47,790
all of all services,

1108
01:07:47,791 --> 01:07:52,791
branches and arms effect through
thorough and continuous coordination.

1109
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:54,240
Got To work together. Cover, move,

1110
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,060
select the principal enemy objective
to be seized and the best routes for

1111
01:08:00,061 --> 01:08:00,894
attacking it.

1112
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:05,790
Make a decisive concentration of combat
power at the correct time, right?

1113
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:10,890
Same thing. Next, maintain continuous
and reliable command and control.

1114
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,023
Interesting.

1115
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:16,100
The reason that's interesting is that's
like a little bit leaning towards

1116
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:19,940
centralized control, right? Centralized
Command as opposed to less committed,

1117
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,020
but they're going to reverse
that later. Next, be determined,

1118
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,450
decisive in achieving the
assigned mission. Next,

1119
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:30,620
maintained complete security of combat
operations. Security, right? Same thing.

1120
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:31,820
Next,

1121
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:36,530
reconstitute reserves and restore combat
effectiveness as quickly as possible.

1122
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:41,330
Makes Sense. Next. Well
now it continues on.

1123
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:46,250
These are general principles that apply
to all three levels of military art,

1124
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:47,480
strategy,
operations,

1125
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:52,310
and tactics at each of these levels that
are more specific detailed principles.

1126
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:54,680
Soviet military fought,

1127
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:00,040
subscribes to certain laws of war at
the strategic level and principals of

1128
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:05,270
operational art and tactics which
apply to the actual conduct of combat.

1129
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,580
So here are the laws of war

1130
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:11,450
first law,

1131
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:15,770
the course and outcome of war waged with
unlimited to employment of all means of

1132
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:19,640
conflict depends primarily on the
correlation of available strictly military

1133
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:22,820
combatants at the beginning of the war.
Second law,

1134
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:25,910
the course and outcome of
the war depending on the
correlation of the military

1135
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,340
potentials of the combatants.
Third Law,

1136
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:32,600
the course and outcome of war depend
on its political content. Fourth, law,

1137
01:09:32,690 --> 01:09:36,320
the course and outcome of war
depend on the correlation of moral,

1138
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,010
political and psychological capabilities
of the peoples and the armies of the

1139
01:09:40,011 --> 01:09:43,460
combatants.
Now,

1140
01:09:43,461 --> 01:09:47,060
I didn't break those down because they
actually do it for you in the manual.

1141
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:52,130
Here's what in simpler terms,
what these things mean. First law,

1142
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:56,240
be prepared,
prepare in peacetime for the next war.

1143
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,200
Forces in being are the decisive factors.

1144
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:05,120
The side with the most and best troops
and equipment at the start of the war

1145
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,520
will win the war.
That makes sense.

1146
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:11,270
Barring any major strategic blunders,
second law,

1147
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:17,410
the side which can best sustain a
protracted war will win the war.

1148
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,630
Makes Sense.
Third Law,

1149
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:23,840
the higher the political stakes of a war,

1150
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,200
the longer and more violent it will be.

1151
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,670
That's a good one.
That's a good one.

1152
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:37,260
And you got to think about that one.
From a leadership perspective,

1153
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:41,760
when you start getting involved
in things that have higher stakes,

1154
01:10:41,761 --> 01:10:44,010
this is when people start
stabbing each other in the back.

1155
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:47,730
So people get ruthless.
So when there's more at stake,

1156
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,500
there's going to be more violence,

1157
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:51,530
Huh?
Yeah.

1158
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:57,190
We don't recognize that sometimes,
hey, this guy's always been cool to me,

1159
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,310
but all of a sudden the stakes go up.
All of a sudden we're getting stabbed

1160
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:04,930
toward the dirts coming out.
Right. The claws come out.

1161
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,450
It's always interesting. You get to
see people's real true colors, right.

1162
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:15,240
When things are at stake, when more at
stake, people's true colors come out,

1163
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:16,980
the violence occurs.

1164
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:20,050
Yeah. Yeah. Can I like when the, you know,

1165
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,850
the detective shows up at your door,
hey, let got some questions for you.

1166
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,180
Ah, I don't have time. Whatever.
All, we could do it here,

1167
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:32,680
or we could go back to the station.
All right. All right. You know?

1168
01:11:32,681 --> 01:11:35,170
Then they start revealing little
bit more. Then they're like, hey,

1169
01:11:35,350 --> 01:11:37,900
they don't want to cooperate that much.
They say this thing. They say, yeah,

1170
01:11:37,901 --> 01:11:41,170
I was there, but I don't remember all
this stuff. And they said, well, hey,

1171
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,710
if you don't tell us the truth, you
could be going to jail. All your freedom.

1172
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:48,250
Now the stakes go up off. They start
talking more. See what I'm saying?

1173
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,720
Then they say, hey, your friend,
was he involved in what I'm saying?

1174
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,540
And you're like, oh no, no, no,
you're right. Hey, if you're lying,

1175
01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:00,070
not only do you go to jail, then you know,
and they raise the stakes a little bit.

1176
01:12:00,071 --> 01:12:01,090
Odd.
They ran on their friends.

1177
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:05,760
No mm clinic where the stakes go up. Go
Up. Yeah, man, the violence increases.

1178
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,990
Next fourth law war aims must be seen as
just modern war cannot be waged without

1179
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:20,160
public support. Very important.
Yeah, very important.

1180
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:24,780
So Viet Planning and preparation for war
reflected dominant feeling that war is

1181
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:25,614
inevitable.

1182
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,550
This is not to say that
the USSR wants war,

1183
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,850
but that is preparing for it continuously.

1184
01:12:36,290 --> 01:12:40,190
The Soviet state is autocratic,
militarized, and centralized.

1185
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:45,050
It's political and economic systems
give priority to military requirements.

1186
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:50,060
The state allocates resources and
directs production for preparation and

1187
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:51,650
maintenance of a war footing.

1188
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:58,210
The Soviet Union is prepared to exert
itself at great expense to achieve its

1189
01:12:58,731 --> 01:13:03,560
goal.
It is a nation which through civil war,

1190
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:10,070
collectivization attendant famine and
purges inflicted more than 20 million

1191
01:13:12,001 --> 01:13:16,650
deaths on its own citizens
from the Russian revolution
to the start of World War

1192
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,483
II.

1193
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:22,430
It is a nation that endured the loss of
20 million people during World War II.

1194
01:13:22,730 --> 01:13:25,940
It's tolerance for sacrifice is high.

1195
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:30,770
Yeah.
That's a little something to think about.

1196
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:36,220
Now what's interesting is
what's stronger that or the core

1197
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:46,440
desire and mandate for
freedom that we have here,

1198
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:51,370
and actually I can answer that question
because history has answered that

1199
01:13:51,371 --> 01:13:53,950
question.
Freedom will win.

1200
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,383
Yeah.

1201
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:57,563
Next,

1202
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,160
as the laws of war dominate
strategic planning for war,

1203
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:06,960
so do principals of operational art and
tactics govern the conduct of warfare

1204
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:08,820
within a given theater of operations.

1205
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,090
The popular Western version of these
Soviet and tactical principles is very

1206
01:14:13,091 --> 01:14:17,560
brief. Objective offense,
surprise, maneuver, and mass.

1207
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:23,070
This list is not fairly characterize the
basis on which Soviet military leaders

1208
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:25,870
plan and conduct operations and tactics.

1209
01:14:26,260 --> 01:14:30,310
Just as they add new equipment to
their forces without abandoning older

1210
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:31,144
equipment.

1211
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:35,800
The Soviets have modernized operational
and tactical principles without fully

1212
01:14:35,801 --> 01:14:38,110
abandoned,
abandoning their earlier ones.

1213
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:42,640
A good place to begin is with
those classical principles
that were taught by the

1214
01:14:42,641 --> 01:14:44,290
czarist at general staff.

1215
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:48,250
So these are the classic
Russian military principles.

1216
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,850
Here they go.
First,

1217
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,120
extreme exertion of force at
the very beginning of the war.

1218
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:56,450
Okay,

1219
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,140
next simultaneity of actions.

1220
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:05,960
Next economy of forces. Next
concentration. Next chief objective,

1221
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:10,310
the enemy's army. Next
surprise. Next unity of action.

1222
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:13,220
Preparation,
energetic pursuit,

1223
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:18,400
security initiative and dominance over
the enemy's will strength where the enemy

1224
01:15:20,061 --> 01:15:22,100
is weak and that's the list.

1225
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:25,550
That's the old classic list and
it breaks it down a little bit.

1226
01:15:25,551 --> 01:15:27,770
The most significant
points of this list are

1227
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,240
okay.

1228
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:29,930
First,

1229
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:34,430
he who gets to the initial
battle with the most wins.

1230
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:38,090
That's sun sued.
By the way,

1231
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:43,070
the enemy must be confronted with
more than one situation to deal with.

1232
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:47,360
Oh, that's, that's how I got
are locked all those years ago.

1233
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:50,000
I was dealing with that choke
and there came me arm lock.

1234
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:54,590
Next one should not be diverted
by geographical objectives,

1235
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,910
but should concentrate on the destruction
of the enemies. Military forces.

1236
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,890
Next,
detailed,

1237
01:16:00,891 --> 01:16:05,891
exacting preparation must precede and
attack design actions to preempt your

1238
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:11,330
opponent and keep him reacting
to situations that you control.

1239
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:17,000
Concentrate on the enemy's weak
points rather than his strengths.

1240
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:20,090
Contemporary military,

1241
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:25,360
contemporary Soviet military theory just
hold that nuclear weapon tree and other

1242
01:16:25,671 --> 01:16:29,600
means of modern warfare have
modified these basic principles.

1243
01:16:29,690 --> 01:16:34,690
By the early 1970s the
following principles dominated
Soviet operational art and

1244
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:35,684
tactics.

1245
01:16:37,630 --> 01:16:40,450
So they literally made these
adjustments for nuclear war

1246
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:46,330
first mobility and high rates
of combat operations. Next,

1247
01:16:46,331 --> 01:16:49,990
concentration of main efforts and the
creation of superiority and forces and

1248
01:16:49,991 --> 01:16:53,530
means over the enemy at decisive
place and at the decisive time.

1249
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:58,360
Next surprise and security. Next
combat activeness. That's a good one.

1250
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:00,730
Combat activeness.
Next,

1251
01:17:00,731 --> 01:17:03,970
preservation of the combat
effectiveness of friendly forces.

1252
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:09,150
Next conformity to the conformity
of the goal to the actual situation.

1253
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,600
That's a good one.

1254
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:16,400
Conformity of the goal
to the actual situation.

1255
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:21,050
Know what that means is your goal can
change and it can change based on the

1256
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:25,880
situation you're in. Yeah,
that is important. And the
last one is coordination,

1257
01:17:25,881 --> 01:17:28,760
which is basically covered move.

1258
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:34,570
Now it goes on a melding of contemporary
writings and those of the recent pass

1259
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:40,241
plus an influence of significant classical
Russian principles results in the

1260
01:17:40,251 --> 01:17:45,170
following specific Soviet principals
of operational art and tactics.

1261
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:46,730
And we'd go into a long list.

1262
01:17:49,900 --> 01:17:54,820
The offensive is the basic form of combat
action only by a resolute on offense

1263
01:17:54,821 --> 01:17:59,800
conducted at a high tempo and to great
depth is total destruction of the enemy

1264
01:17:59,801 --> 01:18:04,150
achieved. So we need to go
hard. We need to go fast.

1265
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:08,350
Next combat maneuver units must be
mobile and capable of rapid movement.

1266
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,090
Next fire support,

1267
01:18:10,091 --> 01:18:14,800
command and control and logistics
must be as mobile as maneuver units.

1268
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:15,940
That makes sense.

1269
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:21,070
Conduct or conduct thorough
and continuous reconnaissance.

1270
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,880
Find the enemy's weak points.
Yes.

1271
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:26,640
Okay.

1272
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:31,200
Perform a thorough estimate of the
situation and make timely analytical

1273
01:18:31,201 --> 01:18:33,840
decisions.
Be Realistic.

1274
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,990
Consider the mission enemy,
your own combat power, terrain,

1275
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:43,400
weather and light conditions and time.
So yeah,

1276
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:45,470
you got to look at this situation.
You've got to look at it.

1277
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:50,180
Best thing about that and you don't
hear this very often. Be Realistic.

1278
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:55,220
How good advices that it's damn
good advice. Yeah, be realistic.

1279
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,340
You don't hear that often enough.

1280
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:03,740
Next plan and prepare
extensively and in detail.

1281
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,610
That's a good idea. As we know though,
you can go to the extreme with that.

1282
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:08,570
You can overdo it.

1283
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:13,460
The planning and conduct of an operation
must involve the full coordination and

1284
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:17,120
cooperation of all commanders involved.
That's important.

1285
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:20,910
If you're coming up with an operation,

1286
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,790
you got to involve the commanders that
people that are going to be in the

1287
01:19:23,791 --> 01:19:24,624
operation with you.

1288
01:19:24,690 --> 01:19:26,910
You can't just send them an email
of how you want it to go down.

1289
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,170
That's not going to work.

1290
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:34,950
There must be unity of command,
a signal commander for every operation.

1291
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:36,990
Boom.
We already talked about that.

1292
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,490
Fully orchestrate all of the all
available combat means in coordinated,

1293
01:19:41,491 --> 01:19:44,970
cooperative, combined
arms effort. Makes Sense.

1294
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,100
Next to deceive the enemy.

1295
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:53,120
Attack from an unexpected direction
at an unexpected time. Check.

1296
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,920
Use terrain and weather to your advantage.

1297
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:58,580
Check strike early with great force check.

1298
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:00,700
Okay.

1299
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:03,940
Constantly strive to preempt
and dominate the enemy. Again,

1300
01:20:03,941 --> 01:20:04,930
I was thinking when I hear that,

1301
01:20:04,931 --> 01:20:07,560
I always think of Jujitsu when someone's
getting the upper hand on you and you

1302
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,960
can't dig your way out of it,

1303
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:16,290
attack the enemy violently and
simultaneously throughout his depth.

1304
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:21,180
Carry the battle to the enemy rear with
swift penetrations by maneuver units,

1305
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,700
fire aviation,
airborne and Hella born assaults.

1306
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:29,190
And by unconventional warfare
means be bold and decisive,

1307
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:31,290
seize and hold the initiative.

1308
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:36,060
Isn't it amazing that just
being aggressive goes so far?

1309
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,730
If you are just get the upper hand.

1310
01:20:38,850 --> 01:20:43,380
I mean if you get the upper hand you just
have it and you just need to maintain

1311
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,260
it.
How do you maintain it?

1312
01:20:44,261 --> 01:20:48,420
It's by be continuing to be aggressive
and not sitting back on your haunches

1313
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,800
when you got the upper hand. I do
that and you just do some time. What?

1314
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:55,710
Sit back on your haunches or yeah,
get a little bit of a advantage.

1315
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:59,400
Relax too much. Let
let a little, you know,

1316
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:03,300
let a little time give that person to,
you know when you see it as an MMA,

1317
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:08,460
when somebody gets dazed, right.
And the person lets them recover,

1318
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:11,220
takes him a minute,
takes them a minute and 30 seconds.

1319
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:15,270
They don't get on that
person. Yeah. Got To do that.

1320
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:21,230
Prosecute and operation relentlessly
without pause under all conditions of

1321
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:26,160
visibility or NBC contamination.
That's nuclear,

1322
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:30,360
biological and chemical contamination.
Doesn't matter. Keep going.

1323
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:35,880
The Russians,
this is good.

1324
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:40,290
Keep the enemy under constant
pressure and off balance.

1325
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,820
Do not allow them to react effectively.
Obviously Jujitsu,

1326
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:50,450
fully exploit the effects of nuclear or
chemical strikes with deep attacks by

1327
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:56,760
all available forces.
I wonder what these guys were thinking.

1328
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,840
They're thinking about how they're going
to follow up the nuclear assault bro.

1329
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:13,190
Whenever possible achieve
mass by concentrated mask
nuclear or non-nuclear fires

1330
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:17,250
rather than by massing maneuver forces.

1331
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,160
What that is actually saying is
instead of using your troops,

1332
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,590
use nukes instead to get the upper hand.

1333
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:32,280
Good Lord man,
how did he get to this?

1334
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:37,200
I mean we, we can look back
on it now. I hope. I mean,

1335
01:22:37,201 --> 01:22:41,040
cause there's obviously new
cars everywhere still, but man,

1336
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:44,790
I hope people aren't sitting around
plotting right now coming up with the

1337
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:49,680
tactics. I mean obviously we have to. You
have to, you have to game it out. Yeah,

1338
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,850
it makes sense.
But man,

1339
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:55,370
I hope we got some other avenues of
approach before jumping into the wall.

1340
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,980
New quantia's
next.

1341
01:22:58,981 --> 01:23:01,620
If maneuver forces must be mass,
do so rapidly,

1342
01:23:01,621 --> 01:23:04,440
disperse them as soon as possible
after the task has been achieved.

1343
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:06,310
Maneuver first with firepower.

1344
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:11,260
Firepower is maneuver and move gets
some maneuver forces should attack the

1345
01:23:11,261 --> 01:23:14,230
weakest points in the enemy
defenses. Yes. Sun Tzu. Thank you.

1346
01:23:14,231 --> 01:23:16,810
We agree if necessary,

1347
01:23:16,811 --> 01:23:21,520
create weak points are holes with
nuclear or non nuclear fires.

1348
01:23:22,510 --> 01:23:26,860
Bypass enemy's strong points of strike
and is, yeah. Hey, you know what?

1349
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:30,010
We were going to create a wake
weak point with nukes. Get some,

1350
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,270
it's funny to hear that.
How like nukes is just sort of one of the,

1351
01:23:34,271 --> 01:23:36,580
I'm just throwing it out there,
just throwing it out there.

1352
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:39,400
We're not talking like, hey, is
anyone going, hey by the way,

1353
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:44,350
that's the end of the world. Hey,
hey kernel. Hey Kernel I got,

1354
01:23:44,440 --> 01:23:47,530
I just want to bring something up. You
realize that we all die when this happens,

1355
01:23:47,531 --> 01:23:51,820
right? Like this isn't, this isn't like
a good plan. You're planning socks. Yeah.

1356
01:23:51,821 --> 01:23:53,740
Like hey we get it.
Hey there's a little,

1357
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:56,500
we had to create a weak point like right
over there. Hey we should send like,

1358
01:23:56,950 --> 01:24:00,670
like you know like maybe
12 guys or something maybe
over it or we could just use

1359
01:24:00,671 --> 01:24:05,530
this new cause it's here or maybe I'm
going to send this document to a Jordan

1360
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:06,400
Peterson cause cause you know,

1361
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:10,600
you know how we use all paranoid about
new nuclear war when he was in college

1362
01:24:10,601 --> 01:24:13,170
and that's kind of what sent him down
this path of how could we get to this

1363
01:24:13,171 --> 01:24:17,970
situation
is going to really disturbing.

1364
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:22,650
It's like hey boss, look, check this
out. When you guys were playing. Yes.

1365
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:26,530
How we're going to create a little
weakness where the nucleus Newcomb man,

1366
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,940
scary.
It's very scary.

1367
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,170
Avoid frontal attacks wherever possible.

1368
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:38,530
Strike the enemy in the flanks of the
rear. Obviously we're all about flanking.

1369
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:42,200
Maintain security rule and flanks.
Maintain sufficient follow on,

1370
01:24:42,201 --> 01:24:44,920
forced to assure achievement of
the mission and to end to deal with

1371
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:49,150
contingencies,
maintain a uninterrupted combat support,

1372
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:53,020
maintain effective continuous command
and control and communications.

1373
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:56,260
That's getting a little bit,
you know, that's important,

1374
01:24:56,470 --> 01:25:00,070
but sometimes I think that they were very
centralized and you can see that from

1375
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:02,680
when they fought in Afghanistan that
they definitely had some centralized

1376
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:05,950
command going on and the
units that perform well with
a few that would have the

1377
01:25:05,951 --> 01:25:06,880
most decentralized,

1378
01:25:06,881 --> 01:25:11,200
which was generally their special
operations units maintain redundant

1379
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:12,850
communications at higher levels,

1380
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:17,320
rely rely on audio and visual signals
and well-rehearsed battle drills at lower

1381
01:25:17,321 --> 01:25:17,680
levels.

1382
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:21,670
Staffs at every level must have equipment
and skills necessary to collect and

1383
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:24,880
analyze information quickly employ radio,

1384
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:28,180
electronic combat to deprive the enemy
of effective command and control of his

1385
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:29,050
combat forces.

1386
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:34,030
That means they're going to use
jammers and whatnot at here.

1387
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:35,200
Now this is where it's interesting,

1388
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,240
so as much as I talk
about centralized command,

1389
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:41,200
adhered to the spirit and letter
of a plan, if the plan fails,

1390
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:45,370
use initiative to accomplish the mission
check, that's decentralized command.

1391
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:49,090
You can only do that if you actually
know what the mission is. Next,

1392
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:53,680
to be prepared to react effectively to
a rapidly changing battlefield. Check,

1393
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:57,130
develop procedures to deal with
numerous contingencies, check,

1394
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,960
think quickly and be decisive and
resourceful in accomplishing the mission.

1395
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:03,793
Check,

1396
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:09,140
conserve fighting strength through the
use of combat vehicles with collective

1397
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,060
NBC protection. Again, that's nuclear,
biological and chemical protection.

1398
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:18,290
Disbursable forces minimum combat
power necessary to accomplish the task.

1399
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,280
The use of captured the enemy
equipment and effective logistics

1400
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,120
and then that's the end of the list.
Obviously it's a pretty broad list,

1401
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,210
but very interesting.
You can see the parallels.

1402
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:35,350
You can see how the same themes come up
over and over again and it says this,

1403
01:26:35,351 --> 01:26:40,090
these principles are idealistic. They
are what the Soviets strive to achieve.

1404
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,070
They show what the
Soviets would like to do,

1405
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:45,490
but not in all cases what they
may be capable of doing. However,

1406
01:26:45,491 --> 01:26:50,491
the principles serve as a basis from
which any examination of Soviet operations

1407
01:26:51,190 --> 01:26:53,890
and tactics must start

1408
01:26:57,030 --> 01:27:02,010
and it can't. It's just crazy to read
about this nuclear warfare implications.

1409
01:27:02,011 --> 01:27:06,330
The advent of nuclear weapons
caused Soviet planners to
go through a long period

1410
01:27:06,331 --> 01:27:11,100
of rethinking and revising their
combined arms doctrine. Modern,

1411
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,610
totally mechanized armed forces supported
and threatened by weapons that can

1412
01:27:14,611 --> 01:27:16,830
change the face of the battlefield
in a matter of minutes,

1413
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,690
gave a whole new meaning
to the high speed combined.

1414
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:23,710
Our operations in depth,
uh,

1415
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:27,570
when we talk about can die combined
operations are combined arms in,

1416
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:31,080
in the military. We talk about, you know,

1417
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,360
we're going to use mortars or
we're going to use artillery.

1418
01:27:33,361 --> 01:27:35,850
We're going to use your air
sport. Where do you use, you know,

1419
01:27:36,030 --> 01:27:40,260
heavy machine gun fire. We're going to
use all those together in coordination to,

1420
01:27:40,620 --> 01:27:45,620
to catch our enemy in the combined arms
dilemma where there's no way to get out

1421
01:27:46,351 --> 01:27:51,000
of it. It's like checkmate, right?
Yeah. I never ever thought about,

1422
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:54,860
hey, let's get him in the ultimate
checkmate over here on this one. Bring in,

1423
01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:59,580
bring in the tactical nukes again,
just just to point out that,

1424
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:00,643
okay,

1425
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:05,410
under nuclear threatened conditions,

1426
01:28:05,411 --> 01:28:08,680
the Soviet offensive concept
would have the following features,

1427
01:28:08,681 --> 01:28:12,580
avoid concentrating, forces, concentrate
fires, but not firing weapons.

1428
01:28:13,030 --> 01:28:16,330
Attack across broader
frontage is on multiple axis.

1429
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,570
Avoid enemy's strong points,
probe for enemy, weak points,

1430
01:28:19,571 --> 01:28:21,130
penetrate where possible,
commit,

1431
01:28:21,131 --> 01:28:24,760
follow on forces when and where
they can best contribute to success,

1432
01:28:24,761 --> 01:28:29,761
drive rapidly and deeply into the enemy
rear to destroy nuclear weapons and

1433
01:28:30,851 --> 01:28:31,870
enemy forces.

1434
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:37,013
Okay,

1435
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:41,270
and just to wrap this up because
I thought this was an interesting,

1436
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,280
we're not covered a bunch of this book,

1437
01:28:43,281 --> 01:28:46,490
just like we barely covered any of the
marine corps rifle. Uh, manual. Yeah.

1438
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:49,450
Norms,

1439
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:54,310
initiative and flexibility as Soviet
military doctrine includes a system of

1440
01:28:54,311 --> 01:28:59,311
performance standards expressed
in numerical forms called norms.

1441
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:04,770
Norms defined the ideal performance in
a multitude of tasks and conditions.

1442
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:07,260
I've talked about task conditions
and standards on here before.

1443
01:29:08,850 --> 01:29:11,490
They are used to determine
such things as intervals.

1444
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:15,060
Rates of March frontage
is logistics requirements,

1445
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,370
fire support and training drills.

1446
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:22,020
Norms provide a mathematical
prescription for proper action.

1447
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,410
So this is where we get to,
you know,

1448
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:27,930
I started thinking of that
Soviet stereotypical like,
hey, we're just going to,

1449
01:29:27,931 --> 01:29:29,880
here's the numbers, plug them in
and that's what we're going to do.

1450
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:34,220
They are formulated by historical
analysis, training exercises,

1451
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:39,180
requirements and gaming
models based on norms.

1452
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:42,510
A given situation has
an approved response.

1453
01:29:43,050 --> 01:29:47,070
The correctness of commanders action or
his troops response is often measured by

1454
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:50,880
their adherence to the established
norms for that situation.

1455
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,770
The advantage of this system is that
it provides a high degree of combat

1456
01:29:55,771 --> 01:30:00,060
readiness, at least in the initial
stages, drills at the sub unit level,

1457
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:02,160
battalion or lower our well-rehearsed,

1458
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:06,150
the tactical level commander is aware in
advance of how well his troops can cope

1459
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:09,960
with time and space factors. The and so
there's, there's what's good about it.

1460
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:13,170
You have everything like laid out like
this is what we do in these situations.

1461
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,400
Back to the book of the
obvious disadvantage to
strict adherence to norms is

1462
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:21,600
less provision for the unexpected.

1463
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,340
If a situation arises for which there
was no established normative response,

1464
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,480
a lower level commander
might find themselves in
peril, which I totally agree.

1465
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:36,380
That's why I made the training super
hard and crazy for the guys that I put

1466
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:40,530
through training so that they were
ready for non normative situations.

1467
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:45,750
The topic of initiative receives much
attention and Soviet military writings.

1468
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:47,730
When a plan fails,

1469
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,330
commanders are strongly urge
to use initiative as a cure.

1470
01:30:51,331 --> 01:30:56,190
All the Soviet perception of initiative
involves finding a correct solution,

1471
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:59,100
following normative patterns.

1472
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:03,390
If the commander adheres to norms
and a successful he is praised.

1473
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,280
If he violates normative patterns
and fails, he's condemned.

1474
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,280
So what, what kind of a decentralized
command do you end up there?

1475
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:14,610
No one wants to take any risks.
Success, however, is most important.

1476
01:31:14,611 --> 01:31:18,930
If commander solves a problem by his own
devices, he is lauded. So that's cool.

1477
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:23,960
But if you're afraid that if you make a
call and it doesn't go right and you're

1478
01:31:24,511 --> 01:31:26,250
going to get in trouble for that,
you know what you're gonna do,

1479
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:29,490
you're not gonna make a call. And
that's what crushes your decentralized.

1480
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:31,940
Yeah.
Isn't that like a good

1481
01:31:33,710 --> 01:31:37,010
tactic or whatever for like kids were,
you know,

1482
01:31:37,011 --> 01:31:40,820
like if they make an honest mistake,
you don't just hammer him, you know,

1483
01:31:40,910 --> 01:31:44,510
you can correct them or
whatever. Um, otherwise, yeah,

1484
01:31:44,511 --> 01:31:47,810
they're not going to want to like venture
out and do things, you know? Yeah,

1485
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:48,680
totally.

1486
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:52,510
And, and this, yeah, you have to, you
have to allow your kids to make some say.

1487
01:31:52,750 --> 01:31:53,940
I I've been saying lately,

1488
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:57,840
you've got to allow your kids to brush
up against the guard rails of failure

1489
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:02,770
without smashing them. Yeah. The bumps
and bruises or when a good are what are,

1490
01:32:02,771 --> 01:32:06,490
what go is going to make
them formidable in life.

1491
01:32:06,690 --> 01:32:10,420
If they never got a bump or a bruise,
life's going to hit them hard.

1492
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:12,130
They won't be conditioned for it.

1493
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,960
And this thing wraps up just saying
these concepts are not descriptive of a

1494
01:32:16,961 --> 01:32:21,190
rigid or offensive doctrine,
but one that is both mobile and flexible.

1495
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,850
So there's a little something from the,

1496
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:29,410
from the Soviet army in, and obviously,
like I said, the principles of warfare,

1497
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:36,010
while they're nuanced and their
stated differently, they're the same.

1498
01:32:36,430 --> 01:32:39,490
I mean you see the same patterns over
and over again and they apply to war and

1499
01:32:39,491 --> 01:32:40,480
they apply to life.

1500
01:32:41,740 --> 01:32:44,860
And so I think it's important to see him
from different angles so that you can

1501
01:32:44,861 --> 01:32:48,280
understand them.
Because if you understand them broadly,

1502
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:51,280
well then you can see him in all things.

1503
01:32:52,240 --> 01:32:54,820
And if you see him in all things and you
can actually apply him in all things,

1504
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:57,490
which is important,
cause that's what's gonna make you better,

1505
01:32:57,491 --> 01:33:00,520
it's gonna make your Jujitsu better.
It's gonna make your business better,

1506
01:33:00,521 --> 01:33:03,040
it's gonna make your team better,
it's gonna make you a better leader,

1507
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:07,430
it's going to make you better and it's
going to make your life better. And he's,

1508
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,920
these principles have been
around for a long, long time.

1509
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:12,770
So that's the,

1510
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:14,540
okay,

1511
01:33:14,540 --> 01:33:19,010
that's the Soviet
maneuver warfare doctrine.

1512
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:21,230
And you know,

1513
01:33:21,230 --> 01:33:25,940
I also recently had to do
some maneuvering myself.

1514
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:29,630
Sure. A little bit of maneuvering
and I, I wanted to, uh,

1515
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:34,970
bring it up because it's an interesting
little bit of aggression. Yeah.

1516
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:36,500
A little bit of maneuver warfare.

1517
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:41,430
So I wrote another book and the book
is called Mikey and the dragons. Right.

1518
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:44,330
It's another kid's book.
It's for younger kids,

1519
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,420
maybe a tad younger than the warrior kid
crowd. Right. So we're talking like four,

1520
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:53,030
five, six, seven, eight
ish, something like that.

1521
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,003
However,

1522
01:33:55,850 --> 01:33:56,340
okay.

1523
01:33:56,340 --> 01:34:00,180
Like the warrior kid books,
there's lessons for everyone in there.

1524
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:05,910
Yes, there is. Yeah. And
so what's interesting, so I
wrote this book, I had to,

1525
01:34:05,911 --> 01:34:10,470
I had like a vision. Does that sound
too much? Oh yeah, when you say it,

1526
01:34:10,471 --> 01:34:15,180
but you know, I dig it. Okay.
I had the vision of this book,

1527
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:18,660
what the story was. Right. And I
wrote it. I wrote the first half,

1528
01:34:19,290 --> 01:34:21,840
the original idea just like hit
me and I just wrote it. Yeah.

1529
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:26,490
Like the first half of the book and
then a couple of weeks went by because I

1530
01:34:26,491 --> 01:34:30,120
wasn't quite sure about the ending.
Exactly.

1531
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:32,910
And then one night I woke up
before three 30 in the morning,

1532
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,200
I had the whole thing,
the rest of it.

1533
01:34:34,230 --> 01:34:35,790
And I sat down and I just
wrote the rest of it.

1534
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,400
It was like overflowing from
my brain and I just literally,

1535
01:34:41,401 --> 01:34:42,690
I just woke up and I wrote the,

1536
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:46,050
they took like two hours to finish
overflowing from your brain and your heart

1537
01:34:46,051 --> 01:34:47,350
and your soul.
Yeah.

1538
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,300
I don't know about all Monroe wake
up three 30 in the morning, come on.

1539
01:34:50,301 --> 01:34:51,900
And that's like a,
what do you call it?

1540
01:34:51,901 --> 01:34:55,960
Like an inspired creative genius types.

1541
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,250
I don't know about all that. Come
on, come on, come on, come on.

1542
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,900
But when I got done I was, I
could, I really like, I liked it.

1543
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,100
Like I realized it was something new.
It wasn't nothing.

1544
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:10,220
And as soon as my wife and kid,

1545
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:13,460
my wife and my youngest daughter
woke up that day and I was like, Hey,

1546
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:14,294
let me read this to you.

1547
01:35:14,340 --> 01:35:18,650
And I read it to him and I could tell
because as soon as I got done reading it,

1548
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,120
my daughter was like,
read it again,

1549
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:25,810
but was even funnier was my wife was
looking at me and the look on her face

1550
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,950
was basically a look of like, I can't
believe that you actually wrote that.

1551
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:38,510
She looked real suspect
and I was like,

1552
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:42,640
you know, I was waiting for it. It's like,
Oh, where'd you find that? Right. That,

1553
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:47,090
and so it was like, no, I
actually did write and I, and I,

1554
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:52,520
I read it to one of my seal buddies
who's got like really monotone voice,

1555
01:35:52,521 --> 01:35:54,620
but he's got young kids and
I'm awesome friends with them.

1556
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:58,830
And I got done with it and I was like
looking at it as I was looking, I'm,

1557
01:35:58,940 --> 01:36:01,190
as I'm reading, I'm not looking
at him, I'm looking at it right.

1558
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:05,060
And I get done and he's got this like
classic monotone voice and he's like,

1559
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,970
how did you even do that?
And I was like, okay.

1560
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:15,370
So that's kind of, you know, he was stoked
on it. And then I read it to you. Yes.

1561
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:19,820
And well, you heard it, Mikey and the
dragons. And when I first read it to you,

1562
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:20,640
cool.

1563
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:23,850
You read me one, it wasn't even done yet.
Oh. And it was like, I was like, Dang,

1564
01:36:23,851 --> 01:36:26,910
I was in first,
I kind of want a superficial level.

1565
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:30,530
I was impressed with your ability to
like actually rhyme stole. That's right,

1566
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:32,280
cause it runs. Yeah. Cause
you don't have some, you know,

1567
01:36:32,310 --> 01:36:35,700
one time like I dunno me how I'm going
to bust out some rhyme I made up.

1568
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:39,390
It's gonna be so far fetched.
Fred just do better with that.

1569
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,960
But yours is like, it
all fits. It's like yeah,

1570
01:36:42,961 --> 01:36:47,040
I understand how your friend was like,
like how did you do that or whatever.

1571
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:49,680
You know, cause it's just not, you can't
just throw words together that rhyme.

1572
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:53,250
But um, yeah. So here the
first version without the big,

1573
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:57,840
without the ending kind of thing. I read
that in the beginning and you were like,

1574
01:36:57,841 --> 01:37:00,630
hey there's more and there's an ending
or whatever that I didn't quite know.

1575
01:37:00,970 --> 01:37:05,580
I was like Dang, that's good. That is real
good actually because, and you, you up.

1576
01:37:05,590 --> 01:37:08,880
Cause you always have this little
message that's like real deep. You know,

1577
01:37:08,881 --> 01:37:13,881
that kind of applies to like a huge
message and it like it applies to kids

1578
01:37:14,491 --> 01:37:18,420
directly and then it applies to adults
directly though. That's the thing.

1579
01:37:18,421 --> 01:37:22,380
So you know how like, okay, so I read
kids book, I got kids, we all know that.

1580
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:27,180
And there's kids book, but the messages
is real simple mess. I don't know.

1581
01:37:27,181 --> 01:37:30,930
There's like a, I don't know,
whatever the little kid message,

1582
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:33,620
but it's like as an adult,
I'm not going to read that and be,

1583
01:37:33,690 --> 01:37:37,620
I learned that a long time ago. I learned
that when I was a kid. But these ones,

1584
01:37:37,621 --> 01:37:39,550
even all the worrier, kid
books or whatever, the bread,

1585
01:37:39,551 --> 01:37:43,320
these are adult messages for kids.
So that's what,

1586
01:37:43,321 --> 01:37:46,020
that's another thing I was like, Dang,
I was thinking that too bad. How do you,

1587
01:37:46,170 --> 01:37:49,470
how do you do that? You know? And then
I'm thinking, you know what happened?

1588
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,920
You were like scared of something like
bugs or something when you were living as

1589
01:37:52,921 --> 01:37:55,500
this what I was thinking in
my head, I don't know, maybe
we're maybe your, anyway,

1590
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:56,190
so

1591
01:37:56,190 --> 01:38:00,180
yeah, so the finished one, I
think I told you this year,

1592
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:02,550
when you read the finished one,
I was like, holy cow. That is,

1593
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:07,800
that is gold on so many levels. So what
I did was I stole the story, borrowed it,

1594
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:13,020
I borrowed, this is what you do, but it
works. So I borrowed the story. Obviously,

1595
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:14,910
I can't remember eyes,
the rhyming parts of it,

1596
01:38:14,911 --> 01:38:16,890
but I understand the story and story.
Yeah.

1597
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:20,110
I told the story to my daughter has a
bedtime story and like she's like, oh,

1598
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:22,620
she's like, oh are they show
all these questions. You know,

1599
01:38:22,621 --> 01:38:26,760
cause she thinks it's real. But
man, the lesson is so good. So good.

1600
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:31,440
Well from your reaction from act actually
read to them all of my older kids as

1601
01:38:31,441 --> 01:38:33,690
well.
And the same thing.

1602
01:38:33,691 --> 01:38:36,930
Super just like stoked on
it and a little bit of like,

1603
01:38:36,931 --> 01:38:41,880
did you actually write them, you know,
back kind of attitude. And when I,

1604
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:44,220
when I, when everyone kind of had
the same reaction, I was like, okay,

1605
01:38:44,221 --> 01:38:49,221
I need to get this into kids' hands as
quickly as possible because you know,

1606
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:53,360
it's the arc, typical story of
a, of a kid that, as you said,

1607
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:54,870
needs to overcome some fears.

1608
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:59,310
And it's also a story within a story.
Right?

1609
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:03,540
So basically the fundamental
thing is there's a, there's a boy,

1610
01:39:03,660 --> 01:39:07,470
his name is Mikey. He's scared of
everything. That's his basic situation.

1611
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:10,650
And here's how he gets
introduced in the book.

1612
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:13,890
It goes like this.

1613
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:17,550
There once was a little boy named Mike
and there were many things in the world

1614
01:39:17,551 --> 01:39:18,390
that he didn't like.

1615
01:39:18,510 --> 01:39:22,740
He was scared of spiders and beetles and
bugs and always thought they hit under

1616
01:39:22,741 --> 01:39:27,270
the rugs. They were creepy
and crawly and nasty and mean.

1617
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,850
And he ran from every bug he'd ever seen.

1618
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:33,360
But it wasn't only insects
that gave Mikey a scare.

1619
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,050
There were many other things
for which Mike didn't care.

1620
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:40,800
And that's sort of the opening. So you
learn a little bit about Mikey scared,

1621
01:39:40,830 --> 01:39:42,450
scared of some stuff,

1622
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:47,820
and eventually after you learn about all
the things that Mikey scared of and how

1623
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:48,690
he kind of is

1624
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:54,510
sad that he's scared of so many things,
you can do anything.

1625
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:56,880
And he kind of wonders why is
he so scared of everything?

1626
01:39:57,300 --> 01:40:00,720
And eventually he stumbles upon this
book and the book is that there's a book

1627
01:40:00,721 --> 01:40:03,080
that Mikey calls the Dragon Book.
Yeah.

1628
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,730
Even though the book itself
is called the Dragon Prince,

1629
01:40:08,731 --> 01:40:12,750
but he flips us book open for a second
and he sees pictures of dragons and the

1630
01:40:12,751 --> 01:40:15,650
dragons are all crazy.
And so he's a little bit scared,

1631
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:19,800
but there's also pictures of like a young
boy in there that kind of looks like

1632
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:24,420
he knows what's up. And so Mike,
he decides that he's gonna read it.

1633
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:27,270
And so this is where you get the story
within the story because then you,

1634
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:32,040
you turn the page and you see the cover
to this other book, Different Font,

1635
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,710
different voice,
different situation.

1636
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:39,400
The pictures look a little bit
different. That's cool. Cause I saw,

1637
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:40,260
I only saw some,

1638
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:44,560
I need to see the completed just some
of the pictures and you know Zach,

1639
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:49,260
you know, he knows what he's
doing in there. And anyways,

1640
01:40:49,261 --> 01:40:52,080
the story that's in within the story is
it turns out that there's this little

1641
01:40:52,081 --> 01:40:56,410
prince that loves nick, where the king,
who was the prince's dad has died.

1642
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:01,260
And of course everyone's all sad because
of that. But even more than being sad,

1643
01:41:01,261 --> 01:41:04,260
they're actually scared because it
was the king that always protected the

1644
01:41:04,261 --> 01:41:09,261
kingdom from the dragons who lived
over the hill in the dragon cave.

1645
01:41:10,860 --> 01:41:13,470
And with the king gone,
there's no one to protect the kingdom.

1646
01:41:13,710 --> 01:41:15,630
The knights are scared.
The guards were scared.

1647
01:41:15,780 --> 01:41:20,780
The only one that everyone is looking
to to protect the kingdom is this young

1648
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:26,400
prince. And here's how you get
introduced to that, to that. But now

1649
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:29,260
that the king had died in,
was gone,

1650
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:33,280
there was only one person to fight and
carry on and that person wasn't big or

1651
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:36,340
mighty. You are strong. In fact,
he hadn't been alive that long.

1652
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:41,620
Now the person who had dragons to chase
was just a little boy with a smiling

1653
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:42,910
face.
Yes.

1654
01:41:42,911 --> 01:41:47,911
The person that now must stand up and
be bold was just a little prince who was

1655
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,600
only seven years old.

1656
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:57,450
So the boy eventually realizes he's gonna
have to stand up and face the dragons.

1657
01:41:57,791 --> 01:42:01,840
He goes to his father's
war chest and opens it up.

1658
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:05,740
And of course the shields super
heavy in the store is massive.

1659
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:08,860
We can barely pick them up
and now he's even more scared.

1660
01:42:08,861 --> 01:42:12,790
But then he sees at the bottom of
the war chest, he sees a little note,

1661
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:17,440
little note from his dad,
the king, the mighty king,

1662
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:22,770
and the mighty king explains to the
son what he has to do to stand up.

1663
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,060
And face the dragons

1664
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:30,420
and the notes pretty
powerful in my opinion.

1665
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:36,480
And the prince goes forth into the fray
and through those lessons from his dad

1666
01:42:37,110 --> 01:42:41,190
and he faces the dragons and
we get a result from that.

1667
01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:44,550
And then the original character and story,
right

1668
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:50,130
Mikey,
he learns also how to face his fears.

1669
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:51,990
So that's the basic fundamental story.

1670
01:42:52,650 --> 01:42:55,530
And the way it came
together was pretty cool.

1671
01:42:55,531 --> 01:42:58,110
Other than the reactions from everyone
was pretty cool. So like I said,

1672
01:42:58,111 --> 01:43:00,720
I wanted to get it into people's
hands as quickly as possible possible.

1673
01:43:00,750 --> 01:43:05,460
So I talked to my publisher about this
and I told him about it and I was in the

1674
01:43:05,461 --> 01:43:09,120
middle of negotiating
some other books with them

1675
01:43:10,650 --> 01:43:13,290
and they of course were like,
Hey,

1676
01:43:13,291 --> 01:43:15,120
we've already got these books that
we're looking at. So you know,

1677
01:43:15,121 --> 01:43:18,870
we'll put this one on the back burner and
maybe we'll put it out in a year and a

1678
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:22,660
half. It was actually wasn't going
to 14 months. You didn't let me down.

1679
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:26,220
I didn't like that. I didn't like that. So
I said, no, you know, hey, it's all cool,

1680
01:43:26,221 --> 01:43:28,500
but I really want to get this one out
very quickly. I want to get this one out.

1681
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:30,510
This was in the summertime. I said,
I want to get this one out by,

1682
01:43:32,010 --> 01:43:35,430
I want to get this one out by let's get
the gift, get it to kids by Christmas,

1683
01:43:35,431 --> 01:43:37,380
right? This is an important
lesson for kids to learn.

1684
01:43:37,381 --> 01:43:39,330
Let's get it to them by Christmas.
Get Out November.

1685
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:44,770
Kids can get it for Christmas and learn.
And they're like,

1686
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,990
no. And, and if I go back and forth,

1687
01:43:47,650 --> 01:43:52,650
and finally the message I get is I get
message from my children's publisher

1688
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:57,200
because they're focused on other things.
It's the way it is.

1689
01:43:57,201 --> 01:43:59,540
They come back and say,
look, there's no scenario,

1690
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:04,400
no scenario where this
book comes out in November.

1691
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,140
There's no scenario where that
happens. And I said, Roger, that.

1692
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:14,870
And then I immediately formed
my own publishing company
called Jocko publishing.

1693
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:18,470
I talked to John Bozak who did
the art for the warrior kid books.

1694
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,280
And he was like, okay, we're
going, this is due now.

1695
01:44:22,940 --> 01:44:27,860
And he went into hyper creation mode.
And did the,

1696
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,040
the images are a lot different
than warrior kid because
of their full color and

1697
01:44:31,041 --> 01:44:34,970
their take up full pages and their
dragons and Crispin awesome this.

1698
01:44:35,690 --> 01:44:40,690
And he laid out the entire book and did
the art and colored it in about a month

1699
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:46,760
and a half. And now the book is
in fact coming out in November.

1700
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:53,300
So in the past when I would talk
about preordering book with, you know,

1701
01:44:53,301 --> 01:44:54,910
so you get the first edition whatnot.

1702
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,140
And I would always say the publisher
doesn't know it needs to know how many

1703
01:44:57,141 --> 01:45:01,310
books to print, which is true.
Now the person, the publisher,

1704
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,800
the person that needs to know how
many books to print is actually me.

1705
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:10,690
So if you want to get some,
you need to order it. Uh,

1706
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:16,270
people might think that this is dumb
on my part, which is fun to do this.

1707
01:45:16,271 --> 01:45:19,160
This is, it's like a lot of
taking on a lot of extra work.

1708
01:45:19,190 --> 01:45:20,750
Probably won't make as much money,

1709
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:25,250
should've done it on the normal polishing
release cycle so you can get more.

1710
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:28,430
Like they have a whole cycle. The way
they average. There's a whole thing.

1711
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:32,480
There's a whole thing to make the book
more popular in all of this stuff. Right.

1712
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,660
And I just had to look about it.
The bottom line is,

1713
01:45:37,661 --> 01:45:39,650
is I don't really care about
that and I'll tell you what,

1714
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:43,940
after doing book signings and you see
what the warrior kid book does for kids,

1715
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:50,170
I don't care about anything but trying
to get this book into as many kids hands

1716
01:45:50,631 --> 01:45:54,080
as possible. If I make
less money, whatever,

1717
01:45:54,110 --> 01:45:57,410
if it doesn't make the New York
Times best seller list, whatever,

1718
01:45:58,160 --> 01:46:03,160
because this isn't about making money
or it isn't about making the list or

1719
01:46:03,891 --> 01:46:06,380
whatever it's,
it's about these kids.

1720
01:46:06,410 --> 01:46:11,240
It's about teaching kids a core lesson
at a young age so that they can have a

1721
01:46:11,241 --> 01:46:14,000
better life.
Pretty Sturdy,

1722
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:17,870
pretty straightforward aim
goal. Mission. Yes sir.

1723
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:23,240
So if you've got a kid or you know a
kid or you just want to get after it and

1724
01:46:23,241 --> 01:46:28,241
support the cause over here of
discipline and justice and strengthen of

1725
01:46:31,611 --> 01:46:33,740
overcoming fears because
that's what the book is about,

1726
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:39,770
then jump on Amazon or this book,
it's called Mikey. And the dragons

1727
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:46,390
and I appreciate that cause it'll help
a lot of kids out and that is no matter

1728
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:52,710
what a good thing to do in this world,

1729
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:57,990
no matter what kind of
judgment you want to put,

1730
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,010
if you can help out of five year old,
a seven year old,

1731
01:47:02,130 --> 01:47:05,460
a four year old little kid,
man,

1732
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,570
that's worthwhile to me.

1733
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,910
So Mike in the dragons,
do you get get some

1734
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:20,910
now obviously we're going to help some
kids get on the path with that one.

1735
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:22,463
Um,

1736
01:47:23,790 --> 01:47:27,270
maybe echo you could recommend
some ways to get the, you know,

1737
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:31,790
basically the masses a little
bit tighter on the path. Yeah.

1738
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:36,570
Can you tell me and keep us on the
path really when it comes down to it,

1739
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:39,590
I liked it. Yeah. So yes.

1740
01:47:39,591 --> 01:47:42,330
So obviously well it is obvious.

1741
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:46,380
Like I said last time when we talk
about origin, you know, why? Cause what,

1742
01:47:46,381 --> 01:47:47,970
when you think of path we're thinking what

1743
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:53,420
fitness or how should I say capability.
I don't want to see fitness or whatever.

1744
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:58,110
Not just fitness. Yeah. It's like it's
like capability. That's what it is.

1745
01:47:58,230 --> 01:48:02,610
Capability and Jujitsu,
which is essentially it under
the umbrella of capability.

1746
01:48:03,180 --> 01:48:05,940
Somebody asked me today another interview,
I'm sure,

1747
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,930
how do you recommend men?

1748
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:12,120
It was like one of those
men centric interviews.

1749
01:48:13,260 --> 01:48:17,090
How do you recommend men
increase their confidence? Yes,

1750
01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:20,520
and I thought about it for a second and

1751
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:25,950
I, I was at first I was
kind of like, um, you know,

1752
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,470
I don't know that I need
to answer this question.

1753
01:48:28,471 --> 01:48:32,280
This is kind of one of those things.
And then I just thought to myself, okay,

1754
01:48:32,670 --> 01:48:35,850
realistically,
how do you increase someone's confidence?

1755
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,910
Cause it's kind of a throwaway
question in a way, right? Isn't it?

1756
01:48:38,911 --> 01:48:40,920
A little bit of a throwaway
question. It's like, Hey,

1757
01:48:40,921 --> 01:48:42,780
what magic pill do you
have to increase revenue?

1758
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:47,640
That's the answer that I think
was, was being hoped for. Yeah.

1759
01:48:47,641 --> 01:48:50,310
Let's hear Jockos version of it.
How do you increase your confidence?

1760
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:54,490
And let's put that as a, as a damn
bullet point on the Click Bait, right?

1761
01:48:54,720 --> 01:48:58,740
Navy seal tells you how to increase
your confidence. Right? Right.

1762
01:48:58,830 --> 01:49:02,310
It's a click bait all day long.
So I don't like those kinds of things.

1763
01:49:02,460 --> 01:49:06,210
But I thought about it for a
second. I thought to myself, okay,

1764
01:49:06,211 --> 01:49:10,860
where does confidence come from?
And then I rattled off. I was like,

1765
01:49:10,861 --> 01:49:13,260
well,
first of all,

1766
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,380
if you want to be confident,

1767
01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:21,830
then you should do things like
exercise and be physically fit.

1768
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:27,240
If you're physically fit, your confidence
will increase. You. Tell me Echo, Charles,

1769
01:49:27,270 --> 01:49:30,690
is that factual or or wrong?
That is factual. Okay,

1770
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:35,190
so if you increase your
physical capability,

1771
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:37,650
you'll be more confident.
If you learn how to fight,

1772
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:43,680
if you learn Jujitsu, Muay Thai boxing,
you will become more confident. A,

1773
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:48,370
does that sound like I'm a
meathead? Maybe? Guess what?
It's actually true. Yeah,

1774
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:50,080
it's actually 100% true.

1775
01:49:50,380 --> 01:49:55,270
If you're physically capable
and you actually know what
to do with your physical

1776
01:49:55,271 --> 01:49:58,420
capability in a confrontational situation,

1777
01:49:58,630 --> 01:50:03,190
you will become more confident. Okay,
so there's next. What else? Okay.

1778
01:50:03,400 --> 01:50:08,200
How about we learned to articulate
ourselves well. Go. Okay.

1779
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:09,580
Yes.
Will you be more confident?

1780
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:13,300
If you can speak clearly and concisely
and people can understand it? Yes,

1781
01:50:13,301 --> 01:50:17,140
you will become more confident. How do
you do that? You practice, you rehearse,

1782
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:18,550
you carry on conversations,

1783
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:23,670
you read a lot so that you have a better
vocabulary once you're done with that.

1784
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:25,810
What comes next?
Well

1785
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:32,680
do we lack confidence if we are
in the unknown? The answer is yes.

1786
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:37,160
How do you get more knowledge?
You study, you read you, you,

1787
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:42,220
you do your best to learn as much as
you can possibly learn and that will

1788
01:50:42,251 --> 01:50:45,880
increase your confidence because you'll
be more comfortable and more different

1789
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:48,540
situations cause you have more knowledge.
Yeah.

1790
01:50:48,940 --> 01:50:52,210
And the final thing is if you,

1791
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:56,260
one way of getting this as like
a self licking ice cream cone,

1792
01:50:56,261 --> 01:50:57,100
what I'm about to say,

1793
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:03,540
but if you have the confidence to say,

1794
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:05,590
I don't know,

1795
01:51:05,830 --> 01:51:10,830
your confidence will increase so I can
go and get interviewed by anybody because

1796
01:51:11,081 --> 01:51:16,030
worst case scenario I'll say, you
know, I don't know about that. I'm not,

1797
01:51:16,031 --> 01:51:18,040
I'm not, I don't actually
don't know anything about that.

1798
01:51:18,041 --> 01:51:20,110
I'm going to have to pass on
that question cause I'm not sure.

1799
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:23,500
Am I s is everyone in the world's supposed
to think that Jocko knows everything

1800
01:51:23,501 --> 01:51:27,050
in the world or am I,
can I keep,

1801
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:30,430
can I get in my humble enough
to admit that, you know what,

1802
01:51:30,431 --> 01:51:34,450
if you quiz me about every subject
in the world, I may not know it.

1803
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,760
Is that okay?
It's fine.

1804
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:41,590
No one expects me to be an expert in
anything in definitely not everything.

1805
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:45,430
Like I'm pretty good at a couple things,
but not an expert in anything.

1806
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:50,950
And so if you do those things,
you will become more confident.

1807
01:51:51,280 --> 01:51:54,550
Yeah. I thought that was pretty
straightforward. I think so too.

1808
01:51:54,700 --> 01:51:58,240
I think that's very, uh,
uh, she's an informative,

1809
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:02,670
they kind of get that kind of makes it
less impactful if I say informative,

1810
01:52:02,680 --> 01:52:05,770
but yet, yeah, no. Yeah.
There's also another aspect,

1811
01:52:05,771 --> 01:52:07,390
and I guess this is
covered by the other ones,

1812
01:52:07,391 --> 01:52:11,170
but like just stepping up
and leading sometimes. Yeah.
We'll get you better at it.

1813
01:52:11,410 --> 01:52:15,160
Right. Stepping up and talking in a group
of people, you'll get better at it. Yeah.

1814
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:20,180
So when you say like basically
like practice, rehearse,

1815
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:23,560
rehearse. Absolutely. So the, the
talking to people, that's a big one.

1816
01:52:23,561 --> 01:52:25,600
Like you know how someone will,
you'll have like, I don't know,

1817
01:52:25,601 --> 01:52:28,090
social anxiety and there's this,
it's a spectrum.

1818
01:52:28,091 --> 01:52:30,010
Some people have massive social anxiety,

1819
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:33,580
some people just prefer not a lot of
people be there, you know, kind of thing.

1820
01:52:33,850 --> 01:52:37,870
And it's a spectrum. Um, and, and
obviously real comment, right?

1821
01:52:37,871 --> 01:52:41,200
So yeah, if you want to increase
confidence, you say, okay,

1822
01:52:41,770 --> 01:52:46,010
in regards to the talking part, right? In
articulation practice, talking to people,

1823
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:49,610
like if you go to the store, this is kind
of a little mental exercise. They do.

1824
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:53,750
Do you get a lot done in the grocery
store? Let's hear the mental one.

1825
01:52:53,751 --> 01:52:55,190
There's a few things I actually do.

1826
01:52:56,290 --> 01:53:00,010
How do we increase confidence as a
drill in the grocery store? Okay. So,

1827
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:04,820
and I kinda got it from like being in
like Oregon and sometimes in Hawaii where,

1828
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:08,560
so in Oregon, right. Okay. So we'll
compare the two scenarios right. In,

1829
01:53:08,720 --> 01:53:12,210
in San Diego compared to Oregon in
San Diego. If I go in in the, I dunno,

1830
01:53:12,230 --> 01:53:16,460
frozen foods and someone else,
they're kind of in front of the peas,

1831
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:19,130
whatever I'm getting and I'm going to,
I'm going to politely,

1832
01:53:19,131 --> 01:53:21,650
hopefully politely wait for
them to finish and leave.

1833
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:24,710
But put bluntly,
that's like,

1834
01:53:24,711 --> 01:53:28,130
I'm going to wait for them to get out
of my way and so I can do what I have to

1835
01:53:28,131 --> 01:53:29,300
do. And then I'm going to, you know,

1836
01:53:30,020 --> 01:53:34,550
in Oregon you go to the frozen food
section and someone else's there,

1837
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:37,490
they're going to look into, hey, it's
almost like an attitude like, hey, here,

1838
01:53:37,510 --> 01:53:38,870
here to shoot.
What do you get?

1839
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:40,850
You're getting piece to
write on like kind of like,

1840
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:44,330
it's like they acknowledge
for lack of a better term,

1841
01:53:44,331 --> 01:53:46,400
celebrate the fact that you're
sharing space. You know,

1842
01:53:46,430 --> 01:53:50,100
like almost at the grocery store,
you don't kind of just put it,

1843
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:52,370
this is my interpretation or the field.
Right.

1844
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:56,480
So I kinda got that lesson
and I'm quite like that too.

1845
01:53:56,481 --> 01:53:59,420
But it's more because everyone kind of
knows each other, you know, or you know,

1846
01:53:59,421 --> 01:54:02,770
you seen the guy, your AA
and they say hi, that's the,

1847
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:07,590
so what I did was kind
of try to bring that, um,

1848
01:54:08,150 --> 01:54:12,820
I really liked it by the way,
the loss, the law spirit.

1849
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:17,960
Um, so now you go in the store and you're
just kind of sharing the same space.

1850
01:54:17,961 --> 01:54:20,930
So I'm not saying every single person
you pass, you're bothering them in, hey,

1851
01:54:20,931 --> 01:54:22,430
how's your, you know, that
stuff. I'm not saying,

1852
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:26,510
I'm saying if you're sharing their space,
say something to them,

1853
01:54:26,511 --> 01:54:28,220
acknowledge them politely.
Right.

1854
01:54:28,221 --> 01:54:32,360
Where were you have to
actively expend energy to say
something? Yes, but it's not,

1855
01:54:32,490 --> 01:54:35,600
there's this straight from
Dalton what I'm saying,

1856
01:54:35,601 --> 01:54:39,620
like actively like engage in their
world right there, you know, so,

1857
01:54:39,621 --> 01:54:43,160
and that goes for like kind of everyone
who's sharing space with you and you

1858
01:54:43,161 --> 01:54:46,610
know how like you're standing there in
line and you guys are just sort of avoid

1859
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:48,080
eye contact because you're just on your,

1860
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:50,240
your thing and they're on their thing
and we're going to stay out of each

1861
01:54:50,241 --> 01:54:53,210
other's way.
It's not like don't play it like that.

1862
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:57,810
Play it like hey like you make eye contact
say is say hi, you know, kind of thing.

1863
01:54:57,811 --> 01:55:00,860
It didn't try to do as genuine as possible
obviously cause you don't want them

1864
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:03,740
to think you're going to
catch them outside and sell
them something or something

1865
01:55:03,741 --> 01:55:06,080
like that. And then same thing
goes for like the cashier.

1866
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:10,130
Especially if you see him all the time
you use, you don't say the generic, hey,

1867
01:55:10,131 --> 01:55:13,100
how are you? Like that kind of yeah,
I dunno. Like make it for real.

1868
01:55:13,101 --> 01:55:15,740
Like you care about like, hey,
so how was it today? You know,

1869
01:55:15,741 --> 01:55:17,930
cause you know when you're a
cashier you see people after people.

1870
01:55:18,170 --> 01:55:21,320
If it gets crowded, that's something.
If it's real debt, that's something.

1871
01:55:21,321 --> 01:55:23,410
So you can say, hey, how was
it tonight? Wasn't a crowd.

1872
01:55:24,100 --> 01:55:27,260
I do that more than just a random people.
I don't,

1873
01:55:27,290 --> 01:55:29,540
I usually leave people alone
because I want to be left alone

1874
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:36,290
in the store. Don't, don't, don't mess
with you. Yes daddy your way, Bro.

1875
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:40,760
Stay out here with no about the cash
register, the, you know, the waitress,

1876
01:55:40,761 --> 01:55:44,400
the person behind the whatever
coffee thing or you know,

1877
01:55:44,401 --> 01:55:49,260
like I always try and just be nice to
them because I know that they're probably

1878
01:55:49,261 --> 01:55:52,770
having a not nice day because when you're
the cash register people are mad at

1879
01:55:52,771 --> 01:55:57,050
you already just cause there was a line
and you couldn't find the chocolate chip

1880
01:55:57,060 --> 01:56:00,290
discounted coupon thing. And so, you know,

1881
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:03,570
I like to give them a
little acknowledgement that
all good and that there's

1882
01:56:03,571 --> 01:56:07,260
actually humans out here that
are in the world and yeah,

1883
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:10,500
well it's the same concept and
I'm just in the, my point is that,

1884
01:56:10,530 --> 01:56:12,100
that's just where it Kinda came from.

1885
01:56:12,101 --> 01:56:14,940
So the whole point of this is just to
increase your confidence in communicating

1886
01:56:14,941 --> 01:56:17,370
with other humans. So when,
when you, when you do that,

1887
01:56:17,371 --> 01:56:21,960
the more and more you do that, the
more just, I would say comfortable.

1888
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:25,650
You get just talking to random
people, you know, like just people.

1889
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:28,230
It doesn't have to be your best friend.
And to start opening up a little bit.

1890
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:30,630
Obviously not everything,
but just, just a little bit.

1891
01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,720
So now you go into a
public place it Brian,

1892
01:56:33,721 --> 01:56:37,290
you're no stranger to talking
to strangers anymore, you know,

1893
01:56:37,291 --> 01:56:40,080
in the morning where you do it. So yeah,
you get more confident kind of like, Oh,

1894
01:56:40,081 --> 01:56:42,840
if this guy what rolls up to me? Yeah.
I have no problem talking to this guy.

1895
01:56:42,841 --> 01:56:44,910
I don't have social
anxiety. Yeah. What up, bro?

1896
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:48,140
You want to know how my day's going?
But I'll tell you. How's that? You know?

1897
01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:50,790
So it's that feeling and it
helped me while I'm over here.

1898
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:55,680
Why are you looking at me all I my way?
No respite.

1899
01:56:55,681 --> 01:56:59,370
The low spirit. Oh cool, cool.
And speaking of Aloha Spirit,

1900
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:00,870
what were we talking about Jujitsu?
Well,

1901
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:03,720
we weren't our confidence because in
order to increase your confidence,

1902
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:08,700
one absolute 100% way to increase
your confidence is to train Jujitsu.

1903
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:12,450
Yes. All Ages. All genders.

1904
01:57:12,990 --> 01:57:17,850
Let's just say to say safe for age four
and up age four and up. Yes, correct.

1905
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:22,400
Age for now. Below that is like, there's
exceptions from below. It's play time.

1906
01:57:22,540 --> 01:57:26,610
Yeah. Yes. Which just part of what you
just said too, by the way, as a kid. Yeah,

1907
01:57:26,740 --> 01:57:30,160
for sure. It should be fun, right?
Think about this as you do this right,

1908
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:33,240
you'll be able to relate to this.
So you know,

1909
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:36,810
like with your friends when you're
young, right? A kid, I don't know,

1910
01:57:36,811 --> 01:57:38,070
maybe eight nine,

1911
01:57:38,071 --> 01:57:43,071
10 1112 when you 1819 2023 whatever you
do when you're drunk at a party with

1912
01:57:43,771 --> 01:57:44,910
your friends,
it's all the same deal.

1913
01:57:45,390 --> 01:57:48,480
You guys get in little friendly
arguments and it's go time.

1914
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:50,430
You wrestle in the yard
or in the living room.

1915
01:57:50,431 --> 01:57:54,930
Then you went to in a seal platoon, so
you want to, it's on. Exactly right.

1916
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:58,080
And your parents say, hey,
take it outside. It's all
this thing he gets from fight.

1917
01:57:58,081 --> 01:58:02,790
I'll sit in the grass or
the dirt, whatever. And you
know who big fights usually.

1918
01:58:03,180 --> 01:58:07,740
Sometimes. Yeah, usually the
bigger brother or you know
your friend who's bigger,

1919
01:58:07,741 --> 01:58:10,860
usually he's going to get you right.
But it's fun. That's how it always,

1920
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:14,010
it's all fun and maybe you lose
your temper, maybe fight whatever,

1921
01:58:14,650 --> 01:58:19,410
all the little brother that can't take
care of the kids and he tries to like

1922
01:58:19,411 --> 01:58:22,500
kick you in the nuts, like, you know
what I mean? And you know what I mean?

1923
01:58:22,501 --> 01:58:25,230
That kid, I didn't know. It gets
all red in the face, bad temper,

1924
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:28,800
got to look out for himself,
wants to project the power,

1925
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:32,340
even though he's smaller than
everyone else because younger, sure.

1926
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:35,610
That happens occasionally and which
actually fits into what I'm about to say.

1927
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:39,740
So what Jujitsu is, it's basically
that, but the skill that,

1928
01:58:39,770 --> 01:58:42,460
that that's required to
win it, that, you know,

1929
01:58:42,610 --> 01:58:45,190
so we still have that need
like me and you right now,

1930
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:48,760
your whole point is to say that just
do fun. Yes. Yeah. Agreed. Okay.

1931
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:51,250
So now you've got to unpack
it because it's like,

1932
01:58:51,251 --> 01:58:52,910
you can see there's a lot
of things that are fun.

1933
01:58:56,620 --> 01:59:00,530
The thing is, but they didn't
know what kind of fun, you
know. So if I say, hey, um,

1934
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:04,360
you know, actually it's more fun
than that. Well, here's the fun.

1935
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:06,820
It's fun in a whole different level.
Right.

1936
01:59:06,850 --> 01:59:10,510
Well hear this though because it's fun
because you're connecting things together

1937
01:59:10,511 --> 01:59:14,800
that are part of a like grand,
right? It's like being a musician.

1938
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:17,500
It's like, Hey, here's the ref. Well,

1939
01:59:17,710 --> 01:59:21,850
yes there's that 100% but I think
just as a fundamental kind of,

1940
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:25,030
I don't want to say need
but want is like bro,

1941
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:26,920
like see how you're even
looking at me right now,

1942
01:59:26,970 --> 01:59:28,650
like where I kind of want
to fight you right now.

1943
01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:34,120
I don't want to like fight you like,
but I kind of want to fight you

1944
01:59:36,010 --> 01:59:39,460
as a friend. Like do you want to take it
on the match right now? Kind of thing.

1945
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:42,070
Like if we're like 10 years
old, he'd be like, what?

1946
01:59:42,071 --> 01:59:45,760
You want to take it outside
and throw you as friends?

1947
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:49,330
But that's all did you get to really is
that's really what it is. It's like, yeah,

1948
01:59:49,331 --> 01:59:53,230
let's go on the mat and let's basically
fight in a way that we don't burn our

1949
01:59:53,231 --> 01:59:57,130
each other's bridges and not be friends
anymore. And then, but on top of that,

1950
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:01,600
it's like they teach you the skill to do
that. That can literally save your life.

1951
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:06,460
Oh yeah. Literally at a minimum it will
increase your confidence as a human,

1952
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,720
as a human being. Yes sir. Sometimes it
gives you too much cost. Too much. Yes.

1953
02:00:10,721 --> 02:00:14,740
Especially early on,
especially if you're 13, 15,

1954
02:00:15,730 --> 02:00:16,563
21,

1955
02:00:16,860 --> 02:00:20,760
20 [inaudible] you start thinking you
could just smash everybody nonetheless.

1956
02:00:20,770 --> 02:00:25,060
So if you're training Jujitsu when you
change it, well if you're on the path,

1957
02:00:25,061 --> 02:00:28,300
that might be good too.
If you need you to gear,

1958
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:32,020
which you do need some Jujitsu gear,
you need it what's called a [inaudible].

1959
02:00:33,130 --> 02:00:36,310
If you need to g you can get a
[inaudible] from our company,

1960
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:39,130
which is based here in America.

1961
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:44,280
And we make gies all American from the
ground up from the dirt through it's

1962
02:00:46,541 --> 02:00:51,070
called origin main, best [inaudible]
ever in the world to ever,

1963
02:00:51,190 --> 02:00:54,700
ever in the history.
And if you need rash guards,

1964
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:59,290
which you can use for Jujitsu,
you can also use them for weightlifting.

1965
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:03,640
You can use them for running
and cycling, cycling, surfing,

1966
02:01:03,890 --> 02:01:08,140
uh, guitar playing. It might not
have, might not be necessary.

1967
02:01:08,590 --> 02:01:10,390
I do not wear rash guard
when I play guitar.

1968
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:15,600
Maybe I should maybe and those are also
made here in America along with what

1969
02:01:16,901 --> 02:01:18,520
else?
Just regular clothes too,

1970
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:22,330
like shirts and you know some athletic
wear but the shorts that I wear,

1971
02:01:22,331 --> 02:01:25,810
I only wear, well I have one pair of like
random, I'm old shorts. Oh by the way,

1972
02:01:25,811 --> 02:01:26,644
I'm going to get you some,

1973
02:01:26,770 --> 02:01:29,620
we got some new shorts coming and you're
going to be very excited about these

1974
02:01:29,621 --> 02:01:32,890
shorts. Well I already am because
every sin, even the error,

1975
02:01:32,900 --> 02:01:36,520
the mistake shorts that they made when
they were my favorite shirts literally

1976
02:01:36,521 --> 02:01:39,980
ever. And then they came out with
deliberate that they can actually

1977
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,230
sell. Not No, those are my
favorite shorts. So yeah you
say it or because he know,

1978
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,380
I bet Pete he cares.

1979
02:01:45,490 --> 02:01:48,320
You don't care about the fashion
stuff but they fashion subtleties.

1980
02:01:48,390 --> 02:01:52,850
Nothing to do with fit, fit style.
But it's subtle though. Anyway,

1981
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:56,210
they got a bunch of stuff on there,
a clothing wise as well,

1982
02:01:56,211 --> 02:01:59,840
like joggers and and you like the
joggers and then they got supplements.

1983
02:02:00,050 --> 02:02:03,890
We got supplements. Sure. We got
supplements. We've got joint warfare.

1984
02:02:04,610 --> 02:02:08,270
We got do you want word for is good. If
you're working out, if you're on the path,

1985
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:09,650
your joints are going to take a beating.

1986
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:13,850
Joint Warfare will protect
them and heal them.

1987
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:18,560
A krill oil. Another good
one. Discipline. Good.

1988
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:23,060
Pre-Operational get some,
get your mind right real quick.

1989
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:27,620
Get your body right. And then of course
we have a little something called Malke.

1990
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:33,260
Yes sir. We do. What is milk? Really
simple. It's smoke. Smoke. Yeah.

1991
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:38,280
So you know, um, you
know, coa. The kid, yeah.

1992
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:43,490
Happens to be my cousin.
He's on the path. Oh,

1993
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:47,170
the beginnings of the path
taking the first step.

1994
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:51,320
Trustingly got on the multi train as
the first step. That's an interesting,

1995
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:53,630
interesting.
But here's why though,

1996
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:57,020
when you're not really technically on
the path and you just drink Mulkey just

1997
02:02:57,021 --> 02:03:01,370
think you're drinking a milkshake.
See what I'm saying it for the taste.

1998
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:02,204
And that's a point.

1999
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:05,930
Which is good though because it will
keep you on the path in regards to that

2000
02:03:05,931 --> 02:03:07,430
additional protein that
you're going to get.

2001
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:10,040
The original flavor was mint chocolate.
My favorite.

2002
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:15,110
We went to peanut butter from there
available then vanilla gorilla.

2003
02:03:16,190 --> 02:03:20,420
I don't like plain vanilla. I don't,
I just don't like, I don't want to,

2004
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:23,450
I don't want to eat vanilla
anything like you unless,

2005
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:25,760
unless I'm meeting with
some damn chocolate cake.

2006
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,970
I'm not going to order
vanilla ice cream ever.

2007
02:03:29,420 --> 02:03:32,530
The other day when you
had a cake situation,

2008
02:03:32,890 --> 02:03:37,010
cake scenario in some ice cream and ice
cream, it was vanilla. There you go.

2009
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:41,330
And that whole scenario, just on
the folded wrong, it really did.

2010
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:46,370
I just rationalized the whole
thing. Lied to myself. Just again,

2011
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:50,540
just got after it. But what?
Well here's what bummed me out.

2012
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:53,710
As soon as I was done I was like,
well I was on the road, no milk.

2013
02:03:54,290 --> 02:03:56,900
So when you don't have dessert,
sometimes you get that little, oh,

2014
02:03:56,901 --> 02:04:01,310
I'd like a little something that
tastes good too to wash down the stake.

2015
02:04:01,770 --> 02:04:05,480
That's a good state. And then, and then
there's no milk cause I'm on the road.

2016
02:04:05,570 --> 02:04:07,550
I got to figure that out.
I got to figure that out.

2017
02:04:07,580 --> 02:04:09,980
People give me good suggestions. I know
I can put a little baggy in the thing.

2018
02:04:09,980 --> 02:04:12,740
And just grab some milk
somewhere, mix it up, no factor.

2019
02:04:12,890 --> 02:04:16,760
So I need to start doing that. Uh,
nonetheless. You don't like vanilla,

2020
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,940
so no vanilla is not my favorite flavor.

2021
02:04:20,240 --> 02:04:22,490
The Vanilla tastes good.

2022
02:04:23,210 --> 02:04:26,660
I was not the judge on the vanilla.
You know,

2023
02:04:27,170 --> 02:04:31,820
Pete and Brian were like
a, the is awesome. I said
I'll try it. It tastes fine.

2024
02:04:31,880 --> 02:04:35,930
I'm not the judge cause I don't want
to judge something that I don't fully

2025
02:04:35,931 --> 02:04:39,300
comprehend. I'm not deserving
of being a vanilla judge.

2026
02:04:39,450 --> 02:04:43,740
So therefore I didn't do it. And,
but the darkness, which is chocolate,

2027
02:04:43,890 --> 02:04:47,130
the darkness that is
also freaking delicious.

2028
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:50,640
And when you're getting this stuff,

2029
02:04:51,570 --> 02:04:55,740
you'll be getting it from origin main.
You got to Cindy up there. You met Cindy.

2030
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:58,950
Of course she's fired up.
So when you're getting your stuff packed,

2031
02:04:58,951 --> 02:04:59,970
it's not just being,

2032
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:05,100
it's not just being randomly
placed in a box by a robot.

2033
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:09,990
No, Cindy's up there. She's getting after
it. And I'm going to say one more thing.

2034
02:05:10,020 --> 02:05:12,950
Little announced announcement.
Little announcement. So you,

2035
02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:15,120
you remember when you were a little kid?
Yes.

2036
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:18,530
And you loved chocolate milk?
Yes.

2037
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:21,750
And he loves strawberry milk
being loved it so much, whatever,

2038
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,030
whatever little brand name that you got.

2039
02:05:24,031 --> 02:05:28,920
And there was a couple of them that were
prominent and they tasted delicious and

2040
02:05:28,921 --> 02:05:32,040
it was like desert. And for some reason
you didn't really understand why,

2041
02:05:32,041 --> 02:05:34,710
but your parents would actually
allow you to drink it all the time

2042
02:05:36,330 --> 02:05:37,560
because your parents thought,
well you know,

2043
02:05:37,561 --> 02:05:39,300
it's kind of milking it so
it's gotta be good to go.

2044
02:05:41,200 --> 02:05:43,680
It'll make their bones strong and
just a little protein in there,

2045
02:05:43,681 --> 02:05:44,910
so we'll just let them drink it.

2046
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:49,500
What they didn't realize is that little
chocolate and strawberry milk that you

2047
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:54,501
were drinking as a kid is completely
filled with sugar and high fructose corn

2048
02:05:56,611 --> 02:05:59,550
syrup and a bunch of other chemicals
that they couldn't even pronounce.

2049
02:06:00,750 --> 02:06:02,670
And so the milk that your parents,

2050
02:06:02,671 --> 02:06:07,671
my parents were allowing me to drink was
actually a freaking net loss overall to

2051
02:06:09,071 --> 02:06:13,830
my health because it was
filled with poison, but it
tasted good and you loved it.

2052
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:16,290
It was like a dessert you
could have all the time,

2053
02:06:18,990 --> 02:06:21,540
but it was filled with poison.
So you know, we did, we fixed it.

2054
02:06:22,410 --> 02:06:27,410
We fixed it and we now have
available at this time warrior kid.

2055
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:35,730
Yes, Warrior kid milk. We made
chocolate and we made strawberry.

2056
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:39,450
Just like you remember when you were a
kid only instead of having a bunch of

2057
02:06:39,451 --> 02:06:43,650
garbage in it, it's got protein,
extra protein, 12 grams.

2058
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:46,350
It's got vitamins that you need.

2059
02:06:46,590 --> 02:06:50,790
It's got probiotics because kids
are getting told all the time they,

2060
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,670
their parents are getting told they need
to take probiotics and here take this

2061
02:06:53,671 --> 02:06:56,220
pill and that pill,
no take warrior kid moke

2062
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:02,430
and there's no sugar in it
and it tastes freaking amazing.

2063
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:03,563
So

2064
02:07:04,680 --> 02:07:09,060
it's better than any other
of these flavored whatever
chocolate milk you grew up

2065
02:07:09,061 --> 02:07:10,170
on,
this taste better.

2066
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:16,030
So now your or your kid out
there can get on the milk train.

2067
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,290
It's awesome.
And again,

2068
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:24,470
for me to see kids and be able to
help out kids that are four years old,

2069
02:07:25,591 --> 02:07:29,280
six years old, eight years old, to
give them something that's healthy,

2070
02:07:29,281 --> 02:07:33,600
that tastes good, that's going to
make them stronger and healthier.

2071
02:07:33,690 --> 02:07:35,710
I mean this is what it's all about.
So

2072
02:07:36,550 --> 02:07:41,550
order up some warrior kid milk
for your children available.

2073
02:07:42,881 --> 02:07:47,410
Now my kid's going straight on the mock
trial. Yeah, for sure. One way ticket.

2074
02:07:48,690 --> 02:07:50,860
Does that apply when we
take it on? Yeah. Yeah.

2075
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:54,790
You understand what it was
to totally fully the Vanessa.

2076
02:07:54,791 --> 02:07:59,510
Speaking of which my son, two years old,
by the way, I liked the vanilla as more.

2077
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:01,570
I didn't know.
I'm like,

2078
02:08:01,571 --> 02:08:05,920
should I give my son that
much additional protein?

2079
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:08,260
You know,
you even questioned that.

2080
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:14,110
I just don't know a lot of things, you
know as far in regards to either way, so,

2081
02:08:14,170 --> 02:08:17,950
okay. Yes. Kids on milk train on
the path. Kids are on the path. Yes.

2082
02:08:17,951 --> 02:08:21,670
Straight and want to be at that book
signing there. There wasn't many.

2083
02:08:21,700 --> 02:08:24,850
There weren't many kids. They're the
ones that I did on the east coast.

2084
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:29,320
Lots of kids in, tons of kids. All of
them on the path fired up, man. It was,

2085
02:08:29,680 --> 02:08:34,190
it was amazing. Every kid there
last night at was not in the path.

2086
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:35,133
Huge time.

2087
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:39,250
One kid literally tried to challenge
me to a Jujitsu match on more than one

2088
02:08:39,251 --> 02:08:42,790
occasion and I'm not even joking like for
real attitude, which I dug by the way.

2089
02:08:42,791 --> 02:08:44,560
I mean I couldn't engage
them cause you know,

2090
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:47,550
I mean you're getting all
this challenge me double

2091
02:08:50,210 --> 02:08:54,230
get away. Okay. Kids on the
vessel, which brings me to our uh,

2092
02:08:54,310 --> 02:08:58,920
store Jocko has a store, it's
called Jocko store. Right.

2093
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,880
Pretty straight forward. Anyway, there is,

2094
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,200
there are where your kid rash
guards for when they joined Jujitsu.

2095
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:08,080
No Geek part of it.
Rash guards on there.

2096
02:09:08,081 --> 02:09:11,230
There's obviously where he could shirts
if they're in the geek part of it.

2097
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,960
That's cool. You got to origin
main.com and you get him,

2098
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:18,830
you get him the warrior [inaudible] get
some boom and also new edition for where

2099
02:09:18,831 --> 02:09:23,410
are your kids patches on there right
now if you went literally right now you

2100

your g for your backpack,

2101
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:31,150
obviously, wherever you
want to put it. But yeah,

2102
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:34,340
the little round one and long kind of
Jujitsu and made kind of four digits you,

2103
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,040
but you can put it wherever want anyway.
Yeah.

2104
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:41,160
It's on [inaudible] dot com also on
Jocko store.com is where you can get your

2105
02:09:42,071 --> 02:09:43,900
shirts,
disciplining freedom.

2106
02:09:44,010 --> 02:09:46,980
This is one of the thing about
shirts is everyone wears shirts. Yes.

2107
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:50,450
Even if you don't want to wear one, which
I don't like wearing a shirt. Hell no,

2108
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:55,270
but I you sometimes you got to wear
a shirt. Everyone needs a shirt.

2109
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:58,810
Might as well be you. Kind of a cool
one. Might as little reminders. Yeah,

2110
02:09:58,930 --> 02:10:02,480
big time and truckers hats.
Chuck has hands on them.

2111
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:07,060
Just completely stoked on my discipline
equals freedom hat or the def core hats

2112
02:10:07,061 --> 02:10:11,740
out yet the difficult cats are should
be done. Are they live? I don't know.

2113
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:13,100
Okay.
I got there was,

2114
02:10:13,810 --> 02:10:17,620
there was a technical thing where
like the logo and get, you know,

2115
02:10:17,621 --> 02:10:21,370
cause hats have panels, a certain
amount of panels and you know the logo.

2116
02:10:21,371 --> 02:10:22,660
Does it fit on this dis,

2117
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:27,780
does it go on the scene or do we need
a different panel hat now anyway,

2118
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:32,320
it's very tactical. Well, but
nonetheless the DEF core hat is out soon.

2119
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:34,070
That's deep representing right there.

2120
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:39,650
What about the deaf court shirt? Is there
a pure def course shirt? Black cops. Ah,

2121
02:10:39,651 --> 02:10:40,800
yes.
And then

2122
02:10:41,590 --> 02:10:46,330
I was thinking a one called def core
declassified. It's just white on white,

2123
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:51,320
whatever. Black out. You see what
I'm saying? Anyway? Well, you know.

2124
02:10:51,550 --> 02:10:53,530
Yeah. You know, I'm going
to have to ask that.

2125
02:10:53,531 --> 02:10:55,720
We all kind of just kinda
checked back on that one.

2126
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,060
Maybe it's like maybe
it's not none the less.

2127
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:00,610
If you go there and you
want to represent hardcore,

2128
02:11:01,660 --> 02:11:04,720
that's where you can get your shirt or
Hoodie new hoodie on the way, by the way.

2129
02:11:05,110 --> 02:11:08,860
Oh yeah. Duty heavy duty,
heavy duty techniques.

2130
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:14,360
This better be good.
That's the thing.

2131
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:17,800
Anyway, hoodies on there. A
lot of cool stuff on there.
Oh, and I did the research.

2132
02:11:17,801 --> 02:11:21,130
Who, what? What's better? What do people
literally, what do people like better?

2133
02:11:21,220 --> 02:11:25,970
Flex fit hat. Oh, trucker
hat. Even even Steven. Okay,

2134
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:27,430
cool.
Actually there's like,

2135
02:11:27,630 --> 02:11:32,020
I think two more people historically
speaking like the snap back,

2136
02:11:32,170 --> 02:11:35,160
so technically you're
right. Yes. Nonetheless.

2137
02:11:35,161 --> 02:11:38,550
We've got some rash guards in there
as well. Also, we got on the podcast,

2138
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:42,690
subscribe to it wherever. No, don't
forget the warrior kid podcast.

2139
02:11:42,780 --> 02:11:44,430
A lot of people don't know about that yet.

2140
02:11:44,431 --> 02:11:49,431
So spread the word on the warrior kid
podcast will questions from uncle Jake for

2141
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:55,380
Uncle Jake and little stories from Uncle
Jake about how he developed his sort of

2142
02:11:55,381 --> 02:11:58,790
values in the world.
That's the warrior kid bond cast,

2143
02:11:59,460 --> 02:12:04,460
the warrior kids soap from Irish
oaks ranch.com at young Aden,

2144
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:09,450
the warrior kid milking goats,
making soap,

2145
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:14,700
getting after it,
order some of that so you can stay clean.

2146
02:12:15,060 --> 02:12:18,750
Also youtube checkout echos,

2147
02:12:18,840 --> 02:12:21,270
legit enhanced videos,

2148
02:12:22,650 --> 02:12:25,110
which some people like
some people like them.

2149
02:12:25,650 --> 02:12:30,240
Most people I'd say like you don't get a
lot of thumbs down on your videos. Yeah,

2150
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:34,530
the annual, what I like is when
someone funds down your video, there's,

2151
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:37,840
there's multiple people in the
comments that'll be like, Ooh,

2152
02:12:38,460 --> 02:12:40,660
well down this aisle communist.

2153
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:44,333
So that's good.

2154
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:49,810
We've got some plans for the youtube
going to step it up a little bit. Yeah,

2155
02:12:49,920 --> 02:12:52,260
a little bit more I should say, cause
he was stepped it up a little bit. Yeah,

2156
02:12:52,620 --> 02:12:54,210
we're gonna step it up a little bit more.
Yeah.

2157
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:59,400
I think videos just in general are
like fun to watch and it could be just

2158
02:12:59,401 --> 02:13:00,234
speaking for myself,

2159
02:13:00,610 --> 02:13:05,010
but I would tend to agree with you and
also psychological warfare working on

2160
02:13:05,250 --> 02:13:09,960
album number two, psychological warfare.
We're aiming for a Christmas release.

2161
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:13,020
If you have any suggestions, hit
me up on Twitter. In the meantime,

2162
02:13:13,021 --> 02:13:15,000
you got the psychological
warfare one album,

2163
02:13:15,001 --> 02:13:17,460
which can help you get through
whatever little moments of weakness.

2164
02:13:17,490 --> 02:13:22,260
I wish I had it the other day for that
cake and my brain with ice cream to watch

2165
02:13:22,261 --> 02:13:22,700
out for that.

2166
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:25,020
It was good about that. You
learn, it seemed like anyway,

2167
02:13:25,021 --> 02:13:29,370
according to your post and you that you
learned a little lesson and you're open

2168
02:13:29,371 --> 02:13:31,620
about it too. Yeah. That's good. Yeah.

2169
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:34,890
It can't be like hiding your
failures in an actor like no,

2170
02:13:34,891 --> 02:13:39,330
cause I'm saying because I'm human. Yeah.
Yeah. Anyone that thinks I'm not human,

2171
02:13:39,390 --> 02:13:41,400
you're wrong.
I'm all too human.

2172
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:47,060
I get tapped out in
Jujitsu I get and what?

2173
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:50,040
You know what I mean?
I mean it's like, yeah,

2174
02:13:50,070 --> 02:13:52,170
hey and you pound huge pieces of the cake.

2175
02:13:52,180 --> 02:13:54,390
We every once in awhile
cake with ice cream.

2176
02:13:55,710 --> 02:14:00,630
So disappointed in myself any way.
Stay on the path is what I'm saying.

2177
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:02,190
I'm also,
if you're,

2178
02:14:02,191 --> 02:14:07,191
if you're incorporating kettle bell
workouts in various ring workouts,

2179
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:09,203
I'll tell you where you can get them.

2180
02:14:09,210 --> 02:14:12,300
Get them from on it on
it.com/jocko by the way,

2181
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:15,510
I incorporate rings every single day.
Every single day.

2182
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:18,800
You're all on the ring for ads and core
power. It's good and I can't quite,

2183
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:21,720
I can almost do pull ups again.
Oh look my bicep or whatever.

2184
02:14:21,721 --> 02:14:24,410
But muscle ups coming to
Muslims coming in action.

2185
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:29,170
Know that honestly my shoulders
getting back up to speed. Yeah.

2186
02:14:29,290 --> 02:14:32,610
Cause it went through a
little down period. Then it
got, then it got the healed.

2187
02:14:32,611 --> 02:14:36,550
Now that I tweaked it again
doing something stupid.
You know what I did? Yeah.

2188
02:14:36,551 --> 02:14:38,190
I eat ice cream. That's good.
You know I didn't do that.

2189
02:14:38,191 --> 02:14:43,191
I edit a massive numbers of weighted
dips super deep and in a mess up you

2190
02:14:44,641 --> 02:14:46,350
shoulder messed up my
shoulder. Oh okay. That was,

2191
02:14:46,530 --> 02:14:48,020
that was like six months ago or something.

2192
02:14:48,021 --> 02:14:51,730
And he was a long time ago dealing with
it. But finally it's coming back around.

2193
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:54,120
Yeah. And shoulders pain
in the ass, man. Yeah.

2194
02:14:54,200 --> 02:14:56,520
You've got to make do the maintenance
man and you've got to do the maintenance

2195
02:14:56,521 --> 02:15:00,420
and I don't do enough of it. Need to do
more of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah,

2196
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:01,531
go there.
That's the,

2197
02:15:01,531 --> 02:15:05,430
you can get some cool workout stuff and
actually good travel workout stuff too.

2198
02:15:05,460 --> 02:15:07,530
Like those written, well you
already said this. I know,

2199
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:10,480
but I'm slowly come to
the realization that you,

2200
02:15:10,690 --> 02:15:14,100
when you travel with rings but opens
up your whole travel game changer.

2201
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:17,490
Game Changer.
You know if you're working out too,

2202
02:15:17,491 --> 02:15:21,330
when you're working on that dead lift,
one thing you can do is if you probably,

2203
02:15:21,600 --> 02:15:26,280
if you're stuck at like a 4,000 pound dead
lift plateau, no, we can't accept that.

2204
02:15:26,580 --> 02:15:30,480
Get Jocko white tea and
it comes with a guarantee.

2205
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:32,250
I don't know what kind of guarantee.

2206
02:15:32,460 --> 02:15:36,060
So you can deadlift 8,000
pounds immediately. Probably
take you like four sips.

2207
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,100
Yeah.
If you can't define,

2208
02:15:38,400 --> 02:15:42,030
if you can't deadlift 8,000 pounds
after drinking Jocko white tea,

2209
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:45,640
either the ones in a can
or the ones in a teabag,

2210
02:15:47,260 --> 02:15:48,930
uh,
that you can get them on Amazon.

2211
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:51,630
If you can't think your deadlift
isn't 8,000 pounds after that,

2212
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:56,610
just drink more and you'll get
there. Yes. Also got some books.

2213
02:15:56,700 --> 02:16:00,900
Obviously the way the warrior kid books
that the first one way of the warrior

2214
02:16:00,901 --> 02:16:05,760
kid. The second one is Mark's mission,
which is the best book. And I'm going,

2215
02:16:05,761 --> 02:16:06,594
if I'm going to say it,

2216
02:16:06,640 --> 02:16:09,510
I'm going to say it's a bold statement
and in fact I was debating whether or not

2217
02:16:09,511 --> 02:16:12,420
to actually say it out loud.
That's the best book in the world.

2218
02:16:12,510 --> 02:16:14,670
Straight up March mission mission.
The second one.

2219
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:20,730
You okay. So I'm reading it to buy,
we've just finished it a week ago.

2220
02:16:20,760 --> 02:16:23,640
Oh is this your first time finishing it?
Finishing it yet. Okay. Well we could.

2221
02:16:23,641 --> 02:16:25,700
Interesting. Interesting. So, um,

2222
02:16:25,890 --> 02:16:28,260
well cause we jumped around to
another book and it's a long story,

2223
02:16:28,261 --> 02:16:30,160
but nonetheless. Yeah.
So finished it. Right.

2224
02:16:30,460 --> 02:16:34,000
So you know why though now
that I'm searching my feelings,

2225
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:41,680
it starts to address a little bit more
sophisticated issues that you can go

2226
02:16:41,681 --> 02:16:44,890
through. You know, even though when you
think you got it figured out, you know,

2227
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:48,290
you're taking Jujitsu now and you can do
pull ups and all this stuff or what are

2228
02:16:48,291 --> 02:16:50,950
you sort of address those a
little bit more advanced issues.

2229
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:55,970
Sophisticated but like the depth of which
like these issues go and the way you

2230
02:16:58,601 --> 02:17:03,490
got to solve them or like the way it's
simplified in broken down to kids or to

2231
02:17:03,610 --> 02:17:07,030
whoever's reading it because quite frankly
it's broken down to me in this case,

2232
02:17:07,180 --> 02:17:10,660
um, is like, it's pretty, we'll
just say it's pretty interesting,

2233
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:15,220
but at the same time it, you glorify
things like hard work, right?

2234
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,980
In a way that it actually makes
the kid want to work hard.

2235
02:17:18,190 --> 02:17:20,170
You know what I'm saying? So
it's like, yeah, getting a job,

2236
02:17:20,171 --> 02:17:23,460
like go mow lawns and pull weeds
by the way, which if we, you know,

2237
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:25,720
we all know that when you did that
as a kid, you're like, no bro,

2238
02:17:25,721 --> 02:17:29,310
we don't want to do that. Is
a form of punishment. Yeah.

2239
02:17:29,390 --> 02:17:33,940
And my house exactly right. This
time after reading that part, um,

2240
02:17:34,090 --> 02:17:37,300
my daughter, by the way, she
wants to pull weeds. She's,

2241
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:41,500
she's salty cause she doesn't have a job
mowing lawns and pulling weeds. Yeah.

2242
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:44,890
And he makes work for, he's like,
he's like $40. I made $40. Right.

2243
02:17:44,891 --> 02:17:48,220
Like exclamation point. She's like, oh my
gosh, you made $40. I want to make $40.

2244
02:17:48,250 --> 02:17:52,540
You know, just the way it's laid out,
how simple. But you know, I'm really,

2245
02:17:52,550 --> 02:17:57,430
I'm getting into it and it, I see
it affecting it, um, my daughter.

2246
02:17:57,490 --> 02:18:01,390
So then it moves onto the Jujitsu part
and this part affected me. You know,

2247
02:18:01,391 --> 02:18:03,190
it's like,
well let's face it.

2248
02:18:03,370 --> 02:18:06,100
That's why when you get nervous in
Jujitsu with tournaments or whatever,

2249
02:18:06,130 --> 02:18:06,881
like there was a,

2250
02:18:06,881 --> 02:18:09,640
I remember when I was competing and
strangely I was competing a lot too.

2251
02:18:10,380 --> 02:18:12,760
Like maybe two, three weeks.
There was a tournament back then.

2252
02:18:13,110 --> 02:18:17,230
Wasn't as often as no, but,
um, and I would be competing,

2253
02:18:17,470 --> 02:18:21,310
but every single one seems
like we're driving there.

2254
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:25,420
And if like my wife who was, I
think my girlfriend at the time, um,

2255
02:18:25,810 --> 02:18:28,510
and my brother, whoever was driving it
was, if they're talking about other stuff,

2256
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:31,760
I'm like getting mad at him cause
I'm like told, you realize man,

2257
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:35,530
it's like that idea, you know? And
I'm like, I don't behave that way.

2258
02:18:35,531 --> 02:18:38,500
But that's what's been
on my mind and tangible.

2259
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:43,150
Small but tangible part of my mind is
like hoping that like the Jim Burke down

2260
02:18:43,151 --> 02:18:46,390
when we got there, like I just don't want
to, you know, it's like that, it's weird.

2261
02:18:46,810 --> 02:18:49,910
But then the way like you lay out
because mark didn't want to compete in a

2262
02:18:49,911 --> 02:18:52,120
tournament. Right. And the way
you lay out and you really,

2263
02:18:52,121 --> 02:18:57,010
it's a call out is what it is. It's like
you're calling out. He's like, I'm afraid.

2264
02:18:57,011 --> 02:18:59,740
But it's like you're not afraid of
Jujitsu. You do Jiu Jitsu every day,

2265
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,760
full speed by the way. And you're not
afraid of juice. You're afraid of losing.

2266
02:19:04,490 --> 02:19:08,530
And guess what? Those things,
okay. It really hit me anyways.

2267
02:19:08,740 --> 02:19:11,140
And then from there to me
from then on it was like,

2268
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:15,250
and how it culminate has good man. It's
straight out the best book in the world.

2269
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:18,760
I'll give it to you. Don't want
to, but nevermind. Cormac McCarthy,

2270
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:21,820
nevermind about where the warrior king,

2271
02:19:22,030 --> 02:19:24,580
they also got the discipline
equals freedom field manual.

2272
02:19:25,870 --> 02:19:28,100
How to get after it for adults.

2273
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:31,100
And actually a lot of kids read this book.
That's where they graduate.

2274
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:34,880
They graduate from Warrior Kid. I talked
to a lot of parents and they're like,

2275
02:19:34,940 --> 02:19:36,530
oh yeah,
once you know,

2276
02:19:36,531 --> 02:19:40,760
now he's 14 he just read discipline
equals freedom field manual.

2277
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:43,250
So that's the,
that's the graduate.

2278
02:19:43,251 --> 02:19:46,820
Can Imagine if you had that book when
you were 14 game changer, game changer.

2279
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:51,500
Right. Anyone, and I'll tell you
right now the warrior, that one,

2280
02:19:51,880 --> 02:19:55,320
yeah, yeah. No, the feedback
that I get from it, but the,

2281
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:57,800
it's the same kind of
feedback I get from the kids,

2282
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:00,770
from the field manual of
people that are like, hey,

2283
02:20:01,520 --> 02:20:03,530
I read this every day.

2284
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:08,270
I read two pages this every day so I
can keep my mind right. Yeah. That,

2285
02:20:08,290 --> 02:20:09,500
and that's how that works.

2286
02:20:09,530 --> 02:20:13,250
Like that's the one you refer it back to
everyday or every other day or whatever.

2287
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:15,110
That's their guy.
Hit me up on Twitter.

2288
02:20:15,111 --> 02:20:18,830
Remember that story I told about being
a Yosemite and the dude was in the river

2289
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:20,300
and he's like, I was like, oh.

2290
02:20:20,301 --> 02:20:23,990
He recognized me and I was getting
all fired up with him and he was like,

2291
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:29,000
I'm here to get my mind right.
I was like, year. Anyways, guys,

2292
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:33,890
friend hit me up on Twitter and that
dude's name is meth. That's his name.

2293
02:20:33,891 --> 02:20:38,830
His name is math. Math, math. I. M.
E. T. H. Like the dried up. Yeah.

2294
02:20:38,860 --> 02:20:42,770
Got It. Well, he was not a meth user.

2295
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:46,880
It just happens to be his
name. Gotcha. Uh, okay.

2296
02:20:46,881 --> 02:20:48,890
Then also extreme ownership.

2297
02:20:49,040 --> 02:20:53,060
Obviously that's the first book wrote
with my brother Leif Babin and we followed

2298
02:20:53,061 --> 02:20:56,480
that book up very recently with a book
called the dichotomy of leadership.

2299
02:20:56,510 --> 02:20:59,600
There's a million interviews on it
we talked about on this podcast.

2300
02:21:00,230 --> 02:21:05,230
That book is going to really help leaders
finish out strong and then of course

2301
02:21:09,170 --> 02:21:11,270
coming out November,
order it now,

Charles and I am at jockowillink
and thanks to all military police,

2323
02:22:37,891 --> 02:22:42,180
law enforcement, correctional
officers, firefighters, border patrol,

2324
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:45,360
paramedics, all first
responders. It was great meeting.

2325
02:22:45,361 --> 02:22:47,460
So many of you at roll call.
It was,

2326
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:51,540
it was just awesome to meet you all and
did a bunch of the other events I've

2327
02:22:51,541 --> 02:22:53,730
done in the past couple of weeks
that book signings and whatnot,

2328
02:22:54,930 --> 02:22:59,370
knowing that you all are out there
holding the line and watching our six in

2329
02:22:59,371 --> 02:23:01,470
protecting our flanks is awesome.

2330
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:04,260
And it'll tell you what I
do not take it for granted.

2331
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:09,150
I do not take it for granted that
you're there and no one should.

2332
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:14,960
So thanks to you all for doing what you
do and for everyone else that is out

2333
02:23:15,061 --> 02:23:15,894
there.

2334
02:23:17,320 --> 02:23:22,320
Remember the way and remember that you
can use it everywhere in everything that

2335
02:23:23,771 --> 02:23:28,510
you do.
So find the enemies weak points,

2336
02:23:28,570 --> 02:23:32,410
attack the enemy violently.
Be Bold and decisive,

2337
02:23:32,470 --> 02:23:34,390
seize and hold the initiative.

2338
02:23:34,690 --> 02:23:38,950
Keep the enemy under constant
pressure and off balance,

2339
02:23:38,951 --> 02:23:43,951
and be fully prepared to accomplish the
mission regardless of the conditions

2340
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:47,470
under which the war begins.

2341
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:55,140
And of course you do all those
things by stepping out into the fray

2342
02:23:58,090 --> 02:24:01,870
and getting after it.
And until next time,

2343
02:24:02,830 --> 02:24:04,840
this is echo and Jocko.
