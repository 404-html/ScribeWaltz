1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:05,680
This is Jocko podcast number
59 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:10,280
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,600
Okay.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,670
Their screams are the worst.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,700
We're more than a hundred meters
away on the other side of the river,

6
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,340
but I can hear marines dying.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,730
Their armored vehicle hit a landmine.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:33,450
Yeah,

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,170
it caught fire with 15 men aboard.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,053
Okay.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,630
They scream as they burn alive.

12
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:49,600
The radio chatter is desperate.
Almost a sterically.

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,533
Okay.

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,980
Nobody can get to them.

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,090
There will be no salvation,

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,650
only a torturous death in the flames

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,750
from our position across the river,

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,740
we hear every agonizing moment and can
see their funeral pyre rising over the

19
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,474
river bank.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,730
I can do nothing.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,340
Okay.

22
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,340
It is the most helpless enraging
feeling I've ever experienced.

23
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,740
I have no way to get across
the water to those burning men.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,960
Okay.

25
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,650
It takes forever for the
last screams to fade away.

26
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,713
Yeah.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,020
And that is an excerpt from a
book called Heart for the fight.

28
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,650
Okay.

29
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,170
And it's written by a
guy named Brian Stan,

30
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,080
and if you don't know who Brian Stann is,

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,170
you can Google him.

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,320
Okay.

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,050
He's a son,
a father or husband.

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,060
He was the WEC light heavyweight
champion of the world.

35
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
He's a UFC veteran.

36
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,580
Yeah.

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,580
11 fights in the UFC with some wins and
some losses against some of the best

38
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,124
fighters in the world.

39
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,480
He's also a veteran of the
United States Marine Corps

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,070
with two tours to Iraq as a platoon
commander and as a company XL.

41
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,070
And I am honored tonight to actually
have Brian with us here as a guest.

42
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,100
Yeah,

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,600
Mr Brian Stann welcome to the
show. I got to tell you, that's a,

44
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,730
I have not been introduced
like that before at an exit
of that book that I could

45
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,450
honestly say I haven't laid eyes on,
I don't even know how many years.

46
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,720
I forget the year we released
it. Some powerful writing by, uh,

47
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,090
my ghost writer Jon Bruning. And
that is a tough, tough memory.

48
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,330
It's one of those ones that we kind of
buried deep down and think about just

49
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,720
from time to time. But, uh,
certainly when you, when you,

50
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,120
at times where maybe you take
things for granted in life,

51
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,440
it's good to go back to that moment.
You know, and realize that a,

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,070
whenever I may be whining
about or whatever I think
is difficult at the time is

53
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,840
a heck of a lot easier than it once was.
And I need to be grateful,

54
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,890
get off my butt and go
finish. Yeah. I think that

55
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,860
a lot of people, you know, you get,

56
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,860
you see the explosions take
place with ideas and you know,

57
00:03:57,861 --> 00:04:00,400
the wars that we were involved
in were, you know, the,

58
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,200
the main weapon of the enemy was the IED.

59
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,810
And even when we made thicker,

60
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,430
heavier armored vehicles or like track
vehicles when they get hit with an IED,

61
00:04:10,431 --> 00:04:13,730
even though it might withstand some of
the impact, there's fires start and it's,

62
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:18,350
it's a nightmare. And this is the
nightmare you describe right there. And

63
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,090
okay.

64
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:21,100
You know,
I want to get into that.

65
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:24,310
I want to get into the
combat that you experienced.

66
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,300
But before we do that, first of all,
like the people that listen to this show,

67
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,520
not everyone even watches UFC,
not everyone knows about you.

68
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,840
So just kind of give a
little bit of a background

69
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,200
on grown up. Let's take it back to
Scranton. Chevy. Yeah, absolutely.

70
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,900
Uh,
so moved around a lot.

71
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:50,500
I was actually sells born in Japan and uh,
around that time when,

72
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,560
when my mom had come back to the states,

73
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,920
my father had left and so grew
up in northeast Pennsylvania.

74
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,080
We moved around quite a bit,
uh,

75
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,290
but got into sports in the early age.

76
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,990
And I had a phenomenal mom and,

77
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:08,991
and I think not having a dad really
affected my sister a lot more than it

78
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:11,190
affected me.
Um,

79
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,180
but even from an early age,
I,

80
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,160
I knew that the military was going to
be an option from the days of being a

81
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:23,290
young kid watching silly movies like
Iron Eagle, you know, they were,

82
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,150
they were something, they were not called
Iron Eagle. Silly in front of that.

83
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:32,700
That's not your classic.
Yep. But, but for me there,

84
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,930
there was always something to it that,
that rang is special to me.

85
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,770
And you know,
what I found is growing up without a dad,

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,060
you tend to want to impress every
male influence you have in your life.

87
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,890
So every time I went out for a team,

88
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,110
I wanted to be the hardest
worker on the team.

89
00:05:49,111 --> 00:05:52,370
I'd run through a wall for my coach and,
and,

90
00:05:52,371 --> 00:05:54,690
and that continued all the
way through high school.

91
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:56,490
And then all of a sudden
playing high school football,

92
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,760
I started to get recruited by some good
schools and not many people in my family

93
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,541
had gone to college.

94
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,680
Certainly I had expected to go to college
but never expected to get recruited to

95
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:09,620
go play somewhere. And so that
was a different experience for me.

96
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,260
I didn't always handle it the best.
Um,

97
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,430
but when the naval academy came knocking,
you know,

98
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,230
I knew that's what I wanted to go.

99
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,610
West Point started recruiting me
early as a junior, I took my films,

100
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,260
my tapes to the Naval Academy.

101
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,340
There was just something about that
place and I wanted to go there.

102
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,210
So I decided before I make a decision,
let me visit West Point,

103
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,520
let me visit the Naval Academy
and a four day time period,

104
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,880
I'll visit both and make my decision.
When I went to West Point,

105
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,510
one of the football coaches was
supposed to meet me there never showed.

106
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,360
So one of the players took me
around campus, showed me some stuff,

107
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:47,380
but it was still beautiful. I
mean greater than any, you know,

108
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,110
Scranton's one of the poorest
cities in America. It's not nice.

109
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,830
So you know, my uncles,
my aunts and my mom,

110
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,780
the thought of me going to
the naval came as a big deal.

111
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,300
I remember my track coach in high
school telling me, Brian, listen,

112
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,580
this is a big deal.
It's a great opportunity.

113
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:05,420
There's a lot of things in your life that
can change by going here. I said, yeah,

114
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,490
but you know, I'm getting recruited by
some of these Ivy League schools to,

115
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:11,420
he says, Eh, it's not the same and I don't
think you're going to fit in. I honest,

116
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm going to be honest with you,
Brian, my track coach, so bright guy.

117
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,600
So two days later I go to the naval
academy and a hand them my tape. Now.

118
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:19,010
They hadn't even started
recruiting me yet,

119
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,250
but those coaches were so nice to my
mom. And by doing that, it was mom,

120
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,030
they recruited my mom. They were so
respectful to her. The water was there.

121
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,880
It was so pretty. Okay.
You know, I'm, I'm in.

122
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,150
And I had made that decision early
that that's where I wanted to go and,

123
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:38,260
and focused on and that,
you know,

124
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:42,800
did some summer school to take some
classes to boost my AP courses in high

125
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,780
school just to make sure they don't
have to go to the prep school first.

126
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,130
I want to go right to the naval
academy. And so that, that in,

127
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:51,440
in a really quick nutshell,
football was a vehicle. Um,

128
00:07:51,441 --> 00:07:54,980
along with my academics were good,
but you know, having a three,

129
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,750
five GPA and a 12,
10,

130
00:07:56,751 --> 00:07:59,570
and your sats isn't normally going
to get you into the naval academy.

131
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,480
Football was,
was the vehicle that got me there.

132
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:06,860
And I could remember prom night lifting
weights in the weight room with my

133
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,610
rented Tux in the locker. I was there
all by myself. I had the security code,

134
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,420
I was, I, you know, one of the only
guys who worked all summer long.

135
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:18,260
I was the only white guy where I worked
in this tomato plant and I would work to

136
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,930
help pay for the high school I went to.
Cause my mom,

137
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,530
my mom took me out of public schooling,

138
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:25,010
put me in this good high school because
I got suspended a couple of times in

139
00:08:25,011 --> 00:08:27,950
middle school and it was one of the
harder decisions but one of the best

140
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,620
decisions that she made
and pushed me towards,

141
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,910
cause the teachers at that school when
they saw me having this opportunity,

142
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:37,640
they helped, hey, let's help
Brian get to the Naval Academy,

143
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:42,050
go there to play football. But you know,
really get himself on a great trajectory.

144
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,200
And uh, there, there's
not a day I regret it.

145
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,560
There were definitely days I couldn't
stand being at the Naval Academy like

146
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:52,430
anybody hated it.
But the friends I made there,

147
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,250
the opportunities and the pathway to
the Marine Corps, still to this day,

148
00:08:56,251 --> 00:09:01,170
I don't know if I'll ever be as good at
any job because I wasn't being a marine

149
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,370
infantry officer. I just,
I don't know that. And we,

150
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,490
when you got there you're,
they,

151
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:12,000
the type of football that they were
playing didn't really match your cause you

152
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:16,140
were a quarterback and I was right. And
so in the book you're saying that your,

153
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,650
your type of football didn't really
match what they wanted to do? No,

154
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,230
it was a rude awakening for me. You
know, I went there thinking, Hey,

155
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm going to be the next Roger Staubach
and we all did and then all of a sudden

156
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,350
you start to see all these other
kids from all over the country. Wow.

157
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,840
They're good too.
I'd never really run the option before.

158
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,900
And they've got guys from the prep school
that already done a year in the system

159
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,780
and did that system in high
school that can run the option.

160
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,190
So next thing you know,

161
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:40,230
I'm getting moved to wider
Seaver and get moved to safety.

162
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:40,860
Then I'm getting moved,

163
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,290
a linebacker and I have to figure
out how to play these positions.

164
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,320
And it was one of the best lessons I ever
learned as a young man where I had to

165
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,270
make a decision,
I'm going to contribute to this team.

166
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,660
I'm not going to be a starter,
I'm not going to be a star.

167
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,190
Some of the best contributions I can
make as a leader are to help mentally

168
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:03,600
prepare the younger guys to play.
So my senior year,

169
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,020
I was competing for the starting outside
linebacker position and we had this

170
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:11,670
young kid named Bobby Mclaren who
was an animal, I mean an animal,

171
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,550
but he was uncontrollable. He could
not understand the defense at all.

172
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:18,030
He's still wild man, flying around,
knocking over anything he touched,

173
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,750
but he was an idiot if football was an
engineering major, really bright kid,

174
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,050
but a more on in football.
All right, so I'm a senior,

175
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:28,230
I'm going to help this kid out and
we're in two and I'm competing for the

176
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:31,770
starting job and I'm helping this kid
out who's third string and he's getting

177
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:35,100
frustrated and then all of a sudden he
starts to get it and he's starting to

178
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,934
grasp on.

179
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,840
And slowly but surely I could see this
kid taken not only my job but the job of

180
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:43,410
the guy who was ahead of me, who I
was competing with. And you know,

181
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,390
the bottom line was is I had to find
a way to contribute value to the team,

182
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:49,950
obviously has a special teams contributor,

183
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,530
but leadership was going to be the
biggest thing I contributed and,

184
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:57,780
and that made me a very valuable
member of the team that season.

185
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,950
And it taught me great lessons moving
forward both in the marine corps and

186
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:03,420
especially now in my job.

187
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:07,320
If you aren't finding a way to
add value to your organization,

188
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:11,010
to your team every day
and you're wasting time,

189
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:14,610
you're wasting money and
somebody's going to take that spot,

190
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,660
somebody will come along and take that
spot. I don't care how successful you get,

191
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,950
you can't take life for granted everyday.
You got to add value.

192
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,280
I learned that lesson
early in my football coach.

193
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,960
My linebacker coach liked me the most.

194
00:11:27,961 --> 00:11:30,840
I was his favorite guy and he would admit
that to me in our personal meetings.

195
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,260
But the end of the day he
told me, Brian, I get paid.

196
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:38,910
I feed my family to put the best players
on the field who are gonna help us win

197
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:42,600
games. I really wished that was
you right now. But it's not.

198
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,810
And those are hard
conversations to listen to.

199
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,310
But if you're going to be a leader,

200
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,750
you gotta be able to receive that
information and find a way to get better.

201
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,980
Yeah. You know, speaking of that, so

202
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,940
you, you actually, they fired the coach
that you had your first three years.

203
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:01,390
New Coach came in and I'm going to go
to the book here. It's your senior year.

204
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,980
Two a days are brutal or deals detested
by every player who has stepped foot on

205
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,650
a, on a football field. That summer,

206
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,500
our new coach, Paul Johnson used
to a days to make a statement.

207
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,950
He made us proud and start
practicing before dawn.

208
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:22,951
Every day at zero four 45 we reported
to the field and Johnson's new coaching

209
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:26,980
staff beat us half to death with
repeated fourth quarter drills we ran.

210
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,830
We hit none of this.
No contact drilling.

211
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,270
Johnson spared no one by mid morning.
Guys were puking where they stood.

212
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,190
I love this right here.

213
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,370
No wonder why you pussies went oh and 11
he shouted more than once as we gasped

214
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:46,060
and suffered. Coach Johnson showed
no mercy when he evaluated the team,

215
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:49,300
he concluded that we lacked
discipline and motivation.

216
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,670
He made our two weeks in August,

217
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,360
a crucible designed to test our
toughness and our commitment to the team.

218
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,990
At one point, a wide receiver
went down with a phantom injury.

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,880
After the team doctor examined the
whiteout and found nothing wrong with him.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,180
Coach Johnson demoted him on this bought.

221
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,020
So coach Johnson came in
and dropped the he have it.

222
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,950
I still remember, you know,
back then at the naval can,

223
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,780
we had what was called instant messenger.

224
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,440
And so you could leave in a way message,
you know, and your instant messenger.

225
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:22,540
And we did our fourth quarter drilled.
I remember our starting defensive end,

226
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:25,770
Pete Butte Miller, he left
in his away message. He said,

227
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,490
today I met death and death kicked my,
you know what?

228
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,870
It was brutal and they scream that
at us repeatedly. No wonder you went,

229
00:13:33,871 --> 00:13:38,220
Oh and 11 we were in Naval
Academy football team and
the previous coach had let

230
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:42,570
discipline just run awry. You know,
both on the field in practice,

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,290
in the weight room, in films you could be
hurt all week, still start in the game.

232
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,960
The things that are essential for a
military academy team to win. I mean you,

233
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:54,000
you've gotta be in better shape than
the other team and you've got to commit

234
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,030
less mental errors because physically
you're never really going to match up.

235
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,890
Right? And we were making that
error and from all that chaos,

236
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,500
one of the,

237
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,500
the real amazing things I learned from
those coaches who that staff is basically

238
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:09,991
still there today.

239
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:13,650
Coach Niumatalolo was the offensive
coordinator when Johnson left.

240
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,220
He's now the head coach,
but they taught me as,

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,000
as leaders to expect excellent.
Every single drill,

242
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,580
every film session,
every weight room session,

243
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,950
every conditioning there was a standard.

244
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,220
You either meet the standard
or you don't meet the standard.

245
00:14:29,221 --> 00:14:32,550
And if you don't meet the standard, there
are consequences. There's remediation.

246
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,450
There's ways that you have to fix it
because this is the only thing that's good

247
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:38,750
enough. If we're going to move
forward, you either get better,

248
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,400
you get worse every day. Getting
worse is unacceptable. And when,

249
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:47,401
when you take that mentality as an officer
to what you're doing in the field to

250
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:50,430
train 160 marines to go to combat,

251
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,750
all of a sudden that gets a lot more
serious than win and lose and football

252
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:58,100
games. But that, that, that holds true
in business. It holds true in anything.

253
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,990
There is a standard. And if you, if you
accept below that standard, just once,

254
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,090
that sets a precedent that could lead to
what happened before he got there. And,

255
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:08,481
and I've,

256
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,600
I've gone back to the Naval Academy
repeatedly and I've talked to the team.

257
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:14,000
I actually talked to the
junior class every single year.

258
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,560
And one of the things I always
tell those coaches, uh, gentlemen,

259
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:23,770
you guys are putting out a better
product as officers because you're here.

260
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:26,600
Your job is to put forth
the great football team.

261
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:29,660
But I promise you and the staff at
the Naval Academy, the officers,

262
00:15:29,661 --> 00:15:30,494
they see it too.

263
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,160
They are making better leaders because
of what they're doing on the football

264
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:36,410
field before they got there,
that wasn't happening.

265
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,160
What was happening on the football field
is making, making us worse officers.

266
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,490
And so I, I still hold true, he
now coaches John Paul Johnson,

267
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:44,600
coaches at Georgia tech now,

268
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,260
he brought me down to speak to the team
a couple of years ago and we had some

269
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:50,150
great conversations,
but I mean he's still,

270
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,170
he's still that same guy still
thinks he can beat me up. Coach,

271
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,870
I get it. And I'm not asking you in
front of your teammates, you always say,

272
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:04,130
you can walk me. You have to realize now
there's not a chance, but he is not. Boy,

273
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,470
I'm telling you, I still think I
won't be and he'll throw this off.

274
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,470
You know right across.
It's geriatric at this point.

275
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,580
He could barely even get his arm up,

276
00:16:10,581 --> 00:16:14,090
but he's still throws it like he can beat
me. He's game, he's gay, he's gained,

277
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,950
he's game. The heart's
there. The body though.

278
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,260
So you actually, you actually talk
about this in the book. So here we go.

279
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:26,220
All that effort, pain and misery made
me a more disciplined human being.

280
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,840
It prepared me for the trials ahead.
As a Marine infantry officer.

281
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,770
In fact,

282
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,400
many of the lessons I learned helped me
better prepare my platoon and later my

283
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:39,960
company for combat in Iraq,
in football and in a rifle company,

284
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,160
there is no substitute for discipline,
hard work and commitment.

285
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,720
If any of these elements are lacking,
the team is going to lose.

286
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,090
The company will get shot to
pieces and combat and men will die.

287
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I learned there is no margin for error
in both and the only way to be perfect is

288
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:04,860
to demand perfection and
never Brooke excuses.

289
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,803
There you go.

290
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,590
That's life. I mean, you know at
that point especially then that is,

291
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,800
that is your world. That
is your life, the military.

292
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:18,801
So unique in that other jobs you can
leave at 5:00 PM 6:00 PM whenever you go

293
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:24,090
home from work. Hey, I am no longer
an accountant. Now I'm Jimmy, now,

294
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm Sarah, now I'm, I'm whomever.
Right? But in the military,

295
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:31,170
if you're bad at your job,
you're a bad person.

296
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,150
And that's kind of how you're looking
at know if, you know, it's, it's true.

297
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,030
If you, if you're an infantry officer
and you're not good if you're in,

298
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:43,500
if this isn't everything you eat, sleep
and breathe your week. I mean that's just,

299
00:17:43,501 --> 00:17:46,310
that's just the kind of
environment we have. And,

300
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,650
and I always tell the story when
people look at me like crazy.

301
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,360
I tell him this story had a marine
named James Brown, no affiliation with,

302
00:17:55,361 --> 00:18:00,300
with the famous person. And, and James is
a great marine. He was a tough, tough kid.

303
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,070
And he was in a machine gun posts,
uh,

304
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,560
watching over a main avenue of approach.

305
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,560
And his job was to make sure that it
stayed clear. He had the best topics,

306
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,350
keep it clear of ids,
make sure nobody plants an IED there.

307
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,980
And everything was bulletproof around
him except for the one slit where the two

308
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:21,981
40 golf went through and
it was hot 125 degrees.

309
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,290
And, and people always ask me,
why are the Marines so extreme?

310
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:28,860
When you make statements like that,
discipline, commitment there, everything,

311
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,700
everything has to be perfect. I
tell them the story. It got hot.

312
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,350
James leaned against the rifle to get a
little breeze through that slip and that

313
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,180
moment got shot in the
head by a sniper and died.

314
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
It was an amazing shot when we
went up there and looked at where,

315
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:47,310
I mean in Iraq they had some very,
very good snipers as we know,

316
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,580
right?
But not one split moment.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,800
I lost that marine and everything.
We do everything you do to perfection.

318
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,830
That's why you demand
perfection in everything you
do because you are so afraid

319
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,080
that they're not going to come home alive.

320
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,700
And I had to tell my
marines just one time,

321
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:07,860
they were lacking in some of
their standards. This is in Iraq.

322
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,030
I made them stand uniform inspections.
Imagine their attitude is,

323
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:15,450
I made them stand three uniform
inspection today and they were so mad.

324
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,141
But in leadership,

325
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,350
you can't do something like that without
telling them to why they're not going

326
00:19:19,351 --> 00:19:22,290
to buy it. They're just going to hate you
now. And I told him, I said, listen guys,

327
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,040
we're not stranded.

328
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,160
We're not strapping down our
ammo and the Humvees well enough.

329
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,050
We're not cleaning our
weapons right after mission.

330
00:19:28,051 --> 00:19:29,850
Like we should be not
wearing our uniforms.

331
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,100
We get back to camp because you think
you're so cool cause you've been in a

332
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:35,010
bunch of firefights.
If we don't do the little things right,

333
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,570
it's going to affect the big things.

334
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:39,300
And ultimately what's going to
happen is we are going to die,

335
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:42,420
we're going to lose or the people
we're here to protect are going to die.

336
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,890
Therefore I'm going to do these uniform
inspections until all of these things

337
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:51,891
are fixed permanently and I am totally
fine with you hating me right now.

338
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,630
If that means I will deliver you home
alive with the mission accomplished,

339
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,910
I'd rather you be alive and hate me.

340
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,950
Then you guys love me cause you think
I'm super cool but then have you guys die

341
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,360
because of my poor leadership and my
inability to keep you guys discipline and

342
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,500
keep you to the standard of perfection
and, and that is something, it's hard for.

343
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,890
People haven't been in that circumstance.
It's hard for them to understand.

344
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,200
It really is. But even in my
current job running a nonprofit, I,

345
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,020
I tell my staff, every single veteran
they speak to every conversation,

346
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,780
whether it's the 10 times you talked
to that vet and you're doing another

347
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:28,650
practice interview,

348
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,120
our job is to help them
find the American dream,

349
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,440
to leave the military by their own
choosing and now find not a job,

350
00:20:37,441 --> 00:20:39,600
but a great career where they can thrive.

351
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:42,630
And if we take any conversation
with them for granted,

352
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,080
they may no longer want to take our
advice. They may go at it alone,

353
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:49,540
they may not the right
thing and we failed them.

354
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,660
People give us money not to fail them.

355
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:56,230
Your paid with other people's money
that they gave us to help these vets get

356
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:59,770
jobs. Period. If we're not doing that,

357
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:03,040
then you don't work here anymore.
I don't work here anymore, period.

358
00:21:03,041 --> 00:21:05,500
We will find somebody else to
do it because that's our job.

359
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,720
And so you've got to set that standard.

360
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
But if you don't tell them the why
behind it, they'll never understand that.

361
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,030
And it doesn't mean that we have this,

362
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,170
this culture is not like my platoon
had this culture where we were all so

363
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:20,200
hardcore and there was no compassion,
there was no personality.

364
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,000
There's no smiles as
you can attest to look,

365
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,980
you can have an environment of discipline,
hard work and commitment,

366
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,230
but still have a lot of love,
compassion in good times.

367
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,660
You had fun, a lot of
straight up. You know,

368
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,440
it's great fun when you go and
you train and you're awesome.

369
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,070
You don't have a lot of fun.
The New England patriots,

370
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,330
they have a hell of a lot of fun and you
went to a discipline and commitment and

371
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:47,164
hard work.

372
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,690
That's why they're on the top and they
have a lot of fun smile at the end of

373
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,390
every season. Everybody hates on them
and they're raising the trophies. So

374
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,610
you got this section in the book that
talks about what you're talking about

375
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:03,600
right now, the leadership factory, right?
So here I'm going to go to the book.

376
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,170
All the academic classes in the world
will never teach anyone to be a leader.

377
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,760
The academy recognized that long ago
and while we had to take courses on the

378
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:16,620
subject, we learned by doing the academy
is structured to provide leadership

379
00:22:16,621 --> 00:22:20,610
opportunities in a wide variety of places
and levels from the very first day you

380
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:22,140
start as plebes,

381
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:29,300
and this is emphasizing what you just
said and discipline is something that I

382
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:36,420
talk about all the time and,

383
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,470
and you know,
it's great as you know,

384
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:41,130
as I was talking to you on the way over
here, you know, I do, I do all of these,

385
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,290
I read these leadership
or not leadership books,

386
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,840
they're not books about leadership.
There are about combat, right?

387
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,260
But combat is about leadership.
So all these books, all of them,

388
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,490
every single one of them,

389
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:55,700
whether it's an ancient Roman military
leader or a marine in Vietnam or an army

390
00:22:57,721 --> 00:23:02,220
soldier in World War II, they all, there
is one common thing that's disciplined,

391
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:06,060
disciplined, discipline. It's
always there. Back to the book,

392
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:11,090
discipline forms the cornerstone of any
military team and of course punishment

393
00:23:11,161 --> 00:23:14,850
serves as one of the means
to maintain discipline.

394
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,130
During my junior year, I learned not
to be afraid to mete out punishment.

395
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,680
At the same time.

396
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,360
Doing so requires a balance of
appropriateness and understanding,

397
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,700
so that's the why you just
talked about right there,

398
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,780
and this again goes to something
that I talk about a lot, which is,

399
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,530
which is the dichotomy of leadership,
which is in leadership. There's,

400
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,770
there's opposing forces that are pulling
you into different directions and both

401
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:42,810
of them are right.
They're both right.

402
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,010
It's right to be hard on your guys and
maintain discipline and it's right to

403
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:47,120
love you guys and take care of her.

404
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,630
You have to balance those two and that's
what you're talking about right there.

405
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,680
That's what you were
talking about when you were,

406
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,120
when you were talking about they need to
understand why they're being punishment,

407
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,320
punished back to the book.

408
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,220
Bad officers try to be
buddies with their marines.

409
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,450
There's a fine line between getting to
know you're getting to know the men under

410
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:08,330
your command and bonding
with them as friends.

411
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,580
It is all too easy to make that mistake
at the same time. Here's the balance.

412
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:14,810
At the same time,

413
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,380
if a young second lieutenant doesn't
make an effort to know his men,

414
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,940
his aloofness becomes a drag and will
hinder his ability to command in several

415
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:26,270
ways. First, you won't understand the
strengths and weaknesses of his squads.

416
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,410
More important,

417
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,450
he won't have the respect or the
connection needed to motivate and lead.

418
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,890
In the worst of circumstances,

419
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,170
men will follow other men into the worst
possible circumstances if they respect

420
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:43,640
and believe in their leadership
like all other aspects of command.

421
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,590
It is a delicate balance.

422
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:46,920
Okay,

423
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,120
so you're, you're just everything you
just said. You say it in the book and

424
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:52,990
okay,

425
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,690
that's why you're talking about the
leadership factory, but it's interesting.

426
00:24:55,691 --> 00:24:58,720
This is stuff that I'm sure they
touched on it in the classes,

427
00:24:58,721 --> 00:25:01,570
but that's the stuff that you learn.
You learn it from senior enlisted people,

428
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:03,760
you learn it from other officers,
you learn it yourself,

429
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,820
you work for people and you
go, man, this guy's aloof.

430
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,650
This guy's not talking to us. So it's
stuff that we learned ourselves too.

431
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,260
I'm going to finish this section up.

432
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:15,670
I concluded the proper
balance here depended on the
officer's ability to listen

433
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:19,600
and accept input while still making it
clear that he was the ultimate decision

434
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,550
maker.
That was the key.

435
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,350
A second lieutenant couldn't be afraid
to engage in frank and productive

436
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,450
dialogue with his key leaders.

437
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,960
A platoon becomes the reflection of
its commander. He sets the example,

438
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,430
and this is from what you just said,
if his uniform is jacked up,

439
00:25:41,431 --> 00:25:42,660
his men won't care about their own.

440
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,440
This leads to disciplinary issues
and becomes a very slippery slope.

441
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,270
The only way a second lieutenant can
have the moral authority to set a high

442
00:25:51,271 --> 00:25:56,271
standard is to set a high standard for
conditioning and appearance is to Stevie

443
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:57,960
example himself.

444
00:25:59,250 --> 00:25:59,950
Okay.

445
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,010
Without conditioning, opportune cannot
achieve its potential in the field.

446
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,470
Aggressiveness suffers.

447
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:06,910
Okay.

448
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,910
Appearance breeds pride and reinforces
discipline and a spree decor.

449
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,060
So those,

450
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,110
that's the leadership factory that you're
talking about and clearly those things

451
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,940
that you brought from the football
field and from the academy,

452
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,160
you apply them right directly into
your folks in combat. They helped and,

453
00:26:24,161 --> 00:26:28,260
and you know the Marine Corps has a
really unique circumstance where they have

454
00:26:28,261 --> 00:26:29,160
the basic score.

455
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,190
Every single officer goes there and
that's huge to set this huge standard.

456
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,490
Then we go a step further where when
we go to infantry officer course,

457
00:26:38,491 --> 00:26:43,020
that course was 13 weeks long. One of
the very hardest, if not the hardest,

458
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,973
the Marine Corps,

459
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,470
mentally, physically, everything. You
don't know anything that's coming,

460
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,630
everything's a surprise.

461
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,700
But I felt that my instructors during
our course were phenomenal and they were

462
00:26:53,701 --> 00:26:56,460
getting all the real time
intelligence from the battlefield.

463
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,350
All the training was realistic.

464
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,620
But in terms of how you relate to your
marines from your junior enlisted to

465
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,200
your, your middle rank,
to your senior enlisted,

466
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,730
how you relate to the senior enlisted
from the battalion who worked directly for

467
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:12,810
the battalion staff.

468
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,640
How you manage those
relationships to maximize the
effectiveness of your platoon,

469
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:20,130
to make sure that you can
get exactly what they need.

470
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,790
They did such a good job of that.
Then you take it one step further.

471
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,650
When I reported third battalion,
Second Marines,

472
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:29,190
I'd be remiss if I didn't give credit
to a guy by the name of Gabe Diana,

473
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,280
who is a lieutenant colonel in
the Marine Corps now I believe,

474
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,820
but he taught me he was a true student
of leadership and military history.

475
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:40,890
He would tell me all the time,
his craft is his hobby.

476
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:45,120
There's nothing else he cared about. It's
what he was. He loved being a marine,

477
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:46,200
love being an officer,

478
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,340
and he taught me a lot about
decentralized leadership,

479
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,950
how to not micromanage,
how to empower your junior leaders,

480
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:58,740
that they start to think like you and you
could achieve tempo on the battlefield

481
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,780
and you could immediately see
examples of marines. I call it,

482
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,740
and I see it all the time in the
business world. I call it JV leadership,

483
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,220
where I'm a great leader if my people
love me and they're the same leaders that

484
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:16,290
will tell their people,
our it guys today,

485
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:20,250
we've got to stay 30 minutes longer
because headquarters said so, look,

486
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:23,430
I disagree with it. I think it's
ridiculous, but we have to do it,

487
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:24,870
so let's just sit here together.

488
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,600
Now none of their people are
actually going to work motivated.

489
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,560
There'd be no discipline.

490
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:31,590
There's going to be no standard that
they're trying to achieve because of that

491
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:35,750
horrible leadership JV or angry at
headquarters. Absolute, they're there.

492
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:39,900
They're Batman at the chain of command.
Exactly as JV leadership,

493
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:43,890
and I'm constantly trying to talk to
people about that. A JV leadership.

494
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,950
The first thing of it is you think you
have to be loved to be an effective

495
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:51,300
leader. If you are an effective leader
over the long term, you will be loved.

496
00:28:51,301 --> 00:28:53,640
But there's going to be intermittent
parked where they can't stand you.

497
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,220
They don't understand things all the
time or they're gonna be mad at you and

498
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:56,530
their cause it.

499
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:00,030
Cause there are emotional but over long
term they're gonna understand that what

500
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:04,800
you did was best. The other, the second
major part to JV leadership is thinking,

501
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:06,210
Hey,
I'm in charge,

502
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:09,810
therefore I come up with all the great
ideas and I'm going to make every single

503
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,430
decision without your input and I'm gonna,

504
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,970
I'm gonna really try hard to make
sure that he knows I am in charge.

505
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,990
That's ridiculous. It is not your job
to come up with all the great ideas.

506
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:22,740
Some of the best ideas I
received were from 19 year olds,

507
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,600
21 year olds who had already been direct
ones, had a grace or I got a great idea.

508
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,230
Well, I want to hear all about it's, it's,

509
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:35,010
it's our job as leaders to decide which
are the best ideas to invest energy,

510
00:29:35,011 --> 00:29:39,060
time, and resources in. And that's not
just, I get all this stuff all the time.

511
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:41,740
When I talked to different
groups and companies, well,

512
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,980
military leadership is different
than corporate leadership. Why?

513
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,990
What am I saying here that does doesn't
apply. Well, it, it's too extreme.

514
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,430
It is not, you're taking us
too literal with, with, with,

515
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:57,700
with our warrior mentalities
here, you know, the,

516
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,360
that you do not need to be an insecure.
The best leaders are not insecure.

517
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,991
They're secure.

518
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,500
They know that they're there and
ultimately gonna make the final decision.

519
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,280
But it empowers your people and
you could achieve tempo when you're

520
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:13,090
decentralized enough that they feel
good about coming up with ideas,

521
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,160
sending them up to you to get back up
for it and get resources behind it.

522
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,850
But also knowing that they can make the
appropriate decisions at their level

523
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,600
because they know what your final intent
is. Here's the outcome I want achieved.

524
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:29,170
You get us there. You're the expert
at it. That's why I hire Jim.

525
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,950
I didn't tell my machine gunners how
to work their t and e system and how to

526
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:34,450
cite in their machine guns.
Right.

527
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:36,850
I just told him what I wanted them
to hit their better than that.

528
00:30:36,851 --> 00:30:41,560
It me taking the time to spend it with
my marines in their different functions

529
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:43,960
and aspects and talk to
them about how they're,

530
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:47,770
they're the expert and compliment them
like that. It made them feel great.

531
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,820
It does wonders for a
leader to go to their level,

532
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:56,821
see what they do every day and see that
expert work cause they don't expect you

533
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,940
to be an expert in all of that. They
know that, right. Your job is different,

534
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:04,360
your responsibilities are different. You,
you need to have greater perspective.

535
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:06,670
But when you go to their level in respect,

536
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,760
what they do and show them respect
for what they do and how they do it,

537
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,830
man,
it's a powerful thing that that could,

538
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:19,300
that could make a group of people so
much better collectively than they ever

539
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:22,480
would have been individually. And when
it happens, right, when it finally,

540
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:26,080
when you finally get there and can
achieve that, it is, it is awesome.

541
00:31:26,081 --> 00:31:29,350
It's the most rewarding
experience you could ever have.

542
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,170
And it's hard for people to, to understand
because most people, they, well,

543
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:35,140
the most rewarding experience you guys
probably have is killing people. No,

544
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,800
it's so much different than that.
So much different.

545
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:41,730
There's so much more to
it than that. Yeah. Yeah.

546
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,860
It's interesting too that by the way,

547
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,540
what you're saying right now is basically
the entire book that my buddy Leif

548
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:50,570
Babin,
this is the mood.

549
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,920
There's a chapter in there
called decentralized command
with everything you're

550
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:57,580
saying. So, but, and that's why you know,
you've come up in a completely different,

551
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:02,020
you know, in the Marine Corps.
I was in the, in the, in
the navy and yet, you know,

552
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,040
you and I have both.

553
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:06,970
I can tell right now basically
completely aligned leadership principles.

554
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Isn't it interesting though that some
guys don't get it if he don't get it and

555
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:16,720
you could explain it to them
and you'd say, listen man, hey,

556
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,750
you don't need to make every decision.
And in fact,

557
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,660
when you get out in a firefight,
you won't be able to make every decision.

558
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,270
You're going to have to let your leaders
lead and you're going to let have to

559
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:26,104
let and the,

560
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,990
and they would listen to you and you could
see it going right through their head.

561
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,490
It's wild.

562
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:34,600
You wonder what psycho psychological he
is going on in there that makes you want

563
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,300
to rebel. And a lot of times it's, hey,

564
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:41,810
they got a bad review from officer said,
this is their way of saying, you know,

565
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:45,860
hey, uh, you know, go fly a kite. You
know this, this is their way of rebelling.

566
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:50,150
I noticed that with some officers. Um,
and in some of the, you know, I had,

567
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:54,560
I had a fire lieutenant during my second
deployment and, and he had this problem,

568
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,110
you know, he kept feeling he had to
be best friends with his marines.

569
00:32:57,111 --> 00:33:00,230
He spent way too much time with them
talking about a lot of personal stuff.

570
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,510
They'd be out on patrol and
nobody would listen to them.

571
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,160
I mean it was almost straight Muni.

572
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:08,720
And then when I had to fire him and here
was the thing is, and tell them, look,

573
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:14,140
you're a really good person and you are
most likely going to be very successful

574
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:18,500
in whatever you choose to do.
So please, please remember that.

575
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,530
It's hard to hear that now this is a
very unique job and we are in a very

576
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:27,650
dangerous dinner and we were already in
Iraq and we were in a dangerous area at

577
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:32,360
the time and things were about to go
south and I had to remove this kid now

578
00:33:32,361 --> 00:33:33,890
before things got worse.

579
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,450
And it was hard for him to understand
that you can be a phenomenal human being,

580
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,690
a great person,
but just not meant to lead,

581
00:33:41,691 --> 00:33:46,120
especially in in those circumstances.
But it's,

582
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,040
it's some people,
and I think it obviously,

583
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:54,041
if they have so many years growing up
in a household where it was so different

584
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:55,700
from what they're being taught,

585
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,450
that I think sometimes is the route for
them to push back against this type of

586
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,660
leadership. No. You know, I've been
taught differently for years and years.

587
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:05,420
It's Kinda like, well how did you just
block it all out for the, you know,

588
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:09,950
year and a half you've been in school
before you got here with guys with all

589
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:14,450
this combat experience and not to mention
the hundreds of years of history of

590
00:34:14,451 --> 00:34:19,040
combat experience saying, look,
this is the best way to do it. Yes.

591
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,000
And saying, no, I'm going to
do a different thing. I mean,

592
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,260
the military is a business.
It is a business.

593
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:28,040
It's run like a business
and the leadership there,

594
00:34:28,041 --> 00:34:33,041
it's about maximizing the potential of
all the human beings that you have on

595
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:35,360
your team. And how do you do that? Yes,

596
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:39,830
it involves tactics and in what we do is
different, but the, the, the personal,

597
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:43,490
the small unit down to the large
unit leadership is all the same.

598
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,110
It's all the same.

599
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,650
And you go around and you
talk to different executives
who are having trouble.

600
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:49,920
Well, you know this, you know,

601
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,240
it's the millennials and what they
do and what they do in this do,

602
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,910
and we were talking about
in the right here, people,

603
00:34:55,911 --> 00:34:58,460
the experts always want to
blame some kind of process.

604
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,640
I think you're processing your
information flow is wrong.

605
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,970
And the way that you have your workflow
set up in the office space that's

606
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:08,300
causing this issue in
communication. No, it's not.

607
00:35:08,301 --> 00:35:12,740
You're saying that because you are afraid
to have the hard conversations with

608
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:17,160
the leaders who are failing, which by
the way, you're one of the leaders. Yes.

609
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,680
So when you're failing as a business
and you've got these issues, yeah,

610
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:22,100
it's breathe,

611
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,860
you're going to be one of the problems
and you might need help squaring that

612
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:27,250
away. And that's okay. That's
okay. I'll do you know what?

613
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:31,040
Another thing I noticed in business
world is a lot of people in the business

614
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:34,280
world, they have no leadership
training. So they've figured it out,

615
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:37,740
they've been lucky and successful and
they've gotten by with good and then they

616
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:39,780
get to a certain point where all of a
sudden they're going, wait a second,

617
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:41,460
I can't handle this anymore.
That you know,

618
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,970
if you grow from six people that you know
pretty well that you trust and all of

619
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:47,100
a sudden you've got a
staff of a hundred people.

620
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:49,830
If you don't start learning how to lead,

621
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,230
you're going to have significant
problems and it's going to blow up.

622
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,690
And that happens from a hundred
people to 300 people in it,

623
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:57,150
from 300 people to a thousand people.
It'll happen every time.

624
00:35:57,151 --> 00:36:00,990
And you've got to train those leaders
throughout the chain of command that all

625
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:05,970
have the same understanding
of the fundamental principles
of combat leadership,

626
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,250
which is leadership.
You have the thrill combat in there.

627
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:13,110
Cause that was my old job. It's funny
you bring it up. There's a great example.

628
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,020
Dan Quinn is the current head coach.
At the Atlanta Falcons.

629
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,880
He was a defense coordinator at Seattle,

630
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,960
hires the head coach in
Atlanta and through his,

631
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,320
he's a very good friend of Jake Lazar
who's obviously very involved in mixed

632
00:36:25,321 --> 00:36:28,110
martial arts and does a lot of the Fox
broadcast and I've worked with him and

633
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:31,290
gotten close with them and
so Jay introduced me to Dan.

634
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:35,820
Dan was looking to make the team tougher
in and here's a guy who has achieved

635
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:38,700
the highest level of leadership and
coaching, just like you talked about.

636
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,320
He was a great coordinator.

637
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:45,321
Now he's a head coach and he had the
humility to seek out experts from all,

638
00:36:45,511 --> 00:36:49,110
I mean he went to different sports,
talk to their head coaches,

639
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,490
he went to the military,

640
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:55,491
he went all over with humility to ask
and get advice and glean experience other

641
00:36:56,671 --> 00:37:00,450
people's time and leadership to include,
I couldn't believe it,

642
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:02,580
but here I am having
breakfast at demand here.

643
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,120
I'm in his office or I'm in there and,
and you know their little cafeteria.

644
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:08,690
There were just talking leadership
and he's talking about some of these

645
00:37:08,691 --> 00:37:11,160
individual guys and he's
actually listening to my opinion.

646
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:15,000
Wanted to hear what I went through,
my opinion on this guy or that guy is,

647
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,970
he brought me in to do some martial
arts drills to make the team tougher,

648
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,070
but I gained so much respect for that.

649
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,850
Here's a man who's achieved the
highest level. He knows he's in charge,

650
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:24,990
he's not out to prove anything.

651
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,760
His guys know he's in charge and when
they don't meet the standard there's a

652
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:30,630
consequence.

653
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,080
But at the same time he shows them the
same kind of humility as he seeks out

654
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:39,990
advice to get better every day because
he wants them. Hey Julio Jones,

655
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,480
I know you think you're the
best wide receiver in football,

656
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,990
but there's ways you can get better and
you need to be humble enough to find

657
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:49,610
them. And guess what? Julio goes
first in every drill. The dudes that,

658
00:37:49,611 --> 00:37:50,660
I mean he at that,

659
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,180
I've watched him work as hard as any human
being I've seen in the football field,

660
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,860
always looking to get better.

661
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:58,710
Matt Ryan the same and look at
the position of the teams and now,

662
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:02,910
but he has continually done that.
He turned to navy seals last summer,

663
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:06,900
brought seals and to work with his
team to work with him on leadership,

664
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,490
on accountability and all this combat
but leadership leaders and bring it into

665
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:16,290
that locker room and create this
cohesive unit that has had a tremendous

666
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:19,980
turnaround from the 2015
season to now 2016 yeah. Yeah.

667
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,750
Now to championship again
for you reciting my book,

668
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,690
which is what to do, cause we were in a
chapter there, it's called check your ego.

669
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,570
And you know,
my point is the number one,

670
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,200
the number one characteristic that
a leader has to have his humility.

671
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,250
And if you don't have that, all those
things that you just talked about,

672
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:37,960
you won't do any of them.
You won't ever get better.

673
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,120
You won't listen to anybody else.
You won't take any advice. You can't.

674
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,190
That's a horrible thing. Um, let me,

675
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,960
let me, let me get us back on track
to your life a little bit here.

676
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,090
Uh, why did you pick the Marine
Corps? Because I couldn't swim

677
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,720
in all honesty.
You know,

678
00:38:58,721 --> 00:39:03,210
I had thought for a while that I wanted
to be a team guy playing football and

679
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,340
trying to be a cla. It's
extremely competitive. You know,

680
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,460
the guys who went into the teams and
I mean physical specimens discipline,

681
00:39:12,611 --> 00:39:13,151
they're incredible.

682
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:16,660
They train for four years to then go and
and do all these different screeners.

683
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:22,090
Uh, and for me not having spent four years
in the pool was costly because when it

684
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,760
came time for me to do this
screen or to go do mini buds,

685
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:28,010
it was basically a mini hell week
for four straight days. The academy,

686
00:39:28,011 --> 00:39:32,020
it was tough and we broke the ice and
the Chesapeake, all of that, you know,

687
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:34,270
I trained for it for two weeks.
Right.

688
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,450
I still had a shoulder problem in
hamstring prompt and the season,

689
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:40,130
I mean it was just not going to, I was
not going to compete with these guys for,

690
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,890
um, but ultimately what attracted
me was the Warner racket started.

691
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:49,540
Lot of my buddies were, were in the march
up that I had played with that were,

692
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,220
you know,
graduated before me.

693
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,040
I had talked to some folks that were in
special operations and seals and they

694
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:00,700
talked about it and it's a smaller team,
so it's a little bit different.

695
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:05,650
Whereas in the Marine Corps, the
leadership, you know, very young age,

696
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:08,440
you're going to have 40 some marines.

697
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,050
You'll go on to be a company
commander at this level,

698
00:40:11,051 --> 00:40:15,220
you're going to get a
legitimate opportunity to
command large scale units. And,

699
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,630
and that was really
appealing to me. Um, and,

700
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,370
and I thought that that was probably
the best opportunity for me because if I

701
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:23,200
was going to try to then be a team guy,

702
00:40:23,201 --> 00:40:25,840
I was going to have to go into the
navy as a surface warfare officer.

703
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:31,000
And then after two years and then after
two years as rough try to get to butts

704
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:34,990
and there's no guarantees. Being a
seal is extraordinarily competitive.

705
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,620
And the physical requirements as
officers to to get there are really,

706
00:40:38,621 --> 00:40:41,380
really high. And so for me, the,

707
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,270
the Marine Corps had an amazing appeal
and which we know about the Marine Corps.

708
00:40:46,271 --> 00:40:48,290
When you went to the Naval
Academy though? I wasn't. I,

709
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,400
I did as soon as I went to plebe
summer. Cause they run it, they run it.

710
00:40:51,401 --> 00:40:54,930
And I'll tell you a lot of the, a lot
of the people at the naval, Kevin,

711
00:40:54,931 --> 00:40:57,370
when I was there, hated
the marines. Really.

712
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,910
So many of them went there with
a chip on their shoulder. You,

713
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,350
this is the naval academy.

714
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,320
There's no marine corps stuff and
it's when we get our opportunity,

715
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:06,910
we're really going to be jerks.

716
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,620
And we had this great lieutenant colonel
when I was a senior and we had all been

717
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:15,820
selected to be Marines who told us, look
guys, this is not the real Marine Corp.

718
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:20,200
They're not representing as well. We've
got a bad crop here right now that are,

719
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,040
that are trying to prove a point.
When you get to the basic school,

720
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:27,970
you're gonna find that it's
massively different. And I loved,

721
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,410
I loved everything about it.
I loved the diversity of my marines.

722
00:41:32,411 --> 00:41:36,500
I mean we talk about race and race
is a big deal. Racism in our country,

723
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:40,140
it's a big topic. I mean there's
constantly battles on all the,

724
00:41:40,141 --> 00:41:42,890
the Hollywood news sites
going on about about race

725
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,940
didn't exist when I was
in the Marine Corps.

726
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,050
Men from all over the world, dark
green marine. It didn't matter. It did.

727
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:56,660
It did not matter if we
didn't care. Everybody, Hey,
this is so and so the salt.

728
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,190
We didn't care. We had a mission
every day. We trained together,

729
00:41:59,191 --> 00:42:01,890
we bled together and it was phenomenal.

730
00:42:01,891 --> 00:42:04,980
None of that stuff existed
because we won together.

731
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:08,400
We suffer together and
we look beyond all of it.

732
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:13,580
It just doesn't matter in the military
and it's so frustrating to see it.

733
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:18,660
It matters so much here in the regular
world where people have all kinds of

734
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:23,190
preconceived things and some people are
out there acting like they're fighting

735
00:42:23,191 --> 00:42:23,791
on for the,

736
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,570
for the better of of race relations in
our country and they're making it worse

737
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:30,390
because they've got their own
personal agenda as they do it.

738
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,310
It's just really frustrating.

739
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,920
Yeah. Well, I definitely in the,
in the military, like you said,

740
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,180
everyone's wearing the
same uniform and the,

741
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,220
I'm sure in the fifties and
sixties and even into the 70s,

742
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:46,790
it was a big deal and they stamped it
out because it, it, it doesn't matter.

743
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,010
There's no factor one way or the other.
It's no factor that it's pretty awesome.

744
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,290
Uh, yeah, went to the
basic school. You, uh,

745
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,150
you got stalled in the basic school
for a little bit of time and you know,

746
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,190
going through some legal stuff and while
you're stalled at the basic school,

747
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,270
your friends start going on deployment and

748
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,670
all of a sudden you got your
classmates, your friends, your brothers

749
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:23,340
are getting killed and you know,

750
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,460
that feeling of being on the sidelines.
Um,

751
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,470
I think it's really hard to
explain to people and you,

752
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:33,110
and you do a good job in the book that
I'll, I'll highlight a couple of times,

753
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:37,610
but, uh, I heard this quote
one time, man, I'm not,

754
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:42,170
I'm going to throw it out
there as best I can. But for,

755
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:43,603
for women,

756
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:48,610
like they have an intrinsic
biological desire to have children.

757
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,180
Not all women,
but a lot of women let's say,

758
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:55,610
and a lot of men

759
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,380
have an intrinsic desire to go to war.

760
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,360
I don't know why that is.

761
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:06,730
I know I had it since I can
remember having human emotions.

762
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,580
I wanted to go to war, you know
what I mean? When you're a kid,

763
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,120
the first thing you do when you pick up
a stick is you shape it into a gun and

764
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:18,040
start pointing it at your friends
and trying to kill them. Right.

765
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,500
So here you were on the
sidelines sitting back and,

766
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:28,760
and your friends are starting
to get killed. Well how,

767
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:31,980
what did that do to your psychology?
It was,

768
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,740
it was dark.
It was psychologically,

769
00:44:34,741 --> 00:44:37,050
that was the most challenging
time period of my life.

770
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:42,270
You've got someone challenging
your character and your
honor trying to say that

771
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:45,930
you, that you were something
that you weren't and I
wouldn't allow it. They were,

772
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:49,860
there were easier ways to speed up
the process and I refused. No Way.

773
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,350
I know what happened. And, and
during that delay it was a very,

774
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,040
very dark period and,
and it was difficult,

775
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:03,000
but you have to,
you have to slow life down some times,

776
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,230
gain perspective and realize, hey
look, this is going to take some time.

777
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,700
Eventually I am going to get there.
But what,

778
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:15,701
what really it turned into when the
opportunity finally came to progress using

779
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:21,420
my time wisely. The war wasn't
going to go away tomorrow. You know,

780
00:45:21,421 --> 00:45:23,340
sometimes you get this feeling
in your mind like, Oh man,

781
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:25,260
my friends are out there dying.
They're leading.

782
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,960
I need to be with them
right now realizing wall,

783
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,710
it's not going to be gone tomorrow.
So don't be so anxious.

784
00:45:31,711 --> 00:45:35,940
Don't waste the time you have
now to get better. What can I do?

785
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:40,920
I'm not going to let this stupid instance
hold me back from improving from when

786
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:43,320
I eventually do go on to lead marines.

787
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,650
And so I found a way to contribute value.

788
00:45:46,710 --> 00:45:50,640
I found a way to get better. It
didn't happen right away. You know,

789
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:53,190
there was a couple of weeks
where where it was dark,

790
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,960
where I was angry but I snapped out of
it because there's times in life where

791
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:01,920
life and your psychology,
they want it.

792
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,840
You want to be the victim,
right?

793
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:07,740
You want to feel like you've been wronged
and the problem is is a lot of times

794
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,830
when you go into that mode and
you start playing the victim,

795
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,470
you never crawl out of it.
You get stuck in that world of the victim.

796
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,130
You get stuck in this world that you
think is all bad lock and everything's

797
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:23,550
always going against you
and you stop driving.

798
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:27,780
You know your own life. You got to crawl
out of that. When, when, when your,

799
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:31,740
when your mind is telling you to play
the victim and to feel bad for yourself,

800
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,290
nothing positive comes from that.
Some nothing.

801
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,680
Did something specific snap you
out of that mindset that your,

802
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,870
your mom tell you something or you
must read it. They talk about that.

803
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,050
Oh that's right. That's right.
Yeah, she did. Is she my, my,

804
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:47,910
my mom is the sweetest
woman in the world too.

805
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:52,650
But there are specific time in my life
where she was extremely hard on me and

806
00:46:52,670 --> 00:46:55,620
they've mama stay where they were
at the right times. You would,

807
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:58,670
you'd meet her knight in a quick
kind of, she's such a pushover. Um,

808
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:02,970
but there were times where,
hey, you're going to fight this.

809
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,080
You understand me, you're
gonna fight this. You're right.

810
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,640
That's it. And you move
forward and, and you, oh,

811
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,690
just like we owe the,
the friends that you lose,

812
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,070
there are many different ways
that we could remember them,

813
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,200
that we can memorialize them. Some people
choose the wrong way, in my opinion,

814
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:29,790
substance, alcohol,
depression. You know, they,

815
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,180
they choose more of a victim
mindset way of remembering them.

816
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,100
Others choose, hey, there are no
longer here. I can't bring them back.

817
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,080
What would they want me to be doing?
What would make them proud?

818
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,130
I take their life for granted if I use
them as an excuse to be idle and fail.

819
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:55,060
Right? But I'm a more,
and if I remember them,

820
00:47:55,061 --> 00:48:00,061
speak their name and talk about
them as I move on and I succeed and,

821
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,780
and I still think about that.

822
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,610
I think about Ronnie Winchester who I
played football with who died now came

823
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:06,444
from Iraq.

824
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,820
I think about Brett Harmon who was
killed at an NC state football tailgater

825
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:13,240
before he could even lead
his platoon to battle.

826
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:16,570
And those incidents happen again
while you're on the sidelines.

827
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,730
And the other thing you started doing
right now at that time period is what does

828
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:25,210
that saying when the, when the student is
ready and instructor will appear? Well,

829
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:27,100
you ended up at the Marine Corps,

830
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:30,550
the Martial Arts Center for excellence
and you started training. I did.

831
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,340
I ran into to a colonel
named Joe [inaudible],

832
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,300
who is just this phenomenal guy,
all about character.

833
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,280
I mean in his sixties could outrun all
of us. I mean the epitome of discipline,

834
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,190
discipline, discipline.
And he brought me in.

835
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:50,191
I started working there and I got further
introduced into martial arts and I

836
00:48:50,831 --> 00:48:52,840
loved it. I found, hey,

837
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:57,700
this is what I should be doing in my
free time. I should be in heavy bags.

838
00:48:57,701 --> 00:49:00,490
I should be trained and I should be
watching tape. I need to beat we.

839
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:04,270
If I'm not reading military history
and learning about my enemy,

840
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,010
I'm doing this stuff,
this,

841
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,290
this is the type of stuff that's
going to keep my mind sharp.

842
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:12,220
And then I got intrigued. I wondered,
okay, I'm going to lead marines in combat.

843
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,080
And a lot of these books that they were
making us read on killing and some of

844
00:49:17,081 --> 00:49:19,770
these books that, that in my opinion
are a little off on the psychology,

845
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:23,630
the psychology of battle.
Agree. I mean, just brutal guy.

846
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:26,380
You're gonna pee yourself before
he gets shot at actually negative.

847
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:27,820
I'm not going to be myself,

848
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:34,660
so I wondered. All right, well what
can get me ready for that anxiety?

849
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:35,860
Sign up for a fight.

850
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,460
I had this master gunnery sergeant who
was a really good kickboxer who worked at

851
00:49:39,461 --> 00:49:42,220
this martial arts center of exos
and a master, a master guns.

852
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,850
Will you train me for fight?
Can you get me like one of these,

853
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,900
these martial arts fights out in
town? Yes sir. I can get you one.

854
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:54,580
Are you going to show up? Yeah, of course.
I'm going to show up. I don't know. Sorry.

855
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:57,520
I get a lot of you officers that don't.
So anyways,

856
00:49:57,521 --> 00:50:01,070
I convinced him to train me every morning
at five in the morning. We're training.

857
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:04,390
I had six weeks is fine. I don't
know much. Right. I've got,

858
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,800
I've got a black belt in the Marine
Corps martial arts program, right.

859
00:50:08,801 --> 00:50:13,090
That's an arm bar from the guard and
armbars from the mount a suite and how to

860
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:17,860
escape them out and I don't, I've
never shrimped before. All right.

861
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:21,910
I don't know. A Butterfly Guard is, I
have no clue at half guard is all right.

862
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,290
I've got a jab cross and [inaudible]
ready for your first, the black belt,

863
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:29,870
you said that was a black clothes black.
I've got a Jab, a cross in the lake.

864
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:33,820
Understand. Let me just,
all right, so I get it.

865
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,270
It was my first amateur fight.

866
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,960
We weigh in and the guys older than me
and he's got the same haircut as Chuck

867
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,380
Ladell and he's pretty ripped and so
you'd weigh in the same day as the fight.

868
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:45,140
So we all leave now it's time
to eat and then you come back.

869
00:50:45,141 --> 00:50:48,050
And so I come back and I'm,
I'm warm up and he hasn't shown up yet.

870
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,670
There's only a little sheet that they
hung off a bar in between us and our

871
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:55,460
fights come up in two fights. I'm
like, man, this guy may not show up.

872
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,020
So this is the perfect scenario for
me. He doesn't show, he was scared.

873
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,480
I go out with all my marine
buddies in the crowd or, I mean,

874
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:06,170
there's 50 people at despite and 15 and
we're there to watch me and that makes

875
00:51:06,171 --> 00:51:08,690
it work, right? And so, uh,

876
00:51:09,110 --> 00:51:11,870
he shows up and he's warming up.

877
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,670
He stretched and I'm like looking
through the sheet like, oh,

878
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:17,750
maybe I need to do some of that too, you
know, I don't want to tell them. Anyways,

879
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:20,450
we walked down this tarp,
the fight starts and this dude,

880
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:24,890
he hits me with the worst spinning
back fist you've ever seen. I mean,

881
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,680
slow motion off balance.
My head's so big.

882
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:29,000
Anything you throw at
it hits any damn way.

883
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,240
But it's me at the spinning back fist
and I'm starting to get embarrassed.

884
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:36,290
He's coming at me aggressive and and
now is that decision point. Okay,

885
00:51:36,291 --> 00:51:40,370
I can mentally break now and kind of
cover up and get outta here if this is a

886
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:41,300
little uncomfortable for me.

887
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:47,500
And at that point I kind of snapped and
I got mad and so I go to try and take

888
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:52,610
them down, which I have no wrestling
football. He read, I tried to football,

889
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,310
he wraps up a guillotine on me full on,

890
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:58,670
wraps the legs around my waist
and he is hammered it everything.

891
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:03,560
He's got you here and it's tight.
I make a few of the lights going on.

892
00:52:03,561 --> 00:52:07,340
I'm like, oh my goodness. No. And I
could hear his corner man yelling to him.

893
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,600
It's his wife.
It's now,

894
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:13,970
not only am I going to get
capped out in the first round,

895
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:18,110
I'm going to get tapped out to a fake
chocolate Lbu quarter by his wife,

896
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:22,810
finished in cherry phase two.
This does happen.

897
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:25,190
I find a way out of the choke.

898
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,220
I kicked him in the leg and realize
who I kick cardiac like that.

899
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:30,410
And then I'd crack him in the
forehead and I split his head open.

900
00:52:30,411 --> 00:52:35,020
The doctor comes in, he doesn't know what
month it is and the fights over. And,

901
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:38,690
and I had, there was a bunch of Vietnam
vets in the crowd and they're hammered.

902
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,870
And as soon as I get out these
dudes, these guys, he's crusty,

903
00:52:41,871 --> 00:52:45,040
fellas throw their arms are, I mean,
spilling beer all over me there.

904
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:46,090
They're feed me that,
you know,

905
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:48,200
they're putting the beer down
my throat from their cup with,

906
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:50,910
they got dips in there. I mean, this
stuff is probably disgusting. I hate,

907
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:56,240
but it takes it so good. And from
that moment on, I was hooked.

908
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,790
You know,
at this is this is what I should be doing.

909
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:03,560
I had six weeks of a fight on my
mind. If I can get used to that, how,

910
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:08,510
how will I deal with the anxiety
of, of unprepared for battle. Hey,

911
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:11,840
we're on patrol. You know, we get
contact. What's our media action?

912
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,420
Or we're going to have a major
operation coming up in six days.

913
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,690
I have to be able to think
clearly on the battlefield.

914
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,520
Direct lead play chess.
And so I thought, man,

915
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,590
this fighting thing could be a key.
It could be a help.

916
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,890
And it certainly did
not end up being that,

917
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,420
but it ended up being my
sanctuary through it all. It was,

918
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:37,380
it was kind of what centered me.
I brought typepad to Iraq the first time,

919
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,410
you know, I had one, oh one of my
sergeants, a pretty good martial arts.

920
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:42,900
We would train in between missions.
I would train my guys.

921
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,640
See that's the difference between the
seal teams and the and the Marine Corps.

922
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,940
You brought tie pads.
I brought maps

923
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:53,430
like I had Matt rooms. That's ridiculous.
The budget, the budget is much, much.

924
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,740
I know it seems like almost
embarrassing for me to admit. You know,

925
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:59,970
you also did a lot of
wrestling drills with uh,

926
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,260
with Travis Manion who was one of your,
one of your buddies.

927
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:05,050
And so he helped you out.
And there's a,

928
00:54:05,051 --> 00:54:09,010
there's an interesting part in,
in the book where you talk about,

929
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:14,590
you and Travis are going to,
Brett, who you just talked about,

930
00:54:14,591 --> 00:54:15,700
you're going to his funeral.

931
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:19,260
This is the guy was shot at some
little scuffle as he stayed.

932
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:21,700
Tailgater there's a real
shot in the chest and killed.

933
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:27,870
You guys are going to his funeral and
the wrestling coach tells you guys to

934
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:33,670
write your own eulogy for yourselves,

935
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,910
for yourselves. Interesting
drill. That's a,

936
00:54:37,911 --> 00:54:39,040
that's an interesting drill.

937
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,990
Joel share it.

938
00:54:39,991 --> 00:54:44,991
He is the head coach at the naval academy
wrestling team right now and it was

939
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:48,960
wild, you know, so Brett harm
was a marine infantry officer.

940
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:52,320
He was in third battalion, second marines,
which would be my eventual battalion.

941
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,980
Went to an NC state football tailgate or
there were some guys there drinking and

942
00:54:55,981 --> 00:54:59,130
driving and they almost
hit a kid and so they,

943
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:02,880
him and his buddy from Chicago civilian
right out front of the car and stopped

944
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:04,400
him and they got an argument.
What are you guys doing?

945
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,360
You know you guys are drunk. Should
be driving. The guys get out.

946
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:07,530
They started to scuffle Breton.

947
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:11,400
His buddy one came back a couple hours
later and shot them both point blank,

948
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,850
shot breadth buddy in the face and Brett
went to get them to take the gun from,

949
00:55:14,851 --> 00:55:16,230
he got shot in the chest and they died.

950
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,180
And so he was interesting because as
we were writing this eulogy, you know,

951
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,550
me and Travis,
we were so close and he was a,

952
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,320
he was a fantastic wrestler and one of
the toughest human beings I've ever known.

953
00:55:28,321 --> 00:55:31,980
I mean what we used to do to each other
was ridiculous training. I mean if it,

954
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:34,890
as long as it was standing, I
would, I would just destroy them.

955
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,470
As soon as he got sick of that and
wanted to tackle me on the ground,

956
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,240
I wasn't getting up anymore
and he was destroying me.

957
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:43,830
But it would just go back and forth for
hours and instead of playing video games,

958
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:45,630
drinking beer,
going out and hitting on girls,

959
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,210
that's what me and Travis would
do on a Friday and Saturday night.

960
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,020
And it was really tough when
you really start to think,

961
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:56,490
what do you want to be said
when it's all over for you?

962
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,560
How do you want to be? Remember?
And, and I remember Travis,

963
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:05,310
he really struggled with this
struggled. I mean, it was, I mean,

964
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:08,330
he was so loud talking about that it
real from the plane. It was weird. And,

965
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:11,580
and part of it was because we were just
struggling with the fact that, you know,

966
00:56:11,581 --> 00:56:15,390
our friend is dead, you know,
for such a weird circumstance.

967
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,660
Yet we can understand if it was an IED
or a snipe or something that and that,

968
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:22,530
not this. And, you know,

969
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:26,650
several years later it was
wild. But, uh, you know,

970
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:31,210
Joel share it when he would give Travis's
eulogy, he brought that story up.

971
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,370
Travis would get killed in Fallujah.

972
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,710
And I remember driving up to
Travis this funeral and Ah,

973
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,220
you know, Travis is one of those guys that
you just, you just never, he can't die.

974
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,000
He's Jesus. Too Bad. He's too
tough. He's too smart, too good.

975
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,650
So remember driving up to
the funeral and I had my,

976
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,000
my wife there with me and she was actually
trying to make plans for their twin

977
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,340
sister. Hey, we're going to be in
town. We live in North Carolina.

978
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:55,600
Let's get together this weekend.

979
00:56:55,601 --> 00:56:58,300
But her twin sister's husband
didn't want to get together.

980
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,230
There was a part of me that
didn't Travis's in debt like,

981
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,630
I'm going to get there and we're all
gonna, we're gonna hang out tonight.

982
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,890
And I remember when I walked into that
week and I actually saw him, I mean it,

983
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,450
it hit me like a ton of
bricks. It was brutal. I loved,

984
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:19,000
love that guy so much and we carried
him the next day. But uh, you know,

985
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,670
it's just,
it's so crazy how connected it was because

986
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,530
Ronnie Winchester died in,

987
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:30,910
I'll Chi my rack and three days later,

988
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:33,370
Brett and died at that
NC state football game.

989
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:39,040
We would go to Brett Harmon's
funeral, right? Or on eulogies,

990
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:39,891
which you'll share it,

991
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:44,380
who would then end up giving Travis
Mannion his you has actually eulogy and I

992
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:45,880
would carry Travis to his grave.

993
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,750
I went to al Qaeda in Iraq and actually
replaced Ronnie's platoon and turned

994
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:55,630
over with the replacement
platoon commander who took
over for him when he passed.

995
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:00,280
While I was an infantry officer course
JP blacksmith was killed. And Felicia,

996
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:05,470
and I got this a little out of
order, but when, when JP died,

997
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:08,980
I found out right before I
had my last amateur fight,

998
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:10,330
I was an infantry officer course.

999
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,730
And I'm getting ready to
fight in two hours for,

1000
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:16,030
for a title Travis Mannion
with my corner man.

1001
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,240
And we're in the hotel room and he got
a call and then he looked like he had

1002
00:58:19,241 --> 00:58:21,760
seen a ghost like trap. What's
wrong? You have nothing to do.

1003
00:58:21,761 --> 00:58:25,980
I'll tell you after the fight. And we,
you know, we had gotten bad like, no,

1004
00:58:25,981 --> 00:58:27,490
I know something's up.
What the hell happened?

1005
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,420
Travis told me do JP blacksmith
got killed in Fallujah.

1006
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:32,310
So Travis tells you about jps death.

1007
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:37,170
I turned over with jps
company, my second tour, it's,

1008
00:58:37,171 --> 00:58:40,290
I met all of his old marines, all of his
own platoon commanders. And it's just,

1009
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,150
it's such a small world that we lived
and breathed then, you know, and,

1010
00:58:45,151 --> 00:58:47,310
and so in,
in my little platoon commanders notebook,

1011
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:48,510
I had pictures of all of them.

1012
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,720
And before every mission I would
flip through and you just think,

1013
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:55,170
how do I make them proud?
Before every fight,

1014
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,080
I would look at their pictures and
look at the pictures of my marines.

1015
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:00,600
How do I make them proud?
How do I make them proud?

1016
00:59:00,601 --> 00:59:05,601
And I still think about it to this day
and I end a lot of my speeches on this

1017
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,000
and mean they no longer
have the chance to live.

1018
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,280
Who am I to take this life for granted?

1019
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,530
Because they would give
anything to have one more day.

1020
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:16,650
Their families who would give
anything to have one more day.

1021
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:19,980
And I try to remind myself
of that all the time.

1022
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,270
And you don't have to in the military to
think like that. People look into, well,

1023
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:27,770
that's extreme. Well, who have you lost
in your life? What would make them proud?

1024
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,610
How do you truly memorialize them?
It's certainly not through failure.

1025
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,960
It's not they're being idle in life.
Live a life of substance,

1026
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:40,580
not just existence in that you know,
as you do that and you remember them,

1027
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:44,000
that makes them proud, that that makes
it, that makes it worth it. You know,

1028
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,350
it's very similar to that,

1029
00:59:45,351 --> 00:59:49,370
that final scene in saving private
Ryan where he's like, did I earn it?

1030
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,451
You know?

1031
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:53,390
And for those of us who served and wearing
in those great circumstances or for

1032
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:54,200
those people,

1033
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,540
there's people that were in tragedies
where they were in car accidents.

1034
00:59:56,541 --> 00:59:58,220
They lost people.
They think the same way.

1035
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,240
They think a lot the way they do that
we do when we look at life and taking

1036
01:00:02,241 --> 01:00:05,690
things for granted. Um, and
achieving every day adding value.

1037
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:11,210
Yeah. The darkness in the world regardless
of, uh, regardless of where you are.

1038
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,880
You, um, you know, speaking
of your combat tours, I want,

1039
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:21,881
I want to kind of dive into those
a little bit and let's take you,

1040
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:25,160
you take over your platoon.
You're a platoon commander. Now,

1041
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,630
back to the book here,
during our first platoon meeting,

1042
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:32,390
my introductory speech
lasted less than two minutes.

1043
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,140
We're going to be aggressive.
I told my new command,

1044
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,600
we're going to train our asses
off and we're going to be,

1045
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:41,270
and we're going to work harder
than anyone else in the battalion.

1046
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:46,700
That was it short to the point,
all business.

1047
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:51,140
What's more, they found out
quickly. I wasn't kidding.

1048
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:56,750
So you, you guys work
hard, you get prepared,

1049
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,990
you deploy to Al came,
which you just talked about.

1050
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:04,310
That's where you ended up going
and I'm jumping ahead a little bit.

1051
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,820
People are going to have to read this
whole book themselves, but you're,

1052
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:11,670
you're basically now setting
up a position on a bridge.

1053
01:01:11,671 --> 01:01:14,140
You're kind of a blocking force
in his bridge, prevent uh,

1054
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,890
enemy from consolidating on another area
where there's another operation going

1055
01:01:18,891 --> 01:01:23,891
on and I'm going to the book mortars
began to fall on our position as we fought

1056
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:26,870
back. I made sure that our vehicles
moved from one spot to another.

1057
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:31,930
So the mortar Cruz would not zero in on
us from a wadi that ran perpendicular

1058
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:35,090
route. Emerald, several
insurgents began lobbying,

1059
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:39,860
rocket propelled grenades at us.
The rockets exploded all around us.

1060
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:43,670
Then another heavy machine gun let loose
this one sided on the north bank as

1061
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:48,230
well. We were caught in 180
degree crossfire from my window.

1062
01:01:48,231 --> 01:01:51,440
I could see Corporal
Delatour and Bravo one,

1063
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,340
they were taking the brunt of the fire
and delatour briefly dipped out of the

1064
01:01:55,341 --> 01:01:58,250
Turret as bullets bounced
off the Humvees armored skin.

1065
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:03,290
Then I saw his hand pop up above the
blast shield holding a video camera.

1066
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:09,010
It takes a rare kind of cool to do
something like that in combat and infantry

1067
01:02:09,141 --> 01:02:12,890
platoons first task at to achieve
fire superiority over the enemy.

1068
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:17,660
To do this requires pouring it on the
insurgence until they are forced to either

1069
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:21,360
disengage or go to ground.
Once they're even driven off,

1070
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,160
either driven off or pinned in place,

1071
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,660
you've gained command to the fight and
can dictate what happens next even with

1072
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:30,150
the tanks because I failed to mentioned
you had some tanks from army tanks with

1073
01:02:30,151 --> 01:02:33,510
you and you, uh,

1074
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:38,690
throughout the book have the same deep
love for tanks that I have for RB tags,

1075
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:45,720
Marie Techs, but I love tanks
even with the tanks. In this case,

1076
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,750
we didn't have the fire power
to gain control of this battle.

1077
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:52,380
There were too many insurgent shooting
at us from too many different places.

1078
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:55,100
We needed some help.
I reached for the radios,

1079
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,750
headset began calling air
strikes within minutes.

1080
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,670
Huey Cobra gunships thundered in all
unseen to deliver deadly Accurate Hellfire

1081
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,410
missiles into targets we identified.

1082
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:07,920
So was this situation here,

1083
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,920
was that like your first
big combat scenario?

1084
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,270
It was,
it wasn't.

1085
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:17,300
The thing that made it so difficult was
there was another platoon assigned for

1086
01:03:17,661 --> 01:03:21,640
that mission. Right. And they
got stuck, stuck in the mud,

1087
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:27,290
in the mud and, and so we didn't get the
opportunity to aerial reconnaissance.

1088
01:03:27,291 --> 01:03:31,370
We didn't have the opportunity to look
at overhead imagery of this terrain.

1089
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:35,960
We had nothing. I had 15 minutes, hey,
if they're not there in 15 minutes,

1090
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:40,370
you're a go. So in that 15 minutes, I'm
briefing my guys, we're getting ready,

1091
01:03:40,371 --> 01:03:43,460
we're now, we're meeting this, this
tank crew is from Boise, Idaho.

1092
01:03:43,461 --> 01:03:45,470
We'd never even met them.
I met them the day before.

1093
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:47,150
My guys had never worked with them before.

1094
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,580
So there was a lot of confusion that
took place just in the, in the route up.

1095
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:56,570
And as we got settled and started
identify targets, and as you know,

1096
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:01,370
in that scenario,
the acoustics and in the movement,

1097
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:02,390
the amount of people,

1098
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,520
we are the most precise military
in the history of this planet.

1099
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:12,170
So we not only have to identify
where is the gunfire coming from,

1100
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:16,820
what caliber do I believe they're
firing back or at us with,

1101
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:21,890
because that dictates what caliber
I'm allowed to return fire with.

1102
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:25,040
Depending on where they're
shooting at me from.

1103
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:28,760
Are they in a dug in position north of
the river or they shooting at me from a

1104
01:04:28,761 --> 01:04:30,320
building where they're civilians around?

1105
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:34,070
Are they shooting at me from a wadi
where now I can drop hellfires on them.

1106
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:35,150
I can hit them with tanks.

1107
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:40,100
That's a lot going through your
head when you've got four vehicles,

1108
01:04:40,101 --> 01:04:44,330
two tanks and aircraft you're trying
to control as a 24 year old kid and

1109
01:04:44,331 --> 01:04:48,710
everybody's waiting on you to say what's
coming next. Just like in every vehicle,

1110
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:52,690
there's another kid in there directing
everything they're doing and, and,

1111
01:04:52,691 --> 01:04:56,030
and that is, that is all part of
it. But that, that was our first,

1112
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:58,880
our first time when Delatorre
I don't put in the book,

1113
01:04:58,881 --> 01:05:01,380
but what I said to him
over the radio, I mean, I,

1114
01:05:01,450 --> 01:05:04,580
I verbally almost killed him
through the radio for doing it,

1115
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:06,610
that wild son of a bitch.
I've told him

1116
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:11,100
the story on the podcast,
but I had a similar story.
I'll tell it again right now.

1117
01:05:11,101 --> 01:05:15,250
Cause Mikey Monster, who ended up
getting killed in Ramadi, metal of honor,

1118
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:19,330
uh, I went to go to his little station
where he was and the guys were like, Hey,

1119
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:22,090
do you see Mikey's video? And I
was like, no, let let you know.

1120
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,720
And they'll go take a look at
Mikey's video. So Mikey was a, uh,

1121
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:28,390
a heavy weapons gunner
and carry the mark 48.

1122
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:31,840
And so I go back into his little
word Camp Corregidor in Ramadi.

1123
01:05:31,841 --> 01:05:34,240
I go back and do a little Hoochie,
a built from south. I'm like, Mikey,

1124
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:37,270
let me see your, let me see your video.
And he goes, I'll Roger that sir.

1125
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:41,620
So he pulls out a little camera and he
shows the video and there's a massive

1126
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:44,860
firefight going on in the lob district of,
of Ramadi,

1127
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:48,140
and he's got the camera up and you
can see it ducked out or go up.

1128
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,720
He's filming everything and
he gets done showing me an,

1129
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,180
and at one point and the in the video,

1130
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:55,880
he turns the camera at himself
and he goes, it's the Mooloolaba,

1131
01:05:55,890 --> 01:05:59,560
which was just classic Mikey and this.
So it gets done.

1132
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,850
And of course I'm all hardcore
and I go, hey Mike, bro,

1133
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:07,480
what are you doing out there?
You know, you're in a firefight.

1134
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:10,870
You need to be on your pig gut getting
rounds down and killing bad guys.

1135
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:15,430
He's like, sir, I'm sorry
I was, I was Winchester.

1136
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,770
He had no, you already dumped a
thousand rounds. And I was like, Hey,

1137
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,910
all right Mike, you're good, you're
fine. All you want if you go Winchester.

1138
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,430
But yeah, I was thinking, how
did I read that? I was like,

1139
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:29,980
you probably weren't too happy about that.

1140
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:32,880
I was so mad.
So mad.

1141
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,320
Another thing.

1142
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:37,500
Let me just give you this prompt and
you're going to hear this too. When,

1143
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:38,040
when you,

1144
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,800
when you get off this podcast and people
are going to hit you up on social media,

1145
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,450
you're going to hear from young soul,

1146
01:06:42,510 --> 01:06:45,720
you're gonna hear from
soldiers and marines that are
going to ask you questions

1147
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:48,840
because they listened to this
and they get knowledge from it.

1148
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,090
Is there anything that you didn't expect
that you wish somebody would have told

1149
01:06:54,091 --> 01:06:56,230
you going into that first firefight?

1150
01:06:56,250 --> 01:07:00,540
For someone that's in basic training right
now or at the basic school right now?

1151
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:04,440
Anything that you piece of advice
you'd give them. Yeah, you know,

1152
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,320
a few things. You know, one

1153
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:14,090
go in their guns ablazing right away
because in that circumstance the sound is

1154
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,720
actually one of your better indicators
are where the gunfire is coming from.

1155
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:22,080
Cause when that heat is blazing,
you're not going to see a muzzle flash.

1156
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,860
It's just doesn't exist. Right.
The other thing is when you're,

1157
01:07:25,861 --> 01:07:28,440
when you are keeping your vehicles mobile,

1158
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,520
that doesn't allow you to lock in on a
t and e system with a heavy machine gun.

1159
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,230
So you've got to be smart
in the increments that you
move in and the formations

1160
01:07:37,231 --> 01:07:38,950
you move in and make sure that your,

1161
01:07:38,951 --> 01:07:41,990
your machine gunners have
drilled that we would do,

1162
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:45,940
we would do t and he drills till my
guy's hands bled and not just the,

1163
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:48,960
the primary machine gunner. Everybody
in that trucks have one goes down,

1164
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:50,490
the other comes up so that it,

1165
01:07:50,491 --> 01:07:53,700
when we moved them they can quickly
get back on that same target.

1166
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,780
Cause basically what that became a game
of is you suppress that position with a

1167
01:07:57,781 --> 01:08:01,350
two 40 golfer, a medium machine gun
until I can talk the tank top on.

1168
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:03,900
And then the tanks, they don't miss. It's
all computer. It's like a video game.

1169
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:07,440
And we'd dug in positions, just aim a
little bit lower and watch the shit fly,

1170
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:11,010
excuse my language. Um, but that,

1171
01:08:11,011 --> 01:08:14,760
that was one of the prompts when when we
went in and we started receiving some,

1172
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,480
everybody started shooting fire
where we can identify with.

1173
01:08:17,481 --> 01:08:19,030
But then also we're getting
shot at from other positions.

1174
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,730
We can't really tell because
of the acoustics until
somebody actually hits wait,

1175
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,070
waiting.

1176
01:08:23,070 --> 01:08:26,510
But we're getting hit for back here too
and then some of the increments might,

1177
01:08:26,530 --> 01:08:28,130
my drivers would move in.

1178
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:32,240
They move so much that it was no longer
a small adjustment on the teeny for that

1179
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:33,074
machine gunner.

1180
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:37,400
Now they've got to get out of the turret
exposing themselves to work that thing

1181
01:08:37,401 --> 01:08:41,390
in and because of collateral damage,
you can't just work it in,

1182
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:44,420
send some rounds downrange, oops,
I hit the building 10 feet away.

1183
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:45,320
You're not allowed to do that.

1184
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:48,650
You've got to get that sucker into where
you see it on the site and then you can

1185
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:49,730
start sending around down.

1186
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:53,420
Well that guy gets to shoot at you because
you're so concerned with collateral

1187
01:08:53,421 --> 01:08:57,500
damage. And so drill, drill,

1188
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,570
drill because a mortar,

1189
01:08:59,571 --> 01:09:03,650
drop it on the top of a of a Humvee
is not a good thing and they are more

1190
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:06,170
accurate than you realize that these,

1191
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:11,240
the enemy out there has been launching
mortars in indirect fire for decades

1192
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:15,080
where you get a little bit of Ammo
to do it on range 400 out. You know,

1193
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:16,030
I'll out in the,

1194
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,150
out in the palms from marines edits these
guys get to do it everyday for real.

1195
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,950
Yeah. And you know what? They
don't even have to be good.

1196
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:23,930
They'd get lucky one time.
And,

1197
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,550
and human life doesn't mean anything
to them, but it means everything to us.

1198
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:31,400
So they get lucky one time and there's,
there's,

1199
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:35,240
that's the way it goes and
that's the way combat is. Um,

1200
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:36,703
okay.

1201
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:43,200
So you get done with that and,

1202
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,950
and tank hits an IED.

1203
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,320
You need to find out what's going on.
And basically there's a,

1204
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,750
there's a burning Abrams here going on.

1205
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:58,560
Suddenly a huge explosion drowned
out all other battle sounds.

1206
01:09:58,561 --> 01:10:02,250
The ground rolled and shook as if the
fault line had suddenly collapsed beneath

1207
01:10:02,251 --> 01:10:04,440
us ahead. A maelstrom of sand, dirt,

1208
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:08,750
smoke and flames boiled skyward before
I could even ask Sergeant Peterson's

1209
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:13,680
voice came over, the radio mortar hit one
of the tanks, my column break to a stop.

1210
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,670
The explosion morphed into
a dry eye into a small,

1211
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:21,450
dirty brown mushroom cloud
over staff sergeant plump keys.

1212
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:26,460
[inaudible] no way a mortar did that.
That had to have been massive IED.

1213
01:10:27,210 --> 01:10:30,450
Luke Miller called over to me.
I have no comms with them.

1214
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,960
So now you radio for a med evac.
You're trying to find out what's going on.

1215
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:37,050
The tanks on fire and here we go.
Back to the book,

1216
01:10:37,051 --> 01:10:39,960
I took a deep breath and
ran for the burning Abrams.

1217
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:44,730
I took only a few steps before I saw a
Robertson frantically waving back at me.

1218
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,830
We are sorry,
waving me back.

1219
01:10:47,010 --> 01:10:51,090
Just then a line of bullets stitched
across the sand about 10 feet ahead of me.

1220
01:10:51,690 --> 01:10:55,470
I executed my best football shuttle
run and dashed back for cover.

1221
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,190
Bravo three laid down suppressing fire,

1222
01:10:59,191 --> 01:11:03,330
which allowed me to get across the
open space on my second attempt.

1223
01:11:03,331 --> 01:11:05,700
So let's cover moving on another
thing, chapter in the book. So I'm,

1224
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,190
I talk about all the time.
This is the fundamental,

1225
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,670
there's a fundamental tactic that's
that's what it is. Covered move.

1226
01:11:11,790 --> 01:11:14,160
Then you guys are doing it right here.
When

1227
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,310
I reached Robertson, he shouted and
we still got two wounded in there.

1228
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:18,840
We had to get the men out quickly.

1229
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,960
I climbed onto the tank Miller
following a short time later,

1230
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:25,620
the incoming fire was heavy and more than
once we had to duck behind the turret.

1231
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,080
So getting your,
getting your game on Brian Stann kid.

1232
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:36,960
The funny thing about it was I was trying
to maintain a low profile when I got

1233
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:38,220
in the tank.
There's things,

1234
01:11:38,221 --> 01:11:43,221
there's little micro things you can hide
behind and the drivers that the person

1235
01:11:44,191 --> 01:11:48,220
deepest in that thing and we couldn't
get him out. He was the last one and,

1236
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:51,330
and he was a bigger guy and I'm,
I'm trying to lift them as strong dude.

1237
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:53,550
And I lifted way till I was
in Iraq and Al is a strong,

1238
01:11:53,551 --> 01:11:55,050
bigger guy than I am right now.

1239
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,350
Couldn't get him out and I couldn't
and I couldn't understand why.

1240
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:00,270
And he's looking at me, he's, he's
got blood all over me. It's like,

1241
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:03,990
why is this taking so long? And he
doesn't say it that clear. I mean he's,

1242
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:04,824
he's out of it.

1243
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,220
I didn't know at the time he was
paralyzed from the chest down there.

1244
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:12,240
And so I realized the only way I'm
getting him out is if I get my legs

1245
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,310
underneath me and that's
going to create a target.

1246
01:12:15,270 --> 01:12:19,740
And so we think sometimes we
think some silly things in combat.

1247
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,140
And I just thought, look, if I'm
going to get shot by these guys,

1248
01:12:22,141 --> 01:12:24,240
what's the last thing I want
them to see before they hit me?

1249
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:28,380
And that's my rear end. So when I hopped
up, I, I faced that rate towards the foot.

1250
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:31,600
I honestly think, I think
it would save me, you know,

1251
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:35,760
you'll talk to two people that hunt
and they talk about when they get that

1252
01:12:35,761 --> 01:12:40,590
perfect buck in their sites, huge
rack. And it's such an easy shop,

1253
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:43,950
but they're so excited that they
pulled a shot and they miss well,

1254
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:47,400
when I've got a Kevlar helmet on,

1255
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,780
I look who's seen Spaceballs
well, yeah, I mean,

1256
01:12:51,810 --> 01:12:55,680
you can see right now it's just the
headset. When I've got to Kevlar on,

1257
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:59,610
I mean if someone's trying to snipe me
or they're trying to shoot at me with a

1258
01:12:59,611 --> 01:13:04,530
medium machine gun and they see, they're
like, oh man, I got this dude they missed.

1259
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:08,270
And I squat, I was able to pull them
up and we literally, you know, we,

1260
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:10,320
we almost collapsed off the tank and,

1261
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:13,620
and landed on top of another
guy and got him down. Um,

1262
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:16,440
but the only thing I could think of,
I mean obviously grateful when we landed,

1263
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:19,350
Hey, I don't think I got
shot. Did you get hit?

1264
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:22,410
He didn't get hit and we were able
to get them out. But that was,

1265
01:13:22,411 --> 01:13:25,710
that was what I think happened is
sometimes you just get lucky and I think I

1266
01:13:25,711 --> 01:13:27,330
presented such a big target,

1267
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,350
whoever was behind that trigger
just straight delusion. Yeah.

1268
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:36,150
That's a nightmare too. I'll tell you
when, when this enemy sees a down vehicle,

1269
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:40,770
it is like a bullet magnet. The fact
that you survived that is ridiculous.

1270
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:45,480
And yeah, it must, it is a miracle and
luck and everything else because when,

1271
01:13:45,481 --> 01:13:48,090
when the enemy sees a
target like that man,

1272
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:51,000
they just pour fire onto it cause
they know there's creating a total

1273
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:54,600
catastrophic situation for us. And they
almost always have a camera on it too.

1274
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:59,490
Yeah. I mean they are there for film.
It, it didn't, I couldn't find it.

1275
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:03,360
But they study film, like
NFL teams, study film,

1276
01:14:03,361 --> 01:14:05,850
and sometimes you find their footage
where they didn't even attack you.

1277
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:09,060
They're just watching what your response
was to see what they're going to do

1278
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:13,420
next. People underestimate the evil
and the detail that they go through.

1279
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:17,980
Maybe Akhmed the sniper decided to delete
that video because he was going to get

1280
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:20,450
in so much trouble for this
and the big heading of America.

1281
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:25,890
How did you visit this guy?
Look at the size of

1282
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,130
a,

1283
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:34,090
so you call him actually,
you called an a helicopters.

1284
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:38,440
They come in under fire.
Don't take any hits.

1285
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,540
Somehow miraculously have been,

1286
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:44,320
I've not been able to find
who was flying that Huey.

1287
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:49,920
I never was able to find out and I mean
I wish I could that that guy who landed

1288
01:14:50,531 --> 01:14:54,310
because a whole squad was taken out a
few clicks to our east and there was no

1289
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:56,350
med evac birds and this guy,

1290
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,800
I mean we laid down in the butterfly
trigger so that he could land, but man,

1291
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:02,980
he showed some guts.
He would've been fired had they got hit.

1292
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,050
It had that halo going down,
but he didn't care.

1293
01:15:05,051 --> 01:15:08,290
He knew there was a marine there that
needed to get out and need to get out now

1294
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:12,070
or else he was done and, and he
landed, got him and lifted off.

1295
01:15:12,071 --> 01:15:15,350
And I never saw him again. I'm telling
you that that's, that's a real,

1296
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:20,410
I was a marine corps as a marine pilot
and in a Huey of all things a Huey,

1297
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:25,630
um, that took some stones and I wish,
I wish I could find that person,

1298
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:28,810
hear this podcast reach out.
So I hope so.

1299
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:34,140
Now you get that back
to base helacious run

1300
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,343
and

1301
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,070
you guys get back. Yeah.
Great. We survived.

1302
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,560
And then you get re tasked,

1303
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,290
you got to go bring ammo weapons or sorry,

1304
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,590
Emma water fuel back up there.

1305
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:50,070
[inaudible] and

1306
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:53,770
this was an interesting, I got this
and I kind of brought it up earlier,

1307
01:15:53,771 --> 01:15:54,910
but back to the book,

1308
01:15:54,911 --> 01:15:59,911
just before we rolled out my alpha section
arrived back at [inaudible] after a

1309
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:04,390
very dull day covering the jump off
point for the assault force tasked with

1310
01:16:04,391 --> 01:16:08,110
crossing the afraid he's,
they encountered no opposition.

1311
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:13,210
And my Bravo section. Marines quickly
busted out the stories of our busy day,

1312
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,030
much to the jealousy of
the rest of the platoon.

1313
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:20,440
This is what I was trying to explain
earlier. So these guys, you know,

1314
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,470
these guys were in a crazy firefight,
almost get killed.

1315
01:16:23,471 --> 01:16:27,490
They got guys getting wounded,
they come back and the other other squad,

1316
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:31,240
he had no action and what are they?
They're jealous and mad

1317
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:35,170
alpha section was so full of aggressive,

1318
01:16:35,171 --> 01:16:37,300
angry marines who wanted nothing
more to get into the fight.

1319
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:41,740
They lobbied to go out on this run.
But I vetoed the idea.

1320
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:45,070
Sergeant Pete's men knew the terrain
now and we needed that experience to

1321
01:16:45,071 --> 01:16:47,020
shepherd the two trucks to the bridge.

1322
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,080
I told my alpha section it and plenty
of opportunities in the days to come,

1323
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:54,700
but I knew as we left the
wire, they remained on the
base. Frustrated and anxious.

1324
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:57,940
That's just tells you
what the Marine Corps

1325
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,630
is all about. Hated me
that night, I'm sure.

1326
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:06,620
And then, okay, so you do, that's
another hell run. And again,

1327
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:10,070
I'm not going to read your entire book.
People can buy this book and

1328
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:13,680
read it,
but when you get back again,

1329
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:16,460
another just crazy run. When
you get back, guess what?

1330
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:19,160
You got to go back to the bridge again.

1331
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:20,890
Okay,

1332
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:24,220
that's good times. So here
you go. Back to the book.

1333
01:17:24,221 --> 01:17:27,070
We're going back to the bridge tonight.
I started Alpha,

1334
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:29,800
sat out the last couple of fights.
They were fresh and eager and ready.

1335
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:31,180
Go in the fray right now.

1336
01:17:31,181 --> 01:17:35,980
Bravo section had all the bragging
rights and that was driving Francis's men

1337
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:39,400
nuts. When I broke the
news, I like this park.

1338
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:42,670
When I broke the news I saw
no fear in anyone's eyes.

1339
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:47,440
Just anticipation and excitement.
Be careful what you wish for.

1340
01:17:47,441 --> 01:17:52,000
I thought
so again,

1341
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:57,150
marines are fired up to
go and you go out again

1342
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,920
and this one again goes sideways.
You,

1343
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:06,400
you're using up all your nine man. This.
This one got ugly quick and you know,

1344
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,050
we expected it to,
but there was,

1345
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:12,040
there were things working against us a
little bit in that we had to go up there,

1346
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:16,390
the tank that had the
catastrophic hill days earlier,

1347
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,750
we had to go up there and recover it.
You can't leave that in the battlefield.

1348
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:25,090
And so I had never even, I had never
known what a Mike 88 recovery vehicle was.

1349
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,680
I learned that in Ramadi as well.
It's,

1350
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:32,860
it's a tank with no guns and it's
basically it's, it's a mechanic vehicle.

1351
01:18:32,861 --> 01:18:35,470
They go fix the other
tank or they told him,

1352
01:18:35,950 --> 01:18:38,740
and so we were going
to meet a tank section,

1353
01:18:38,741 --> 01:18:43,741
so to regular Abrams tanks plus this Mike
88 tank recovery vehicle in the middle

1354
01:18:43,751 --> 01:18:46,600
of the desert. Here's, here's
your grid. We'll meet there.

1355
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:50,980
I'm going to kick my order there. I've
never even met these marines before. Hey,

1356
01:18:50,981 --> 01:18:54,190
by the way, here's your introduction
to my alpha section, by the way,

1357
01:18:54,191 --> 01:18:58,560
to we're going to head straight north
and try and catch them by surprise and,

1358
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,330
and get right up to the
bridge. But I told them, look,

1359
01:19:01,331 --> 01:19:04,390
this area has been heavily guarded,
so be prepared.

1360
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:09,070
Well this master started, who's driving
the mic? 88 lets me know, hey sir,

1361
01:19:09,071 --> 01:19:11,560
just so you know,
once we get on that ass fall,

1362
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:15,520
this thing only going to go
about 10 miles an hour at best.

1363
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:18,910
What as you started wait one,

1364
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:24,270
we're good on sand when we don't go very
fast on on asphalt and like well you

1365
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:26,250
don't want to go on sand.

1366
01:19:26,251 --> 01:19:29,500
You know what they buried in sand force
and what they have waiting for us there.

1367
01:19:30,490 --> 01:19:33,010
So man we hit the line of departure.

1368
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:37,870
We had north and they opened up
on us and that my kth is crawling,

1369
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:42,970
crawling and my section
leader steps are in France.

1370
01:19:42,971 --> 01:19:46,870
His vehicle gets hit with an
RPG just missed by an IED,

1371
01:19:46,871 --> 01:19:51,520
but the back of the vehicle is on fire
and, and when we're getting hit to tank,

1372
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:55,180
start returning fire.
And here's another really good lesson for,

1373
01:19:55,181 --> 01:19:58,360
for young officers and and and just
young service members in general.

1374
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:03,220
When you're fighting at night and you
got night vision goggles on and and tanks

1375
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:06,220
are returning fire into these buildings,
right? They were shooting down on us.

1376
01:20:06,221 --> 01:20:08,880
And these buildings shooting has to
windows to the tanks or identity.

1377
01:20:08,881 --> 01:20:11,820
We're identifying targets and
they're taking them out the debris.

1378
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:16,110
It's heavy that the material
that these buildings are made of,

1379
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,730
it's very heavy in a blindness.

1380
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,900
Couldn't see now because all the damage
that tanks did and my lead vehicle blew

1381
01:20:21,901 --> 01:20:25,830
the turn back of the vehicles on fire.
They blow the turn.

1382
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,440
So we all blow the turn and link back up.

1383
01:20:28,441 --> 01:20:30,110
And now as I looked
down the block headache,

1384
01:20:30,111 --> 01:20:34,020
it's see these lights Blinken
which typically tells us
it's signaling an ambush.

1385
01:20:34,021 --> 01:20:38,430
They're expecting us to go
that route now, decision time,

1386
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:42,690
and you gotta be quick. So at that
time we're about to, we're going, hey,

1387
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:43,620
let's turn the company around.

1388
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:45,990
Let's hit the turn where we know we're
going to get right to the people that

1389
01:20:45,991 --> 01:20:48,940
need us right to that down tank. Let's
fight our way through this kills, oh,

1390
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:49,351
let me call.

1391
01:20:49,351 --> 01:20:52,860
And some air strikes that time is when
they let loose those suicide vehicles and

1392
01:20:52,861 --> 01:20:56,710
one got through our
perimeter and man, I've, I've

1393
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:02,460
one of the Marines actually
filmed that explosion and

1394
01:21:04,170 --> 01:21:05,250
just a horrible femi.

1395
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:08,280
I heard that explosion and just the
first thing went through my head.

1396
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:10,620
I just got five kids killed immediately.

1397
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:15,210
It's the first thing that went through
my head radio silence and everybody's

1398
01:21:15,211 --> 01:21:17,970
waiting for, there's no crying, there's
no morning, there's no time out.

1399
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:20,190
There's no hey staffs are and
Robertson. You take over. No,

1400
01:21:20,191 --> 01:21:22,020
I mean after that thought,
my next,

1401
01:21:22,050 --> 01:21:25,980
my next thing needs to be me giving
orders out of my mouth and moving people

1402
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:29,340
forward because we don't have
time to mourn right now. And,

1403
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:31,410
and so immediately I set a
perimeter with the tanks.

1404
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:34,500
I established which vehicles is going to
be the tow vehicle for our down vehicle,

1405
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:36,540
where the casualties going to go.
Where's the corpsman?

1406
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,050
And I get out of my vehicle
and I pushed it to leaders.

1407
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:41,460
Do we go to the point of friction?
Where's the point of friction?

1408
01:21:41,460 --> 01:21:45,870
And that was my vehicle was just hit with
a suicide vehicle. Man, I'd get there.

1409
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,190
And on top of it is this 22 year old kid,

1410
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:54,900
Jeff Lampson was built like
a number two pencil, right?

1411
01:21:56,370 --> 01:22:00,600
He was just in this vehicle.
I mean this vehicle is destroyed.

1412
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,580
How he's conscious,
I don't know,

1413
01:22:02,581 --> 01:22:06,120
but he's on top of it pulling our gunner
out of the turret who's got a piece of

1414
01:22:06,121 --> 01:22:08,580
shrapnel in his head
bigger than that book.

1415
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,340
Everybody in the vehicles,
everybody's wounded but staff,

1416
01:22:13,341 --> 01:22:16,140
certain Francis comes out in the whole
side of his face, his melt and he's like,

1417
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:18,000
sir, we're going to be
good. We're going to be,

1418
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:21,810
I was never more relieved in my life.
They're still getting shot at.

1419
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:24,750
Francis is basically walking but
he's not totally conscious yet.

1420
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:27,080
They're like bullets and I'm a guard.

1421
01:22:27,330 --> 01:22:30,150
Like I got to grab and put it behind the
vehicle for a second cause he's out of

1422
01:22:30,151 --> 01:22:30,984
it of course.

1423
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:36,600
But man to to see Lampson
this kid who actually,

1424
01:22:36,601 --> 01:22:37,200
you know,

1425
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,470
had a little bit of an attitude at the
time was one of the guys I had to correct

1426
01:22:40,471 --> 01:22:42,330
an awful lot.
Hair's a little too long.

1427
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:47,180
He tried to grow a mustache and peach
fuzz mean he's a kid. You look at the,

1428
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:51,210
I mean, you would never imagine that this
is a warrior, but in this time of need,

1429
01:22:51,211 --> 01:22:52,080
I'm telling you man,

1430
01:22:52,081 --> 01:22:57,081
he was saving lives and it was so
humbling and so motivating to see that.

1431
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:04,050
And we were able to, we got everybody
in that Mike 88 eventually got the toe,

1432
01:23:04,051 --> 01:23:07,960
got out of there and I mean called in a
massive air strike and, and, and we won.

1433
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,930
But we didn't pitch a shutout,
that's for sure. And in that,

1434
01:23:10,931 --> 01:23:15,490
the hardest part of that was when all
my casualties are loaded on, you have,

1435
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:17,530
we're not doctors,
we have no idea.

1436
01:23:17,530 --> 01:23:19,870
When you see a guy with shrapnel
out of his brain like that,

1437
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:21,940
you think they're done.
So my marines,

1438
01:23:21,941 --> 01:23:25,210
they think we may have lost two or
three of these folks and they're down.

1439
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:29,320
And as far as I know, we're out there
to fight for the three, four, five,

1440
01:23:29,321 --> 01:23:34,210
six that was gas, right? That was shrapnel
was head. Was He, was he walking wounded?

1441
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:37,690
Was He, so he would, he would come to,

1442
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:41,170
he got shot as Lampson was
pulling them out of the Turret.

1443
01:23:41,171 --> 01:23:44,620
He got shot again in the elbow
as we were pulling them out.

1444
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,680
And we got him to the medivac and, and
he was just, he was, I remember he was,

1445
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:49,930
he was cursing.
I can't believe I let them get us.

1446
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:52,480
I can't believe I let them get us
blaming himself for the suicide vehicle

1447
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:55,440
getting to the vehicle. And I told
him, it's not you, it's my fault.

1448
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,440
It's not your fault. And, uh, but
at least he was talking. Yeah.

1449
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:02,860
But I mean this, I, you know, this is,

1450
01:24:02,861 --> 01:24:06,130
this is pretty freaky when you see a
piece of metal in someone's head just like

1451
01:24:06,131 --> 01:24:09,310
this. And I don't, he couldn't see himself
and I had nobody wanted to tell him.

1452
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:13,690
Nobody wanted to say, hey, reach up and
touch within your brain right now. Um,

1453
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,390
but he was gone. I mean,
once he left that day,

1454
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:18,430
we didn't see him the rest of the
deployment. I didn't see him until,

1455
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:22,090
till I had gotten back.
And the craziest thing is

1456
01:24:26,130 --> 01:24:30,300
we reunited for an episode of
ultimate insider with the UFC.

1457
01:24:30,301 --> 01:24:34,830
And I didn't really know what they
were after. And this, this producer,

1458
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,030
you know, asked me if I could get this
guy there, you're going to do a story.

1459
01:24:39,031 --> 01:24:43,290
It was really going to be honorable to
him, this and that. And, and it was right.

1460
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:44,101
But at the same time,

1461
01:24:44,101 --> 01:24:46,440
he sit in this next to each other
and he's asking this marine, hey,

1462
01:24:46,441 --> 01:24:50,940
do you blame Brian Stann
for this happening? Do you
blame this for him? I mean,

1463
01:24:50,941 --> 01:24:53,730
it was, it was, it was dark and
it was difficult. And it was,

1464
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:57,390
it was hard for both of us, man,
because, you know, for gas, it,

1465
01:24:57,630 --> 01:25:01,200
he lived right in and he's got a family
now, but that the amount of headaches,

1466
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:05,250
the piercing headaches, this
man's struggles with, you
know, in and out of Comms,

1467
01:25:05,251 --> 01:25:09,090
try and text him. I don't know what,
you know, we're, we're numbers at, um,

1468
01:25:09,870 --> 01:25:14,790
he's a great warrior, great dude.
But the pain he lives with every day,

1469
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:16,800
I mean, at the, this is never
going away. He had I think,

1470
01:25:16,801 --> 01:25:20,550
four brain surgeries after
that four brain surgeries,

1471
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:23,280
unbelievable and he was blaming himself

1472
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:26,490
crazy or yours.

1473
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:31,500
Then you know you,
you kind of wrap up that here.

1474
01:25:32,910 --> 01:25:34,110
Going back to the book,

1475
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:38,700
our unit three two marines
is known as the BTO bastards.

1476
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:44,420
In 1943 the battalion took
part in operation galvanic
the invasion of Tarawa Btu

1477
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:50,550
island was the main target of the landing
force and the marines faced and the

1478
01:25:50,551 --> 01:25:55,551
entrenched enemy with preregistered
fields of fire on the beaches close.

1479
01:25:55,921 --> 01:25:56,850
Either don't know what that is.

1480
01:25:56,851 --> 01:26:01,851
That's an actual nightmare when the enemy
already knows where their rounds are

1481
01:26:03,171 --> 01:26:06,680
going to land, when they fire them
because it's a worst case scenario.

1482
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:10,590
The first assault waves were nearly
wiped out by machine gun and mortar fires

1483
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:13,010
and they waited through the
lagoon onto the narrow beach.

1484
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,890
It took 76 hours to kick clear the island,

1485
01:26:16,610 --> 01:26:20,180
which was barely 2000 yards
long and a few score wide.

1486
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:25,610
Over 3000 marines and sailors died or
fell wounded during what became the most

1487
01:26:25,611 --> 01:26:29,000
ferocious close quarter battle ever
fought by the United States Marine Corps.

1488
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:34,790
That was the legacy of my unit,
a legacy of determination,

1489
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:39,920
heroism, and stoic resolve in the
face of unimaginable adversity.

1490
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,770
On May 10th,

1491
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:47,270
2008 my marines proved they
were cut from the same cloth.

1492
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:51,293
Indeed,

1493
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:57,080
it's so humbling when you watched these
young men from all different walks of

1494
01:26:57,361 --> 01:26:58,610
life,
you know,

1495
01:26:58,620 --> 01:27:02,160
some of them only citizens in the United
States for a couple of years at that

1496
01:27:02,161 --> 01:27:06,750
point. Really diverse backgrounds and
me, it's not a gang full of white people.

1497
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:11,520
I mean it's, it's very diverse.
I mean, they don't care. And Man,

1498
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:17,220
when they're getting shot at,
there was nobody ducking for cover.

1499
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:21,330
Nobody.
They are getting after their,

1500
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:24,690
their love and care for one another,
for the mission,

1501
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:27,270
for people trying to destroy
their way of life. It's,

1502
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:32,260
it's all inspiring to watch their selfless
acts. I mean, what they'll do and, and,

1503
01:27:32,270 --> 01:27:37,270
and this was more obviously direct
engagement against an enemy,

1504
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,590
right? But, but there's,
I've seen them, you know,

1505
01:27:40,591 --> 01:27:45,240
just like Lampson was willing to sacrifice
himself to save Robert Gas. Right.

1506
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:50,750
I've seen marines do the same to save
innocent Iraqi kids the same care that

1507
01:27:52,591 --> 01:27:57,360
they had for one another they had for the
people that they were there to protect.

1508
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,340
And that gets lost a lot when
people talk about these wars. It's,

1509
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:04,770
it's become cool to paint
our military like we're,

1510
01:28:04,771 --> 01:28:08,610
we're this brutal force that's wiped out.
You know,

1511
01:28:08,611 --> 01:28:12,690
all these people in these different
countries. I mean these, these were men,

1512
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,780
these were men who were
such great professionals,

1513
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:21,080
but under the most extreme circumstances
understood that they could lose their

1514
01:28:22,261 --> 01:28:25,710
life and that was a hundred
percent acceptable to them.

1515
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:28,080
If that meant saving
the guy next to him and,

1516
01:28:28,190 --> 01:28:33,190
and that it's hard for me to meet somebody
like Michael stray hand or a football

1517
01:28:34,621 --> 01:28:36,900
player, famous person, right?
They're all impressive people.

1518
01:28:36,901 --> 01:28:40,230
But it's hard for me to meet someone
like that and be like, oh my God,

1519
01:28:40,231 --> 01:28:42,520
can I get a picture for Instagram when,

1520
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:47,900
when you've been around 19 2120 year
old kids and these kids don't come from

1521
01:28:49,141 --> 01:28:52,320
rich background, right? They
didn't have a whole lot.

1522
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:56,700
There is a reason when the,
when our nation was in two wars,

1523
01:28:56,701 --> 01:29:00,990
they decided to sign up and be
infantry in the marine corps. It was,

1524
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:02,130
it,
they,

1525
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,400
they,

1526
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,880
they will forever be that the greatest
people I've ever been surrounded with.

1527
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:10,350
Yeah. You know, uh, I talk
about that all the time.

1528
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:16,050
The fact that when we were in Ramadi
specifically, you know, here we were,

1529
01:29:16,260 --> 01:29:21,180
the special operations guys,
the Navy Seals, whatever,

1530
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:24,720
we, all of us, all of us guys,

1531
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:29,840
we just had such admiration and love
for the Marine Corps and for the army

1532
01:29:34,051 --> 01:29:37,770
soldiers that we work with. Those
guys like you said, and, and for us,

1533
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:41,880
we're sitting there, we're
going, man, we've got, we
got infinitely more training,

1534
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:46,530
infinitely more training then a grunt
pass. That's just the way it is.

1535
01:29:46,700 --> 01:29:48,000
Like you talk about the budget,

1536
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:52,020
we used to shoot more rounds in a week,

1537
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:55,740
then our Marine Corps
company, we're shooting their
workup. No kidding. Like we,

1538
01:29:55,741 --> 01:30:00,540
I saw the numbers. So we get infinitely
more training, we get better gear.

1539
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:06,350
And yet you go down to the government
center and Ramadi or you go down to cop

1540
01:30:07,351 --> 01:30:08,184
Falcon.

1541
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:13,280
And you look at those soldiers and marines
that are getting after it every day.

1542
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,940
And that's why we just had nothing but
the utmost highest respect for those guys.

1543
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:21,960
And they knew it and that was some nasty
fighting down there to NASA funding in

1544
01:30:21,961 --> 01:30:23,760
Ramadi.
Yeah.

1545
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,460
I'm going to take us
back to the book here.

1546
01:30:30,530 --> 01:30:31,230
Okay.

1547
01:30:31,230 --> 01:30:34,110
An Amtrak,
a lightly armored amphibious vehicle.

1548
01:30:34,111 --> 01:30:38,190
First platoon three to five
struck a landmine only a
few hundred meters from our

1549
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:41,790
position. So this is another
operation that you're out on.

1550
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:46,500
And this is where we started this
a day off. We heard the explosion,

1551
01:30:46,501 --> 01:30:50,160
saw the smoke and flames rising behind
us and then heard the cries for help over

1552
01:30:50,161 --> 01:30:50,994
the radio.

1553
01:30:52,460 --> 01:30:53,130
Okay.

1554
01:30:53,130 --> 01:30:54,480
We couldn't go to their aid.

1555
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:58,830
The bridge had not yet been cleared and
we were almost certain had been mined by

1556
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:03,240
the enemy. Besides, we couldn't leave
our blocking position without exposing,

1557
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:05,010
exposing the left flank.

1558
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,590
The track burned as three to fives.

1559
01:31:08,591 --> 01:31:11,410
Fellow Marines and my friend and mentor,

1560
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:16,120
Lieutenant Deanna from our weapons
company frantically tried to free the men

1561
01:31:16,121 --> 01:31:17,050
trapped inside.

1562
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:18,900
Yeah.

1563
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:23,900
Inside Alpha three I could see this
color drain from my men's faces.

1564
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:26,100
They look absolutely stricken.

1565
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:27,850
Okay.

1566
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:31,540
Then the tracks ready.
Ammunition began cooking off

1567
01:31:33,330 --> 01:31:36,840
with each debt nation.
I could see my men flinch.

1568
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:41,250
I ordered everyone to face south. I didn't
want my men to see what was unfolding.

1569
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:45,390
Hearing it over the radio was bad enough.

1570
01:31:48,350 --> 01:31:50,390
Five marines died inside the track.

1571
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:53,870
Everyone else inside suffered
wounds of varying degrees.

1572
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:57,890
The driver was pulled from the wreckage,
his face, bloody and missing teeth.

1573
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,540
The explosion had his head against
the vehicles front console.

1574
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:04,120
Another marine emerged
with his uniform on fire.

1575
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:08,900
Quick thinking men nearby got him on
the ground and put the flames out with a

1576
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:12,970
fire extinguisher vol.
My experiences in combat,

1577
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,010
this is the one that haunts me the most.

1578
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:20,190
The feeling of complete impotence in the
face of such a profound tragedy scarred

1579
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:23,320
us all that day

1580
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:27,321
it gave,

1581
01:32:27,321 --> 01:32:32,321
Diana had actually served in Lima three
25 it's a reserve unit out of Columbus,

1582
01:32:32,571 --> 01:32:37,010
Ohio before he became active
duty and then became an officer.

1583
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:41,210
He was an enlisted with three 25 and I
remember when when we were starting this

1584
01:32:41,211 --> 01:32:44,390
operation in three 25 came to our base,

1585
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:48,980
him bringing some of these, these guys,
hey man, I've been, he grew up with them.

1586
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:52,520
I mean these were his brothers
and now they were firefighters.

1587
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:56,950
They were police officers all brought
together for this mission man.

1588
01:32:58,010 --> 01:33:01,010
It was brutal. Absolutely brutal. And I,

1589
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:08,330
I remember hearing a story about this
woman from Columbus who they had lost to

1590
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,460
think of it. It was over 20 names
around 22 marines from Lima,

1591
01:33:11,461 --> 01:33:12,930
three 25 during that deployment.

1592
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:18,810
And she decided to paint these beautiful
murals murals of each one and they were

1593
01:33:18,811 --> 01:33:23,740
so nice at the Marine Corps Museum for
a while, put them right in their foyer,

1594
01:33:23,741 --> 01:33:26,880
right as soon as you walk into the
museum there they were and they were big.

1595
01:33:27,630 --> 01:33:32,630
And I remember hearing story and then
I was doing a shoot with the UFC in the

1596
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:36,750
Marine Corp when the Marine
Corps is advertising at the
UFC and part of the shoe

1597
01:33:36,751 --> 01:33:38,820
is going to be us as fighters.

1598
01:33:38,821 --> 01:33:41,490
And then with the Marines going to the
Marine Corps Museum. And I was kind of,

1599
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:42,990
you know,
both sides of the fence on that.

1600
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:47,700
And we walked in and they were there
and I didn't know, I didn't expect it.

1601
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:50,630
And it was really tough because
here I am, you know, I'm,

1602
01:33:50,631 --> 01:33:52,620
I'm around these marines and I'm around,
you know,

1603
01:33:52,621 --> 01:33:56,130
some of my buddies and Rashad Evans,
Forrest Griffin were there. And I mean,

1604
01:33:56,131 --> 01:34:00,310
as soon as I walked in, man, my
eyes filled up with tears, you know,

1605
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:04,170
being given the opportunity to meet
some of these men very briefly.

1606
01:34:04,171 --> 01:34:07,950
Then we set off and go. And because
of my relationship with Gabe, Diana,

1607
01:34:07,951 --> 01:34:11,550
who was my mentor at the time,
and knowing what he went through that day,

1608
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:16,110
childhood brothers of his and,
and, and him also being helpless,

1609
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:19,530
uh,
and nothing's fair in combat.

1610
01:34:20,010 --> 01:34:23,640
We know that nothing's fair and and
you don't have the choice. Again,

1611
01:34:23,641 --> 01:34:26,310
you don't have the choice
that gets cleared on that.

1612
01:34:26,311 --> 01:34:29,430
Fourth continues to push west so that
we can finish the mission of this

1613
01:34:29,431 --> 01:34:32,850
operation. We got to continue providing
our blocking position and that's it.

1614
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:37,220
If you lose focus, more of that's
going to happen. It's, it's,

1615
01:34:37,221 --> 01:34:41,730
it's a difficult thing to deal with,
but that's what we signed up to do that.

1616
01:34:41,731 --> 01:34:45,370
That's why we have an all volunteer force
and it's the greatest military forces

1617
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,440
world has ever seen and it's unfortunate,
but part of it is dying.

1618
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:53,550
We die in battle is that the innocent
people here that live in America don't,

1619
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:58,010
and it sucks and it's painful, but at
the end of the day we, we know when we

1620
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:00,470
sign up,
we know that that is a possibility.

1621
01:35:01,890 --> 01:35:02,723
Yeah,

1622
01:35:05,010 --> 01:35:09,510
it is. Indeed. Now you had

1623
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,850
nine guys wounded from your
platoon. Is that right? From that,

1624
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:19,860
from that whole deployment,
from that couple days. Okay.

1625
01:35:19,861 --> 01:35:22,470
Yeah. Here we go. Nine men in a
week. Your, I'll go to the book,

1626
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,620
but some of them were the reservists
tankers that weren't technically mine,

1627
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:30,210
but yeah, the loss of so many marines
under my command at eating away at me,

1628
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:32,970
almost to the point where I
suffered a crisis in confidence.

1629
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:36,450
Nine men and week of combat.
What had I done wrong?

1630
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,310
What have I done wrong?

1631
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:42,810
What lessons could I learn my mind
obsessed over those questions.

1632
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:48,360
Inside the coc,
I braced for the shit storm.

1633
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,630
Captain Ford Phillips, my
company commander, spotted me.

1634
01:35:51,631 --> 01:35:55,800
As I came through the door, he swiftly
took me aside. Here it comes. I thought,

1635
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:00,900
Brian, excellent job. You did
everything right out there. Thank you.

1636
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:03,630
My jaw almost fell open.

1637
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:06,960
Those were the last words
I had expected to here.

1638
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:10,980
I greatly admired captain Phillips
and had long since learned.

1639
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:12,750
He always meant what he said.

1640
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,830
His words were never designed
to make someone feel better.

1641
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:20,880
They were always designed to make a man,
a better officer,

1642
01:36:21,120 --> 01:36:22,950
and a better marine.
Always

1643
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:26,880
his words ease the pain
of the last seven days,

1644
01:36:26,881 --> 01:36:29,250
but did not erase the guilt
that I felt to this day.

1645
01:36:29,251 --> 01:36:33,630
I questioned the decisions I made that
night. That is the onus of command.

1646
01:36:33,631 --> 01:36:37,800
You always bear the responsibility for
those under you when they suffer wounds

1647
01:36:37,801 --> 01:36:38,940
or are killed by the enemy,

1648
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:43,320
it is impossible for an officer not to
second guessed himself and own part of

1649
01:36:43,321 --> 01:36:47,070
their suffering or deaths.
As leaders,

1650
01:36:47,190 --> 01:36:50,610
we understand control.
That is where we operate.

1651
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:55,680
Having it is comfort,
but combat and the enemy strips that away.

1652
01:36:55,681 --> 01:37:00,480
At times. Once the bullets fly and
the violent chaos of a firefight,

1653
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:03,030
rains control becomes an illusion.

1654
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,730
A platoon commander cannot determine
which enemy bullets we'll strike what

1655
01:37:07,731 --> 01:37:11,360
vehicles he cannot select. The moment
when an insurgent triggers an IED,

1656
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:14,210
he cannot dictate who
survives and who doesn't.

1657
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:21,020
All we can do is try and fight back to
try and demolish the chaos with enough

1658
01:37:21,021 --> 01:37:23,420
fire power that the
enemy dies or runs away.

1659
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:26,690
Almost everything else is
beyond the leaders control.

1660
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:28,440
Okay?

1661
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:32,250
Those limits of leadership were
never drilled into us at the academy.

1662
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,610
When I experienced it for the first
time during Operation Matador,

1663
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:39,420
I came gradually to understand
on an intellectual level,

1664
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:45,040
but in my heart I still wonder if I could
have done something else that might've

1665
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,500
saved my marines from harm.

1666
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:53,120
I still spend sleepless nights
replaying every moment in my head,

1667
01:37:53,121 --> 01:37:58,121
hoping men like gas and
Jonathan Loewe can forgive me

1668
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:06,990
all part of it. Matt and I, it's,
it's funny you read that passage.

1669
01:38:06,991 --> 01:38:11,400
I was up last night, same thing,
two 45 in the morning and, and,

1670
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:15,780
and replaying it and it,
it's not something I would say

1671
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:20,820
there's a negative aspect. People will
hear me say that and I'm like, Oh man,

1672
01:38:20,821 --> 01:38:24,000
that's bad. You know, post
traumatic stress or something. No,

1673
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:29,040
it's me being a human being who
cares and wonders and it's hard.

1674
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:33,840
It's never going to go away and
all always wonder that, you know,

1675
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:37,150
would it have been a better
decision to take a left turn in,

1676
01:38:37,151 --> 01:38:38,700
in abort the mission at that point?

1677
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:43,260
Should I have tried to get back to the
bridge or if I'd have gone three blocks

1678
01:38:43,261 --> 01:38:43,411
up,

1679
01:38:43,411 --> 01:38:46,560
maybe there would have been a path we
could have found and put her head lights

1680
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:50,910
on.
There are so many what ifs,

1681
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:55,020
so many what ifs that you go
through as leaders. And if,

1682
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:00,200
if you try to ignore those times where
you spend those sleepless nights and not

1683
01:39:01,771 --> 01:39:03,240
think through that to get makes it worse.

1684
01:39:03,241 --> 01:39:05,970
I think the fact that I'll go
through the drill like last night,

1685
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:09,630
which is the first time in a long time
that I did. Um, I think part of it,

1686
01:39:09,631 --> 01:39:11,520
cause I knew we,
we'd probably be talking about it.

1687
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,800
I think it's healthy to do that for
me at least it has been, you know,

1688
01:39:16,801 --> 01:39:20,140
it's healthy for me to replay that and
to understand. And, and you know you,

1689
01:39:20,141 --> 01:39:23,070
you talked about that moment with my
company commander at Fort Phillips.

1690
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:25,560
I remember that conversation.

1691
01:39:26,130 --> 01:39:28,380
And I remember kind of going back at
him a little bit and saying, you know,

1692
01:39:28,381 --> 01:39:32,010
I just think if I would've done this
or done that, and he stopped me.

1693
01:39:33,180 --> 01:39:36,150
Brian, listen, you did everything right.

1694
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:39,600
You did everything that you could
do out there. And it was, you know,

1695
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:43,170
it was definitely what I needed to hear
because we still had a long way to go in

1696
01:39:43,171 --> 01:39:46,350
that deployment and I still had
to go do another one. It was,

1697
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:50,070
it was great leadership on
his part because it gave me,

1698
01:39:50,071 --> 01:39:53,440
there was no more second guessing
at that point, you know, because it,

1699
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:58,080
that was not the time to sit there and
start to question my decision and my

1700
01:39:58,081 --> 01:40:01,410
instincts in battle that it served
me. Well. Up until that point,

1701
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:07,480
I had a, um, a similar conversation
as a matter of fact with leaf. So,

1702
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:10,450
you know, when, when mark we got killed,

1703
01:40:10,810 --> 01:40:15,040
it was a Ryan job who
ended up dying as well,

1704
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:20,041
but he had been severely wounded and Lafe
was down in a combat outpost with his

1705
01:40:20,711 --> 01:40:21,544
platoon.

1706
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:26,850
And we got Ryan job had been Kaz evaced
out and now the guys are down at this

1707
01:40:27,911 --> 01:40:32,600
combat outpost and the army who
are the one, three, seven, um,

1708
01:40:32,740 --> 01:40:37,720
bulldogs Bravo company,
who we had an amazing relationship with.

1709
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,820
Captain Mike Bama main gun.
Mike,

1710
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:45,060
they were out trying to try to get after
it and they got to a point where he

1711
01:40:45,061 --> 01:40:49,060
said, hey, we think we know where
these guys are that shot. Ryan,

1712
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:52,000
do you, can you guys help us? I mean,

1713
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:57,030
it was like the day of fighting
and Lafe called me up on the,

1714
01:40:57,341 --> 01:41:01,360
on the radio and says, Hey,
w w w I want to go back out.

1715
01:41:01,390 --> 01:41:05,260
They think they know where these guys are.
I want to go back out. And I was like,

1716
01:41:05,350 --> 01:41:07,030
go,
go get some.

1717
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:10,420
And he went out and you know,

1718
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:14,770
they were under heavy fire and that's
what mark got killed. And you know,

1719
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:18,580
leaf was, you know, he, he was, you know,

1720
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:23,170
the mission gets done and all that. But
next day leaf comes to me and he says, um,

1721
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:28,660
you know, hey, hey Jocko,
him, you know, he was tore up,
you know, he was tore up his,

1722
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:31,240
his, his friend, his
brother was, was dead.

1723
01:41:31,241 --> 01:41:33,940
His other friend was severely wounded.

1724
01:41:33,941 --> 01:41:36,580
But what really got to him
was mark because you know,

1725
01:41:36,581 --> 01:41:40,240
he'd made this decision to go back
out and he said to me, you know,

1726
01:41:40,241 --> 01:41:44,110
I just don't know if I you,
I don't know if I made the right decision.

1727
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:47,380
And I said to, I said to him, [inaudible]

1728
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:52,030
there was no decision to make.

1729
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:57,870
There was Americans out there fighting
in the streets trying to get after these

1730
01:41:57,871 --> 01:42:01,590
guys that had wounded one of your guys,
one of our guys,

1731
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:06,120
and they thought they knew where he was
and they thought you could go and get

1732
01:42:06,121 --> 01:42:09,550
them.
There's no decision to make.

1733
01:42:09,551 --> 01:42:11,470
You don't have to have a
choice in that situation.

1734
01:42:11,740 --> 01:42:16,570
You do what you do as an
American, as a seal, as a frogman.

1735
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:21,910
There was no decision.
You did what we do.

1736
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:40,330
And I think that's
something that any leader,

1737
01:42:41,350 --> 01:42:44,890
when you get your young leaders out there,
no,

1738
01:42:44,891 --> 01:42:48,940
obviously if they screw something up,
obviously that's a different story.

1739
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:50,560
But you know,

1740
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:52,900
we don't have the luxury of knowing
what's going to happen in to combat

1741
01:42:52,901 --> 01:42:56,680
situation. There's no crystal
ball. There's no do you don't know.

1742
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:59,380
Like what you just said,
guys would say that stuff to me sometimes.

1743
01:42:59,381 --> 01:43:03,490
Like you could've gone left or right. Oh
really? Cause if you could've gone left,

1744
01:43:03,491 --> 01:43:06,490
like you just talked about and he had
a giant ID and now everyone's dead,

1745
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:10,330
you could've gone straight and you
could have gotten clear. You don't know.

1746
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,130
You don't have that luxury in combat.

1747
01:43:12,220 --> 01:43:15,490
You're making decisions based on the
information that you have at that time.

1748
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:20,050
You don't know all this other shit yet.
If you knew it. Obviously looking back,

1749
01:43:20,051 --> 01:43:23,830
hindsight is 2020 we wouldn't have
even gone there in the first place.

1750
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,480
But we don't know that. The only
way to avoid any risk is not to go,

1751
01:43:28,540 --> 01:43:32,350
is not to do your job is to
just go ahead and stand up,

1752
01:43:32,351 --> 01:43:36,730
raise your hand and say I'm a coward.
That's how you can avoid these situations.

1753
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:39,353
But

1754
01:43:39,710 --> 01:43:41,480
guys in the Marine Corp
guys in the seal teams,

1755
01:43:41,481 --> 01:43:43,820
they don't raise their hand and say
that they raised their hand and say,

1756
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:46,490
where's the bad guys?
We're going to get them.

1757
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:48,930
Okay.

1758
01:43:48,930 --> 01:43:52,040
And one of the mistakes you can make too,
is sometimes you want

1759
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,420
to stop,
you want to think about it.

1760
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:56,660
Sometimes there is no
right answer right there.

1761
01:43:56,661 --> 01:43:58,070
There's a bunch of things you can do.

1762
01:43:58,071 --> 01:44:02,420
There's a bunch of options and whatever
one you take and maintain tempo and

1763
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:05,840
achieved tempo and stay a step
ahead of the enemy is the right one.

1764
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:09,410
It's how you execute it. Yeah.
Either way you could be going into,

1765
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:13,370
into a bad day, but you better do
it your way in on your terms. Yeah.

1766
01:44:13,430 --> 01:44:16,580
One thing that's guaranteed to turn into
a bad day is sitting there and not do

1767
01:44:16,581 --> 01:44:17,990
nothing happens.
Because I'll tell you what,

1768
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:20,280
if you're not maneuvering the
enemy's maneuvers, we are.

1769
01:44:20,340 --> 01:44:22,730
If you're not maneuvering the
enemy's absolutely maneuvering.

1770
01:44:22,731 --> 01:44:25,160
They're getting their flanking you,
they're getting a high ground,

1771
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:28,910
they're doing something. So you better
just be inaction, taking action,

1772
01:44:29,060 --> 01:44:33,110
make a decision and go. Especially on
their turf, their tour, their cities,

1773
01:44:33,111 --> 01:44:36,710
their neighborhoods. They know
every corner, we're guessing.

1774
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:38,863
Yeah.

1775
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:43,760
So now you come back, you, you, um,

1776
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:48,850
I'm fast forwarding to where
you're now becoming a company XL.

1777
01:44:49,671 --> 01:44:50,211
I'm going to the book.

1778
01:44:50,211 --> 01:44:53,790
Just after we deployed again in 2006 I
was pulled from weapons company to become

1779
01:44:53,791 --> 01:44:57,030
an executive officer for India company.
Three two marines. It happened so fast.

1780
01:44:57,031 --> 01:45:00,230
I didn't have time to get know my new
marines before we ended up in country

1781
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:00,890
again.

1782
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:05,720
We deployed to Al Anbar
province to a fob near Haba Nia,

1783
01:45:06,200 --> 01:45:09,560
and this was cool because you are in
Habbaniyah and I was 20 miles away in

1784
01:45:09,561 --> 01:45:11,630
Ramadi and in that summer of 2006

1785
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,830
yeah,

1786
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:16,200
next,
my company last four Marines killed.

1787
01:45:17,330 --> 01:45:17,690
Okay.

1788
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:20,090
Lance Corporal Don Champ
Champlin was our first.

1789
01:45:20,091 --> 01:45:24,110
He was killed by a roadside bomb on
the main road running through our area.

1790
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:28,190
That was the end of August of 2006 a
month later on the 24th our company

1791
01:45:28,191 --> 01:45:31,940
commander sent a platoon out after an
insurgent who'd fired a rocket into one of

1792
01:45:31,941 --> 01:45:32,900
our patrol basis.

1793
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:36,830
They'd gone out without a special
device that blocked incoming cell phone

1794
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:41,450
signals and prevented in surgeons from
remotely detonating Ids. Sure enough,

1795
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:43,430
the platoon got hit with a bomb.

1796
01:45:44,360 --> 01:45:44,770
Okay.

1797
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:48,760
Blue Lance Corporal Renee Martinez,
70 meters into the air.

1798
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:52,920
He died instantly.
That one really hurt.

1799
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:57,600
I'd been on the base at the time. I took
great pride in going out on patrols,

1800
01:45:57,690 --> 01:45:59,850
not to ride herd on
the platoon commanders,

1801
01:45:59,970 --> 01:46:04,770
but to be there as an additional asset
and to share the risks with my marines.

1802
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:06,600
Okay.

1803
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:09,660
This time I'd been tied up and
couldn't get out there with the men.

1804
01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:10,340
Yeah.

1805
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:13,040
When I heard what was happening,
I grabbed a Humvee and race to the scene.

1806
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:18,620
We carried Renee back to the
morgue inside. I stood next to him,

1807
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,800
held his hand and said my goodbyes.

1808
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:23,560
Okay.

1809
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,470
I will carry the guilt of that
day for the rest of my life.

1810
01:46:27,620 --> 01:46:28,210
Okay.

1811
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:29,950
I should have been out
there with that platoon.

1812
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:39,390
We kept taking casualties that fall.

1813
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:43,510
Even units just passing through
our area got hit. One EOD,

1814
01:46:43,511 --> 01:46:46,540
Rick got hit with a roadside bomb build.

1815
01:46:46,541 --> 01:46:48,820
The blast didn't destroy the
armored Humvee. It set off a

1816
01:46:50,460 --> 01:46:53,160
phosphorus based incendiary
grenade grenades.

1817
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:56,190
The EOD team had left on
the floor of their rig

1818
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:59,220
before we can even get to them.

1819
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:02,430
The white hot chemical fired
melted them where they sat.

1820
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:08,610
The site was indescribable.
After that scene,

1821
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:13,710
morale in the company plummeted.
The men question the mission.

1822
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,610
What was the point?
We were getting shot at almost every day.

1823
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:22,350
Going into he had a patrol was a daily
nightmare of snipers, bombs and bushes.

1824
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,570
Half the time we couldn't even fire back.

1825
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:28,050
The rules of engagement were so strict
that if civilians were in the area,

1826
01:47:28,170 --> 01:47:29,580
we could not engage the enemy.

1827
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:32,310
Since there were almost
always civilians in the area,

1828
01:47:32,311 --> 01:47:36,000
our marines had to show
incredible restraint even as
they watched their brothers

1829
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:36,834
die.

1830
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:38,990
Okay,

1831
01:47:38,990 --> 01:47:42,350
so you guys were wrapped
that Roe Roe was tight.

1832
01:47:42,490 --> 01:47:47,140
It was tough. I mean it was how many,
it had never been patrolled before.

1833
01:47:47,710 --> 01:47:49,300
They had set up patrol basis,

1834
01:47:49,301 --> 01:47:52,080
but they had never gone out and
walked around in in it. You know, the,

1835
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:55,360
the outgoing unit said, you don't want
to do that. You don't want to do that,

1836
01:47:56,350 --> 01:47:58,240
but you had to.
The only way,

1837
01:47:58,241 --> 01:48:02,200
the only way to defeat that enemy was
to suffocate the area and what mattered.

1838
01:48:02,201 --> 01:48:05,920
Most of the people, if the people trusted
us, they would feed us the information.

1839
01:48:05,921 --> 01:48:09,370
So we get captured the enemy if that
people trusted them because we wouldn't

1840
01:48:09,371 --> 01:48:12,940
patrol and we were scared, then they
would trust them and we would end up,

1841
01:48:12,970 --> 01:48:16,930
we would end up not accomplishing our
mission. And it was, it was so hard.

1842
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:24,010
You know, people have this idea that
because you were a certain rank,

1843
01:48:24,011 --> 01:48:28,570
everybody's going to listen or to hardcore
leadership and in they're not going

1844
01:48:28,571 --> 01:48:29,710
to ask questions.
You know,

1845
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:33,310
when I would go patrol base to patrol
base and speak to my men and they would

1846
01:48:33,311 --> 01:48:37,510
ask, why, why should I
walk out there tomorrow?

1847
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:41,510
You know,
we don't have CNN and,

1848
01:48:41,511 --> 01:48:45,640
and this general or the president talking
to us, given us this big huge, hey,

1849
01:48:45,790 --> 01:48:49,390
here's the ultimate game plan over.
We don't get any of that. I mean,

1850
01:48:49,420 --> 01:48:53,620
my guys were showering once
every 1718 days. That's it.

1851
01:48:53,621 --> 01:48:57,580
We were living amongst the populous
amongst the enemy that was traveling all

1852
01:48:57,581 --> 01:49:01,630
around the country, coming in
and, and, and, and attacking us.

1853
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,850
And so it got really difficult.

1854
01:49:03,851 --> 01:49:07,270
But the one thing that that stuck with
them that they could understand that at

1855
01:49:07,271 --> 01:49:11,590
their perspective they got was,
hey, look, if you quit on me,

1856
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:16,360
that's one less guy to man the post on
top of this patrol base to keep this

1857
01:49:16,361 --> 01:49:19,990
roadway clear.
It's one less guy garden Mikey's flank.

1858
01:49:19,991 --> 01:49:22,360
When you go on patrol and you
got three patrols tomorrow,

1859
01:49:23,350 --> 01:49:27,220
we were already so thin at that time.

1860
01:49:27,250 --> 01:49:31,720
Our battlespace was way too big
for us to truly suffocate it,

1861
01:49:31,721 --> 01:49:33,370
to make sure the enemy couldn't,

1862
01:49:33,820 --> 01:49:37,300
couldn't come in and
influence way too big,

1863
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:40,690
but as we got better,

1864
01:49:41,560 --> 01:49:46,510
as we secured the area and we focused
really on the main supply route and the

1865
01:49:46,511 --> 01:49:49,360
economic of that, the
shops, if we get you secure,

1866
01:49:49,361 --> 01:49:53,320
the shops insecure the schools because
the kids couldn't go to school and the

1867
01:49:53,321 --> 01:49:56,170
kid tried to go to school.
I'll kind of killed the teachers.

1868
01:49:57,250 --> 01:50:00,940
So now we secured the area enough
that the two schools could open.

1869
01:50:00,941 --> 01:50:02,140
When we were able to do that,

1870
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,710
then the shops opened up and the people
could start living their lives again.

1871
01:50:05,711 --> 01:50:09,700
That was one of the proudest days of my
marines lives when those kids could walk

1872
01:50:09,701 --> 01:50:10,534
to school again,

1873
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:15,340
these schools were corners blown
up from iads bullet holes in him.

1874
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:18,340
There were no roofs. I mean they
were by our standards in America,

1875
01:50:18,341 --> 01:50:20,470
you wouldn't be able to
fathom what these look like.

1876
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:24,130
They were basically concrete squares with,

1877
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:26,020
with really bad desks in them.

1878
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,690
The school supplies they had
were given to him from us.

1879
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,230
And so that was a huge win for us.

1880
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:37,231
And at that time was right around the
same time of the search when the surge

1881
01:50:37,511 --> 01:50:38,051
took place.

1882
01:50:38,051 --> 01:50:43,051
What happened was two Iraqi companies
pushed west and we're able to take up a

1883
01:50:43,600 --> 01:50:48,250
quarter of our battlespace,
which then greatly allowed us now.

1884
01:50:48,251 --> 01:50:52,130
Now we've got enough people.
Now we can really influence it.

1885
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:55,840
What happened with the Iraqi people who
you would sit down and have dinner with

1886
01:50:55,841 --> 01:50:57,490
them and bring them gifts and talk to him?

1887
01:50:57,730 --> 01:51:00,730
I'd have meetings with them at two in
the morning when they felt comfortable to

1888
01:51:00,731 --> 01:51:04,960
speak to me. Now they're telling
me who, where, what time,

1889
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:09,580
where can we get them? And when you've
got marines question the mission,

1890
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:12,490
then all of a sudden you deliver them
some intelligence hae at 3:00 AM you're

1891
01:51:12,491 --> 01:51:15,820
going to go find this person at this spot.
This is what they look like,

1892
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:19,180
this what they're called, get
them. Then they get excited,

1893
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:21,730
and I don't mean get him is in terms of,
hey,

1894
01:51:21,731 --> 01:51:25,450
they're going to go and they're
going to go kill that person.

1895
01:51:25,480 --> 01:51:28,150
They're going to go capture them.
And we had a whole process.

1896
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:32,590
That whole very frustrating do
you had to literally now, now my,

1897
01:51:32,591 --> 01:51:35,680
my regional longer instrument. Now
they're also detectives. All right,

1898
01:51:35,681 --> 01:51:38,470
so this is the Intel package
that led to this detention.

1899
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:40,190
Here's the paperwork for the detention,

1900
01:51:40,191 --> 01:51:42,010
and we delivered them
to the detention center.

1901
01:51:42,190 --> 01:51:43,630
If you don't hit every wicked right,

1902
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:45,580
that person's back on the
streets and three days.

1903
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:50,020
So that was also detailed discipline
and doing all the right things.

1904
01:51:50,021 --> 01:51:53,500
But they did it. And I
tell Ya, Ramadi, Hibernia,

1905
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:58,680
they were some of the worst areas
in Iraq that fall by Christmas time.

1906
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:04,270
It was amazing. The turnaround
was incredible. They were
quiet. They were quiet.

1907
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:07,240
It was, it was, you know,

1908
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:09,900
I left the,
I left October 21st,

1909
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:13,560
2006 there was 30 to 50 enemy attacks a
day while I was in deployment that six

1910
01:52:13,561 --> 01:52:14,250
months,

1911
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:19,250
by January there was like one or two
enemy attacks a day down from 30 to 50.

1912
01:52:21,210 --> 01:52:25,090
It was boom. It was
incredible, incredible and blog

1913
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:27,650
than February,
February of 2007

1914
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:30,650
in it,

1915
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,160
beacon to common home,
third battalion,

1916
01:52:34,161 --> 01:52:38,210
second marines came home in 2007
after suffering 15 killed in action.

1917
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:43,850
It could have been far worse for all
of us if we hadn't seen any progress in

1918
01:52:43,851 --> 01:52:44,221
hominy.

1919
01:52:44,221 --> 01:52:47,300
And that's what you're talking then all
those questions we had over the mission

1920
01:52:47,301 --> 01:52:50,960
and its value would have returned home
to term torment us for years to come.

1921
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:52,160
In fact,

1922
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:57,160
we did see progress and that made
it a little easier to accept things.

1923
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,703
And um,

1924
01:53:02,030 --> 01:53:06,160
yeah, that's, that's basically what
you just said and that's why, you know,

1925
01:53:06,170 --> 01:53:08,750
you and I were talking about
this on the way over as,

1926
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:11,720
as nice as it was that we
got to see that happen.

1927
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:16,870
There was nothing more sickening to me
than to have eight years later have the,

1928
01:53:18,830 --> 01:53:23,180
the black flag of isis flying over the
city of Ramadi at the government center.

1929
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:27,530
That debt, it was just absolutely heinous
to see that it didn't need to happen.

1930
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,233
And

1931
01:53:30,490 --> 01:53:31,240
okay.

1932
01:53:31,240 --> 01:53:31,600
You know,

1933
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:35,530
they actually took Ramadi back again
through massive air strike and I was

1934
01:53:35,531 --> 01:53:38,830
talking to one of my buddies that was
a j Tac that's actually coming on the

1935
01:53:38,831 --> 01:53:43,330
podcast Marine Corps, Jay Tac then I was
talking to you about earlier, but he's,

1936
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:47,890
I was like, how many bombs did we
drop in Ramadi while we were there?

1937
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:49,840
Because it was a populous city.

1938
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:53,380
There was normal Iraqis that want to live
their lives. We weren't dropping moms.

1939
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:55,180
He was like, I don't know, maybe a dozen,

1940
01:53:55,181 --> 01:54:00,181
15 in the second portion to Ramadi that
the Iraqis just did behind the strength

1941
01:54:01,061 --> 01:54:04,360
of American firepower.
You know how many air missions they did?

1942
01:54:04,510 --> 01:54:07,480
They did 600 strike missions.

1943
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:12,040
And you've seen pictures of
Ramadi right now it's rubble now.

1944
01:54:12,041 --> 01:54:16,990
They're rebuilding it now, but it
was just, just, just rubble and um,

1945
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:21,830
yeah, just, it's so disheartening. Um,

1946
01:54:23,350 --> 01:54:28,350
so you come home from that deployment
and pretty quickly after you got,

1947
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,970
you got home that Travis got
killed. Yeah. And, uh, you know,

1948
01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:36,280
I wanted to give a little credit here
to the Mitt teams because Travis was a

1949
01:54:36,281 --> 01:54:41,260
Mitt team, uh, which is military
transition team, which was, okay.

1950
01:54:41,261 --> 01:54:45,520
So I talk about this sometimes, right? So
the seals and a special operations guys,

1951
01:54:45,521 --> 01:54:49,810
a lot of times we live in
relative comfort. Okay.

1952
01:54:49,811 --> 01:54:52,570
So we live like, okay, we're pretty
comfortable. You know, like I said,

1953
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:57,130
I had Max on deployment,
I brought a GP medium tent to put massive,

1954
01:54:57,510 --> 01:55:00,940
cause I got to train some Jujitsu.
We have a nice weight room, you know,

1955
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:04,990
wheat and seals are super aggressive
and crafty and figuring out like, okay,

1956
01:55:05,110 --> 01:55:08,590
what can we do? How can we get this?
We'll Barb contractors and ordering stuff.

1957
01:55:08,591 --> 01:55:12,430
And so we just make, we do a good
job of building our infrastructure.

1958
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:15,910
And when I say infrastructure, I mean
some, some comforts come with that.

1959
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:17,830
Right now you go to the conventionals,

1960
01:55:17,910 --> 01:55:20,680
take a step down because they're
not getting as much leeway.

1961
01:55:20,681 --> 01:55:23,380
They don't have as much. Uh,
they can't get away with as much,

1962
01:55:23,381 --> 01:55:28,090
so they're living maybe a little bit
harder, maybe even a lot harder then.

1963
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:29,800
And of course a,
by the way,

1964
01:55:30,010 --> 01:55:32,560
there's special operations guys that
are living out in the sticks and

1965
01:55:32,561 --> 01:55:37,480
Afghanistan with two of them with, you
know, 280 tribesmen. So I'm, I'm saying,

1966
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:39,040
I'm talking about my particular situation,

1967
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:42,850
which my particular situation was in Iraq
when I deployed there. We always lived,

1968
01:55:43,410 --> 01:55:47,670
always lived good conventionals
we'd go out to their outstations,

1969
01:55:47,671 --> 01:55:50,310
we'd stopped on a way to a mission.
We'd stopped by someone, you know,

1970
01:55:50,311 --> 01:55:53,970
stop by wherever, some cops
somewhere or some fobs somewhere.

1971
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:56,340
Those guys are living rough.
And I had seals,

1972
01:55:56,341 --> 01:55:58,380
my seals that lived in Craig
it or they were living rough.

1973
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:04,820
But my point is you go one step further
and now you get to what called the Mitt

1974
01:56:04,861 --> 01:56:09,480
team. And the mid teams are
embedded with Iraqi troops.

1975
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:13,380
And so they are living with Iraqi
troops. There might be two, three,

1976
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:18,150
maybe four of them. And they're out
there living with the Iraqi troops,

1977
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:22,290
counting on the security of the
Iraqi forces to protect them.

1978
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:25,680
And I mean it was horrible. When we
first got to Ramadi, there was a,

1979
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:30,710
there was a VB IED attack that killed
the oncoming Mitt team commander and the

1980
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,770
outgoing Mitt team commander,

1981
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:38,940
they're doing a turnover at
a station and a Vb IED came,

1982
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:40,860
killed them both wounded a bunch.

1983
01:56:40,861 --> 01:56:45,690
But it's interesting cause I didn't
know Travis was a supply officer in the

1984
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:48,000
Marine Corps. And so, so the,

1985
01:56:48,130 --> 01:56:50,940
the Marine Corps has this
way of selecting where you,

1986
01:56:50,970 --> 01:56:53,400
where you get what you get to be
in the Marine Corps as an officer.

1987
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:55,770
They take the class and chunk
it up into thirds and then the,

1988
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:59,940
the each top third you get a
pick and it goes down the list.

1989
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,840
So that way they don't have every
single guy, eh, all the best guys,

1990
01:57:03,841 --> 01:57:06,570
quote unquote going to be Marine Corps
and three are going to be a pilot.

1991
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:09,180
You might be,
you might be the bottom,

1992
01:57:09,300 --> 01:57:13,800
the top of the bottom third in the class
and you get your pick. So you don't,

1993
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:15,960
it doesn't matter how you perform.
I mean it matters.

1994
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:20,961
But out of a class of over 200 Travis
was 17 in his class at the basic school,

1995
01:57:21,271 --> 01:57:23,730
which is a very prestigious,

1996
01:57:23,731 --> 01:57:26,130
they'd be due to graduate
in the top 25 is incredible.

1997
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:30,000
And he got his third choice
is 30 is a logistics officer.

1998
01:57:30,001 --> 01:57:32,940
He was furious.
So he's angry.

1999
01:57:33,600 --> 01:57:37,590
And then the, and the Marine
Corps did this very, very well.

2000
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,460
They understood the
importance of the Mitt team.

2001
01:57:39,461 --> 01:57:44,461
So they really took great guys and
send him to the Mitt teams and he,

2002
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,580
so they put up volunteers, hey, who wants,

2003
01:57:47,700 --> 01:57:52,700
who wants to raise your hand and go live
amongst the Iraqi's counting on them

2004
01:57:53,071 --> 01:57:56,520
for security training them, working
with them, eating their crappy food,

2005
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,240
living without air condition mean. It
just sucks. It just sucks. It's awful.

2006
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:03,660
Of course. What does Travis to,
Oh, I'm game. Let's do this.

2007
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:06,160
So he went and uh,

2008
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:11,190
obviously he was, he was,
he was killed in action.

2009
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:15,180
He was killed in action during a firefight
trying to, like you just talked about,

2010
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:17,100
wasn't trying to save other marines.

2011
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:22,290
He was trying to save his fellow Iraqi
soldiers. And just like you just said,

2012
01:58:22,410 --> 01:58:27,410
there's so many people
that don't understand how
closely we worked with Iraqi

2013
01:58:28,321 --> 01:58:31,470
soldiers and how committed
we were with helping them.

2014
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:36,750
So that's a classic example.
And by the way,

2015
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:38,760
that that eulogy

2016
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,400
that he wrote for himself

2017
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:49,360
was this Travis Mannion was a man on
afraid to stand for what was right.

2018
01:58:57,990 --> 01:59:00,990
I think that's something that
anybody could aspire towards.

2019
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:08,100
And, and actually another, you know,

2020
01:59:08,101 --> 01:59:09,960
you talked about the connections earlier.

2021
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:15,200
Well there's a connection
here that Travis,

2022
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:17,220
his roommate in the Naval Academy,

2023
01:59:17,221 --> 01:59:21,900
it was a guy by the name of Brendan
Looney who did what you talked about the

2024
01:59:21,901 --> 01:59:23,790
painful way of getting to the seal teams.

2025
01:59:23,791 --> 01:59:25,890
He went to the surface warfare community.

2026
01:59:26,130 --> 01:59:27,600
Then he got picked up for the seal teams,

2027
01:59:27,601 --> 01:59:32,601
went through seal training and he was
also killed in Afghanistan 21 September,

2028
01:59:34,980 --> 01:59:35,320
2010

2029
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:36,153
yeah.

2030
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:41,290
But you come home from that deployment
and now you've got, you're married,

2031
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,800
you got one daughter, you're expecting
another daughter. And by the way,

2032
01:59:46,801 --> 01:59:50,820
this whole time, like we
talked about earlier, you've
been fighting MMA training.

2033
01:59:51,120 --> 01:59:51,631
You fought,

2034
01:59:51,631 --> 01:59:56,631
your first pro fight was
between deployments and
you're amateur fights we're

2035
01:59:57,751 --> 02:00:00,900
going to talk about was before your
first deployment and you make a decision

2036
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:03,420
that all right,
you're gonna get out of the Marine Corps.

2037
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:07,040
And obviously this is probably the hardest
decision you've ever had to make it

2038
02:00:07,041 --> 02:00:08,760
year at that point,
your roto brutal,

2039
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:11,873
but

2040
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:16,440
it's 2007. How much are you, were you,
were you thinking at that time like a,

2041
02:00:16,441 --> 02:00:19,650
I'm going to go for this MMA thing
and it's gonna it's gonna be,

2042
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:21,930
I got a shot at making it,

2043
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:26,040
you know, it was, it was, I knew
I had a shot at you must have,

2044
02:00:26,170 --> 02:00:28,720
you had a shock cause your ass
was undefeated at this point.

2045
02:00:30,640 --> 02:00:33,790
Of course, the worst thing that
could have happened, right? I mean,

2046
02:00:33,791 --> 02:00:36,370
the worst thing I'm training with,

2047
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:39,970
so I would basically go around the
base and I found this corpsman with

2048
02:00:39,971 --> 02:00:43,190
cauliflower ear. Hey, how'd
you get that? Koffler uh,

2049
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:48,160
champ at an Oklahoma wrestling in high
school. Boom, be here 1800 every night.

2050
02:00:48,161 --> 02:00:50,680
Got It all, bring you gear. Cool.

2051
02:00:50,710 --> 02:00:53,860
He was in and he then started
training with a started fighting.

2052
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:57,700
But I got a wrestler dude right now
they're cuter, wrestled. Hey you do,

2053
02:00:57,910 --> 02:01:01,090
you're a blue belt in Jiu Jitsu.
You're my instructor master.

2054
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:06,100
But he was my master. I had no
striking coach. We had no pad work,

2055
02:01:06,101 --> 02:01:06,731
no nothing.

2056
02:01:06,731 --> 02:01:11,731
It was me and a couple of marines plus
a corpsman and we would get after every

2057
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:16,960
day.
And then every time we fought we won.

2058
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:19,450
So we thought we really
knew what we were doing.

2059
02:01:19,451 --> 02:01:22,450
And I would take leave every once in
a while I take leave and I would go to

2060
02:01:22,451 --> 02:01:27,130
extreme couture for a couple of days and
get destroyed. I went out to Temecula,

2061
02:01:27,131 --> 02:01:28,270
to Dan Henderson's place,

2062
02:01:28,600 --> 02:01:32,530
I'd go get destroyed and I just
try and learn to moves. Right.

2063
02:01:32,690 --> 02:01:36,340
Give me two moves.
So here I am in the WC again.

2064
02:01:36,640 --> 02:01:40,580
Armbars from the mount arm bar
from the guard dose. I know it.

2065
02:01:40,581 --> 02:01:44,450
Half Guard is now,
can't sweep a soul from it though.

2066
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:49,250
What Mola Wall showed me how to defend
a single leg and double leg when I was

2067
02:01:49,251 --> 02:01:50,120
out of Temecula.

2068
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:55,330
So now I got that down pat and I still
got a mean jab cross away we go baby and

2069
02:01:57,441 --> 02:02:02,150
I'm winning fights with these things
and you know I would end up losing the

2070
02:02:02,151 --> 02:02:06,590
first time it WC and that would
prompt me to to leave Georgia,

2071
02:02:06,591 --> 02:02:11,591
go find somewhere to train and I'll never
forget my first training session at at

2072
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:16,460
Jackson Winklejohn Academy and I'm there
training and Greg Jackson comes walking

2073
02:02:16,461 --> 02:02:20,740
up to me after my first practice and
this is as polite as he could try to cop.

2074
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,640
Let me at the time Brian,

2075
02:02:22,930 --> 02:02:26,760
I am so amazed at how far you've gone
with how little information you've been

2076
02:02:26,770 --> 02:02:30,770
given a code word. Wow, you suck.

2077
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,650
How the Hell did you win?

2078
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:37,700
One of the things I
explained, I said, look,

2079
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:42,880
when you only know so much you can
fight 150 miles an hour cause you're not

2080
02:02:44,121 --> 02:02:47,330
thinking. Then all of a sudden I'm
learning all these new techniques.

2081
02:02:47,331 --> 02:02:52,010
Then I started thinking I had an up and
down period there where win some lose

2082
02:02:52,011 --> 02:02:56,060
some. And I got to a point where
after the Phil Davis fight, Hey,

2083
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:59,750
you may be out of here.
You know the UFC wasn't a huge fan of me.

2084
02:02:59,751 --> 02:03:01,280
They didn't really care.
They didn't, you know,

2085
02:03:01,281 --> 02:03:04,430
Joseph wasn't a huge fan of these
WVC guys that were forced upon them.

2086
02:03:04,431 --> 02:03:05,300
That wasn't a talent.

2087
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:09,530
He went and found it and I told him I'd
fought three times inside of six months

2088
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:12,240
and I said, look, I need a break. And,

2089
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:16,670
and I literally looked at my MMA training
like you would look at the training of

2090
02:03:16,730 --> 02:03:21,380
a marine company. Where am I
weak? How much time do I have?

2091
02:03:21,680 --> 02:03:23,810
What am I going to schedule?
What am I going to do? Who Do,

2092
02:03:23,811 --> 02:03:26,900
who are the experts I can go to
to get better in all these areas?

2093
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:30,950
And I approached it. I I knew
at that point, hey look, I
still had a fulltime job.

2094
02:03:30,980 --> 02:03:33,890
I never fought without one
transition to the marine corps,

2095
02:03:34,070 --> 02:03:38,630
started working at a company called Med
assets. Med assets had this, this project,

2096
02:03:38,631 --> 02:03:39,171
this thing,

2097
02:03:39,171 --> 02:03:43,280
hey hire heroes when to help vets get
jobs will maybe you could lead that took

2098
02:03:43,281 --> 02:03:46,940
that over. So I'm working every
day but at the same time, you know,

2099
02:03:47,510 --> 02:03:52,510
I started this thing in MMA and I can't
go out like this to many people said I

2100
02:03:53,001 --> 02:03:57,680
was going to wash out, that I was going
to be exposed, couldn't do it. No Way.

2101
02:03:57,860 --> 02:03:59,270
There were too many marines at the time.

2102
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:03,370
Taking pride in my performance is in
there and although I was older, yeah,

2103
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:07,880
I'm 20 probably 29 at that time. So
in terms of MMA age, I'm already,

2104
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:10,190
I'm green and I'm already
kind of getting a little old,

2105
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:13,840
but I started to find a way
starting to figure it out and, and,

2106
02:04:13,850 --> 02:04:17,030
and not cutting any corners like
other fighters were at the time,

2107
02:04:17,330 --> 02:04:18,440
but starting to figure it out.

2108
02:04:18,441 --> 02:04:23,441
And it all just came down to discipline
where a lot of martial artists don't

2109
02:04:23,511 --> 02:04:24,440
want to spend time,

2110
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:29,800
they don't want to spend 30
minutes drilling one move
and understanding how they

2111
02:04:29,811 --> 02:04:32,900
could use that move from various
positions and why it works.

2112
02:04:32,901 --> 02:04:37,680
And how it plays into my style of
fighting, why it will effective.

2113
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:39,510
They want to drill that one move,

2114
02:04:39,511 --> 02:04:43,890
they want to do it five times and then
they want to go live. Let's go live,

2115
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:44,724
let's go live.

2116
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:50,850
And I had alerted that point if I'm
going to catch up with these fighters who

2117
02:04:50,851 --> 02:04:54,630
are younger in many cases,
but much more experienced than me.

2118
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:56,160
I have got,

2119
02:04:56,640 --> 02:05:00,800
I've got to take an analytical approach
and an honest approach to my skillset

2120
02:05:00,870 --> 02:05:04,590
and start to shore up some holes or else
I'm going to continue to lose practice.

2121
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:09,240
Just wrestling like crazy. And then
submission avoidance. It was, it was,

2122
02:05:09,300 --> 02:05:11,790
I actually went and put a g
on for the first time ever.

2123
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:15,120
It was working some basics because
everybody wanted to hold me down.

2124
02:05:15,330 --> 02:05:17,560
If I could get out from underneath
somebody with a Guianan,

2125
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:19,590
it's gonna be a heck of a
lot easier. Gnocchi, truth,

2126
02:05:19,650 --> 02:05:22,710
I was bringing in wrestlers
that were way above my level.

2127
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:24,840
A guy named Harry Lester,
who was, you know,

2128
02:05:24,841 --> 02:05:29,340
in the Olympian was coming in and
throwing me all over the place.

2129
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,270
And so I was training,

2130
02:05:30,271 --> 02:05:34,560
wrestling nonstop and then I would
go and I'd go to Albuquerque.

2131
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:35,430
I didn't have a fight coming up,

2132
02:05:35,431 --> 02:05:38,610
but I would go live in Albuquerque for
two weeks at a time away from my family

2133
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:43,290
and help other guys and their training
camps and get exposed in drill and

2134
02:05:43,291 --> 02:05:48,060
without, here's the other big part
was guys like Rashad Evans, Keith,

2135
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:52,200
your dean, Joey via Senor, Nate
Marquardt. Without those guys,

2136
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:55,050
it would've never happened because after
they would beat me after they would

2137
02:05:55,051 --> 02:05:58,380
pass my guard, take me down,
hit me with this combination,

2138
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:01,230
they would stop afterwards
and tell me how and why,

2139
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:06,540
and so I learned at a much faster rate
than your typical fighter would because

2140
02:06:06,541 --> 02:06:08,880
not only am I, I'm drilling with
some of the best in the world,

2141
02:06:09,030 --> 02:06:12,210
taking the time to drill and
take an analytical approach, hey,

2142
02:06:12,211 --> 02:06:13,890
I know we're going to work this today,
coach,

2143
02:06:14,160 --> 02:06:18,090
but my butterfly guard is completely
ineffective and I'd love to work at

2144
02:06:18,091 --> 02:06:21,540
specifically not just on sweeping because
I don't think I'm going to get there

2145
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:23,460
yet against my level of competition.
Just get up.

2146
02:06:23,490 --> 02:06:27,240
I'd love to use it to get up or even just
get to the fence where now I've got a

2147
02:06:27,241 --> 02:06:32,241
third leg that I could utilize to get
back up until we would drill specifics

2148
02:06:32,431 --> 02:06:33,240
like that.

2149
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:38,240
And I've got these guys who have 30 plus
fights who are champions now taking the

2150
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:43,500
time to help me, which meant a
lot to me. I'll never forget it.

2151
02:06:43,501 --> 02:06:47,880
I mean they were as much coaches to me
as Mike Winkeljohn and Greg Jackson where

2152
02:06:48,210 --> 02:06:51,600
you know, and then you know, obviously
on top of you could do all of that.

2153
02:06:51,601 --> 02:06:54,630
The other piece of it was when
I would do my camps there,

2154
02:06:54,631 --> 02:06:56,700
when I really got where I was at my best,
you know,

2155
02:06:56,701 --> 02:06:59,080
when I be Chris leave binge or Santiago,
let's just go.

2156
02:06:59,100 --> 02:07:03,060
When I was beating those guys mentally,
I was in the best place.

2157
02:07:03,300 --> 02:07:06,960
My family was in it when it
was in a great spot. They were,

2158
02:07:06,990 --> 02:07:10,770
my wife and kids were very supportive
of me leaving and doing my camps in

2159
02:07:10,771 --> 02:07:15,300
Albuquerque and my time away from them.
It made me nasty. They'd come visit.

2160
02:07:15,870 --> 02:07:18,240
But man, I would literally
look at my opponent like,

2161
02:07:18,241 --> 02:07:20,790
you're the one who kept me
away from my family this long,

2162
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,290
you're going to pay for it. And, and
it was, it was a strong motivator.

2163
02:07:25,620 --> 02:07:30,210
And that if you're in a place to
fight or where you're not hungry,

2164
02:07:30,570 --> 02:07:32,040
getting new information,

2165
02:07:32,430 --> 02:07:35,790
being able to mentally be in the
right place for you to perform.

2166
02:07:35,791 --> 02:07:38,560
This is not about who the better
fighter is. It has nothing to do it.

2167
02:07:38,740 --> 02:07:40,690
It's about who fights best that night.

2168
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:44,590
And if you can't mentally be in the state
where you're going to fight best that

2169
02:07:44,591 --> 02:07:48,250
night, you got a problem and you're
in the wrong place. And that, that,

2170
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:52,360
that phase of my career, that's when I
was, I was there, I was able to do that.

2171
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:55,100
And that was, that was when I
was at my best. For sure. You,

2172
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:58,210
I mean you had some stunning fights.
I know. I always tell, you know,

2173
02:07:58,211 --> 02:08:01,060
sometime my fighters will say all, you
know, I'm not, I'm not feeling it tonight.

2174
02:08:01,130 --> 02:08:05,470
It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter you
like this isn't training. I'll say, look,

2175
02:08:05,471 --> 02:08:07,660
it doesn't matter how you feel
tonight cause a fight night comes,

2176
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:09,700
you might be feeling
good, bad, doesn't matter.

2177
02:08:09,701 --> 02:08:11,620
What you have to do is perform right now.
That's what you gotta do.

2178
02:08:11,860 --> 02:08:15,690
So train yourself to perform right
now. But yeah, you had some, uh,

2179
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:20,280
you had some great fights. Um, and Chris
Liebing who I know trained with Chris,

2180
02:08:20,330 --> 02:08:22,320
great guy and that,

2181
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:27,420
and he's such a tough bastard
and you guys threw down.

2182
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:32,680
Yeah, we knew, we knew neither one of
us are going to be that hard to hit. Um,

2183
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:38,470
but uh,
no tons of respect for that guy.

2184
02:08:38,470 --> 02:08:40,390
And that was a fight he
didn't have to take, you know,

2185
02:08:40,450 --> 02:08:44,000
I saw an opening there where
there was a window and,

2186
02:08:44,001 --> 02:08:47,080
and he made just take me as a, as a
fight to, okay, let me go get a win,

2187
02:08:47,081 --> 02:08:49,540
get some money and,
and go on.

2188
02:08:49,541 --> 02:08:53,020
Cause he had just come off two huge
wins and like a week or 10 days,

2189
02:08:53,021 --> 02:08:57,610
no psycho and so of them,
phenomenal guy in this sport.

2190
02:08:57,910 --> 02:09:02,710
And Yeah. You know, it was a wild ride.
I, and when I look back on it, there's,

2191
02:09:02,711 --> 02:09:04,710
there's definitely some regrets.
Like anybody there,

2192
02:09:04,720 --> 02:09:08,050
there's some things you wish you
wish you could have done. Um,

2193
02:09:08,110 --> 02:09:12,660
some things that happened familywise
that certainly stalled and in,

2194
02:09:12,661 --> 02:09:17,140
in helped aid the decision to
stop, you know, my wife losing,

2195
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:19,840
losing her little brother to
suicide was a really tough thing.

2196
02:09:19,841 --> 02:09:22,360
Her mom was living with us at the time,
so you know,

2197
02:09:22,361 --> 02:09:24,190
us going through that tragedy together.
It's hard.

2198
02:09:24,191 --> 02:09:28,000
We were human beings and a lot of fighters
have to deal with tragedy and compete.

2199
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:30,250
This is what we do for living.
We've got to fight through it.

2200
02:09:30,610 --> 02:09:35,610
It's a hard thing when I look back on it
where I know I was as an athlete and as

2201
02:09:35,831 --> 02:09:36,641
a mixed martial arts,

2202
02:09:36,641 --> 02:09:41,641
how green I was to have come that far
and been a legitimate top 10 middleweight

2203
02:09:42,010 --> 02:09:45,140
at that time. I'm proud
of that, especially here,

2204
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:49,050
especially in the era when I fought
were there were some extra curricular

2205
02:09:49,090 --> 02:09:52,610
activities going on as well. I'm against
guys that were a lot of guys we're on,

2206
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:56,050
we're on steroids. There was no testing
or there was really limited tests.

2207
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:59,200
It was an Iq test, right? If you
fail that you, you know, you're just,

2208
02:09:59,201 --> 02:10:01,590
you're just straight up dumb.
Uh,

2209
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:06,520
but it was fun and I mean the guys you
like, you lost a Chail Sona, right?

2210
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:10,600
Who was two minutes from being the,
the,

2211
02:10:10,601 --> 02:10:14,790
the middle weight champion of the world
against Anderson Silva. Uh, you know, you,

2212
02:10:14,791 --> 02:10:18,880
you lost to him, you beat
Sacara. Then you lost a Biz Bang.

2213
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:21,400
Who actually is the current
middle weight champion. So,

2214
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:24,700
and the guys that beat you were
bad asses. Yeah, absolutely.

2215
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:29,480
And you were a guy that will like started
fighting three weeks ago. You know,

2216
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:31,770
that's just awesome, man. It's
a testament that, you know,

2217
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:36,170
the coolest part about it was,
was during that time, you know,

2218
02:10:36,171 --> 02:10:39,170
in any kind of happened
subtly beneath that, you know,

2219
02:10:39,171 --> 02:10:41,480
at least to the fight fans was,

2220
02:10:41,481 --> 02:10:46,190
was taken that that little hire heroes
USA project that that company Med assets

2221
02:10:46,191 --> 02:10:50,090
asked me to watch over,
right? Step one was,

2222
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,590
we're starting to build some programs.

2223
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:55,490
Step two was getting one of my best
friends in the world who served with me,

2224
02:10:55,491 --> 02:10:59,750
who is right next to that track as it
burned Nate Smith to come and be my chief

2225
02:10:59,751 --> 02:11:04,751
operating officer and build this amazing
team and leveraging some of the media

2226
02:11:04,971 --> 02:11:09,890
attention I got for fighting. Leveraging
it for our cause in building it and,

2227
02:11:09,891 --> 02:11:12,170
and not just building a company
where, hey, we went out,

2228
02:11:12,171 --> 02:11:14,690
we fundraise for a
mission. No, that's bogus.

2229
02:11:14,691 --> 02:11:16,910
We were out there
accomplishing the mission,

2230
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:20,870
helping veterans get legitimate jobs,

2231
02:11:20,871 --> 02:11:25,871
careers so that they can succeed and
lead again back here home and in their

2232
02:11:27,471 --> 02:11:32,471
communities and watching it grow from a
team of five to a team of 10 to a team

2233
02:11:32,931 --> 02:11:37,340
of 22 are now we've got 96
full time employees and we're,

2234
02:11:37,341 --> 02:11:41,660
we're bringing in over 300 veterans and
spouses a week into the programs and

2235
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:45,650
that that was all built with
this amazing team of people.

2236
02:11:45,860 --> 02:11:50,510
While I was still fighting that that
was my full time job doing that and in

2237
02:11:50,511 --> 02:11:55,511
having a board of directors that had
the foresight and and the perspective to

2238
02:11:56,121 --> 02:11:58,040
say, Hey, you know what? Yes,

2239
02:11:58,070 --> 02:12:00,560
you're going to be a little limited
during some of these training camps.

2240
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:05,800
Bought what you're able to bring to our
brand is helpful right now in the phase

2241
02:12:06,531 --> 02:12:08,220
at this company is and,

2242
02:12:08,350 --> 02:12:13,350
and it's been a wild
and really amazing ride.

2243
02:12:13,431 --> 02:12:15,980
And in some of the things we talked about
earlier where you have these things,

2244
02:12:15,981 --> 02:12:19,460
these questions that will always haunt
you about the loss of your friends,

2245
02:12:19,461 --> 02:12:21,560
the last few marines,
the loss of your seals.

2246
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:26,030
When you can lead an initiative like
that, it helps you feel like, hey,

2247
02:12:26,031 --> 02:12:28,820
you know what I am.
I am taking advantage of every day,

2248
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:31,430
every day we're moving forward,
we're achieving,

2249
02:12:31,431 --> 02:12:36,431
we're helping other warriors now find
success post military service and,

2250
02:12:36,730 --> 02:12:40,400
and that's me earning it,
earning my day where they don't.

2251
02:12:40,430 --> 02:12:41,510
They no longer have any,
you know,

2252
02:12:41,511 --> 02:12:45,410
Travis may need to live anymore and his
family would give anything to see him

2253
02:12:45,411 --> 02:12:49,220
one more time. I can't bring him
back, but I'll tell you what,

2254
02:12:49,221 --> 02:12:52,550
if I sat here crying about it,
feeling sorry for myself,

2255
02:12:52,551 --> 02:12:54,080
that my friend Travis was gone,

2256
02:12:54,590 --> 02:12:58,580
he'd be the first a slap the
hell out of me when I die for,

2257
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:02,890
or at least do double leg on your ass.
He was, I'm telling you me and that,

2258
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:06,120
that was he planned on fighting
when he got done with that women,

2259
02:13:06,150 --> 02:13:11,090
he'd still be fighting to this day. He
was a bad, bad dude. And that was your,

2260
02:13:11,140 --> 02:13:16,130
your last fight in the UFC. You retired
after you fought Vandelay Silva,

2261
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:20,800
which did you plan no to do that?

2262
02:13:20,801 --> 02:13:24,200
So you don't know that aren't MMA?
There's a guy,

2263
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:28,370
a legendary mixed martial
artists named Vandelay Silva.

2264
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:32,610
I saw him fight a few times and we're
in Japan back in the back in the day and

2265
02:13:32,820 --> 02:13:37,320
he's a, he's a brawler and
he's incredible punching power.

2266
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:42,360
And his nickname is the ax murderer
because he looks like a psycho. And uh,

2267
02:13:42,780 --> 02:13:43,613
anyways,

2268
02:13:43,710 --> 02:13:47,910
Brian had a fight with him and
these two guys went in there.

2269
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:53,190
It was like Russian roulette.
It was a street fight.

2270
02:13:53,460 --> 02:13:55,500
And eventually you got caught,
you know,

2271
02:13:55,501 --> 02:13:59,340
got caught by one of the best strikers
that have ever been in the game. And um,

2272
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:05,220
and that, and by the way, you dropped
him a couple times. You, you had that,

2273
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:07,620
you didn't have it one,
but you definitely,

2274
02:14:07,950 --> 02:14:11,210
you dropped him two or three times in
the first round or twice the first one

2275
02:14:11,240 --> 02:14:16,050
back from the dead, a minimum
of two times. The eyes were
in the back of his head.

2276
02:14:16,051 --> 02:14:19,830
And then he just, he looked at me
again with bloodshot eyes. It was,

2277
02:14:19,831 --> 02:14:24,090
it was unbelievable. Unbelievable.
But no, that was not the plan.

2278
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:28,740
And so you with Greg Jackson, wink, right?

2279
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:31,340
Ah,
I wasn't ISO for the,

2280
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:35,940
the other Sacara Bisbing and
Vandelay fight. I trained myself.

2281
02:14:36,450 --> 02:14:39,300
And the reason being was,
uh,

2282
02:14:39,330 --> 02:14:41,880
right after I had fought shell
son in two days before Christmas,

2283
02:14:41,881 --> 02:14:46,140
me and my wife land in baggage claim and
I get a call and in her little brother

2284
02:14:46,141 --> 02:14:50,310
who had struggled with bipolar
disorder and depression,

2285
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:54,420
and we didn't know that debt,
right? He had taken his own
life, went up to a cabin,

2286
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:56,040
middle of the woods
and taken his own life,

2287
02:14:56,190 --> 02:14:59,670
had to tell my wife there in baggage
claim and her mom at the time was living

2288
02:14:59,671 --> 02:15:04,020
with us. It was personal life was a
mess. Still got to pay bills though,

2289
02:15:04,550 --> 02:15:06,210
right? You still, it's
still got a company to run.

2290
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:09,360
So I gotta fight career that I've got to
push through and I can't just, hey look,

2291
02:15:09,361 --> 02:15:12,600
I'm going to take seven months off here
to get through this because I got bills

2292
02:15:12,601 --> 02:15:14,310
to pay anyways.
It,

2293
02:15:14,360 --> 02:15:19,200
it caused me to start my own camps so
that the game plan going in was, hey,

2294
02:15:19,201 --> 02:15:19,650
we're going to,

2295
02:15:19,650 --> 02:15:23,100
we're going to take Vandelay down a
little bit in this fight and disrupt him.

2296
02:15:23,490 --> 02:15:27,120
Really, really confused them because
nobody's, nobody's used to me doing that.

2297
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:30,150
And so I fly to Japan,

2298
02:15:30,720 --> 02:15:34,380
we get off the plaintiff that long
flight after a long training camp where I

2299
02:15:34,440 --> 02:15:38,250
absolutely overtrained and
we get to the hotel and, and,

2300
02:15:38,251 --> 02:15:41,520
and me and one of my striking coaches
Mizuna tall, we go start hitting pads,

2301
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:44,280
we're hitting pads and pad works done it.
Oh Man.

2302
02:15:44,281 --> 02:15:47,670
All of a sudden I start to cool down.
I can't lift my knee up on my left leg,

2303
02:15:49,020 --> 02:15:52,000
tear something in my head.
And it happens, right? I mean,

2304
02:15:52,150 --> 02:15:54,730
evangelist could have walked in there and
how many miles he could've walked into

2305
02:15:54,731 --> 02:15:58,890
a couple of injuries. So anyways, now
this gets into my head a little bit.

2306
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:03,810
And so I asked to see the UFC doctor
and so he, as soon as he landed,

2307
02:16:03,811 --> 02:16:06,330
he was told, hey, you got to
go see Brian Stan. I say, look,

2308
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:09,450
I've looked at all this stuff.
Nova Cain is legal.

2309
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,330
I just want to get novacane for
fight night. So I won't feel it.

2310
02:16:13,260 --> 02:16:15,720
And I'm walking around the hotel and
I'm trying not to show anybody that I'm

2311
02:16:15,721 --> 02:16:20,550
limping at the press conference cause
I have a legitimate limp. And anyways,

2312
02:16:20,910 --> 02:16:22,620
he's like, okay, we
should be, we're in Japan,

2313
02:16:22,621 --> 02:16:25,290
we're not in a second or third world
country. We're in Tokyo. Right.

2314
02:16:25,291 --> 02:16:26,970
I could have walked across the street,
probably got in late.

2315
02:16:26,971 --> 02:16:29,560
It can't anyways supposed to get,
it's supposed to get us,

2316
02:16:29,561 --> 02:16:31,880
but I'm going to get it on me to
get them to get it doesn't get it.

2317
02:16:32,400 --> 02:16:35,890
When you find Japan the fight so that
they could cater the American TV audience,

2318
02:16:35,891 --> 02:16:38,860
you leave at like 7:00 AM.
So he's sitting there, sorry.

2319
02:16:39,460 --> 02:16:42,700
So I let that affect me
too much mentally and,

2320
02:16:42,701 --> 02:16:46,060
and we're trying to warm up backstage
and I'm trying to shoot some double legs

2321
02:16:46,061 --> 02:16:49,600
and I'm not feeling it. And in my own
head rate for a walk, I'm like, you know,

2322
02:16:49,601 --> 02:16:53,440
up the student, get some miles
on him. I hit like a truck.

2323
02:16:53,950 --> 02:16:58,390
Let's get in there. Let's knock this dude
out and let's get this fight over with.

2324
02:16:58,570 --> 02:17:03,430
So ready to go walk out there.
And he tags me first,

2325
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:07,360
hits me behind the ear and,
and you know most of vandelays fights,

2326
02:17:07,361 --> 02:17:09,290
he's a little bit more
of an accumulation guy.

2327
02:17:09,290 --> 02:17:11,380
He's not considered a
one punch knockout guy.

2328
02:17:12,010 --> 02:17:13,420
This one right hand he hits me with,

2329
02:17:13,421 --> 02:17:17,410
I had never been rocked in the AUC gum
before in my life and he dropped me.

2330
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:20,200
I was like, all right, it's on, let's go.

2331
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:23,500
And so then I rock him and once
I rocked him they thought, okay,

2332
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:26,770
one more good shot on
the chin and he's done.

2333
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:32,460
And I landed it and he'd go down and
then he'd come back and the wait a minute

2334
02:17:33,071 --> 02:17:34,150
here.
And so I'm just caught up.

2335
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:37,540
And so the second round I start to get a
little more technical and move around a

2336
02:17:37,541 --> 02:17:40,330
little bit. Like, all right,
he's obviously not going away.

2337
02:17:40,331 --> 02:17:42,360
I've got to take a different approach.
Well,

2338
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:45,360
I don't know what this guy has made
of. And, and then he, I didn't even,

2339
02:17:45,361 --> 02:17:48,280
I don't remember her, you know, I
get caught with that huge punch,

2340
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:53,110
don't remember any of it. And
it's crazy. But I realized I lost,

2341
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,010
I came to,
as Jon Anik,

2342
02:17:57,011 --> 02:18:00,430
who's one of my closest friends now comes
up to the microphone and I realized,

2343
02:18:00,431 --> 02:18:04,340
well, I don't remember
women. So why most losses.

2344
02:18:06,010 --> 02:18:07,960
And it was a horrible flight home.

2345
02:18:07,961 --> 02:18:12,961
I'm sitting there flying home and
I had a jack and coke in my hand,

2346
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:17,230
couldn't sleep at all, didn't
sleep, and I am miserable.

2347
02:18:18,010 --> 02:18:21,280
I lost to a guy who was supposed to beat,
who was supposed to be washed up,

2348
02:18:21,520 --> 02:18:24,790
you know, I had pretty much made the
decision then you know, I'm, I'm, I'm out.

2349
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:28,000
It's over. If you're not going
to get busy being the champion,

2350
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:33,060
then there's other areas where that need
my attention more from my family to the

2351
02:18:33,281 --> 02:18:36,220
company I'm trying to run and
it was a hard decision and in,

2352
02:18:36,221 --> 02:18:38,530
pardon me when I made the
decision thought for sure.

2353
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:40,460
I'm definitely in a comeback, right? I'm,

2354
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:42,580
I'm going to come back
in for like two years.

2355
02:18:42,581 --> 02:18:44,860
I held onto that and had to
fight against it. Like, no,

2356
02:18:44,861 --> 02:18:47,050
it is not your best interest
to come back anymore.

2357
02:18:47,970 --> 02:18:50,380
You do a better job talking
about in the microphone.

2358
02:18:50,381 --> 02:18:53,320
Then you're going to do strap and the
gloves on any more pal. You're 35 now.

2359
02:18:53,321 --> 02:18:57,430
I'm 36 it's over.
That makes me feel real good over here.

2360
02:18:59,680 --> 02:19:02,350
So you know,
we've been going for a while.

2361
02:19:03,550 --> 02:19:07,840
Tell us about like specifically
with with hire heroes, what,

2362
02:19:07,870 --> 02:19:09,790
how can people support that?
Where do we look for it?

2363
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:12,520
All that stuff so that way people
have information on it. Yes,

2364
02:19:12,521 --> 02:19:13,400
we've got a website,

2365
02:19:13,420 --> 02:19:18,420
hire heroes usa.org and if you are a
service member or a spouse who needs help

2366
02:19:19,571 --> 02:19:22,000
finding a career,
if you're unemployed or underemployed,

2367
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:26,020
you go on there your register and we'll
get you your personal veteran transition

2368
02:19:26,021 --> 02:19:28,150
specialist.
Fancy term for a job coach.

2369
02:19:28,151 --> 02:19:32,300
And we'll take you through the whole
thing from revising your resume, uh,

2370
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:35,420
to teach you how to effectively do a
job search, how to interview for a job.

2371
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:38,810
We will help you if not build
your linkedin site for you.

2372
02:19:38,811 --> 02:19:42,350
Teach you how to use that to
impact and expand your network.

2373
02:19:42,351 --> 02:19:44,030
Do social media audits.
Hey,

2374
02:19:44,031 --> 02:19:48,170
what pictures and posts as you not have
up on Facebook right now, you know,

2375
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:51,830
take a look. Hey, no big papa pump
at Yahoo is not your email anymore.

2376
02:19:52,250 --> 02:19:57,110
It's going to be christinaSmith@yahoo.com
are all the do's or don'ts.

2377
02:19:57,111 --> 02:19:59,210
But then we have a job or a
lot of corporate partners.

2378
02:19:59,211 --> 02:20:02,060
We'll match you to all those companies,
but we do so people,

2379
02:20:02,360 --> 02:20:06,460
if people want to hire a veteran
they can absolutely you as well as,

2380
02:20:06,670 --> 02:20:09,380
that's the one thing I get hit
with a lot is you know people say,

2381
02:20:09,381 --> 02:20:11,610
how can we help veterans?
And I say hire veterans and they say,

2382
02:20:11,611 --> 02:20:13,770
where do we find him? So now we've got
to put good place to find a solution.

2383
02:20:13,830 --> 02:20:14,090
Women,

2384
02:20:14,090 --> 02:20:18,230
we're bringing in over 300 people a week
in the program who are all going to get

2385
02:20:18,231 --> 02:20:21,380
one on one assistance and and
different from any other nonprofit.

2386
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:23,840
Everything we do is tracked,

2387
02:20:23,870 --> 02:20:28,520
logged and analyze and salesforce so
that we can hold ourselves accountable.

2388
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:32,030
I can hold every one of my employees
accountable for the workload they have.

2389
02:20:32,031 --> 02:20:36,080
They all have weekly, monthly, quarterly
and annual metrics that they have to hit.

2390
02:20:36,530 --> 02:20:38,090
They don't hit them,
they no longer work.

2391
02:20:38,091 --> 02:20:42,530
Here we run this non profit
like a business because
people donate money to us to

2392
02:20:42,531 --> 02:20:46,910
help veterans find careers, period. And
if we're not doing that, then we go away.

2393
02:20:47,330 --> 02:20:51,350
And I take that very serious and it's
what's allowed us to grow from a team of

2394
02:20:51,351 --> 02:20:55,100
four to now a team of 96
it will continue to do so.

2395
02:20:55,101 --> 02:20:59,150
And my main mission now is to make sure
hire heroes USA is there for the next

2396
02:20:59,151 --> 02:21:03,020
generation of combat veterans as well
when they return home to a society that

2397
02:21:03,021 --> 02:21:06,200
doesn't understand them as
much and in the real help,

2398
02:21:06,201 --> 02:21:10,910
the real need is for the veteran to
learn how to communicate their skill set,

2399
02:21:10,911 --> 02:21:14,390
how to deliver their value proposition.
It's a hard thing to do.

2400
02:21:14,660 --> 02:21:16,430
Think about your seals when they got out,

2401
02:21:16,431 --> 02:21:18,200
if they went to a job to
try to write a resume,

2402
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:21,920
what the hell do I put my first resume
looked like I was trying to get a job as

2403
02:21:21,921 --> 02:21:25,040
a mercenary.
It was all and I was a Naval Academy Grad.

2404
02:21:25,220 --> 02:21:28,630
Imagine these young
sailors, you know, and,

2405
02:21:28,730 --> 02:21:33,200
and over 80% of the people we help at
hire heroes or your young enlisted service

2406
02:21:33,201 --> 02:21:35,780
members, the ones who need us
the most. Awesome. Awesome.

2407
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:40,490
And then you've got the Guardian
project going on. Incredible project.

2408
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:43,220
And I'd love to to,
to get these guys down.

2409
02:21:43,221 --> 02:21:46,550
Ben Kovacs who's our executive director
come down and be on your show some day.

2410
02:21:46,551 --> 02:21:50,450
It's, it's so in line with some of your
beliefs on martial arts in Jujitsu.

2411
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:55,400
Ben Has a vision that every kid should
have the opportunity to train martial

2412
02:21:55,401 --> 02:21:58,280
arts,
every child check and,

2413
02:21:58,281 --> 02:22:03,281
and so he went out network and found a
man by the name of Joel on unfelt who's

2414
02:22:03,411 --> 02:22:07,010
on my board at hire heroes who's an
executive at Twitter and they bought a

2415
02:22:07,011 --> 02:22:11,180
property in Oakland where there are a
lot of young men and women who don't have

2416
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:13,490
much going on after school and they don't,
they,

2417
02:22:13,491 --> 02:22:15,680
that the chips are stacked against them.
Yeah,

2418
02:22:15,681 --> 02:22:18,290
there's not a whole lot that
they have, you know, their,

2419
02:22:18,291 --> 02:22:20,630
their families have a hard time making
money and there's a lot of trouble they

2420
02:22:20,631 --> 02:22:24,110
can get into and they will find them
and they bring them in and they come,

2421
02:22:24,290 --> 02:22:27,360
they train martial arts, they
trained Jujitsu, they trained boxing,

2422
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,500
they do their homework.

2423
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:32,040
Then they've networked with local
restaurants and they get a healthy meal

2424
02:22:32,041 --> 02:22:35,220
afterwards for free. In many cases,
these are, this is the health,

2425
02:22:35,221 --> 02:22:38,040
the only healthy meal that that young
man or woman's going to get that day.

2426
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:41,970
They have regular members to the gym,
but those members pay a membership fee.

2427
02:22:41,971 --> 02:22:45,960
That also then pays for those young
kids so that they can come for free.

2428
02:22:46,590 --> 02:22:50,640
People buy a gift for themselves. Then
they get a freaky for one of the kids.

2429
02:22:50,940 --> 02:22:54,450
I've gone there and talk and
ransom classes and it is just,

2430
02:22:54,451 --> 02:22:58,620
it's incredible to meet these young men
and women who haven't been given much in

2431
02:22:58,621 --> 02:22:59,310
life.

2432
02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:02,160
Their parents are grateful because now
they're not paying for after school care.

2433
02:23:02,161 --> 02:23:04,500
They can't afford it anyways,
and their kids not wandering the streets,

2434
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:09,890
but now they've got this place to go to
where there's likeminded people pushing

2435
02:23:09,901 --> 02:23:10,920
them to do better.

2436
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:16,340
Don't allow your circumstances to direct
and direct your life until you who

2437
02:23:17,521 --> 02:23:19,950
you're going to be.
Nothing should hold you back.

2438
02:23:20,580 --> 02:23:23,880
So the discipline that they're
learning now, the camaraderie,

2439
02:23:23,881 --> 02:23:27,120
that character they're learning
at Guardian is starting
to spill into the other

2440
02:23:27,121 --> 02:23:31,410
aspects of their life. Their grades are
going up, they're being more nutritious,

2441
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:34,950
they're focused on their future. Hey,
wait a minute, college, I can go.

2442
02:23:35,010 --> 02:23:36,090
I can go to college.

2443
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:39,570
They've got these great
positive inspirations around
him and the goal is to take

2444
02:23:39,571 --> 02:23:44,571
guardian from Oakland and start to to to
brand it and get it in gyms across the

2445
02:23:44,881 --> 02:23:47,820
country where now we don't need
a physical facility to do it in.

2446
02:23:47,850 --> 02:23:51,900
Other gyms can take on the program where
now we've got a system where they can

2447
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:55,410
adopt it and people can pay their
membership as part of a way of paying the

2448
02:23:55,411 --> 02:23:58,920
membership to these underprivileged kids
to go there and train afterschool as

2449
02:23:58,921 --> 02:24:00,450
well so that they can have a chance.

2450
02:24:00,630 --> 02:24:03,900
Just because they're poor doesn't mean
they should get the opportunity to train

2451
02:24:03,901 --> 02:24:05,280
Jujitsu,
to train boxing,

2452
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:08,790
to get all the character development
that goes along with martial arts.

2453
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,770
That's all I got.
I actually,

2454
02:24:10,771 --> 02:24:13,750
I got another book coming out in the
book is called the way of the war,

2455
02:24:13,751 --> 02:24:18,420
your kid and it's a kid's book and
it's basically about a young kid who's

2456
02:24:18,540 --> 02:24:22,110
getting picked on at school.
He can't do any pull ups. He,

2457
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:26,880
he doesn't know his times tables
and is basically miserable, right.

2458
02:24:27,120 --> 02:24:28,080
And anyways,

2459
02:24:28,530 --> 02:24:32,970
school ends and his uncle Jake comes
out to stay with them for the summer.

2460
02:24:33,420 --> 02:24:36,990
Uncle Jack as a team guy. So uncle
Jake says, oh, you got some issues.

2461
02:24:36,991 --> 02:24:40,020
What are the issues? Oh, I can't do pull.
He goes, I, we can fix all those things.

2462
02:24:40,230 --> 02:24:43,650
So one of the, you know, obviously
get some working out. Oh,

2463
02:24:43,651 --> 02:24:45,900
you're getting bullied because
he's getting bullied badly.

2464
02:24:45,930 --> 02:24:48,510
Well guess where he's going to learn?
He's going to learn Jujitsu.

2465
02:24:48,630 --> 02:24:52,770
So I honestly think there's going to be
a little bit of a surge of Jujitsu in

2466
02:24:52,771 --> 02:24:57,330
America. I love it. And it
sounds like this is right up
there, right up that alley.

2467
02:24:57,480 --> 02:25:01,290
It is. You know, when, when that comes
out, we're going to grab a bunch of them,

2468
02:25:01,291 --> 02:25:04,650
make it mandatory for these kids,
things like that. Inspire them. I mean,

2469
02:25:04,651 --> 02:25:07,830
they make a difference when you look at
the just the social and economic impact,

2470
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:13,290
young man or woman who has a high
likelihood of probably getting arrested,

2471
02:25:13,291 --> 02:25:16,620
especially when you look at some of
the problems we have with our criminal

2472
02:25:16,621 --> 02:25:20,580
justice system right now. Instead they
have a positive environment and never get,

2473
02:25:20,581 --> 02:25:23,560
they go into college and they go get
a great job and they're contributing.

2474
02:25:23,800 --> 02:25:27,520
They're winning now.
Huge impact for our country,

2475
02:25:27,521 --> 02:25:30,970
for our communities to do that
and and to get more Jujitsu,

2476
02:25:30,971 --> 02:25:32,650
more martial arts and some of these,

2477
02:25:32,860 --> 02:25:37,330
these poor super rural areas in our
country where there's extreme poverty and

2478
02:25:37,331 --> 02:25:40,930
are super urban areas where there's
extreme poverty where these young men and

2479
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:44,200
women don't get that opportunity because
their parents can't pay $150 a month

2480
02:25:44,201 --> 02:25:47,440
for them to go and they don't have
any positive influences in their life.

2481
02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:48,583
I mean at that,

2482
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:52,870
if that can fix a lot of problems
that we have going on in our country,

2483
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:57,180
there's no doubt does. Is there a way
to help the Guardian project right now?

2484
02:25:57,460 --> 02:26:00,550
Go to go to guardian project.org
there's a website right there.

2485
02:26:00,551 --> 02:26:03,850
You can become a monthly sponsor.
I mean, that organization is, is,

2486
02:26:03,851 --> 02:26:08,830
is in startup phase. If someone could
give five the $10 a month to them,

2487
02:26:09,130 --> 02:26:14,130
that is a huge portion of a young man or
woman's monthly membership for them to

2488
02:26:14,291 --> 02:26:18,220
go to that gym, get a free meal, have
someone looking at the report card,

2489
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:20,950
tutoring them in math,
teaching them Jujitsu.

2490
02:26:21,160 --> 02:26:25,210
Confidence mean that we get young
ladies in there and they're in their,

2491
02:26:25,211 --> 02:26:29,060
their confidence when they start
dating and who they choose and how,

2492
02:26:29,090 --> 02:26:31,120
I mean the way they're
going to approach life,

2493
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:35,830
these young men and understanding how to
respect and train with the young lady,

2494
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:39,610
Hey, I'm going to grapple with you
this round and how to respect you all.

2495
02:26:39,611 --> 02:26:40,441
I mean it's,

2496
02:26:40,441 --> 02:26:43,750
it's amazing to watch it's happening
at a young age and how quickly they're

2497
02:26:43,751 --> 02:26:47,800
developing. It's awesome.
That's awesome. So hire heroes,

2498
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:52,330
the Guardian project
organizations to support,

2499
02:26:53,710 --> 02:26:57,940
and I guess that kind of wraps it with us.

2500
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:01,390
If anybody wanted to support this podcast.
Echo Charles,

2501
02:27:02,590 --> 02:27:05,830
I have a question. Oh, echo
comes with a deep question.

2502
02:27:05,831 --> 02:27:09,520
Got a question kind of deep.
So when you watch a few good men,

2503
02:27:09,620 --> 02:27:12,280
are you like on the side of the Marines?
Like the whole movie?

2504
02:27:14,030 --> 02:27:18,130
I'm saying don't group me with them
just because I wear the same uniform.

2505
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:22,600
You know a few good men,
he's going against the navy.
Tom Cruise, the navy guy.

2506
02:27:23,250 --> 02:27:27,520
Dude, you're not going to
seal. But you know, so I am.
When I watch a few good men,

2507
02:27:27,521 --> 02:27:31,670
I am with the marines all the way up until
they break their integrity. All right,

2508
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:33,480
which it's a movie, right? But,

2509
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,810
but under no circumstances should we
break our integrity and and that that's a

2510
02:27:37,811 --> 02:27:40,000
problem. They, you know,
that's, it's so false. No,

2511
02:27:40,001 --> 02:27:43,480
colonel would tell someone one thing,
then tell this junior guy over here, no,

2512
02:27:43,481 --> 02:27:45,670
you go do this and then lie
about and try and cover it up.

2513
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:50,230
Cover a good cover up number when they
break their integrity. That's, I don't,

2514
02:27:50,231 --> 02:27:52,630
I don't care what uniform you're wearing,
that that's a problem.

2515
02:27:52,720 --> 02:27:56,200
Or if you're not wearing a uniform at all
after we just talked about that on the

2516
02:27:56,201 --> 02:28:00,460
last podcast. Maintain the
integrity. It's true. Oh,

2517
02:28:00,580 --> 02:28:04,180
follow up question. Is there such
thing as a code red? No. Okay.

2518
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:08,590
There's no sense anyway.
So support, right.

2519
02:28:08,591 --> 02:28:12,600
We can talk about that if it was like
cool. Yeah, let's do it right now.

2520
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:16,540
All right, well, uh, and let's do it fast.

2521
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:18,700
We'll will speed it up here.

2522
02:28:18,860 --> 02:28:22,070
This top about on it supplements I
worked out today because he probably can

2523
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:25,920
tell. Yeah, you look, the pump
is on it. It's there. So on. Um,

2524
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:30,890
the name of the preworkout is
total strength and performance.

2525
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:35,330
I left out the strength in there,
so you perform good and is strong anyway.

You better order this one quick because
I don't think it's in print right now.

2537
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:19,980
And my mom bought off five copies.
My mother bought,

2538
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:23,240
I can't believe you've got one.
She must have resold that on Ebay.

2539
02:29:23,241 --> 02:29:27,200
Didn't realize she said
that to you. Yes. Yeah.

2540
02:29:27,220 --> 02:29:31,820
Bullies on Amazon though and you can buy
it should and in the event of you doing

2541
02:29:31,821 --> 02:29:35,750
that or buying anything else, um, and you
want to support the podcast by the way,

2545
02:29:47,540 --> 02:29:50,750

a good way. That's like small action,

2546
02:29:50,870 --> 02:29:55,840
big result like sodium in a, in a
fish tank is what we say, you know,

2547
02:29:57,820 --> 02:30:02,430

mood to sports, podcasts, also youtube,

2553
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:18,230

I noticed that shorter videos

2554
02:30:19,970 --> 02:30:23,150
Jocko. Good. That's one of the, the
Oji videos. That was a good one though,

02:30:29,601 --> 02:30:34,070
if you like little Jocko mcnuggets rather
than the whole podcast all at once.

2558
02:30:34,130 --> 02:30:38,600
Shareable, right. I say, Hey Brian
Stann watch this video real quick.

2559
02:30:38,630 --> 02:30:42,200
It's two hours long. You're not watching
it real quick. Three minutes long.

2560
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:45,020
You might watch that one real quick.
Absolutely. Same thing. Exactly right.

2561
02:30:45,021 --> 02:30:49,040
The same thing. So that's what we're
doing now. If he didn't know. So yeah,

2562
02:30:49,041 --> 02:30:52,370
subscribe to that. If you want to, um,
you know, you want to be updated on that.

2563
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:56,810
Also, Jocko has a store,
it's called Jocko store,

2564
02:30:58,260 --> 02:31:02,580
Jocko store.com. We think of original
names like that. Simple, but you know,

2565
02:31:02,670 --> 02:31:07,370
got still name like Jocko, why change
it up? Yeah. Yeah. It's perfect.

2566
02:31:07,790 --> 02:31:09,920
And you know, there's some
shirts on there, you know,

2567
02:31:09,921 --> 02:31:11,540
if you want to kind of
get after it that way,

2568
02:31:11,541 --> 02:31:14,270
get yourself a shirt that's kind of,
you know, you're wearing shirts anyway,

2569
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:19,190
I figure, right? Yeah. Why not
wear a Choco shirts anyways.

2570
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:20,010
Right,
exactly

2571
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:23,140
right. I agree with you make
of that and they're good.

2572
02:31:23,141 --> 02:31:27,020
That we kind of wait is this has to be
one discipline equals freedom. Yeah.

2573
02:31:27,050 --> 02:31:29,900
Discipline equals e. That's an
awesome shirt. There you go. See that?

2574
02:31:29,901 --> 02:31:33,930
That's an awesome shirt. Approved. If
there's a London wearing those shirts,

2575
02:31:33,931 --> 02:31:36,240
pretty legit doesn't,
I'll show you something like that.

2576
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:38,550
You know what you do just don't
want to wear the shirt. Yeah.

2577
02:31:38,970 --> 02:31:42,360
You want to go ahead and live the life
you've been in there for a discipline.

2578
02:31:42,410 --> 02:31:43,760
Like if you're going to do that,

2579
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:47,060
don't wake up at 10 30 in the morning and
roll out of bed on a city. No, no, no.

2580
02:31:47,470 --> 02:31:48,380
Go accomplish something.

2581
02:31:49,310 --> 02:31:53,390
Yup. Very well put. Yes. Um, so
yeah, check out those shirts.

2582
02:31:53,391 --> 02:31:54,470
I'm not saying buy a shirt,

2583
02:31:54,471 --> 02:31:57,490
I'm just saying I'm not sitting here and
saying buy a shirt. I'm saying go ahead.

2584
02:31:57,620 --> 02:31:59,990
Go on the website, junk
store.com. Look at the shirts.

2585
02:32:00,110 --> 02:32:03,440
If you like the shirts and you
want to support the podcast,

2586
02:32:04,730 --> 02:32:09,470
get a shirt, it's on you. Um, there's
some rash guards in there so you can,

2587
02:32:09,471 --> 02:32:13,790
you know, some, some physical
activity, grappling, surfing,

2588
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:15,710
crop, anything that, you know,

2589
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:18,830
eating thing that you do a lot of
physical activity in the range of motion.

2590
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:22,070
Rash guards, good hoodies, good patches,

2591
02:32:22,071 --> 02:32:26,480
good regulation size or not
regulations up. Good. All good. Anyway,

2592
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:30,450
what about these mugs, these mugs
better beyond there? Oh yeah, the mugs,

2593
02:32:30,550 --> 02:32:32,050
unfortunately.
Uh,

2594
02:32:32,450 --> 02:32:37,340
I got a bunch of them made and we sold
them on Amazon and we had a bunch in

2595
02:32:37,341 --> 02:32:40,490
stock and then Joe Rogan posted a picture
of his and then they were all gone.

2596
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:45,420
Then they're out of stock. I
got more common, got more kind,

2597
02:32:45,460 --> 02:32:49,460
a matte black early March.
I think I tweeted out before
we started the show, just,

2598
02:32:49,461 --> 02:32:51,560
just showed the desk with
all the weapons on it,

2599
02:32:51,890 --> 02:32:56,450
the amount of testosterone and
jawline in here, national capacity.

2600
02:32:58,830 --> 02:33:02,120
There's 30 feet and Jawline,
this office right now.

2601
02:33:03,290 --> 02:33:05,000
Uh,
yeah.

2602
02:33:05,380 --> 02:33:08,770
But yeah, those, I think what March, right
too. It was like, I think early March.

2603
02:33:08,771 --> 02:33:11,890
I think that will be available
for something like that
and still working on the

2604
02:33:11,891 --> 02:33:14,860
international for the mugs.
Right? Probably. So, hey,

2605
02:33:14,890 --> 02:33:18,720
we're going to make that happen.
So I'm stand by it for that. Also,

2606
02:33:18,721 --> 02:33:22,600
k psychological warfare, I like to feel,
sometimes I don't need to sit anymore,

2607
02:33:23,170 --> 02:33:27,190
I'm over it. But if you do
need psychological warfare
can't, here's what it is.

2608
02:33:28,810 --> 02:33:30,580
You ever have those
days where you're like,

2609
02:33:31,180 --> 02:33:35,500
you're about to work out or you have
planned to work up and you're like,

2610
02:33:35,520 --> 02:33:39,570
you know, maybe I'll just
work out tomorrow. Everybody
has the absolutely right.

2611
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,473
Yes.

2612
02:33:40,510 --> 02:33:45,250
So what you do is you get this
album that we put together,

2613
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:49,390
well, it's chocolate talking. I just
kind of recorded it. But like I said,

2614
02:33:49,480 --> 02:33:53,190
echo press record better than
anybody else. But it's true.

2615
02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:56,680
But it on iTunes you can get like a track.

2616
02:33:56,710 --> 02:34:00,460
Like if your thing is like I eat
donuts way too much and you're like,

2617
02:34:00,461 --> 02:34:02,860
I'm going to fight the donuts or whatever,
you can just get that track.

2618
02:34:02,861 --> 02:34:05,650
It's called what? Sugarcoated
lies. That's for example,

2619
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:10,830
Jockos voice telling you why not to
eat the donut. I love this. Essentially

2620
02:34:12,380 --> 02:34:17,020
you don't need to, your voice is so
stern and intense. It curse. It mattered.

2621
02:34:17,110 --> 02:34:18,010
Absolutely right.

2622
02:34:18,030 --> 02:34:21,590
Yeah. It's like Batman. Yeah, right.
No, I shouldn't Bale Batman personally.

2623
02:34:22,030 --> 02:34:26,370
Don't eat the donut. That's more leaf
leis is Batman horse. You're kind of like,

2624
02:34:26,980 --> 02:34:31,300
oh no, I'm working joke Joe
something. I Dunno. Either way.

2625
02:34:31,330 --> 02:34:34,210
There's a bunch of them though. It's cool.
Like Ted, wake up in the morning. What?

2626
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:38,950
Anyway, it's good man. It helps. It helps
a lot. I very well received. I think so.

2627
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:44,650
Yeah. I was kind of surprised that go
thought it was a good idea and oh man,

2628
02:34:44,651 --> 02:34:45,670
people need this.
I'm like,

2629
02:34:45,671 --> 02:34:50,671
people need two minutes of me talking
about don't I need it to go work out and

2630
02:34:52,061 --> 02:34:55,920
send me in. Like there's no way I
can sleep through cause we want them.

2631
02:34:56,080 --> 02:35:01,080
The first track is called wake up and
get after it because I think that really

2632
02:35:01,301 --> 02:35:04,330
one of the easiest ways to
start developing discipline
in your life is to wake

2633
02:35:04,331 --> 02:35:05,164
up early in the morning.

2634
02:35:05,470 --> 02:35:09,370
So the first track is wake up and get
after it and actually do it a count to 10

2635
02:35:09,550 --> 02:35:11,720
and give you the
opportunity 10 seconds fair.

2636
02:35:11,750 --> 02:35:14,530
And to get out of bed if not out of bed.
By then we've got issues.

2637
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:22,230
Crazy. It's, it's, it's, it's fun. Uh,

2638
02:35:23,170 --> 02:35:27,610
anything else along with that? If you
want to get some Jocko white tea. Yeah,

2639
02:35:27,611 --> 02:35:31,210
it's available. It's available and
in stock on Amazon. And you know,

2640
02:35:31,211 --> 02:35:33,370
before I was hesitant because
at one time I said, hey,

2641
02:35:33,371 --> 02:35:34,690
we'll never sell out of it again.

2642
02:35:35,410 --> 02:35:39,430
And everybody that listened as podcast
bought it that day and we sold out in 15

2643
02:35:39,431 --> 02:35:41,800
minutes cause we sold out the
first time and they're like, no,

2644
02:35:41,801 --> 02:35:44,770
I'm just gonna get a ton. I said, don't
worry, guys will never saw it again. Yeah,

2645
02:35:44,771 --> 02:35:49,240
we sold out again. Now I'm feeling pretty
confident that we won't sell it again.

2646
02:35:49,690 --> 02:35:51,400
If that means I went kind of Richter,

2647
02:35:52,270 --> 02:35:57,270
I over engineered the whole thing so we
shouldn't sell out of Jocko white tea

2648
02:35:57,371 --> 02:36:02,110
again. You can get it on amazon.com
international orders. Check Ebay.

2649
02:36:03,010 --> 02:36:06,550
When you're clicking on Amazon, get
this book right here by Brian. Stan.

2650
02:36:07,450 --> 02:36:10,450
Hard for the fight.
You heard him talking about it tonight.

2651
02:36:10,510 --> 02:36:12,910
I covered a tiny portion of the book.

2652
02:36:13,660 --> 02:36:17,170
Great information about combat,
