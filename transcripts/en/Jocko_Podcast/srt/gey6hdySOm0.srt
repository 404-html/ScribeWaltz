00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,550
This is Jocko podcast number
one 25 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,370
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,680
And we are bringing a Q and
a today. Sure. To the world.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,210
First question. Dang right
into it. Okay. All right.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,920
What is the difference between
an excuse and a reason?

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,330
Kind of a good question, right? Sure.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,780
Okay. And the reason it's a
good question because there's,

8
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,740
there can be legitimate reasons
why things happen. Yeah, right.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,510
And so for instance, you're in a,

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,790
in a sailing race,
right?

11
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,830
In a sailboat and the mast snaps in half.
Now you don't win the race,

12
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,450
but I mean you didn't, you
know, the mass snapped.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,560
What can you do about that?
Or the weather's horrible.

14
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,270
Weather rolls in and you
can't launch your aircraft.

15
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:04,140
So you can't go on your mission when you
can't control the weather. So you know,

16
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:07,830
like what's up? How can that, that's
a reason. Or you get really sick.

17
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:11,460
So you can't compete in a competition.
That's a reason.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,730
You know you were sick or you
do bad because you were sick.

19
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,450
And yet it's a reason
because we called her now.

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,250
Now you could look at the
situation and say, okay,

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,020
if I'm going to take ownership or this,
did I properly test the mast?

22
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:31,200
Sure. Did I, yeah. Let me ask you this.

23
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,470
Did we have a ground based plan for the
operation in case the weather came in,

24
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,460
we were going to take vehicles instead.
Hmm. Right. Yeah, that would work.

25
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,580
If you get sick before the competition,

26
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:49,350
maybe you ask yourself where
are you resting properly,
where you eating properly,

27
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,810
going into the competition
so you wouldn't get sick.

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,980
You could address that.
Correct.

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,180
So you can still take ownership of things.

30
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:03,390
Even if the initial reaction is like,
oh there's, you can't control that.

31
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,220
Well then you can influence it.
You can mitigate it right now.

32
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,150
Can there still be legitimate reasons?
Yes, there can. And for me, the,

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,720
the,
the difference,

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,050
the line between an excuse and a reason
is a reason you have zero control over,

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,710
right. You have Z, you just have zero
control over something happening.

36
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,544
Well that's a reason.

37
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,330
Did I tell you I was almost
late the other day for something

38
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,100
cause this is borderline.
This is borderline. Huh?

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,310
I had an appointment at 10 o'clock
I left is a 20 minute drive.

40
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,990
I left an hour. I left at,

41
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,130
well I left about nine 10 I left 50
minutes to drive 20 minutes just so gonna

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,243
make it on time.

43
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,340
I get on the road basically a couple of
roads out of my house and the one entry

44
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,850
way to get on the freeway is locked down.

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,280
Locked down, like incident, like
isolate some incident incident.

46
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:16,860
A guy trying to kill himself on a
bridge. Shut the road down. Yeah.

47
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,780
So no one's going on the highway.
So what does it,

48
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,430
everyone's being channelized into
marginal. What are they called?

49
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,640
Back side streets.
Dittos rerouted.

50
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,910
The clock is ticking and,

51
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,310
and I made it right. I made
it. I was four minutes.

52
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,700
I had four minutes to spare. So instead
of it taking 20 minutes, it took whatever,

53
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,310
46 minutes,
took more than twice as long

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,830
that that could be,
you know,

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,720
a fairly legitimate reason.
Now,

56
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,520
luckily I had, I always, you know,

57
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,790
I had planned that there
could be something out of
my control and it might take

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
even longer and that's why I leave early
to go to an appointment or situation

59
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,943
like that.

60
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,840
So I could have also checked the
traffic prior to leaving and taking a

61
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:14,680
completely different route. That
would have been, I blamed myself.

62
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:17,690
So even in that situation I'm kind of,
I was thinking the whole time, what,

63
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,380
why did, why didn't I check
the traffic before I left?

64
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,110
I knew this could have happened.
So anyways,

65
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,990
in my opinion and excuses,

66
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,490
when you blame something that you
could have controlled and a reason is

67
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:35,440
something that you have absolutely no
control over whatsoever know you think

68
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,770
like a legit disease. I mean sometimes
people have, they just don't,

69
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,760
you can't control that.
It happens. But I think,

70
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,230
and I think this is the important part,

71
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,260
I think that what you will
find as specially when you
approached the world with

72
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:53,950
an attitude of extreme ownership and
that's that you're not going to make any

73
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:54,920
excuses.
You're not going to name it.

74
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,710
[inaudible] is that you actually have
a lot more control over things then you

75
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,150
think you do.
We've talked about this before.

76
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,870
When I go to the airport,

77
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,640
I get there really early because it's
something that you have no control over.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,090
You're going to stand in that TSA line
and those people are going to take

79
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,240
forever and that's the way it is.
And if you want to get mad at them,

80
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,250
it doesn't matter. You can't, you can't
control, you cannot control it in any way.

81
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,670
You can stand at the back of my flight's
leaving in 30 minutes and there'll be

82
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,430
like, whatever. You should have showed
up earlier. You can't control it.

83
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:33,130
So in those situations, how do
you control it? You show up early,

84
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:36,400
you take ownership of it, you
show up early. You don't just, Oh,

85
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,030
I don't know what happened. The
traffic was bad. I mean it's,

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,480
there's a million excuses you can give.

87
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,190
If you get that attitude where
you're not going to make excuses,

88
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,880
you'll actually take ownership of the
things and then you'll actually solve

89
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,140
problems before they even happen.

90
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,460
If I'm going to an appointment and I have
the excuse of my back of my head that

91
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,470
you know what, if I'm late, I'll
just say it was the traffic.

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,880
I been much more increased
chance of being late. Yeah.

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah.

94
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,700
All right. So what's what, that's,

95
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,790
that's one of the things that makes
extreme ownership or hard is it hurts your

96
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,160
ego.
It hurts your ego.

97
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,190
It hurts your ego to admit that you have
control over things that went wrong.

98
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,140
That's that there.
It's your fault that hurts your ego.

99
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,083
Hmm.

100
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,350
It's also effective because of that.
It's effective because you solve problems.

101
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,700
Like I said before,
they even happen.

102
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,590
You solve them because you
take ownership of them.

103
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,310
Yeah.
Amen.

104
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,590
But isn't this just a
bunch of semantics though?

105
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,910
Like excuses and reasons re cause
really when it comes down to it,

106
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,500
excuse is like an excuse.
Like you're excused.

107
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,980
Like the reason is a reason for sure.
But it's like,

108
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,640
well, that's what this
whole conversation, yes,

109
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,360
it is about semantics and the semantics
are for me and excuse to something that

110
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:54,480
you could have controlled and a reason
is something that you could not control.

111
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,560
Aren't they all reasons. So
it's up to, I mean, again,

112
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,200
did you say tomato? I say to, I get it,

113
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,250
but come on and you brought
it up so you can, okay.

114
00:07:05,251 --> 00:07:09,270
So I remember when I was in
elementary school. You get,

115
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,120
you come late to school,
you get in trouble.
