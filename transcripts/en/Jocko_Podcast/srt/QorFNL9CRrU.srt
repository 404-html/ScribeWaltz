1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,840
This is Jocko podcast number
16 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,613
We,

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,100
yeah,

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,110
we couldn't have been more excited.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,830
It was a real mission.

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,220
None of us had been on a real mission
before except for our l p o r,

8
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,320
which is our leading petty officer
who is in the fall, first Gulf War,

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,950
and our platoon commander who was in on
the Grenada invasion and fired at the

10
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:49,310
radio tower. Those guys had this
small amount of combat experience,

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,660
but at the time,
for us,

12
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:54,800
that was a world apart from what we
had because the rest of us had zero.

13
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:58,010
This was the 90s there
was no war going on.

14
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:04,540
And so now here we were
with a real mission on deck
1994 I think I was about 23

15
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:13,010
years old. I'm in my second
seal platoon and at the time,

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,870
being in a seal platoon was literally
the sole purpose and focus of my life.

17
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:28,230
It was my whole world and that's what
most of my platoon mates were like as

18
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:33,170
well. That's, that's, that's what we were.

19
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,980
And this was an awesome platoon.

20
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:38,870
A great to the Arg Alpha platoon.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,300
Yeah,

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,830
and as far as having tight friends
in a brotherhood inside of a platoon,

23
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:49,850
this was definitely one of
the best that I was ever in,

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,780
if not the best in all of us,

25
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:58,070
were just a hundred percent about being
in a seal platoon and it was the world

26
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:03,020
to us and we didn't care about,
we care about anything else really.

27
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,730
Not Politics, domestic politics
or international politics.

28
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,430
We weren't sitting around and reading
newspapers and we barely even watch the

29
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:18,200
news at this time. We were deployed
on a ship. There was no internet.

30
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,940
We were, we were troopers. You know,

31
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:27,530
we were errand boys as Colonel
Kurtz says in apocalypse now.

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,810
We didn't know about the policy,

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,460
but we sure as hell would enforce it.

34
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,180
It's w we had this mission and we
were fired up. We were, like I said,

35
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:45,181
we were on a ship and we were off the
coast of Africa when there was something

36
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,020
going on in one of the countries there.

37
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,000
And during the last deployment
that seals did on a ship.

38
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:58,960
At this time, it was some of our fellow
seals guys that we knew had gone into.

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,330
And so that was a real mission and we
kind of thought maybe this'll be our

40
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:08,830
opportunity. And probably seven
or eight months prior to this,

41
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:11,480
the battle of Mogadishu had
taken place, which is, you know,

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,430
where the movie Black Hawk down came
from. So this was, this was Africa,

43
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,730
this was like our chance to
get into some kind of combat.

44
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,570
Okay.

45
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,710
And we started hearing more about the
situation where they might send us,

46
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,100
it looked like we're going to go in and
provide some kind of security and it

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,040
looked like we're going to go in and
maybe help some Americans that were there

48
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:34,791
and get them out.

49
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:38,540
And then it looked like we might go in
and reinforce some kind of UN troops and

50
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,520
like a bunch of missions.

51
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:45,521
And they kind of changed as the situation
developed and in we started reading

52
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:48,330
about what was happening and what we're
going to be going to do and in what,

53
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:52,280
what the situation was
there on the ground. And I,

54
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,710
I didn't understand it at first.

55
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,860
Okay.

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,130
But there was people killing each other

57
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,020
by the thousands.

58
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,860
By the tens of thousands.

59
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,060
By the hundreds of thousands,

60
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,430
hundreds of thousands of people were
being killed. But it wasn't like, oh,

61
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:20,720
it wasn't like a war that you know,

62
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,150
I had read about or
I'd seen in the movies.

63
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,300
They weren't shooting each other with
guns or dropping bombs on each other.

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,680
They were big week using machetes,

65
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,220
let go like a horror movie.

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,090
Hundreds,

67
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,850
hundreds of thousands of
people being butchered.

68
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,760
And what was it all about?

69
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,590
It was a tribal difference that's
barely distinguishable to us.

70
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,560
I mean,
it's barely distinguishable for them.

71
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,500
The country was Rwanda

72
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:13,090
and the event came to be
known as the Rwandan genocide,

73
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,380
a mass murder,

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,040
primarily of Tootie tribesmen
by the rival who to clan

75
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,700
now war

76
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,443
it

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,250
or something that I can rationalize,
right?

78
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,010
Maybe I shouldn't be able to
do that, but I can. I mean,

79
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,210
there's some kind of wrong or evil in
the world that needs to be stood up

80
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:48,190
against. You know, is it fascism?
Is it tyranny? Is it terrorism?

81
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,290
It's forces of darkness

82
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,410
and they're pitted against forces of
light forces of freedom and democracy.

83
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,040
And as I say all the time,

84
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:07,730
war is hell and it should be a last
resort when everything else has failed.

85
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,150
And that being said,

86
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:18,420
war is necessary sometimes to stop evil
and sometimes it's the only way to stop

87
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,210
evil.
But this,

88
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,940
this idea here,

89
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:32,960
this situation where people
are killing each other

90
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,630
in a mob type scenario and they're
literally doing it like a horror movie.

91
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,920
I don't know how else to explain it.

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,120
It's like a horror movie that
seems to insane and to bloody,

93
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:47,770
to even be believable.

94
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,820
You take the worst horror movie you
can imagine with the worst plotline,

95
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,450
and this makes less sense.

96
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,620
It wouldn't even be believable if it
was a horror movie. It's too much.

97
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,160
It's too violent and too ruthless.

98
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,450
And there's too much to even
comprehend or understand

99
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,720
in this is,
I mean,

100
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,750
I hope that this is somewhere at the limit

101
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:36,210
of the evil that human
beings are capable of

102
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,343
you.

103
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,530
You hear me talk about the darkness,

104
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,600
the evil in the world.

105
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,870
Well,
this is it.

106
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,850
Yeah.
I'm going to the book now.

107
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,780
The book is called machete season.

108
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,340
Okay.

109
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,100
The killers in Rwanda speak.

110
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,953
Okay.

111
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,460
During that killing season,

112
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,300
we rose earlier than
usual to eat lots of meat.

113
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,900
We went up to the soccer field at
around nine or 10 we would go off on the

114
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:35,070
attack.
Rule number one was to kill.

115
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,950
There was no rule number two,

116
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,300
it was an organization
without complications.

117
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,420
The judge told everyone,

118
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:51,350
everyone there that from then on we
were to do nothing but killed Tutsis.

119
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,660
Well,
we understood that was a final plan.

120
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,710
The killing of every
Tutsi without exception.

121
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,210
It was simply said and it
was simple to understand.

122
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,803
Okay.

123
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,390
There were some who asked if
there were any priorities.

124
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,460
The judge answered sternly.
There is no need to ask how to begin.

125
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,210
The only worthwhile plan is to start
straight ahead into the bush and right now

126
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,710
without hanging back behind.
Any more questions.

127
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,610
When you get right down to it,

128
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,320
it is a gross exaggeration to
say we organized ourselves.

129
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,230
The killings began without much planning.

130
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,590
The only regulation was to
keep going till the end,

131
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,690
maintain a satisfactory pace.

132
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,780
Spare no one and loot what we found
it was impossible to screw up.

133
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,590
And that's one of the craziest
things about this book. Again,

134
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:03,760
the book is called machete season.
It's the killers in Rwanda speak.

135
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,860
So this author

136
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,020
John Heads Fouled.

137
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,420
He went into the prison where these
people are now being kept to talk to them

138
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,180
about what they did and
it's their own words.

139
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,963
Okay.

140
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,440
In the preface to the book, just to
give you a little bit of background,

141
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,790
ours is appallingly an age of genocide,

142
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,360
but even so what happened in Rwanda in
the spring of 1994 stands out in several

143
00:10:37,581 --> 00:10:41,290
ways in a tiny landlocked African country,

144
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,010
smaller than the state of Maryland,

145
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,700
some 800,000 people or hacked to death,

146
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,710
one by one by their neighbors.
The women,

147
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,110
men and children core slaughtered.

148
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,300
We're of the same race and shared the
same language, customs and confession.

149
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,900
They were Roman Catholic as those
who eagerly slaughtered them.

150
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,123
And I'll tell you,

151
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,680
I was seriously considering
not doing this podcast.

152
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,660
And in
this book,

153
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,040
Sam Harris,

154
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,040
acquaintance of mine who does podcasts,
who I was on his podcast,

155
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,860
very smart guy, brilliant
guy, and you know,

156
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:40,240
he sent me an email and said,
hey Jocko, check out this book.

157
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,990
And you know,
he said it's about the Rwandan genocide.

158
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,900
And I immediately said, hey,
you know, I was, I was there.

159
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,450
I mean it wasn't on the ground,
but we were there waiting to go in.

160
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:56,290
So I immediately what he was
talking about, and he's, you know,

161
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,810
he's basically said it's by the killers.

162
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,120
And so I immediately ordered it on
Amazon and as soon as I got it and I just

163
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:11,610
read it. And at first I was excited.
You don't think all this is really,

164
00:12:11,611 --> 00:12:14,670
this is going to be impactful.
But as I went deeper and deeper into it,

165
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:18,300
I started saying to myself,
maybe I don't do this podcast.

166
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,930
Maybe I don't do it.
Because like I said, it's,

167
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,140
it's almost too much.
I think it is too much.

168
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,233
Okay.

169
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,520
And for that very reason,

170
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,240
I'm going to do it because we,

171
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,130
we can't,
we,

172
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,310
we must not deny that evil exists
and that humans can be evil.

173
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,473
Yeah.

174
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,240
And as the pre of the book continues,

175
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,240
our obligation,
and it is an obligation,

176
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,640
is to take what human beings are
capable of doing to one another.

177
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,870
Not spontaneously crimes of
this order on never spontaneous,

178
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,320
but when mobilized to think
of other human beings,

179
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,040
people who were their school friends,
neighbors,

180
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:23,070
coworkers and fellow parishioners
as not human beings at all.

181
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,490
Yeah.

182
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:28,180
And when organized for and
directed to the task of slaughter

183
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,860
for the issue finally is not judgment.
It is understanding

184
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,910
to make the effort to understand what
happened in Rwanda is a painful task that

185
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:45,040
we have no right to shirk.

186
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,360
It is part of being a moral adult.

187
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,890
So now let's listen to these

188
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,203
people

189
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,830
then that might be a stretch, but let's
listen to what these people had to say

190
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,720
at the beginning.
We were too fired up to think later on.

191
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,270
We were too used to it in our condition.

192
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,170
It meant nothing to us to think we were
busy cutting our neighbor's down to the

193
00:14:19,171 --> 00:14:22,950
last one.
It became a goes without saying.

194
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,610
They had already stopped being
good neighbors of longstanding.

195
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,160
The ones who handed around the or Waga

196
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,090
can at the cabaret or Raga was like a B,
it's a banana beer.

197
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,880
Since they wouldn't be there anymore,
they'd become people to throw away,

198
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,780
so to speak.

199
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,490
They were no longer what they
had been and neither were we

200
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:47,980
okay.

201
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,980
They did not bother us and the past did
not bother us because nothing bothered

202
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:54,044
us

203
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,780
and so the Tutsis were driven immediately.

204
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:03,010
They tried to escape to this area
that they called the marshes,

205
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,720
which are outside, you know, the hills,

206
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:07,720
but people lived in the hills and
they tried to escape the mart.

207
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,520
Did the Tutsis tried to escape to the
marshes and another one of the murderers

208
00:15:12,521 --> 00:15:16,180
says kindness too,
was forbidden in the marshes.

209
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,290
The marshes left no room for
exceptions to forget doubt.

210
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,710
We had meanness and ruthless
and the ruthlessness in
killing and a job to do and

211
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,960
do well.
That's all.

212
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,920
Some changed color from the hunting.
Their limbs were muddy.

213
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
There clothes were splattered.

214
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,160
Even their faces were not black in
the same way they became grayish from

215
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:42,450
everything that he had done.

216
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,640
A little layer of stink covered us too,
but we didn't care.

217
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:53,160
We no longer saw a human being when
we turned up a Tutsi in the swamps.

218
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,410
I mean a person like us sharing
similar thoughts and feelings.

219
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,310
The hunt was savage.
The hunters were savage.

220
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,720
The prey was savage.
Savitri took over the mind.

221
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,063
Yeah.

222
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:18,990
The more we killed the more
greediness urged us on greediness.

223
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,860
If left on punished,
it never lets you go.

224
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,910
You could see it in our eyes
bugged out by the killings.

225
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,640
It would even danger some.

226
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,960
There were those that came back in the
bloodstain shirts brandishing their

227
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:38,950
machetes, shrieking like madmen
saying they wanted to grab everything.

228
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,970
We had to calm them down with drinks and
soothing words because they could turn

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,950
ugly for those around them.

230
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,380
Man can get used to killing
if he kills on and on.

231
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,250
He can even become a
beast without noticing it.

232
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,320
Some threatened one another when they
had no more Tutsis under the machete in

233
00:16:59,321 --> 00:17:02,650
their faces.
You could see the need to kill

234
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:05,350
me.

235
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,270
I was not scared of death in a way
I forgot it was killing live people.

236
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,260
I no longer thought about
either life or death,

237
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,890
but the blood struck terror and to
me it stank and dripped at night.

238
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:24,310
I tell myself after all,
I am a man full of blood,

239
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,490
all this spurting blood
will bring me catastrophe.

240
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,120
A curse death did not alarm me,

241
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,280
but that overflow of blood that yes,
a lot

242
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,970
in one of the things that
they talk about in the book,

243
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,490
please in this,
in this part of of continent,

244
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,890
the people, they use a machete for
everything, so they, they do there,

245
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,250
they cut down brush with it. They
slaughter the animals with it. They,

246
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,250
they cook their dinners with it.
They do everything with a machete,

247
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,560
so everybody's just sort of, it's, it's
there, it's there, it's there. Iphone,

248
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:13,760
right. It's their iPhone. They,
everyone has, it's their smartphone.

249
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,540
That's what they use for everything like
we do in America. We use a smart phone.

250
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,730
They use a machete for everything.
That's how they get their food.

251
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,770
That's how they clear out their
house to how they build. I mean,

252
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,480
it's everything they do.
They do with the marriage too,

253
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,490
so everyone's very
comfortable with a machete,

254
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,380
a boy with the strength in his
arms to hold the machete firmly.

255
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,000
If his brother or father brought him
along in the group he imitated and grew

256
00:18:40,001 --> 00:18:43,630
used to killing youth,
no longer hampered him.

257
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:49,030
He became accustomed to blood
killing became an ordinary activity.

258
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,370
Since our elders and everyone did it,

259
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,320
or a young boy might even prove more at
ease with it than an experienced oldster

260
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,580
because deaf touched him farther away.

261
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,630
Given the novelty of the
circumstances and his young age,

262
00:19:07,631 --> 00:19:09,430
death seemed less important to him.

263
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,570
He saw it as belonging
to an older generation.

264
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,830
He shrugged off its perils and
considered it a distraction.

265
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,790
It became a madness that
went on all by itself.

266
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,860
You raced ahead or you got out
of the way to escaping, run over,

267
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,390
but you followed the crowd.
The one who rushed off,

268
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:41,840
machete and hand,
he listened to nothing anymore.

269
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,600
He forgot everything.
First of all,

270
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,700
his level of intelligence doing
the same thing every day. Men,

271
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,860
we didn't have to think
about what we were doing.

272
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,190
We went out and came back
without having a single thought.

273
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,050
We hunted because it was the order
of the day until the day was over.

274
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:04,100
Our arms ruled our heads.
In any case,

275
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,470
our heads no longer had their say.

276
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,210
We became more and more cruel,
more and more calm,

277
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,740
more and more bloody.

278
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,450
But we did not see that we were
becoming more and more killers.

279
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,610
The more we cut,

280
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,740
the more cutting became
child's play to us for a few.

281
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,310
It turned into treat,
if I may say so.

282
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,180
That's one of the things
they do is they use some,

283
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,620
some words like cut and what they
mean is slaughter and murder,

284
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,500
but they use kind of a term
that's less drag as a euphemism.

285
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:48,483
Hmm.

286
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,290
At the start of the killings,

287
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,350
we worked fast and skimmed along because
we were eager in the middle of the

288
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,880
killings.
We killed casually.

289
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,120
We killed to keep the job going.

290
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,600
Some we're tired of
these blood assignments.

291
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,720
Others amuse themselves by torturing
Tutsis who had made them sweat day after

292
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,624
day.

293
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,530
Since I was killing often,

294
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,210
I began to feel it did not mean
anything to me. It gave me no pleasure.

295
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:31,650
I knew I would not be punished.
I was killing without consequences.

296
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,420
I adapted without a problem.

297
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,540
I left every morning free and
easy in a hurry to get going.

298
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,610
I saw that the work and the results
were good for me. That's all

299
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,760
during the killings.

300
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,820
I no longer considered anything in
particular in the Tutsi except that the

301
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,750
person had to be done away with.

302
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,980
I want to make it clear that from the
first gentleman I'd killed to the last,

303
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:05,040
I was not sorry about a single one.

304
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,463
Okay.

305
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,590
Now,
as I said,

306
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:24,591
it was difficult for to
to to tell who's who.

307
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,530
Right? They had the same culture.
They had the same language.

308
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:33,531
They look the same and you might be
wondering how did they know who was who?

309
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:40,620
Well, the author explains that
somewhat here and it is just,

310
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,770
well, I'll go to the
book after the genocide.

311
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,850
Many foreigners,

312
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:54,851
a wondered how the huge number of Hutu
killers recognize their tootsie victims

313
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,880
in the upheaval of the massacres since
Rwandans have both ethnic groups speak

314
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:06,560
the same language with no distinctive
differences live in the same places and

315
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:11,330
are not always physically recognizable
by distinctive characteristics.

316
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,270
The answer is simple.

317
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,420
The killers did not have to pick out
their victims. They knew them personally.

318
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,660
Everyone knows everything in the village,

319
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,620
so they didn't have to guess.

320
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:35,540
They didn't have to identify him by a
different skin color or by a different

321
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:39,620
facial structure or by different language.

322
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,360
They knew them.

323
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,240
A teacher and a survivor
of the marshes confirms.

324
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,103
Okay.

325
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,200
The principal and the inspector of
schools in my district participated in the

326
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:06,610
killings with nails,
studded clubs, teachers,

327
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,210
priests, the Burgo Master, a sub profit,

328
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:15,940
a doctor,
they all killed with their own hands.

329
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,440
They were pressed cotton trousers.
They had no trouble sleeping.

330
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,620
They traveled around and
vehicles wrong light motorcycles.

331
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,150
These well educated people were calm and
they rolled up their sleeves to get a

332
00:24:28,151 --> 00:24:29,980
good grip on their machetes.

333
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:36,730
For someone who has spent his life
teaching the humanities as I have.

334
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,270
Such criminals are a fearful mystery.

335
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,060
So like the, the priests, the, the,

336
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,880
the burger master, which is
like a kind of a German name of,

337
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:55,870
uh,
of someone that's a political person,

338
00:24:55,871 --> 00:25:00,610
political magistrate in a town or a
sub prefect. That's a sub prefect.

339
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:03,570
As someone that's in command,
someone of authority,

340
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,080
especially in the Catholic church.

341
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,800
So these people with their nice shirts
and nice pants were rolling up their

342
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:15,970
sleeves to get a good grip
on their machetes. At first,

343
00:25:15,971 --> 00:25:20,650
the killing was obligate Tori.
Afterward we got used to it.

344
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,890
We became naturally cruel.

345
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:30,030
We no longer needed encouragements or
fines to kill or even orders or advice.

346
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,190
Discipline was relaxed because
it wasn't necessary anymore.

347
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,970
I don't know anyone who was
struck because he refused to kill.

348
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,250
I know of one case of punishment
by death, a special case, a woman.

349
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,630
Some people caught her to punish
her husband who had refused to kill,

350
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,610
but she was in fact a Tutsi
afterward.

351
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:01,870
The husband took part without whining.
In fact,

352
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,700
he was one of the busiest in the marshes.
So these tribal,

353
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,850
the though the Hutus and the Tutsis
would marry each other. I'm just like,

354
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:13,300
you know, you put human beings
living in the same village, you know,

355
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,050
you end up marrying somebody
from the other tribe

356
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,930
and if you didn't go with the system,
you are getting murdered.

357
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,640
In the evening we had to report to the
leader about exactly what we had killed.

358
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,730
Many boasted for fear of
being taunted or frowned on.

359
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,960
That was also a good reason
why we did not bury the bodies.

360
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,740
Someone suspected of faking could
guide the verifiers to the truth.

361
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,713
Okay.

362
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,950
Anyone who had the idea of not killing
for a day could get out of it, no problem.

363
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,610
But anyone with the idea of not killing
it all could not let on or he himself

364
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:07,951
would be killed while there's watched
voicing disagreement out loud was fatal on

365
00:27:09,141 --> 00:27:09,974
the spot.

366
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,260
Okay.

367
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,510
So we don't know if people had that idea.

368
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,200
Okay.

369
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,960
In the evening after the killings,

370
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,790
there was time for friendship and
meeting friends brought us light hearts.

371
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,360
We would chat about our days.
We share drinks, we ate.

372
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,660
We no longer counted
up what we had killed.

373
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:31,830
Yeah.

374
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,170
But what it was that it would bring us,

375
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,220
the killings had made
us gossipy and greedy.

376
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,990
So that's one of the things that drove
was they get to use you or kill a family.

377
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:45,240
You take whatever you want from them,
including their land,

378
00:27:45,241 --> 00:27:46,880
including all their property,
everything.

379
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,903
Hmm.

380
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,770
So that's what they talk about. And
they become, they become greedy.

381
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:55,803
Okay.

382
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,270
And then at a certain point,

383
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:00,660
the authorities no longer had the
ability to plan or to channel.

384
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,240
Their orders fell on deaf ears.

385
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,200
The massacres had become
extraordinary beyond all reason.

386
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,510
The keenest ones, when they killed
the grab the possessions of the dead,

387
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,160
they wanted everything right away. Not
even stopping to finish off their victims.

388
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,380
The looting excited them so much.
They needed no advice or encouragement.

389
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,090
Their greed spread to those who followed,
who went crazy and turn.

390
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:37,400
We began the day by killing.
We ended the day by looting.

391
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,850
It was the rule to kill going out.
And Luke coming back,

392
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,700
we killed in teams,

393
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,830
but we alluded every man for himself
or in small groups of friends,

394
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,550
those who killed a lot
had less time to pillage.

395
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,040
But since they were feared,

396
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,820
they would catch up
because of their power.

397
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,860
So Hey, if I go out and kill
the most people, I don't
have that much time to loot.

398
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,360
That's okay cause everyone's scared of
me. Yeah. So they kind of let you, yeah.

399
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,810
Some killers claimed girls in the
marshes that satisfied them and made them

400
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:30,970
neglect, looting. They figured
they'd catch up the next day.

401
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:38,210
Now here's a, again, this
is going back to the,

402
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,520
the author does not direct quotes from,
from the killers,

403
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:47,521
but the authors kind of telling a
story about a situation that happened.

404
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,290
Um,

405
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,290
one of the murderers witnessed
the passage of armored cars.

406
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,680
So the international community community
likeyeah you heard me talking about the

407
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:04,240
fact that I was on a ship with seals with
marines that could have done something

408
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:06,010
here, but we didn't do
anything. I actually,

409
00:30:06,011 --> 00:30:08,560
the marines went in and provided
a little tiny bit of aid.

410
00:30:08,561 --> 00:30:11,680
I think they sent 30 guys in,
but it would nothing,

411
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,970
nothing to what did did. He had, you
know, a very minimalistic impact,

412
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,280
but what happened was
civilized people left

413
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:24,423
and

414
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,000
okay,

415
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,110
so they see armored cars
coming and they caused it here.

416
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,130
Now this is going to one of the killers
talking. They caused a big panic among,

417
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,720
among us who are already
roving in the streets,

418
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,070
heating themselves up with sudden
burst of gunfire. Some of them shouted,

419
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,190
the whites are here, others will
come. They have terrible weapons.

420
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:44,810
It's all over for us.

421
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,880
When they saw the convoy disappear in
the dust without even a little stop for

422
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,730
curiosity or a drink on the main street,

423
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,270
they celebrated with some Primus,

424
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:59,120
which is getting alcohol and shot off the
cartridges and their guns is a sign of

425
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:02,780
relief.
You could see they felt saved.

426
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,640
They will rid of the last stumbling block,
so to speak.

427
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,660
At the same time in Kigali,

428
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:16,100
which is the capitol whites were
leaving the embassies, offices,

429
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,140
monasteries and universities via road
convoys to neighboring countries and an

430
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,850
emergency airlift operating
out of the airport.

431
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,250
Okay.

432
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,450
Very few foreigners sought.

433
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,800
Refugee sought refuge in guarded villas,

434
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,750
but no foreigners were left.

435
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,800
And now this is again,
this is the commentary from the author,

436
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,440
not one foreigner, priest,
service corps, volunteer,

437
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,170
diplomat,
NGO worker.

438
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,950
None can provide a convincing reason for
this immediate and astonishing flight

439
00:31:57,171 --> 00:32:01,670
during the opening hours of the killings.
In any case,

440
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,420
neither danger nor panic
can justify such haste.

441
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,410
The most telling explanation I've
heard so far comes from Claudine.

442
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,580
You stay a farmer and soup
and survivor on the hill.

443
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,550
When she says reversing our proverb,

444
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:24,500
whites do not want to see
what they cannot believe.

445
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:30,310
And they could not believe a genocide
because that is a killing that overwhelms

446
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:34,820
everyone.
Them as much as the others.

447
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,430
Okay.

448
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,320
And so they left?

449
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,443
No.

450
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,840
The thing that sparked this,
there was a, there was a leader,

451
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,380
so there've been,

452
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,980
there'd been revolutionary or right
as civil war going on and it was used,

453
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:04,720
the Rwandan civil war had been going
on and it was between the Hutu led

454
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:09,430
government and the Rwandan
Patriotic Front or the RPF.

455
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,060
And so the,

456
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:16,070
the RPF was largely composed of Tutsis
and a lot of them had fled to Uganda,

457
00:33:17,651 --> 00:33:20,230
but now they were saying,
hey, let's go back.

458
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,060
And there was a bunch of pressure,
international pressure on the,

459
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,560
on the government,

460
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,010
which was led by the president
of Rwanda named Hobby Ari Mana.

461
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:40,290
So Habyarimana felt all this
pressure and so they made peace.

462
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,160
And then what happened was on April 6th,
1994,

463
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,710
an airplane that had,
um,

464
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,800
Habyarimana in,
it was shot down and everyone was killed,

465
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:58,390
including him. And that was it. So
the Hutu president was killed, the,

466
00:33:58,391 --> 00:34:01,020
his aircraft was shot
down and that was it. Um,

467
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,720
and I pulled this little
paragraph here from Wikipedia.

468
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,250
Genocidal killings began
the following day. Soldiers,

469
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,280
police and militia quickly executed
key Tutsi and moderate who two leaders.

470
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,760
So they were just getting after it,

471
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,330
then erected checkpoints and
barricades and use Rwandans,

472
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:22,930
national identity identity cards
to systematically killed Tutsis.

473
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,910
So in the 30s,

474
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,350
they had implemented this system where
you would put whatever tribe you were in

475
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,210
because it was so hard
to tell who was who.

476
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,050
And they just use those
identification cards.

477
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,700
These forces recruited or pressured
who to civilians to arm themselves with

478
00:34:43,701 --> 00:34:46,700
machetes, clubs, blunt objects
and other weapons to rape,

479
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:50,720
maim and kill their tootsie neighbors
and to destroy or steal their property.

480
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:54,400
But

481
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,233
one of the,

482
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,260
one of the major influences
on the people was radio.

483
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:09,040
It was radio.
And as leading up to this,

484
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,270
you had this situation where they
were broadcasting sort of I guess,

485
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,650
I guess it's what we call hate speech,
you know, that's what we call it only.

486
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:25,651
This was actual hate speech going to
the book in the broadcast studios of

487
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:29,080
popular radio stations,
Radio Rwanda,

488
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,990
the Tutsis were referred to
as cockroaches, announcers,

489
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:40,350
the two best known whom were Simon Bikini
and Contano used humorous sketches and

490
00:35:44,191 --> 00:35:47,760
songs to call openly for the
destruction of the Tutsis.

491
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,660
One of the, one of the killers
remembers those Gen and actually this,

492
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,510
this guy was a, yeah, he
was one of the killers.

493
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,650
Those gentlemen were famous
artists and great comic virtuosos.

494
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,780
What they said was so cleverly put and
repeated so office often that Tutsis

495
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:09,180
themselves found them funny to listen to.

496
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,500
They were clamoring for the massacre
of all the cockroaches, buttoned,

497
00:36:13,501 --> 00:36:18,480
amusing ways. And for the Tutsis,
those weedy words were hilarious.

498
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:20,310
So they're actually hearing
this and laughing about it.

499
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,770
The songs urging all Hutus to get
together to wipe out the Tutsis.

500
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,560
We laughed out loud at the jokes.

501
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:30,760
Okay.

502
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,500
And they made this who to 10 commandments,
which is basically,

503
00:36:35,501 --> 00:36:37,540
it's a document.
You look it up on Wikipedia.

504
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:41,500
It's just a document that's the 10
commandments. If you marry a Tutsi woman,

505
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,390
she should be killed.
She's, I mean, it's brutal.

506
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,493
Hmm.

507
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,960
Absolutely brutal.

508
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,073
And now

509
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,130
this is,
this is,

510
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,243
yeah.

511
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:01,100
I found this piece fascinating.
Continuing to talk about the,

512
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,160
the radio.
And

513
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,530
this is,
this is a statement,

514
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,280
and this is interesting because we're
on a podcast and I listened to podcasts

515
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,660
and I've, I haven't talked about
this before, but when I was a kid,

516
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,810
I listened to radio shows and
I understood the power of them.

517
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,440
I listened to a radio show and I'll
have to look and see where it is now.

518
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,170
It was called the Dr Demento show.

519
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,300
And the Dr Demento show was this,
it was on like Sunday nights,

520
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:43,260
10 o'clock on some college
radio station in New England,

521
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,980
and it would just have various,
it was like a variety show, right?

522
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,360
And they'd have a comedic part and there'd
be like a twilight zone type thing.

523
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,290
But I would sit there like
we do with podcasts now,

524
00:37:55,291 --> 00:37:59,040
and I'd put the head phones on and I'd
get in the zone and I would listen.

525
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,070
And you realize, and you realize
this, when you get into a podcast,

526
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,550
you realize there's a certain power to it.

527
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:13,850
There is a certain power to listening
to a person and their voice going into

528
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:20,370
your head. And there's a, there's a,

529
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,640
a piece about this inside the
book and it just nailed me.

530
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:30,330
It's, it's a remark made
by surge Dany who was, uh,

531
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,110
an SAS and he's talking
about the first Gulf War.

532
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,250
But what he says about radio,

533
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:40,900
and he would be obviously
saying this about podcasts now,

534
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,930
is that radio is far and away
the most dangerous of the media.

535
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,723
Yeah.

536
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,060
It wields a unique and terrifying power.

537
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,590
Once the state or an
institutional apparatus collapses,

538
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:04,030
it casts off everything that might
attenuate or sidetrack the force of words.

539
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,900
In a chaotic situation,

540
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:14,080
radio can prove to be the most efficient
tool of democracy as well as of

541
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:20,021
revolution or fascism because it
penetrates unhindered to the individual's

542
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:26,501
deepest core anywhere and at any moment
immediately without the necessary and

543
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:35,411
critical distance inherent in the
reading of a text or an image.

544
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,640
So when you listened to a podcast,

545
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:46,641
that's such a great note to explain
why radio has so much power.

546
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:52,530
You don't even have to
interpret the words. You don't
have to interpret an image.

547
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,810
The words are going into your head.

548
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:55,903
Mm.

549
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,740
And they use it.

550
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,700
They use it in situations like this.

551
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,630
And one of the killers said
ever since the plane crash,

552
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,310
so ever since the president was shot down,
the radio head hammered at us.

553
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,940
The foreigners are departing,
they had material,

554
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:20,941
the proof of what we are going to do
and they are leaving this time around.

555
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,660
They are showing no interest
in the fate of the Tutsis.

556
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,780
We witnessed that flight of the armored
cars along the road with our own eyes.

557
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:36,710
Our ears no longer heard
murmurs of repo of reproach.

558
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:39,610
For the first time ever,

559
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,110
we did not feel we were under the
frowning supervision of the whites.

560
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:50,860
Other encouragements followed that assured
us of unchecked freedom to complete

561
00:40:52,431 --> 00:40:57,330
the task. So we thought good. It's true.

562
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,850
The blue helmets did nothing except
an about face to leave us alone.

563
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:07,470
And if you don't know what blue helmets
are when you're working as a United

564
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,220
Nations peace keeper,

565
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,970
they give you a blue helmet and
anybody can fill that role and he,

566
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:15,690
any nation that's part of the UN Americans
fill that role from time to time,

567
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:16,980
but any nation can do it.

568
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,080
So he's saying that the blue helmets did
nothing except an about face to leave

569
00:41:22,081 --> 00:41:22,914
us alone.

570
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:28,350
Why would they come back before
it's all over at that signal.

571
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,120
Off We went.

572
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,130
We were certain of killing

573
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,410
everyone without drawing evil looks,

574
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,590
without getting a scolding
from a white or a priest.

575
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,090
We joked about it instead
of pressing our advantage.

576
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:49,510
We felt too at ease with an unfamiliar
job that had gotten off to a good start,

577
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,740
but time in laziness played an
ugly trick on us. Basically.

578
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,110
We became too sure of ourselves.

579
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,860
We slowed down and that
overconfidence is what did a sin.

580
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,740
So let's hear a little bit about the,

581
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:13,140
the psychological impact of
what's happening to the book.

582
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,340
Rowdy's kept on slaughtering cows after
the killings because they couldn't put

583
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:22,300
down their machetes
during the killings.

584
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,340
We had not one wedding, not one
baptism, not once. Soccer match.

585
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,190
Not One religious service like Easter.

586
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:35,560
We did not find that kind of celebration.
Interesting anymore. We did not care.

587
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:39,910
Spit for Sunday silliness.
We were dead tired from work.

588
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,270
We were getting greedy.
We celebrated whenever we felt like it.

589
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,960
We drank as much as we wanted.
Some turned into drunks.

590
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,870
Anyone who felt sad about someone he had
killed really had to hide his words and

591
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:57,730
his regrets for fear of being seen as
an accomplice and being treated roughly.

592
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:04,740
Sometimes drinkers went mean when they
had found no one to kill that day.

593
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:09,210
Oh, there's went mean because
they had killed too much.

594
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:13,680
You had to show them a
smiling face or watch out.

595
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:18,183
Yeah,

596
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,630
different personalities.

597
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,950
Some guys are going crazy because they're
not killing enough and some guys are

598
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:27,440
going crazy because
they're killing too much.

599
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,550
A youth could hide a girl he had brought
back from the marshes to have her

600
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:40,510
behind a pen or a clump of bushes,

601
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,190
but when he had had enough or when
tongue started wagging. In other words,

602
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:48,250
when people started talking about the
fact that he had brought one of these

603
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,550
girls back, he had to kill her
to avoid a serious penalty.

604
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,130
We had sessions with girls
who were raped in the bush.

605
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,170
Nobody dared protests that.

606
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:05,000
Even those who are edgy about it because
they had received blessings in church,

607
00:44:05,001 --> 00:44:05,900
for example,

608
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,520
told themselves it would change nothing
since the girl was marked for death

609
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:11,420
anyways,

610
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,220
there were two kinds of rapists.

611
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,890
Some took the girls and use them until
the end. Even on the flight to the Congo,

612
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,480
they took advantage of the situation to
sleep with the prettiest Tutsis and an

613
00:44:26,481 --> 00:44:29,330
exchange showed them a
little bit of consideration.

614
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,620
Others caught just to fool around
with for having sex and drinking.

615
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,950
They raped for a little while and then
handed them over to be killed right

616
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:41,940
afterward.
There were no orders from the authorities.

617
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,050
The two kinds,
we're free to do as they pleased.

618
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:50,870
Now we get into a

619
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:54,940
a story,

620
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,300
I don't know what to call it
other than a story, a travesty,

621
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,403
a horror

622
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,350
coming from one of the workers at a,

623
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,320
okay.

624
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,240
Add a little,
basically a little Christian hospital.

625
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,510
They surrounded the maternity hospital.

626
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,520
They ripped down the gates.
They simply shot up the locks.

627
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,190
They wore very handsome cartridge
belts of highly polished leather,

628
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,670
but they wanted to avoid wasting bullets.

629
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,400
They killed the women
with machetes and clubs.

630
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,420
Whenever one of the more agile girls
managed to escape in the commotion and get

631
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:53,720
out a window,
she was caught in the gardens.

632
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,610
When a mama had hidden her
child been underneath her,

633
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,850
they picked her up first,

634
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,260
then cut the child than
cut its mother last.

635
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,940
They didn't bother to cut
the nursing infants properly.

636
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:18,580
They slammed them against the walls to
save time or hurled them alive onto the

637
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:20,570
heaps of corpses.

638
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:27,500
That morning we were more
than 300 women and children.

639
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:33,940
That evening in the garden there only
five women left speared because they were

640
00:46:34,071 --> 00:46:35,720
lucky to have been born.
Who too.

641
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,730
Now the author

642
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:54,710
goes into a statement here about,

643
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,600
yeah,

644
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,470
about a tradition in war torn areas
where you know there's some sort of

645
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:02,790
friendship or there's some,

646
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,180
some love that that makes people do
things that are outside the bounds of what

647
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,900
the norm of what the massacres are
helping the opposite side or whatever.

648
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:16,650
So, so he says this, people have,

649
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:20,850
who have lived through war often tell
wonderful stories about friendships,

650
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:24,180
incredible romances,
amazing gestures of solidarity,

651
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:29,510
comical and poignant collaborations
between protagonists and enemy camps or

652
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,380
humble and admirable deeds.

653
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,510
It all provides material
for novels, songs, films,

654
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:41,780
and evening of evenings of memories,
near Patches,

655
00:47:41,781 --> 00:47:44,750
things up between you and humanity.

656
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,680
French and German.

657
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:52,681
Conscripts conscripts chatted across
the trencher trenches and swap tins of

658
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:54,124
potted meat.

659
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:59,140
Algerians hid French colonists
with whom they played cards.

660
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:03,700
A vici minister foiled the deportation
of a colleague with whom he had went to

661
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:07,960
school. It was the same
in Vietnam, Ireland,

662
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:12,220
Lebanon and Gola, El
Salvador, Israel, Chechnya,

663
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,800
in the name of passion, childhood, a clan,

664
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,760
elemental things like
affection or loyalty.

665
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,083
But here

666
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:32,710
we find not one comradery,

667
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,920
impulse among teammates,

668
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,210
not one gesture of compassion for
helpless babies at the breast.

669
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,170
No bond of friendship or love that
survived from a church choir or an

670
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:47,940
agricultural cooperative.

671
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,330
No civil disobedience in a village,

672
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,080
no rebellious adolescent
in a gang of budding Tufts

673
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,780
and not a single escape network,

674
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,190
although it would have been easy to
have set one up in the 40 kilometers of

675
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:06,760
uninhabited forest between the
marshes and the Burundi border.

676
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:11,980
No convoy,
no links among the herders paths,

677
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,320
no web of hiding places to allow
the evacuation of survivors

678
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,333
nothing

679
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,040
and it continues.

680
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:30,050
He continues to talk about really the
difference between genocide and war

681
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,010
in war, men are killed first because
they are the most apt to fight back.

682
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:43,490
The next targets are women liable to
help them and boys because they try to

683
00:49:43,491 --> 00:49:48,320
continue the conflict and then older
men who can offer wise counsel.

684
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:55,990
But in genocide the killers track
down everyone in particular babies,

685
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,580
girls and women because
they represent the future.

686
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,810
Genocide goes beyond war because
the intention lasts forever.

687
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,050
It is a final intention

688
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,520
and again just talking about the
fact that there was no mercy,

689
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,510
no mercy. One of the killer says,
I do not know of a single who,

690
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:31,511
two woman who hid away a little tootsie
child to save it from the massacre of

691
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:32,414
its family,

692
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,790
not even a toddler wrapped in a cloth or
nursing unrecognizable to her neighbors

693
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:39,410
because of it's tender age.

694
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,120
Not One woman on the whole hill
cheated in the way of a rescue,

695
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,670
not even for a short moment of trying.

696
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,280
And what are the other killers said?

697
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:58,530
I did not hear many women protesting
against two seat Tutsis being raped.

698
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:03,570
The knew this work of killing fiercely
heated up the men in the marshes.

699
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,810
The agreed on this except of course if
the men did their dirty sex work near the

700
00:51:08,971 --> 00:51:13,860
houses,
and again,

701
00:51:13,861 --> 00:51:18,861
here's one of the killers talking about
the fact that they knew these people

702
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,820
in war you kill someone who
fights you or promises you harm

703
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,550
and killings of this kind.

704
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:35,190
You kill the Tutsi woman used to listen
to the radio with or the kind lady who

705
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:40,191
vote medicine plants on your wounds or
your sister who is married to a Tutsi or

706
00:51:42,151 --> 00:51:44,340
even for some unlucky devils,

707
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,930
your own Tutsi wife and your
children by General demand.

708
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,550
You slaughter the woman.
Same as man.

709
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:03,320
That is the difference
which changes everything

710
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:11,610
and here's the loan story of
someone that tried to stop this.

711
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,820
It was close to noon on April 11th sold.

712
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,330
Remember this started on April
six so it's been five days.

713
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,900
The first day of the Tutsi
on in this particular area

714
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,510
is a door,

715
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:35,320
was sitting on a chair in front of his
house resting after a morning of weeding.

716
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,660
He was a Hutu farmer,

717
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,380
65 years old who had
arrived 20 years before.

718
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,600
Okay.

719
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:49,600
Some strapping fellows armed with
machetes came singing up the path that ran

720
00:52:49,731 --> 00:52:54,731
near his house is a door called to
them and as deep old voice and lectured

721
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:57,710
demond public in front of the neighbors.

722
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,920
You young men are evil doers.

723
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,940
Turn on your heels and go your blades.

724
00:53:04,941 --> 00:53:08,060
Point the way towards a
dreadful misfortune for us all.

725
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,680
Do not stir up disputes too
dangerous for us farmers.

726
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,460
Stop tormenting our neighbors
and go back to your fields.

727
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,000
Two killers approached him laughing

728
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:26,100
and without a word cut
him down with machetes.

729
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:31,000
Among the band was is it doors son

730
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:34,620
who according to witnesses,

731
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,190
neither protested nor stop
to bend over the body.

732
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:45,840
These young men went on their way singing.

733
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:53,770
Now speaking of family and I mentioned
that some of the Hutus and Tutsis work

734
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:59,290
intermarried and had mixed children and
here's sort of the standard operating

735
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:05,210
procedure for that.
This is coming from one of the killers,

736
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:09,350
a Tutsi wife.
You could try to save her.

737
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:15,650
You offered a cow to the leader and the
radio with the like to the organizers.

738
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:19,100
Then you handed out small payments of
money to those who were prowling around

739
00:54:19,101 --> 00:54:23,570
your house, but that wasn't even worth
trying if you did not want to cooperate.

740
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,670
Meaning if you didn't want to kill a
Tutsi husband, you couldn't bargain for

741
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,550
he was at the head of the list.
If his wife began to argue,

742
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:40,440
she was struck right away and they
cut her husband while she watched to

743
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:41,274
discourage her.

744
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:42,560
Okay.

745
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,580
If she kept on,
she'd be caught herself with her children.

746
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,880
One or the other killers said someone
who wanted to save this Tutsi wife was

747
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:59,330
required to show great
enthusiasm in the killings.

748
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:05,140
Someone who behaved weekly or
timidly new is all over for his wife.

749
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,080
Grousing or idleness doomed her.

750
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:13,923
Okay,

751
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,170
dove,
you even complained

752
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:21,600
and they talk about,

753
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,180
I wonder the other killers talking about
how it was easy to kill her, the street,

754
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,033
the strangers.

755
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,870
It was much better to kill strangers and
acquaintances because acquaintances had

756
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:37,100
time to stab you with an intense
look before receiving the blows.

757
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,140
I look from a stranger pierce to
your mind or memory less easily,

758
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,203
but

759
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:54,370
there were some that obviously seem to

760
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,790
enjoy this.

761
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,030
Some amused themselves with their machetes
on the Tutsis to show off their skill

762
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:08,110
to everyone. They would swagger
around boasting later in the evening.

763
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,890
Some slowed down their
machetes just for punishment.

764
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:17,710
If a Tutsi you'd worn out a
pursuer in a running chase,

765
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:22,120
he could be teased with the point of
a machete. It would be nasty for him.

766
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,970
It was like demonstrating the bad example

767
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,370
except that no one was
left alive to notice.

768
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,213
Yeah,

769
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,790
and obviously when you have families,
you have children and we have children,

770
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:45,990
you have babies

771
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,170
and here's one of the killers talking
about the treatment of the babies,

772
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,390
saving the babies.
That was not practical.

773
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,030
They were whacked against walls and
trees or they were caught right away,

774
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:08,920
but they were killed more quickly
because of their small size and because

775
00:57:08,921 --> 00:57:10,990
they're suffering was of no use.

776
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:17,200
They say that at the church they
burned the children with gasoline.

777
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,860
Maybe it's true,
but that was just in the first day turmoil

778
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:26,770
after that afterward.
That did not last.

779
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,170
In any case,
I noticed nothing more.

780
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:33,940
The babies could not understand
the why of the suffering.

781
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:36,490
It was not worth lingering over them.

782
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:40,853
Yeah,

783
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,500
and as I mentioned earlier,
some of the kids

784
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:46,960
were part of the killing.

785
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,270
And here's one of the killers talking
about that many children killed

786
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:58,200
some save, the were sickened
by it, scared of it,

787
00:57:58,201 --> 00:58:03,201
but we're forced to cut by their mamas
are papa's most are completely silent

788
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:06,810
when they hear talk of the
killings even from years ago,

789
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:12,900
keeping silent blocks,
both judgment and change.

790
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:26,023
Now,

791
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,510
to add to the evil of all this,

792
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:37,550
to add to the, to the end,
comprehensible nature of it all, it's,

793
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:38,443
it's,

794
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:46,850
it's almost just unbelievable
nature.

795
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:50,810
But on top of all this,
these people were Christians.

796
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:56,510
They were Catholics. They were,
they were church going people

797
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:03,910
that were transformed almost
instantly into murderers.

798
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,953
Okay.

799
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,220
And here's one of those,

800
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:13,260
one of the killers talking about that
transformation that Saturday after the

801
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:17,970
plane crash was the usual choir
rehearsal day at the church.

802
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,000
We sang hymns in good
feeling with our Tutsi.

803
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:24,830
Are Voices still blending in the chorus

804
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:30,680
on Sunday morning we were, we returned
at the appointed hour for mass.

805
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,720
They did not arrive.

806
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:38,120
They had already fled into the bush in
fear of reprisals driving their goats and

807
00:59:38,121 --> 00:59:42,290
cows before them.
That disappointed us greatly,

808
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,060
especially on a Sunday.

809
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,500
Anger hustled us outside the church door.

810
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,793
Okay.

811
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:55,930
We left the Lord and our
prayers inside to rush home.

812
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,080
Okay.

813
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:02,280
We changed from our Sunday best
into our work a day clothes.

814
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,770
We grabbed clubs and machetes.
We went straight off to kill him.

815
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,620
Here's another killer.
I was a deacon,

816
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:26,330
the one who made arrangements for the
Christian gatherings on the hill in the

817
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:31,650
priest absence.
It was I who conducted ordinary services

818
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,590
during the killings.
I chose not to pray to God.

819
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:41,510
I sense that it was not
appropriate to involve him in that

820
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,920
the white priest took off.
At the first skirmishes.

821
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:54,090
The black priests joined
the killers or the killed

822
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,680
God kept silent and the church
is stank from abandoned bodies.

823
01:01:02,270 --> 01:01:07,070
Religion could not find its place
in our activity for a little while,

824
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,050
we were no longer ordinary Christians.

825
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:13,460
We had to forget our duties
learned in catechism class. We had,

826
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,211
first of all,

827
01:01:14,211 --> 01:01:19,160
to obey our leaders and God only
afterward very long afterward to make

828
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:23,690
confession and penance
when the job was done

829
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,880
again. Aye. Aye.

830
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,643
Yeah.

831
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:34,040
It's just, it's, it's, I didn't know if,

832
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:39,120
if I could give this book to
bring people here to this place.

833
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,633
Okay.

834
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,500
And to me,
this part that I'm about to go through is,

835
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,250
yeah,

836
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,660
about as dark as it gets in the marshes.

837
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:59,580
You heard no children's cries,
not even murmurs.

838
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,670
They waited silently in the mud.

839
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:08,130
It was really something when we
uncovered a woman with a nursing,

840
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:10,350
the infant would not even whimper.

841
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:11,930
Okay.

842
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,820
It was miraculous,
so to speak.

843
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:20,250
Many Tutsis,
no longer to be spared.

844
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,770
That was how they greeted
death among themselves.

845
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:29,120
They had stopped hoping.

846
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:36,190
They knew they had no chance for mercy
and went off without a single prayer.

847
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:39,403
Okay.

848
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:43,590
They knew they were abandoned
by everything, even by God.

849
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,150
Okay.

850
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,730
They no longer spoke to him at all.

851
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:49,920
Okay.

852
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:54,360
They were leaving in suffering to join
him and no longer asked him for anything.

853
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,180
Not Comfort, not blessing, not welcome.

854
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,470
They no longer prayed even to drive
away the fear of an agonizing death.

855
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:13,140
It was two astounding.
It was unnatural.

856
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:17,820
Even animals that know nothing of pity,
nothing of anguish, nothing of evil.

857
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,270
They cry out terribly at the
moment of the fatal blow.

858
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:30,370
That mystery drove us to many discussions.

859
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:35,560
We saw explanations for these Tutsis
who went often to death without breaking

860
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,730
their silence.

861
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:44,650
That could frighten us sometimes at night
because it was said that such calmness

862
01:03:44,651 --> 01:03:46,420
must be a bad omen from heaven

863
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:53,510
and here's the one to the other killers
talking about that silent death from the

864
01:03:53,511 --> 01:03:54,350
Tutsis

865
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,940
when the Tutsis were caught,
many died without a word.

866
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:06,190
In Rwanda,
people say die like a lamb and the Bible.

867
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:07,910
Okay.

868
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:12,110
Of course, in Rwanda there are no
sheep, so we have never heard their cry.

869
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:18,450
It's sometimes touched us painfully
that they awaited death. In silence

870
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,360
evenings we would ask over and over,

871
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,540
why no protest from these
people who are about to leave?

872
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,840
Why do the beg for mercy?

873
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:34,130
The organizers claim that the Tutsis
felt guilty for the sin of being Tutsi.

874
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:35,070
Okay.

875
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:38,760
Some kept saying they felt responsible
for the misfortunes they had brought upon

876
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:42,740
us.
Well,

877
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:44,420
I knew that was not true.

878
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:50,730
The Tutsis were not asking for anything
in those fatal moments because they no

879
01:04:50,731 --> 01:04:52,680
longer believed in words.

880
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,810
They had no more faith in crying out

881
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:03,420
like frightened animals, for
example, howling to be heard above.

882
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,920
The mortal blows

883
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:10,720
and overpowering sorrow was
carrying those people away

884
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,380
and they felt so abandoned.

885
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:15,590
Yeah,

886
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:16,970
they did not even open their,

887
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:22,280
and while all that was happening,

888
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,480
where were we?

889
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:31,411
Like I said,
I mean,

890
01:05:31,411 --> 01:05:36,390
I was in a seal platoon on that ship.
We were had

891
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,950
assets in the Marine
Corps did, like I said,

892
01:05:42,951 --> 01:05:47,840
something small. They got authorization,
but it was tiny in comparison

893
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:56,530
and it was
to hear them,

894
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,050
to hear the killers talk about that.

895
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:04,380
Here's,
here's what one of them said.

896
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,360
All the important people turned
their backs on our killings,

897
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,990
the blue helmets, the
Belgians, the white directors,

898
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,430
the black presidents,

899
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:20,870
the humanitarian people and
the international cameraman,

900
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:24,680
the priests and the bishops.
And finally, even God,

901
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:29,560
did he watch what was
happening in the marshes?

902
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:36,520
Why did he not stab out our murderous
eyes with his wrath or show some small

903
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:42,040
sign of disapproval to
save more lucky ones?

904
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,220
A knows horrible moments
who could hear his silence?

905
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:55,020
We were abandoned by all words of rebuke.

906
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:56,860
Okay?

907
01:06:56,860 --> 01:07:01,850
And I'm gonna close from
the book with this statement

908
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:06,210
from one of the survivors

909
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:14,270
before I knew a man could kill another
man because it happens all the time.

910
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,520
Now I know that even the person with
whom you've shared food with whom you've

911
01:07:23,101 --> 01:07:27,120
slept,
even he can kill you with no trouble.

912
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,490
The closest neighbor can turn
out to be the most horrible.

913
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:37,670
An evil person can kill
you with his teeth.

914
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,620
That is what I've learned
since the genocide.

915
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:43,030
Okay?

916
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:47,830
And my eyes no longer gaze.
The same on the face of the world.

917
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:54,740
My eyes no longer gaze.
The same on the face of the world.

918
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:02,893
What?

919
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,090
What can we take away from this?
This

920
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,810
blogger madness?

921
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:18,110
Yeah,
we have to learn something.

922
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:20,540
We have to gain something.
But what?

923
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,203
What is it?

924
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:30,690
And as I tried to answer
that question for myself,

925
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:38,640
I thought about something that
I say and something that I know

926
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,460
and this made it even more clear

927
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,260
that there is evil in the world.

928
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:52,980
There is darkness and
it exists and it's real,

929
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:54,663
okay.

930
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:02,700
And it comes from us.
It's human. It is people.

931
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:07,380
We
are evil,

932
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:10,413
okay?

933
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:14,650
It wasn't a, it wasn't a monster
that murdered all those people,

934
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:18,670
those men and those women and
those children and those babies.

935
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:25,540
It wasn't an animal or some force of
nature like a tornado or a hurricane or a

936
01:09:26,121 --> 01:09:26,954
tsunami,

937
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:30,263
okay.

938
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:35,520
And it wasn't Satan and it wasn't
some mysterious evil spirit.

939
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,093
Yeah,

940
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:42,130
it was us.

941
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:50,580
And that that is downright horrifying.

942
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:02,740
But there is a counter that,
there is a dichotomy to that,

943
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,373
okay?

944
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,090
And that is the fact that wall,

945
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:12,290
we are the evil in this world.

946
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:19,300
We are also the good,

947
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:24,340
we are the light that
counters this darkness.

948
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:32,090
And it sickens my heart to know that
we did nothing while this happened.

949
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:36,860
And I was there, I was off the coast,
I was on deployment in my platoon,

950
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:40,670
was one quick helicopter flight away.
And maybe we could have helped.

951
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,640
Maybe we could have saved
even just one person,

952
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:46,940
one child or one mom or one baby.

953
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,130
We could have made some
kind of difference.

954
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:55,373
But we didn't,

955
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,960
we didn't get the order.

956
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:05,110
And so we sat while this evil unfolded

957
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,780
and I'm ashamed of.

958
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,183
Yeah,

959
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:19,983
because you see,

960
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:25,740
we all have the capacity to
bring light into the world,

961
01:11:26,951 --> 01:11:31,450
to counter the darkness. All of us do
in some way, maybe, maybe not directly,

962
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:36,550
maybe not face to face with evil,
but we can help.

963
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:42,160
All of us can help.

964
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:51,030
So the message I take away
from this abject horror,

965
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:53,833
to me,

966
01:11:56,780 --> 01:11:58,850
it's that I need to focus,

967
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:03,851
that we need to focus on what
good we can do to help people

968
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,190
who can, who can we help? How can we
help get better? Who can we improve,

969
01:12:12,191 --> 01:12:14,320
help improve their station in life?

970
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:21,850
What threatened person can we defend?
What oppressed person can we free?

971
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:27,690
What person,
what,

972
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:32,310
what fellow human being can we
remove from the grip of fear?

973
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,910
Who can we,
who can I,

974
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:45,780
who can we? What person out in the
world can we take from the darkness?

975
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:46,800
And bring into the light.

976
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:52,013
And that's

977
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:57,630
the question and the answer
that I brought away from this.

978
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,950
And I know that this was a heavy,
heavy book cover

979
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:07,010
and I,
like I said,

980
01:13:07,011 --> 01:13:12,011
I don't just want every time that you
turn on this podcast to get crushed with

981
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:14,120
something like this,

982
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:18,420
I don't want to dwell on it.

983
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:22,820
And then I've got some good positive
books I want to look at next,

984
01:13:23,020 --> 01:13:25,100
but I don't want to ignore
this kind of thing either.

985
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:32,920
Because as I've said before,
you can't appreciate the light

986
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:37,900
if you don't understand the darkness.

987
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:47,640
And as I said, this is truly
about as dark as it gets. A

988
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:55,470
little bit heavy Heiko
yeah, yeah, I'd say so.

989
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:56,663
Yeah.

990
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:03,590
I gave echo a heads up three
or four days ago and I said,

991
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:08,370
hey man,
I'm not quite sure about this one.

992
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:12,580
This is going to leave a mark.
And

993
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:18,070
I truly debated whether
or not to go forward,

994
01:14:19,650 --> 01:14:22,030
you know, because there were some
people that even, or even about the,

995
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,960
even about the forgotten Highlander,
there were some people that said, hey,

996
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:30,880
you know, that's just too much. You know,
that's just too much and this is, this is,

997
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:36,330
this is completely beyond
that because the, the,

998
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,890
there is no rhyme or reason.

999
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:42,840
I mean at least you could look at a
Japanese imperial soldier and say, Hey,

1000
01:14:42,841 --> 01:14:47,370
he's a sick person that's doing
something for this. Cause there was,

1001
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:48,480
there was nothing here.

1002
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:53,850
No rhyme or reason that was
just slaughter kids and beat.

1003
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,033
That's,

1004
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,630
that takes it to a whole nother level and
just how they talk in detail about how

1005
01:15:00,631 --> 01:15:02,780
they deal with the kids.
Yeah.

1006
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:08,030
Then again, to me, the,

1007
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:16,630
the thing I took away from it as this
sort of personal responsibility that we

1008
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:17,464
all have

1009
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:23,320
to help out other humans.
And again,

1010
01:15:23,321 --> 01:15:26,050
I understand that everyone's
not going to be in the military,

1011
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:29,680
out on the front lines, fighting
against, you know, tyranny and evil.

1012
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:32,230
I understand that.
But what can you do to help out?

1013
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,570
And I've said this since day one,
I was wondering,

1014
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:36,280
one of the things I talked about
in this podcast is, you know,

1015
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,090
I don't feel like I'm really
good at helping, you know,

1016
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:42,940
people with causes and stuff like that.
I just don't feel it.

1017
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,370
I don't feel like it's
something I'm very good at.

1018
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:51,100
But this makes you rethink and say what,
what? You know, what can you do to help?

1019
01:15:51,101 --> 01:15:55,060
Because there's people that are suffering.
I mean obviously right now we've got,

1020
01:15:55,810 --> 01:16:00,340
you know, we got isis better doing
the same activities if not worse.

1021
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:04,810
They just do just crucified a
priest that was just in the news.

1022
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:08,710
So the evil is still there

1023
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,020
and it is happening before our own eyes.

1024
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:16,460
Okay.

1025
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:20,080
It makes me,
it makes me sick

1026
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,720
that we,

1027
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:29,140
with the ability to do something about it,
we sit on the sidelines.

1028
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,900
So hopefully we start to
move in a direction where

1029
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,480
we take a leadership role in the world
and help lead the world towards the light

1030
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,520
fade away from the darkness.

1031
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,833
Yeah.

1032
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:55,423
And

1033
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:03,230
with that thought,
let's move away from the,

1034
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:06,490
this darkness right now let's
talk about something else.

1035
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:09,860
Not to forget about this,
but

1036
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:15,340
we do have to recognize that we got to
live our lives and people got to live

1037
01:17:16,071 --> 01:17:20,060
their lives. And again, don't
deny that this stuff is out there.

1038
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:25,700
Don't forget that this stuff is out
there. Relish your situation. If you're,

1039
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:28,280
if you have a MP,

1040
01:17:28,281 --> 01:17:32,480
three player of some kind and you're
listening to this podcast, be thankful.

1041
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:35,390
Be Thankful that you're in that situation

1042
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,170
and look down below you into the darkness.
And if you get the chance,

1043
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:45,040
put out your hand and see if
there's someone down there,

1044
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:46,100
okay.

1045
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,210
That you can help pull up.

1046
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,440
So, uh, out of that heaviness
and out of that darkness,

1047
01:17:55,441 --> 01:17:58,510
let's head into a little
bit of light now with, uh,

1048
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,800
the community questions and questions
from the troopers out there.

1049
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:07,910
I've got questions for us and

1050
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:09,130
okay.

1051
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:10,610
You know, before we talk about the, uh,

1052
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:14,410
before we go to questions
from the inner webs,

1053
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:19,000
what can we do from the interwebs
supporting the OP podcast style?

1054
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,770
Yeah,
well it depends on your mission,

1055
01:18:20,771 --> 01:18:25,771
but in the event of you wanting to
support this podcast in any capacity,

1056
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,640
um, well it's a bunch of things you
can do. You can uh, do your Amazon,

1057
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:34,480
Amazon shopping.
Like if you want to get that book,

1058
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:38,020
you want to buy this book right here,
which you should cause shitty season.

1059
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:40,840
Cause it's an eye opener. I
don't know though. I don't know.

1060
01:18:40,841 --> 01:18:44,800
It might not be for everybody. I'm
telling you. If you're a human,

1061
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:49,270
you should know about what the world is
like. I did get machete season. Yeah,

1062
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:52,780
right there. If you want to get
that, for example, through Amazon,

1063
01:18:52,781 --> 01:18:57,781
just click through the link that is
on Jocko podcast.com or Jocko podcast.

1064
01:18:58,910 --> 01:19:01,990
[inaudible] dot com or Jocko store.
And by the way,

1065
01:19:01,991 --> 01:19:04,570
if you want to buy anything from
Amazon and you click through that link,

1066
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,740
little some goes to the
podcast, right? Yeah.

1067
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:11,620
So you're kind of passively
supporting. Um, also, you know what,

1068
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:16,650
you know what I didn't realize
earlier today we have shirts.

1069
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:18,860
Yeah.

1070
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:21,980
Jocko podcast shirts there.
You know there are a couple of designs.

1071
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:26,640
I've never mentioned it.
I posted a picture on Twitter before,

1072
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:29,250
like a couple of pictures on Twitter.
That's it. I'm never mentioned it.

1073
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:33,110
So that's another way to support
the podcast. Yeah, get yourself,

1074
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,920
get yourself a shirt.
But there's a,

1075
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,260
if you just look at the shirts there
at Jocko, store.com, look at them.

1076
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:43,010
If you like it, if you like one of them
or, or both the designs or whatever,

1077
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:47,540
get a shirt, you don't like
them, don't get the shyness.
That's simple enough. Yup.

1078
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,840
There it is.
And then of course on it,

1079
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,600
he's a
supporter of this podcast,

1080
01:19:57,020 --> 01:20:02,020
o n n I t.com/jocko and get 10% off
anything on it is where we alpha brain

1081
01:20:09,090 --> 01:20:13,520
to fuel this podcast. And we're
Jacobi's amongst the buildings. Yeah.

1082
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:17,430
A bunch of other stuff.
Cool stuff and quality legitimate stuff.

1083
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:21,420
I think that's a big deal because a
lot of times like you can take protein

1084
01:20:21,421 --> 01:20:23,580
supplements or something
like that and it won't work,

1085
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:26,220
but you won't really even know. You
want to get to clean stuff. Yeah.

1086
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:30,090
You want to get the good stuff. And
this, and I've mentioned this before,

1087
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:33,390
you can get caught up on that website
reading all the interesting stuff,

1088
01:20:33,391 --> 01:20:36,620
like how they get this and how they get
these ingredients, all that stuff. Um,

1089
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:40,090
which actually isn't a bad thing
because you know now, but, um,

1090
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:43,230
nonetheless it's all
right there. You can, uh,

1091
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:46,200
you can read about all the supplements
that you're thinking about getting.

1092
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:50,100
I recommend shroom tech sport as always.

1093
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:55,530
If you're going to do hard stuff that's
like extended in a hard like Jujitsu or

1094
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,200
you know,
across it situation or that kind of stuff.

1095
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,510
She always called a crossfit
situation yet as if it's on,

1096
01:21:01,511 --> 01:21:04,530
that's going to occur like crying.
I appreciate that.

1099
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:22,680
It's got some questions going.
Okay. First Question Jocko,

1100
01:21:22,681 --> 01:21:27,570
can you tell us your views on Brazilian
Jujitsu competing mindset and training

1101
01:21:27,571 --> 01:21:29,430
leading into a competition?

1102
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:34,000
Well, competing is great.
Competing makes you better.

1103
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:35,560
Competing points out your weaknesses.

1104
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:38,220
Competing lets you roll against people
that you've never trained with before

1105
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:43,260
that are going to go 1000% against
you and remove matters in competition.

1106
01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:47,210
Yes, they bring it. Uh,

1107
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:51,280
I competed a ton back in the early days.
Um,

1108
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,900
you know, you know, really, I'll just
talk about dean because Dean and I were,

1109
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:58,120
were teammates back then and still are,

1110
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:03,121
but we competed all the time and we
competed in the old school tournaments.

1111
01:22:03,671 --> 01:22:08,440
The uh, the grappling games,
they used to have those, the,

1112
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:11,200
the,
the Pan American submission grappling.

1113
01:22:11,201 --> 01:22:15,730
It was sorta like some offshoot or
another competing sort of Pan Am's type

1114
01:22:15,731 --> 01:22:19,450
situation. Uh, my, my, there was the,

1115
01:22:19,570 --> 01:22:23,140
the Jo Marie era tournaments back
in the day. Those were pretty cool.

1116
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:26,560
And uh,
the Copa Pacifica,

1117
01:22:26,561 --> 01:22:28,780
I think I did a few of
those back in the day,

1118
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:32,650
but by my favorite was doing the neutral
grounds tournament's cause those were

1119
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:37,510
like held up in La up in the
hood somewhere and we'd roll in,

1120
01:22:37,511 --> 01:22:40,900
it'd be kind of underground and those
were really cool competition. So,

1121
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:44,170
but competed a ton back
in the day. Um, once,

1122
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:46,630
honestly once September 11th happened,

1123
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:49,270
that was now my focus
more than anything else.

1124
01:22:49,510 --> 01:22:51,160
And I needed to be ready
and need to be ready.

1125
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:55,330
I couldn't be having a blown out knee. I
couldn't be having a hurt shoulder. So,

1126
01:22:55,860 --> 01:23:00,760
and furthermore, I had like less
time to focus and have real, like,

1127
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,480
let's call it a training camp to be ready
to compete at a high level. And I mean,

1128
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:06,070
I was at a high, you know, I mean, I was,

1129
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:10,360
I was, you know, a brown belt
or black belt at the time.

1130
01:23:10,840 --> 01:23:14,620
And so it wasn't like you could just show
up the weekend warrior and jump in the

1131
01:23:14,621 --> 01:23:16,750
jump on the mat with a, you know, some,

1132
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:19,510
some other black belt and it
was going to go easy for you.

1133
01:23:19,511 --> 01:23:21,550
It wasn't gonna Happen.
So I didn't, you know,

1134
01:23:21,551 --> 01:23:25,000
the bottom line is I needed to be 100%
for the job. Uh, but competing is awesome.

1135
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,500
It's intense.
No matter what you do in training,

1136
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:33,610
you cannot get a person as fired up as
they are going to be in competition.

1137
01:23:33,611 --> 01:23:36,490
It's not gonna happen.
So it's really good to,

1138
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,270
to compete.
So you find out what your weaknesses,

1139
01:23:40,271 --> 01:23:43,090
you find out what it feels like when
someone's going psycho on you because

1140
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:46,870
they're going to be going psycho.
And to prepare for them, you know,

1141
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:49,780
you gotta you got to, my favorite
thing to do prepares, you know,

1142
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:53,180
you get guys where they're going.
Got Fresh people coming on. Yeah.

1143
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,440
Because everybody can be destroyed when
fatigue rolls in and starts getting,

1144
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:02,500
playing a role in the situation.
It's been, it's good, it's bad.

1145
01:24:02,501 --> 01:24:07,000
So when you bring in a fresh person,
you know, after every two minutes,

1146
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:11,610
three minutes, four minutes, one minute,
six minutes. But one person is, is,

1147
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,950
is fighting the whole time and other
people are getting arrested and coming in.

1148
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,470
That's very challenging.
It makes you rely on your technique.

1149
01:24:17,471 --> 01:24:20,590
It pushes you beyond your normal limits
and it's an awesome way to do it.

1150
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:22,720
So that being said,

1151
01:24:22,721 --> 01:24:25,360
you also can't just do that all the
time because you have to train your

1152
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:28,300
explosiveness as well and you
need to be ready to do, you know,

1153
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:29,680
if you're doing a seven minute fight,

1154
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:31,300
you need to be able to go
hard for seven minutes.

1155
01:24:31,301 --> 01:24:34,240
And not save everything
for a 38 minute fight,

1156
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,160
which is what you sometimes
end up doing in the gym.

1157
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:40,870
I do that all the time in
the gym. I'm doing yo six
rounds, seven rounds, you know,

1158
01:24:40,871 --> 01:24:45,070
nine rounds, whatever the case may be.
And you're also doing just one round,

1159
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:49,000
but it's one round that's 23 minutes
long. Yeah, that happens too.

1160
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:53,590
So I like to do a little bit of
all those things and but yeah,

1161
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:57,160
compete,
get yourself better and it'll,

1162
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,140
it'll definitely make you
a better Jujitsu player,

1163
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:02,860
which will make you a better person.
And you see that pressure,

1164
01:25:03,010 --> 01:25:06,550
you don't want another tactic which is,
which is kind of good.

1165
01:25:06,730 --> 01:25:10,940
And Jeff will do this sometimes he'll
do like a three minute round. Yeah.

1166
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:14,950
So it's strange because when you know
there's only three minutes that you kind

1167
01:25:14,951 --> 01:25:18,130
of get that illusion that I'm just going
to go all out and we'll see how many,

1168
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:20,470
if I can get this guy,
I only have three minutes to get them.

1169
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:24,270
And so you're to heart until your sense
of urgency is more than if you have an

1170
01:25:24,271 --> 01:25:27,780
eight minute route for your prep.
But here's the, here's the little,

1171
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,400
and I dunno if Jeff did
this on purpose but purpose,

1172
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:34,210
it's kind of this little trick where
you're going hard but he only gives us 30

1173
01:25:34,211 --> 01:25:35,570
seconds in between.
So it's,

1174
01:25:35,571 --> 01:25:38,500
it doesn't matter if it's the three main
area and you're going like six rounds.

1175
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:39,610
Yeah.
So you're like,

1176
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,360
and so that will test your conditioning
but it'll test like your quickness and

1177
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:47,380
not quickness like quick,
but your urgency, you know,

1178
01:25:47,381 --> 01:25:50,470
you're not going to be just chilling
in some guys guard or you know,

1179
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:54,190
cause cause it's, you can fossil to
chill in the guard. You can, yeah.

1180
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:57,670
In fact that's actually a good
strategy in some cases. You know,

1181
01:25:57,671 --> 01:26:00,370
when you got every cover or
something like this. Anyway,

1182
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:03,980
that's interesting one
that I to realize when

1183
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,910
Jeff put it on us one
day. Love. Yes. Okay,

1184
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,150
next question. Yeah, let's do it. Okay.

1185
01:26:11,151 --> 01:26:16,151
I hurt myself significantly throwing a
roundhouse kick recently abdominal hernia

1186
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,870
at the site of an old appendix surgery.

1187
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:23,360
I trained MMA five days a week,

1188
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:27,350
sometimes more and multiple times a day
for two years until last week when he

1189
01:26:27,351 --> 01:26:28,184
got that injury.

1190
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:33,830
But now I can hardly sit in a chair
without pain in surgery is two months out.

1191
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:38,480
And who knows how long recovery recovery
will be. Um, before I can train again,

1192
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:44,530
what I'm asking is what should we as
martial artists in men do in times of

1193
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:49,670
forced hiatus an injury?
What do we do when there's a quiet,

1194
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:53,900
but we miss the storm?
Well,

1195
01:26:56,020 --> 01:26:59,770
one thing with injuries,
injuries are going to come and you cut.

1196
01:26:59,771 --> 01:27:03,370
Would you get saw dust, you train,
you're going to get injured.

1197
01:27:03,371 --> 01:27:05,710
That's what's going to happen. I
mean, it's just a, that's just,

1198
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:10,480
this is the law is the law of the land.
The number one thing to remember is,

1199
01:27:10,481 --> 01:27:11,920
and this is something that's really hard,

1200
01:27:11,921 --> 01:27:15,670
when you're super active and you're super
fired up and you're training all the

1201
01:27:15,671 --> 01:27:18,160
time, when you get injured
and you get sidelined,

1202
01:27:18,460 --> 01:27:22,270
you feel like it's never gonna go away.
It feels like it's not healing.

1203
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:26,330
And you're just like, oh man,
this is, I'm doomed. So the,

1204
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:30,960
the injury is going to wick go away.
Now obviously for some guys, for some,

1205
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:35,560
for some actual soldiers or warriors
that had been wounded in a permanent way,

1206
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:40,060
that's, that's different. And those guys,
what they do is they learn to adapt.

1207
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:43,240
You know, they learn how are
they going to get through this?

1208
01:27:43,241 --> 01:27:47,470
How are they gonna adapt their life?
How are they going to roll with one leg?

1209
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,460
How are they going to do pull ups
with one hand? Uh, Jeffrey Owl,

1210
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:53,950
you know Jeffrey out. Yup.
We're doing a burpee pull ups.

1211
01:27:53,951 --> 01:27:55,930
The other day I was putting
the MMA classes through it.

1212
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:59,890
If you don't know Jeffrey l awesome guy,
awesome fighter, awesome Jujitsu player.

1213
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:01,420
He's born without one hand.

1214
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:05,470
I had the guys doing a burpee pull
ups and black belt by the way. Yeah.

1215
01:28:05,471 --> 01:28:07,480
Black belts.
And he had uh,

1216
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:11,800
he has like a little hook he can put
on there to do pull ups and I guess the

1217
01:28:11,801 --> 01:28:12,880
thing was fallen off.

1218
01:28:13,210 --> 01:28:16,410
And so he just threw that thing to the
ground and he was just hooking his,

1219
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,990
his forearm over and then the other hand
was grabbing. He's doing pull ups. Yeah.

1220
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,840
I mean if,

1221
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:27,780
if Jeffrey owl can just jump
do, we did, I don't know,

1222
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:32,410
six rounds worth of burpee pull ups or
five rounds worth of burpee pull ups. He,

1223
01:28:32,411 --> 01:28:35,830
and he crushed it.
No one has any excuse.

1224
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:39,340
So guys that they get some kind of a
permanent injury, they get wounded.

1225
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:42,290
W something like that happens.
Okay. You got to adapt to it.

1226
01:28:42,291 --> 01:28:44,990
You've got to figure out what you
can do. But the injuries, the,

1227
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:47,560
the basic injuries, the
daily injuries, the,

1228
01:28:48,340 --> 01:28:51,580
the temporary injuries that
is normal from training

1229
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:57,400
that that's you're going to get them.
And so of course,

1230
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:02,400
oh, you got an injury. Good. Right.
It's a little injury. Be Thankful.

1231
01:29:02,401 --> 01:29:06,710
It's not something worse.
You know, I, I've, I've had,
you know, a blown out ankle.

1232
01:29:06,711 --> 01:29:10,290
I've had a torn MCL and you know,
what do you do?

1233
01:29:10,291 --> 01:29:14,440
What do you say when you tear your ACL or
your MCL, you say, okay, awesome. Yeah,

1234
01:29:14,441 --> 01:29:18,720
I did. It's not my ACL, it's
not my meniscus. You know,
the MCL will he itself,

1235
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,380
what do you say? If it's your,
if it is your ACL. Okay, great.

1236
01:29:22,381 --> 01:29:23,940
That's one that can be
repaired with surgery.

1237
01:29:24,090 --> 01:29:27,510
So none of these problems are permanent,
right?

1238
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:29,730
So be thankful you don't
have a permanent injury.

1239
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:31,060
Okay.

1240
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:35,410
And even though it seems like it's going
to take forever, like homeboy here,

1241
01:29:35,411 --> 01:29:38,800
who's got two months before he even gets
surgery and then how long is it going

1242
01:29:38,801 --> 01:29:42,130
to take? It seems like it's going to
take forever. I had neck surgery, right?

1243
01:29:42,770 --> 01:29:45,280
That was a blip on the radar,
if you remember how long it took.

1244
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:47,860
And it was a long time. I mean,
it took months to heal from that.

1245
01:29:47,980 --> 01:29:51,400
I don't remember that when I do,
during that time I did other exercises.

1246
01:29:51,401 --> 01:29:53,140
I figured it out. This stuff.
I watched youtube videos,

1247
01:29:53,141 --> 01:29:54,970
I figured out all the moves,
you know? That's what I did.

1248
01:29:55,720 --> 01:30:00,070
So I guess youtube wasn't even around.
I was watching DVDs,

1249
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:03,820
GGT, DVDs, VHS tapes.

1250
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:08,350
So what do you do? Number one,
stay active. Right? You know,

1251
01:30:08,351 --> 01:30:10,540
move. Do, if you,

1252
01:30:10,541 --> 01:30:15,070
if you can't move your body all
work your forearms. Strength,

1253
01:30:15,460 --> 01:30:20,320
right? Squeeze a tennis ball. One
of my buddies blew out his knee.

1254
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:25,660
What is it? The triple threat.
He did ACL, PCL, meniscus, boom.

1255
01:30:25,690 --> 01:30:27,790
He'll hook right,
didn't tap,

1256
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:32,280
got to adapt to the heel hook people got
attached to it, got caught on a hill.

1257
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:35,860
It didn't tap blue is blue.
It all apart. He was in a,

1258
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,010
he had to get them all
reconstructed. So he, we had a dummy.

1259
01:30:39,011 --> 01:30:41,800
Remember the big dummy we have at the gym?
We had a big one,

1260
01:30:41,801 --> 01:30:45,670
it was 120 pounds and he
would lay on the ground.

1261
01:30:45,671 --> 01:30:49,180
His knee is in a four, has legs and a
fourth street brace won't bend at all.

1262
01:30:49,330 --> 01:30:53,500
He would lay on the ground and in lay
next to this dummy and he just pull it

1263
01:30:53,501 --> 01:30:56,150
from one side of himself, put it on the
ground, on the other side of itself,

1264
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,960
pull it back to the other side, back to
the other side, back to the other side.

1265
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,980
So he's getting this motion of
sort of turning on the ground,

1266
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:06,370
this massive core strength. And
when we, when he finally recovered,

1267
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:11,140
it was powerful. You know what, he would
turn underneath. You said you got some,

1268
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:15,100
got some strength there. So you've got
to figure out what you can do. You know,

1269
01:31:15,101 --> 01:31:16,300
if you can't roll,

1270
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:17,660
yeah,

1271
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:21,410
box.
If you can't box lift,

1272
01:31:21,500 --> 01:31:22,670
if you can't lift,

1273
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:28,100
stretch and get that flexibility working
in some area that you're not flexible,

1274
01:31:28,101 --> 01:31:30,950
what? Whatever you're going to
do. Stay engaged. Stay active.

1275
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:34,550
Because I think I'm definitely
a believer in the active rest.

1276
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,620
You know what I mean? When you
just go, okay, I'm injured,

1277
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:39,710
so I'm just gonna sit on the couch
and watch TV. No wrong answer.

1278
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:41,540
Runaway from that TV,

1279
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,870
you got to keep moving because that
keeps your blood flowing and it keeps

1280
01:31:44,871 --> 01:31:47,120
getting, it gets more
blood, more circulation,

1281
01:31:47,121 --> 01:31:50,060
more healing gives to this area
that's injured. So do that.

1282
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:55,160
And if you're still, you're still gonna
have more time in your day, right?

1283
01:31:55,161 --> 01:31:56,810
So what are you going to do?
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

1284
01:31:57,680 --> 01:31:58,290
Okay?

1285
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:03,070
Get a guitar, right? Learn to play
guitar. Write a book, build a website,

1286
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,520
take pictures, learn a
language, read more books.

1287
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:10,030
Expand your brain,
right?

1288
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:12,940
Expand your mind when your
body needs a little recovery.

1289
01:32:12,941 --> 01:32:16,570
When your body's injured, make
yourself smarter, make yourself better,

1290
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:20,860
free your mind.
And so the bottom line,

1291
01:32:21,820 --> 01:32:26,710
the question was,
what does a man do when there's quiet?

1292
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:31,870
And I'll tell you what a man does when
there's quiet, he takes advantage of it.

1293
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:36,040
So take advantage of it.
Get Smarter, get better.

1294
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:40,330
You know the ways and when the body comes
back you'll, you will be better. Yeah.

1295
01:32:40,331 --> 01:32:44,380
That's a good way to put it. Like
take advantage of it. Like actively.

1296
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:47,860
Cause a lot of times like
where the problem comes about.

1297
01:32:47,861 --> 01:32:51,010
I know this because when I told I told
my bicep. That's right. I wasn't there.

1298
01:32:51,070 --> 01:32:54,050
I was watching the out. Yeah. Well
yeah. Thank you. Yeah, I was fine.

1299
01:32:54,310 --> 01:32:57,930
I have a picture of you. Yeah. That was
laying on the ground. That was messed up.

1300
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:01,180
I think you sent me a smarmy
techs or something like that. No,

1301
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:05,560
that was for something else. But the
same day though, nonetheless, what,

1302
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:08,110
where the problem comes
when you miss the story,

1303
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:10,780
you miss the action is
you're harping on it.

1304
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:14,130
It's almost like you have this
hope like, oh, it'll be stolen.

1305
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:16,990
Or maybe the doctor said nine months,

1306
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:20,170
but maybe I could do it in four
kind of thing. You know, they just,

1307
01:33:20,171 --> 01:33:24,910
that mindset where you kind of in a
way got admit to yourself, okay, I'm,

1308
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,510
I'm out right now.
I can't roll right now.

1309
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:32,710
I can't train MMA two times a day,
five days a week. I cannot do that.

1310
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,080
You got to admit that.
So where did you go?

1311
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:37,090
Did you work on your video editing skills
during that time? Oh man, that was,

1312
01:33:37,091 --> 01:33:41,440
I think that was before,
or what'd you do? I forget.

1313
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:44,030
I don't know, but I'll
tell you, do not take it.

1314
01:33:44,040 --> 01:33:46,690
Tell you what I didn't do is harp on it.

1315
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:50,060
He moved on and you figured out what
else you can do. Yeah, exactly right.

1316
01:33:50,061 --> 01:33:51,940
In my back,
I was always into working out and stuff,

1317
01:33:51,941 --> 01:33:56,630
so I would do other stuff like legs and
stuff. Like your left arm. Hello? Yeah.

1318
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:00,280
Yeah. Actually my left arm is still
bigger a little bit. Nonetheless.

1319
01:34:00,281 --> 01:34:01,290
I think that that's,

1320
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,530
that's a good little jumpstart is don't
harp on it and you got to admit to

1321
01:34:05,531 --> 01:34:08,230
yourself that you're, you're out.
You're injured right now. So,

1322
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:10,810
and then how you said take
advantage of it. Dang, that's good.

1323
01:34:10,811 --> 01:34:11,860
I wish I would've known that.

1324
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:14,620
Actively take advantage because
there's so much advantage to be taken.

1325
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:17,170
There's all kinds of
time you have. Yeah, man.

1326
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,910
I think about all the time that I
spend in the gym and all the maths.

1327
01:34:19,911 --> 01:34:24,030
I mean that's a budge big chuck of time.
Now like with,

1328
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,670
with reading for example,
it got back into reading and um,

1329
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:33,640
look, I look at it this way where as
far as books go, books that exist,

1330
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:37,310
any information in the whole, whether
you're interested in it, not interested,

1331
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:38,650
whether you can understand it or not,

1332
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:43,630
all the information of the
world is accessible right now,

1333
01:34:43,631 --> 01:34:48,520
especially more than anytime ever.
All different angles,

1334
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:52,540
different aspects of everything is just
out there and you have more time now.

1335
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:57,980
Take advantage of that actively.
Actively. All. Alright, next question.

1336
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,380
My question is this,
as a military man,

1337
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:07,460
what do you do if you can not reconcile
the orders that you're asked to do?

1338
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:13,160
I know that in your book you talk about
believe the mission and how you must ask

1339
01:35:13,161 --> 01:35:17,390
questions until you believe what happens
if after all the questions and all the

1340
01:35:17,391 --> 01:35:20,750
expectation as explanations
that you don't agree or believe.

1341
01:35:21,650 --> 01:35:22,460
What if the policies,

1342
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:26,810
the politics asks of you something
you're not congruent with.

1343
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:30,970
How do you as a military men
respond to you're incongruent see

1344
01:35:31,950 --> 01:35:32,783
with the mission.

1345
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:41,190
So this is a great question and, and, and

1346
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,340
you know what's kind of ties in with
what we just read with the book review of

1347
01:35:46,341 --> 01:35:50,030
Machete sees and how
people were just doing it.

1348
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,550
Some of them didn't believe in what
they're doing. They did it anyways.

1349
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:57,770
Wrong answer. Um, Danny resulted in
the death of the one guy, you know,

1350
01:35:57,771 --> 01:36:01,920
you talk about her, the, that's
in the book, but you know,

1351
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:05,840
so first of all, as you, as you
stated in the question itself,

1352
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,560
if you don't agree with some
mission that you've been given,

1353
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:14,870
then you have to ask the question
why in the book extreme ownership,

1354
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:16,550
we talk about that.

1355
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:19,730
The primary example is we talk about
is working with Iraqi soldiers.

1356
01:36:19,731 --> 01:36:23,270
And how that's very challenging and
very difficult and very dangerous.

1357
01:36:23,780 --> 01:36:27,350
And the story that we tell in the book
is that I, I said to myself, okay,

1358
01:36:27,351 --> 01:36:29,150
why are they having us work with,
he's Iraqi soldiers,

1359
01:36:29,151 --> 01:36:31,460
my guys are going to be at
risk, et Cetera, et cetera.

1360
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:36,530
And eventually I realized why we needed
to do this was because if we didn't get

1361
01:36:36,531 --> 01:36:40,790
the Iraqi soldiers to a point where
they could handle the security in Iraq,

1362
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:43,910
then who's going to do it? And the
answer was us. So I understood why.

1363
01:36:44,330 --> 01:36:48,230
Now I actually don't even have to
ask anybody why I figured that out.

1364
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:52,580
I asked myself why and so I was able
to come to it, come to that conclusion.

1365
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,760
But when you are a part of something,

1366
01:36:56,820 --> 01:36:57,290
okay

1367
01:36:57,290 --> 01:37:01,880
with whether it's in business,
awards in war, the goal,

1368
01:37:01,881 --> 01:37:03,320
the ultimate goal,

1369
01:37:03,710 --> 01:37:08,450
it has to be aligned and in it.
So for example,

1370
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:12,080
we're in Iraq, we're supposed
to use Iraqi soldiers. Okay.

1371
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:17,570
Do you think that the generals wanted
our med to be killed because of the,

1372
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:21,560
the higher risk? No, they wanted to win
the war. They want to keep our guys safe.

1373
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,630
So that's what I want it to.
We want to win the war.

1374
01:37:23,631 --> 01:37:25,460
We want to keep our guys
safe so that's aligned.

1375
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,350
So anything that they're telling me to do,

1376
01:37:28,190 --> 01:37:33,190
it must be at some point in the distance
aligned with the same goal that I have.

1377
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,540
And it's the same thing with a business.

1378
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,260
Do you think a boss of a business doesn't
want to be profitable or doesn't want

1379
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:40,280
to be ethical?
No.

1380
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:43,910
Somewhere in the future they want to be
profitable and they want to be ethical

1381
01:37:43,911 --> 01:37:46,820
and somewhere your mission
is going to align with that.

1382
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,570
If you don't,

1383
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:53,330
if those don't align at some point,

1384
01:37:53,331 --> 01:37:56,310
then you've got a real serious
issue on your hands. Right?

1385
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,960
Because maybe you're being told to do
something that you just don't believe in

1386
01:38:02,360 --> 01:38:04,050
at you at first. You know, like I said,

1387
01:38:04,051 --> 01:38:07,500
you've got to ask those questions all
the way up and if you do ask those

1388
01:38:07,501 --> 01:38:10,440
questions all the way up
and you still find, okay,

1389
01:38:10,441 --> 01:38:12,360
I don't believe in this mission.

1390
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:20,110
Now you got a way out.
The consequences. Because,

1391
01:38:21,980 --> 01:38:22,521
for instance,

1392
01:38:22,521 --> 01:38:25,940
if there is an order that comes and for
whatever reason you don't believe in it,

1393
01:38:25,941 --> 01:38:28,550
and you've asked the questions and you
still don't believe that it's the right

1394
01:38:28,551 --> 01:38:32,780
thing to do. But what if it's something
that's like pretty inconsequential, right?

1395
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:37,840
Something that's no big
deal and you say no to it.

1396
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,660
Like I'm not going to do this. You
decide to make your stand, okay,

1397
01:38:41,661 --> 01:38:44,780
well now you are your,
first of all,

1398
01:38:44,781 --> 01:38:47,330
you're not supporting the
chain of command anymore.

1399
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:49,880
And if you're not supporting
your chain of command anymore,

1400
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:52,100
how can you support the
guys that work for you?

1401
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:53,273
Hmm.

1402
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:54,550
Because now,

1403
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:59,550
now you might get removed and if you
get removed from the situation now,

1404
01:39:01,241 --> 01:39:02,440
who's going to go execute it?

1405
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:05,740
Who's going to go do this thing
that you thought was wrong?

1406
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:09,400
Now you're going to give it to somebody
that might execute it in a harsher way,

1407
01:39:09,401 --> 01:39:14,080
in a worse way or, or you lose control
of it. You've lost your influence,

1408
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:15,940
your use of some of
your political capital.

1409
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:19,330
You've impaired your reputation by saying,
no,

1410
01:39:19,331 --> 01:39:22,060
I'm not gonna do that because I don't
believe in it. Well, what was it?

1411
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:26,770
And by saying, no, what
did you accomplish?

1412
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:32,350
Because now you have no control
over in, the more you're, you're,

1413
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:36,360
you can't change it, you can't affect
it any more. So let me ask you this.

1414
01:39:36,390 --> 01:39:38,950
This is an example. This will make
it very clear what I'm trying to say,

1415
01:39:38,951 --> 01:39:42,370
cause I don't think I'm being very clear
right now. If you're playing a game,

1416
01:39:42,490 --> 01:39:42,791
right?

1417
01:39:42,791 --> 01:39:46,990
You're playing a football
game or a basketball game
and the ref makes a bad call.

1418
01:39:48,460 --> 01:39:52,900
Okay? So you say ref made a bad
call. I don't agree with this call.

1419
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:54,490
I quit.
I'm walking off the court

1420
01:39:56,210 --> 01:39:57,043
now.

1421
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:02,090
Does that make sense? I mean,
how bad of a call was it?

1422
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:05,840
How did it affect the game? And, and
furthermore, once you walk off the court,

1423
01:40:05,841 --> 01:40:09,560
what good are you? Can you,
can you do better? Can use,

1424
01:40:09,561 --> 01:40:13,310
try and bring back the score.
Can you try and show the ref that yes,

1425
01:40:13,311 --> 01:40:15,650
you are playing fair. Look, I'm
a good guy and keeping my head.

1426
01:40:15,651 --> 01:40:18,800
I'm keeping my cool.
Now you've thrown that all away.

1427
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,970
You've thrown that all the way.
And so what good is that?

1428
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:24,890
It's the same thing and not to the ref,

1429
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:27,950
cause that's sort of outside your chain
of command. But what if your own coach,

1430
01:40:28,010 --> 01:40:33,010
what if your coach pulls you out of a
game or a coach calls a play to you for

1431
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:35,120
you to run a play that you didn't
believe in? So you're going to say,

1432
01:40:35,121 --> 01:40:37,370
you know what? I don't believe in
that play. I'm walking off the field.

1433
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:40,880
That's an exact correlation to this idea,
right?

1434
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:44,540
This military order comes
down that I don't believe in.
Oh, I don't believe in it.

1435
01:40:44,541 --> 01:40:45,380
So now I'm going to walk away.

1436
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,550
Right?
So

1437
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:53,530
that is is problematic because you've,

1438
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:58,480
you've given up, you've surrendered
your right to affect the situation.

1439
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:00,400
Yeah.

1440
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:03,700
And that's,
that's not good.

1441
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:05,800
And in the military there's
all kinds of little, you know,

1442
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:10,060
policy nuances that we might not
believe in 100%, little things.

1443
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,000
There might be little things that you
go, you know what? I don't, I don't see,

1444
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:14,290
I don't think that's
the best way to do it.

1445
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:18,580
Or I think there's a better way to do it.
But if you walk away from it now,

1446
01:41:18,581 --> 01:41:23,140
you can no longer affect it and
that is bad. So generally speaking,

1447
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:28,030
for most of these things you,
I dealt,

1448
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:30,940
dealt with in the military all the time,
dealt with it all the time.

1449
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,500
And you know what?
Generally speaking,

1450
01:41:32,501 --> 01:41:36,550
you stay in the game so that you can
still have an effect and can still have

1451
01:41:36,551 --> 01:41:40,690
influence.
Now that being said,

1452
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:47,510
there can be orders that
are on lawful or unethical.

1453
01:41:51,510 --> 01:41:54,390
That can't happen, right? If
you are in a bad situation,

1454
01:41:54,391 --> 01:41:55,350
you're working for a bad commander,

1455
01:41:55,351 --> 01:41:57,570
you're working for someone that's
unethical or whatever the case may be.

1456
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:04,470
It may be their orders are plans that
are tactically on the sound to the point

1457
01:42:04,471 --> 01:42:06,150
that you're afraid
people are going to die.

1458
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:10,880
And, and in those situations, you know,

1459
01:42:10,881 --> 01:42:13,790
as we were rolling back to Napoleon's
maximum, again, if you knew,

1460
01:42:13,791 --> 01:42:16,640
execute something that you knew was wrong,
you're comparable.

1461
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:20,360
So that is a time when you stand up and
say, you know what? I'm not doing this.

1462
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,600
You want to send me to Leavenworth? Do
you want to demote me, demote me, do it.

1463
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:26,390
But I did not believe in this.
And here's why.

1464
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:31,750
So that is a time where
you may have to say,

1465
01:42:31,761 --> 01:42:35,540
after you weigh out the situation, how
bad is it? Something that's unethical,

1466
01:42:35,570 --> 01:42:37,130
unconstitutional,

1467
01:42:37,850 --> 01:42:42,850
and you think you're going to have a
bigger impact by protesting it by possibly

1468
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:48,590
jeopardizing your career or
possibly going to go on 11 worth.

1469
01:42:48,591 --> 01:42:51,080
If you're in the military,
getting court martialed,

1470
01:42:51,081 --> 01:42:56,000
all those things could happen if you
think that it's so important and that you

1471
01:42:56,001 --> 01:43:00,140
will have a better effect on it by
making this protest because that's what

1472
01:43:00,141 --> 01:43:04,520
you're doing.
You're now making a protest then okay,

1473
01:43:04,610 --> 01:43:05,750
maybe that makes sense.

1474
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:09,500
So you've got like the Mei Lai
massacre in Vietnam were horrible.

1475
01:43:09,501 --> 01:43:12,110
Situation happens. And if you were
a soldier that was there and said,

1476
01:43:12,111 --> 01:43:14,870
you know what,
I'm not doing this stop.

1477
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:18,800
And maybe maybe you do rest and court
martialed maybe risk getting killed.

1478
01:43:20,030 --> 01:43:24,890
But that's a situation where maybe you
do it or maybe it's some mistreatment of

1479
01:43:24,891 --> 01:43:29,150
civilians or something. But again,
even with mistreatment of civilians,

1480
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:32,780
the u s military is not going to
order the mistreatment of civilians.

1481
01:43:32,781 --> 01:43:35,690
It's not going to happen,
right? So if it is happening,

1482
01:43:35,691 --> 01:43:40,691
it's coming from a rogue commander
that's you're going to be able to destroy

1483
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,000
when you bring this situation to the,

1484
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,280
to the authorities or to
the higher chain of command.

1485
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:50,870
So again,
you know,

1486
01:43:50,871 --> 01:43:54,470
if getting wrapped up in
some small nuanced thing,

1487
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:57,200
he mentions the Poli,
the political,

1488
01:43:57,201 --> 01:43:59,060
like if you're not
politically congruent with,

1489
01:43:59,061 --> 01:44:03,020
I don't know if you meant
that split. Yeah. And again,
when you're in the military,

1490
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:06,810
you're, you're not there to, um,

1491
01:44:07,340 --> 01:44:11,900
worry about the politics of it. You know,
you're there to carry out the politics.

1492
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,170
You're there to carry out the
policy. Now if there's a Po, again,

1493
01:44:15,171 --> 01:44:17,960
if the policy is agregious, right, right.

1494
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:22,640
If it's a green adjusts and you
think you would do better to,

1495
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:27,350
to make a protest and end
up in jail and you know,

1496
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,470
be on CNN and Fox News and saying,
Hey,

1497
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:32,780
this is why I'm in jail because I
didn't agree with what we're doing.

1498
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,630
If it's something that the rest of the
nation is going to look at and say, yeah,

1499
01:44:35,631 --> 01:44:37,880
this guy was right.
Right, of course. Yeah.

1500
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:40,850
But if you're doing it
because it's something that

1501
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,340
is in comparison to that is
something relatively small.

1502
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,400
Okay,

1503
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:52,230
then you're probably, you're probably
doing worse to help the situation.

1504
01:44:52,410 --> 01:44:55,740
You're probably doing
less good by walking away,

1505
01:44:55,741 --> 01:44:58,420
getting off the field and letting,
letting the,

1506
01:44:58,540 --> 01:45:03,240
the situation transpire without
your presence. I want to be there.

1507
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:05,790
Yeah. You know, I want to be there. If I,

1508
01:45:05,791 --> 01:45:08,640
if my guys were getting tasked with a
mission that I thought was a little bit

1509
01:45:08,641 --> 01:45:13,440
sketchy, I want to be there. Yeah.
I want to be there. Not, hey,

1510
01:45:13,441 --> 01:45:17,310
I protest, so I'm not going to
go [inaudible] not a good call.

1511
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,120
So, um, yeah, and, and again,

1512
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:25,860
I'm not saying that you don't stand by
your principles, but what I'm saying is,

1513
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:27,570
especially if this guy
that's in the military,

1514
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:32,070
your principles should be for the
most part in line, this is America.

1515
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:36,930
And if you're, if you're, if you're
being told to do something that's,

1516
01:45:37,560 --> 01:45:41,460
that's UNAMERICAN, then yeah.
Stand by your principles. But most,

1517
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:44,730
if it's something that's small and it's
something that you just might not agree

1518
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:48,240
with, 100%, it doesn't mean
you're an unprincipled person.

1519
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:53,070
It means that you are winning,
losing the battle,

1520
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:57,120
but you're going to win the war. Yeah.
Yeah. I liked that way. Weigh it out.

1521
01:45:57,150 --> 01:46:00,300
You know, everything's not
black and white. That bothers
me. I'm jumping on the,

1522
01:46:00,301 --> 01:46:02,370
you know,
on that side of things.

1523
01:46:04,710 --> 01:46:05,543
Yeah.

1524
01:46:06,100 --> 01:46:10,790
Next question,
Jocko and echo.

1525
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:15,200
What supplements do you guys take
besides Krill oil and Alpha brain

1526
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:19,850
in d?
Take the Alpha brain instant or capsules.

1527
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:26,610
I take Alpha brain instant. It's tasty
treat. It's got a little statistic,

1528
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:30,150
which it's got a little sweetness to
it, uh, cause it's got Stevia in it,

1529
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:30,990
so it tastes good.
If you,

1530
01:46:30,991 --> 01:46:33,300
if you have a little bit of a sweet tooth
and wants something sweet and you've

1531
01:46:33,301 --> 01:46:37,640
been eating like steak for
the past seven days, mmm.

1532
01:46:37,930 --> 01:46:42,060
Tastes good. I also take glucosomine
as I've mentioned before. Uh,

1533
01:46:42,510 --> 01:46:46,080
I do get it from on it. It's a product
called strong bone. That's what I,

1534
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:49,850
that's what I take. And I'll tell you, I,

1535
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:54,480
I the getting ready for the
podcast, right. Doing prep work,

1536
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,220
like three days in a row,

1537
01:46:56,460 --> 01:47:00,960
I was deep in prep work
and I was pounding some,

1538
01:47:01,080 --> 01:47:03,960
some Alpha brain and
each, each dance. Yeah.

1539
01:47:03,961 --> 01:47:08,160
I was like drinking the full Alpha
brains and maybe like two of them.

1540
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,840
And,
and I,

1541
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:15,060
I had directed the two days in a row
and when I went into train and I trained

1542
01:47:15,061 --> 01:47:18,090
with Dean deans getting ready
for something right now,

1543
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:23,510
and I was rolling really
good with Dean each day.

1544
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:27,510
I was, you know, I was doing
well. He has, I was like, dude,

1545
01:47:27,511 --> 01:47:31,620
it was doing well and dean was,
Dean was not a happy camper.

1546
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,530
And then the third day was like,

1547
01:47:34,531 --> 01:47:38,570
I was pretty much done with wrapped up
the prep and I didn't have any Alpha and

1548
01:47:38,580 --> 01:47:43,080
I had a rough day and I, I said to
myself, maybe there's a little slot there.

1549
01:47:43,140 --> 01:47:47,820
Causation, I don't know,
maybe, but, uh, yeah.

1550
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:52,480
And I suppose you want to throw out
some shroom tech. Yeah. Shroom tech. Um,

1551
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,600
of course, like I've always said,
um, again, even before this I was,

1552
01:47:57,601 --> 01:48:02,160
I took from tech. That was good. That's
a good one. Oh, the preworkout sometimes,

1553
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:04,380
you know, we'll actually
all the time, if you,

1554
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:08,700
if you really want to feel like
working out, you know, like, like, Hey,

1555
01:48:08,701 --> 01:48:11,580
I feel like working out right now.
You'll always feel like that.

1556
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:14,880
You feel like that takes some
pre workout with the Alpha brain.

1557
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:19,860
Instant mix them together.
Boom, Gatorade, boom. Yeah. Um,

1558
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:23,520
as far as the Alpha brain
instant versus the capsules, and

1559
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:29,640
my brother has verified this, I'd
never taken, I've taken the capsules,

1560
01:48:29,641 --> 01:48:30,480
but not before I go to sleep.

1561
01:48:30,481 --> 01:48:33,150
I hear that if you take the
capsules before you go to sleep,

1562
01:48:33,510 --> 01:48:35,940
cause I don't think there's like any
kind of caffeine or nothing in Alphago.

1563
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,300
There's not so take it
before you go to sleep,

1564
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:43,110
you get 'em lucid dreams,
lucid dreams. I've heard that.

1565
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:46,710
I've heard that from everybody.
Everybody who takes Alpha brain,

1566
01:48:46,860 --> 01:48:48,510
they say that it affects the dream.

1567
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:52,650
I don't want my dreams to be any
more real than they are actually.

1568
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:54,780
But do you know that
you're dreaming when you,

1569
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:57,450
when you saw three dream
situation? Sometimes. Yeah.

1570
01:48:57,451 --> 01:48:59,820
Apparently like this a little bit.
A lot of times my dreams are just blank,

1571
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:03,870
but I wake up and you know, complete full
athletic, sweat drenched bed. That's,

1572
01:49:03,910 --> 01:49:08,900
that's how I wake up.
It's not fun. Yeah. Um,

1573
01:49:08,940 --> 01:49:13,320
but in regards to like protein powder
or nothing like this, uh, steak.

1574
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:17,730
Yes. I said it before and I'll say it
again. Yeah. I think that's a big deal.

1575
01:49:17,731 --> 01:49:19,040
Like a lot of people, you know, people,

1576
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:22,620
some people were really into supplements
like Toby. Yeah. The new, this,

1577
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,590
the new protein powder because it comes
with this delivery system and all this

1578
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:30,560
stuff. Um, dual action protein. Yeah. You
know, all this other stuff. And it does,

1579
01:49:30,920 --> 01:49:34,540
um, like if you eat food that, yeah,

1580
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:38,130
just normal food that has a good
delivery system that is to tell you that

1581
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:39,070
actually,

1582
01:49:39,070 --> 01:49:43,040
especially when it's in the form of a
Ribeye steaks and great delivery system

1583
01:49:43,041 --> 01:49:46,860
right there. Yeah. I would
imagine so. But yeah, that's it.

1584
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:48,790
Not that heavy into the supplements.

1585
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:53,090
Um, maybe a multivitamin
from time to time. Okay.

1586
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:58,660
I don't really take a multivitamin. Yeah.
Yeah, I did for awhile. I don't anymore.

1587
01:50:00,010 --> 01:50:04,360
Yeah. Um, Krill oil. Alpha
brain. Yeah, it's it.

1588
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:07,143
Next question.

1589
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:13,000
I'm a Kentucky Trooper and I'm
an instructor at our academy,

1590
01:50:13,180 --> 01:50:17,770
the police academy. We lost three guys
last year. Could you discuss how it,

1591
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:22,000
how to deal with training these guys
as hard as you can and they still lose

1592
01:50:22,001 --> 01:50:23,350
their lives while working.

1593
01:50:23,740 --> 01:50:27,510
So it's the dealing with people
and letting them know that um,

1594
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:28,783
hm

1595
01:50:29,870 --> 01:50:33,980
that this goes down.
Know How do you do with that?

1596
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:36,490
Well, first of all, um,

1597
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:42,160
I eat a lot of feedback from police
officers out there in the world and if I

1598
01:50:42,161 --> 01:50:46,630
would say one thing to them to lead
this office, thank you for what you do.

1599
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:50,500
You guys have a dangerous job.
It's intense,

1600
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:54,220
it's thankless most of the time
and you're dealing with the,

1601
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:58,330
with the dregs of society all day long.

1602
01:50:58,331 --> 01:51:01,930
And then you have to balance that
with dealing with normal civilians and

1603
01:51:01,931 --> 01:51:04,320
citizens. So, uh,

1604
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:09,190
thank you for what you guys do.
And also I'll throw on top of that.

1605
01:51:09,620 --> 01:51:14,230
Firefighters, you know,
paramedics. Thank you guys.

1606
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:18,400
For what you do. And
again, thankless job, um,

1607
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:24,010
difficult job,
dangerous job where people,

1608
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:28,390
you're helping people that don't want
to help themselves in many cases.

1609
01:51:28,450 --> 01:51:32,290
So thanks for everybody.
Thanks for all those,

1610
01:51:32,380 --> 01:51:36,070
those first responders for
what you guys do. Yeah. Um,

1611
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:41,880
now as far as training guys hard and
then you still get guys that get killed

1612
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:50,200
blessing. But let me ask you
this. What is the alternative?

1613
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:55,520
Right? Well, what are you going to
do? Not Train hard. Um, you know,

1614
01:51:55,640 --> 01:52:00,640
I had the first deals that were killed
in Iraq were killed under my command.

1615
01:52:01,431 --> 01:52:04,250
There were my guys, mark, Mark Lee,

1616
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:06,890
Mikey Mon store and Ryan Job.

1617
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:12,890
And we trained as hard as possible
and we still took those casualties.

1618
01:52:12,891 --> 01:52:13,311
I'm telling you,

1619
01:52:13,311 --> 01:52:18,311
we trained as hard as possible and if it
wasn't for lack of training or lack of

1620
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:20,960
planning or lack of skill,

1621
01:52:22,430 --> 01:52:23,263
okay.

1622
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:24,970
It's the nature of combat

1623
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:31,500
eats the risk of conducting
operations in a hostile environment.

1624
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:32,111
And I'll tell you what,

1625
01:52:32,111 --> 01:52:36,820
when I got back to America and I took
over the training for the west coast seal

1626
01:52:36,821 --> 01:52:39,340
teams,
that fact,

1627
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:45,310
that fact of losing my guys in combat,

1628
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:50,500
it made me fanatical about trading.

1629
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:55,250
And I was already fanatical about
training, but it multiplied it infinitely.

1630
01:52:56,310 --> 01:52:57,000
Okay.

1631
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:01,980
Because now it became my
mission to prepare these guys,

1632
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:06,390
the apps to the absolute best of my
ability and get them ready for combat.

1633
01:53:08,130 --> 01:53:12,690
In part of that preparation was making
them understand what was at risk.

1634
01:53:12,990 --> 01:53:16,860
And I think that's something
that you should do here.

1635
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:19,830
You know,

1636
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:22,710
you don't know what's going to happen
when you go into the field and you don't

1637
01:53:22,711 --> 01:53:23,760
know when it's gonna happen.

1638
01:53:23,761 --> 01:53:28,761
So everything you do should be to prepare
yourself mentally and physically for

1639
01:53:29,071 --> 01:53:30,690
the moment of truth.

1640
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:35,780
Whether that happens at a traffic stop
or while you're serving a warrant and why

1641
01:53:36,151 --> 01:53:39,630
you're stopping a bank robbery,
you don't know when it is going to happen.

1642
01:53:40,350 --> 01:53:41,880
And so you got to tell these guys,

1643
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,170
tell them the truth of the danger
and let it sink in and hound on it.

1644
01:53:49,830 --> 01:53:54,000
And I, I, I tell this story from
time and I was telling you a story.

1645
01:53:54,001 --> 01:53:57,960
It's a statement and it's
because I remember this feeling.

1646
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:03,090
Then it was when I got back
from Ramadi and we were doing,

1647
01:54:03,091 --> 01:54:08,091
we'd be doing urban training and I would
see a guy like standing in the street

1648
01:54:09,721 --> 01:54:12,690
standing in the middle of the street,
which is, which is not a good move, right?

1649
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:13,770
That's where bullets fly down.

1650
01:54:13,771 --> 01:54:16,020
You're going to get shot if you're in
the Middle Street and it happen all the

1651
01:54:16,021 --> 01:54:20,790
time to guys and Ramadi and I would
see a guy that will be standing in the

1652
01:54:20,791 --> 01:54:23,250
street and I would literally feel sick.

1653
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:27,090
It was only for about maybe six
to nine months after I got back.

1654
01:54:27,091 --> 01:54:29,580
When I'd gone to the training side,
I would feel sick to my stomach.

1655
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:34,110
I would just feel this horrible feeling
because it was like I was waiting for

1656
01:54:34,111 --> 01:54:35,460
something to be,

1657
01:54:35,900 --> 01:54:40,720
I was waiting for him to get shot
and he felt horrible and I wore,

1658
01:54:40,750 --> 01:54:45,750
my goal was to transfer that
feeling into their heads.

1659
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:47,820
I wanted them to feel sick.

1660
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:52,821
I wanted them to feel embarrassed and
feel guilty and feel angry and feel

1661
01:54:53,041 --> 01:54:56,940
disappointed that they were doing
something wrong because I wanted them to

1662
01:54:56,941 --> 01:54:59,190
change their behavior,

1663
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,360
which would keep them alive.

1664
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,770
So I would say in this
case, whew, you've got,

1665
01:55:10,190 --> 01:55:14,030
you're putting people through training,
valuable training,

1666
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:17,900
and of course there's still going
to go out and do a dangerous job,

1667
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,410
but you don't back off the training,

1668
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:26,540
you train harder and you
use these guys again.

1669
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:27,530
God bless him.

1670
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:33,640
You use these guys that were
killed in action as an example of,

1671
01:55:34,071 --> 01:55:37,670
hey guys, this is why we're training
hard. This is why we're going to push.

1672
01:55:37,880 --> 01:55:42,880
This is why I want you to take
personal responsibility for and for

1673
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:47,820
your training and for your
skill set so that you're ready.

1674
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:53,773
Yeah.

1675
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:58,740
You train how you fight and
you fight how you train.

1676
01:56:01,730 --> 01:56:05,060
So take advantage of that and be ready.

1677
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:12,500
Yeah. And a lot of times that, that
pain of, um, you know, any kind of fail,

1678
01:56:12,501 --> 01:56:15,550
in this case, it's an extreme
case. Losing your guys. You know,

1679
01:56:15,551 --> 01:56:19,250
you guys are going through these
extreme cases, um, and that, you know,

1680
01:56:19,251 --> 01:56:23,500
so there's a spectrum of, you know, of
cases, but any kind of failure or, or,

1681
01:56:23,620 --> 01:56:25,990
or mishap that causes any kind of pain.

1682
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:27,330
Okay.

1683
01:56:27,330 --> 01:56:29,340
You can, and it's not easy. It's not easy,

1684
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:34,460
but you can use that pain to facilitate
your passion in a corrective way.

1685
01:56:35,581 --> 01:56:37,170
You know, I was like,
how you say train harder.

1686
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:40,320
You can take that pain
and literally focus on

1687
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,920
good ways of training, training, hard,

1688
01:56:43,921 --> 01:56:48,900
being attached to the results of training
you're in or the process of training.

1689
01:56:49,230 --> 01:56:52,520
Yeah. You know, and it, and it'll, you
get essentially you can use that pain,

1690
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:54,050
you know? Absolutely. You,

1691
01:56:54,051 --> 01:56:58,690
you get a guy that's an MMA fighter
that loses to a submission hold, right.

1692
01:56:59,010 --> 01:57:01,590
You take that and you say, okay, but
you've got to work though Jujitsu.

1693
01:57:01,591 --> 01:57:04,710
You take a guy that's gets his legs
kicked out from underneath him. Okay,

1694
01:57:04,711 --> 01:57:05,640
you got to work.
You're more tired.

1695
01:57:05,641 --> 01:57:09,840
So you take those painful
training experiences and
you put them, like you said,

1696
01:57:09,841 --> 01:57:12,320
you put them to work. Absolutely.
Yeah. In the, in a lot of times,

1697
01:57:12,510 --> 01:57:15,480
a lot of times that'll come naturally
a lot of times, but it doesn't always.

1698
01:57:15,481 --> 01:57:20,310
So in those cases, you can just, just
actively and consciously take that pain,

1699
01:57:20,311 --> 01:57:23,720
you know, and, and redirect it. You
can do it. You can do that fully,

1700
01:57:23,730 --> 01:57:25,620
even if it doesn't come
natural and it helps.

1701
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:29,483
Yeah.

1702
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:34,350
Okay. Jacqueline, any advice? Um, you
have to continue to work out at 4:30 AM

1703
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:40,530
but with two newborn twins at home because
the struggle to stay awake and real.

1704
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:48,460
Awesome question. And,
well, I have four kids.

1705
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:52,570
The first three of them were
born in pretty rapid succession,

1706
01:57:52,571 --> 01:57:55,510
not quite twins obviously,
but you know,

1707
01:57:55,511 --> 01:57:59,710
we had at one point we had
three kids under three. So yeah,

1708
01:57:59,711 --> 01:58:04,630
we're getting after it.
And, uh, now part of that,

1709
01:58:04,631 --> 01:58:08,680
I got to, in full disclosure,
I, you know, I was, uh,

1710
01:58:08,740 --> 01:58:11,500
deployed a fair amount,
but

1711
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:17,510
when you got those young kids, here's
what you gotta do, you gotta get it done.

1712
01:58:18,650 --> 01:58:19,790
You got to get it done.

1713
01:58:19,791 --> 01:58:24,791
And this idea that you're going to
get it done on some pattern or some

1714
01:58:25,461 --> 01:58:29,470
structured time schedule. It's
gonna. It's gonna fall apart. Yeah,

1715
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:34,600
and you got to both sleep and working
out and every other thing that you're

1716
01:58:34,911 --> 01:58:36,080
trying to get done in your life,

1717
01:58:36,140 --> 01:58:38,790
you have to make it happen when
you can make it happen, right.

1718
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:41,770
You know you have to make it happen.
When can make it happen,

1719
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,330
there's going to be no ideal time.

1720
01:58:43,630 --> 01:58:46,960
You might be working out at
three o'clock in the morning.

1721
01:58:46,990 --> 01:58:48,820
You might be working out
at seven o'clock at night.

1722
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:52,030
You might be working out at midnight.
You might be trying to sleep at noon.

1723
01:58:52,090 --> 01:58:53,140
You don't know what's going to happen.

1724
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:58,090
I would definitely say when
you got the young kids,

1725
01:58:58,120 --> 01:59:01,990
get some kind of a home gym set up.
At least get a pullup bar.

1726
01:59:01,991 --> 01:59:05,150
At least get yourself a pullup bar.
Because if you have a pull up bar,

1727
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,180
you can do everything. You can do
pull ups. Then you can do push ups.

1728
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:09,970
You can do squats, you can do sprints.
You can, you can make stuff work.

1729
01:59:09,971 --> 01:59:13,990
If you at least have a pullup bar and
then you just got to squeeze it in there.

1730
01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:18,400
You know, it's a half an hour there. It's
20 minutes here, it's 15 minutes there.

1731
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:21,340
It's a power nap in the afternoon.

1732
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:23,800
It's some squats while you're
sitting there holding a baby,

1733
01:59:23,801 --> 01:59:26,890
trying to get the baby to fall asleep.
That's what it is.

1734
01:59:26,891 --> 01:59:31,891
It's the stroller to the
park with a chalk bag.

1735
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:34,270
So when you get there,
you can do some pull ups on the swing set.

1736
01:59:34,420 --> 01:59:39,220
That's what it becomes because life is
going to have a vote in these situations

1737
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:44,620
and your kids and your family

1738
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:48,730
are more important than you are.

1739
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:54,750
And that's something that is a tough
reality for the young dads to face.

1740
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:02,890
All of a sudden you are not the most
important thing in the world at all.

1741
02:00:04,100 --> 02:00:05,990
They are more important than you are.

1742
02:00:08,220 --> 02:00:12,480
That being said, which I know I'm
supposed to, uh, pay some kind of a fine.

1743
02:00:12,481 --> 02:00:16,440
When I say that being said,
somebody on Twitter hassled me about it.

1744
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:19,440
That being said,
so your kids are more important than you.

1745
02:00:19,441 --> 02:00:22,140
Your family's more important to
you. That being said, guess what?

1746
02:00:22,141 --> 02:00:26,130
The number one thing you need
to do for them, stay healthy.

1747
02:00:26,690 --> 02:00:27,810
You got to stay healthy.

1748
02:00:27,960 --> 02:00:32,960
You can't get all outta shape and turn
into a bum just because you got kids.

1749
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:37,260
They're looking to you to be able
to provide for them for a long time.

1750
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:41,310
They're also looking at you as an example.
That's a big one.

1751
02:00:41,311 --> 02:00:43,380
So you gotta be the right kind of example,

1752
02:00:43,530 --> 02:00:45,600
and physical fitness is
part of that example.

1753
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:48,690
So they should see that from day one.

1754
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:54,160
They should know big daddy's doing some
squats while he's holding me [inaudible].

1755
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:58,870
Now I'm going to double
down. That being said,

1756
02:01:00,310 --> 02:01:05,170
this is not a time of your life when you
have newborn twins that you're going to

1757
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:09,820
be in the optimal condition. You're not
going to be at your peak performance.

1758
02:01:10,690 --> 02:01:13,750
That's okay, right? That's okay. Hey man,

1759
02:01:14,440 --> 02:01:16,780
you got things going on at you're a dad.

1760
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:19,510
You know you're not new.

1761
02:01:19,570 --> 02:01:24,570
Dad would [inaudible] you're not going
to be setting any of your prs on your,

1762
02:01:25,240 --> 02:01:29,550
on your dead lift. Right? It's
not going to happen. So, but,

1763
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:32,410
but that's not a reason
that you fall apart at all.

1764
02:01:32,770 --> 02:01:35,950
You got to hold the
line as much as you can.

1765
02:01:36,160 --> 02:01:37,910
You've got to balance this situation.

1766
02:01:37,911 --> 02:01:42,050
Now you got a in dig in,

1767
02:01:42,051 --> 02:01:46,100
you gotta be creative with your workout,
with your rest, with your sleep.

1768
02:01:47,570 --> 02:01:50,750
When the opportunity presents itself,
whichever one of those is the priority,

1769
02:01:50,751 --> 02:01:55,550
you've got to go and get it on
and you know,

1770
02:01:56,240 --> 02:01:58,500
it'll happen.
It's not just when you have newborn kids,

1771
02:01:58,501 --> 02:02:00,130
it'll happen with your job.
You'll,

1772
02:02:00,160 --> 02:02:02,750
you'll get some pressure situation at
work and all of a sudden you're going to,

1773
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:05,480
you got to squeeze it in. You know, I had,

1774
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:10,190
I bought houses over time and I would
always buy these houses that were

1775
02:02:10,191 --> 02:02:12,710
unlivable, right. Just on livable,

1776
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:17,090
just brand sack disasters
because they were cheaper.

1777
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:23,350
And then I would go in and do these
like speed remodels alone by yourself,

1778
02:02:25,011 --> 02:02:28,550
by myself. But you know,
for instance, I did a,

1779
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:31,400
I gutted a kitchen in one of my houses,

1780
02:02:31,401 --> 02:02:35,600
gutted the kitchen and redid the
whole kitchen, plumbing, electrical,

1781
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:37,820
new counters, the whole
thing. And I got it.

1782
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:40,670
I didn't get the countertops in
because that was like, you know,

1783
02:02:40,671 --> 02:02:43,850
especially guys come in and do that.
But 72 hours,

1784
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:46,880
72 hours,
nonstop work.

1785
02:02:48,140 --> 02:02:52,850
When I moved into another house I had,
we pulled up the carpet.

1786
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:55,010
I thought there was these nice
hardwood floors under the carpet,

1787
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,890
pulled up water damage.
A third of the,

1788
02:02:58,510 --> 02:03:01,260
a little bit more than a third of the
phone was half the floor is water damage.

1789
02:03:01,261 --> 02:03:06,261
So I had to yank those boards out and
then saying this whole thing and it was a

1790
02:03:06,411 --> 02:03:09,980
nightmare.
It took me 72 hours of no sleep.

1791
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:12,770
I would sleep for 20
minutes waiting for the,

1792
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:17,390
the next layer of varnish to dry
sitting there in the fumes. Right.

1793
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:20,170
But that's what you gotta do
sometimes you got to be, like I said,

1794
02:03:20,171 --> 02:03:22,920
a big project at work,
something that's coming. Uh,

1795
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:26,540
and you got to figure out how to,
what you can fit in,

1796
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:29,270
when you can fit it in and
realize that there's benefit.

1797
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:32,150
There's benefit to that
20 minute little session.

1798
02:03:32,151 --> 02:03:37,130
You just did go do a hundred burpees,
right? Go swing a kettle bell,

1799
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:39,970
just go swipe. I always talking about
the other day we, I got Kettlebell,

1800
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:44,370
I got the, I got the, uh, the
Zombie Bells, right? I got
the Zombie Bells. You know,

1801
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:45,560
I have a garage gym.

1802
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:50,960
The Zombie Bells are in my house
because I'm walking around.

1803
02:03:51,200 --> 02:03:54,500
And sometimes you need to
snatch a kettle bell too, right?

1804
02:03:54,620 --> 02:03:56,920
Sometimes you go snatch a kettle bell.
So,

1805
02:03:56,921 --> 02:04:01,550
so you have that and that builds up
because now you're just boom, you hit out.

1806
02:04:01,580 --> 02:04:05,420
You know, you're not even breaking
into a sweat, just hitting seven,

1807
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:09,140
seven each arm, you know, cannibal snatch.
Maybe it's just, you're just doing that.

1808
02:04:09,290 --> 02:04:13,280
Yeah. And so that's the kind of thing
maybe, you know, with the newborn dad,

1809
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:18,020
you got to have that get to have that
Zombie Bow Sydney House and he just to hit

1810
02:04:18,021 --> 02:04:22,850
some snatches ready just to do some, some,
some sumo dead lift, high pulse. Right.

1811
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:27,600
What's it going to be? Make it
happen. We'll get the pull up bar or,

1812
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:31,400
or a set of rings. Get the rings.
Yeah. You know, something that you can,

1813
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:34,610
rings are great cause then you can do
pull ups, you can do dips. They're very,

1814
02:04:34,611 --> 02:04:39,270
very versatile, very versatile. But
you're going to, the bottom line here is

1815
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:45,210
your life is going to change.
It has changed.

1816
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:48,240
So it doesn't mean, and
you're, you know what,

1817
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:53,130
your life has changed and it just
got better. It just got better.

1818
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:58,820
So what you need to do is you need to
adapt to the new situation and continue to

1819
02:05:01,681 --> 02:05:03,930
drive the excellence.

1820
02:05:04,650 --> 02:05:08,100
But the excellence isn't going
to be served up all at once.

1821
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:11,880
The excellence is going to be served up
in little chunks throughout the day day

1822
02:05:12,390 --> 02:05:16,890
where you can grab it. Yeah. And that's
uh, that's the way it goes. Yeah.

1823
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:21,420
Another tip in, um, I am a
twin. I don't have twins.

1824
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:25,020
Yeah. If you don't know, uh, Echo
Charles is a twin. And by the way,

1825
02:05:25,021 --> 02:05:29,070
you've got some requests
for the echos story.

1826
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:32,520
So maybe next podcast we can wear here.
Echoes Story.

1827
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:35,340
Yeah. Um, yeah, sure.

1828
02:05:37,080 --> 02:05:40,740
I'll give you three minutes and 30 seconds
for it. Good story. I thought I need,

1829
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:45,900
um, but no one, when I
had my daughter and I'm,

1830
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:48,180
I'm pretty into working out,
so you know,

1831
02:05:48,740 --> 02:05:52,950
to not work out with kind of hard or
not have the time, but here's the thing,

1832
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:57,951
I'm really into like the
luxurious situation resting
for a long time and getting

1833
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:59,040
ready mentally ready,

1834
02:05:59,041 --> 02:06:01,560
like taking an hour and a half to get
ready for what I was used to that.

1835
02:06:01,561 --> 02:06:02,580
So that was a big,

1836
02:06:02,730 --> 02:06:07,290
a big change to not have that much rest
and not have to have that much time. So,

1837
02:06:07,380 --> 02:06:10,750
and now you're doing Jocko podcasts,
you get even less as less rest. Well,

1838
02:06:10,770 --> 02:06:12,920
she's three now, so it's different. Um,

1839
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:17,670
but a thing that helps on
top of everything you said,

1840
02:06:17,671 --> 02:06:20,990
which is in my opinion,
absolutely correct, 100%, um,

1841
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:26,670
to add to it is work with your wife
or husband if you're a girl, you know,

1842
02:06:26,671 --> 02:06:31,230
and your, and you guys have kind of
communicate with them, tell them that,

1843
02:06:31,231 --> 02:06:33,570
you know,
working out in staying in shape is,

1844
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:38,600
is important to me or whatever or in a
good way to put it is getting unhealthy

1845
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:46,410
at this time with our new kids is
means a lot, you know, if I do that,

1846
02:06:46,411 --> 02:06:49,530
like it means a lot to stay
healthy. Um, so you know,

1847
02:06:49,531 --> 02:06:52,620
if you communicate that will help as well
because you can work with each other.

1848
02:06:52,621 --> 02:06:55,330
You know, how like, you know,
when you have a new kids, um,

1849
02:06:55,710 --> 02:06:59,400
it's kind of like one guy can, you know,
capitalize on a rest time, you know,

1850
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,560
and then you know,
the other guy will kind of stand,

1851
02:07:01,561 --> 02:07:04,610
watch with the kids and the other,
the other person can, can get rest.

1852
02:07:04,611 --> 02:07:07,470
So if you communicate,
that'll help your situation so much.

1853
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:13,260
So I am guilty here of unintentional
communications because if I,

1854
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,390
you know what, when, when, when my
wife and I, when our kids were young,

1855
02:07:23,440 --> 02:07:26,740
if I didn't work out,

1856
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:32,830
and quite honestly if I didn't train
Jujitsu, I am guilty. I'm, yeah,

1857
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:36,070
I was, I, I wouldn't
recognize, but it just would

1858
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:39,610
really like frustrate me. Right. And
so eventually she said, you know what,

1859
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:43,810
just get your stupid ass
outta here and go train. Yeah.

1860
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:48,350
Because I'd rather just have you go, and
that's when, that's when I, you know, we,

1861
02:07:48,351 --> 02:07:50,410
I'd show up at the gym at
eight o'clock at night,

1862
02:07:50,411 --> 02:07:53,530
like Dean would be done teaching class
and I'd come in there and we trained for

1863
02:07:53,531 --> 02:07:57,640
38 minutes, you know, just go in
there, get it on and come home.

1864
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:02,500
So, you know, try not to do
that where you're a jerk. Right.

1865
02:08:02,530 --> 02:08:06,280
But there's something, I mean I talk
about this all the time, that there is,

1866
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:10,990
there is a mind body connection
that is undeniable. Yeah. For sure.

1867
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:16,020
And if you don't find a place to get
that aggression out and get that the

1868
02:08:16,961 --> 02:08:20,150
endorphins flowing and get the,
the,

1869
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:22,990
the good feeling that you
get from physical activity,

1870
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:27,970
then you're going to turn you and turn a
little bit nasty. That's not good. Yeah.

1871
02:08:27,980 --> 02:08:29,110
And of course that,

1872
02:08:29,111 --> 02:08:32,530
that I bet you a lot of relationships
really suffer from that and people don't

1873
02:08:32,531 --> 02:08:37,300
recognize it. I think so do I think in my
experience from talking to people, okay,

1874
02:08:37,440 --> 02:08:39,940
so, okay, but so that
element, that element of,

1875
02:08:39,941 --> 02:08:43,030
of exercising and it being interrupted
by a new kids or something like that,

1876
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,980
that'll vary from person to person.
Right.

1877
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:48,960
So you being all nuts because
you can't train, you know,

1878
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:52,550
the next guy might not be that nuts.
They might affect him maybe this much,

1879
02:08:52,620 --> 02:08:53,500
it would be this much,
you know,

1880
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:57,730
it's different m and a that
goes along with what I said,

1881
02:08:57,731 --> 02:09:01,700
like communicating,
actively telling him

1882
02:09:03,210 --> 02:09:07,180
like, you know, doing what
you did but communicate.

1883
02:09:07,420 --> 02:09:11,710
And at the same time, if you're aware
of it, which it can be the hard part,

1884
02:09:11,711 --> 02:09:15,220
if you're aware that you're just
not as happy, just just know that.

1885
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:18,900
So really kind of check yourself if you
feel yourself losing your temporary, I'm,

1886
02:09:18,901 --> 02:09:22,330
I'm, you know, I'm unhappy because
I'm sacrificing a few training days.

1887
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:26,920
You're right. The red flag of
that's, that's a great point.

1888
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:30,430
The red flag of,
Hey,

1889
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:33,970
it sucks having kids. Yes.
You have the red flag.

1890
02:09:33,971 --> 02:09:37,450
The reason you're feeling that is because
it's this part of that reasons because

1891
02:09:37,451 --> 02:09:39,400
it's disrupting your physical activity.

1892
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:43,350
So recognize that and then
do something about it. Yeah.

1893
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:47,020
Communicate with your spouse,
you know, set up a plan.

1894
02:09:47,590 --> 02:09:51,190
Get a pull up bar, get a
kettle bell in the house. Yeah.

1895
02:09:51,370 --> 02:09:55,990
Do and make it happen. Yeah. And the,
I think that's a good point. Yeah.

1896
02:09:56,010 --> 02:10:00,340
It's not going to be as luxurious as you
know. You're not going to be optimum.

1897
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:04,230
It's not a time. And a lot of them will
with me. That bothered me. You know, not,

1898
02:10:04,660 --> 02:10:07,630
it didn't, I didn't really
pay much of a price, you know,

1899
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:10,150
as far as it bothering me
when something bothers me,

1900
02:10:10,151 --> 02:10:13,150
I don't like lose my temper typically,
but I did feel that I'd be like,

1901
02:10:13,180 --> 02:10:13,870
oh my gosh,

1902
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:16,390
I don't have that much time or I don't
have the energy because they didn't get

1903
02:10:16,391 --> 02:10:18,430
enough sleep and it was kind of annoying.
But

1904
02:10:19,930 --> 02:10:24,160
at the same time I did adapt and
I got real good at um, you know,

1905
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:27,360
like the exercise like Jim Gymnast can
do it like on a pommel horse or something

1906
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:28,540
or I'd go on the ground,

1907
02:10:28,541 --> 02:10:32,470
I'd sit with my legs and feet out in
front and you can live, he'll sit. Yeah.

1908
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:36,500
Yeah man, I got real good at
doing that. But nonetheless,

1909
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:42,360
the doctor, the Jujitsu
thing, um, two things. Yeah.

1910
02:10:42,380 --> 02:10:43,213
Communicate,

1911
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:46,280
understand when you're starting to get
a little irritated because he didn't,

1912
02:10:46,370 --> 02:10:50,870
didn't train, understand that
and then handle it accordingly.

1913
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:54,380
That's a, on the flip side,
if you have to recognize,

1914
02:10:54,620 --> 02:10:58,640
okay this is a typical situation
where now you have kids,

1915
02:10:58,730 --> 02:11:02,920
yet you still want to go train Jujitsu,
but your wife is like how,

1916
02:11:02,940 --> 02:11:07,850
how can you reconcile going to
train with your buddies? You know,

1917
02:11:07,851 --> 02:11:11,570
cause a lot of times the girlfriend or
the wife will think that that's just some,

1918
02:11:11,630 --> 02:11:13,670
some fun and games and you know,

1919
02:11:13,671 --> 02:11:16,960
in their mind they think it's another
relationship you basically have going on

1920
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:20,140
but they don't understand the
important of Gel. The bottom,

1921
02:11:20,141 --> 02:11:22,460
the Jujitsu potentially.
Yes. And it's the spectrum.

1922
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:26,510
So it's important to to,
like I said,

1923
02:11:26,511 --> 02:11:30,800
communicate and let them, let them
know that it's not that, you know,

1924
02:11:30,801 --> 02:11:32,840
and they don't always get it.
I understand that.

1925
02:11:32,841 --> 02:11:37,841
But if you just can communicate and
effectively get the message that it is an

1926
02:11:38,421 --> 02:11:42,920
important thing in life,
hey listen Darlin what's important to you?

1927
02:11:43,210 --> 02:11:46,070
What's it you know, cause you never
know what it is. Whether it's running,

1928
02:11:46,100 --> 02:11:47,900
whether it's their biking
or whether it's there,

1929
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:51,650
anything date night with their
girls or whatever the case may be.

1930
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:55,010
That's what you've got. This is what
I've got. I've got these two things.

1931
02:11:55,050 --> 02:11:57,840
You have got to work out. I got
to train some Jujitsu. Yeah.

1932
02:11:58,030 --> 02:12:00,710
You know that's when I got to do.
But beef be fair though.

1933
02:12:00,711 --> 02:12:03,800
Like if you're going seven days a week
before the kids and you still want to go

1934
02:12:03,801 --> 02:12:06,380
seven days a week, three hours
a day, understand that. Okay,

1935
02:12:06,381 --> 02:12:08,850
you got kids not going to
bring it down to like six.

1936
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:14,660
I was really bad.
Yeah I can see that.

1937
02:12:15,230 --> 02:12:17,900
But it's in a way it's not fair,
you know,

1938
02:12:17,901 --> 02:12:22,901
like not only to your wife but to
the fact that you have kids now.

1939
02:12:24,170 --> 02:12:27,560
You know there's only so
much Jocko Kingo around.

1940
02:12:27,590 --> 02:12:29,720
Yeah I don't,

1941
02:12:30,650 --> 02:12:32,720
I'm questioning whether I should
tell this but I'm going to.

1942
02:12:33,440 --> 02:12:35,750
So there was times where
I would come home from,

1943
02:12:35,751 --> 02:12:40,250
work in the seal teams work
until seven o'clock at night,

1944
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:44,300
come home from work,
walk through the door,

1945
02:12:44,330 --> 02:12:48,500
drop my work bag and pick up my gym bag.

1946
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:54,130
My wife's there with three young
kids and she would be looking at me

1947
02:12:56,450 --> 02:13:01,430
with the expression of
are you freaking serious?

1948
02:13:02,290 --> 02:13:05,900
Cause you know, I'm only home
for, let's call it four days,

1949
02:13:05,901 --> 02:13:07,760
then I'm going on another trip
and I'm home for three days.

1950
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:11,900
So those four days she's thinking, cool,
he's home for four days, family time.

1951
02:13:12,080 --> 02:13:16,880
I'm thinking cool home for
four days and nap time. And,

1952
02:13:18,100 --> 02:13:19,070
but again,

1953
02:13:19,071 --> 02:13:24,071
what she realized was that
if she was to stop me,

1954
02:13:26,180 --> 02:13:29,720
she's got a jerk in the
house. Now, not, not even,

1955
02:13:30,770 --> 02:13:33,150
I mean just, just, it just is.
It's just the reality of it.

1956
02:13:33,490 --> 02:13:37,890
I just would be really frustrated with
the situation and all I want to do is

1957
02:13:37,891 --> 02:13:42,210
just go train because it's part of who
I am and I want to get on the mat and I

1958
02:13:42,211 --> 02:13:45,330
want to get better and I want
to, it's very selfish, right?

1959
02:13:45,331 --> 02:13:48,390
I mean all of the reasons are
selfish, but that be that, that,

1960
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:51,143
but

1961
02:13:52,710 --> 02:13:57,450
the reality is that's,
that's me.

1962
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:01,410
That's me. Yeah, that's me team.

1963
02:14:01,411 --> 02:14:05,790
And you can't change your knee. Yeah,
will, we'll, of course, of course.

1964
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:07,910
It's still gonna be you.
But you know,

1965
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:11,850
this is going to sound real obvious and
Cliche, but the whole compromise thing,

1966
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:16,530
when you guys have a bunch of kids,
you got a compromise and don't be like,

1967
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:20,460
hey everyone else in the whole
group. By the way, the kids,

1968
02:14:20,461 --> 02:14:24,000
even though you know your wife,
everyone in the whole group,

1969
02:14:24,001 --> 02:14:27,120
you guys compromise a factor
of eight out of 10. Me,

1970
02:14:27,121 --> 02:14:30,870
I'm just going to compromise the factor
of 0.5 cause I'm still gonna go to Jiu

1971
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:33,890
Jitsu every single day for as
long as I've done it. You know,

1972
02:14:33,891 --> 02:14:38,040
do all the things that you've done before.
You have kids, you can't do that. Yeah,

1973
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:41,790
I don't think you can do that.
Yeah, no, you shouldn't do that.

1974
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:46,710
But I am saying yeah and
I did. Yeah. And and sure.

1975
02:14:46,730 --> 02:14:49,770
A lot of it because he's not aware.
A lot of time you, you're not saying,

1976
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:52,500
you know what? I know I'm being a
Dick Right now and you know what?

1977
02:14:52,530 --> 02:14:54,200
I'm okay with being a Dick Right now.
You know,

1978
02:14:54,230 --> 02:14:57,090
and then I share a fault for not
letting me train or whatever. Yeah.

1979
02:14:57,570 --> 02:14:59,430
I guess I might not have been the best,

1980
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:06,120
the best husband and let scenario
live and learn and, and it's, it's,

1981
02:15:06,810 --> 02:15:11,610
I don't want to say it's good, but when
you have new kids and especially twins,

1982
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:13,340
twins,

1983
02:15:13,340 --> 02:15:18,340
it does allow you to kind of
reconcile what's important.

1984
02:15:18,720 --> 02:15:18,991
You know,

1985
02:15:18,991 --> 02:15:23,220
like let's say every Tuesday you went to
Taco Tuesday or something like that and

1986
02:15:23,221 --> 02:15:27,180
drank every Tuesday right before kids,
now you've got twins. I'm like, man,

1987
02:15:27,181 --> 02:15:30,420
I'm really how you get
to honestly ask yourself,

1988
02:15:30,421 --> 02:15:32,700
is that kind of stuff important now?
No.

1989
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:35,310
Taco Tuesday's not important
compared to kids. Yeah. No,

1990
02:15:35,340 --> 02:15:38,040
but you could say time with my friends
is important and all this other stuff,

1991
02:15:38,041 --> 02:15:39,720
but the drinking and it just all little,

1992
02:15:39,721 --> 02:15:43,470
little detailed things that
you can easily go without.

1993
02:15:43,590 --> 02:15:45,840
And in a lot of cases do better without,

1994
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:48,300
but their vices or whatever when you can,

1995
02:15:48,360 --> 02:15:53,360
when you have twins or new
kids or just kids in general,

1996
02:15:53,880 --> 02:15:57,290
you do get that opportunity to reconcile
what's more important. Yeah. You,

1997
02:15:57,350 --> 02:16:00,930
you get to prioritize and execute.
I'm sure for sure.

1998
02:16:02,330 --> 02:16:06,660
All right. We haven't, congratulations
twins. It's a big deal. Yeah. No doubt.

1999
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:09,790
I hope their hope,
the names are echo in jeans.

2000
02:16:10,940 --> 02:16:12,430
I mean what happened

2001
02:16:15,390 --> 02:16:16,890
in the hall.
Yeah.

2002
02:16:19,650 --> 02:16:24,650
Jocko knowledge is a powerful
tool to become knowledgeable.

2003
02:16:25,170 --> 02:16:29,980
You must ask good questions.
You have advice for asking

2004
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:34,930
good questions. Yeah, I mean,

2005
02:16:36,550 --> 02:16:40,720
knowledge is a powerful tool for sure.

2006
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:45,970
A, I mean it's, it's the
master of tools, right?

2007
02:16:46,180 --> 02:16:48,850
It's where all your tools come from.

2008
02:16:49,910 --> 02:16:50,660
Okay.

2009
02:16:50,660 --> 02:16:54,470
Because without knowledge there's nothing,
and you know,

2010
02:16:55,460 --> 02:17:00,260
you take that one step further
and really knowledge is,

2011
02:17:00,890 --> 02:17:03,320
it's a weapon.
It's the ultimate weapon

2012
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:06,980
in it trumps all other weapons,
right?

2013
02:17:06,981 --> 02:17:10,670
Fought is what wins the mind is what wins.

2014
02:17:10,671 --> 02:17:12,770
The knowledge is what wins.

2015
02:17:14,540 --> 02:17:15,770
And you absolutely,

2016
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:17,733
you,

2017
02:17:18,640 --> 02:17:23,260
you, you gain knowledge by
asking questions. Right?

2018
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:27,280
So my advice for asking
questions is pretty simple.

2019
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:32,410
Question everything.
Don't,

2020
02:17:33,490 --> 02:17:37,060
don't just accept anything as truth.

2021
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,300
Question it all question everything.

2022
02:17:40,420 --> 02:17:45,220
I tell my kids when they go to school
to sit in the front of the classroom and

2023
02:17:45,221 --> 02:17:49,000
when they, when they, when they don't
understand something that's second,

2024
02:17:49,001 --> 02:17:53,260
they don't understand something, just
put your hand right up in there and say,

2025
02:17:54,250 --> 02:17:56,500
I don't understand that. I understand
that part. Can you go over that again?

2026
02:17:59,650 --> 02:18:03,340
And that's how you need to be in life.
That's how I try to be.

2027
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:08,710
Well, you don't understand a word.
Break out a dictionary and look it up.

2028
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:10,600
Okay?

2029
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:12,160
If you don't understand the concept,

2030
02:18:12,200 --> 02:18:16,580
break down the concept until
you do understand it. Vina,

2031
02:18:16,581 --> 02:18:20,150
know how something works. Dig into
it until you do know how it works.

2032
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:24,200
Ask every question that comes to mind.

2033
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:29,880
And I'm not saying that you
have to blurt out why, why, why,

2034
02:18:29,881 --> 02:18:33,420
why this like a five year
old and everything you see.

2035
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,400
But yes,

2036
02:18:35,490 --> 02:18:38,940
ask those questions and
learn and most importantly,

2037
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:45,500
question yourself.
Question yourself every day.

2038
02:18:45,590 --> 02:18:49,670
Ask Yourself,
Oh,

2039
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:51,273
who am I?

2040
02:18:52,540 --> 02:18:53,020
Yeah.

2041
02:18:53,020 --> 02:18:55,960
What have I learned?
What have I created?

2042
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:00,430
What forward progress have I made?

2043
02:19:02,730 --> 02:19:03,960
Who have I helped?

2044
02:19:05,960 --> 02:19:06,793
Yeah.

2045
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:12,110
What am I doing to improve
myself today to get better,

2046
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:15,330
faster, stronger, healthier, smarter?

2047
02:19:19,590 --> 02:19:21,090
Ask Yourself,

2048
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:25,940
is this what I want to be?

2049
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:31,030
This is this all I've got this,

2050
02:19:32,391 --> 02:19:34,970
this,
everything I can give.

2051
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:38,410
Is this

2052
02:19:40,510 --> 02:19:42,340
going to be my life

2053
02:19:47,150 --> 02:19:50,480
and do I except that

2054
02:19:56,790 --> 02:20:00,600
you got to ask yourself those questions,
those hard questions,

2055
02:20:00,690 --> 02:20:02,840
and you've got to answer getting,

2056
02:20:02,850 --> 02:20:07,850
answer them truthfully and you
got to realize that all of us,

2057
02:20:08,791 --> 02:20:10,350
all of us,

2058
02:20:11,520 --> 02:20:12,050
okay,

2059
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:14,720
can do better.
We can be better.

2060
02:20:18,470 --> 02:20:20,630
You just got to take that first step

2061
02:20:22,470 --> 02:20:27,420
and that first step is when you
begin to ask those questions.

2062
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:32,693
Yeah.

2063
02:20:33,550 --> 02:20:37,240
So advice on asking questions,

2064
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:39,340
ask the hard questions

2065
02:20:40,870 --> 02:20:43,540
and ask the hard questions of yourself.

2066
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:49,690
Ain't in the answers to those questions

2067
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:53,540
is where you find that path,

2068
02:20:56,290 --> 02:21:00,430
the path to progress
and the path to freedom

2069
02:21:04,330 --> 02:21:05,410
inside your mind.

2070
02:21:10,890 --> 02:21:15,590
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2071
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:21,610
Thanks to all the troopers out
there for tuning in, listening, uh,

2072

with my strange little thoughts.

2073
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:27,093
Appreciate it.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts
with me on the interweb connecting.

connected with me and giving me feedback,
