1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,600
You have to be very careful with praise.
Oh yeah.

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,750
Because in the example that I give in
the corner of MMA fights is if you tell a

3
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:11,670
guy, hey, good job. You know you're
well, you won that last round.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,990
Keep just keep doing what you're doing.
He's going to back off.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,510
He's going to back off. And guess
what the other corners telling him,

6
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,110
you lost that round. You need to step
it up. You need to get aggressive.

7
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,360
And that's what they're gonna do.
They're gonna get out there.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,860
Because I'll tell you,
most people in an MMA fight,

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,870
MMA fight is a, it's like wrestling.
It's a very intense cardio activity.

10
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:37,070
You're good. Everybody's going to be
tired, beat just about everybody knew,

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,620
obviously. So when you get two guys,
well let me, let me rephrase that.

12
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:43,560
When you get two guys that are evenly
matched and are going at it hard,

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,100
they're both going to be tired. And so
they're gonna want a little bit of a rest.

14
00:00:47,101 --> 00:00:51,120
So can you give them that opportunity to
back off the throttle just a little bit.

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,670
Subconsciously they're going to do it
because they think they're doing good.

16
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:58,500
They think that one that last round, so
you can see that all the time. You see,

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,300
I mean it happened, it happened with
Rhonda, you know, they're saying, hey,

18
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:07,500
good job, good job. You're looking
good and she's getting crushed.

19
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,680
I mean, that's kind of a bad example. But
anyways, you gotta be careful of that.

20
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:16,200
And I've told this story before,

21
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:19,720
but when my tasking was going
through training and uh,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,580
we will doing CQC, so close
quarters, combat drills,

23
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:26,850
we're going in a kill house
over and over and you know,

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,860
we broke for lunch or something.

25
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:33,630
We come back from lunch and the guy
that is Kadri, they're like, hey,

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,040
you guys are kicking ass. This is great.
Keep it up. You guys are two best task.

27
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:40,770
You know, we've seen out here,
you guys are crushing it.

28
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,610
And literally the next run guys go in
the house, they screw everything up,

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,880
they miss targets, just a disaster.
And I talked to the contrary. I'm like,

30
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:51,690
don't ever tell my guys again that
they're the best guys in the world. Don't.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,210
Don't tell them that.
You can tell them good job,

32
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:58,050
but don't be telling them they're
the best people in the world.

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,770
Just doesn't work. And so that's
kind of what happened. You know here.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,570
Now the thing is,

35
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:06,390
this doesn't mean that you can never
give anybody credit or never give anyone

36
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,690
praise, because you absolutely have
to do that. But what you have to do,

37
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,691
you have to proactively counter act the
mental lapse and intensity that's about

38
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,890
to take place because you just
compliment them. So how do you do that?

39
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,520
So let's say you're on the
lacrosse field or the soccer field,

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,340
you bring the boys in. You say, look
guys, good half good. First half.

41
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,060
You took it to them. You showed
them that we can hang with them.

42
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,240
You played him even. That's
fine. Here's the problem.

43
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,730
Even isn't good enough.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,690
We need to get out there and play harder.

45
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,740
We need to step it up. I actually
want you guys to play like murderers.

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,230
That's what I want you to do.
I want you to win every loose ball.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,060
I want you to make every tackle.

48
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,550
I want you to get your head on
every ball that's in the air.

49
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,730
You stick to them on defense. I don't
even want them to be able to breathe.

50
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,490
I want you to work them into the ground.
I want pressure, pressure, upfront,

51
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:10,040
pressure in the midfield
and pressure on d.

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,660
You make them fight for every inch,
every bell and every breath.

53
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,690
I want you to go out there
and take their souls.

54
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,930
So you got to counter that. You know,
you've got to counter the good job thing.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,330
So in MMA it's the same
thing. You know, hey,

56
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,120
good around who was a close round
but a good round. But listen,

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,220
you can't let up right now. You need to
step it up. He knows he has to step it up.

58
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:37,010
I'm telling you, he knows he's got to
step it up. And if you come out week,

59
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:40,130
he's going to get the upper hand
right away. You need to put him away.

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,560
You need to go out there and crush him,
crush his soul,

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,880
turn it on and put this guy away.

62
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,100
I want you to kill him.
So that's what you need to do with that.

63
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:59,460
Now for tactical training,
same thing, cause you know,

64
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,970
I know this police officer's and Swat
teams and t and guys that are in the

65
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:03,451
military,

66
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,810
you're doing tactical training all the
time and you're going to see that as the

67
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:10,080
team comes together, they're going
to start to do good. But like I said,

68
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:11,400
if you give them too much,

69
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:12,720
okay,

70
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,100
they're going to slack,
right?

71
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:18,570
So you know when you're running your
tactical training, you for your guys,

72
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:21,750
you say, look, hey guys, I see
some good progress out there.

73
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:22,860
We're making some good runs.

74
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,010
But let me tell you it's not
good enough for it right now.

75
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,043
Okay?

76
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,570
This is the deal. The enemy can rely on
luck. We can't, we rely on our training.

77
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,970
We trained to be prepared for
anything that the enemy throws at us.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,110
So we're going to work as hard as
we can and be as perfect as we can.

79
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,750
So we are ready for the
worst case scenario.

80
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,930
So get jacked up for
another run right now.

81
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,710
And I want you to go in there like a
band of bloodthirsty viking shock troops,

82
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,430
all our damn berserker
rage and crush this.

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,360
So you want to bring that
kind of calendar right?

84
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,290
And then in combat again,

85
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:13,090
and I just was talking to some guys
yesterday and it's the same thing where

86
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:18,091
complacency is the worst thing that can
happen with your team when you're in a

87
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:21,430
combat scenario. So when you're in
combat, you know it's look, hey guys,

88
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,220
we're running some good operations,
right?

89
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,010
We got the upper hand and that's good,

90
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,080
but it's not good enough.

91
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:35,081
We cannot be complacent and we can't
take our foot off the enemy's throat.

92
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,170
We are going to be relentless.

93
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:43,190
We are not going to give
him the chance to regroup.

94
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:48,080
He will not get the chance to recover.
There will be no downtime for the enemy.

95
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:48,943
And I'll tell you what,

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,100
I don't even want the enemy to
have a chance to bury their dead.

97
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,540
We are not going to stop until there was
left to pursue and no one left to bury.

98
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,390
So sharpen up your knives, load up your
magazines, because we got work to do.

99
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,970
So again, we got to counter, you know,

100
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,300
the compliments in balance.

101
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,350
Essentially what I'm doing in
each one of those situations,

102
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:23,590
I'm balancing the positive affirmations
of what is happening with some new goals

103
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,370
and new objectives that will ensure
that there will be no slack. No.
