00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,640
This is Jocko podcast number
51 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,940
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,683
Forgotten.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,870
The Korean War is often referred to as
the forgotten war and it's sandwiched

5
00:00:26,611 --> 00:00:28,500
between deep,

6
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:32,550
massive world war two and
then on the other side,

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,100
the highly controversial and also
highly televised and therefore highly

8
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:39,750
remembered Vietnam War.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,800
So I guess in that middle of that,

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,150
the Korean War somehow gets lost
and I guess somehow gets forgotten.

11
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,910
No,
obviously we should never forget.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,470
The war in Korea was brutal.

13
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:06,450
And in many ways when you
look at the Korean War,

14
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:09,690
you see the worst parts of these,
all other wars,

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,920
you had the trenches of world war one,

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,590
you had the bitter cold of the
eastern front. In World War II,

17
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,420
you have the landmines of the Vietnam War.

18
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,180
And for the nearly 2 million that served
in Korea and the more than 100,000 that

19
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:35,004
were wounded,

20
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,770
we should never forget.
And we must never forget.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,920
And for the 36,516
Americans that were killed.

22
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,250
We must always remember

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,240
always and remember that
for those that died,

24
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,970
there is nothing else.
There's nothing else.

25
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,620
They gave everything.

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,830
Everything they gave for a few meters
in between trenches are for hill or for

27
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,940
their brothers in arms.
That's what war does.

28
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,160
That gives everything to som

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,370
and it takes everything from others.

30
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,843
Okay.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Tert tonight we begin to take a look at
the Korean War through the eyes of James

32
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,353
Brady,

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,020
United States Marine Corps
in his book the coldest war.

34
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,443
Yeah.

35
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,440
What job are you looking for?

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,460
I knew the answer and snapped

37
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,920
it back. Rifle platoon leader, sir.

38
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,340
The major said that I was a hard charger,

39
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,870
that they needed hard chargers in the
basic school in Virginia where they

40
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,740
trained marine lieutenants, they ask
you every few hours that same question.

41
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,750
Then they push a form at you to write down
your four first three choices of duty.

42
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,830
There are several schools of
thought about this one held.

43
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:25,090
You should tell the truth.

44
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:30,460
Those who subscribe to this odd notion
put down communications or tanks or

45
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,330
mountain training.

46
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,410
Anything that might delay assignment
to a replacement draft and the war.

47
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,200
Another advise diplomacy,

48
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,380
a first choice of rifle platoon
leader to show your spirit.

49
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,930
Then what you really hope for
logistics or motor transport.

50
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,570
A third school felt you should lie.

51
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:54,571
Brazenly indicating ferocious demand
for a rifle platoon on grounds that this

52
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,960
might impress people and get
you made a general's aide.

53
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,370
Mac Allen achieved something of a name
at basic school by stipulating quite

54
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,450
honestly, each time. Rifle platoon
leader, rifle platoon leader,

55
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,720
rifle platoon leader.
I didn't worry about it much,

56
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
not out of fatalism,

57
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:19,540
but simply because I believe the marine
corps discarded all such forms without

58
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,910
reading.
And it didn't matter much what you wrote

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,900
this close to the line. I
was too embarrassed to give
any answer, but the one,

60
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,680
the major obviously wanted to
hear splendid, said the major,

61
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,020
we have an opening for a hard charger.

62
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:38,770
Second Battalion Colonel Gregory's
battalion. They want, yeah.
