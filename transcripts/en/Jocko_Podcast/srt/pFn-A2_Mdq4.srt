1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,700
This is Jocko podcast number
one 24 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,250
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
bullets punched through the chopper
as Nev and I jumped out together.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,050
We ran over to the farthest wounded guy,
grabbed him,

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,450
ran back and tossed him into the bird.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,390
We picked up a second wounded in action
the same way and then a third amazingly,

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,790
without becoming casualties ourselves,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
but by the time everyone was
loaded onto the helicopter,

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,490
there was no room inside for me.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,890
I stood on the skids and put on my helmet
so I could tell the pilot to take off,

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,240
but I found I couldn't talk.
I was so dried out.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,470
My tongue had welded itself to the
roof of my mouth out of pure fear.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,200
I had to open my canteen and drink
some water before I could even gasp.

14
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,540
Let's get this mother out of here.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,440
We took the wounded back to base and
returned to the fight without anything

16
00:01:07,481 --> 00:01:09,290
holding him up.
Now I couldn't out.

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,690
Couldn't figure out why Torpy didn't
do something about getting his men

18
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:16,150
consolidated.
Outside of that Patty,

19
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,510
he still kept saying he was pinned
down. Finally, I lost my temper.

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,550
I really chewed his ass over the radio
demanding he get cracking and get those

21
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:28,410
men out of that Patty.
Now

22
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:34,880
apparently the next thing he
did was put down the radio,

23
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,460
stand straight up and begin running from
man to man to get them to move back.

24
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,650
He got mowed down right away
and died a short time later.

25
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Maybe I hadn't learned a damn thing at
my con or from Dennis Foley's near miss

26
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:02,040
in that minefield.
I hadn't asked to stand up.

27
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,070
He didn't need to in order
to extricate himself,

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,380
but it hadn't occurred
to me that he would.

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,530
I had been playing the game as
if we tend at nap a lot. Natural,

30
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,450
more seasoned leader was in charge.

31
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,340
It was due to the force of my word as
his commander that this inexperienced

32
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:26,040
young lieutenant was sent to his death

33
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,300
like Jim Gardeners.

34
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:35,170
Torpys def was a big guilt thing for
me and has remained so all my life

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,520
and that he is an excerpt

36
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,100
from the book about face,
which is by Colonel David Hackworth.

37
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,760
A book that we covered on this podcast.
In fact,

38
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:59,761
it was the first book we covered on this
podcast and there a reason for that.

39
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:07,020
The book about face was and is my
favorite book and when I was deployed to

40
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:14,380
Ramadi in 2006 I read it and
reread it every chance I got.

41
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,340
Now the book is about war,

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,900
but I have always found it to be a book
about leadership and in my opinion,

43
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:29,750
the best book I have ever
read about leadership.

44
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,950
David Hackworth,
who was born and raised in California,

45
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,570
lied about his age and joined the
Merchant Marines and served in the South

46
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,920
Pacific and the end of World War II.

47
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,400
And then he joined the army where he
rose through the ranks serving in the

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,030
Korean War and the Vietnam War.
Battlefield commissioned

49
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,580
no verse career in combat. He was awarded
two Distinguished Service Crosses,

50
00:03:56,581 --> 00:04:01,240
eight silver stars, three legions of
Merit, distinguished flying cross,

51
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:02,920
okay.

52
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,870
An eight purple hearts
and

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,640
in the end he became an outspoken opponent
of how we were fighting the war in

54
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:19,510
Vietnam and that cost him
his career in the army.

55
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,650
He went on to write these books and
was able to pass on the lessons that he

56
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:31,300
learned through these books about face,
which as I said,

57
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,090
we covered on podcast number two.

58
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:35,740
He also wrote a book called
steal my soldier's heart,

59
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,070
which is covered on podcast 28

60
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,470
and unfortunately he died.

61
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah,

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,020
on May 4th,

63
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,630
2005 before I ever got
the chance to meet him,

64
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,100
but a few months ago someone
reached out to me on social media,

65
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,260
someone by the name of Jay Mooka Yama.

66
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,050
Yeah,

67
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,630
and he was a listener to the
podcast and he, he thought,

68
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:11,190
I'm just might be interested in
talking to his father, James Mooky Amo.

69
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,260
The name looked pretty familiar.

70
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:20,261
I thought I recognized it and I quickly
realized that this was the full name of

71
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:25,250
one of the men that appeared in both
books about face and steal my soldier's

72
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,084
heart.

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,680
Okay.

74
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,750
The man Colonel Hackworth
simply called milk

75
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,540
did.
I replied to Jay and said,

76
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:39,541
I would be absolutely honored to be
introduced to his father who was in fact

77
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,390
Major General James and Mooka Yama,

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,400
a retired army officer that had served
as a company commander in Vietnam working

79
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:52,330
directly for Colonel Hackworth.

80
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:57,190
And after some logistical coordination,

81
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,370
it is my absolute honor to welcome
General James Mooky Yama to the podcast.

82
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,290
Sir,
this is an absolute honor.

83
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,970
Well, Jocko, it,

84
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,060
it is the same on this side and I've
listened to some of your podcasts,

85
00:06:16,781 --> 00:06:18,390
especially the one on steel,

86
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:22,380
my soldiers hearts and I
couldn't stop listening to it.

87
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,420
And then I realized, I looked at my
watch and I said, this is over two hours.

88
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:28,700
They're ready.
Uh,

89
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,010
just because of the way you picked out
the really important things that hack,

90
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,820
hack growth. In fact, I forgot
a lot of things until you,

91
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,880
you read verbatim some of
the things that he said and,

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,680
and he lived what he wrote.
I might add.

93
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,230
He led by example.

94
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,920
Yeah. Well, I definitely have taken a
ton of lessons from him over the years.

95
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,890
And that's why it's just amazing
to be sitting here with you.

96
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,050
And let's talk about you though.

97
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:06,130
Let's talk about how you ended up in the
army and where you came from and what

98
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:10,150
your background was. You know what,
why don't you take us back to Chicago?

99
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:15,120
Sure. I was born in waste and
the inner city of Chicago,

100
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:19,980
a neighborhood called Logan Square.
Uh, primarily Polish, German,

101
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,840
Italian. We were the only minority
family in that neighborhood.

102
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,180
We went to a grammar school of 900.

103
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:30,150
My brother and I were the only minorities.

104
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,940
So I grew up, I grew up basically in a
predominantly white, white environment.

105
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,980
Uh, but I never felt like
I was different really.

106
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,020
Cause everybody treated me fine.
It was,

107
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:47,610
it was a time in life in the inner
city where everybody knew each other.

108
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,200
You know, in our neighborhood are blocked.
We didn't lock our doors. Um, you know,

109
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,920
everybody knew a, that's
a time when, you know,

110
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,160
most mothers stayed at home
and they were the police of,

111
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:04,890
of the block. So if anybody would
come by there was out of order, uh,

112
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,840
you know, they would take care of
it. But we, uh, we were, I'd say,

113
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:13,920
lower middle class economically.
Uh, we never owned a home.

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,440
We always lived in an apartment building.
Um,

115
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,080
my father was an immigrant
from Japan. Um, my mother was,

116
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:26,610
her family was from Japan,
but she was actually born in Madison,

117
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:30,990
Wisconsin. And so my grandparents
live with us, you know,

118
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:34,890
we all three generations
in the same apartment. Uh,

119
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,970
and I never felt poor. I, you know,

120
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:42,360
because we had a strong family.
Uh,

121
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:46,860
our church was only three blocks
away from our apartment building.

122
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,890
Every Sunday we put on our Sunday best
clothes and we would walk as a family to

123
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,124
church.

124
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,680
No, it's interesting you, you,

125
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:59,150
you said dad had immigrated from Japan
and your mom was born in Wisconsin. Yeah.

126
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,740
Was your mom not your mom get put in
the internment camps with her family and

127
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,583
during World War II?

128
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,530
No. No, no. Here, here's the thing.

129
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,990
My father came to the states in 1918.
In fact,

130
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,850
that was kind of a
funny thing. He was, uh,

131
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,470
he was going to sign up for World War
One, you know, which was still going on,

132
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:23,360
but then it ended, so he couldn't,
he couldn't sign up. And, uh,

133
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,780
and then when World War Two
hit, he was too old, you know,

134
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:30,650
and plus he was a Japanese. He, I
don't know if you know this or not,

135
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:33,170
Japanese could not become citizens,

136
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,320
naturalized citizens of the
United States until 1952.

137
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,920
And so, uh, so he was, uh, you know,

138
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,740
he was still a Japanese citizen.
Uh, but he was in Chicago. My,

139
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:52,580
my family was in Chicago, my mother
and father, my brother, I wasn't born.

140
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,140
I was born during World War II.
And so we didn't have to go to camp.

141
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,633
Uh,

142
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:03,910
mostly the 95% of Japanese Americans at
that time or any one of Japanese descent

143
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,400
live on the west coast in California,
Oregon,

144
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,590
Washington state,
Colorado.

145
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,570
And so when the war hit Pearl Harbor Hit,
uh,

146
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,490
uh, President Roosevelt signed
executive order nine zero six six,

147
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
which called for the all people of
Japanese descent to be evacuated from the

148
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:34,661
west coast and putting concentration
camps in the inner part of the country,

149
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,220
basically in deserted
desert areas. And, uh,

150
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,170
these camps, they euphemistically
referred to them as relocation centers,

151
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,080
but they were really kind of my standard,
you know,

152
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:53,081
your standard concentration camp with
Bob wire fences with machine guns facing

153
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:58,070
in not out and people not being
able to come and go as they pleased.

154
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,460
130,000 people of Japanese descent were
put in these camps and two thirds of

155
00:11:05,481 --> 00:11:09,650
them were American citizens,
not aliens.

156
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,810
Okay. And no trials? No, no.

157
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,690
Uh, uh, the only crime that
they had committed was the,

158
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,840
the color of their skin and their fact
that they were of Japanese descent.

159
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,070
And so did your family avoid that
because they were in Chicago?

160
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,240
Yeah, we all need like three or
400 of us in Chicago at the time.

161
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:37,250
And we weren't considered a threat.
But my other, the rest of my family,

162
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,280
my grandparents on my mother's side
and my cousins and aunts and uncles,

163
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,630
they were all in California
and they all got evacuated.

164
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,820
Just imagine this, you're, it's a Friday
night and you got a knock on your,

165
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,390
okay? It's the local FBI agent
and he says on Monday morning,

166
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:03,391
be at the corner of Washington and
State Street with two suitcases.

167
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,280
End of communication,
okay. And you, you know,

168
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,700
you don't have time to do hardly
anything. And you, you know,

169
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,550
you go there and then
you're put on a train,

170
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,440
you don't know where you're going and you
wind up in a camp and you're there for

171
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:24,790
three years. Okay? So let's say you're a,

172
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:28,880
you're an owner of a small
business. You lose the business, uh,

173
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,450
you no longer have a job,
right?

174
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:35,410
So he can't pay your mortgage
and things like they lost,

175
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,030
they lost everything. And now you're
18, let's say you're 18 years old,

176
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,220
okay. And this happened
to your family, right?

177
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,630
And the local army recruiter
comes to the camp and says,

178
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:51,340
I want you to go die for your
country. You know, frankly, Jocko,

179
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:54,970
I don't know what I would've done.
I might have told the guy to take a walk,

180
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,283
you know,
or

181
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:01,250
his other words. So many of
them joined up absolutely. The,

182
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,620
the hundreds of of town in the 442nd
regimental combat team. That's right. And,

183
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,640
and those guys fought with incredible
bravery and had some critical battles that

184
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:14,820
turned some the tied in some
critical situations as well.

185
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,131
Yeah.

186
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:19,930
They were the most highly
decorated infantry unit and
the history of the United

187
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,810
States army for its size
and time of service.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,270
And there were a regimental combat team,

189
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,710
let's say about 4,500
soldiers because they had, uh,

190
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,230
in an artillery battalion and other
things there were attached. Okay.

191
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,450
In about 18 months of combat,

192
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,290
they were awarded over
9,000 Purple Hearts.

193
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,660
You know, some guys said three or
four, you know, and if not more,

194
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,920
and, uh, you know, present the
presidential unit citation,

195
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,330
you're familiar with that award.

196
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:53,950
There are Army divisions that
never got that award. Okay.

197
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,400
That regimental combat team was awarded
eight presidential unit citations.

198
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,890
That's unbelievable. Yeah. They
were my personal heroes. So that's,

199
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,910
and that was to kind of get back
to your question and that was, uh,

200
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:11,290
one of the reasons that I
wanted to join the army.

201
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,840
I was actually going to
ask that. So, you know,

202
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:15,650
you're sitting here saying if
you were in one of those camps,

203
00:14:15,651 --> 00:14:18,290
you don't know if you would've might've
had to tell him to go take a walk,

204
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:21,260
but when your time came, you, you, you,

205
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,170
you walked into the recruiter's
office not away from it.

206
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,690
Yeah. Well, uh, in my case, uh,

207
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,940
when I was in high school, uh,
as I told you, uh, you know,

208
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,270
faith is a very strong
part of my whole life.

209
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,610
I've been so blessed in life
beyond anything I deserve.

210
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,420
And, uh, so when I was
our church, you know,

211
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:49,920
we go to church every Sunday. I was
in the choir, I was in cub scouts,

212
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:53,570
I was in boy, I was in
the youth group. You know,

213
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:58,040
all of this was centered around the
church. You know, when I was in scouts,

214
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:01,340
I went to the national jam
brewery in Valley Forge,

215
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:06,341
Pennsylvania with 52,000 of my
best friends living in tents and,

216
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,500
but you know,
that was in,

217
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,530
what was the symbol of that jam burry
George Washington at Valley forge,

218
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:19,780
kneeling in prayer and the motto
of scouting is for God and country.

219
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,660
So that was really my model.
And then I was in a boy's state.

220
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,660
Are you familiar with boys state? No.
Boy State is an American Legion program.

221
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,620
Does that still exist? Yes, yes. And it's,

222
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,510
it's been around probably for 50 years
now and I went, it was a 2050 or, okay,

223
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,130
so it's more than 50 years.

224
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,430
And the concept of boy's state as they
take junior high school juniors ready to

225
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:50,651
go into senior year and
who are leaders basically.

226
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,160
And they form a quasi state government
for two weeks and they actually divided

227
00:15:58,281 --> 00:16:01,940
into two political parties. They don't
call them Republicans in their requests.

228
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:06,770
They call him something else. And,
and they have state government,

229
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,820
county government and
local city government.

230
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,270
And you run for offices and you actually
have to come up with a platform and you

231
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:21,500
debate. And so it's a, it's
a list lesson in civics.

232
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,530
Okay. But it was sponsored
by the American Legion.

233
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,280
So we all lived in like
dorms and the dorms.

234
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,930
We had to make our beds so you could
bounce a quarter on it. You know,

235
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,990
they were all army blankets, stuff
and cots and, but it was wonderful.

236
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,410
It was just a great experience. But, uh,

237
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,740
so when I was in high school, uh, I,

238
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,990
but I was very active in my church,
in my, I'm kind of a driven guy.

239
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,100
And, uh, I was the
president of my, my, uh,

240
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,440
high school youth group
at the church and none,

241
00:16:54,441 --> 00:16:57,920
I became the vice president
of the Chicago Association.

242
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,420
Where did you play sports? No.
Well, I was, uh, no, I didn't.

243
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,310
I was in a, what about your grades?
I was, I was Valedictorian of my,

244
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,160
of my grammar school and high school.
And

245
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,620
they have Valedictorian in grammar school.
That shows you where,

246
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,980
how well I did in grammar school.
I didn't even know that.

247
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,110
And then I, I, uh, I always in the
band, I played clarinet and saxophone,

248
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,820
so I was the first chair clarinet of the
band that was the principal would win

249
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,860
in New York is Straw and, and
so, but anyway, I was, uh,

250
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,290
I was very active in my
church youth group and I,

251
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,930
I was thinking of becoming a minister.
Okay.

252
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,320
But then I was in junior ROTC and Chicago
has the nation's largest junior ROTC

253
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:45,860
program,
about 30 high schools have it.

254
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,640
And it's a great program. People, j Rotc,

255
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,660
they think it's a feeder for
the military. Okay. I mean,

256
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,840
some of them do go into the military,
but that's not the purpose.

257
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,140
The purpose is to give these high school
students something other than gangs to

258
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:09,351
belong to the give them experience in
leadership and discipline and teamwork.

259
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,810
And it's, it's a tremendous
program. So I was in junior ROTC

260
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,580
was,
so it's that combined with your,

261
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,750
your view of the,
like the 442nd,

262
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,760
those things are kind of starting to
congeal in your head and maybe move you

263
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:30,530
towards a military.

264
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,950
Yeah. And then in addition to that, I
have just one sibling, an older brother,

265
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,370
he's about seven years
older than I am. And, uh,

266
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,900
he joined the army as an enlisted guy,
but in the first year of college,

267
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:47,860
he was in a, a military fraternity
called Pershing rifles. Uh,

268
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:53,060
which other people like Colin Powell and
some mothers have been including myself

269
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,720
when I went to the u of I. And, uh,

270
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,270
and you have to understand also that
I'm Japanese American in the Japanese

271
00:19:02,311 --> 00:19:04,230
culture,
the warrior,

272
00:19:04,231 --> 00:19:08,910
the Samurai is at the top
of the social strata. Okay.

273
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,970
Unlike China where the scholar
was at the time in Japan,

274
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:17,460
it's the warrior.
So when I joined the military,

275
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:21,630
when I became a commissioned officer,
my dad was so proud,

276
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,890
you know, his, his small t shirts
swelled the large, you know,

277
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,890
and when I became a journal,
it's like, you know,

278
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,750
any incredible, but I
you so, so I'm rolling.

279
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,280
Do ROTC in college as well?
Yes.

280
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,210
Oh yes. See, I'm, I'm a driven
guy, right. And, and uh, I was,

281
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,830
here's, here's the thing
though, as I told you,

282
00:19:46,831 --> 00:19:48,540
I was thinking of becoming a minister,

283
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,080
but then I also wanted
to serve in the military.

284
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:57,540
So what do you think I would do chaplain
perhaps. Exactly. Little problem.

285
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,990
I'm Protestant and my denomination
theologically went so far away from what I

286
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:12,210
believed in that I couldn't
buy the theology. So now
I'm praying to God. Right.

287
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,950
And I'm saying I get the message, I guess
you want me to do my military thing.

288
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,320
So that's what I did. Okay.
But you fast forward 50 years,

289
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,600
55 years.
What am I doing today?

290
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,530
I'm doing what I wanted to do when I
was in high school cause I have military

291
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:32,370
outreach USA,
a faith based nonprofit that I started.

292
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,340
So that's a lesson in prayer.

293
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,360
And that is at that time I
thought God was telling me no,

294
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,080
he wasn't telling me
no. He was saying, wait,

295
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,580
it's on my schedule. Not on
your schedule. I mean, you know,

296
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,140
I wasn't enough either as a,
as a military guy,

297
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,760
Norris in my face.

298
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,540
So what year was it that
you're showing up in college?

299
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,030
Uh,
61

300
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,910
61 I started four years of college.
It's 1965 right.

301
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,770
Vietnam is really not escalated yet.
At that point.

302
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,023
Did you think

303
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,960
it was pretty hot at that time?
And I, I basically, by that time I,

304
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,860
I, I was not in the military
thing. Right, right.

305
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:20,120
I wasn't going to be a chaplain anymore,
so I was, I was in Persian rifles.

306
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,960
I was under rifle team. I was
on the drill team, you know,

307
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:27,800
if it smelled military, I always
in, okay. Now yet, give me,

308
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:32,420
remember I had four years of high school
ROTC also before I went to Benning.

309
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,270
You're pretty good at your drill.

310
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,650
Had, I mean, I mean, infantry,

311
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:41,790
I OBC infantry officer's basic
course piece of cake. I mean, I,

312
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,840
I went through that. I was an
undergraduate and my class, and in fact,

313
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:50,160
this is really funny, my class about 200,
you know, brand new second lieutenants,

314
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:50,994
right.

315
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,030
About a third of it was a national guard
and then about a third were reserves.

316
00:21:57,421 --> 00:22:00,030
And there are only a few of us
that were regular army. See,

317
00:22:00,031 --> 00:22:04,740
I've got a distinguished military graduate
commission, Regular Army Infantry.

318
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,670
Right. And so very few of us
were regular army in my class.

319
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,150
So our attitude was not really the best,
shall we say.

320
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,610
And so we get the Benning and they,
they marched us to class.

321
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,960
I mean this was an, to us it was
insane for second lieutenants. Yeah.

322
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,050
Just tell us where the building
is. We'll get there. Right? No,

323
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:28,530
we had the march in formation.
So needless to say,

324
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:32,580
the attitude was not real good with my,
with my company.

325
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,470
So the day we graduated, okay.
They used to have a award,

326
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:41,880
a streamer that companies could put on
their guide on those called the tiger

327
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:46,440
tactics award. This was were
really Gung Ho, you know,

328
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:50,250
companies and all that, which ours
was not needless to say. Well,

329
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,280
the night before we stole from another
company and we put it on our guide on.

330
00:22:55,531 --> 00:23:00,510
So on graduation day, we march by the
headquarters and outcomes, the commander,

331
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:04,020
the guys live it and you say, where'd
you guys get that? Oh, you know,

332
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,180
it's just appeared

333
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:10,760
and we were graduating and then what's
the guy going to do to us? Right. So we,

334
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,050
we all graduated and that was it.

335
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,100
So, uh, so 1965, didn't you
go to er, you went to, uh,

336
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,260
you went to graduate school hereafter?

337
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,220
Yeah. Here's the thing. Um,
you know, I told you I had the,

338
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,460
we didn't have a lot of money
for me to go to college,

339
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,310
so I knew I had to earn it myself.
Right.

340
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,510
So when I was in high school,
my senior year,

341
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,820
I worked 33 hours a week.

342
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:43,570
I worked from five til 10 o'clock at
night at a warehouse in Chicago and I

343
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:47,480
worked eight hours on, so
I could raise money. Okay.

344
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:51,140
I also played in two bands. I told
you I played clarinet and saxophone.

345
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,040
I played in a Polish band for,
for weddings.

346
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,910
And that was so cool because by the
third set, everybody was so blasted,

347
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,260
nobody cared.
And then I also played in a Jewish band.

348
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,580
So I used to play for Bar Mitzvahs.
I knew all the temples in Chicago.

349
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,590
I used to tell people I had them coming
or going either way. And then I had to,

350
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:12,771
you know,

351
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:17,360
I took out to the government loans and
that's the only way I could afford to go

352
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:20,920
to school. And so, so 65
rolls around, I graduate

353
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,310
and I find this interesting for a,
for a real obvious reason.

354
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,130
You majored in English in college?

355
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,250
Yeah. The reason I did that Jocko
was once again, you know, I'm,

356
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,500
I'm pretty focused guy in my,

357
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,460
my focus was on becoming the best officer.

358
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:42,270
I could be the best leader I
could be of infantry soldiers.

359
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,760
And I knew I was going into combat,
right?

360
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,240
So as a freshmen I tried to determine
what am I going to major in to prepare me

361
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,473
for that.

362
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,190
So I looked at psychology
and I looked at English,

363
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,890
not rhetoric, but
English literature. Okay.

364
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:03,960
I rejected psychology and my first year,
because we had these classes,

365
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,570
classes with Pavlov and his dogs
and all this stuff, you know,

366
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,160
and I'm going through that and I said,
what does this have to do at people?

367
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,420
You know? I mean I want to learn how
to, you know, work with people, well,

368
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:19,740
literature, whether you read the
whole continuum of, you know,

369
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:24,270
every man, your Shakespeare or
Hemingway, if you read that stuff,

370
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,490
there are universal traits of human
nature, they'd come out at you. Okay.

371
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,560
If you can understand that, you can
realize what motivates people. Okay.

372
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:36,420
So I,
and then not only that,

373
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:39,870
but if you read the best
writers of all time,

374
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,770
I just felt by sure osmosis gun,
not the smartest guy,

375
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:46,320
just by sure Osmosis,
you know,

376
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:49,230
I could absorb that and I
could express myself better.

377
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,240
So that's why I majored in English.

378
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,870
I've talked about that. I was, I was
an English major as well. I was, I was,

379
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,010
I was prior enlisted,

380
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,070
so I had been in for eight years and
actually I'd been in for 10 years by the

381
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:06,010
time I went to college and I knew right
away I was going to be an English major.

382
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:07,630
And the reason I wanted to be
an English major, because I had,

383
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,090
I'd gotten commissioned
and serve two years in the,

384
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,970
in the seals before I went to college.

385
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,520
As an officer and I realized
you got to write everything.

386
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,850
You got to read directives from people
and got to understand what they're saying

387
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,680
and then you're going to
communicate with your troops.

388
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,860
And I wanted to have a good command
of the English language. The,

389
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,510
the part that you talked about,

390
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,710
the understanding of human nature was
something that I saw once I got in and I

391
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:30,241
started reading it.

392
00:26:30,241 --> 00:26:32,890
It's an art start applying and
thinking about when I was reading it.

393
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:36,850
Now this is something that I,
that I advocate for everyone to,

394
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,520
if you want to really understand
human nature, got to read.

395
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,200
Yeah. Yeah. So I was, so, I was,

396
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,840
you know,
when I said that in 1965 the war,

397
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,130
cause what was it, what year was I
drank? 19 that was 1965 wasn't it?

398
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:58,220
The Battle of I drank, I
think it was, I think you're,

399
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,160
I think it was 1965 I think it was.
And you know,

400
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:06,420
they kind of use that as, hey, this
is when the real escalation started.

401
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,201
And,

402
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,500
and the reason I asked
you that specifically is
because I've had some Vietnam

403
00:27:10,501 --> 00:27:13,230
vets on that we're going to
college in 1965 and they were like,

404
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,570
they didn't even hadn't even
heard of Vietnam at that point.

405
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,720
So I guess it was because I was in ROTC.

406
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:22,580
You know how it's kind of paying
more attention. Yeah. You know,

407
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,070
and I knew I was going to Benny.
I mean that was a foregone conclusion.

408
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:28,560
And you knew you were going to combat
as well. Oh yeah. That was your mind.

409
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,360
Well, I, yeah, cause that was my goal.
Yeah. Be An infantry officer and you know,

410
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:38,590
if I, you know, that's, that
to me was where I wanted to go.

411
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,830
And S and so in 65 I got an,

412
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,480
I got an offer to get an
assistantship, uh, you know, to,

413
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,810
to be, uh, really a counselor in the dorm,

414
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,410
but it's like I died and
went to heaven because they,

415
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,600
they paid for tuition and fees and
I got like 100 bucks a month salary,

416
00:27:57,701 --> 00:28:00,010
which to me was like
richest guy in the world.

417
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,440
But the important thing was I could get
my master's degree. Okay. And by the way,

418
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:08,890
I got it in a year because I
went to summer school. I, I just,

419
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,810
I'm wanting to go on active duty, but
this was a chance for me to go, you know,

420
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:16,270
under the assistant ship
and not have to pay for it.

421
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,860
But now the pragmatism kicks in
for me, you know, cause you know,

422
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:23,750
we leave with an English degree
is, you know, you know, it's,

423
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:28,690
it's great for preparing
you to understand things,

424
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:29,920
but you know,

425
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,910
that and 50 cents in those
days we get me a cup of coffee.

426
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,500
So I,

427
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:39,160
and then I knew I was going to go into
combat and I knew I was going to be an

428
00:28:39,161 --> 00:28:42,820
infantry officer in the odds of my,

429
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,330
perhaps getting wounded, you
know, we're fairly decent,

430
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,470
so I need to have a fallback, you
know, and I wasn't an accountant,

431
00:28:50,471 --> 00:28:53,290
so I wasn't a CPA or you know,
something like that.

432
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,590
So I got my master's in the
teaching of social studies,

433
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,790
so I could be a teacher and you know,

434
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,620
you don't have to run the hundred yard
dash to be a teacher. And so, and I,

435
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:07,090
and teaching as a noble profession
and I always felt that, um,

436
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,170
you know,

437
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:13,170
it's something I could do if I got wounded
and still contribute to society and

438
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,100
70 well,
you know,

439
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,120
the 75% of your time is an
officer or senior NCO is teaching,

440
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,650
you know. So I figured I want
to find out how the pros do it.

441
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,170
Allegedly what I found out is the military
has the best education system really

442
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:30,520
does.
You know,

443
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:35,290
I didn't have to get my master's degree
in history and philosophy of education

444
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,890
and ed psych and all that
stuff. No, didn't need it.

445
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,870
So you, you wrap up, you get your
master's degree and now you, you know,

446
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:46,330
you're going to Vietnam. What, what
happens is that when you graduate.

447
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:50,270
Okay. So I, I go to Fort Benny,
I go to Iop, see, and you know,

448
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:53,750
I'm an undergraduate and my class,
so I didn't finish that story. This,

449
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:58,630
my my like class that I was in, you
know, really bad attitudes guys.

450
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,530
Right. On the day of graduation, they
announced the honor graduates. Okay.

451
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:04,880
I was in the third platoon.

452
00:30:04,881 --> 00:30:08,660
So first platoon they announced
the undergraduates in the platoon,

453
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,800
second platoon, they announced the
undergraduates third platoon, which I am.

454
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:17,480
Then I'm the only guy who,
an undergraduate out of my platoon,

455
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,440
when they announced my name,
everybody boots

456
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,040
because I ruined our record. Right.
So what happened is I volunteered for,

457
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:32,200
I volunteered for a while. I was regular
army, so I had the, I had to go airborne.

458
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,450
I volunteered for ranger school,
but in those days,

459
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:39,530
the West pointers all was mandatory.
They had to go to ranger school.

460
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,490
So I graduated at the same time
that the west pointers did.

461
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,990
They took up all the quotas. So I didn't
have, I couldn't get into ranger school,

462
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,560
but I had a solution. See, I'm always
thinking ahead. I was going to,

463
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,690
I applied for pathfinders school,

464
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,710
so I figured I'd go through pathline
your school, I'd finished that.

465
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:02,150
The West pointers would be gone. I could
slide into the next ranger class. Right.

466
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,470
They didn't give me Pathfinder, so
now I'm stuck. Right. So I said, okay,

467
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,820
I'm volunteering from Vietnam
and they sent me to Korea.

468
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,050
So I was in the DMZ in Korea,
which is really a god thing. I,

469
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:19,940
I've got to tell you this because I was
putting a second id on the DMC and those

470
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:24,230
days you were, you were assigned and you
stayed there for 13 months on the DMZ

471
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,320
and there was still active combat
patrolling and take casualties.

472
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,220
Yeah.

473
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,900
13 months I was there,
we had 12 Kia in about 40 wounded.

474
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,910
Okay. So this was not a walk
in the park. And uh, it was,

475
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:44,740
it was a great experience for me because
in addition to see, we were in the DMZ,

476
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:48,160
we actually had a company compound.
Okay.

477
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,970
And we actually had our guard mount,
you know,

478
00:31:51,971 --> 00:31:56,380
and we had our own NCO club and we
had, and, and so we had all the,

479
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,820
all the bs of the admin stuff that
you do on when you're in garrison.

480
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,990
But we are doing combat
patrolling every day on the DMZ.

481
00:32:04,991 --> 00:32:06,380
So it was really a,

482
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,790
a great experience for me as a young
officer because I was able to lead troops

483
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:16,600
out on patrol.
But also I had to do all this admin stuff,

484
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:18,130
you know,
the garrison.

485
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,340
And so that was your platoon commander
tour. What were the patrols like?

486
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:23,174
Where were you doing?

487
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:23,960
Um,

488
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,960
basically they were ambushed patrols
because the DMZ was set up where it was a

489
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,730
free fire zone.

490
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,900
If you saw anyone you could shoot him
cause nobody was supposed to be there.

491
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:40,700
Okay. And we would have
to say a Korean Chung, he,

492
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:42,950
which is tell him to stop,
you know,

493
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:47,330
but how many times would you say debt
before you pulled the trigger? Basically.

494
00:32:47,331 --> 00:32:50,390
But we,
we did ambush patrolling primarily.

495
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,350
And that was,
you said you were lucky you were,

496
00:32:54,351 --> 00:32:56,370
you said it was God
that put you there and,

497
00:32:56,371 --> 00:33:01,371
and do you feel that because that's
just a really good sort of warm up for

498
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:06,410
combat? Absolutely. Absolutely.
I feel that way. My first
appointment to Iraq was,

499
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,330
was relatively,
it was relatively easy,

500
00:33:11,331 --> 00:33:15,080
right? We were in, in Baghdad,
things were going pretty well.

501
00:33:15,081 --> 00:33:20,081
We had the upper hand on the enemy and
we didn't get into too much major combat.

502
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:22,730
You know, we've gotten a few
firefights here and there,

503
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:27,731
but wasn't like when I got from Adi and
I felt like that I was really blessed to

504
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:32,861
have had an experience where you get the
kind of the initial nervousness out of

505
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:36,520
your system and you realize, okay,
I can do this. That, that was,

506
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,030
I felt pretty lucky about that.

507
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,310
Well, also, you know, keep in mind,

508
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:44,840
I was just a young second lieutenant
shave tale. What did I know really?

509
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,550
And I was once again, blessed, I
had a platoon sergeant who really,

510
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:54,320
he was a Korean War veteran guy
was actually in east seven. Okay.

511
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,090
And, and basically when I got there,
you know, I was his lieutenant.

512
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,350
Okay. So nobody screwed around
with me. But on the other hand,

513
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,910
I listen real carefully. I mean
I, that's one thing I learned.

514
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,200
You know, I as a young officer, uh,

515
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,290
I've had my success in the military
because I had great and CEO's who made me

516
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:22,640
look good and I had commanders
who mentored me and didn't
cut my head off when I

517
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:25,010
screwed up.
And I've made my fair share of mistakes.

518
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,360
You get done with that tour. And then
what's your, what's your next assignment?

519
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,060
So,
you know,

520
00:34:32,061 --> 00:34:35,850
you get your dream sheet right a lot
where you want to go when you do her off,

521
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:40,280
so when you leave that area.
And so I put it in for Fort Bragg,

522
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:43,410
for Fort Benning, cause I want to go
to an airborne unit cause I was urban,

523
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,970
but I had never served in an airborne
unit. Right. They sent me to Fort Lewis,

524
00:34:46,971 --> 00:34:51,140
Washington. So I go to Fort
Lewis, Washington to the,

525
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,030
uh, uh, the training center,
infantry training center. Okay.

526
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:01,190
And when I get there,
I made a long story short,

527
00:35:01,191 --> 00:35:04,260
when I was in Korea, uh, I also was, uh,

528
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,450
they found out I had a master's degree,
so they pulled me off the line.

529
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:13,300
And, uh, the battalion commander
calls me into his office, right? So I,

530
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,610
I go down there and he says,
uh, Lieutenant Mccoy Yama, uh,

531
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:22,040
how you doing sir? I'm having
a great time. You know, I'm,

532
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,320
I'm with soldiers, you know, we're
doing combat patrolling, you know,

533
00:35:27,321 --> 00:35:31,910
and I really, this is what I've
been trained to do, you know,

534
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,780
and, and he's so I'm
happy. Okay. So he says,

535
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,770
I see you have a master's. I
said, yes, sir. And he said,

536
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,431
you know,

537
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:46,431
our battalion adjutant is leaving
and you have a degree in English,

538
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,650
you can see where this is
all going, right? And I said,
yes, sir. And he said, well,

539
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,660
how would you like to be the
battalion adjutant? And I said, sir,

540
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:02,370
I'm honored that you would even consider
this, but you know, I'm really happy,

541
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,450
you know, leading soldiers.
And he said, lieutenant,

542
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,050
I'm not looking for
happiness in my battalion.

543
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,380
You will report on Monday
morning. Yes sir. Okay,

544
00:36:13,381 --> 00:36:17,490
so off I went and, uh, and I
became the battalion out unit.

545
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,030
But that once again was a great
experience for me cause I,

546
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,620
I learned a lot of the admin
stuff and unfortunately,

547
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:32,040
and some I also saw some bad stuff
going on, which I was not happy with.

548
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,690
I saw, you know, I, because
I was the ad unit. Oh,

549
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,490
what I didn't tell you was
that was that battalion level.

550
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,240
The brigade unit left and they called
me up to brigade to be the brigade.

551
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:48,120
Now I'm a first lieutenant
that's a majors position. Right.

552
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,380
But I happen to be pretty obvious the
best battalion they had, you know,

553
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:55,470
not all the Italians.
So I go up there,

554
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,100
I go up there to brigade
to be the brigade ad unit.

555
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,100
And what I found was,
you know,

556
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,830
the officer efficiency
reports and the Oers,

557
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,010
I knew all the battalion
commanders because I dealt
with them all. Okay. So if,

558
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:10,770
if I,

559
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:15,770
Jim Mccoy Yama were to rate the battalion
commander's based on their leadership.

560
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,600
Right. And I would have rated
them one, two, three, four. Okay.

561
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,650
But I saw the reports going through
in was four, three, two, one.

562
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,000
And, and, and that's because
they were looking for managers,

563
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,780
not commanders.
And so that was a,

564
00:37:34,781 --> 00:37:37,440
that was a tough pill to swallow.
So

565
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,870
eyeopening for you as a young,
yeah. I know when I worked for,

566
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,760
I was the admiral's aid.
I saw,

567
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,490
I didn't see stuff like that that
turned me off, but I saw it just,

568
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:51,820
just getting a better grip on what was
happening behind the scenes was very

569
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,270
important for me and helped me
out, you know, later on. Um,

570
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,180
and when you were in Fort Lewis, that's
when you first met Hackworth, right?

571
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:04,230
Absolutely. Quick. This was so cool.

572
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,450
When I'm in when hand, now I'm a
captain by this time I'm a captain.

573
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,320
Right.

574
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,320
And I met the under
secretary general of the SDS.

575
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,990
Uh, I was the secretary,
the general staff. Okay.

576
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,190
What that means is I was the assistant
for the chief of staff, basically.

577
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,380
And so I,

578
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,070
yeah. Do you know who Hackworth was? We

579
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:36,910
all, we all, I mean hack was a legend.
You know, everybody knew who he was.

580
00:38:36,911 --> 00:38:39,640
But also because I had that job,

581
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,880
one of my functions was always the guy
who coordinated the general schedule and

582
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,921
the chief to staff schedule and Hackworth
was reporting into Fort Lewis as a new

583
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:55,510
battalion commander. Okay. Well whenever
a new battalion commander came in,

584
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:00,400
I always did research on the person,
you know, so I could tell the general,

585
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:03,760
you know, here's the guy who's coming,
here's his background. Well halfers was,

586
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,150
you know,
Mister infantry basically.

587
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:12,010
And so when he came to see the general,
he walks into the headquarters, you know,

588
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:16,060
I'm sitting behind his desk, he walks
in, so I stand up, you know, I say,

589
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:18,350
welcome Colonel Hackworth to Fort Lewis.
You know,

590
00:39:18,351 --> 00:39:22,300
the general will be with
you in 10 minutes. You know,
cause he came early, right?

591
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:27,250
The first words out of Hackworth
smile. I'm not kidding. First words,

592
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,470
what do you doing? Sitting behind a
desk? He said, you should have a company.

593
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,610
You said, if you want one,
I'll give it to you. Okay.

594
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,110
The guy doesn't know me from Adam.
Right. I mean, you know, and,

595
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,700
but you know, I was pretty sharp in
the way a warmer uniform. I did have,

596
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:50,590
you know, my jump wings and my ear, I
have an expert infantryman's badge. Okay.

597
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:54,580
Uh, and I had my EIB and that's
it. I didn't wear any ribbons,

598
00:39:54,581 --> 00:39:58,330
radar stuff and just the stuff
that counted as far as I was.

599
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:03,310
And so hacks on that, you
know, and, and I said, colonel,

600
00:40:03,311 --> 00:40:05,410
I really appreciate,
you know what you're saying,

601
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,440
but I came to the same conclusion that
you did a couple months ago and I've

602
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:15,811
already talked to a battalion commander
who's accepted me to take one of his

603
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:20,020
companies. So I'm committed to
him, sir. So I can't, you know,

604
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,300
I'd love to take you up on your offer,

605
00:40:22,301 --> 00:40:26,490
but I can't because I committed to the
southern battalion commander and hacks

606
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,120
that I understand. Totally. Okay,

607
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,230
well that turned out to be another God
thing because later on, as you know,

608
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:37,030
in the book, he and I got together and
we saved the career of a drill sergeant

609
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,023
[inaudible].

610
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:43,130
I just want to hear a little bit more
about this because it's something that I

611
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,020
haven't been able to gather from
anyone, you know, in my mind,

612
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,210
you know, I thought everyone must
look at hack, like, you know,

613
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,760
this guy's Mr infantry as you put it.
But I also would say to myself, well,

614
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:56,091
you know,

615
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:59,240
here's what I'm thinking that because he
wrote these books and because I studied

616
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:02,300
him,
but that was an actual thing.

617
00:41:02,301 --> 00:41:06,500
People knew who he was by his
reputation throughout the army.

618
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,390
Yeah. It was not only its reputation,
but his appearance. I mean, uh,

619
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:15,580
you know, his neck was probably the size
of my waist. I mean, this, you know,

620
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:19,490
a Hackworth was just, you know,
and he always had, you know,

621
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,500
he wasn't bald like today, you know,
but, uh, you know, eighth of an inch,

622
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,920
you know, razor sharp, you
know, sides and all that.

623
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,970
And what I didn't say is when he Hackworth
had this unique ability size people

624
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:38,390
up when he saw them, like
when he said that to me, and,

625
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,590
and I've said this
before, but hackers, uh,

626
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,900
his philosophy was you're either a
dud or a stud and there was nothing in

627
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:51,580
between. And he had
this uncanny, I've seen,

628
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,920
I've seen it dozens of times where he
actually did size guys up and I never saw

629
00:41:57,171 --> 00:42:01,160
him miss on that evaluation.
He just had this,

630
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,850
this instinct, you know, to
CISE guys up. And that's,

631
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,060
and that's why he was successful as a
commander because one of the principles is

632
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,260
to surround yourself with good people.

633
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:17,690
And so when he came to a unit and he
found some guys that weren't cutting it,

634
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:21,590
they were gone. I mean, especially in
combat, you know, he can't tolerate that,

635
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:26,010
you know, and he would, and he had
the strings that he could pull and

636
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:31,280
he had the relationships all over the
place it seems. That's right. Now how did,

637
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,990
when did he leave with two to go to
Vietnam and take over the battalion?

638
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,780
He probably let the,
see I left in May of 69,

639
00:42:40,781 --> 00:42:45,730
so it was probably end
of 68 or maybe early 69.

640
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,780
And, and he goes over and he's over there
for a few months and then he ends up

641
00:42:50,781 --> 00:42:53,540
needing, while he wants to surround
himself with good people again.

642
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:58,730
And so he reaches out to you? Yeah.
How does it, how does that happen?

643
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,030
Well, uh, you know, I,

644
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,970
I was still at Lewis as an ait
company commander and, and,

645
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,340
and another thing I should
tell you at that time,

646
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:14,970
and I'm not real happy with the army
because they never gave me any assignment

647
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,410
or anything I ever asked for four at
this point. Are you ready for this?

648
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:21,260
I,

649
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:26,020
I get what I didn't tell you was in
graduate school I majored in Japanese

650
00:43:26,021 --> 00:43:30,550
history and Chinese history and
political science and Japanese language,

651
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:34,240
uh, in my master's of
social studies. Okay.

652
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,720
And I happened to be Japanese American.

653
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,770
I haven't had a tour in Korea.
Right. Where, by the way,

654
00:43:41,771 --> 00:43:44,530
I didn't tell you I got some
awards from the Korean army.

655
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,620
And so now the army comes out with the
foreign area specialty training program

656
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:56,470
or fast. Okay. And the concept
was a great concept. You know,

657
00:43:56,471 --> 00:43:58,540
in Vietnam he got caught
with our pants down,

658
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:03,130
cause we don't have any army experts
in Vietnam. Nobody knew the culture,

659
00:44:03,131 --> 00:44:06,280
nobody knew the language,
the politics sound familiar.

660
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:09,430
And so basically the army said,
okay,

661
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:14,650
we're going to develop geographic
experts for the whole world.

662
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,100
Okay. And we're going to
call it the fast program.

663
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:21,700
So I saw that and it was in the
army times, you know, and they said,

664
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:26,320
if you have an interest
called this number, you know,
and so I called, you know,

665
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,130
and he said, hey look, pull up my record.
You know, you'll see. You know, I'm, I'm,

666
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,090
I got my master's degree and
fiery student affairs. Ethnically,

667
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:37,140
I'm Japanese,

668
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,200
I've got her a tour in Korea where I
got some awards from the Korean army.

669
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:47,610
Okay. And I'm regular army. Right.

670
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,980
What are my chances of getting in this
program that we should be 100% right.

671
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,460
Are you ready for this?
The first words out of your guy's mouth,

672
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,110
you haven't been to Vietnam.
And I said, well, that's right,

673
00:45:01,111 --> 00:45:02,940
but if you'll go back in my record,

674
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:08,670
you'll see I volunteered for Vietnam
in the army, sent me to Korea. Okay.

675
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,210
You said, but that doesn't count.
Okay. The second thing he said was,

676
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,520
you haven't been a career course advanced
course or officers. So he got me there.

677
00:45:17,521 --> 00:45:22,110
I hadn't, you know, I was
just a young camp and I hadn't
been there. So in essence,

678
00:45:22,111 --> 00:45:23,700
he was telling me,
you know,

679
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,790
come back in a couple of years and
maybe we'll think about it. You know,

680
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,330
he didn't give me any
encouragement. He didn't say, Hey,

681
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:35,010
you're a natural for this program. You
know, I'll keep on monitoring your career.

682
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:37,150
You know, he didn't do
any of that stuff. Okay.

683
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,540
And about that time I got the letter
from Hackworth saying, hey, Mukai can,

684
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:45,930
if we got a war going on, if you
want a company, it's yours. And like,

685
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,300
I hit the lotto, you know,
and I, and frankly I was, I
was sneaking of, you know,

686
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,240
resigning my regular army commission,
but I hadn't been to Vietnam yet.

687
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,650
And Alyssa Bachelor,

688
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:59,820
I had a lot of my friends who were married
who are going back for their second

689
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:04,440
and third tours, you know, and I felt an
oblique and not only that, but I figured,

690
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:08,280
well, maybe if I go, I'll
change my mind, you know,

691
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,460
and serving under Hackworth who would
be the best opportunity I could,

692
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,190
I could have. So I jumped at it,
you know, and I went, but, uh,

693
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:16,930
things did not.
Right.

694
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,060
How did you get orders?
I mean, do you know,

695
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:21,430
I know Hackworth had some
relationships with people,

696
00:46:21,431 --> 00:46:25,740
but just to get a guide deployed to
be in his battalion, how did you pull,

697
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,370
how do you pull that off?
What did it look like?

698
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:31,630
Well, I mean, I, I called my
infantry officer assignment guy,

699
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:35,890
whom I never spoken to in the five
years I was on active duty. Right.

700
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,810
Cause I always felt that I
shouldn't be managing my own career.

701
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:45,820
You know, if I, if I did my job
that the army would, you know, I,

702
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,370
I be treated okay. You know
what, none of that ever happened.

703
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:53,020
So I called this guy at the
Pentagon and I say, Hey,

704
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,880
I'm volunteering for Vietnam again.
And he basically said,

705
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,040
well, okay, you know, give me your phone
number in case we lose connection here.

706
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,100
And, and then he said, and I
said, but I have a stipulation,

707
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,770
I need to go to the ninth division. And
he said, okay, I can make that happen.

708
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,230
When do you want to go? I said, as
soon as possible. This is February.

709
00:47:17,231 --> 00:47:20,620
And he said, well, I can get you
there in August. And I said, no,

710
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:24,370
that's not soon enough. He said,
how about April? I said, sold.

711
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,050
So I got orders to, you know, now
everybody told me in the world at that,

712
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,260
here I am, uh, infantry,

713
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:36,570
regular army captain going to
Vietnam. When I hit the Rep. Oh, devo.

714
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,900
Uh, they could assign me anywhere. You
know, orders meant nothing. You know,

715
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,220
it because captain, it's infantry.
Captain's wear a diamond dozen.

716
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,470
So when I get to Vietnam,
everything was greased.

717
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,340
Ninth Division.
I went from the night I went from,

718
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:59,110
from Saigon, right to the ninth
division at Dong Tam. You know,

719
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:03,210
I had land there, I got my orders
to his battalion. It's all right.

720
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,290
All Greece weren't,

721
00:48:04,291 --> 00:48:08,880
you're doing some kind of like Vietnam
indoctrination for a week long and hack

722
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:11,020
pulled you out two days into
it or something like that.

723
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,400
I have saw upset, they had a five day, uh,

724
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,710
in country training program for
newbies. Okay. Especially, you know,

725
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:26,930
well, you know, in the Delta, uh,
I'd say 85% of our casualties for,

726
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:31,790
from booby traps. And so we
were, and there was a special,

727
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:35,610
a terrain, you know, with
uh, rice patties and,

728
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,830
and canals and you know, just the
whole thing was totally different.

729
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:45,190
And so they had this five day training
course to acclimate you and to understand

730
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:48,230
the booby traps and the
terrain and all this stuff.

731
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:52,490
And I'm in a for two days and I'm pulled
out of the course and I'm put on a

732
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:57,491
helicopter and they take me down
to the battalion fire support base.

733
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:02,300
And I mattered in a wet hand,
you know, and I, I go to half
and I say, sir, you know,

734
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:06,600
how can you do this to me?
I mean, I'm trying to learn
how to stay alive, you know,

735
00:49:06,601 --> 00:49:10,850
it's like, and he said, look, you don't
need that stuff. I know you, you know?

736
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,500
Yes sir.
Yes sir.

737
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,910
And when you showed up,
so for those that hadn't read,

738
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:19,120
having read the books or listened
to the other podcasts about this,

739
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,740
Hackworth had showed up.

740
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,460
He was requested by name to go and
take over the four 39th in Vietnam,

741
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,640
which was a pro was, which was a battalion
that was having a lot of problems.

742
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:31,710
And he went in there and he
fixed it. I mean, that's,

743
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,200
there's no simple way to put it.
He went in there and,

744
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,930
and squared that battalion weigh in and
made them from hopeless to hardcore. Is,

745
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:39,813
is the,

746
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:44,620
the terms that get used when you showed
up that he'd already been there for a

747
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:46,990
while.
So things were pretty solid at that.

748
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:51,030
Oh, they were, they were so
good. It was incredible. In fact,

749
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,400
the first guy I met when I,
when I got there was our battalion s four,

750
00:49:56,401 --> 00:50:00,140
his name was Mario Takahashi.
He was actually a, uh,

751
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,400
a national guard guy from Hawaii.
You Eve is about six, two or six,

752
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:07,290
three big Japanese guy.
You know,

753
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,900
Nia was Hackworth,
Hackworth that could you just,

754
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:14,270
you made it sound what you said,
look, talking about his neck.

755
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:17,510
Was he like a big coffee in pictures?
He always looks pretty lean and,

756
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,580
and not very physically large. Wow. Well,

757
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,210
when I, I mean, he was stoked.
Okay. I mean, he wasn't,

758
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:28,140
he wasn't real huge. He
wasn't real tall. Uh,

759
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:32,330
but just the way he carried himself,
that's what I always was.

760
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:35,570
He was just a guy that if you walked
away and go, I bet that, you know,

761
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:39,440
how tall was Hackworth with o six.
Eight. Yeah. To find out is whatever,

762
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:43,880
five dinners. And not only that,
but I'll tell you, he went,

763
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:48,580
when I became a general, later on in
life and, and he came to one of my, uh,

764
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,640
every, every year, I used to have
a leadership conference for my,

765
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:58,030
my officers and my Nco said I would
invite speakers to come to and Hackworth

766
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:01,820
came, uh, to one of my conferences.

767
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:05,700
And then he visited me in Chicago
when he was doing his, uh,

768
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,340
about face book.
Right.

769
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,790
And so he invited me and my wife and
kids to have dinner with him one night.

770
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,600
You know, he always said, bring your kids,
you know, some guys would say, no, just,

771
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:19,550
you know,
being your wife or whatever,

772
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:23,150
because like kids were fairly
young then weren't real young.

773
00:51:23,151 --> 00:51:25,610
They were maybe eight or
nine, you know, at that time.

774
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:31,290
And my wife and the kids
actually commented about how
soft spoken ham worth was.

775
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,970
He wasn't a blustery
guy. Uh, uh, you know,

776
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:42,230
among guys. Yeah. But you know,
in the, in public with, you know,

777
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:46,590
women and family members,
he was, he was, uh,

778
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:51,030
a gentleman, which kind of surprised my
wife cause I had told him what I'm about,

779
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,980
you know. And so, but
that's, that's how he was.

780
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:00,380
And, and so the, the battalion,

781
00:52:00,381 --> 00:52:04,940
when you show up, it's just the guys are
really on board with what's going on. Oh,

782
00:52:04,941 --> 00:52:05,631
absolutely.

783
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:10,631
Because I got there probably
three weeks before our famous,

784
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:13,063
uh,

785
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:18,310
it wants me to be a battle on 22 may
where we decimated a VC training battalion

786
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,880
basically. Uh, and, uh, I mean,

787
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,250
I remember being at the talk,
you know, when he's planning,

788
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:31,880
while this Hackworth had
this innate quality get,

789
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:35,330
just smell out the enemy. You know,
even with all the intelligence,

790
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:37,460
we get all of this stuff,
you know,

791
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:41,300
he was able to figure out what
they were doing. And so he,

792
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:46,190
he set us up for that night. But to
answer to you address what you are saying,

793
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,650
by the time I got there,
Takahashi was the first guy I met.

794
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,220
He was really a s a strong straight you.
And he was the s four.

795
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:59,780
And so he got all the equipment for the
battalion and he got it whatever way he

796
00:52:59,781 --> 00:53:01,550
had to get it,
you know,

797
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:05,900
and then I meet the next guy I meet
is another is a company commander.

798
00:53:05,901 --> 00:53:08,960
And the guy was like six,
three or something, you know.

799
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,470
So I'm seeing a pattern here right
now and I'm five foot five. Okay.

800
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,540
But here's the cool thing about this.
One of the other company commanders,

801
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,030
his name was Don Meyer.
And by the way,

802
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:23,920
Hackworth had this really cool way of,
of uh,

803
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:29,620
using words and terms and titles
that you'll life our companies.

804
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:34,020
We're not Alpha Bravo, Charlie
Delta. They were alert,

805
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,170
battle clean more in dagger.
Okay.

806
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,330
And the claim,

807
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:43,260
or a company commander was
a guy by name of Don Myers.

808
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:48,620
Don Meyers was my roommate in college at
the University of Illinois and we both

809
00:53:49,141 --> 00:53:54,000
were infantry ROTC guys,
right? And then later he was,

810
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,640
he was with the hundred and
first and he was wounded.

811
00:53:56,641 --> 00:54:01,641
So they shipped him to Fitzsimmons and
then they assigned him to Fort Lewis,

812
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,200
which was where Hackworth and I were.

813
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:09,330
So Donna and I were roommates again
if Fort Lewis Washington. Okay.

814
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,190
So then half were ships to Vietnam
and he takes Meyers with him.

815
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,880
Okay. So Noel Meyers, who by the
way is six foot three. Right.

816
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,300
And his nickname was lank. And when
he and I were in college as roommates,

817
00:54:24,301 --> 00:54:28,230
it was like Mutt and Jeff, you
know, and I wasn't that tall guy.

818
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,930
And so anyway, uh, but as you,

819
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,540
as you can understand to have,

820
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:38,810
I commanded battled company and he come
in to claim our company and I knew that

821
00:54:40,531 --> 00:54:44,700
if we were going to run into any
cramp, you know, that he would,

822
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:48,240
he would be there for me and he
knew I would be there for him.

823
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:53,760
And that was, that was it
just, it was really good.

824
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,871
Yeah.
That,

825
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:59,871
that whole thing with names is something
that I completely ripped off from

826
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,020
Hackworth. When I was a task unit
commander, our tasking, it was called,

827
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,740
whether it was Alpha Bravo
and Charlie and I had bravo.

828
00:55:06,741 --> 00:55:08,120
And immediately when I took it over,

829
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:12,170
I changed the name from Bravo
to bruiser and that's was,

830
00:55:12,171 --> 00:55:14,270
that changed the attitude of people.
It really does.

831
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:17,720
So as you know,
all elite units have,

832
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:21,410
have greetings and chondricytes.
Right.

833
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:26,600
So for the hardcore are, our
motto was hardcore, we Condo,

834
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,060
that was what the reading was.
The countersign,

835
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:34,430
which I cannot say totally
was no effing slack.

836
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:39,650
Okay. But I'll tell you, there were
a guy, I saw this eye witnesses,

837
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:44,180
there were guys who were wounded on
stretchers and Hackworth would walk up to

838
00:55:44,181 --> 00:55:46,730
them and Nate salute him
and say hardcore Econdo

839
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,830
what kind of missions did you do
when you showed up there? So you're,

840
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,260
you take over your company commander.

841
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,950
Yeah, there were, they
were, they were Pramod. Uh,

842
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:04,020
they were just really a [inaudible]
search search and destroy.

843
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:08,800
Not really destroyed, but sir,
we were seeking out the VC.

844
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:14,080
Uh, but as it got closer
to, we knew we were leaving.

845
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:18,760
Right because President Nixon
had had said that, you know,

846
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:23,080
so it just got to be, you know, we
candy or you make sure they weren't,

847
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:23,861
if they were there,

848
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:28,060
we get into firefights if it didn't happen
very often because most mostly booby

849
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:31,900
traps and things. Uh, and uh,

850
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:35,920
basically that was it. I
mean, cause they, you know,

851
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,690
they're smart. They knew we were leaving.
So why going while you get into contact,

852
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,970
right. You're leaving now. You, you
were showing me some pictures earlier.

853
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,890
You're pretty famous picture
that got published. It's someone,

854
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,820
uh, your, your Rto had just been
wounded. What was the story?

855
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:54,370
Yeah,

856
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:59,370
this was one of our operations and there
was a booby trap then and he was a,

857
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:04,150
he got a sucking chest wound from it then.
And I got a little shrapnel, not a lot.

858
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,830
And uh,
uh,

859
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:10,690
basically I called in a medevac
helicopter and the helicopter came in.

860
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,830
Unbeknownst to us,

861
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:16,860
there was a UPI photographer on the
helicopter and he snapped a picture of my

862
00:57:18,761 --> 00:57:23,650
guys carrying my wounded Rto on a
stretcher towards the helicopter.

863
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:28,600
And that became like the UPI picture
for the day, the one around the world.

864
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:30,820
And you know,
the Vietnam photograph,

865
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,910
I didn't even know it existed
until three years later. I was out,

866
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:35,740
I was off of active duty.

867
00:57:35,741 --> 00:57:40,330
I was reading on US News and World
Report magazine and the picture was like

868
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:44,730
three inches by four inches
in the magazine. But it was
all my soldiers, you know,

869
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:47,740
and I saw it and they said, hey,
and then I saw I was in the picture,

870
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:52,180
so I'm kind of in the picture
so you can see me. So, uh,

871
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:54,310
I got the photo from,
from them.

872
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:59,690
I get asked a lot and it's something
that I don't have any experience with is

873
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,200
what it was like having draftees.
As you know,

874
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:07,560
I was in all of the all volunteer military
and then on top of that, you know,

875
00:58:07,561 --> 00:58:10,590
the unit I worked with, we were
all volunteered again. You know,

876
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:11,520
you volunteered to come in,

877
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,680
then you volunteer again to
try and be in the seal teams.

878
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:18,120
And people ask what it was
like working with draftees.

879
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:22,950
Now Hackworth opinion was draftees were
good because they didn't care about

880
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:25,710
their career. And if they thought
something was wrong, they'd say, hey,

881
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,670
this is crap. We don't want to do that. Or
Hey, you're not telling the truth to us.

882
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,150
And so he thought it was good
and it kept the army in check.

883
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:38,760
But there's still had to be
some leadership differences
in dealing with an end

884
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,280
later. In your career,
obviously you started working
with the all volunteer army.

885
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:45,360
What did you notice about the
draftees that you learned from?

886
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:48,890
Well, the draft, these just like,

887
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:52,790
and it doesn't make any difference
for your draftees or, or volunteers.

888
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:56,330
It depends on the leadership and you know,

889
00:58:56,331 --> 00:59:00,180
they'll respond the good leadership and,
uh,

890
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:05,810
the, the draftees were like anyone
else. Once you're in the position,

891
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:07,730
you're going to do the best you can,

892
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,650
especially when you're in Colombia
because you want to survive. And, and,

893
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:15,170
and by that time it gets to
be a bonding thing. You know,

894
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,950
you're not there fighting for liberty
and justice and the American way.

895
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,820
You're fighting for the guy to the right
view and the guy to the left of you

896
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,380
basically. Cause you go every day you're
living together, you're dying together,

897
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,740
you know?
And so it's,

898
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:34,100
it's a function of leadership and
of draftees were great guys. I mean,

899
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:37,250
I serve with them
anywhere. Uh, I, in fact,

900
00:59:37,251 --> 00:59:40,400
I didn't even know who is straight
and I didn't care. I didn't ask,

901
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,040
you know whether they're
draftees are volunteers,

902
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:46,780
although the vast majority of
our guys who were draftees in,

903
00:59:46,781 --> 00:59:48,940
in the fourth year to 39th wow.

904
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,820
And that's why it was so cool about it
that Hackworth could take that battalion

905
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,840
and turned it around. Mna heard stories
cause I came later on, you know,

906
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,590
but he had a price on his head initially.
Yeah.

907
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,700
Price on his head from his own guy.

908
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,230
Yeah.
Well yeah,

909
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:08,670
but nobody had the gonads
to step up and claim no.

910
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,400
Clean the price so to speak.
Yeah.

911
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,570
I mean one of the things he talks about,
and again,

912
01:00:12,571 --> 01:00:16,230
I've talked about this on other podcasts,
but you know, when he showed up,

913
01:00:16,231 --> 01:00:19,560
everyone had whatever they had guitars
and they had radios and they had,

914
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,640
you know, big hammocks for themselves
and, and he got there and said, okay,

915
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,880
anything that you can't carry on your
back is going to be in the middle of our

916
01:00:26,881 --> 01:00:29,160
base tomorrow morning.
It's getting shipped out on helicopters.

917
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,140
So people went crazy.
Are you kidding me?

918
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:35,100
Well, not only Dan, you know what
he did, and I'm sure you know this,

919
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:38,670
but he took away class Emile's Oh,
I did not know that.

920
01:00:38,671 --> 01:00:43,340
Or I don't remember it because
they were so, they were so, uh,

921
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:49,080
uh, how to say this nicely. They,
they were not disciplined. Okay.

922
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:52,170
Cause they had lousy
leadership before that.

923
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:55,230
And a Hackworth basically said,
you know,

924
01:00:55,470 --> 01:01:00,000
you guys are soldiers and he said,
I'm going to keep you alive, you know,

925
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:04,020
but you're going to have to soldier. So
he actually took classes away initially.

926
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:08,130
He made them shine their
boots. I mean, you know, stuff,

927
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:12,580
this sounds crazy, you know, but he
was getting their attention. Yeah.

928
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:15,860
You know, and, and cleaning weapons.
I mean, they would, you know,

929
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:18,840
they were not cleaning. I
mean, how crazy is that?

930
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:23,010
They weren't cleaning their weapons at
nighttime. There was a night discipline,

931
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,970
like discipline was almost
nonexistent. I mean, it was crazy.

932
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:31,440
And Hackworth made them, you
know, soldier up and, and, uh,

933
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:36,470
but then what happened was they started
to use his tactics and they found out

934
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:42,720
that, hey, this works. I mean, we're not
taking casualties. Like we did before,

935
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:47,460
we're actually inflicting casualties
that we weren't doing before.

936
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:53,000
And then he started to give stuff
back in or anyone else he did,

937
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:58,200
he took away beer.
Beer was like water,

938
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,480
you know, the average temperature was
like 95 degrees, you know, and all that.

939
01:02:03,481 --> 01:02:06,630
And it was like 3.2 whatever the beer was,
you know?

940
01:02:06,631 --> 01:02:10,980
But he took that away initially too.
And people thought he was nuts.

941
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,790
Yeah. Actually there's a great quote
about face at some guy writing home to as,

942
01:02:15,791 --> 01:02:19,120
this is a quote from a letter somebody
wrote down road, you know, my new car,

943
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:22,580
my new battalion commanders crazy.
I don't know what's going to happen.

944
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,890
That's literally a letter a guy ride home.
It's interesting to me.

945
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:30,660
So I've seen this, and I'm sure
you've seen this in your career,

946
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,370
I've seen it in the business world.

947
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,420
I'm sure you've seen in the business
world and in the military guys that go so

948
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:41,421
far in that direction of being so
hardcore and over the top that they break

949
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:47,640
their guys and people actually don't
like them and they don't want to serve

950
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:50,610
them. And they don't want to do
a good job because they're there,

951
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:55,560
they're too focused on stuff that doesn't
really matter. And Hackworth just,

952
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,680
he seemed to have this ability to balance
it so well between being hardcore.

953
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:01,980
And yet at the same time,

954
01:03:01,981 --> 01:03:05,190
everybody knows that he's going to
take care of him and he loves them.

955
01:03:05,930 --> 01:03:10,340
Yeah. That, that was the main thing
because they knew that they were going,

956
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,650
they were going to live under his
command if they followed what he said.

957
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,510
And there would be successful too.

958
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:22,010
Don't forget that success breeds success.

959
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:26,840
And so the hardcore is as
they kept on progressing,

960
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:30,690
became prouder and prouder
of, you know, and the guys,

961
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,550
it was just the,

962
01:03:33,551 --> 01:03:38,510
a unit that nobody wanted it to
reckon with it. And that's how it was.

963
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,920
But has led by example. I can't, I
just can't emphasize that enough.

964
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:44,510
Uh,
you know,

965
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:49,210
I have my leadership mantra,
which,

966
01:03:49,211 --> 01:03:51,780
uh, and I'm a simple guy, so I boils,

967
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:55,970
boil things down simply and
the three words, example,

968
01:03:56,360 --> 01:04:01,190
caring and balance. And you got to
lead by personal example. It's not,

969
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:04,310
you know, do what I say, but do what I do.

970
01:04:04,850 --> 01:04:09,350
And caring is to care for your soldiers.
Uh,

971
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:14,610
and you know, caring means,
especially in combat,

972
01:04:14,630 --> 01:04:18,680
keeping them alive, that's how you
care for him. And you train tough,

973
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:23,450
you know, I mean, Hackworth
always mentioned that, you
know, the harder you train,

974
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:27,770
you know, the, the better, the delt
performing kind of invent. And in fact,

975
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:31,610
sometimes it was easier in combat then,
you know, some of the training did,

976
01:04:31,611 --> 01:04:33,850
he'd make them go through and,

977
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:38,660
and finally his balance to especially
leaders. And I'm talking to leaders,

978
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:39,500
right?

979
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:44,500
And I always told my leaders that you've
got to maintain a balance between your

980
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:51,250
professional military job and your family.

981
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:54,920
And I used to tell my guy,
if you're not doing me any good,

982
01:04:54,921 --> 01:04:58,550
if you're going through a divorce,
you know, and too many guys,

983
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:03,551
it's easy when you get promoted to get
kind of caught up in the perks and then

984
01:05:04,081 --> 01:05:08,570
the responsibility, you know, so you
work harder to be more. And then when,

985
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,340
what do you do? You ignore your family
and then things fall apart. And,

986
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:17,560
uh, so I, I warned my, my
soldiers, I always said, you know,

987
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:21,900
maintain that balance. And I tried to
do that, not only personally but the,

988
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,290
to get my [inaudible] when we were
mobilized, for example, k my division now,

989
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:30,880
this was not, we didn't deploy
overseas. We were a training division.

990
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:34,660
Our war time mission was the
army reserves, by the way,

991
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,750
was the only service that had this.
We,

992
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:42,670
we had reservist who's wartime mission
was to take over the training of the

993
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:46,060
recruits at the active duty stations,

994
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:51,061
which would then release those active
duty soldiers to go join forces and made a

995
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:55,960
lot of sense. You know, so,
so, uh, when that happened,

996
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:58,690
uh, I, I went to my staff,

997
01:05:58,691 --> 01:06:02,080
now you have to understand this is
like the late eighties, right? Okay.

998
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,170
And I went to my staff and I said,

999
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,160
I want a 24 hour,

1000
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:13,120
800 number from my family support program.

1001
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,760
I want my soldiers to know,

1002
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:19,390
and I want their spouses to know
that while they're deployed,

1003
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,990
if there's any problems,
they can count on us.

1004
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,940
And I want it to be 24, seven
man. And he said, general,

1005
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:31,340
when you have to understand those days,
800 numbers were pretty expensive. And,

1006
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:35,290
and, and they said, you know, number one
is going to be expensive. Number two,

1007
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:39,700
you know, 24 seven you know,
and I said make it happen.

1008
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:41,840
Cause I,
I,

1009
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:45,700
the last thing I wanted my soldiers who
were deployed to worry about was their

1010
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:49,950
families. Right now none.
What I did is I, yeah,

1011
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:53,970
I had the two star stationary,
you know, as, as a major general,

1012
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:55,220
a little notes.
You know,

1013
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:58,150
they're not eight and a half
by 11 their little note things.

1014
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:03,450
So I told my staff I want to send a
personally signed note to every spouse or

1015
01:07:06,521 --> 01:07:11,521
significant other of a deployed soldier
in this division and I'm on a note to go

1016
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:18,370
to their employer because you have to
understand these are reservists, right?

1017
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:23,110
Okay.
So I had 1500 soldiers mobilized,

1018
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:27,820
right? So this is 3000 letters
that I'm going to sign. You know,

1019
01:07:27,821 --> 01:07:31,300
personally they wanted me
to use an auto auto pen.

1020
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:35,980
You don't buy it by computer
manufacturer, your signature. I said,

1021
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:40,540
no way. These are, these are
going, you know, so I, I did that.

1022
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:42,070
And what happened was I was,

1023
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:46,780
I had a cousin who's husband
was a steel seal salesman.

1024
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:49,840
Okay.
And she calls me one day and she said,

1025
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:51,340
you'll never know what
happened to my husband.

1026
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:55,810
He was making a call on
this company in Indiana.

1027
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:56,943
Okay.

1028
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:02,130
And on the wall was one of my letters
to them and he saw my name on it,

1029
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:04,023
you know.

1030
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:08,470
So caring for your caring
and balance is important.

1031
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:11,260
Um,
you know,

1032
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:16,010
you talked about

1033
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,640
that,

1034
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:21,020
that operation that was so well
planned and so well executed.

1035
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:23,500
And you talked about hack words,

1036
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:28,070
sort of sixth sense instinct.
Um,

1037
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:30,290
and then, you know, I've,

1038
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:35,291
I've heard you talk in some
other interviews about a
situation that you were in

1039
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,040
that was,

1040
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:41,870
that you described as really
sort of impacting your,

1041
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:47,150
your mental state.
And to me when I heard you talk about it,

1042
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,320
it seemed to be almost like
a turning point mentally,

1043
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:53,630
psychologically for you.

1044
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,760
And it had to do with you overrunning a
position and you end up with some, some,

1045
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:03,590
yeah, I didn't, I didn't realize the
impact of that incident until many,

1046
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:07,370
many years later.
But in order for me to explain that,

1047
01:09:07,371 --> 01:09:11,450
I have to talk about
something called moral injury,

1048
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:16,510
which is an when the so called
invisible wounds of war. Uh,

1049
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:21,860
a lot of people are familiar with
post traumatic stress disorder.

1050
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,520
A lot of people are aware
of traumatic brain injury,

1051
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:31,100
but when you ask them if
they could describe the
invisible wounds of war called

1052
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:35,690
moral injury, very few people
are, are knowledgeable about that.

1053
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:37,850
How long has that term been used?

1054
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:42,940
Uh, there was a, a, a psychiatrist
at the Va doctor, Jonathan Shay,

1055
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:48,070
who, uh, basically, uh,
coined that phrase in 2009.

1056
01:09:48,670 --> 01:09:53,670
So it's been around for a while and now
it's starting to really pick up steam in

1057
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:58,090
research because of the,

1058
01:09:58,160 --> 01:10:03,160
its significance in contributing to
the high suicide rate among veterans.

1059
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:07,250
And,
uh,

1060
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:12,100
the concept is when I go around
and I give presentations and,

1061
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:17,200
and I tell people the concept is so
intuitive, you'll get it in 30 seconds.

1062
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,850
Okay, so here it is fun the time
you're born until you're 18 years old.

1063
01:10:22,210 --> 01:10:24,610
You develop a personal moral code,

1064
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:29,590
sense of right or wrong that could
come from your family, your religion,

1065
01:10:29,591 --> 01:10:31,540
community, friends, whatever.

1066
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:36,790
And then you joined the military
and you learn a warrior code.

1067
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:42,450
The Warrior Code is super imposed on
your personal moral code and in fact

1068
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:44,020
transforms it somewhat.

1069
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:49,620
Then you might have to participate in
activities or operations that violate your

1070
01:10:50,021 --> 01:10:52,960
personal moral code such as killing.

1071
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,740
You don't have to be the
person that pulls the trigger.

1072
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,390
You could be a witness or you could
feel that you should have prevented it.

1073
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:06,870
Or You could be in a unit to follows
another unit and you see the innocent

1074
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:12,010
civilians have been killed or you
handle body parts at that time.

1075
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:17,040
You sustain a so called invisible
wounds of war called moral injury.

1076
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,920
It's not a physical wound,
you can't see it.

1077
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:23,790
But in military operations,
we're constantly moving.

1078
01:11:24,120 --> 01:11:26,940
You're going from point
a to point B to point c,

1079
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:31,110
you don't have time to stop and reflect
on this stuff. So what do you do?

1080
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,390
You Bury it and it
becomes unresolved grief,

1081
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:37,883
shame.

1082
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:43,610
And what happens is you come back to
the states and let's say you leave the

1083
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:48,870
military or you're in the national
guard or reserves and you come back to a

1084
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:53,871
community anywhere in the country that
doesn't understand what you've been

1085
01:11:54,511 --> 01:11:58,020
through.
And it boils up to the surface in,

1086
01:11:58,021 --> 01:12:02,550
unless you have a strong coping
mechanism for that, bad stuff happens.

1087
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,600
Anger, guilt, depression, suicide.

1088
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:11,910
And the suicide rate among veterans
today is epidemic. I mean the VA,

1089
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:17,390
it's anywhere from 20 to 22 veterans
per day are dying by suicide and that

1090
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:19,230
frankly is under reported.

1091
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:24,350
It's really higher than that because
you've got veterans who are dying by

1092
01:12:24,781 --> 01:12:27,570
suicide is not reported as a suicide.

1093
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:33,060
They'll drive their motorcycle or a
car into a tree or viaduct and it's a

1094
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:34,830
vehicular accident.

1095
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:40,310
Or unfortunately there's something called
suicide by cop where they forced the

1096
01:12:40,561 --> 01:12:43,830
law enforcement officer
to take lethal action.

1097
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:47,070
And so what's,
what's the implication of all that?

1098
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:52,071
We lose more veterans to suicide in a
year than all the combat does since nine

1099
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:55,200
11.
That's how dramatic it was.

1100
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,440
And we believe that moral injury is a
major contributing factor to that and

1101
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:05,100
military outreach USA,
our organization,

1102
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:10,730
we feel that the main approach to moral
injury is not a medical doctor with

1103
01:13:11,611 --> 01:13:13,020
prescription drugs.

1104
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:18,800
It's the forgiveness and grace have a
moral authority and the counseling of

1105
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:24,411
clergy and sensitive therapist and the
support of a community offering hope and

1106
01:13:26,101 --> 01:13:29,910
help. And so now getting back
that had an incident that,

1107
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:34,320
that you asked me about Jocko, uh,
Allissa, you know, company commander,

1108
01:13:34,321 --> 01:13:35,160
Battle Company,

1109
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:40,190
we'd just overrun a Vietcong position
and killed numerous enemy and I literally

1110
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:45,240
had three dead bodies sent my feet.
Okay.

1111
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,280
While the time a unit is most
vulnerable is right after a victory,

1112
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:55,350
it's just human nature to let your
guard down and breathe a sigh of relief.

1113
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,320
While I'm the guy in charge,
I know that.

1114
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:02,220
So I'm on my radio and I'm
kicking rear end and taking names.

1115
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:06,420
I'm telling my platoon leaders,
reorganize your units,

1116
01:14:06,421 --> 01:14:09,870
be distributed ammunition,
take care of your wounded,

1117
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:13,720
look for enemy avenues of approach
for a counter attack. Right?

1118
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:17,530
And in the middle of all that
stuff going on, I stopped

1119
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:22,180
and I looked at the three
dead bodies at my feet.

1120
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,740
I realized that something
had happened to me.

1121
01:14:27,250 --> 01:14:31,090
Something had hardened my heart.
Only moments earlier,

1122
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:35,320
these were alive human beings.
They had families,

1123
01:14:35,350 --> 01:14:37,720
they had emotions,
they had loved ones,

1124
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,940
they were fighting for something as
important to them as I was fighting for.

1125
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,770
And I was in their backyard.

1126
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:50,050
And then I remembered Jesus's sermon on
the mount where he told us to pray for

1127
01:14:50,051 --> 01:14:54,160
our enemies. So in the midst
of all this stuff going on,

1128
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:57,400
I said a prayer for the three Vietcong.

1129
01:14:57,970 --> 01:15:02,200
And I know I was praying for myself
as much as I was praying for them.

1130
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:07,360
Now you know, I didn't have a big
ceremony, get on my hands and knees,

1131
01:15:07,361 --> 01:15:10,600
any of that stuff, you know, this
is all took about 45 seconds.

1132
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:16,080
But it's something that was seared in my
heart and mind for the rest of my life.

1133
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:21,460
And now that I know about moral injury.
Okay. Which I didn't know at that time.

1134
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:27,180
I realize that I was one in a million who
was able to address my moral injury at

1135
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:33,970
the time that happened. Okay.
And you know, I'd always,

1136
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:35,740
when I came back from Vietnam,

1137
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:39,340
I had seen a lot of my
comrades having nightmares,

1138
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:43,510
having flashbacks, you
know, personality changes.

1139
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:47,290
And I frankly asked myself,
how come I'm not going through that?

1140
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:49,900
Okay.
And at the time,

1141
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:53,710
my answer always was my faith and my wife,

1142
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:59,310
my wonderful wife of now
46 years who is an angel,

1143
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:04,240
I've been so blessed having her for wife.
So that was my answer.

1144
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:05,050
Okay.

1145
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:09,520
But now since I've been
dealing with military outreach
USA and decision of moral

1146
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:13,690
injury, I realized that my
answer was really lacking.

1147
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,120
Okay.
There were two other things.

1148
01:16:16,121 --> 01:16:19,960
One was that incident in Vietnam
that I just mentioned to you.

1149
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:25,290
But the other thing which I now realize
is when I came back from Vietnam,

1150
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:28,030
I joined the reserves.
Okay.

1151
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,780
And I was able to maintain my sense of
purpose of being in a unit with other

1152
01:16:37,691 --> 01:16:42,691
people who shared the same
values that I did of patriotism,

1153
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:45,580
of dedication,
of selfless service,

1154
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,900
which a lot of veterans when they
come back, they just want to cut ties.

1155
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:51,490
Totally innate.

1156
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,520
A lot of them drift because they
don't have that sense of purpose.

1157
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,300
They don't have the camaraderie, they
don't have the bonding. You know,

1158
01:17:01,301 --> 01:17:05,850
I had that with the reservists and
especially, you know, in Viet, you know,

1159
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:10,340
with Vietnam and all the bs that we
had to take from the public. You know,

1160
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:13,220
I mean you won't believe this weight.
Well I know you know this,

1161
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:17,420
but when we came back from Vietnam we
were told not to wear our uniforms in

1162
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:21,360
public. I mean that's how
bad it was. Crazy. You know,

1163
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:26,210
guys wore wigs so they,
people would know they had short haircuts,

1164
01:17:27,130 --> 01:17:30,140
you know, cause they could pick
them up. Is, is being military.

1165
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:35,090
And so my being in the reserves helped me,

1166
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:36,890
you know,
maintain that.

1167
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:43,350
One of the things that I tell guys is
very similar to what you just said.

1168
01:17:43,351 --> 01:17:45,780
You know, I tell guys, you got to
find a new mission when you get done.

1169
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,990
When you get done with the military,
you got to find a new mission.

1170
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,730
And if you can stay in the reserves,
obviously that, that gives you that.

1171
01:17:50,731 --> 01:17:53,820
But if you don't do that well then you
got to find what are you going to do?

1172
01:17:53,821 --> 01:17:56,730
What are you going to step out there?
Are you going to become a great dad?

1173
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,930
Are you going to build a business?

1174
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:00,390
Are you going to work for a
company and do a great job?

1175
01:18:00,391 --> 01:18:04,620
Or you got to find a new mission. And I
f I find that guys that I've seen that,

1176
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:08,070
that have real problems, it's because
they got out and they didn't know,

1177
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:09,510
they didn't have any direction to go into.

1178
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,600
And also what does the
dig a little bit deeper.

1179
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:17,480
So you're in that situation
where you see these guys and,

1180
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,470
and,
and for the first time you,

1181
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,190
you kind of look down on them
and see them as people, as,

1182
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:27,600
as other human beings. Is it, you know,

1183
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:29,610
is it the fact that you,
when you,

1184
01:18:29,611 --> 01:18:33,000
when you said a prayer
for them and for yourself,

1185
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:38,330
I kind of got an a thought of when you
hear about like native Americans hunting

1186
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:43,890
and you know, they, they think, you
know, when, when they get a kill they'll,

1187
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,440
they'll thank, you
know, Mother Nature and,

1188
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:51,030
and thank for the sacrifice was at
that type of thing where you said,

1189
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:55,020
okay, you know what, we're
fighting. I was doing my job.

1190
01:18:55,080 --> 01:19:00,080
You guys were doing your job
and I hope you have peace now.

1191
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:01,800
It was,
it was at that type of thing.

1192
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:06,780
Absolutely. Because you
know, what happens is

1193
01:19:08,670 --> 01:19:13,440
you forget that they're,
they're dehumanized, right?
You know, you've got all these,

1194
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:17,400
all these names that you call them,
you know,

1195
01:19:17,401 --> 01:19:22,380
but I've really respected the VC,
our enemy,

1196
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:23,970
you know, and that's, uh,
that's the other thing.

1197
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:26,970
You can't underestimate your enemy.

1198
01:19:27,510 --> 01:19:31,410
You always have to respect them.
You have, you know, I mean,

1199
01:19:31,411 --> 01:19:33,990
you don't have to agree
with them, but you, you,

1200
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:36,750
you have to respect their abilities.

1201
01:19:36,751 --> 01:19:41,580
Because once you lose track of that,
you can really get screwed.

1202
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:45,390
And basically, uh, I'll,
I'll give you some examples.

1203
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:50,130
When we had that battle on 22 may,
okay, I was in the CNC helicopter with,

1204
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:54,660
and I guess I should describe that battle
a little bit more. Cigarette listeners.

1205
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:56,420
We're, we're talking about, uh,

1206
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,170
the hardcore battalion and when
we surround this, this, this VC,

1207
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:05,440
uh, training battalion, you really
is what it was and we annihilated it.

1208
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:06,400
Basically they were,

1209
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:11,100
they in circled and we were
just calling in air strikes,

1210
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,440
naval gunfire,
you know,

1211
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:18,240
we were just taking then Hackworth
had them totally in circle.

1212
01:20:18,690 --> 01:20:23,520
And so I'll never forget, I was in the
helicopter with him and he basically said,

1213
01:20:23,521 --> 01:20:26,170
move. Uh, we got, uh,

1214
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:31,050
first we get a radio message from one
of our companies who might've been alert

1215
01:20:31,051 --> 01:20:34,890
company and they said, we just had a
contact, you know, we killed three,

1216
01:20:34,891 --> 01:20:36,810
we've can't, you know,
we got four weapons,

1217
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:41,130
we captured a guy or whatever and
they're headed in this direction. Okay.

1218
01:20:41,550 --> 01:20:45,120
So hackers with turned to me and
say, look, you know, let's say,

1219
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:48,150
give him 15 minutes,
we're going to hear from battle company.

1220
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,790
15 minutes later, battle company comes
up, we just had her contact, you know,

1221
01:20:53,791 --> 01:20:58,500
and they were headed. And so this
happened all day. Okay, I saw this,

1222
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:03,390
I was with them then the helicopter and,
but there was one VC,

1223
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:06,870
we were flying near a canal
and he was mortally wounded.

1224
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:09,360
You could see the guy was dying,
basically.

1225
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:14,780
He took his Ak 47 and he
threw it into the canal.

1226
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,003
Okay.

1227
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:22,190
And the reason he did that is he didn't
want us to get that weapon because part

1228
01:21:23,911 --> 01:21:26,140
of the body count,
uh,

1229
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:30,010
was you matched how many weapons you,
you know what I mean?

1230
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:33,660
If a unit B port and they said, well,
we killed 20 and we got one weapon,

1231
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:36,960
you kind of say, wait a second. You know,

1232
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:41,130
so when I saw that I knew that this guy,
you know,

1233
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:45,810
we were up against a tough
enemy, you know, and and uh,

1234
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:49,380
so,
so you got to respect your enemy and

1235
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:54,780
I want to pull some,
before we move past a Vietnam and hack,

1236
01:21:54,781 --> 01:21:59,160
I want to pull some stuff out of about
face just to kind of hear you hear your,

1237
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:00,510
your thoughts on it.

1238
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:05,100
I'm going to start off with one that
you've talked about a little bit,

1239
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:05,761
but here we go.

1240
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:10,761
This is from about face by David Hackworth
and this is a quote from someone else

1241
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:15,210
says hack had the knack of being
able to size people up very quickly,

1242
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:20,190
almost instantaneously.
And I'd say 99% of the time he was right.

1243
01:22:20,370 --> 01:22:24,930
He could look at a person and in his
vernacular the guy was either a stud or he

1244
01:22:24,931 --> 01:22:26,790
wasn't,
there was no in between.

1245
01:22:27,690 --> 01:22:30,780
If he was a stud hack would
find a way to get him.

1246
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:36,360
And he would not take no from people
if you wanted them because he wanted a

1247
01:22:36,361 --> 01:22:40,260
winning team. And if a person
didn't want to go with him,

1248
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,890
then immediately the guy wasn't a stud,
you see,

1249
01:22:44,190 --> 01:22:49,190
because anybody who knew hack or came
into contact with him really wanted to be

1250
01:22:49,351 --> 01:22:51,870
with him after he'd known him for a while.

1251
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:56,930
And that's a quote from Brigadier
General James H Uchiyama,

1252
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,103
which is you,

1253
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,920
you're quoted in the book
and you've talked about that
a little bit and he just,

1254
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,190
he must have had extremely

1255
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,880
magnetic personality for you to say
that if you spent time with him,

1256
01:23:08,881 --> 01:23:11,620
you wanted to be with him.
Oh, absolutely. And, and he,

1257
01:23:12,160 --> 01:23:16,570
I used to say he had the midas touch.
Everything that guy touched,

1258
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,070
just whether it was in the military,
whether it was in business,

1259
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:25,210
whether it was with women.
I mean, this guy, you know,

1260
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:29,260
he was a stud of himself and, uh,
and, you know, and, but he was,

1261
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:34,320
he was also a sensitive guy.
I'll never forget when, uh,

1262
01:23:35,070 --> 01:23:39,710
you know, I tell people he wasn't
the most moral guy that I knew. Uh,

1263
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,160
but he was the,

1264
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:45,820
the most ethical officer
I ever served with.

1265
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:50,850
What I mean by that is he never
did anything for personal gain.

1266
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:56,230
Uh, he always did things for the
unit and for the soldiers. Okay.

1267
01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:00,470
But did he have affairs and things like
that? Yeah, and he used to tell me,

1268
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,960
he said, Moocs, you know,

1269
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:06,961
I should've never married
because my love is the army,

1270
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:12,130
you know, so he, he basically,
he turned down the war college.

1271
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,610
He could have gone to the workout. He
turned it down because he said, hey,

1272
01:24:15,611 --> 01:24:20,010
I'm on another battalion in
Vietnam. You know, I mean,

1273
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:23,410
he would have been a journal.
There's no question about it. Uh,

1274
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:28,120
had had he not stood off, you know,
when he was no. Six and, and uh,

1275
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,920
and you know, he, I think he was the
youngest oh six at that time in the army.

1276
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:37,310
But he was a guy who, who was, uh,

1277
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,560
he was sensitive though, and he took care.
He did take care of his family effect.

1278
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:44,050
I can say this now because it's,
you know,

1279
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:47,350
I think statute of limitations
might be gone, but you know,

1280
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:51,100
in those days you weren't,
you were enabled to take a
lot of cash out of Vietnam,

1281
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:54,760
you know, and uh, and I basically,

1282
01:24:54,761 --> 01:24:58,180
one day he knew I was going
back home. Oh. And by the way,

1283
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:03,390
he did everything he could to convince
me to stay to extend in Vietnam.

1284
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:06,400
Okay. He was, he had moved down to be the,

1285
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:11,350
the senior advisor for the
Arvin airborne division,

1286
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:14,720
which is really the palace
guard around Saigon. Okay.

1287
01:25:15,340 --> 01:25:17,860
And he knew all my hot buttons.
You have to understand,

1288
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:22,810
I was a bachelor guy at this
time, right. And, and uh,

1289
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:28,240
and the Arab board, the Vietnamese
airborne war, a special fatigues.

1290
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:32,500
They were like tiger fatigue and
they had red berets, you know,

1291
01:25:32,501 --> 01:25:37,100
and I'm just this young stud guy who
likes uniforms. And he said, look,

1292
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,930
he said,

1293
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:42,850
why don't you come down here and
I'll make you the g one advisor.

1294
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:46,930
That's the Admin Guy, right? And
he said, but when you come down,

1295
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:51,390
if you're an advisor for the Vietnamese
airborne, you get jumped, pay, you don't.

1296
01:25:51,391 --> 01:25:54,970
So that's extra money.
Right. And, and he said,

1297
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,900
and I'll give you two are in ours.

1298
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:03,620
Cause he knew I wanted to go to Japan
and see my relatives. So six months,

1299
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:07,370
he started giving you a two hour
now. Right. So the guys, you know,

1300
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,710
he's trying to move the, you
know, the sun and the moon.

1301
01:26:09,711 --> 01:26:14,660
They get me new extent six months
then. And I said, sir, I appreciate it,

1302
01:26:14,661 --> 01:26:19,520
but I had some close calls and I figured
the next one would have muckle yama

1303
01:26:19,521 --> 01:26:24,170
written. Yeah. Bullet, what happened? Walk
me home a written none. And I said, uh,

1304
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:27,710
no thanks. I appreciate it,
but I'm, I'm Outta here. So,

1305
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,440
so I left,
you know,

1306
01:26:29,441 --> 01:26:33,640
you're talking about the way he was,

1307
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,680
you know,
so,

1308
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:40,740
so pro army and yet he rebelled
against the army in away and here,

1309
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:44,080
here's a,
another thing from the book.

1310
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:45,770
Okay.

1311
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:46,430
He says,

1312
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:51,430
what a mistake it was to listen to the
generals of corporate HQ who were briefed

1313
01:26:52,041 --> 01:26:54,260
only in zero defect terms.

1314
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,060
And so far from the cutting
edge expected nothing less.

1315
01:26:59,690 --> 01:27:02,270
It was amongst the biggest
mistakes of the war.

1316
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:07,480
The politicians only listened to these
generals and the generals only listened

1317
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:13,370
to themselves.
Few people asked frontline soldiers,

1318
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:16,340
the only ones who really knew.

1319
01:27:19,530 --> 01:27:22,740
Could you guys or could you,
cause you were pretty close to him.

1320
01:27:22,741 --> 01:27:26,790
Could you sense that his
frustration with the army,

1321
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:30,750
did he talk about it with you? Did
he, how did he treat, you know,

1322
01:27:30,751 --> 01:27:33,720
that's a very hard thing for
a, for a leader to do. If your,

1323
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,170
if your senior leadership is telling you
to do stuff that doesn't make sense or,

1324
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:40,650
but you know, hey, we can get it
done and we're going to do it.

1325
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,920
It's a hard line to walk to say,
look, we support the chain of command.

1326
01:27:43,921 --> 01:27:46,080
This is what they're telling us to do.
I'm going to spin it in a positive way.

1327
01:27:46,081 --> 01:27:47,940
Everyone's going to think that we're
doing it for the right reasons.

1328
01:27:47,941 --> 01:27:51,030
Because if I say, hey look Merk,
here's what I want you to do and it's,

1329
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,840
it's dumb but we're getting told to do it
anyways. That's not a good way to lead.

1330
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:59,240
No. So he wouldn't say that. So he would,
he would support the chain and, yeah,

1331
01:27:59,290 --> 01:28:04,000
and he, he would, he
would present it in a,

1332
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,090
in a way in which,
you know,

1333
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:12,640
would talk about the nation and he would
make sure that he would accomplish the

1334
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:18,140
mission, but he would
do it his way, you know,

1335
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:22,300
and you know the phrase battlefield
expediency, that's so we did all the time,

1336
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,910
you know, I mean, screw it. What,
you know, what are they going to do?

1337
01:28:24,911 --> 01:28:29,140
Send us to Vietnam. We were already
there, you know, so, you know,

1338
01:28:29,141 --> 01:28:32,290
we just did what we had to
do and you know, I mean,

1339
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,470
the stupid rules of engagement
that we had, you know,

1340
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:40,330
where you'd have to get approval to fire
on people even though you're receiving

1341
01:28:40,331 --> 01:28:45,040
fire, you know, and, and just nutty
stuff. Right. You know, and we just say,

1342
01:28:45,041 --> 01:28:48,580
hey, you know, we're going to do what
we have to do. And that's what we did.

1343
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:49,853
[inaudible].

1344
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:56,040
Here's when he, uh, when he took
over the battalion the following day,

1345
01:28:56,041 --> 01:28:58,320
I took over the battalion from
Lieutenant Colonel Franklin,

1346
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:02,910
a heart in a parade field exchange of,
in the middle of the Mekong Delta.

1347
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,820
What kind of war have I gotten
myself into? I wondered,

1348
01:29:06,360 --> 01:29:08,610
a perfectly starch
General Ewell was there,

1349
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,730
having flown in for the occasion
in his polished choppers.

1350
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:15,000
There was other brass too, and
photographers, the American flag,

1351
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:15,960
the battalion colors,

1352
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:20,020
which were ceremoniously passed on to
me and all of this before the scrounge,

1353
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:23,460
easiest, most spiritless assembly
of soldiers I'd ever seen.

1354
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:25,230
Incredibly,

1355
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:30,320
none of the generals or Kernels seem
to notice the slack condition of my new

1356
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:35,460
charges or their positions.
From the outset,

1357
01:29:35,461 --> 01:29:38,520
I realized that to make this unit
effective military force that have to

1358
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:43,080
implement about a thousand changes,
so I figured we'd start with five a day.

1359
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:43,950
Little things,

1360
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:47,340
basic things like where your steel pot
and cleaned and carry your rifle at all

1361
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:50,760
times and ammunition will not be worn.
Poncho via style.

1362
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,140
My for first order was that
darkness that come darkness.

1363
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:58,080
The fire support base perimeter
would pull back 300 meters.

1364
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,470
The troops instantly began
to grumble about this,

1365
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,090
but it was the next order that really
began the muteness feeling within my hard

1366
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:10,820
luck outfit. Anything you can't carry 24
hours a day is gone in the next chopper,

1367
01:30:10,950 --> 01:30:11,670
chopper,

1368
01:30:11,670 --> 01:30:16,670
good buy tents and cots and rucksacks and
food Docker's the bitching and moaning

1369
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:22,101
begin in earnest as piles and piles of
junk mounted at the Lz to be whisked away

1370
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:24,480
by Chinuch.
But I didn't care.

1371
01:30:24,990 --> 01:30:27,180
I wasn't there to have them like me.

1372
01:30:30,510 --> 01:30:35,180
Again, we, we already
talked about this and I,

1373
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:39,480
this comes up a lot from a
leadership perspective. Do you,

1374
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:42,990
is it more important to be liked or
is it more important to be respected?

1375
01:30:42,991 --> 01:30:44,070
Is it more important to,

1376
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:46,410
and I actually had a guy asked
me this question the other day,

1377
01:30:46,411 --> 01:30:50,970
is it more important
to win or to be liked?

1378
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:56,340
And I said, well, those two things
aren't mutually exclusive at all. Right?

1379
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,250
You're absolutely correct.
And they're not mutually exclusive.

1380
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:01,973
You know,

1381
01:31:02,830 --> 01:31:07,830
if you demonstrate to your soldiers
that you care for them professionally,

1382
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:10,660
that's you'll be liked.

1383
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:16,290
There's no question because they know
that you're there for them and you know,

1384
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:19,540
you don't, as as it said there, you know,

1385
01:31:19,541 --> 01:31:22,810
you're not there to win a
popularity contest. You know,

1386
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,760
you're not there to be
politically correct.

1387
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:27,820
You're there to accomplish your mission,

1388
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:31,000
but also make sure that
your guys come back.

1389
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:34,650
And I think I'm, I'm
starting to tie together, um,

1390
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:38,360
but something very clearly in my head
right now. And that is, you know, your,

1391
01:31:38,361 --> 01:31:42,110
your number two rule of leadership,
which is caring.

1392
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,320
And I think if you,

1393
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,440
if you care about your people and
they see that you care about them,

1394
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:52,550
that trumps the fact that you want
them to do things the right way.

1395
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,740
Because the reason you want him to do the
things the right way is cause you care

1396
01:31:54,741 --> 01:31:58,550
about them and it's going to keep
them alive. They make you successful.

1397
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:03,460
Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely. Uh, you know, I,

1398
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:05,800
when I was a young officer,
I,

1399
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,130
okay,

1400
01:32:07,130 --> 01:32:10,940
well no, I, at that time when I was a
company, can we, after Hackworth left,

1401
01:32:10,941 --> 01:32:14,240
we had another battalion
commander come in, right?

1402
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:19,040
And he wrote on my OER all my career,

1403
01:32:19,041 --> 01:32:22,820
I had Max OERs, really good stuff. But um,

1404
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:24,200
and this one,

1405
01:32:24,201 --> 01:32:29,201
he wrote that and I'll take
this hit any day of the week.

1406
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:34,100
He said I was too concerned
or my troops sometimes.

1407
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:39,350
Wow. And uh, and I said,
okay, I'll take that.

1408
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:45,180
Wow. That's interesting perspective. Yeah.

1409
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:49,230
And you know,
this is one of those dichotomies as well.

1410
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:50,770
Okay.

1411
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:54,610
Because one of the hardest things about
being a leader is obviously you care

1412
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:57,760
about your men so much and yet
you are going to do things.

1413
01:32:57,761 --> 01:33:00,550
You are going to put them in situations
that they're going to put their lives at

1414
01:33:00,551 --> 01:33:02,800
risks at risk.
And that is,

1415
01:33:02,801 --> 01:33:06,880
that is something that every leader has
to release military leaders to have to,

1416
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:08,310
okay.

1417
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:12,900
They have to find a way to get a handle
on that because you love your guys and

1418
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,280
you want to take care of them, but you do
have to do your mission. Yep. And that,

1419
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:20,460
that's one of the hardest
things to balance.

1420
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:28,720
Talking about the morality of war a
little bit. This was a, and again,

1421
01:33:28,721 --> 01:33:31,600
this is why you know that the
story that I opened up with,

1422
01:33:31,601 --> 01:33:34,630
you could see that that one
clearly had to do with with,

1423
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:36,200
okay,

1424
01:33:36,200 --> 01:33:40,880
having moral dilemmas and having guilt
because Hackworth gave a guy in order and

1425
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:44,300
the guy followed the order.
Maybe not the way Hackworth 40 was,

1426
01:33:44,301 --> 01:33:48,560
but the moral injury that he got from
that he said lasted his whole life of

1427
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:51,110
giving an order and somebody
does something and you
didn't expect to do them.

1428
01:33:51,111 --> 01:33:52,400
They end up getting killed.

1429
01:33:52,450 --> 01:33:56,840
It's one of his guys when his guys that
he loved gets killed because of the way

1430
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:57,703
he led.

1431
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:04,010
Here's another kind of moral situation.
Going back to the book.

1432
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:10,660
They're flying around. They're on a
mission. We went down to about 100 feet.

1433
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:12,490
The suspects were still running,

1434
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:15,730
but this closer inspection
confirmed my initial feeling.

1435
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:18,070
They were just eight kids,

1436
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:23,430
no older than 13 or 14 simply
scared shitless as they ran.

1437
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:27,100
Looking for cover, caring, neither
weapons nor military equipment.

1438
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:31,830
No, I told the pilot, I don't
give you permission to fire.

1439
01:34:32,010 --> 01:34:34,020
I'll put an infantry insert on them.

1440
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:38,870
I instructed the platoon leader whose
men were aboard the four slicks.

1441
01:34:38,900 --> 01:34:39,733
Where to land.

1442
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:41,030
Yeah.

1443
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:43,910
With gun ships covering the platoon,
hit the ground.

1444
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:48,890
The immediately received small arms
fire and took a couple of wounded.

1445
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:50,000
Okay.

1446
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,770
The little kids were, as my savvy pilot
had said from the outset, Vietcong,

1447
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:56,390
yeah.

1448
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,250
It was a major learned for me,

1449
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:01,040
but one impossible to etch in stone.

1450
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:06,500
I had a couple of men wounded who would
not have been if I just said to blow

1451
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:07,340
those kids away,

1452
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:12,850
but I couldn't say blow him away
because they appeared on armed. Yes,

1453
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:13,930
they were VC,

1454
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:18,730
but they could just as well have been
kids ditching school who happened to get

1455
01:35:18,731 --> 01:35:19,840
caught in the crossfire.

1456
01:35:20,860 --> 01:35:25,030
Anything was possible and I suddenly
realized it would not be easy.

1457
01:35:25,031 --> 01:35:26,080
This delta war,

1458
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:30,490
it wasn't easy to tell the good guys from
the bad guys anywhere in South Vietnam,

1459
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:34,270
but here in the delta it
was damn near impossible.

1460
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:39,273
Okay.

1461
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:39,591
Again,

1462
01:35:39,591 --> 01:35:44,591
very similar to what my guys dealt with
over in Ramadi was very hard to tell who

1463
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:48,450
was good and who was bad and the
enemy knew they could just put the,

1464
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:50,340
drop the weapon and walk away.

1465
01:35:50,341 --> 01:35:54,300
And now they were considered innocent
even though 20 seconds prior to that they

1466
01:35:54,301 --> 01:35:55,134
were shooting.

1467
01:35:57,030 --> 01:36:02,030
How did you keep your men from becoming
so callous that they were just going to

1468
01:36:04,740 --> 01:36:08,160
start shooting kids because
they suspected they were VC?

1469
01:36:08,161 --> 01:36:10,440
How hard did you have
to keep control of that?

1470
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:12,893
Well,
I,

1471
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:18,200
my response to that is the American
soldier innately is ethical.

1472
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:25,350
It's, it's in our culture not
to shoot women and children.

1473
01:36:27,180 --> 01:36:31,440
Now guys, you know, if
there were, you know,

1474
01:36:31,470 --> 01:36:36,090
that that might be
something else, but, uh, we,

1475
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:37,740
and we do not

1476
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:44,400
shoot civilians. Just, you
know, who are, who are,

1477
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:48,920
are, uh, were caught with, you know, we,

1478
01:36:48,921 --> 01:36:53,700
we run across them just because they're
there and we want to take revenge.

1479
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:57,000
We don't do that as an army.
Yeah. Generally speaking.

1480
01:36:57,001 --> 01:37:01,930
Now there are times when people lose it.
And I understand that that's,

1481
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:05,460
that's the stress of war and
it's happened in all wars.

1482
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:10,810
I don't condone it, but
I can understand. Uh,

1483
01:37:11,250 --> 01:37:13,620
and so to answer your question,

1484
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:19,100
we really didn't have to our guys who
are pretty professional and I was proud,

1485
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:24,750
proud to serve with them. I didn't,
they didn't, I didn't see any of that.

1486
01:37:25,290 --> 01:37:25,800
Okay.

1487
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:28,980
Yeah. And this, this just tells me,
once again it's about leadership.

1488
01:37:29,310 --> 01:37:33,270
I mean cause here you can see hack
clearly leaning towards making sure he's

1489
01:37:33,271 --> 01:37:34,380
doing the right thing,

1490
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,560
even though he's a guy that loves his
troops and wants to take care of him,

1491
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:41,070
he's still leans towards doing the right
thing. And from what you're saying,

1492
01:37:41,071 --> 01:37:43,320
that filtered all the way through
the chain of command. And we,

1493
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:44,760
we took an in depth look,

1494
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:49,780
I've actually done two podcasts
concerning the mee Lai massacre and what

1495
01:37:50,521 --> 01:37:51,091
happened there.

1496
01:37:51,091 --> 01:37:56,091
And it was just so clear
that the leadership was
completely fault and the way

1497
01:37:56,251 --> 01:37:57,300
that they lead those troops,

1498
01:37:57,301 --> 01:38:02,301
and it was when I went through to try
and pull something positive out of the

1499
01:38:02,551 --> 01:38:02,781
meal,

1500
01:38:02,781 --> 01:38:07,781
I massacre the positive message that
I got from it was that it was one,

1501
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:12,510
it was one officer who had flown, he
was Thompson, I believe his name was,

1502
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:15,600
but he'd flown over, he'd seen what
was happening. He flew back to base,

1503
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:18,600
told the senior leadership,
this is what's going on in the ground.

1504
01:38:18,900 --> 01:38:22,200
The senior leadership radioed into the
field and say, stop killing people.

1505
01:38:22,650 --> 01:38:25,500
And the,
they literally instantly stopped.

1506
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,980
They stopped the masker just because
a leader stepped up and said, stop.

1507
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:34,530
So good leadership completely changed
the situation as it was ongoing.

1508
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:35,550
And,
and clearly,

1509
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:38,160
if there would've been a better leader
on the ground that was leading in the

1510
01:38:38,161 --> 01:38:40,530
right way,
it never would have even started.

1511
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:43,800
So you can see here
from what hacks saying,

1512
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:48,590
the way he led and the way
he treated unknown, you know,

1513
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:52,260
people. And then the way that was
carried out through the whole battalion.

1514
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,890
That's another amazing
testament to good leadership.

1515
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,830
Yeah. And, and one thing about me lie,

1516
01:38:58,890 --> 01:39:03,890
which I tell people is that it was the
exception approved the rule that United

1517
01:39:05,790 --> 01:39:10,400
States military, that that was
an exception. Oh yeah. Yup.

1518
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:15,030
You know, the, the rule in our
military is we don't, we don't do that.

1519
01:39:15,660 --> 01:39:19,500
And that proved it. I mean,
I, I didn't see, you know,

1520
01:39:19,501 --> 01:39:23,910
there were other armies there
who were more ruthless, like the,

1521
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:28,410
like the Rock, the rocks were
not there. The Republic of Korea,

1522
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:31,380
they were not there. The win, the
hearts and minds of the people,

1523
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,540
they were there to win the war.

1524
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:38,130
So if they would go buy a
village and they were fired upon,

1525
01:39:38,250 --> 01:39:42,810
they'd destroy the village.
And after a while,

1526
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:44,340
nobody fired on the rocks.

1527
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:52,570
When Hackworth now gets,
well,

1528
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:54,290
he got wounded in eighth time.

1529
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:59,380
Yeah. I thought you were getting to
that when you read that one quote.

1530
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:02,740
But the way now,
I wasn't there with him when he,

1531
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:07,700
when he got his eighth purple
heart. Uh, but I know the story and,

1532
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:11,780
and basically there were guys who were in,

1533
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:16,000
in bad shape and he lands
his CNC in the middle of the,

1534
01:40:16,001 --> 01:40:18,440
in fact that might have been
there and maybe you didn't,

1535
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:22,480
they landed it in the middle
of a firefight or hacked did.

1536
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:28,500
He ordered the pilot that take them down
and he does put the wound to guys into

1537
01:40:28,730 --> 01:40:33,070
the CNC. Well the CNC isn't that big.
You know, there's no room for Hec.

1538
01:40:33,370 --> 01:40:37,840
So he stands on the skits and they
take off and he gets it in the lake.

1539
01:40:38,470 --> 01:40:41,740
And that was his, a purple
heart. Well after that, you know,

1540
01:40:41,741 --> 01:40:43,500
he could tell the guys in the battalion,

1541
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:46,570
I want you to walk through this wall
of fire. And the response would be,

1542
01:40:46,571 --> 01:40:51,490
where do you want us to go? You
know, he, he led by example.

1543
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:57,760
Is that what caused the army? You say,
okay, we're gonna did they pull it?

1544
01:40:57,761 --> 01:41:00,150
Did they pull them from the battalion
at that point when he got his eighth

1545
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:03,070
portfolio? Pretty much that was,
that was it. Cause what was,

1546
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,580
if you got three purple hearts, you
went home. Was that, was that the deal?

1547
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:08,950
I only had one,
but I have no idea.

1548
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:15,010
They basically said, you know, we
can't afford to lose you and if they,

1549
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,630
you know,
if you get killed,

1550
01:41:16,631 --> 01:41:21,100
I mean that's a vague kit and
just the morale and you know,

1551
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:25,450
and so you're Outta, you're
outta there in the field. Okay.

1552
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,070
So he went up to play
coup to become the deputy.

1553
01:41:30,130 --> 01:41:34,540
He was the GC three core
advisor for two core. Okay.

1554
01:41:34,541 --> 01:41:36,100
Which was the central highlands.

1555
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:41,460
And when my company was pulled out of
Vietnam, be few Sicko, I said, hey,

1556
01:41:41,461 --> 01:41:45,940
I want to stay here. I called half
and I said, sir, you know, I don't,

1557
01:41:45,941 --> 01:41:48,210
I don't really want to go back.
Can you use me?

1558
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:51,830
I had orders the next day to go to flake.
Who,

1559
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:54,900
and then you went up to
play. Cool. And you start,

1560
01:41:55,170 --> 01:41:59,640
you guys were doing advising for
the Marvin? Yes, we, we were the,

1561
01:41:59,670 --> 01:42:03,410
we were the Mac v that's a
military assistance command,

1562
01:42:03,411 --> 01:42:08,210
Vietnam people. And, uh, I had, uh,

1563
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:13,880
there was a close call that I had when,
uh,

1564
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:17,240
this was another moral
injury thing by the way,

1565
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:22,850
which I really had really buried,
had not really thought a lot about it,

1566
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,890
but we,

1567
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:29,920
we had an inspection team that went
out on the special forces camps on the

1568
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:35,520
border of Cambodia and Laos and Vietnam.
And you had pleasuring,

1569
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:39,830
Ben had docto, uh, in
the central highlands.

1570
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:44,970
And so we would fly into
these camps. And, uh,

1571
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:48,290
there were three people on this
inspection team, so to speak.

1572
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:53,210
It was the deputy corps advisor who
was an o six, a full colonel, you know,

1573
01:42:53,211 --> 01:42:57,680
big deal. There was the command sergeant,
major, highest ranking enlisted,

1574
01:42:58,370 --> 01:43:03,110
uh, advisor, also a big deal. And
I was the young captain, okay.

1575
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:06,890
Carrying everything, but he's
bags and note takers, right? So,

1576
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:09,310
so we land on this special forces,
this camp,

1577
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:15,220
and we come under attack and
the sergeant major is killed.

1578
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:20,920
And he was maybe 20 meters away from
me and was a rocket. And it was just,

1579
01:43:21,490 --> 01:43:25,930
he was in the wrong place. You know, it
could have been me if I was, you know,

1580
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:29,200
if had to come in the other direction.
Well,

1581
01:43:29,201 --> 01:43:34,201
the backside of that story is that he was
scheduled to go on rnr the next day to

1582
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:42,121
Hawaii to meet his waiting wife to
celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary.

1583
01:43:46,030 --> 01:43:50,560
Okay.
Now I wish I was just a young captain,

1584
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:55,430
but I outranked him. Okay. I could
have ordered him not to go on

1585
01:43:57,020 --> 01:44:00,320
that mission. Why risk
it, you know, cause he,

1586
01:44:00,490 --> 01:44:05,180
he was going to meet his wife the
next day. I didn't do that. Okay.

1587
01:44:05,660 --> 01:44:06,230
And I,

1588
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:10,940
I've thought about that in terms of
survivor guilt and in all of that,

1589
01:44:11,750 --> 01:44:15,950
uh, it was, uh, uh, and that's
something that's come up in my,

1590
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,980
you know,
my studying this moral injury stuff

1591
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:24,530
at this point. Did you, you're,

1592
01:44:24,900 --> 01:44:29,900
so now you're working with Hackworth
directly and are you starting to sense his

1593
01:44:29,971 --> 01:44:34,350
frustration about the war at all?

1594
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:39,850
Yeah, a little bit. Uh, yet, well, no,
more than a little bit because the,

1595
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:40,713
the,

1596
01:44:41,700 --> 01:44:41,950
the

1597
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:46,030
g three for the core was a fairly corrupt,

1598
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:50,440
a guy and a Hackworth was
very frustrated with that.

1599
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:56,020
And, uh, that's why he left actually. Uh,

1600
01:44:56,830 --> 01:45:00,250
well let's backtrack. I, I, uh, yeah, he,

1601
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,890
he was moved down to
the Vietnamese airborne

1602
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:08,210
cause he really was not happy.
I think he might've been moved.

1603
01:45:08,930 --> 01:45:12,410
I never really got the story on that,
why he went down there.

1604
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:15,410
And now at this point,
what's your,

1605
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,320
what are you thinking about
your career in your life?

1606
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:21,520
I'd already decided I was
resigning when I got back

1607
01:45:21,860 --> 01:45:25,310
to the states. And what made you,
what made you lean in that direction?

1608
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:26,210
Because I mean,

1609
01:45:26,330 --> 01:45:31,330
you did more years in JRTC than
anyone has ever done before.

1610
01:45:31,860 --> 01:45:32,301
And did,
you,

1611
01:45:32,301 --> 01:45:36,140
did ROTC and you had all that military
stuff and now you've got your combat tour

1612
01:45:36,141 --> 01:45:40,010
in Vietnam. Under what, what, what
tilted you and the other direction?

1613
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:45,180
Uh, I felt the army was going in
the wrong direction when it came to

1614
01:45:46,710 --> 01:45:47,543
leadership.

1615
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:52,640
I thought that they were looking
for managers and not commanders.

1616
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,360
Uh,
I was in some positions during my career.

1617
01:45:57,361 --> 01:45:59,690
I had access to,
uh,

1618
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:04,730
officer efficiency reports and I could
see where the ratings of the senior

1619
01:46:07,291 --> 01:46:11,790
officers, that lieutenant colonels
and the battalion commanders were.

1620
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,860
The tendency was to give the
managers high ratings, uh, Irri

1621
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:23,130
irrespective of their
command and abilities.

1622
01:46:23,940 --> 01:46:28,290
And then my personal career was,
was not managed very well.

1623
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:33,420
Uh, Hackworth, Hackworth wanted
me to stay. He knew I was,

1624
01:46:33,540 --> 01:46:37,080
I was thinking of resigning and the neck.
That's why he offered me the company,

1625
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:41,430
cause you know, he thought that experience
might turn things around, you know.

1626
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:46,170
And so I'm here I am at still with
Hackworth in the battalion. Right.

1627
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:51,300
And he contacted his friends at
the, and he said, listen you guys,

1628
01:46:51,301 --> 01:46:55,320
we got a stud here and he's
thinking of leaving, you know,

1629
01:46:55,321 --> 01:46:59,730
show him some personal attention. We
got a chance to save him. You know,

1630
01:46:59,731 --> 01:47:04,480
he told me this later. So I get this
letter from the Pentagon, you know what,

1631
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:06,630
I'm out in the middle of nowhere,
you know,

1632
01:47:06,900 --> 01:47:11,820
and I first letter they had ever sent me
and they said, dear captain McCall, yum.

1633
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,680
We have reviewed your two
oh one file very carefully.

1634
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:17,670
Right.

1635
01:47:17,670 --> 01:47:22,670
And we believe you have
promised for graduate school.

1636
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:27,120
Okay.
Only problem is I already had my masters,

1637
01:47:28,230 --> 01:47:31,820
which means that they didn't really pay
a lot of tension right there would be

1638
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:36,330
view. I, I showed the letter to hack and I
said, hey, you know, I mean this is crazy.

1639
01:47:36,331 --> 01:47:39,900
Yo, I'm going to put my career in
the hands of these guys, you know?

1640
01:47:40,050 --> 01:47:43,200
And that pretty well sealed it for me.
And so did you,

1641
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:47,160
did you submit your resignation while you
were still in Vietnam or to come home?

1642
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:51,660
As soon as I came home I did. I wanted to
finish the tour in Vietnam, which I did.

1643
01:47:52,170 --> 01:47:56,640
And then I told the army, um,
I'm going to be Outta here,

1644
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:01,230
you know? And so they assigned me
to Fort Sheridan, Illinois. Right.

1645
01:48:01,410 --> 01:48:03,990
Cause I lived in Chicago and I finished,

1646
01:48:03,991 --> 01:48:06,810
I have three months there
and then I was done.

1647
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:09,360
And then did you,

1648
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:12,600
at what point did you decide
you were gonna stay in the
reserves? Oh, immediately.

1649
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:16,230
That was never a question
I was committed to doing.

1650
01:48:16,231 --> 01:48:20,100
20 years turned out to
be 32, but I, you know,

1651
01:48:20,101 --> 01:48:24,900
I was committed to doing 20 because
especially at that time in 70,

1652
01:48:24,901 --> 01:48:25,860
71,

1653
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:30,540
the reserve components didn't have
a lot of combat experienced guys.

1654
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:36,350
And I felt that it was
important that I try to help,

1655
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,980
you know, the reserves
be ready basically. Uh,

1656
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:45,480
and I had something to contribute.
So that's why I joined the reserves.

1657
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:50,160
And then you start on your
civilian career. Yeah. Yeah.

1658
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,290
And what happened there was I,

1659
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:57,540
I worked for a Japanese importing
and exporting company. Uh,

1660
01:48:57,750 --> 01:49:01,920
it's called a trading company and it
was a name of the company was Mitsui and

1661
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:02,970
it's world.

1662
01:49:02,971 --> 01:49:07,971
We know we used to have a saying that
the sun never set on Mitsui because they

1663
01:49:08,401 --> 01:49:11,880
had offices in like 165 countries.
Okay.

1664
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:16,260
And it was a very prestigious company.
If anybody,

1665
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:20,740
they had quote unquote Mitsui men,
you know, if you were a Mitsui Guy,

1666
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:24,570
that was a big deal. It was like their
Harvard graduates would all go there,

1667
01:49:24,571 --> 01:49:25,860
you know,
and things like that.

1668
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:31,310
And I was at the Chicago
office and the problem was,

1669
01:49:31,621 --> 01:49:36,090
I actually experienced reverse
discrimination by that when,

1670
01:49:36,091 --> 01:49:39,930
I mean is that I had
studied Japanese history,

1671
01:49:39,960 --> 01:49:44,880
political science and Japanese language
a little bit at the University of

1672
01:49:44,881 --> 01:49:49,810
Illinois. Okay. And I had
a pretty good work ethic.

1673
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:53,290
Okay. And, but they couldn't,

1674
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:58,300
it couldn't compute in their mind that
I'm talking about the Japanese. Okay.

1675
01:49:58,470 --> 01:50:01,150
All,
all the manager positions where Japanese,

1676
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:05,800
like the branch manager, he was a vice
president, you know, and all that.

1677
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:11,280
I had no opportunity to ever get to
even to be a department manager in that

1678
01:50:13,781 --> 01:50:18,781
company because they looked at me
and they couldn't compute that.

1679
01:50:18,971 --> 01:50:23,860
I didn't speak Japanese fluently.
Okay. So was in their mind,

1680
01:50:23,861 --> 01:50:28,660
I'm the village idiot. You know, even
though I have my master's degree,

1681
01:50:28,890 --> 01:50:31,120
I had commanded a company in combat.

1682
01:50:31,121 --> 01:50:33,880
I had signed for $10
million worth of equipment,

1683
01:50:34,210 --> 01:50:38,260
I had more responsibility in life and
these guys will ever know, you know,

1684
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:40,750
but they didn't get it.
They don't understand that.

1685
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:44,410
So I did that for about five
years. I mean, I was treated well.

1686
01:50:44,410 --> 01:50:47,680
I have no complaints. But you know, I,

1687
01:50:47,730 --> 01:50:50,020
and I didn't expect any guarantees,

1688
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:55,500
but I had hoped I would have
an opportunity to compete.

1689
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:59,910
And when I saw that wasn't the,
that wasn't going to happen. Uh,

1690
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:01,330
I had a roommate,

1691
01:51:01,860 --> 01:51:06,860
a from the U of I who was a member of
the Chicago board options exchange and

1692
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:12,210
options trading was just
starting at that time. And He,

1693
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:15,580
he was, uh, a great visionary,

1694
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:18,430
a little weak on details.

1695
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,890
And so he had an operation on the floor
of the exchange and he realized he

1696
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:27,550
needed to get a handle on that.
And I'm pretty good with details.

1697
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:30,670
So he called me and he said,
Jim, I know you're not happy.

1698
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:35,790
You know where you're at, which
you want to come work with me. And,

1699
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,790
and I said, hey, wait a second. You
know, I don't have one day of finance,

1700
01:51:39,820 --> 01:51:44,230
formal education. I didn't know the
difference between a stock and a bond or,

1701
01:51:44,231 --> 01:51:48,610
you know, must less a stock option.
And he said, don't worry about it.

1702
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:52,090
I know your abilities, you're
good with math. You know,

1703
01:51:52,091 --> 01:51:56,110
this is not rocket scientist stuff.
And I said, okay, I'll do it.

1704
01:51:56,170 --> 01:52:01,170
And that started out a 35 year career
in financial services industry and I

1705
01:52:01,631 --> 01:52:04,240
became a member of the
New York Stock Exchange,

1706
01:52:04,241 --> 01:52:07,270
the Chicago board options exchange.
I was very blessed.

1707
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:09,400
I became part owner of the company.

1708
01:52:09,670 --> 01:52:14,670
So that enabled me to devote all the time
I did into reserves that I did because

1709
01:52:16,511 --> 01:52:19,360
that was part of the deal I made
with my friend. I said, listen,

1710
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:21,340
if you want me to join you,

1711
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:26,800
I'm bringing the reserves with me
and you have to understand, you know,

1712
01:52:26,801 --> 01:52:27,581
if I'm called,

1713
01:52:27,581 --> 01:52:32,380
I'm going and if I'm in the
reserves I'm going to give it 100%,

1714
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:37,960
you know, and, and, but he
was, he had gone through our
TC with me. Okay. So he was,

1715
01:52:37,961 --> 01:52:40,630
he was an army officer,
so he understood.

1716
01:52:41,050 --> 01:52:44,980
So I was able to have a successful career.
At the same time.

1717
01:52:45,110 --> 01:52:46,250
You moved up really

1718
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,980
quickly through the ranks in the reserves.

1719
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:53,950
Yeah, I had, I had a life,
like I said before, Jocko,

1720
01:52:53,951 --> 01:52:58,350
I had great NC hosts who made me look
good. I had commanders who mentored me.

1721
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:00,000
Uh,
I was,

1722
01:53:00,450 --> 01:53:05,450
I was a brigadier general at the age of
42 and I was a major general three years

1723
01:53:06,121 --> 01:53:10,830
later, obviously the youngest general
in the army at the time. Uh, so yeah,

1724
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:13,470
I was,
I was challenged,

1725
01:53:13,471 --> 01:53:17,240
I had great assignments and so, uh, I,

1726
01:53:17,340 --> 01:53:22,080
I was very blessed and my wife supported
me through all of this. Without her,

1727
01:53:22,081 --> 01:53:24,960
I would not have been able
to get the first face.

1728
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:30,410
I noticed you, you mentioned a couple
times a General William Levine yes.

1729
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:33,470
And,
and sort of the impact that he had on you,

1730
01:53:33,471 --> 01:53:37,730
he was a guy that landed a DDA at Utah
beach and was one of the people that

1731
01:53:37,731 --> 01:53:40,790
liberate a dark hour and in World War II.
Yes.

1732
01:53:41,570 --> 01:53:46,100
Was there any significant lesson learned
that he passed on to you that yeah,

1733
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,950
absolutely. He, he,

1734
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:52,390
I think he's personally
responsible for that balance.

1735
01:53:53,080 --> 01:53:57,670
Part of my leadership concept that
I've developed over my career,

1736
01:53:58,250 --> 01:54:02,110
uh, he really emphasize
family and, and keep in mind,

1737
01:54:02,111 --> 01:54:06,400
when I joined the reserves, I didn't
have a clue about the citizen soldier,

1738
01:54:06,850 --> 01:54:08,590
you know,
those of us on active duty.

1739
01:54:08,591 --> 01:54:11,620
What do we know about the garden
reserves and their pressure,

1740
01:54:12,040 --> 01:54:13,800
you know what they deal with,
you know,

1741
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:17,770
people in the garden reserves have to
balance three balls at the same time.

1742
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:22,630
Right? You've got your, your family,
you've got your civilian career,

1743
01:54:22,631 --> 01:54:26,710
the puts bread and butter on the table,
and then you've got the reserve.

1744
01:54:26,711 --> 01:54:28,600
So the guard, you know, which, you know,

1745
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:33,430
and so you're balancing while
that stuff and General Levine,

1746
01:54:33,490 --> 01:54:36,490
I'll always remember,
emphasize the family.

1747
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:41,830
He always made sure that we were aware of,

1748
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:46,450
uh, the stresses on the family. You know,

1749
01:54:46,451 --> 01:54:50,530
when we were gone, I'll never
forget her, my career without fail.

1750
01:54:50,531 --> 01:54:54,580
That's when the furnace would break down.
That's when we'd have a blizzard.

1751
01:54:54,581 --> 01:54:59,380
So my 95 pound wife would have to go
out there and shovel the snow cause I

1752
01:54:59,381 --> 01:55:04,270
wasn't there. You know, our son
Jay, who's who, who, you know, uh,

1753
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:04,930
he,

1754
01:55:04,930 --> 01:55:09,580
he basically was a rascal when he was
the young guy and my wife had to take him

1755
01:55:09,581 --> 01:55:12,460
to the emergency room in the
hospital like three times.

1756
01:55:13,060 --> 01:55:14,770
I don't even know where
it's at times a week.

1757
01:55:16,420 --> 01:55:20,680
And I don't even know where it's at. You
know, cause I wasn't home. So, you know,

1758
01:55:20,681 --> 01:55:21,740
distresses out enough.

1759
01:55:21,810 --> 01:55:26,810
So he really drove that
home and I understood better
the stresses on the citizen

1760
01:55:29,111 --> 01:55:32,950
soldier, which are tremendous. You know,
at least when you're on active duty,

1761
01:55:32,951 --> 01:55:34,280
you're focused,
you know,

1762
01:55:34,630 --> 01:55:38,290
and you're in a community where everybody
has gone through the same thing.

1763
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:43,370
So they all understand, you know, the
stresses on the marriage. They, you know,

1764
01:55:43,390 --> 01:55:47,910
they share things, they can help each
other out. But in new reserves, in guard,

1765
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:53,220
you know, the rest of the, you go
to a meeting one weekend a month,

1766
01:55:53,640 --> 01:55:57,810
you know, and unless you're in leadership,
you know, that's about it. And,

1767
01:55:58,230 --> 01:56:00,450
uh, you know, you don't have the,

1768
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:05,490
you don't have the bonding
and the community a strength
that you do when you're

1769
01:56:05,491 --> 01:56:06,450
on active duty.

1770
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:08,470
Yeah.
When we got to Ramadi,

1771
01:56:08,471 --> 01:56:11,950
it was the two to eight National Guard
unit out of Pennsylvania and reserve

1772
01:56:11,951 --> 01:56:14,260
units that were on the ground
and they'd been there for,

1773
01:56:14,261 --> 01:56:17,830
I think they'd been there for 14 months,
but boy,

1774
01:56:17,831 --> 01:56:21,260
they were outstanding soldiers. All
of them. There was a real honor to,

1775
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:26,170
to work with them a little bit and then
get the turnover and great guys, they,

1776
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:27,730
you rent,

1777
01:56:27,730 --> 01:56:32,730
you ended up running training for like
21 out of your 25 years in the reserves.

1778
01:56:34,150 --> 01:56:36,990
That's, that's, that's a
lot of training to run.

1779
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:42,280
Yeah. I was, once again, I'd say,
now you've heard me say this before,

1780
01:56:42,281 --> 01:56:46,660
it's a god thing. Uh, basically, uh,

1781
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:50,740
the army was the only service
that really had a great,

1782
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:53,050
uh,
uh,

1783
01:56:53,770 --> 01:56:58,770
process where we had reserve units
whose wartime mission was the takeover,

1784
01:57:00,610 --> 01:57:03,730
the training centers,
you know,

1785
01:57:03,731 --> 01:57:06,640
like the Great Lakes naval
training center, you know,

1786
01:57:07,030 --> 01:57:09,910
but the Navy didn't have that.
The air force didn't have that.

1787
01:57:09,911 --> 01:57:11,050
The Marines didn't have that.

1788
01:57:11,080 --> 01:57:16,080
We had reserve units that their war time
mission was to go to Fort Benning for

1789
01:57:16,181 --> 01:57:16,511
example.

1790
01:57:16,511 --> 01:57:20,860
That was my division's mission was to
go to Fort Benning and take over the

1791
01:57:20,861 --> 01:57:24,040
training of the infantry
officers and recruits,

1792
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:26,110
not officers to recruits at Fort Benning.

1793
01:57:26,890 --> 01:57:31,270
So that the active duty soldiers
that were already there,

1794
01:57:31,271 --> 01:57:33,520
who are up to speed on everything,
you know,

1795
01:57:33,780 --> 01:57:38,740
could go join fighting units basically.
So that was, that was the mission.

1796
01:57:39,060 --> 01:57:42,610
All right. So I joined when
I came off of active duty,

1797
01:57:42,611 --> 01:57:47,611
I joined the 85th training division in
Chicago and that was an infantry training

1798
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:53,311
division at the time and I was with
them for 18 years and I commanded co,

1799
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:58,030
uh, at the company level,
battalion co level,

1800
01:57:58,060 --> 01:58:01,180
Brigade Level and LSE
assistant division commander.

1801
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:03,930
And every year we've,
uh,

1802
01:58:03,931 --> 01:58:08,931
gone annual training to a active duty
training for it and we take over the

1803
01:58:11,171 --> 01:58:16,000
training of the recruits. So I did
it at Dick's, I did it at Fort Bliss.

1804
01:58:16,480 --> 01:58:20,440
I did it at Ford Ord.
And then finally with the 70th,

1805
01:58:20,441 --> 01:58:24,520
I did it at Fort Benning. And so, uh,

1806
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:27,820
then what happened was I,

1807
01:58:28,390 --> 01:58:32,570
I was the commander of the 70th division,
uh,

1808
01:58:32,690 --> 01:58:37,300
out of Livonia, Michigan
and Desert Storm came. Okay.

1809
01:58:37,810 --> 01:58:42,010
And I knew we were going to
be mobilized, uh, you know,

1810
01:58:42,011 --> 01:58:44,020
the handwriting was on the wall.
Okay.

1811
01:58:44,530 --> 01:58:47,920
So I put together a list of,

1812
01:58:47,921 --> 01:58:50,370
I had 16 subordinate units in my,

1813
01:58:50,550 --> 01:58:54,430
I have three brigades in the
training command and other things.

1814
01:58:54,670 --> 01:58:59,050
And so I made a list of ones to 16,

1815
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:03,730
and I prioritize them. Okay. And I,

1816
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:08,650
and it was a mixture of
readiness and leadership,

1817
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:14,080
you know, that's how I prioritize them.
Then I also had to be sensitive to, uh,

1818
01:59:14,410 --> 01:59:16,810
I had units in Indiana and Michigan,

1819
01:59:17,170 --> 01:59:21,220
so I couldn't take all the Michigan
units and Liebau Indiana guys.

1820
01:59:21,221 --> 01:59:24,880
That wouldn't have been fair because
everybody wanted it to be mobilized.

1821
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:29,500
Okay. You have to understand
this was, this is when,

1822
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:32,170
this would be the first time.
Okay.

1823
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:36,700
And we've been practicing
for like 25 years, you know,

1824
01:59:36,730 --> 01:59:40,600
you're ready for Game Day. Yeah. So
the question is if the balloon went up,

1825
01:59:40,601 --> 01:59:45,540
what people show up, you know, and so, so
I had this list and I went to trade doc,

1826
01:59:45,550 --> 01:59:50,200
which was our, uh, a higher
headquarters at Fort Monroe, Virginia.

1827
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:55,060
And I said, listen, here's my
list. Here's my division. Okay?

1828
01:59:55,690 --> 01:59:56,523
I said,

1829
01:59:56,680 --> 02:00:01,680
use this list and if you're going to
mobilize my division or any part of my

1830
02:00:01,811 --> 02:00:02,644
division,

1831
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:07,360
do it in disorder and
don't screw with this.

1832
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:12,550
This is the best way. This is the
best way my division will serve,

1833
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:16,930
you know, the army, did
they comply? Oh yeah,

1834
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:19,000
they were delighted is ask them.

1835
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:22,150
I wasn't the only division
commander that had done that.

1836
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:25,800
So they went out to the other 11
division commanders and they, hey,

1837
02:00:25,801 --> 02:00:29,080
say we need some lists,
you know, and that,

1838
02:00:29,081 --> 02:00:33,160
and they did exactly what I told them
to do because they mobilized half of my

1839
02:00:33,161 --> 02:00:36,970
division. So they just went right down
the list, you know, down to eight or nine.

1840
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:38,440
And then that was it.

1841
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:42,580
And now you ended up having kind of
a run in at the end of your career?

1842
02:00:43,680 --> 02:00:47,550
Yeah, I had several. I, you know,

1843
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:51,220
and it was because of Hackworth,
you know, about face and,

1844
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:55,360
and uh, and the first one was, uh,

1845
02:00:55,810 --> 02:01:00,790
I went on the Oprah Winfrey
show and, uh, basically,

1846
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:04,480
uh, um, my mom was still
alive at that time.

1847
02:01:04,481 --> 02:01:09,040
She used to watch Oprah during the day
and Oprah was out of Chicago. Right.

1848
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:13,840
And then she, and she used to it. I
didn't know this cause I never watched it,

1849
02:01:13,841 --> 02:01:16,960
but she used to announce ahead of time,
uh,

1850
02:01:16,961 --> 02:01:19,720
subjects that she was going to cover.

1851
02:01:19,721 --> 02:01:24,070
And if anybody knew anyone who were
experts in that area of let her know,

1852
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:28,840
you know, so she could get them. So she
decided this is in the late eighties.

1853
02:01:28,930 --> 02:01:29,710
Okay.

1854
02:01:29,710 --> 02:01:34,570
Now put yourself back at that time when
the economy was not doing so hot and the

1855
02:01:34,571 --> 02:01:39,440
Japanese economy was doing real good,
you know, because of their computers,

1856
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:41,780
their automobile stir televisions.

1857
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:47,200
And so people were blaming the Japanese
about our poor economic situation.

1858
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:52,940
And uh,
it was called Japan bashing.

1859
02:01:53,150 --> 02:01:58,150
So in fact there was a Chinese guy's
name was victor Chen who was killed in

1860
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:05,021
Detroit by some automobile workers with
baseball bats because they thought he

1861
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:08,720
was Japanese. He was
actually Chinese. Okay.

1862
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:13,880
So over decided to have a show
about Japan bashing. So she said,

1863
02:02:13,881 --> 02:02:15,480
if anybody knows anyone,
you know,

1864
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:19,570
and the Japanese American community
to where it might be a good, you know,

1865
02:02:19,740 --> 02:02:24,050
person on this, please let me know.
Well, my mom saw that and she said,

1866
02:02:24,230 --> 02:02:26,780
you need to get on the show,
you know?

1867
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:30,770
So I tried calling, I couldn't get,
you know how this is, you know,

1868
02:02:30,771 --> 02:02:34,700
I couldn't get through whatever.
Why have a very, I had at that time,

1869
02:02:34,701 --> 02:02:37,910
a very influential journalists in Chicago.

1870
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:42,440
His name was earth cups in it,
who had a very famous,

1871
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:47,510
it's called cups column.
He used to interview presidents,

1872
02:02:48,320 --> 02:02:52,760
kings and Queens, political
people, you know, at,

1873
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:54,770
in Chicago,
at a restaurant.

1874
02:02:54,860 --> 02:02:59,050
And so I called cup and I
said, hey, because you know,

1875
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:03,470
I'm trying to get through on this
thing with Oprah. And, and he said,

1876
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:05,480
I'll see what I can do.
Okay.

1877
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:10,780
Two hours later I get a call from the
executive producer of the show and he

1878
02:03:11,121 --> 02:03:14,900
says, I understand that you're a
general in the army. I said, yeah,

1879
02:03:14,910 --> 02:03:17,030
I'm in the army reserves and,

1880
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:21,860
and that you're the highest ranking Asian
American and our armed forces today.

1881
02:03:21,861 --> 02:03:25,880
And I said, yeah, that's right.
And he said, well, and, and I,

1882
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:28,670
I was trying to figure out where
the guy was going. Right. Well,

1883
02:03:28,671 --> 02:03:31,850
he was trying to see if I could
chew gum and walk at the same time.

1884
02:03:32,450 --> 02:03:35,420
So once he figured I could
do that, he said, you know,

1885
02:03:35,421 --> 02:03:40,340
we'd like to have you on the show. Okay.
So I said, fine, when is it? Tomorrow.

1886
02:03:41,060 --> 02:03:44,750
Okay. So I said, okay,
I'm in. So I called my,

1887
02:03:44,900 --> 02:03:49,460
at that time I was working for in New
York Stock Exchange firm and I called the

1888
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:53,710
headquarters in New York. I said, hey, I
need a day off. So they gave it to me. Uh,

1889
02:03:54,020 --> 02:03:58,130
and then I called the chief of army
reserves office. Cause keep in mind,

1890
02:03:58,160 --> 02:04:03,080
I'm a two star general, right. And I
said, Hey, I'm going on the Oprah show,

1891
02:04:03,260 --> 02:04:08,030
you know, and uh, what's the subject
while the subject is Japan bashing,

1892
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:10,310
but I'm being invited because,
you know,

1893
02:04:10,311 --> 02:04:15,311
I'm high ranking Japanese American in our
army and I'm going to wear my uniform,

1894
02:04:16,700 --> 02:04:20,870
you know, so, uh, I get a call back. Okay.

1895
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:25,910
From the chief of public affairs of
the army. Now he's a one star. No.

1896
02:04:25,911 --> 02:04:30,200
Okay. Okay. And I'm a two star.
Okay. So he calls and he said,

1897
02:04:30,201 --> 02:04:33,560
I'm understanding you're going to be
on the Oprah show. Yeah, that's right.

1898
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:38,460
What's the subject? Japan bashing.
Oh, it's not about the army. No,

1899
02:04:38,461 --> 02:04:40,610
it's not about the military at all.
You know,

1900
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:45,420
but I'm being invited because I'm the
highest ranking Japanese American in the

1901
02:04:45,421 --> 02:04:49,980
army, in the military. You, the whole
military and being an o eight at the time.

1902
02:04:50,610 --> 02:04:55,500
And he said, well then we don't
want you to wear your uniform. Okay.

1903
02:04:56,100 --> 02:04:58,170
And I said,
listen,

1904
02:04:58,920 --> 02:05:03,920
I take my responsibility very seriously
as a role model from minorities.

1905
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:09,560
This is a great opportunity to let people
know that we have equal opportunity in

1906
02:05:12,241 --> 02:05:16,950
our armed forces. I don't
see this as a, as a, uh,

1907
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:18,930
as a possibility to fail.

1908
02:05:18,990 --> 02:05:23,280
I see this is a opportunity to succeed.
And I,

1909
02:05:23,340 --> 02:05:24,750
and I just said, I, you know,

1910
02:05:24,751 --> 02:05:27,660
I don't really have a lot of time for
this because it was going to be the next

1911
02:05:27,660 --> 02:05:31,960
day, right. So I said, is
this an order, you know,

1912
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:36,450
from, you know, the secretary or from
the chief, I don't care. You know,

1913
02:05:36,720 --> 02:05:40,470
whoever's above me, is
this an order? And he said,

1914
02:05:40,471 --> 02:05:44,160
why can't tell you it's in order?
And I said, well, okay, in that case,

1915
02:05:44,490 --> 02:05:47,310
thank you very much for calling me.
You know,

1916
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:52,350
I appreciate what you said.
I've taken it all in under consideration.

1917
02:05:52,730 --> 02:05:56,340
Bottom line, I'm wearing my uniform.
And that was the end of it. Okay.

1918
02:05:56,610 --> 02:06:01,610
So he writes a memorandum for record that
to the chief of staff in the army that

1919
02:06:02,671 --> 02:06:06,900
went into my file that said, you know,
I spoke to general and woke me Alma.

1920
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:08,560
I told him it was,
you know,

1921
02:06:08,670 --> 02:06:12,960
above his pay grade levels that you
might get involved with, you know,

1922
02:06:13,110 --> 02:06:15,120
things that went out of hand and all that.

1923
02:06:15,121 --> 02:06:18,510
And he basically told me that he
was going to wear his uniform. So,

1924
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:23,700
so I go on to show, okay, and
I'm ready. I do my homework.

1925
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:24,713
Okay.

1926
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:29,460
And we've come back from commercial
break and Oprah starts out by saying,

1927
02:06:29,790 --> 02:06:32,960
and today we have with us
Major General Jim [inaudible],

1928
02:06:33,390 --> 02:06:36,180
the highest ranking Asian American,

1929
02:06:36,181 --> 02:06:40,980
Japanese American in our
military today camera.

1930
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:44,300
And I'm going to sit there
and the civilian suit, I mean,

1931
02:06:44,301 --> 02:06:48,480
what kind of a message would that been?
I was in my class, ace, of course. Okay.

1932
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:52,800
And the first words out
of my mouth were Oprah.

1933
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:58,520
I want everyone to understand that
whatever I say today is the opinion of Jim

1934
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:00,930
McWilliam.

1935
02:07:00,930 --> 02:07:05,930
I am not representing the Department
of the army of not representing the

1936
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:10,410
Department of Defense. However, I am
a soldier in the United States army.

1937
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:11,730
I'm proud of it.

1938
02:07:11,731 --> 02:07:16,731
We have equal opportunity in our armed
forces and the message and the rest of

1939
02:07:18,361 --> 02:07:19,470
the thing went very well.

1940
02:07:19,600 --> 02:07:24,210
And they actually had a guy on there who
I would affectionately referred to as a

1941
02:07:24,211 --> 02:07:28,500
redneck, and he was blaming the
Japanese for all the problems of,

1942
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:32,920
and some of it was correct where
they weren't fair in, in, uh,

1943
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:37,520
some of the economic dealings
with us. Uh, you know, they were,

1944
02:07:37,790 --> 02:07:42,790
their markets were not as open to our
products is they should have been. Uh,

1945
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,780
but on the other hand, the guy was seeing
some nutty stuff. Like he said, well,

1946
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:51,190
they're costing US jobs.
Okay. So I said, okay,

1947
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:54,820
who's the fourth largest automobile
manufacturer in the country?

1948
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:58,690
The answer Honda America.
Okay.

1949
02:07:59,050 --> 02:08:00,670
They have a plant in Marysville,

1950
02:08:00,671 --> 02:08:05,671
Ohio that employed 3,500 American gay.

1951
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:09,610
They can't close that plan
and take advantage your pan.

1952
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,180
It's in the United States.
And I said,

1953
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:18,100
I'm also tired of hearing people complain
about an American quality because the

1954
02:08:18,101 --> 02:08:23,101
Honda civics produced at that plant have
fewer defects than Honda civics that

1955
02:08:23,801 --> 02:08:28,560
were coming from Japan. Jd powers.
I had, I had all this stuff

1956
02:08:30,100 --> 02:08:35,080
with the general. So then I told
them, I said, and guess what?

1957
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:39,430
The steel for that plant
comes from Indiana,

1958
02:08:40,150 --> 02:08:43,990
which is also jobs for Americans.
Okay.

1959
02:08:44,260 --> 02:08:48,370
Then the other thing the guy said was the,
the uh,

1960
02:08:48,550 --> 02:08:52,810
the Asians are taking over
our universities. I said,
what's that all about?

1961
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:57,790
And he said, well, they're getting all the
scholarships. Okay. And I said, listen,

1962
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:04,140
the Asian Americans are not smarter
than any other ethnicity or race.

1963
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:11,550
The reason they do so well in school is
the parents get involved and they make

1964
02:09:12,821 --> 02:09:17,140
sure that their kids study and they
emphasize the value of education.

1965
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:21,010
That got a huge approval
from the audience. You know?

1966
02:09:21,580 --> 02:09:26,020
So what happened was there was a,
believe it or not,

1967
02:09:26,021 --> 02:09:30,580
a federal judge in Chicago
who saw that program. Okay.

1968
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:36,150
So he writes a letter to the
secretary of defense saying you don't,

1969
02:09:36,311 --> 02:09:37,051
unless I saw it,

1970
02:09:37,051 --> 02:09:40,420
the Oprah show and there was this
major general Jim Mccoy Yam who,

1971
02:09:40,421 --> 02:09:45,190
who really did a great job for you guys
and you guys should be proud of him.

1972
02:09:45,310 --> 02:09:49,600
Right. So the secretary of defense
at that time was Dick Cheney.

1973
02:09:50,020 --> 02:09:54,490
Okay. So he endorses the letter
down to the secretary of the army.

1974
02:09:54,730 --> 02:09:58,990
The secretary of the army endorses the
letter down to the chief of staff of the

1975
02:09:58,991 --> 02:10:02,950
army. So when that hits
my file, same time,

1976
02:10:02,951 --> 02:10:04,870
the other thing hit my file,

1977
02:10:05,110 --> 02:10:08,980
basically one canceled the
other photo copy of that back.

1978
02:10:11,950 --> 02:10:14,080
But that's, you know,
so right then and there,

1979
02:10:14,090 --> 02:10:18,120
the army knew what they were dealing
with. Cause I, you know, I've always,

1980
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:19,300
you know,

1981
02:10:19,300 --> 02:10:24,300
it was an opportunity to show that we
have equal opportunity armed forces.

1982
02:10:24,851 --> 02:10:29,851
I tell people that one of the proudest
things of my service was that when I

1983
02:10:31,271 --> 02:10:34,670
would lose track of people's,
you know,

1984
02:10:34,671 --> 02:10:36,560
I stopped looking at people as,

1985
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:40,820
as Asian American or African
American or Hispanic Americans.

1986
02:10:40,821 --> 02:10:44,360
I looked at them as private corporal,
Lieutenant,

1987
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:48,140
whatever their job was,
uh, in the military.

1988
02:10:48,141 --> 02:10:52,100
That's how I caught myself forgetting
sometimes of people, you know,

1989
02:10:52,101 --> 02:10:56,900
cause I tell people everybody
was all of dram. Yeah. Yeah.

1990
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:59,270
So that was my first,
uh,

1991
02:11:00,150 --> 02:11:02,860
no, you started to say
that the book, the book,

1992
02:11:02,861 --> 02:11:05,890
did the book start to play any
kind of role in your career?

1993
02:11:05,891 --> 02:11:07,960
Did people start talking to
you about Hackworth Book?

1994
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:12,090
Uh, no, not really. That,

1995
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:15,430
that'd be when I mean by that is,
you know,

1996
02:11:15,431 --> 02:11:20,431
the whole stance that he
took about Vietnam to risk
his career and just actually

1997
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:23,770
just saying, Hey, I'm outta
here cause you know, I've,

1998
02:11:24,250 --> 02:11:29,200
I've done this now for 30 something
years and frankly it was weighing on him.

1999
02:11:29,201 --> 02:11:29,411
I mean,

2000
02:11:29,411 --> 02:11:34,060
talk about the moral injury of knowing
that you're leading soldiers in combat

2001
02:11:34,090 --> 02:11:37,330
when
they could have been,

2002
02:11:37,480 --> 02:11:39,220
the policy could have been done better,

2003
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:42,310
which would have resulted
in fewer casualties.

2004
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:46,330
Yeah, that's, that's, I dunno if there's
a heavier weight to bear than that,

2005
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:50,530
that to everyone. And then what was
the next thing you took a stance on?

2006
02:11:51,450 --> 02:11:53,490
Well,
the next thing that happened,

2007
02:11:53,491 --> 02:11:57,840
which caused the end of my
career basically is, uh,

2008
02:11:58,040 --> 02:12:00,050
I liked that you say that
with a smile on your face.

2009
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:04,330
I'm, I, I don't regret a
day. There you go. I would,

2010
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:07,150
if I had to do it again today,
I do it in a heartbeat.

2011
02:12:07,420 --> 02:12:12,420
And here's what happened was I was
an army reserve guy sold for full

2012
02:12:12,431 --> 02:12:15,430
transparency to your listeners.
Okay.

2013
02:12:15,431 --> 02:12:17,440
I was on active duty for five years.

2014
02:12:17,441 --> 02:12:21,430
I was on an army be service for 27 years.
Okay.

2015
02:12:21,431 --> 02:12:23,950
Now the army has three components.

2016
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:26,920
They have the active component,

2017
02:12:27,550 --> 02:12:32,260
they had the army reserve and
they had the army national guard.

2018
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:34,190
Okay.
The,

2019
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:38,830
the army reserve and army national guard
or the so called reserve components.

2020
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:43,960
Okay. Now, the active
army, of course, on the 24,

2021
02:12:43,961 --> 02:12:46,330
seven,
that's their full time job.

2022
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:52,170
The army reserves are a federal force
and the army reserves fall into normal

2023
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:58,030
army chain of command.
Department of the army.

2024
02:12:58,450 --> 02:13:02,200
We answered to the orders
of the president. Okay.

2025
02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:07,950
Army National Guard does not
fall into that chain of command,

2026
02:13:08,290 --> 02:13:10,240
nor do they report to the president,

2027
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:14,290
baby port to the governors of each state.

2028
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:17,620
It's really a state organization,

2029
02:13:17,621 --> 02:13:22,621
although 95% of their budget
comes from the federal government.

2030
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:25,910
Okay.
Uh,

2031
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:31,000
and as an Army reservist for 25 years,

2032
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:35,790
27 years,
I saw whenever it came to,

2033
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:40,110
uh,
reducing the army force structure,

2034
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:45,890
the army reserves would always get the
short end and the guard would always be

2035
02:13:46,351 --> 02:13:50,130
protected. Okay. The actives would
always take care of themselves.

2036
02:13:50,160 --> 02:13:52,200
That was never an issue.
Okay.

2037
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:57,770
But the soul called one army concept
where everybody's supposed to be together

2038
02:13:57,871 --> 02:14:01,440
in this, the reserves always
got the short end of the stick.

2039
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:06,060
And the reason for that is the
reserves were a national force.

2040
02:14:06,600 --> 02:14:11,520
Okay. We were professional in, you know,

2041
02:14:11,521 --> 02:14:16,200
in the military, as, as you know,
you're not supposed to be political.

2042
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,080
You're supposed to be apolitical,
right?

2043
02:14:19,140 --> 02:14:21,810
Not involved in lobbying
and stuff like that.

2044
02:14:22,920 --> 02:14:25,830
The National Guard is very political.

2045
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:30,060
It's jobs for the state.
Okay.

2046
02:14:30,090 --> 02:14:31,860
So whenever there's,

2047
02:14:32,070 --> 02:14:35,880
the national guard has
so much political clout,

2048
02:14:36,360 --> 02:14:38,640
if you look at any,
uh,

2049
02:14:38,670 --> 02:14:43,670
presidential election just watched the
week before the election in November,

2050
02:14:44,280 --> 02:14:49,280
that's when the guard normally has
their national convention in DC.

2051
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:53,250
Okay.
And I can tell ya,

2052
02:14:53,430 --> 02:14:56,730
every major presidential
candidate shows up.

2053
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:00,600
Okay. And, and keep in mind,

2054
02:15:00,601 --> 02:15:05,601
they have the political support of a
governor to senators and the congressmen,

2055
02:15:07,510 --> 02:15:12,420
right? The army reserve doesn't have
that political clout. So frankly,

2056
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:16,370
we've always gotten,
gotten screwed. And so I,

2057
02:15:16,580 --> 02:15:19,410
I watched that for 25 years.
I said, enough is enough.

2058
02:15:20,040 --> 02:15:25,040
And so I founded a five o one c three
organization called the Army Reserve

2059
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:28,920
Association,
which was comprised of officers,

2060
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:31,470
enlisted and civilians.

2061
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:36,980
The mission was to educate the public
and Congress about the army reserves

2062
02:15:38,431 --> 02:15:40,980
because people, when they think
of, they hear of the reserves,

2063
02:15:40,981 --> 02:15:44,670
they think of the national guard,
they don't think of the army reserves,

2064
02:15:44,671 --> 02:15:49,500
which has armories and they have
soldiers in every state in our union.

2065
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:52,440
But people don't think about that.
Okay.

2066
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:56,970
So when Desert Storm ended,
right?

2067
02:15:57,630 --> 02:16:00,000
Uh,
when Desert Storm Hit,

2068
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:05,750
the army mobilized both National
Guard and reserve units.

2069
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:11,190
Okay. The national guard
had no full transparency.

2070
02:16:11,191 --> 02:16:13,320
As I said, I'm an army reserve guy. Okay.

2071
02:16:13,321 --> 02:16:17,550
So I'm pretty jaded on this.
You want to say that.

2072
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:22,110
But you know,
the National Guard has great patriots.

2073
02:16:22,260 --> 02:16:26,290
I'm not casting aspersions
on, on dumb at all, you know,

2074
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:30,100
but a facts are facts.
And here's what happened when,

2075
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:33,490
when does the storm hit
the national guard heads,

2076
02:16:33,491 --> 02:16:38,491
three so-called called Premier Infantry
Brigades that were supposed to round out

2077
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:47,350
active duty divisions. Okay. One of
them was the 48th out of Georgia.

2078
02:16:47,860 --> 02:16:48,693
Okay.

2079
02:16:48,970 --> 02:16:53,970
And there isn't a national guard
brigade that upon mobilization,

2080
02:16:54,880 --> 02:16:58,390
they would be assigned to that division
and they would go to war with the

2081
02:16:58,391 --> 02:16:59,800
division.
Okay.

2082
02:17:00,460 --> 02:17:04,390
And what happened was when it came,
and by the way,

2083
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:07,630
they had all the best equipment,

2084
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:12,190
they had better equipment than some
active army battalions and brigades.

2085
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:16,000
They had Abrams tanks. You have to
understand this. The early nineties,

2086
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:21,270
they had Abrams tanks and they had gladly
vehicles when a lot of active units

2087
02:17:22,031 --> 02:17:23,470
didn't have that.
Okay.

2088
02:17:23,830 --> 02:17:28,830
But they were publicized as being the
Premier Army National Guard combat units

2089
02:17:31,810 --> 02:17:35,620
that were ready to go to war.
Okay. When the balloon went up,

2090
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:40,780
the army said, we can't send these guys.
They're just going to be cannon fodder.

2091
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:43,270
So they sent them to the NTC,

2092
02:17:43,271 --> 02:17:47,290
the National Training Center in
California for 90 days. Okay.

2093
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:51,370
Only problem was the war ended so quick.
They never got to the,

2094
02:17:51,790 --> 02:17:55,720
they never got there. All right.
The reserves on the other hand,

2095
02:17:56,560 --> 02:18:01,540
our soldiers perform magnificently. We had
helicopter units, we had medical units,

2096
02:18:01,870 --> 02:18:06,850
we had civil affairs, we had
psyops. We, uh, you know,

2097
02:18:06,851 --> 02:18:11,740
our, our people did extremely, my training
division. Perfect example. You know,

2098
02:18:11,741 --> 02:18:12,670
we were mobilized.

2099
02:18:12,671 --> 02:18:16,420
I had my guys in the front gates
of Fort Benning within 72 hours.

2100
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:21,280
And my drill instructors
around the trail. My, my, uh,

2101
02:18:21,880 --> 02:18:26,770
uh, my, my, uh, instructors
are on the platform teaching,

2102
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:29,040
you know,
running the rain

2103
02:18:29,100 --> 02:18:33,090
truths and all that.
And so then when it came time to downsize,

2104
02:18:33,360 --> 02:18:37,320
is that where you took a stand?
Yeah, absolutely. What happened

2105
02:18:37,350 --> 02:18:40,620
Ben, was that, you know, when the we,

2106
02:18:40,820 --> 02:18:45,600
so we wind up desert storm and then the
Soviet Union falls apart and the wall

2107
02:18:45,601 --> 02:18:46,680
comes down,
right?

2108
02:18:46,980 --> 02:18:51,980
So everybody's looking for this piece
of the night to transfer money from the

2109
02:18:52,860 --> 02:18:55,260
Defense Department to social services.
Okay.

2110
02:18:55,770 --> 02:19:00,770
And so the army has a process that's
called the total army analysis.

2111
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:08,120
It's a very good logical process so you
can determine the force structure that

2112
02:19:09,781 --> 02:19:12,210
we need for the army.
Okay.

2113
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:16,170
And the way it works is
you look at what are the,

2114
02:19:17,520 --> 02:19:20,820
what are we facing throughout the world?
You know,

2115
02:19:20,821 --> 02:19:25,140
what are the problem areas? And
then you say to yourself, okay,

2116
02:19:25,141 --> 02:19:26,100
based on that,

2117
02:19:26,370 --> 02:19:30,230
how many divisions do
infantry divisions do we need?

2118
02:19:30,231 --> 02:19:34,820
How many armored units, how
many helicopter battalion,
you know, blah, blah, blah.

2119
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:38,870
And then you face reality and you say,

2120
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:42,440
how much money can really
get out of Congress for this?

2121
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:46,550
So based on all that stuff,
you come up with a force structure.

2122
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:49,580
Okay.
The army didn't do that.

2123
02:19:50,450 --> 02:19:55,450
What they did is they had the
vice chief of staff of the army,

2124
02:19:56,690 --> 02:20:01,220
the chief of army reserves,
the chief of the National Guard Bureau,

2125
02:20:01,850 --> 02:20:04,700
the President of the
National Guard Association,

2126
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:07,480
which is not a government group.

2127
02:20:08,060 --> 02:20:13,060
And the president of the Reserve Officers'
association go to a hotel and they

2128
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:19,991
cut a deal and it was called the offsite
agreement because it wasn't done at the

2129
02:20:20,871 --> 02:20:25,700
Pentagon. Okay, well I told you I had
formed this Army Reserve Association.

2130
02:20:25,990 --> 02:20:26,823
All right?

2131
02:20:27,260 --> 02:20:31,670
I had people in that meeting within
five minutes I knew what happened.

2132
02:20:32,480 --> 02:20:36,830
And the army reserves really they,

2133
02:20:37,100 --> 02:20:42,100
they eliminated 80% of army reserve
aviation and we had four special forces

2134
02:20:44,121 --> 02:20:48,500
groups at that time in the
reserve components there are
to national guard groups,

2135
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:53,720
the 19th and 20th and to army
reserve special forces groups.

2136
02:20:53,721 --> 02:20:55,550
The 11th and the 12th.

2137
02:20:55,820 --> 02:21:00,350
The 12th episode was one of the
units that I was under my command.

2138
02:21:01,190 --> 02:21:04,130
I was the deputy commanding
general of an army reserve unit.

2139
02:21:05,420 --> 02:21:07,730
So I'll give you an example.

2140
02:21:07,731 --> 02:21:12,731
We had a Black Hawk battalion once again
in my army reserve under my command

2141
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,020
that fought in the golf.

2142
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:19,640
They were so good that Schwarzkopf
selected them for his taxi unit.

2143
02:21:20,210 --> 02:21:24,680
Okay. And they had received, uh, the, uh,

2144
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:28,640
it's called the Army
Aviation Association Award,

2145
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:32,060
Aaa Award for the Best
Black Hawk battalion.

2146
02:21:33,560 --> 02:21:35,750
So that's how good these guys were.
Okay.

2147
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:41,320
This agreement eliminated that unit out
of the army reserves and put it into the

2148
02:21:43,161 --> 02:21:47,510
Illinois National Guard.
Okay. No, I'm a big boy. I,

2149
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:52,190
I can, I can accept, I don't
appreciate it as a taxpayer,

2150
02:21:52,191 --> 02:21:55,130
but I can accept waste
of money or whatever.

2151
02:21:56,060 --> 02:22:01,060
Where I draw the line in the sand is when
you jeopardize soldiers' lives and the

2152
02:22:01,611 --> 02:22:04,970
readiness of our forces.
Okay.

2153
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:08,030
This unit overnight.
Oh,

2154
02:22:08,031 --> 02:22:12,260
what I didn't tell you was the Illinois
National Guard did not have one

2155
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:15,510
qualified black hawk pilot or mechanics.

2156
02:22:16,670 --> 02:22:21,670
They could not even fly those birds from
Scott Air Force base where we had them

2157
02:22:22,460 --> 02:22:26,340
to the Illinois National Guard field.

2158
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:31,790
They had to go to the Wisconsin and
Minnesota Guard to borrow pilots so they

2159
02:22:32,911 --> 02:22:34,140
could move those birds.

2160
02:22:34,740 --> 02:22:39,420
Now the implication is that
unit overnight went from c one,

2161
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:43,500
you know, the highest rating
this rating down the SiFive,

2162
02:22:43,980 --> 02:22:48,330
which is non nondeployable basically,
you know,

2163
02:22:48,740 --> 02:22:53,740
and if it took about two B years plus
to get that unit up to c three which is

2164
02:22:56,761 --> 02:23:00,720
just marginal deployment level.
Okay? So that's one example.

2165
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:04,200
Another example are those
special forces groups. Okay.

2166
02:23:04,440 --> 02:23:08,610
The army looked at the four reserve
components, special forces groups,

2167
02:23:09,090 --> 02:23:11,940
and they said, you know,
we only need two. Okay,

2168
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:16,480
so we'll eliminate the
national guard, you know, uh,

2169
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:19,320
groups because you know,
why does the National Guard govern?

2170
02:23:19,350 --> 02:23:23,310
Why does the governor need a Farsi
speaking demolitions expert? Okay.

2171
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:27,960
In the last time I looked, we didn't
have an insurgency in Illinois. So,

2172
02:23:28,740 --> 02:23:31,590
so the National Guard says,
no, we don't accept that.

2173
02:23:32,040 --> 02:23:36,870
So the army with their tail between their
legs go back to the drawing board and

2174
02:23:36,871 --> 02:23:38,220
they looked at readiness,

2175
02:23:38,340 --> 02:23:40,710
which is what they probably
should have done to begin with.

2176
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:45,480
And they found out that the 12th group
in the USA in the army reserves was the

2177
02:23:45,481 --> 02:23:48,120
best auto, the four.
And then it was either,

2178
02:23:48,150 --> 02:23:52,560
I think it was the 20th out of
the guard was the second best.

2179
02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:57,150
So they said, okay, we got to solution,
we'll take one out of each component.

2180
02:23:57,930 --> 02:24:00,450
Right.
Guard wouldn't accept that.

2181
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:05,220
So what did they do?
They eliminated both army reserve,

2182
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:07,530
you know,
groups.

2183
02:24:07,531 --> 02:24:12,120
And I was livid because the 12th
was under me at one time. Uh,

2184
02:24:12,330 --> 02:24:14,490
I wasn't the commander of a,
but it was in my chain.

2185
02:24:15,060 --> 02:24:20,060
We had taken that unit from c four to c
two which for a reserve unit to be able

2186
02:24:23,461 --> 02:24:28,461
to get reservist to pass those
special forces qualifications,

2187
02:24:30,180 --> 02:24:34,770
that's not easy. Okay. And
they eliminated that unit.

2188
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:38,280
Now I'm a big boy.
Okay.

2189
02:24:38,281 --> 02:24:42,480
When it came like to the the
helicopter units and I said,

2190
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:44,273
okay,

2191
02:24:44,700 --> 02:24:48,570
take my pilots and so and and mechanics,

2192
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:53,460
take the reserve patch off their shoulder,
make a national guardsman,

2193
02:24:53,820 --> 02:24:55,920
I'm good with it.
Okay.

2194
02:24:56,430 --> 02:25:01,200
They wouldn't do it because
it was jobs for the guard.

2195
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:04,800
So my guys had to find new jobs.

2196
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:08,790
Some of them had to actually change a
molasses cause you know, there were no,

2197
02:25:10,110 --> 02:25:12,630
no aviation jobs for them.
Right.

2198
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:17,990
And just think you and I as taxpayers,
how much that costs us, you know, so,

2199
02:25:18,010 --> 02:25:22,980
so now I'm getting all kinds
of calls from the field. Uh,

2200
02:25:23,130 --> 02:25:25,870
know we didn't have computers
at that time in the Internet.

2201
02:25:25,870 --> 02:25:29,590
So I'd get telephone calls
and faxes saying general,

2202
02:25:29,591 --> 02:25:32,650
somebody has got to stand
up and fight this, you know,

2203
02:25:33,100 --> 02:25:35,350
and that meeting I told
you about that they had,

2204
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:41,170
I found out from my moles that in
essence they were going to have a press

2205
02:25:41,171 --> 02:25:46,171
conference the next day where everybody
was going to hold hands and sing Kumbaya

2206
02:25:47,650 --> 02:25:52,650
and say that the army has come up with
this great agreement where everybody

2207
02:25:54,551 --> 02:25:58,030
agrees and nobody disagrees.
While that wasn't true,

2208
02:25:58,570 --> 02:26:00,340
a lot of people disagreed with it.

2209
02:26:00,730 --> 02:26:05,590
So I called the vice chief of
staff's office at the Pentagon,

2210
02:26:06,010 --> 02:26:09,350
right.
Not as Major General Jim [inaudible],

2211
02:26:09,850 --> 02:26:14,740
but as Jim [inaudible], President
Army Reserve Association. Okay.

2212
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:20,040
So I call asking for a
return call about this,

2213
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:24,430
this press conference, it's going
to happen or announcement, you know,

2214
02:26:24,910 --> 02:26:28,900
and I didn't get a call back.
So the next morning,

2215
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:34,000
an hour before their press conference,
we sent out a press release

2216
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:39,640
and we basically said, this is
not good. This is, you know,

2217
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,960
shouldn't go through,

2218
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:45,770
need to have a Gao study of government
accounting office study. Uh,

2219
02:26:45,790 --> 02:26:50,560
and that pretty well got
me into the crosshairs.

2220
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:54,520
And so then what we did is,
and now we keep in mind,

2221
02:26:54,521 --> 02:26:58,870
I had never done this in my
life. I'd never lobbied. I
had never been to Congress.

2222
02:26:58,871 --> 02:27:03,580
I had never walked the halls, you
know, any of that stuff. We had a,

2223
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:08,890
we actually, and I think I might've sent
you some of this stuff, but we had a, a,

2224
02:27:08,990 --> 02:27:13,990
a meeting of the Army Reserve
Association called for in Washington DC.

2225
02:27:14,860 --> 02:27:19,860
And I had men and women come from all
over the country and we went and we

2226
02:27:22,270 --> 02:27:26,860
lobbied our senators and congressmen
and we told them, this is wrong.

2227
02:27:27,190 --> 02:27:29,720
This needs to,
the needs to be a g o state.

2228
02:27:29,721 --> 02:27:34,660
It needs to be studied before it's
implemented. Okay. Now, frankly,

2229
02:27:34,661 --> 02:27:39,100
I knew we were tilting at windmills,
but I had to do it because, you know,

2230
02:27:39,101 --> 02:27:44,101
all I was getting all these bequest from
sergeants and civilians and lieutenants

2231
02:27:46,211 --> 02:27:48,160
and majors throughout the country saying,

2232
02:27:48,161 --> 02:27:52,060
somebody got to fight
this and they were right.

2233
02:27:52,390 --> 02:27:53,560
So I had to do it some.

2234
02:27:53,561 --> 02:27:57,550
Then I get an invitation from
a congressional subcommittee.

2235
02:27:58,150 --> 02:28:03,070
Okay. It was not a subpoena, so I
didn't have to go, I could have set,

2236
02:28:03,071 --> 02:28:07,690
I've got a headache or I've got a conflict
or whatever, but I didn't, you know,

2237
02:28:07,691 --> 02:28:11,320
I said, yeah, I'll be there.
And I went and I testified,

2238
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:16,300
and a year later I was history,
shall we say,

2239
02:28:17,720 --> 02:28:20,320
but it's a, like I said, Jocko, I,

2240
02:28:20,830 --> 02:28:24,800
I wouldn't hesitate in a
moment to do it again. Uh,

2241
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:27,050
it's when I was in Vietnam,

2242
02:28:27,051 --> 02:28:31,370
I knew that our generals for not
standing up for us all the time like they

2243
02:28:31,371 --> 02:28:33,140
should.
And I said,

2244
02:28:33,590 --> 02:28:38,110
ever get to a point in life where it's
the difference between my career and,

2245
02:28:38,780 --> 02:28:41,090
and my soldiers,
the soldiers when,

2246
02:28:41,560 --> 02:28:46,470
yeah, perhaps a ruby. And that's one of
those balance things too, is you know,

2247
02:28:46,480 --> 02:28:48,910
as a leader where you know,
you, you want to tow the line.

2248
02:28:48,911 --> 02:28:52,210
And I have people ask me this
pretty regularly. Well, you know,

2249
02:28:52,480 --> 02:28:54,820
you always say you want a sport,
the chain of command,

2250
02:28:54,821 --> 02:28:57,040
but with the chain of command is
wrong. Well, it's real simple answer.

2251
02:28:57,041 --> 02:29:00,640
If the chain of command is wrong
and it's something that matters,

2252
02:29:00,730 --> 02:29:03,880
like the safety of your troops, the
training of your troops, then you,

2253
02:29:04,060 --> 02:29:06,790
you stand up to it, you
know, if it's something that
doesn't matter for, they go,

2254
02:29:06,791 --> 02:29:09,700
oh, we want you to fill out this paperwork
differently than you did it yesterday.

2255
02:29:09,730 --> 02:29:12,790
You know what I do? I do it
right. I don't care. You know,

2256
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:15,550
you want me to put my uniform on this
way instead of that way? That's fine.

2257
02:29:15,730 --> 02:29:16,780
Whatever.
I'll do it.

2258
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:21,760
You want to start putting soldiers a
jeopardy that won't, that won't stand.

2259
02:29:21,790 --> 02:29:25,600
So here's what happened. Okay.
While all this stuff is going on,

2260
02:29:25,870 --> 02:29:30,870
the Washington Post puts this front
page and it talks about how the,

2261
02:29:32,350 --> 02:29:36,480
the, uh, this big controversy,
you know, in my associations,

2262
02:29:36,490 --> 02:29:40,390
right at the forefront of all the, so
I'm quoted in all it. Now keep in mind,

2263
02:29:40,391 --> 02:29:44,820
I am still an active army reserve,
major general that trade on life.

2264
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:49,330
And, and in fact, before I testified,

2265
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:53,920
I got a call from the chief of staff at
trade. Doc was a good friend of mine.

2266
02:29:53,921 --> 02:29:57,100
We're both major generals and,
and uh,

2267
02:29:57,880 --> 02:30:02,260
he didn't tell me I shouldn't go. He
kind of said that, well, you know,

2268
02:30:02,261 --> 02:30:05,440
it's really not a good idea,
you know, for you to go.

2269
02:30:05,650 --> 02:30:08,760
And he was a good friend of mine
and I said, John, you know, I,

2270
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:13,030
I understand this is, you
have to do this, this is your,

2271
02:30:13,480 --> 02:30:16,390
this is your job, but
I got to go. I can't,

2272
02:30:17,200 --> 02:30:22,120
I cannot stand by and
let this pass. So, uh,

2273
02:30:22,121 --> 02:30:25,970
he under, well, and so that was
also Linda Washington folks.

2274
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:30,370
Like I was threatened, I wasn't
threatened, you know, and so,

2275
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:32,770
so basically,
uh,

2276
02:30:32,860 --> 02:30:37,860
I then the army times wrote an editorial
which basically criticized the army

2277
02:30:41,201 --> 02:30:44,230
reserves, especially my
association, you know,

2278
02:30:45,430 --> 02:30:49,820
and saying the army reserves are
not team players. They're crybabies,

2279
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:51,333
you know,

2280
02:30:51,370 --> 02:30:56,050
and but what got me is when they said
they're putting out bad information. Okay.

2281
02:30:56,051 --> 02:31:00,310
That was in their editorial.
Okay. So I wrote an op Ed.

2282
02:31:01,150 --> 02:31:01,750
Okay.

2283
02:31:01,750 --> 02:31:06,750
Which to their credit they published or
claim and in the op Ed I said number one

2284
02:31:09,130 --> 02:31:11,980
where is,
and the title of their,

2285
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:15,760
their editorial was the enemy is us.
Okay.

2286
02:31:16,540 --> 02:31:19,920
And I said, I agree
with you, the enemy us.

2287
02:31:20,520 --> 02:31:23,220
But the problem is number one,

2288
02:31:23,700 --> 02:31:28,700
where is you didn't list in detail the
false information that was being put up

2289
02:31:32,221 --> 02:31:36,930
by the reserves. So you need to
do that. I said that in the op Ed,

2290
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:41,070
they never did by the way, because
we had never put out anything false.

2291
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:45,090
But the second thing I said,
and I said,

2292
02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:50,330
if we go to war in the next 18
months and this thing goes through,

2293
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:55,170
we're going to have people coming
back in body bags that would not have,

2294
02:31:56,400 --> 02:32:00,360
I mean, now that's a pretty serious
statement, isn't dude. Okay.

2295
02:32:00,690 --> 02:32:04,950
And you would think if I was chicken
little saying the sky was falling,

2296
02:32:05,490 --> 02:32:10,350
that they would have been inundated with
letters from the field saying yield.

2297
02:32:10,351 --> 02:32:14,340
The general's gone too far.
Right? They didn't get one letter.

2298
02:32:16,770 --> 02:32:20,760
And so, but so because of the
stand I took, needless to say,

2299
02:32:21,390 --> 02:32:23,460
the army wasn't real happy with me.

2300
02:32:24,120 --> 02:32:27,900
And a year later when it came time to,
uh,

2301
02:32:28,260 --> 02:32:31,770
to get a new assignment,
a surprise, surprise,

2302
02:32:31,771 --> 02:32:36,520
I was not considered a, there were
no assignments that I was, uh,

2303
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:41,490
considered eligible for. And so
I, I said, this has been fun.

2304
02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:46,420
So the chief of army reserve
actually wanted me to stay. Uh,

2305
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:49,440
and he said, this too shall
pass, so why don't you stay,

2306
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:50,880
you can go into control group,

2307
02:32:50,881 --> 02:32:55,140
which is kind of this administrative pool
of people who don't have assignments.

2308
02:32:55,710 --> 02:32:58,740
And maybe in a year or two
you can come back, you know,

2309
02:32:58,741 --> 02:33:02,580
we'll get you an assignment. And
I said, no. I said, you know,

2310
02:33:02,581 --> 02:33:06,810
the army's made it very clear, you
know, they don't want my services,

2311
02:33:06,811 --> 02:33:09,450
they don't think I have any
value and I'm going to move on.

2312
02:33:09,800 --> 02:33:13,500
I got to move on in life.
And No. So what I did

2313
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:16,530
now, even though you
moved on, he retired, uh,

2314
02:33:16,560 --> 02:33:19,770
you didn't stop serving by any
stretch. And, and you know,

2315
02:33:19,771 --> 02:33:24,771
I look at the military outreach that
you started is really your new way of

2316
02:33:25,141 --> 02:33:27,240
serving it. Was that, is
that an accurate statement?

2317
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:30,710
Oh, absolutely. What, what
happened was, you know,

2318
02:33:30,711 --> 02:33:35,150
my wife is so wonderful, she,
she said she's not as, as,

2319
02:33:35,151 --> 02:33:39,170
as a Christian as I am,
but she lives her life better than I do.

2320
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:43,610
And so I'm having my personal pity
party feeling sorry for myself,

2321
02:33:43,611 --> 02:33:48,500
cause my 32 year career is down
the toilet. Right. And she said,

2322
02:33:48,501 --> 02:33:53,210
Jim, you know, God is sending
you a message, number one,

2323
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:58,640
that you know, this chapter in your
life is over. Okay. Number two,

2324
02:33:59,570 --> 02:34:01,070
you survived Vietnam.

2325
02:34:02,210 --> 02:34:06,440
You also became attained the
rank of two star general,

2326
02:34:06,470 --> 02:34:09,770
which was the highest of reservists
could get at that time. Okay.

2327
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:13,580
And then she says, number three,
and you've got me as a wife,

2328
02:34:14,930 --> 02:34:18,220
how can I argue with that? Right?
But she was absolutely right.

2329
02:34:18,221 --> 02:34:22,090
What happened was God brought other
things into my life. At that time,

2330
02:34:22,720 --> 02:34:26,480
a promise keepers, which was
a men's Christian group. Uh,

2331
02:34:27,070 --> 02:34:31,780
I got, uh, involved with
a church in Chicago. Oh,

2332
02:34:31,781 --> 02:34:36,500
Willow Creek community church, which
was a very famous evangelical church. I,

2333
02:34:37,030 --> 02:34:41,140
I led a men's small group.
I lead a men's monthly breakfast.

2334
02:34:41,620 --> 02:34:44,980
I got involved with the
Department of Veterans Affairs,

2335
02:34:44,981 --> 02:34:48,950
which I had never been involved
in before at a national level. Uh,

2336
02:34:49,090 --> 02:34:54,090
I was a chairman of an advisory
committee on minority veterans and I was,

2337
02:34:54,341 --> 02:34:56,830
uh,
I was on that for five years.

2338
02:34:57,190 --> 02:35:00,310
So I learned about the VA system.
Uh,

2339
02:35:00,311 --> 02:35:05,311
all of this was in preparation for me to
eventually start military outreach USA

2340
02:35:07,330 --> 02:35:09,700
about seven years ago.
Uh,

2341
02:35:09,730 --> 02:35:14,480
which is a nonprofit faith
based organization. Uh,

2342
02:35:14,830 --> 02:35:16,690
for the very simple concept.
Jocko.

2343
02:35:16,990 --> 02:35:21,990
We're trying to develop a
national network of partners,

2344
02:35:22,330 --> 02:35:26,150
mostly houses of worship of
all faiths by the way. Uh,

2345
02:35:26,240 --> 02:35:30,610
and organizations like, uh, the VFW,

2346
02:35:30,820 --> 02:35:35,620
American Legion, Rotary Clubs,
lions clubs, highschools.

2347
02:35:35,830 --> 02:35:40,830
This is all at the local community level
that will reach out to our military

2348
02:35:41,621 --> 02:35:46,060
community, which we defined by
the way is active duty reserves,

2349
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:50,860
national guard veterans of all
eras and their family members.

2350
02:35:50,860 --> 02:35:55,600
We stressed the family members equally
because they serve and sacrifices well.

2351
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:59,350
Okay.
And to reach out to them,

2352
02:35:59,380 --> 02:36:03,910
to be a welcoming environment,
to appreciate their service,

2353
02:36:03,911 --> 02:36:08,530
recognize that and to offer
hope and help if they need it.

2354
02:36:09,220 --> 02:36:12,880
Now the churches and
synagogues want to help.

2355
02:36:13,300 --> 02:36:18,300
They don't know how to do it because they
don't understand the military culture.

2356
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:24,000
They don't know the issues
that our military community
is facing and they don't

2357
02:36:25,181 --> 02:36:29,800
know where the resources are. That's
where military outreach USA comes in.

2358
02:36:30,100 --> 02:36:32,890
We provide all of that information.

2359
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:37,330
We have webinars,
we have publications,

2360
02:36:37,690 --> 02:36:42,070
we have DVDs,
we have presentations,

2361
02:36:42,490 --> 02:36:47,110
and everything that we do
is free of charge, no cost.

2362
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,680
The only thing we ask is when people
join us as partners either as a house of

2363
02:36:52,721 --> 02:36:57,721
worship or as an organization that they
commit to take our materials and use

2364
02:36:57,821 --> 02:37:02,620
them to help our military community.
It doesn't cost them anything.

2365
02:37:03,830 --> 02:37:08,450
And if people want to want to help out
military outreach USA and though the

2366
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:13,460
website is military outreach usa.org.

2367
02:37:13,820 --> 02:37:16,100
That's correct. And then from
what, what are you looking

2368
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:19,250
for?
Well we have numerous programs.

2369
02:37:19,251 --> 02:37:24,251
See Cause we understand houses of
worship come in all shapes and sizes.

2370
02:37:24,740 --> 02:37:29,000
Okay. So we have different
programs that they can choose from.

2371
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:32,080
Some are as simple as uh,

2372
02:37:32,480 --> 02:37:37,480
a church can list the names of service
members who are currently serving,

2373
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:40,100
you know,
either relatives or,

2374
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:43,700
or members of the church and
people can pray for them.

2375
02:37:44,240 --> 02:37:48,560
Prayer is so important
when you're overseas,

2376
02:37:48,561 --> 02:37:50,690
especially in a combat situation.

2377
02:37:50,691 --> 02:37:54,020
I know it helped me a lot
when I was in combat. Uh,

2378
02:37:54,110 --> 02:37:57,380
I needed all I could
get, I'll tell Ya. Uh,

2379
02:37:57,590 --> 02:38:00,230
but also they could do
things like send packages,

2380
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:04,580
send letters today who writes
letters? Nobody, you know,

2381
02:38:04,581 --> 02:38:06,500
it was all email and all that stuff.

2382
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:11,000
How about getting a letter right
at mail call? How neat is that?

2383
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:16,220
Uh, you know, uh, but then we can
also do things for veterans. Uh,

2384
02:38:16,430 --> 02:38:19,310
in fact, we, we have, uh,

2385
02:38:19,340 --> 02:38:22,460
two years ago we started a program.
And by the way,

2386
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:27,700
we have a memorandum of agreement that
was signed by the Department of Veterans

2387
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:32,480
Affairs in 2016 by the secretary himself,

2388
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:37,960
which recognize military outreach USA
as a national partner with them on a

2389
02:38:39,141 --> 02:38:44,141
program that we initiated called
veteran's exiting homelessness.

2390
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:47,490
Okay. Now here's the thing. Uh,

2391
02:38:47,570 --> 02:38:52,570
the Va has done a very good job in
reducing the veteran homeless population.

2392
02:38:54,501 --> 02:38:59,480
It's still too high. But three years
ago it was like 150,000, you know,

2393
02:38:59,481 --> 02:39:02,690
it's like 50,000 now, which is
still too high. But look at the,

2394
02:39:03,050 --> 02:39:06,320
look at the reduction. Okay, well
that's created a new problem.

2395
02:39:06,920 --> 02:39:10,940
And the problem is when they
take a homeless veteran,

2396
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:12,050
male or female,

2397
02:39:12,051 --> 02:39:17,051
some with kids off the street and they
work with a case worker or a social

2398
02:39:17,481 --> 02:39:18,830
worker.
Okay.

2399
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:23,270
And the social worker feels that they're
stabilized and now they can get him

2400
02:39:23,271 --> 02:39:27,920
into what is called permanent housing,
which is really an apartment.

2401
02:39:28,310 --> 02:39:32,990
That's God. It's subsidized
by a Hud vash voucher. Okay.

2402
02:39:33,410 --> 02:39:37,880
They give them the keys to the
apartment. Right. But homeless people,

2403
02:39:37,881 --> 02:39:42,050
that's all they give them. So Jessica, the
first time you moved into an apartment,

2404
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:46,850
yeah. Needs stuff. Lysol
toilet paper buckets.

2405
02:39:47,240 --> 02:39:51,440
Uh, sponges, mops, uh, you know, dishes.

2406
02:39:51,470 --> 02:39:55,670
How about a bed? Homeless people?
They get a one bedroom apartment,

2407
02:39:55,671 --> 02:39:58,430
but guess what? They
don't have a bed. Right.

2408
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:03,760
So we came up with this program called
move in essentials and we listed things

2409
02:40:05,241 --> 02:40:07,910
like we have a bathroom kit,
we have a kitchen kit,

2410
02:40:08,180 --> 02:40:11,660
we even have a beds for vets program.
Okay.

2411
02:40:11,990 --> 02:40:16,620
And what we've done is we've
gone out to our, our churches,

2412
02:40:16,621 --> 02:40:20,130
our partners, you know,
organizations and we've asked him,

2413
02:40:20,131 --> 02:40:24,810
can you conduct a donation
drive of this stuff? Okay.

2414
02:40:25,350 --> 02:40:29,130
And not asking them collect
money gimme the stuff. Okay.

2415
02:40:29,131 --> 02:40:33,690
And then it's delivered
to the Va Medical Center,

2416
02:40:33,900 --> 02:40:38,400
social worker,
and they distribute it to the veterans.

2417
02:40:38,700 --> 02:40:42,420
So we know they're going to
veterans. Okay. Cause you know,

2418
02:40:42,421 --> 02:40:45,750
there are a lot of people out there
who clean to be veterans who are not.

2419
02:40:46,140 --> 02:40:50,790
And so we know they're going to veterans
and it goes out almost as quick as it

2420
02:40:50,791 --> 02:40:52,260
comes in.
Okay.

2421
02:40:52,830 --> 02:40:57,120
This has helped us a great deal
as an organization because before,

2422
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:58,501
uh,
we're,

2423
02:40:58,501 --> 02:41:03,060
we're at a point in time where we really
can move up to the next level as an

2424
02:41:03,061 --> 02:41:07,380
organization,
but we frankly need volunteers and money.

2425
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:12,060
Okay. Cause we don't have a staff. We'd
done all this on a shoestring basically.

2426
02:41:12,450 --> 02:41:14,070
And so,
uh,

2427
02:41:14,490 --> 02:41:19,490
with this program we now have
results that we can show people.

2428
02:41:20,010 --> 02:41:23,670
Okay. So people come to
me and say, Jim, you know,

2429
02:41:23,671 --> 02:41:26,880
what difference are you guys making?
Two years ago,

2430
02:41:27,270 --> 02:41:32,010
all I could say was while we're developing
this network of partners and we're

2431
02:41:32,011 --> 02:41:36,840
asking numb to help, you know, in their
communities, which did make a difference,

2432
02:41:36,841 --> 02:41:39,870
by the way.
I mean we prevented some suicides.

2433
02:41:39,871 --> 02:41:42,990
We've helped people that needed stuff,
you know,

2434
02:41:43,440 --> 02:41:45,380
but we did the have,
I didn't,

2435
02:41:45,390 --> 02:41:50,150
I don't have the staff to record
all of this stuff, you know, button.

2436
02:41:50,160 --> 02:41:51,720
When we came up with this program,

2437
02:41:52,380 --> 02:41:56,850
we have a tracking thing where we know
how many veterans are being helped.

2438
02:41:57,180 --> 02:42:00,630
We know what's been collected and we know.

2439
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:05,220
So now if somebody says, what
difference do you make? Okay.

2440
02:42:05,250 --> 02:42:10,250
Since January of 2016 we have
helped over 31,000 veterans.

2441
02:42:13,110 --> 02:42:18,110
We've collected over 750,000 items.

2442
02:42:20,010 --> 02:42:20,341
In fact,

2443
02:42:20,341 --> 02:42:25,341
I think it's over a million now
and valued at almost $2 million.

2444
02:42:26,340 --> 02:42:27,750
And we have,

2445
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:32,370
we just provided this month our 1000 bed.

2446
02:42:33,870 --> 02:42:38,850
Okay. Uh, and so now I've got stuff
that I can tell people this. Well,

2447
02:42:38,851 --> 02:42:43,851
we've come up with a new program this
year and has called adopt a caregiver.

2448
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:48,090
Okay.
See what we're trying to do is fine.

2449
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:53,600
Find gaps where there's a need
and nobody else is filling it.

2450
02:42:54,330 --> 02:42:57,900
So we first we did that veterans
exiting homelessness thing.

2451
02:42:58,350 --> 02:43:03,350
Well now there are 5.5 million
military caregivers in our country.

2452
02:43:06,870 --> 02:43:07,703
Okay.

2453
02:43:08,040 --> 02:43:13,040
Serving over 1.1 million
milled former military.

2454
02:43:14,260 --> 02:43:15,093
Okay.

2455
02:43:15,250 --> 02:43:20,250
And they get some help from the VA
but not a lot as much as they need.

2456
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:23,620
Okay.

2457
02:43:23,620 --> 02:43:28,620
So we are now going to our churches and
our organizations and we're saying we

2458
02:43:29,111 --> 02:43:32,770
have this program adopt a caregiver.
Okay.

2459
02:43:33,130 --> 02:43:35,470
And if you want to be a caregiver,

2460
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:40,450
you let us know and we'll
contact the local social worker,

2461
02:43:40,900 --> 02:43:45,550
volunteer support at the
Va facility near you.

2462
02:43:46,060 --> 02:43:51,060
And we'll hook you up with
a caregiver that needs help.

2463
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:55,480
Now this could be anything. It could
be babysitting, could be mowing along,

2464
02:43:55,720 --> 02:44:00,340
it could be shoveling snow,
it could be a showing up with a meal.

2465
02:44:00,580 --> 02:44:04,720
It could be just showing up and being
there for three hours and let the

2466
02:44:04,721 --> 02:44:07,750
caregiver get a break.
Okay.

2467
02:44:07,751 --> 02:44:11,590
This is not rocket scientist stuff.
It's an easy program,

2468
02:44:12,040 --> 02:44:16,360
but it's something that if we can get
this moving like we did the veterans

2469
02:44:16,361 --> 02:44:20,800
succeeding homelessness, it's going to
be a tremendous help for our veterans.

2470
02:44:20,980 --> 02:44:25,930
And but most importantly for the
caregivers you see on an another lifetime,

2471
02:44:25,931 --> 02:44:29,650
my wife and I were hospice
patient volunteers.

2472
02:44:30,190 --> 02:44:31,750
We did that for six years.

2473
02:44:32,500 --> 02:44:37,500
So I know how it is to deal
with a terminal illness.

2474
02:44:37,870 --> 02:44:38,703
Okay.

2475
02:44:38,740 --> 02:44:43,740
But I also witnessed that it's the
caregivers who are sometimes need to help

2476
02:44:45,221 --> 02:44:48,700
more than the patient,
you know?

2477
02:44:48,730 --> 02:44:53,730
And so in this case we've got military
caregivers that need help and we can do

2478
02:44:54,311 --> 02:44:55,330
it through this program.

2479
02:44:57,730 --> 02:44:59,560
Well it sounds like,
like I said,

2480
02:44:59,561 --> 02:45:03,880
you're continuing to serve even
though you're no longer in uniform.

2481
02:45:04,840 --> 02:45:08,950
And I think that's probably a pretty
good place to wrap up for today.

2482
02:45:08,951 --> 02:45:11,350
And you know,
again,

2483
02:45:11,980 --> 02:45:16,300
it's been just an absolute honor to
sit down and talk with you as we get

2484
02:45:16,301 --> 02:45:18,490
feedback from this episode.

2485
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:21,970
I will come to Chicago
and go to your museum and,

2486
02:45:22,270 --> 02:45:24,340
and we'll do this again.

2487
02:45:24,420 --> 02:45:24,930
Yeah,
let me,

2488
02:45:24,930 --> 02:45:29,930
let me say one thing that able to get in
and anybody who knows me would tell me,

2489
02:45:30,811 --> 02:45:34,890
Jim, why didn't you say that?
I have a standard mantra. Okay.

2490
02:45:35,370 --> 02:45:39,330
And that is every day is a great day.
I have my faith,

2491
02:45:39,450 --> 02:45:43,110
my family, and live in the
finest country in the world.

2492
02:45:43,500 --> 02:45:48,480
I see it every day, every chance
I got. And people ask me, well,

2493
02:45:48,481 --> 02:45:52,110
why? You know, how can you be so positive
and you know, why do you say that? I say,

2494
02:45:52,111 --> 02:45:53,850
well,
number one,

2495
02:45:54,030 --> 02:45:59,030
as a very young 24 year old company
commander in Vietnam in combat,

2496
02:46:00,240 --> 02:46:03,570
there were times I didn't know if I
was going to be alive the next moment,

2497
02:46:03,960 --> 02:46:08,010
much less seed and next sunrise.
When you're in those circumstances,

2498
02:46:08,011 --> 02:46:12,440
what is important in life becomes
real focused. And that is faith,

2499
02:46:12,530 --> 02:46:16,460
family and living in the finest
country in the world now.

2500
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:18,770
So Zen people will come
back at me and say,

2501
02:46:18,771 --> 02:46:23,240
well how can you say that when we have
so much division in our country? Okay.

2502
02:46:23,690 --> 02:46:26,630
And I say, listen, I'm a little
bit longer in tooth than you are.

2503
02:46:27,080 --> 02:46:29,660
And when I was a kid,
the,

2504
02:46:29,661 --> 02:46:34,610
I've seen the improvements in our
society when it comes to race relations.

2505
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:39,010
Now I'm a minority. So I
get it. And I told them the,

2506
02:46:39,170 --> 02:46:41,690
the odds of me becoming,
when I was a kid,

2507
02:46:41,930 --> 02:46:46,510
the odds of me becoming a major journal
in the United States army were slimming

2508
02:46:46,560 --> 02:46:50,090
next to none. Okay. When you know,

2509
02:46:50,091 --> 02:46:54,260
when we've had an African American
president who was reelected,

2510
02:46:54,950 --> 02:46:58,850
and then I tell people when
President Kennedy was elected,

2511
02:46:59,030 --> 02:47:03,170
that was a big deal. And, and
a lot of people don't know why.

2512
02:47:03,350 --> 02:47:07,550
And I say because he was Catholic,
but today that that's, that's,

2513
02:47:07,620 --> 02:47:09,440
that's not a big deal. Right. And that,

2514
02:47:09,441 --> 02:47:11,960
that though in those
days that was a big deal.

2515
02:47:12,200 --> 02:47:16,940
So I tell people every day is a great
day. I have my faith, my family,

2516
02:47:16,970 --> 02:47:19,730
we live in the finest
country in the world. Well,

2517
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:25,360
that saying was challenged about five
and a half years ago when I had some

2518
02:47:25,491 --> 02:47:26,660
health challenges,

2519
02:47:26,780 --> 02:47:30,950
which I think I didn't mention it
earlier than a writer you ever. Uh,

2520
02:47:31,730 --> 02:47:36,730
I was still working in a
financial services industry
and I got up in the morning

2521
02:47:37,011 --> 02:47:40,070
or shaving and I felt
this pain in my chest.

2522
02:47:40,760 --> 02:47:45,350
And I mean, it wasn't a serious
pounding and I wasn't sweating,

2523
02:47:45,351 --> 02:47:49,850
nausea, so I didn't have a temperature.
So, uh, I thought it was something I ate,

2524
02:47:50,180 --> 02:47:54,440
you know, give it five minutes, it'll
go away. Right. It didn't go away.

2525
02:47:54,770 --> 02:47:59,690
So I told my wife, this is not good.
So I finished shaving and dressing. No,

2526
02:47:59,960 --> 02:48:04,670
and she drove me to the emergency room
at the hospital. So I walk in and I say,

2527
02:48:04,671 --> 02:48:07,850
Hey, you know, I've got this pain in
my chest. I don't know what it is.

2528
02:48:08,150 --> 02:48:12,590
So they do an EKG and they said,
you have had a heart attack.

2529
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:16,910
Well, suddenly all these doctors
and nurses swoop into the Er,

2530
02:48:16,911 --> 02:48:20,840
they undress me and they put me in
a hospital gown amount of Gurney,

2531
02:48:20,870 --> 02:48:24,290
and I'm on my way to the operating room,
right?

2532
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:28,880
So I'm in the corridor and on this
Gurney and I say to myself, self,

2533
02:48:28,940 --> 02:48:33,860
can you say today is a great day?
And I said, I absolutely can.

2534
02:48:34,580 --> 02:48:36,020
I survive Vietnam.

2535
02:48:36,860 --> 02:48:41,860
I have a wonderful wife and children
and I most importantly have my faith.

2536
02:48:45,620 --> 02:48:50,600
So in 24 hours I had three operations.

2537
02:48:51,140 --> 02:48:55,100
The first operation was for the heart
attack. Okay. Say do an angiogram.

2538
02:48:55,100 --> 02:48:59,210
They found out my LDD,
which is the widow maker artery,

2539
02:48:59,211 --> 02:49:03,770
was 90% blocked. So they do an
angioplasty, put a stent in.

2540
02:49:04,190 --> 02:49:07,980
So by 10 o'clock in the
morning, I'm a Newbie. Cover
your room sign figuring. Well,

2541
02:49:07,981 --> 02:49:11,580
that's, that's the end of it,
right? That wasn't the end of it.

2542
02:49:12,180 --> 02:49:15,900
The second thing that happened was my
heart cavity started to fill up with

2543
02:49:15,901 --> 02:49:20,820
liquid, it's called a fusion.
So I had to go back in for an,

2544
02:49:21,270 --> 02:49:24,810
they had to put a hole in my chest so
they could put a tube there so they could

2545
02:49:24,811 --> 02:49:27,930
drain this liquid and
it filled up a bottle.

2546
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:30,660
It took about 24 hours to do that.
Okay.

2547
02:49:31,260 --> 02:49:35,160
The third thing that happened
then was my kidneys failed,

2548
02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:40,260
so I had to go back in and they had to
put another hole in my chest so they

2549
02:49:40,261 --> 02:49:43,350
could hook up a day dialysis machine.
Okay.

2550
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:46,080
So the standard procedure,

2551
02:49:46,200 --> 02:49:51,120
every time I was rolled into the
operating room is, what's your name?

2552
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:54,270
What's your birthday?
How do you feel? Okay,

2553
02:49:54,510 --> 02:49:57,810
so I'm on the operating table
and I say Jim Mcclean Yama,

2554
02:49:58,260 --> 02:50:02,970
August 3rd 44 every day is a great day.
I have my faith,

2555
02:50:02,971 --> 02:50:05,880
my family, and live in the
finest country in the world.

2556
02:50:06,660 --> 02:50:09,900
I can't tell you the effect that
had on the doctors and nurses.

2557
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:15,060
The first operation, the doctor said,
what is your faith? And I said, well,

2558
02:50:15,061 --> 02:50:19,200
since you asked me doc, I said, I'm
a Christian. Christ is my savior.

2559
02:50:19,550 --> 02:50:24,030
You're a skilled physicians, skilled
nurses, but I'm in God's hands.

2560
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:28,470
So whatever he decides I'm okay with,
so let's get on with it.

2561
02:50:29,010 --> 02:50:33,270
So the second operation there
was a nurse and she said,

2562
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:36,270
where do you go to
church? And I said, well,

2563
02:50:36,271 --> 02:50:40,320
I attend Willow Creek Community Church.
And she said,

2564
02:50:40,710 --> 02:50:45,090
I do too. So no coincidence,
the third operation,

2565
02:50:45,360 --> 02:50:46,560
this was the coolest thing.

2566
02:50:47,130 --> 02:50:51,540
There was a male nurse who
is wearing a camouflage gone.

2567
02:50:52,290 --> 02:50:56,640
And I said, you must have been in the
army, nick. I said, yeah, I was a medic.

2568
02:50:57,060 --> 02:51:01,740
And I said, well, Hey, I just want you to
know I've retired as a two star general,

2569
02:51:01,830 --> 02:51:03,690
so take good care of me,
William.

2570
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:08,100
And so that was kind of my testing of,
of all that.

2571
02:51:08,220 --> 02:51:11,760
Now the final thing I'll tell you,
which was a god thing,

2572
02:51:12,250 --> 02:51:16,710
a month later I was going,

2573
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:18,960
I had to go through dialysis.
Okay,

2574
02:51:19,050 --> 02:51:24,050
so I'm going through this dialysis and
and three months later I get a donor and

2575
02:51:24,271 --> 02:51:27,120
the donor was our daughter.
Okay.

2576
02:51:27,600 --> 02:51:30,240
But our daughter is not
our biological daughter.

2577
02:51:30,540 --> 02:51:35,340
We adopted her 30 something years
ago and yet she was a match.

2578
02:51:36,570 --> 02:51:40,260
So guys,
when I say every day is a great day,

2579
02:51:40,590 --> 02:51:44,790
I have my faith, my family, and live in
the kind of finest country in the world.

2580
02:51:45,180 --> 02:51:47,400
I can truly say that.
And every day,

2581
02:51:48,080 --> 02:51:51,900
every day is an encouragement to me.
Okay?

2582
02:51:51,930 --> 02:51:56,930
Today was an encouragement this morning
when I was honored to participate in the

2583
02:51:57,240 --> 02:52:02,240
National Day of prayer with the 79
the theater sustainment command at Los

2584
02:52:03,420 --> 02:52:08,350
Alamitos. And this podcast
is an encouragement to me.

2585
02:52:08,470 --> 02:52:13,120
So I just want you to know that you
don't remember, every day is a great day.

2586
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:17,290
Faith family. We live in the
finest country in the world.

2587
02:52:18,750 --> 02:52:19,583
Well,
sir,

2588
02:52:20,390 --> 02:52:24,720
even though this is my podcast and
I'm supposed to talk after that,

2589
02:52:24,870 --> 02:52:29,340
I don't really have anything else to say.
Thank you so much for coming on.

2590
02:52:29,430 --> 02:52:34,110
It's been a complete honor to have you
and I look forward to doing this again at

2591
02:52:34,111 --> 02:52:35,520
some point in the future.

2592
02:52:35,850 --> 02:52:40,850
Thank you so much and the general has
left the building and we have actually

2593
02:52:42,451 --> 02:52:47,451
relocated back to our recording studio
and just amazing opportunity and

2594
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:53,960
definitely thanks to thanks
to Jay Uchiyama for connecting
us and send a little

2595
02:52:57,721 --> 02:53:00,390
gift to you as well,
so thanks for,

2596
02:53:00,540 --> 02:53:05,040
thanks for putting this together
with your dad and echo. Yes.

2597
02:53:05,130 --> 02:53:08,660
Speaking of putting things together,
yes.

2598
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:14,160
If somebody wanted to put
together something for
themselves and maybe something

2599
02:53:14,161 --> 02:53:17,280
that would, you know it's
porch. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2600
02:53:17,970 --> 02:53:19,800
Could you brief us on those things?

2601
02:53:19,880 --> 02:53:21,080
Namely your joints.

2602
02:53:21,081 --> 02:53:25,220
Do you want to keep those together
because it's a big deal if they're not

2603
02:53:25,221 --> 02:53:28,430
together, so good news if you
didn't, all right already,

2604
02:53:28,431 --> 02:53:30,230
even though you didn't know already.
Jocko supplements,

2605
02:53:30,260 --> 02:53:35,260
they're called Jocko
Super Krill Krill oil,

2606
02:53:35,930 --> 02:53:40,100
but that's not in the name.
Technically. Also Jocko joint warfare,

2607
02:53:40,101 --> 02:53:43,510
also free joints obviously
take both of them.

2608
02:53:43,670 --> 02:53:46,340
There's some anti-inflammatory
stuff in there too, by the way.

2609
02:53:47,840 --> 02:53:50,960
Something that I might've
mentioned before. Anyway,
for you join. It's very good.

2610
02:53:50,990 --> 02:53:51,823
Very important.

2611
02:53:52,490 --> 02:53:57,030
Subscribe for the the recurring delivery.

2612
02:53:57,350 --> 02:53:58,790
Yeah,
cause you don't want to run out.

2613
02:53:59,120 --> 02:54:02,030
I'm telling you it's junk when you run
out everyone out before it's whack.

2614
02:54:02,560 --> 02:54:07,100
I'm also disciplined supplement called
discipline. It is a pre workout,

2615
02:54:07,101 --> 02:54:09,860
pre mission, pre study, pre take tests,

2616
02:54:09,920 --> 02:54:13,940
pre cognitive enhancing supplements.
Good. This is a good one.

2617
02:54:14,090 --> 02:54:17,480
Pre get after it and it tastes good.
Interestingly enough,

2618
02:54:17,660 --> 02:54:21,470
Jocko focused a lot on that. Tastes
good. Lemon, lime, et Cetera, et cetera.

2619
02:54:23,090 --> 02:54:27,590
How many calories in this one?
I Dunno. Not, not very many.
30 alright, there you go.

2620
02:54:27,591 --> 02:54:29,690
So you can do it while you fast too.
Technically.

2621
02:54:30,530 --> 02:54:33,650
Depends on your metabolic response.
Look into it before you fast.

2622
02:54:33,651 --> 02:54:37,280
I'm not going to make any claims. None
the less. It's a good one for your brain.

2623
02:54:37,370 --> 02:54:42,020
For your body. Good supplement. Also milk.

2624
02:54:42,710 --> 02:54:45,440
Yeah. So I'm was going to
say, let me, teen powder.

2625
02:54:45,770 --> 02:54:49,790
So milk, protein powder. Do you, are you,

2626
02:54:49,791 --> 02:54:52,510
are we even calling it protein powder or
are we just calling this trade out more?

2627
02:54:52,890 --> 02:54:57,170
It's not, it's milk. Straight up.
More with them lots. Yeah. Yeah.

2628
02:54:57,890 --> 02:55:02,760
So that is chocolate chip
mint chocolate chips.

2629
02:55:02,790 --> 02:55:07,430
There's no chips. Yeah. Yeah. So if you
don't like mint chocolate chip, you might,

2630
02:55:07,460 --> 02:55:10,760
there's a chance you might not like this.
If you do like mint chocolate chip,

2631
02:55:10,970 --> 02:55:11,970
there's a real good job.

2632
02:55:12,440 --> 02:55:15,980
Like I would say around 100% probability
you're going to like this one.

2633
02:55:16,430 --> 02:55:17,570
I should clarify that.

2634
02:55:18,770 --> 02:55:23,030
I mix it primarily with milk.
Me Too.

2635
02:55:23,870 --> 02:55:28,380
I have mixed it also plain with wealth.
Not playing, but with cold water. Yeah,

2636
02:55:28,700 --> 02:55:32,150
it's with milk.
It's straight up delicious.

2637
02:55:32,210 --> 02:55:35,590
It's like it's a milk straight up. It's
a milkshake. You like, Oh, what? What?

2638
02:55:35,591 --> 02:55:39,890
What do I truly in the world want to
have for dessert? I want to have milk.

2639
02:55:40,460 --> 02:55:42,770
Right.
With water,

2640
02:55:43,670 --> 02:55:48,610
it's more like a ham sandwich.
You Sir. You know like,

2641
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:51,620
okay, hey, this thing is good. I, you
know, I need some fuel. You don't,

2642
02:55:51,621 --> 02:55:56,330
you don't get all fired up when you have
a ham sandwich, right? Yeah. You're not.

2643
02:55:56,331 --> 02:56:00,920
You're not, you're not reaching the next
level. You're happy. You're not fired up.

2644
02:56:01,580 --> 02:56:05,660
That's kind of what my milk with
water is like a ham sandwich.

2645
02:56:05,930 --> 02:56:09,770
It's better for you,
but tastes, tastes. Um,

2646
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:14,160
reaction is about the same
for me. Ham Sandwich. Okay.

2647
02:56:16,010 --> 02:56:19,130
With, with milk. So it's, it's legit.

2648
02:56:19,220 --> 02:56:21,230
What is it like a what
like a state states.

2649
02:56:21,400 --> 02:56:25,760
It's like a stately comparatively boom.
Jockos review on law.

2650
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:28,700
Well official actually no it's not.
It's like a mint chocolate chip milkshake.

2651
02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:32,300
That's what it's like. Yeah. Because
the steak is a different thing for me.

2652
02:56:32,650 --> 02:56:36,560
Steak is a little bit of a
different experience. That's
a really good experience.

2653
02:56:36,561 --> 02:56:39,710
So technically you can't
replace steak. No, no.

2654
02:56:40,400 --> 02:56:43,690
But if you look at the
last fast I did and I,

2655
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:46,760
and I posted that picture
and I went and got that.

2656
02:56:47,300 --> 02:56:52,300
I went and got a killer stake and I think
it was so good because he did it after

2657
02:56:53,661 --> 02:56:57,560
the fact. So good. Yeah. So you got
100% of the tastes, 100% of the tastes.

2658
02:56:57,770 --> 02:57:00,110
No more than 100% of the country.
10%

2659
02:57:02,300 --> 02:57:07,300
somebody sent me some Tomahawk
steaks to my house and they came with

2660
02:57:09,591 --> 02:57:13,760
instructions from the company that sent
them on how to cook them. And I'll,

2661
02:57:13,850 --> 02:57:16,730
I don't remember the name of the company
right now. I follow those instructions.

2662
02:57:16,731 --> 02:57:21,280
I cook those steaks. Hmm.
Those things were APIC. Yeah,

2663
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:25,190
they were epic. Yeah.
So interestingly, yeah,

2664
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:27,980
no stakes came to my house
or anything like that.

2665
02:57:27,981 --> 02:57:30,140
Or you need a houses next to mine,
but hey,

2666
02:57:30,230 --> 02:57:33,830
they do sound good and they sound even
better after cause currently we're

2667
02:57:33,831 --> 02:57:37,880
getting our fast on. Yes.
Currently. Officially to, yeah.

2668
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:43,190
What are we at right now?
Wow. Well I you, I'm a,

2669
02:57:43,310 --> 02:57:48,310
I'm a 23 hours or something right now
and I think I'm at like 18 right now was

2670
02:57:48,750 --> 02:57:53,100
good. Do you need an 11 o'clock last
night? Yeah. You gotta issues. That's not,

2671
02:57:53,110 --> 02:57:54,830
what are you doing eating
the 11 o'clock at night?

2672
02:57:54,831 --> 02:57:59,831
Because like I don't really start eating
till like later in the day he said I

2673
02:58:00,071 --> 02:58:02,220
don't eat breakfast.
Like you see them playing though late,

2674
02:58:02,380 --> 02:58:04,830
let's say eat three meals a day.
And that's not a lot by the way.

2675
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:08,610
That's actually a little bit, you know,
some kinds of it. Six Times d, You know,

2676
02:58:08,611 --> 02:58:11,490
that kind. Not like that guy
three times a day. Sometimes two.

2677
02:58:11,790 --> 02:58:15,870
So let's say I ate my first
meal, no breakfast, only water,

2678
02:58:16,290 --> 02:58:21,240
maybe some coffee, sometimes, maybe some
Gatorade, something maybe like a banana,

2679
02:58:21,241 --> 02:58:24,690
sometimes not a lot.
Nonetheless at noon Ish,

2680
02:58:24,691 --> 02:58:26,610
one maybe to lunch,

2681
02:58:27,270 --> 02:58:31,980
dinner aid in a like six boom and
then again at 11 that's normal.

2682
02:58:31,981 --> 02:58:35,970
That's not that much. Do what you
want to do over there. Nonetheless,

2683
02:58:35,971 --> 02:58:37,890
I'm at about 18 hours.
Give or take.

2684
02:58:37,980 --> 02:58:39,600
And that state that you
were just talking about,

2685
02:58:39,601 --> 02:58:41,160
the Tomahawk one sounds real good.

2686
02:58:41,880 --> 02:58:45,780
Better because right now real fired up.
By the way.

2687
02:58:45,781 --> 02:58:48,180
You didn't even mention where you
can get all this good stuff. We'll,

2688
02:58:48,181 --> 02:58:50,190
there's even more good stuff.
So what I,

2689
02:58:50,250 --> 02:58:54,060
what I like to do is like get us real
excited about everything and then it's

2690
02:58:54,061 --> 02:58:56,130
like Dang, where can
you get it? Boom origin.

2691
02:58:56,940 --> 02:59:00,420
I do want to say we have in
the testing phase right now,

2692
02:59:02,160 --> 02:59:05,010
chocolate, peanut butter, milk, milk.

2693
02:59:05,250 --> 02:59:08,730
Now everyone's probably
wondering, Hey, what's up?

2694
02:59:08,790 --> 02:59:12,600
What's up with just
chocolate milk? Yeah. We,

2695
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:16,470
for whatever reason, I don't know if
it's the complimentary of flavors,

2696
02:59:16,471 --> 02:59:21,471
but we haven't been able to
nail the chocolate flavor
the way we want it at this

2697
02:59:23,011 --> 02:59:26,490
time. Yeah. Yeah. The the men, I don't
know. You know the men is awesome.

2698
02:59:26,880 --> 02:59:31,650
The chocolate peanut butter APIC. Yeah.
We haven't nailed the chocolate yet.

2699
02:59:31,710 --> 02:59:34,530
We got vanilla, the Vanilla's.
I'm not a vanilla fan,

2700
02:59:35,430 --> 02:59:38,160
but the vanilla's good.
I can't,

2701
02:59:38,161 --> 02:59:42,090
I can't give it nine stars because I,
I can't give nine stars.

2702
02:59:42,091 --> 02:59:47,091
Two things that I don't personally really
love the taste of because I don't love

2703
02:59:47,281 --> 02:59:49,030
vanilla.
I'll try it again once it,

2704
02:59:49,050 --> 02:59:53,370
once we roll out with the
actual live vanilla milk,

2705
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:56,850
but the chocolate milk
Wilcom when we get it right,

2706
02:59:56,940 --> 03:00:01,060
but the peanut butter milk
stand by to get some make sense.

2707
03:00:01,830 --> 03:00:05,850
Isn't that the whole kind of defining
factor of the vanilla flavor? It's like,

2708
03:00:05,851 --> 03:00:08,430
it's not supposed to be amazing.
It's supposed to be vanilla.

2709
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:13,080
Like people use the word vanilla.
This guy, let me tell you,

2710
03:00:13,081 --> 03:00:15,540
I actually, let me tell you when, when,

2711
03:00:16,770 --> 03:00:20,160
when I do absolutely love vanilla flavor.

2712
03:00:21,060 --> 03:00:23,370
You know when you go to a restaurant
and you're like, all right,

2713
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:27,900
tonight we're going to get some and use
her order dessert and you get some kind

2714
03:00:27,901 --> 03:00:31,680
of a chocolate scenario.
Let's say, let's just,

2715
03:00:31,681 --> 03:00:36,330
let's just talk about a chocolate as
hot chocolate Brownie, right? Yeah.

2716
03:00:36,331 --> 03:00:38,880
You roll up one of those.
So there's uh, the, my,

2717
03:00:39,120 --> 03:00:43,380
my local one of my local restaurants,
they have a dessert,

2718
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:48,690
they call it the legal cause it's so good.
It should be illegal.

2719
03:00:49,290 --> 03:00:52,950
This is Ragland Ragland ob and what it is,

2720
03:00:52,951 --> 03:00:57,951
they take a cast iron skillet and they
put a chocolate chip cookie in there.

2721
03:01:00,130 --> 03:01:03,730
And then, and I, I, when they make it
for us, we don't get it. I don't know.

2722
03:01:03,731 --> 03:01:08,731
Once every two months we'll go illegal
time and that extra ice cream cause you

2723
03:01:10,451 --> 03:01:14,920
need it. Cause it's got that chocolate,
it's hot. It's so good. And you know what,

2724
03:01:14,921 --> 03:01:19,040
I just realized we're on a 24
hour fast right now. All dog food.

2725
03:01:20,040 --> 03:01:22,240
I'm like Dang,
this is taken kind of long.

2726
03:01:22,241 --> 03:01:23,610
But it kind of don't mind it cause that,

2727
03:01:23,630 --> 03:01:27,730
and you're right about that vanilla thing
too, by the way, because people do, well,

2728
03:01:27,731 --> 03:01:31,020
people do use the word violet vanilla
to describe a real big old other bland

2729
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:34,060
vanilla, which is, you know,
it's not great, but it's not,

2730
03:01:34,061 --> 03:01:38,050
John could still borrow cast iron skillet.

2731
03:01:38,130 --> 03:01:41,290
You're 100% right. Especially when
you said when you go to a restaurant.

2732
03:01:41,291 --> 03:01:43,630
I was like, Bro, I know where you're going
with this. And you're absolutely right.

2733
03:01:43,780 --> 03:01:46,300
So that being said,
so what do you do then?

2734
03:01:46,480 --> 03:01:49,510
You put some chocolate like
Hershey's syrup in the vanilla milk.

2735
03:01:50,080 --> 03:01:52,010
That's a violation, Huh?
Boy, that'd be a big file.

2736
03:01:52,011 --> 03:01:56,840
It just sounds real good right now.
I'm just, that's why nonetheless,

2737
03:01:57,050 --> 03:02:01,340
the illegal, it should be illegal
for us to Duke I've been on,

2738
03:02:01,520 --> 03:02:03,290
I've been fasting before
and on the podcast,

2739
03:02:03,380 --> 03:02:06,560
but this is different when I know that
you're headed in the same boat and this

2740
03:02:06,561 --> 03:02:09,290
is kind of like, uh, usually
I'm just cruising at home.

2741
03:02:09,291 --> 03:02:11,060
Like I didn't done it before for sure,

2742
03:02:11,120 --> 03:02:14,270
but it was crazy at home and it's
like boom. But now like, yeah,

2743
03:02:14,271 --> 03:02:16,240
once you get to talking
about it, shoot, then I,

2744
03:02:16,241 --> 03:02:18,020
and I got to drive by
Wendy's on the way home.

2745
03:02:19,680 --> 03:02:23,880
Something check.
Either way you get all this stuff,

2746
03:02:24,360 --> 03:02:28,950
vanilla milk, not right now. Uh, chocolate
peanut butter milk now, right now,

2747
03:02:29,670 --> 03:02:34,300
chocolate mint, mint chocolate
right now, right now.

2748
03:02:34,301 --> 03:02:38,730
And we go home and have one origin
main.com that's where you get it. Boom.

2749
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:42,300
And all the others, the Jocko, Super
Krill that that is like everyday stuff.

2750
03:02:42,301 --> 03:02:46,770
You gotta take that one every day, get
on the subscription thing. But these,

2751
03:02:46,771 --> 03:02:49,470
you know all this other stuff after
all of it, like I said, all of it.

2752
03:02:49,620 --> 03:02:53,070
Origin main.com also at origin mean,
I'll tell you what there's on,

2753
03:02:53,071 --> 03:02:56,850
there is geese for Jujitsu,
very important.

2754
03:02:57,360 --> 03:03:01,100
When you start Jujitsu or if you already
started, you just, you need a gay.

2755
03:03:02,910 --> 03:03:07,530
People still ask and I'm glad they do
because I have the answer for him. What?

2756
03:03:07,531 --> 03:03:09,840
Gee Do I get? I started, did
you see what he do? I get,

2757
03:03:09,841 --> 03:03:11,910
sometimes I ask the color and
that's a whole different question,

2758
03:03:11,911 --> 03:03:15,120
but they say what brand of key,
here's the brand origin brand,

2759
03:03:15,170 --> 03:03:18,510
100% made in America best.

2760
03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:22,500
These are the gies that like Pete
and all that. When they make them,

2761
03:03:22,650 --> 03:03:25,830
they take into consideration
all the movements of Jujitsu,

2762
03:03:26,210 --> 03:03:29,180
like everything even down
to this and think about it,

2763
03:03:29,210 --> 03:03:32,160
we might not even have thought about it
like outside of when you put this on.

2764
03:03:32,790 --> 03:03:37,260
Okay, so in a regular gay, they have the
string to tie on the pants, not the mill,

2765
03:03:37,290 --> 03:03:41,100
the string on the fence. Then you have
a belt that goes over the, the gay top,

2766
03:03:41,101 --> 03:03:45,180
all that stuff. No, that string
fine. We're used to it and fine.

2767
03:03:45,720 --> 03:03:46,470
It's a cool stream,

2768
03:03:46,470 --> 03:03:50,100
but you ever like put in the dryer where
it got caught on something or whatever

2769
03:03:50,101 --> 03:03:54,070
and that string gets lost in the
little too. I didn't even know you,

2770
03:03:54,530 --> 03:03:55,590
but you see what I'm saying?
Right.

2771
03:03:55,910 --> 03:03:59,240
Like project Hoodie happen to your Hoodie
and you've got to get the hanger and

2772
03:03:59,241 --> 03:04:00,620
you've got to do this big thing.

2773
03:04:00,770 --> 03:04:04,320
If you even know how otherwise you're
kind of screwed in a way cause you gotta

2774
03:04:04,340 --> 03:04:06,800
go all up in there.
Now take the origin gay.

2775
03:04:06,810 --> 03:04:09,530
These are just these details that when
you get someone who's thinking of this

2776
03:04:09,531 --> 03:04:12,420
kind of stuff, when they
designed the whole Geek, you
got some [inaudible] there.

2777
03:04:13,070 --> 03:04:16,220
This is one of the many reasons why
you get the origin. Get this one,

2778
03:04:16,250 --> 03:04:18,530
the string comes out.
That's okay because it's not this,

2779
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:23,010
this endless black hole
loop holder tunnel.

2780
03:04:23,080 --> 03:04:23,980
Use names in.
Yeah.

2781
03:04:24,170 --> 03:04:28,880
It's like it'll have like a giant
thick wide belt loops. Yeah.

2782
03:04:28,970 --> 03:04:31,460
And a bunch of them too. So
you have like, you know, it's,

2783
03:04:31,490 --> 03:04:34,670
it's so easy to put them in.
That's even if you even want the string.

2784
03:04:35,090 --> 03:04:37,790
If you don't want the string,
you're like, Hey, I'm over strings.

2785
03:04:37,820 --> 03:04:38,960
I don't like tying my string.

2786
03:04:39,410 --> 03:04:41,920
They give you this little bell and
you'll see if you have origin Gig,

2787
03:04:41,921 --> 03:04:45,830
you're like, Ooh. Yeah,
exactly. Exactly right. Yeah.

2788
03:04:45,870 --> 03:04:48,110
Well it's a belt.
It's a teeny,

2789
03:04:48,111 --> 03:04:52,490
it's a thin belt that goes through
and click you click the belt,

2790
03:04:52,491 --> 03:04:54,620
make it tight or whatever. It's
like a little mini belt. You don't,

2791
03:04:54,621 --> 03:04:56,270
you don't feel it when you're rolling.
Nothing like that.

2792
03:04:56,630 --> 03:05:00,200
Did you think you're going to feel it
when you were old? It was a question.

2793
03:05:00,270 --> 03:05:02,120
There wasn't enough
thought. I've, you know,

2794
03:05:02,810 --> 03:05:05,320
this seems kind of weird and
then you put it on and you don't,

2795
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,353
you don't notice it.

2796
03:05:06,500 --> 03:05:09,080
You don't notice until it comes time
to take it off and it's so easy. Yeah.

2797
03:05:09,081 --> 03:05:10,820
You're like boom.
And here's the thing again,

2798
03:05:10,821 --> 03:05:15,230
it's like we probably never really
thought of this until you actually do it.

2799
03:05:15,230 --> 03:05:16,550
Like Akron, when you're,
when you're done doing it,

2800
03:05:16,551 --> 03:05:17,510
you don't really think about it,

2801
03:05:17,511 --> 03:05:20,600
but it's just one of those things
where it's like, Dang, this is good,

2802
03:05:20,660 --> 03:05:24,530
these are good, these are good keys.
One of the many details. Yes. Who did,

2803
03:05:24,890 --> 03:05:29,210
I was talking to a guy yesterday,
I was getting interviewed and I said,

2804
03:05:30,580 --> 03:05:34,100
yeah. I said, well, you know, he's asking
me about all my different businesses,

2805
03:05:34,101 --> 03:05:38,910
right? Whatever that means, all
opinion. And I said, well, you know, I,

2806
03:05:39,100 --> 03:05:41,480
I have a apparel company and we make,

2807
03:05:41,840 --> 03:05:46,670
we make apparel up in Maine. Got a
big factory up in Maine. He says, oh,

2808
03:05:46,671 --> 03:05:51,440
up in Maine, that's up in Maine
factory in Maine. And you know what?

2809
03:05:51,500 --> 03:05:54,200
I was like, yeah. And he was all
surprised. And I said, you know what?

2810
03:05:54,620 --> 03:05:58,700
It's sad that you're surprised
at that because 50 years ago,

2811
03:05:59,030 --> 03:06:02,180
everybody knew that that's
where they made stuff.

2812
03:06:02,630 --> 03:06:05,180
They made it up there
and it all disappeared.

2813
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:08,540
And now it's coming back and we're
bringing it back. I told this guy,

2814
03:06:08,830 --> 03:06:10,960
we're bringing it back. We're bringing
back made. In fact, we've got,

2815
03:06:11,090 --> 03:06:13,820
we're weaving material up there.
When you don't know what that,

2816
03:06:13,830 --> 03:06:16,550
we didn't even know what
I'm talking about. People's
first instinct is like, Oh,

2817
03:06:16,551 --> 03:06:18,860
if you want material, you've got to
go to overseas and you got to have,

2818
03:06:19,100 --> 03:06:22,120
you've got to get it, get it made
in some sweatshop somewhere. Right.

2819
03:06:22,121 --> 03:06:25,930
That's literally what, that's, that's,
that's accepted, right. That's accessible.

2820
03:06:25,960 --> 03:06:28,580
Like, Oh, you just, you know, hey, you
can't beat those prices and you can't,

2821
03:06:28,730 --> 03:06:31,910
you can't overcome the, the tariffs
and whatever else. No. You know what?

2822
03:06:31,940 --> 03:06:36,770
Yes you can. Yes you can. And we
are. Yep. We're doing it. Yeah.

2823
03:06:36,890 --> 03:06:38,900
He gets the cotton in like North Carolina.

2824
03:06:39,950 --> 03:06:42,560
You're screwing up South Carolina.

2825
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:45,920
I believe I'm screwing it up
to get the cotton in America.

2826
03:06:45,950 --> 03:06:49,540
One of the current in America. The
thing is that, just talk to peanut,

2827
03:06:49,550 --> 03:06:52,700
I'm pretty sure he said north could
have been south. I don't know. I forget.

2828
03:06:52,950 --> 03:06:56,290
Can I apologize?
Nonetheless it is in just like you said,

2829
03:06:56,550 --> 03:06:59,430
and then they bring it up and
here's what it is. Who the secret.

2830
03:06:59,431 --> 03:07:01,410
They have their looms.
They have their own looms.

2831
03:07:01,810 --> 03:07:04,980
You can't just walk into a store and start
buying looms. You just can't do that.

2832
03:07:04,981 --> 03:07:06,990
That's why it's hard to,
you know, to kind of,

2833
03:07:07,140 --> 03:07:09,870
that's why they have a unique situation
there where it's all made in America.

2834
03:07:10,270 --> 03:07:14,730
Perfect. Everyone that is
supporting us at origin. Thank you.

2835
03:07:14,790 --> 03:07:17,640
Cause right now you know what we're doing.
We're expanding,

2836
03:07:18,300 --> 03:07:19,530
we're buying more machines,

2837
03:07:19,770 --> 03:07:22,740
we're buying better equipment
and we're hiring more people.

2838
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:26,050
So thank you for your
support. It's awesome. We're,

2839
03:07:26,090 --> 03:07:31,090
we're only able to bring manufacturing
back to America because of you knowing

2840
03:07:31,651 --> 03:07:34,470
that you want to have the best and you
want it made America. So thanks everyone.

2841
03:07:35,040 --> 03:07:38,010
Thank you fucking that much appreciated.
But yeah,

2842
03:07:38,011 --> 03:07:42,630
that's the one origin main.com. A lot
of cool stuff on there. Some hoodies,

2843
03:07:42,870 --> 03:07:45,810
not to mention the most comfortable
pants in the world officially now.

2844
03:07:46,080 --> 03:07:50,310
Officially I'm wearing right now. We go to
la today. Good, fine. You know, whatever.

2845
03:07:50,940 --> 03:07:52,290
But you're gonna want to
wear something comfortable.

2846
03:07:52,291 --> 03:07:55,410
This is my thought process before we
went to where the most comfortable thing

2847
03:07:55,411 --> 03:07:59,670
that I own. Straight up. No
question. Me. Origin Pants, boom.

2848
03:08:00,600 --> 03:08:04,050
Anyway, also, like I
said, Geez, rash guards,

2849
03:08:04,080 --> 03:08:06,990
compression gear and whatnot.
Anyway,

2850
03:08:06,991 --> 03:08:10,050
just go there or do you mean.com
get what you want. Also,

2851
03:08:10,051 --> 03:08:13,950
the immersion camps did Jujitsu camp,
you did sue immersion camp,

2852
03:08:13,951 --> 03:08:18,570
not concentration camp. Not,
not a necessarily a summer camp.

2853
03:08:18,820 --> 03:08:20,880
Not Band camp. Not Band camp. No,

2854
03:08:21,300 --> 03:08:24,720
it's like an emerging k immerse yourself
and you did it to you train as much or

2855
03:08:24,721 --> 03:08:28,560
as little as you want, but you get to be
in Jujitsu the whole time. Boom. One week,

2856
03:08:28,561 --> 03:08:32,820
two sessions. You can do both if you
want. By the way, Jack will be there.

2857
03:08:32,940 --> 03:08:36,540
I will be there. Maybe not at full
capacity. That jury's still out of.

2858
03:08:36,541 --> 03:08:39,150
Now we're going to see you
about some stuff. Long story,

2859
03:08:40,590 --> 03:08:45,590
Dave Burke Lafe looks like j p work in it.

2860
03:08:46,950 --> 03:08:51,480
Anyway. A lot of cool fun people will be
there. It's going to be a good good time.

2861
03:08:51,610 --> 03:08:56,190
Um, if last year is any indicators
can be real good time. Also,

2862
03:08:57,840 --> 03:09:02,250
if you want to vary up your workout, you
want to get some kettlebells, like some,

2863
03:09:02,310 --> 03:09:06,160
someone just texted me today. Well
you know, and on DM, right online.

2864
03:09:07,470 --> 03:09:10,290
What weight Kettlebell should
I use? Okay, here's the thing.

2865
03:09:10,320 --> 03:09:15,090
That's a broad question. So who
are you exactly right? Yeah.

2866
03:09:15,290 --> 03:09:19,610
It's an easy answer. I
didn't think so. Order,

2867
03:09:19,650 --> 03:09:24,650
the 48 kilogram ones can potentially
kill yourself or smash it on your tool

2868
03:09:24,801 --> 03:09:28,260
because you can hold it or it's too
light for you. I Dunno. It just depends.

2869
03:09:28,440 --> 03:09:32,120
So it depends on how much you know
about using kettlebells. Defense,

2870
03:09:32,121 --> 03:09:32,720
the how strong you are.

2871
03:09:32,720 --> 03:09:36,750
Depends on how big you are and
it depends on what kind of,

2872
03:09:37,700 --> 03:09:39,720
yeah, no, this kind of, it does. No,

2873
03:09:39,721 --> 03:09:43,350
it depends on what kind of fitness
you're trying to achieve. Yeah, it, yes,

2874
03:09:43,390 --> 03:09:45,870
because goals are trying to get big and
strong or you want to get a bigger crowd

2875
03:09:45,871 --> 03:09:50,850
belt. Yeah. We're trying to get more,
more metcon, conditioning and whatnot.

2876
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:54,130
Then you get maybe a smaller carryable
yeah, maybe medium or something like that.

2877
03:09:54,460 --> 03:09:59,440
The last point is, hey, it depends.
Depends, but here's the thing.

2878
03:09:59,590 --> 03:10:00,401
I will say this,

2879
03:10:00,401 --> 03:10:03,880
I'm gonna say this with complete bias
because I cause the Onnit kettle bells on

2880
03:10:03,881 --> 03:10:07,900
it. Those are the kettle bells you
get regardless of what size you get.

2881
03:10:07,910 --> 03:10:11,380
The artsy primal bell ones,
that's, and that's the one you get.

2882
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:14,140
They're just way cooler.
Also,

2883
03:10:15,220 --> 03:10:19,720
if you want to vary. We were work.
Like I said, no boring workouts.

2884
03:10:20,500 --> 03:10:23,620
Jocko doesn't have borne
workouts apparently thought
he did. He doesn't. I know.

2885
03:10:23,890 --> 03:10:27,520
But do you want to make your workouts
interesting? Different movements,

2886
03:10:27,521 --> 03:10:30,460
functional strength and actual strength.

2887
03:10:30,880 --> 03:10:33,670
There's other stuff on there starting
with like, oh it's a spectrum.

2888
03:10:33,671 --> 03:10:38,671
It goes from jump ropes all the way up
to mate steel bells with the steel bell.

2889
03:10:39,860 --> 03:10:42,460
They look like a Frisbee. Right.
But there's filled with metal.

2890
03:10:42,490 --> 03:10:45,610
But would he do with them? All kinds
of stuff. Right. You see there,

2891
03:10:45,611 --> 03:10:48,100
that's the point. So there's a
bunch of stuff on there anyway.

2892
03:10:48,101 --> 03:10:51,760
A lot of good stuff. Let a, um, what
did I just get that were pretty cool?

2893
03:10:51,780 --> 03:10:56,440
Oh the stocks boom on it. Socks on
it straight up. So there's a lot of,

2894
03:10:56,490 --> 03:10:59,350
a lot of cool stuff on there on there.
A lot of good information on there too.

2895
03:10:59,351 --> 03:11:02,470
So a lot of the questions that are
directed at me, I don't know the answer.

2896
03:11:02,860 --> 03:11:06,280
I sometimes don't know the answer for
me as opposed to me. Some stuff I heard,

2897
03:11:06,281 --> 03:11:07,840
but it's real flimsy a lot of the time.

2898
03:11:08,340 --> 03:11:10,930
You got a on it and let
information on there, so get some,

2899
03:11:11,080 --> 03:11:15,010
as they say on it.com/jocko good way
to support. If you want something,

2900
03:11:15,011 --> 03:11:18,370
get something. Also, when you get these
books that Jocko reviews, sometimes

2901
03:11:20,350 --> 03:11:25,180
Hackworth books about face. Good
one, steal my soldiers hearts.

2902
03:11:25,750 --> 03:11:29,470
Good on any of the books.
Feel the need to get one.

2903
03:11:29,471 --> 03:11:32,170
Hate to wherein it organized
all the books by episode Jocko,

2904
03:11:32,171 --> 03:11:37,050
podcast.com go Jocko, podcast.com click
on the top books from episodes. Boom,

2905
03:11:37,060 --> 03:11:40,930
I got them organized perfectly.
Click through there. Get your book,

2906
03:11:41,710 --> 03:11:45,160
get whatever book you want to
get. Two books, get a leaf.
Lord, just continue. Shit.

2907
03:11:45,161 --> 03:11:48,310
Just go. Just do your Amazon thing and
you're all good. Good way to support.

2908
03:11:48,370 --> 03:11:53,110
Also subscribe to the podcast. If you

to the podcast, what I'm saying,

2911
03:12:01,180 --> 03:12:04,570
that's kind of the thing. Regardless of
what podcast application you're using,

2912
03:12:04,730 --> 03:12:08,140
it's good way to support the review if
you're in the mood to just leave a review.

2913
03:12:08,920 --> 03:12:11,310
You know when you kind of think about it,
if you're not in the mood to lever,

2914
03:12:11,311 --> 03:12:16,210
if you, I don't even know
if it's conducive to leave
a review or is it, I dunno.

2915
03:12:16,330 --> 03:12:19,330
I said go for it. Yeah. I
say go for it. BTF BTF right.

2916
03:12:20,470 --> 03:12:25,360
I say if you're in the mood, leave review
to you. Also, we have a youtube channel.

2917
03:12:25,390 --> 03:12:27,100
If you didn't already the
subscribed to that one.

2918
03:12:27,101 --> 03:12:30,340
That's a good way to support as well.
We have excerpts on there.

2919
03:12:30,750 --> 03:12:33,730
Try to post every day.
Try to sometimes two a day.

2920
03:12:33,830 --> 03:12:38,830
Try to also on there is enhanced excerpts.

2921
03:12:39,700 --> 03:12:41,680
You know what I mean by that?
I know what you mean by

2922
03:12:43,900 --> 03:12:48,900
cinematography into the scenarios you
film and then you edit with music and

2923
03:12:49,391 --> 03:12:53,510
other special effects, CGI and
whatnot. Sure. Well at the very least,

2924
03:12:53,511 --> 03:12:54,940
I'll put some music on there.
You know,

2925
03:12:54,960 --> 03:12:58,850
making things are exploding sometimes.

2926
03:12:59,380 --> 03:13:01,590
Sometimes you read it,
the warpath videos,

2927
03:13:01,591 --> 03:13:05,120
so there's no longer a horrible
Christmas. No is a deliverable. See,

2928
03:13:05,121 --> 03:13:07,440
I'd put Christmas music on that
cause it was Christmas time.

2929
03:13:08,150 --> 03:13:10,760
Don't ever do that again.
You want to get Christmas spirit,

2930
03:13:10,761 --> 03:13:15,320
watch the watch the Christmas 1914 video.
That's a good one as well.

2931
03:13:15,400 --> 03:13:19,510
And that's better Christmas spirit
is real Christmas spirit. Yeah.

2932
03:13:20,240 --> 03:13:23,280
Nonetheless. That's why I did it. But
look, you make a good point. Hey, what?

2933
03:13:23,290 --> 03:13:27,770
Whatever. You never put Christmas
music and one of my, uh,

2934
03:13:27,771 --> 03:13:31,020
what do they call excerpts?
Oh, now that yours. Okay.

2935
03:13:33,980 --> 03:13:35,960
If I'm in it,

2936
03:13:37,130 --> 03:13:41,180
please don't put Christmas
music in our excerpts.

2937
03:13:41,980 --> 03:13:46,910
You got it. I promise. Yeah,
I got to take down actually.

2938
03:13:46,911 --> 03:13:48,560
All right. Hey, I dig it and you know,

2939
03:13:48,561 --> 03:13:51,280
thought he's not going to be Christmas
every day. The wise man once said,

2940
03:13:51,281 --> 03:13:52,340
it's not Christmas every day.

2941
03:13:52,400 --> 03:13:56,360
So why put Christmas music on something
that someone might may or may not listen

2942
03:13:56,361 --> 03:14:00,860
to every day? So I understand. So yeah.
Or we did it, you know, revamp some stuff,

2943
03:14:00,861 --> 03:14:01,521
sometimes stuff.

2944
03:14:01,521 --> 03:14:04,580
Put some different music on that if
you want to listen to it everyday. Fyi,

2945
03:14:04,581 --> 03:14:09,270
my wife completely stuck up for
you on that one. Yeah. Because, oh,

2946
03:14:09,280 --> 03:14:13,940
it's nice Christmas music. It was
released at Christmas time. Okay.

2947
03:14:13,941 --> 03:14:15,350
I just went into like hiding.

2948
03:14:15,950 --> 03:14:18,500
It was kind of a bummer too
because that was a really,

2949
03:14:18,770 --> 03:14:21,330
I know you put a lot of time and effort
into that video. Took a lot of word.

2950
03:14:21,360 --> 03:14:23,060
So good.
So then when you showed it to me,

2951
03:14:23,830 --> 03:14:26,400
you were all excited and,

2952
03:14:27,180 --> 03:14:29,990
and the video CGI stuff is awesome.
Right?

2953
03:14:30,380 --> 03:14:34,470
But I know that you wanted me to be just,
you know,

2954
03:14:35,150 --> 03:14:40,150
over the top with filled with awe at
the video and I was with the visuals,

2955
03:14:43,610 --> 03:14:48,230
but I was, that was a lot of that
was countered by Christmas songs,

2956
03:14:48,530 --> 03:14:51,830
music. And so what you saw from
my reaction was actually fake,

2957
03:14:53,240 --> 03:14:56,240
fairly fate. There was a fair amount
of realness and there, let me tell you,

2958
03:14:56,241 --> 03:14:58,580
cause here, and I remember it and
I won't forget it cause you were,

2959
03:14:58,790 --> 03:14:59,490
cause you know,

2960
03:14:59,490 --> 03:15:04,490
you go a little bit insight where you
all kind of like form it where it does

2961
03:15:05,641 --> 03:15:08,720
like a certain thing and then it'll drop
off then, then I'll come back, whatever.

2962
03:15:09,140 --> 03:15:12,620
So there's this part where the certain
parts starts that I'm like, oh he's gonna,

2963
03:15:12,650 --> 03:15:14,570
he's gonna kind of like that
part. Right. So I'm kind of,

2964
03:15:14,571 --> 03:15:17,120
so I kind of look over at
you if I know super childish,

2965
03:15:17,121 --> 03:15:20,450
but I'm like looking at you or whatever
and you're like looking at it and then

2966
03:15:20,451 --> 03:15:24,130
like when that part hit and it's
Christmas music, you're like, hmm.

2967
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:28,720
Like as if to say interesting
choice instead of, you know.

2968
03:15:33,170 --> 03:15:37,790
Anyway, so rough. We changed
the Christmas music as a result.

2969
03:15:37,791 --> 03:15:40,880
So bowl anyway,
one of the biggest hit video of all time.

2970
03:15:42,710 --> 03:15:45,260
Anyway. Yeah. So yeah, enhance
excerpts. That's what's on there.

2971
03:15:45,290 --> 03:15:48,170
Along with of course,
the video version of this podcast,

2972
03:15:48,200 --> 03:15:52,350
if you care what y'all call looks like.
Also jock was a store,

2973
03:15:52,550 --> 03:15:56,250
it's called Jacqueline store.
Url Is Jacqueline, store.com.

2974
03:15:56,420 --> 03:15:59,070
It's a website obviously.
I know not that creative,

2975
03:15:59,071 --> 03:16:02,370
but still cool stuff on there
and stuff is creative I think.

2976
03:16:02,371 --> 03:16:06,930
So go on their shirts,
hats. We even got a new hat.

2977
03:16:07,110 --> 03:16:11,790
It's like a flex fit now. Boom. Lot of
people been asking for that delivered.

2978
03:16:13,410 --> 03:16:16,950
Gladly delivered anyway, who he's
on there. Like I said, rash guards,

2979
03:16:18,600 --> 03:16:22,800
women's stuff, some new mugs.
You know what? I think I'm
putting the tea on there.

2980
03:16:22,830 --> 03:16:24,420
So if you know,

2981
03:16:24,421 --> 03:16:29,100
if they want to have that option to
get Jocko white tea and international,

2982
03:16:29,130 --> 03:16:31,800
you know, Oh yeah. I think, do
you know, just more options,

2983
03:16:32,040 --> 03:16:35,940
more convenient for the people call
for everybody. I think nonetheless,

2984
03:16:36,350 --> 03:16:40,050
a lot of stuff on there. Uh, if
you want something, get something.

2985
03:16:41,130 --> 03:16:43,890
Also psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

2986
03:16:43,891 --> 03:16:48,840
it's an album with tracks.
Jocko tracks.

2987
03:16:49,890 --> 03:16:52,530
I know that sounds like, okay. It's
kind of esoteric. Jocko tracks.

2988
03:16:52,531 --> 03:16:53,880
Was that mean here?
This is what it means.

2989
03:16:53,910 --> 03:16:58,170
It means it's not in him seeing nothing
like that. So in your mom, in your,

2990
03:16:58,230 --> 03:17:02,100
in your campaign against weakness
and we're all in the pack straight,

2991
03:17:02,120 --> 03:17:05,790
it's like common knowledge are they, all
of us were on the path. Like if you're,

2992
03:17:05,910 --> 03:17:08,490
if we're listening to this, even
me talking to you, listen to me.

2993
03:17:08,491 --> 03:17:13,440
We're on the path. All of us on
group now, this is inevitable,

2994
03:17:13,500 --> 03:17:15,900
I think for the most part. Inevitable.
Where are you going to hit?

2995
03:17:15,900 --> 03:17:17,400
Moments of weakness.

2996
03:17:18,330 --> 03:17:20,850
Sometimes you need a little help
through those moments of weakness.

2997
03:17:20,851 --> 03:17:25,470
Sometimes you need to just slip in those
moments of weakness and fall and be

2998
03:17:25,471 --> 03:17:29,490
like, I'm not doing that again. Sometimes
that's useful. You learn in my opinion,

2999
03:17:29,790 --> 03:17:32,790
but in those moments of weakness
where you just need a little spot,

3000
03:17:32,970 --> 03:17:37,520
this is what Jocko tracks or for,
so let's say your weaknesses,

3001
03:17:37,530 --> 03:17:41,610
not getting up early. You want to hit the
snooze switch, you want to do too tired.

3002
03:17:41,611 --> 03:17:44,910
I don't know. Whatever. Maybe
drink a little bit. I don't know.

3003
03:17:46,080 --> 03:17:48,330
So you're on the fence, you're like, I'm
gonna hit this news just for, for what?

3004
03:17:48,360 --> 03:17:51,450
What? What's a normal snooze? 10
minutes, nine minutes, whatever.

3005
03:17:51,710 --> 03:17:54,570
I don't know what I'm saying.
You have to tell me about that.

3006
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:02,310
Anyway, actually it's
not fourth. The snooze,

3007
03:18:02,311 --> 03:18:05,580
technically it's not for hitting the
snooze, it's for going back to bed.

3008
03:18:05,760 --> 03:18:08,860
That's the weakness that this
particular track cause hitting this new.

3009
03:18:08,870 --> 03:18:11,910
This is like if you,
if you just want to hit the snooze,

3010
03:18:11,911 --> 03:18:15,210
you're not going to have the energy
to get up and you know, boom.

3011
03:18:15,360 --> 03:18:17,990
Maybe if you put it as your alarm.
Nonetheless, this is what is the track it,

3012
03:18:18,060 --> 03:18:18,751
it's jock.

3013
03:18:18,751 --> 03:18:21,680
On a specific track telling you why
you should just get up and not hit the

3014
03:18:21,681 --> 03:18:26,490
snooze or not staying bid. But it's
like Jocko pragmatic advice. It's good.

3015
03:18:27,270 --> 03:18:31,170
100% and this goes for a diet stuff.
Skipping workout stuff.

3016
03:18:31,860 --> 03:18:35,490
Hundred percent effectiveness,
hundred percent that's good.

3017
03:18:35,700 --> 03:18:40,700
Speaking of 100% if you
100% 100% guaranteed,

3018
03:18:41,260 --> 03:18:45,300
want to be able to deadlift 8,000
pounds minimum, you might go over that.

3019
03:18:46,110 --> 03:18:49,370
All you have to do is drink Jocko
tea. Is that it? Simple, bro. Okay.

3020
03:18:49,660 --> 03:18:52,610
And the kids are going to get sued.

3021
03:18:52,611 --> 03:18:57,020
Am I going to get sued for false
advertising? No, because, and here's why.

3022
03:18:57,021 --> 03:19:00,680
So this good. Josiah is this big
huge guy tore his bicep by the way,

3023
03:19:01,310 --> 03:19:04,190
a few weeks ago, maybe a few months
ago. It's been probably a few months.

3024
03:19:04,400 --> 03:19:08,660
And the last big guy, dead lifts, you
know, has the setup right? And, and he'll,

3025
03:19:08,690 --> 03:19:09,650
he'll have videos there.

3026
03:19:09,710 --> 03:19:14,660
I watch them just understanding what we
can and so he turns his Bicep, you know,

3027
03:19:15,710 --> 03:19:19,610
it happens. And so
heat, there's the video.

3028
03:19:19,970 --> 03:19:24,110
Actually I think this video is before
he tore the bicep. No, no it was after.

3029
03:19:24,290 --> 03:19:28,370
So he has his arm in a sling.
Right when you have the bicep tear.

3030
03:19:29,210 --> 03:19:33,020
So he drinks some Jocko
white tea with the 10 pounds.

3031
03:19:33,021 --> 03:19:36,620
It any smashes the tin and I'm not joking.

3032
03:19:36,710 --> 03:19:41,300
The actual video smashes 10 throws
the 10 dead lifts. One bad arm,

3033
03:19:41,301 --> 03:19:44,570
one hand. And it's like more than I
can deadlift for real in real life.

3034
03:19:44,620 --> 03:19:48,020
The one hand deadlift,
so boom, proof proof.

3035
03:19:48,021 --> 03:19:50,210
See what I'm saying by
way of Video Josiah?

3036
03:19:50,370 --> 03:19:55,080
Yeah, that it is. You can
get that on Amazon soon.

3037
03:19:55,320 --> 03:19:57,540
Very soon. We're, I
shouldn't say very soon.

3038
03:19:58,350 --> 03:20:03,350
Within a few weeks you're going to be
able to get readymade Jocko white tea in a

3039
03:20:03,641 --> 03:20:07,620
cam. We're going to put some
companies out of business.

3040
03:20:08,160 --> 03:20:11,640
Yeah. Cause you're going to be at
seven 11 gone. Oh you know what? Oh,

3041
03:20:11,641 --> 03:20:14,280
maybe I'll have the sugar filled thing
over here and it will make me feel like,

3042
03:20:15,090 --> 03:20:18,240
like, like high on a sugar high
for about 15 minutes and I want to,

3043
03:20:18,570 --> 03:20:21,960
they don't want to fall asleep and be
lame and I'll be getting diabetes or I can

3044
03:20:21,961 --> 03:20:25,530
have drove away change and let this
car. So anyways, yeah, that's common.

3045
03:20:25,710 --> 03:20:27,630
That's common.
I'll let you all know when that's out.

3046
03:20:27,810 --> 03:20:30,510
Hey books way the warrior kid series

3047
03:20:32,280 --> 03:20:34,710

and discipline to kids.

03:20:34,890 --> 03:20:39,270
Book two is out now it's called Mark's
mission. Teach your kids to be stronger,

3049

03:20:41,700 --> 03:20:44,730

perspective on other people.

and physical bullying.

Yeah. Teach them to be a warrior
kids and speaking to more your kids.

3053
03:20:53,071 --> 03:20:54,990
If you want to support a warrior kid,

3054
03:20:54,991 --> 03:20:59,991
go to Irish oaks ranch.com and get some
or your kids soap made by Aiden who's 13

3055
03:21:02,431 --> 03:21:05,880
years old, owns his own business
chocolate. So yeah, he makes Jocko soap.

3056
03:21:06,270 --> 03:21:09,240
It's good to use if
you want to stay clean,

3057
03:21:11,850 --> 03:21:14,280
don't forget about the discipline
equals freedom field manual.

3058
03:21:15,630 --> 03:21:19,620
And you know what this is. This is good.
Read, read. Just read one section a day.

3059
03:21:20,580 --> 03:21:20,940
Okay.

3060
03:21:20,940 --> 03:21:25,470
Legit. Read one section a day that
will legitimately keep you on the path.

3061
03:21:26,880 --> 03:21:28,370
Try it. You're right. Yeah.

3062
03:21:29,650 --> 03:21:32,290
If you want to listen to one
track a day instead of read it,

3063
03:21:33,160 --> 03:21:36,340
cause maybe do it in the car
or whatever is not on audible.

3064
03:21:37,450 --> 03:21:42,130
It's on MP3, the disparate calls,
freedom field, manual, iTunes,

3065
03:21:42,220 --> 03:21:43,780
Amazon music,
Google play,

3066
03:21:44,200 --> 03:21:48,680
wherever you can listen to MP three
s of course there's leadership book,

3067
03:21:49,190 --> 03:21:49,881
extreme ownership,

3068
03:21:49,881 --> 03:21:53,360
combat leadership and how to apply it
to your business and life over a million

3069
03:21:53,361 --> 03:21:55,670
copies of that have sold.
That's a lot.

3070
03:21:56,270 --> 03:21:59,450
And is not because we did
a big advertising campaign.

3071
03:22:00,390 --> 03:22:04,370
There's not because we took out an
advertisement in the Superbowl series. No,

3072
03:22:04,790 --> 03:22:08,840
it's because of word of mouth. That's
why people read it because it works.

3073
03:22:09,020 --> 03:22:12,860
So get that for your business in life
and actually if you want to now order the

3074
03:22:12,861 --> 03:22:14,690
follow on book two extreme ownership.

3075
03:22:14,720 --> 03:22:17,870
It's called the dichotomy of leadership
life and I just finished writing it.

3076
03:22:19,220 --> 03:22:21,560
This book will,
it's really going to help leaders.

3077
03:22:21,561 --> 03:22:23,300
I can't wait to get it out
there into people's hands.

3078
03:22:23,750 --> 03:22:27,560
One of the hardest things to do as
leaders is find a balance between all the

3079
03:22:27,561 --> 03:22:32,510
dichotomies of leadership. And this
will help you do that. Order it now.

3080
03:22:33,230 --> 03:22:34,490
Otherwise the same thing's gonna happen.

3081
03:22:34,550 --> 03:22:37,610
Publishers won't have a copy for you
and you're gonna be mad and I'll be mad.

3082
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:38,900

you can't come to that one.

3090
03:23:09,590 --> 03:23:14,570

That is the next muster.
And also at the muster,

3092
03:23:18,111 --> 03:23:23,111

room clearing our minds in an isolation

3093
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:27,710
float tank.
We will not be doing that.

3094

We will be with you out there the whole
time. Talking, answering questions,
