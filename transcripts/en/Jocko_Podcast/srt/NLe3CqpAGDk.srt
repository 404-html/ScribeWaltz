00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
This is Jocko podcast number
38 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,373
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,810
Okay,

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,570
foot, foot, slogging over Africa,

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,010
boots, boots, boots, boots. Yeah.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,510
Moving up and down again.
There's no discharge in the war.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,230
Six, seven, 11 five,

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,350
nine and 20 mile today for
11 1732 the day before,

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,030
boots, boots, boots, boots,

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,190
moving up and down again.
There's no discharge in the war.

13
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,680
Don't, don't, don't, don't
look at what's in front of you.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,780
Boots, boots, boots, boots.

15
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,560
Moving up and down again.
Men, men, men, men.

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,180
Men will go mad with watching them
and there's no discharge in the war.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,630
Try, try, try, try to think
of something different.

18
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,440
Oh my God.
Keep me from him.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,620
Go in. Lunatic boots, boots, boots, boots.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,790
Moving up and down again.
There's no discharge in the war.

21
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,920
Count, count, count, count
the bullets in the bandoliers.

22
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,450
If your eyes drop,
they will get on top of you.

23
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,130
Boots, boots, boots, boots,
moving up and down again.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,620
There is no discharge in the war.

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,690
We can stick out hunger,
thirst, and wariness,

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,370
but not, not, not, not
the chronic side of them.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,250
Boats, boats, boats, boats,

28
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,660
moving up and down again and
there's no discharge in the wall.

29
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,520
Tanked so bad by day because a company,

30
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:05,521
but knight brings long strings
of 40,000 million boots,

31
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,820
boots, boots, boots,
moving up and down again.

32
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,340
There's no discharge in the war.

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,300
I have marched six weeks
and Helen said a Phi,

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,150
it's not fire devils dark or anything,
but boots,

35
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,400
boots, boots, boots,

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,870
moving up and down again and
there's no discharge in the wall.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,240
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

38
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:42,590
Okay.

39
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,200
That's a poem.
That's a poem

40
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,410
called infantry columns by Kipling.

41
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,800
Rudyard Kipling.

42
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,470
Okay.

43
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,260
Who we've actually read before
on the podcast, he was a

44
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,790
British correspondent. He
was an author. He was a poet.

45
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,420
He was a patriot,
a British patriot,

46
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,190
and he was actually also critical of war

47
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,020
and paraphrased from a book
by a guy named David Gilmore.

48
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:25,210
The long recessional,
the imperial life of Richard Kipling.

49
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,950
Kipling was deeply critical of how
the war was fought. And by the way,

50
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:33,370
he's talking about world war one of how
the war was fought by the British army

51
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:37,120
as opposed to the war itself,
which is kind of like Hackworth.

52
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,720
Hackworth was more opposed to the
way we were fighting in Vietnam.

53
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,850
Then he was opposed to
the actual war itself.

54
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,773
Hm.

55
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,060
And he complained is early.

56
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:54,230
This is Kipling complaint as early as
October of 1914 that Germany should have

57
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:58,760
been defeated by now. Then something
must be wrong with the British army.

58
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,870
Kipling was shocked by the heavy losses
that the British expeditionary force had

59
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,630
taken by the autumn of 1914 and blame
the entire prewar generation of British

60
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:16,601
politicians who he had argued failed
to learn the lessons of the bu or war.

61
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,570
And as a result,

62
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,640
thousands and thousands of British
soldiers were paying with their lives

63
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,530
for failures in the fields.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And so there's some definite complexities
to Kipling and it actually goes a

65
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:39,450
little bit further and deeper
with these complexities.

66
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:42,120
And there's a reason I
started off with that poem.

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,533
Yeah.

68
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,350
And that poem,
it is

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,600
pretty much attributed that that
the, the, the ID of that poem,

70
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:59,430
which is obviously about marching long
distances and it's attributed to a series

71
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:04,380
of forced marches that were
led by in the Boer war,

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,360
which were led by Field Marshal,
Lord Frederick Roberts,

73
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,380
who led 60,000 men on forced marches
during the second bu or war in South

74
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,290
Africa. He let these forced marches
that were almost a thousand miles,

75
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,280
950 miles from Cape Down to Transvaal.
Okay.

76
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,920
And so that's kind of weird.
This,

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,950
this poem comes from about how maddening
it is to march in how hard it is.

78
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,660
But the interesting, the other interesting
piece of this is that Lord Robert,

79
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,650
Rob,
Lord Roberts,

80
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,970
who led this March was actually
personal friends with Kipling.

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,990
They were,
they were close friends and

82
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,980
Lord Roberts was commander in chief
of the army during World War One.

83
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,700
And at Kipling's request at root,

84
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,580
your Kipling's request,

85
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,870
Lord Roberts allowed Kipling's son to
be admitted to join the Irish guard.

86
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,970
He had some kind of a health problem.

87
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,080
And so Kipling Rudyard Kipling
called him up and said, hey,

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,840
my son's got a health issue,
but he needs to get in the game.

89
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,070
And Lord Roberts worked it out,
you know,

90
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:26,870
commander in chief of the army and got
him, had him admitted to the Irish guards.

91
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,210
It was actually his eyesight.
He had poor eyesight.

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,270
And so the,

93
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,170
okay,

94
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,590
the horrible piece I guess of that is
that, as I mentioned the first time

95
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,740
we read a Kipling poem on here
is that Rudyard Kipling son.

96
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,130
Yeah,

97
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:51,130
John Kipling was killed in September
of 1915 at the battle of loos where the

98
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:54,050
bro,

99
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,050
the British suffered 60,000 casualties
in three weeks of fighting's 60,000

100
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:03,434
casualties.

101
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,850
His body was never identified

102
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,420
and he is one of the 20,000
British dead that are corrupt,

103
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:16,150
commemorated by the Lou's memorial.

104
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,950
And while his body was never found,

105
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,110
there were accounts

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,200
that he was last seen slogging through
the mud blindly after a violent shell

107
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,240
explosion had ripped off his face.

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
And there's further connections.

109
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:49,060
And one of the lines in the poem is
that there's no discharge in the war.

110
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,800
Then this is actually from the Bible.
ECCLESIASTES,

111
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:58,801
Ds eight eight says there is no man that
hath power over the spirit to retain

112
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:00,484
the spirit.

113
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,180
Neither half he power in the day of death
and there is no discharge in that war.

114
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,820
So what he's saying there is

115
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,880
no man have powers to power over the
spirit to retain spirit. Meaning you,

116
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:20,180
you can't keep your soul when it's,
when it's time for your soul to go.

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,073
You can't keep it.

118
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,250
And then neither half the
power over the day of death.

119
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:28,250
Obviously you have no
power to overcome death

120
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,450
and there is no discharge in that war.

121
00:08:32,451 --> 00:08:35,870
And that is that this ultimate struggle.

122
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,620
Yeah,

123
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,750
between life and death.

124
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,430
That war that we fight for life itself,
there's no escape.

125
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,230
Yeah,

126
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,490
you can't get out of it.

127
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,810
There is no discharge from that war

128
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,033
and

129
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,030
[inaudible] maybe a little
heavy way to start the podcast,

130
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,340
but that poem also has a special meaning
to a certain group of people in the

131
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:09,060
navy. And those of you that know
what I'm talking about there,

132
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:13,660
you know what I'm talking about there.
And it's a poem

133
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,620
that I thought of often in my career,

134
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,130
especially when I strapped on my gear
and heave dawn overloaded ruck sack for a

135
00:09:24,311 --> 00:09:27,700
long patrol or march.
And when you do that,

136
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,720
any soldier, a military man will
tell you this, that when you do that,

137
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,970
that is one of the most demanding
parts of the job. The ruck March,

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,530
the long patrol, the hump, a little walk,

139
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,490
the forest road march. And even
though you're with a group of people,

140
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:51,510
when you do that,

141
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,420
when you're marching,
you're very much alone.

142
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,160
You're alone with your
thoughts and there's things
that you got to think about.

143
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,720
You've got to think
about your field of fire.

144
00:10:05,721 --> 00:10:08,900
You got to think about your navigation,
you've got to think about rally point.

145
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,480
You've got to think about head count,
you gotta think about terrain feature.

146
00:10:11,481 --> 00:10:14,990
You've got to think about the enemy and
booby traps and ids and all that stuff.

147
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,450
But even with that,

148
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,120
there's still a lot of empty
space to fill up inside your head.

149
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,980
And I recently

150
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,260
took my kids out on patrol and I
guess to be grammatically correct,

151
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,430
it was a hike in the civilian world,

152
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,840
but in my mind it was a patrol.
It felt like a patrol

153
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,760
and you know, it's

154
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,140
the same thing. I mean essentially
you're moving from point a to point B.

155
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,410
You said security. When you get
there, you set your layup point,

156
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,660
which civilians call like a campsite.

157
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,560
Then you sleep and then you wake
up and then you do it again.

158
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,070
And as I did that patrol,

159
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,940
and since it had been a while since I
had done a patrol and because I was also

160
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:11,910
watching my kids on their first patrol.

161
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,700
Yeah,

162
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,700
I got to kind of revisit my
little relationship that I
have with patrolling over

163
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:20,714
the years.

164
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,673
And

165
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,880
also as I saw them suffer and
learn through their first patrol,

166
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,550
I got to thinking to everything that I'd
learned over the years from patrolling.

167
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,960
And in doing that I realized how
much patrolling had Tommy. So I'm,

168
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:49,410
I'm there, I'm walking and I'm thinking
about all these things that I learned.

169
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:51,300
Because again, when you're
patrolling, you got time.

170
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,010
Even if even if you're thinking about
navigation, you're thinking about

171
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,180
all these things,
it doesn't matter.

172
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:59,380
Even every piece of the job that
you're focused on, it doesn't matter.

173
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,690
There's still space to fill. And
that's what happened. My, you know,

174
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:06,370
your mind starts to think about all
these things and it dawned on me how much

175
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,120
patrolling and marching had taught me
in and how it's really a fundamental

176
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:17,620
component in everything that I did
in the seal teams in the military.

177
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,290
Okay.

178
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,730
And like leadership,

179
00:12:20,731 --> 00:12:25,050
there's some fundamental principles that
apply universally to so many things in

180
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:29,190
life. And also just like leadership.

181
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:34,191
There's a certain aspect of patrolling
in navigation that is as much art as it

182
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:36,450
is science.

183
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,520
And the science of course
is relatively easy to teach,

184
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,370
but the art
as always,

185
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,810
the art is hard to teach.
And finally with this,

186
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,040
this idea of navigation of
moving from point a to point B,

187
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,090
which includes plotting a course and
picking way points along the way and

188
00:12:59,091 --> 00:13:03,890
identifying it and avoiding obstacles
in route and how to overcome the

189
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:08,450
unexpected obstacles and how and when
and where to rest. And everything else.

190
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:13,451
That navigation at patrolling includes
and all those things are things that you

191
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,930
face as you navigate a life.

192
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,350
And as you set goals,
as you establish

193
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,060
where you're going.

194
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,080
So I wanted to take a closer look at
land navigation and how it relates to

195
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,110
leadership and life. And
in digging in, I looked at,

196
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,710
I looked at some of the
information out there, some of the,

197
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,130
some of the field manuals and

198
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,270
yeah,

199
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,500
it's,
it's

200
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,070
okay.

201
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,700
I learned from people, right.
And I didn't learn from a book.

202
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:56,750
And as I winter to the books,

203
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,660
I was coping that I could find what
I had learned from people. But,

204
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,370
but I didn't really find it.
I found pieces of it,

205
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,953
glimpses of it,

206
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,330
but nothing like what I was taught by the
guys that raised me in the seal teams.

207
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,430
And you know, I looked up the
uh, Army FM three tech 25. Dot.

208
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,890
Two six map reading and land navigation.

209
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,590
It's a thorough document and it's very
heavily heavy on the scientific side,

210
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,130
but the actual technical skill of it,

211
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,940
like how to set declination at a compass
and how to work at the map and under

212
00:14:31,941 --> 00:14:34,160
what the contour line.
All the basic tools are in there.

213
00:14:34,161 --> 00:14:38,450
And there's some good quotes and
one of the quotes it said today,

214
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:42,530
the complexities of tactical operations
and deployment of troops are such that

215
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:46,880
it is essential for all soldiers to be
able to read and interpret their maps in

216
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:49,970
order to move quickly and
effectively on the battlefield. Okay?

217
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:52,040
Can't argue with that.
You got

218
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,840
to know where you are.
And if you ever heard me say this,

219
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,840
I always used to ask the uh, the
young, the young seal officers,

220
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:02,360
what's the most important piece of
information you need on the battlefield?

221
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,130
And they would say where the bad guys
are or how many guys you have or how many

222
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:10,340
enemy there are or, or anything like that.
They'd have a bunch of different ideas.

223
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,890
And I would say, no, no, no, no, no.

224
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,370
The most important piece of information
you can have on the battlefield is aware

225
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,170
you are, you got to know where you
are otherwise nothing else matters.

226
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,780
And then I looked at a book
called the last hundred yards,

227
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:30,890
which we actually covered on this podcast,
podcast number three.

228
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,280
And it goes through a
section which is describing,

229
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,730
is talking about gps and
how now we've got gps is,

230
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,940
and the GPS is can be unreliable and you
can't count on them and all this stuff.

231
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,450
And it's kind of true. It was even
more true when that book came out,

232
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:51,500
which was in 1995 and there
was less satellites in the
sky and the gps receivers

233
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:54,560
weren't as good. And the encryption
methodology wasn't so dialed in yet.

234
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,000
So the GPS is,
we're less accurate back then.

235
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,680
And they were also still pretty big.
They were these big contraptions.

236
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,980
And even in 1993 1994 the GPS is
that I carried or big heavy things.

237
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,090
Basically you had to assign
a person to carry them.

238
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,890
And now of course they're tiny.
They're, you know, everybody's got, um,

239
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,200
you know what gps and you're on your
iPhone or whatever smartphone you're using

240
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:27,500
that are a thousand times better than
the one I used to carry on my back.

241
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,270
And they're also very accurate and
reliable. Now in the military's comed up,

242
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,300
rely heavily on them,

243
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,930
perhaps perhaps a little too much.

244
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,130
And I'm not going to be a guy that's
like a stick in the mud that says, hey,

245
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:44,060
don't evolve,

246
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:47,420
don't learn anything because technology
is awesome and you have to take

247
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,254
advantage of it.

248
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,530
But I also do think there's a
need to remember the old ways.

249
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,820
And I remember when gps first came out
and I was coming into the seal team and

250
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:05,450
they had this thing and I remember this,
this officer's would,

251
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,940
this officer's particular
said to me, you know, hey,

252
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:12,860
all I need to do is see all we need to
do is carry this thing and, and you know,

253
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:16,520
we'll know exactly where we are at all
times. Then he hands me this, you know,

254
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,521
20 pound brick but big box
thing and are kind of said,

255
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,113
hey man,

256
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,940
all I need to do is carry this map and
compass and I'll know exactly where I am

257
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:29,870
at all times. It's called land
navigation. I want to learn it.

258
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,490
But nowadays, uh, the GPS is,

259
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:38,180
are awesome and we definitely
rely heavily on them. But,

260
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,620
but it is,

261
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,580
it is piece of the last hundred yards
that definitely emphasizes that you have

262
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:47,450
to know how to Land Nav,
which is good.

263
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,970
But like I said,
when I looked through these books,

264
00:17:50,971 --> 00:17:55,971
none of them gave me this same clear
level of instruction that I learned about

265
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,410
land navigation. It patrolling
when I first got into the teams

266
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,710
back in the day.

267
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,580
And again,

268
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:11,180
these instructions in this methodology
and some of these basic principles of

269
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,590
patrolling and Land Nav,

270
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:17,591
they stuck with me and are
really fundamental building
blocks of how I ended up

271
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:19,844
doing everything that I do.

272
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:26,510
And they're really the basis
of the attitude that I had
that was very beneficial

273
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,560
and leading me to having success
in other areas, which was awesome.

274
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,570
And so again,

275
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:41,571
here I am and taking my kids on their
first patrol that made me realize this so

276
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:44,600
clearly. And as I was thinking
about, I was like, you know,

277
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,930
I'm going to talk about
this on the podcast.

278
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,200
Okay.

279
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,160
Because these are lessons that I learned
that I actually forgot that I learned.

280
00:18:52,161 --> 00:18:52,611
You know what I mean?

281
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:56,930
These are lessons that are so embedded
that I forgot that I thought about them,

282
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,320
but I think about them all the time
and then not seeing my kids do this.

283
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,870
I'm thinking, Oh yeah, there they are.

284
00:19:02,871 --> 00:19:06,020
They're learning this right
now for the first time. And so

285
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,850
to go through some of those things,
some of those principles,

286
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,970
the first one is planning and you know,

287
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,570
we, we, this gets every,

288
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:19,220
of course everyone knows you've
got to come up with a plan,

289
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
but doing a detailed map
study and identifying the
obstacles that you're going

290
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:27,770
to have to get around.

291
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,520
And there's a couple different methods
that you can use for land navigation.

292
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,990
One of them is called dead reckoning.

293
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,340
And dead reckoning means you get a compass
bearing from point a to point B is,

294
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,100
you know you're going to be
traveling on 270 degrees.

295
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,540
So you put your compost on 270 degrees
and you march, you go in a straight line,

296
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,830
don't let anything take you off that line,
head down and go.

297
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,420
And that's called dead reckoning.

298
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,480
And that's obviously can
be very problematic because
if in between you and where

299
00:19:55,641 --> 00:19:58,850
you're going is a giant mountain or a,
you know, a bunch of rivers or whatever,

300
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:00,800
you're gonna have to go through all
those things and you're going to get,

301
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,990
you're going to get worn out,
you'd get tired.

302
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,130
It might be not tactically
advisable to go through those areas.

303
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:12,250
And so the better form is called
terrain Navar Terrain Association.

304
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,860
And when you're doing that,

305
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:19,310
you actually look at the
map and you study what the,

306
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,980
what the ground is going to do.
And so if there's a big mountain,

307
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,640
you can skirt around the bottom of the
mountain and then you get to have the

308
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,870
side of the mountain and there's a,
a ravine that's,

309
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,380
you can follow that ravine around till
you get to a certain point on the ravine

310
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:32,660
where it cuts far to
the north and you can,

311
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,780
you can head in the other direction to
your, towards your turn. So it's this,

312
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,370
it's a method of really
knowing the terrain that
you're going to be on and it's

313
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,950
infinitely more effective
than dead reckoning.

314
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:47,260
So if you think about this
from a perspective of you
have a mission that trying

315
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:50,320
to get done well, how are you
going to get there? You know,

316
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,970
how are you going to
get this mission done?

317
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,210
Are you going to just put your head down
and absorb any impact that you take and

318
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,050
apply more pressure or
you're going to be smart?

319
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:07,060
Are you going to study the terrain and
take a look and figure out the best way

320
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:12,070
around those obstacles,
those

321
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,310
dead reckoning and terrain association
util the Terrain Association.

322
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,260
You don't like,
let's say,

323
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:22,390
go around the mountain and then tried to
get back on the dead reckoning course.

324
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,410
You're just using the journeys,
the terrain,

325
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,850
and you'll know when
you do your map study,

326
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,240
you'll know that you're going to
go skirt around this mountain.

327
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,560
You're going to go down a ravine,

328
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,680
then you're going to cut
over by this open field.

329
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:37,440
You're going to hold along the wood lines.

330
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,110
When you get to the end of the woodline,
there's going to be a fence.

331
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:43,990
You're going to step over that fence.
Once you get to the offense,

332
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:46,590
you're going to fall the
fence for, you know, uh,

333
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,600
until you hit another big terrain
feature like another hill,

334
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,500
and then you're gonna fall off the base
of that hill until you get to a stream.

335
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,380
So you're going to know exactly
where you're going the whole time.

336
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,540
And you can imagine how
much more effective this is.

337
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,710
I mean you don't have
to look at your compass,

338
00:22:02,711 --> 00:22:06,910
you are taking advantage or you're going
to patrol in areas where you have a

339
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:10,990
tactical advantage too. So it's just uh,
a much, much better way to do things.

340
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,430
So a lot of times I think
people, um, you know,

341
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:17,350
they hear the big uh,

342
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,820
the big navy seal like, oh,
we're just going to get it done.

343
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,870
You just stay on the course,
right?

344
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,620
Well staying on the course means
I'm going to reach my objective.

345
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,360
It doesn't mean I'm going to pound my
head into the wall without thinking.

346
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,350
Right?

347
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,240
So that's what terrain
features do for you.

348
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,600
And there's also some terrain
features that are interesting.

349
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:45,630
You can use reference points that keep
you from going too far so you can know,

350
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:50,680
hey, if we hit this main highway, we went
too far. We know we missed our target,

351
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:53,620
we missed our turn. If we hit this
river, we know we went too far.

352
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:55,720
If we hit this ridge line,
we know we hit went too far.

353
00:22:55,721 --> 00:23:00,070
So you're going to set those up for you
and they're going to confirm where you

354
00:23:00,071 --> 00:23:03,160
are. And also you're going to
use those as reference points,

355
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,820
so you're going to tell you a whole team,
so your whole team is going to know,

356
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,060
hey, we made it this far. Oh there's the
big river that were turning left at. Okay,

357
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:17,290
we turned left and that's awesome. Next
they're going to hit is a Woodbine, oh,

358
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:21,340
here's the woodline so everybody knows.
And so imagine if you're,

359
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,513
again,

360
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,070
think about this outside
the the parameters of land
navigation and patrolling.

361
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:30,610
Think of it in a regular business or any
situation where we're trying to get a

362
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,450
team to do something.

363
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,200
If you lay out the course for them and
you plot out what the obstacles are and

364
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:38,650
you explained to people where they're
going to be and how how important it is

365
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:41,620
that they need to get there and
what we need to be looking out for.

366
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,100
I imagine how the team feels,
the team knows where they,

367
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,160
they understand where they are when you're
doing dead reckoning. The back of the,

368
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:51,830
the guys in the back, they have no idea
where they are. I've been that guy.

369
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,280
I've been that guy in the back of the
patrol and you just have no idea where you

370
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:58,310
are. You have no idea how much further
to go. You just got your head down,

371
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,970
your your slug slugging along with
your weight and it's a nightmare.

372
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,940
Whereas I've been on good
patrols where I'm in the back,

373
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:08,120
but we got a really good brief and I'm
like, oh, there's that mountain own,

374
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:11,210
there's that ravine. Okay, we should
becoming that stream soon. Oh yes,

375
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,130
we're at the stream.
So you know where you are.

376
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:17,180
And when you provide your team with
that kind of clarity on the course that

377
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:18,170
you're planning to take,

378
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,660
it's going to make them so much
more aware of what's happening.

379
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,340
And the more aware they
are of what's happening,

380
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,460
the better performance you're
gonna get from him. Yeah.

381
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,600
The other thing is,
as you're doing this,

382
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:34,610
you do something called a pace
count, which is your, as you walk,

383
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,870
you know how many paces it takes you to
get a hundred yards and there's some, uh,

384
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:41,960
Kentucky windage is there as walks and we
were going uphill or downhill. You can,

385
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,240
you can work out these diff,
what you can get pretty accurate.

386
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,680
So you can know that, hey, when I take
left, when my left foot hits the ground,

387
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,720
on average,
when I'm wearing a hundred pounds,

388
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:55,310
it's 86 paces for me and I just went
a hundred yards. So that's, that's,

389
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:56,210
you'll know that.

390
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,350
And so then what you're doing is you're
constantly checking it gives you another,

391
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:04,820
it gives you another reference point
because if we're supposed to hit, uh,

392
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,020
you know,
a stream in 300 yards,

393
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,460
and I know we've marched 600 yards,
some happened right time for me to stop.

394
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,220
In fact, at 400 yards, I'm
probably gonna stop and say, okay,

395
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,250
let's do a quick map study.
So you want to double check these things.

396
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,330
And in a business world,

397
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:23,720
this could be some kind of a timeline that
you've set up. So you're like, hey, at,

398
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,940
at, you know, 42 days, we should be here
on this project. Oh, we're not there yet.

399
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,600
Okay, what's the problem? What did we
miss? Why aren't we getting it done?

400
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,960
So that gives you two sort
of methodologies to confirm
where you are as you can

401
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:43,430
triangulate your position, which is
smart. What'd you call it? Kentucky. What?

402
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:48,160
Kentucky windage what does it mean it's
give or take? You know, it's just, uh,

403
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,160
it comes from shooting.
Oh, and you would normally,

404
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:54,590
you dial in your site
to get you specifically,

405
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:57,320
let's say you think 600 meters,

406
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,660
but then there's a strong wind blowing.

407
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,840
So maybe you're going to hold off to
the left to the Queen d in Kentucky or

408
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:06,410
something I think is just shooting the,

409
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,410
maybe the shooters in Kentucky had a,

410
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,550
they made it their real accurate
pulling a little Kentucky when we got to

411
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:17,810
accommodate for that. Yeah.
Gotcha. Chicago windage no,

412
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,110
no. Well cause it's kind of
windy, you know, so yeah,

413
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:24,530
I see where you're coming from,
but no, it's, it's, it's Kentucky.

414
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:29,450
Windage my broaching you.
So

415
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,490
like I said, in life plan study,
the route that you're going to go,

416
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:36,680
think about the obstacles.
How are you going to avoid him,

417
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:40,820
what your goals look like? What do your
smaller goals look like along the way?

418
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:44,160
The little reference points. So you've
got somebody you signs with a big project,

419
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:45,360
okay,
what are the little things?

420
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,940
Or you got something in your life
that you're trying to accomplish.

421
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,890
What are the little goals
you've got to set for yourself?

422
00:26:49,891 --> 00:26:52,980
So you get to keep a reference point
along the way and what's the timeline

423
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:56,250
you're going to eat those on?
Yup. That's how you stay on track.

424
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,410
And you know what we actually did?

425
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:02,820
We did something called pacenotes
and what pacenotes were,

426
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,910
and I learned it for for foot patrols and
we ended up using it even more when it

427
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:14,670
came to vehicle patrols. And I,
I realized that, I don't know,

428
00:27:14,671 --> 00:27:15,780
maybe 10 years ago or something,

429
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:19,710
we started sending guys to a rally driving
school so I could learn how to drive

430
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:23,300
rally racing cars.
And that's day.

431
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,060
That's been the way they always done
pacenotes in rally racing. So you,

432
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,640
so what's cool about it
is when you do pacenotes,

433
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:32,460
you're writing down specifically,
this is the terrain feature,

434
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:34,200
this is what I'm seeing.
This is how far away it is.

435
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:35,730
This is the next terrain feature.

436
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:37,350
This is what I'm going to see
and this is how far away it is.

437
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:42,180
So you can actually track that.
Now we got so detailed with that on,

438
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,190
on vehicle mounted patrols,

439
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,270
we would actually just take the map and
blow the map up so we'd see exactly what

440
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:53,271
it looked like at that intersection or
at that juncture at that city blocks.

441
00:27:53,871 --> 00:27:55,980
So we could see what the buildings
look like. So we'd be looking for,

442
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,020
so that's pacenotes and it, and it,
it's almost like a rehearsal, you know,

443
00:28:01,021 --> 00:28:02,340
it's almost like a
rehearsal cause you can,

444
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,240
you can walk the whole team through and
they can get a visualization of what

445
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:09,750
they're going to see and how, how
it's going to look. And the other,

446
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,190
the other piece is that I said is you
got to share that plan and explain it to

447
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:18,240
everybody. So everybody's on the
same sheet. And, and I did this,

448
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,090
w I x explained it to my kids,
you know, and I said, okay,

449
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:23,040
here's what we're going to see.
We're at this area here,

450
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,330
we're going to go across some flack round,

451
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:26,190
we're gonna start hitting some
little terrain features here.

452
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:27,600
It's going to go up and
down and up and down.

453
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:32,190
That's going to tell us that we're here
and not only does it help them know

454
00:28:32,191 --> 00:28:32,641
what's going on,

455
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:36,870
but now I'm talking through it and
that helps me because it helps to teach

456
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:39,570
things because when you teach something,
you become more proficient at it.

457
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,240
That's one of the good things
about teaching anything.

458
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,060
You know you want to get better at
something, teach people how to do it.

459
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,931
It makes you better.

460
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:48,270
You want to teach that arm lock or you
want to get better at the arm lock,

461
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,550
teach the arm lock. You'll notice
all kinds of little details about it.

462
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,430
It's so hard to teach,
like if you're not used to teaching,

463
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:56,880
I jump in there and t cause you're just
used to doing it and a lot of that stuff

464
00:28:56,881 --> 00:29:00,120
you just do without thinking about, okay,
what exactly am I doing? This detail.

465
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:02,310
You just do it.
You don't muscle memory.

466
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:06,780
And there's all these little factors
that facilitate you doing something that

467
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:09,120
you don't even think about and then
tried teaching. You're like, oh,

468
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:11,620
you kind of do this. Wait,
wait, Whoa, whoa. You know,

469
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,140
you didn't even know what you're saying.
You know,

470
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,510
Greg train always throws
out little details like, oh,

471
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:19,140
that's a good little right and
he has something that I do.

472
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,620
But once he points it out or teaches it
and he'll be teaching us something basic

473
00:29:22,621 --> 00:29:26,130
that I know and I'm good
at. And he'll say, oh yeah,

474
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:29,760
and then I put my foot on the hip here
to stabilize this. And I go, I go,

475
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,640
I do that. When you start
thinking about a new focus on it,

476
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,470
it makes you that much better at it.

477
00:29:34,471 --> 00:29:39,120
And it's the same thing that's going to
happen here when you actually brief your

478
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:42,190
team and tell them exactly what to expect.
Now again,

479
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,750
this doesn't mean that
you're going to say, hey,

480
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,070
this is what exactly how it's going to go.

481
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:46,540
Cause you've got to give the caveat that,
hey,

482
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:49,330
this is our plan and where you might
have to deviate from this plan and that's

483
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:53,470
okay, we're ready to do that, where
adaptive. But when you talk through it,

484
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,130
it helps you and it helps
them. Yeah, that's funny.

485
00:29:57,131 --> 00:30:00,700
Greg train is the reason I ran into him.
He was like,

486
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:03,640
he's teaching or whatever and then he
just all of a sudden busts out, hey echo,

487
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,670
teach them that move that you do.
And I was pretty good at that move.

488
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,450
I started teaching.
I think it's like,

489
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,940
it is a guard past that I do
sometimes and Brown, I'm teaching it.

490
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:15,940
I don't even know what I'm talking about.
I'm like doing it all good but,

491
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:19,930
and everyone's like, oh, all
right. You know, I was like
Brown, I am a poor teacher.

492
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,590
Well that's something you can work on.
I guess starting now,

493
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,100
take over the podcast.
I'm more comfortable avoiding it.

494
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,780
Awesome. Uh, now that,

495
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:36,430
now the next piece that I was thinking
about on patrolling and that I saw my

496
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:41,431
kids go through and that I went through
as a young seal is you start questioning

497
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:46,330
or you start going through this process
of what do I need to bring with me?

498
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,130
What do I actually need to bring with
me? Now, when you don't have to carry it,

499
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,720
well, when you don't know what it means
to carry it, carry it. When I say Carrie,

500
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:59,740
I mean put it on your back and
bear the weight of that item.

501
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,830
When you don't have to do that,
you want to carry everything.

502
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:06,300
I'll just carry everything. That warm
sleeping bag in the whisper lights,

503
00:31:06,301 --> 00:31:09,880
stove and the extra food and the
comfort gear and all this stuff.

504
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,330
That's what you do when you,
when you don't have to carry it on,

505
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:16,780
you don't think about carrying on or you
don't know what it feels like to carry

506
00:31:16,781 --> 00:31:19,120
it,
but when you have to carry it,

507
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,110
you get down to what you need real quick
to what you actually need real quick.

508
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,420
Totally limited on the food.
You're not going to be,

509
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:35,730
I never, I never heated a meal in
the field unless it was like, um,

510
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,650
snow on the ground,
a winter warfare scenario,

511
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,550
never heated a meal in the
ground if it was never,

512
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:46,810
never heated a meal because that means
you had to bring a fuel and a whisper

513
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:51,220
light and all this stuff. And
I never, I was a radium side.

514
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,040
I already carry a radio and
then I got used to that.

515
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:57,610
So by the time I was an officer and I
wasn't carrying a radio anymore, I said,

516
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,900
I'm just going to be lighter than
everybody else. Yeah. Um, comfort gear.

517
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,860
No, no, we won't take that. And

518
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,850
do you need to,
do you need to get it,

519
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,980
you need to bring enough comfort here
that you can actually sleep and survive

520
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:16,450
and be, you need to bring a ground
pad or whatever. Um, but you know,

521
00:32:16,451 --> 00:32:20,430
we used to say a little sang was
travel light freeze at night. That,

522
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:23,290
that was my same for sure. Travel
life reasoning. And I'll tell you,

523
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:28,530
I got my indoctrination to freezing
at night and traveling light.

524
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,960
When I first checked into the team,

525
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:37,640
I went to a comm school communication
school, a seal communication school.

526
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,980
So you're going to learn
how to be a radio man in the

527
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,110
seal teams.
And I had this,

528
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:45,680
this old chief that
was run in the running,

529
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:50,681
the running the training and
I was a fired up new guide,

530
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,970
even have my tried it.
So I was just brand new guy,

531
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,610
didn't even try knows at the team
and they sent me to the school.

532
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,480
And so this chief and I actually
went with another new guy who's,

533
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,910
who's a great guy and we went
out there total new guys.

534
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:03,080
Neither one of us had to try it.

535
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:06,410
So we had graduated from buds a couple
months ago or from airborne school,

536
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,430
whatever.
So we showed up,

537
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:12,431
it's wintertime and we show up and the
end of this school you go through uh,

538
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,590
a field training exercise and it's,

539
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,650
I want to say it's five days in the field.

540
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:22,100
It's like Monday through Friday in the
field or something along those lines.

541
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,950
And you are basically doing
the reconnaissance mission
and they give you really

542
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:30,440
good targets to look at and you're going
to look at and you're going to report

543
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,330
back with all this information
and then you're going to move,

544
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,850
they're going to move
you every couple hours.

545
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,550
They give you directions to
a new point to move to. So

546
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,280
we're doing where we're getting ready for
this FTX and I'd never spent much time

547
00:33:43,281 --> 00:33:46,340
in the field and the guy that's
running the course, you know,

548
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:50,690
he's having fun with the new guy and he's
like, hey Welink. And I said, yes chief.

549
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,120
And he goes, you know what you
think your hardcore, and I go,

550
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,540
I'm trying to be hardcore. And he
says, if you're really hardcore,

551
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,400
you don't need a paunch, you don't
need a sleeping bag or a ground pad,

552
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,480
you'd just go out there with a, with a
Poncho and Poncho liner. And I was like,

553
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,650
okay, no problem. So sure enough,

554
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,870
I go in the field with a Poncho and a
Poncho liner and actually I actually,

555
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:18,920
it was a bivy sack, which is a Gortex.
It's like a Goretex sleeping bag.

556
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,820
Just a thin gortex shell
and a Poncho liner,

557
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:25,970
which is something that's been around
forever and it's just a very thin,

558
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,730
thin blanket. No, it's not even
a tent. It's like a blanket.

559
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,970
It's like a blanket. That's what
it is. It's a very thin, it's, yes,

560
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:37,880
it's a very thin liner. It's
what? It's the Poncho liner.

561
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,460
And so I had, those are the two
things I had with me and uh,

562
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,220
and my buddy took the
same so we were like, oh,

563
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,570
oh that you need to be like that to be
hardcore. I'm article or how cold was it?

564
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,290
Like,
so we are going into the field,

565
00:34:54,291 --> 00:34:57,890
we're inserting in the field and in the
sun is going like we've inserted right

566
00:34:57,891 --> 00:34:59,480
at dusk as we're inserting in the field,

567
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:04,481
it's raining right as we get on
the ground at turns to sleet.

568
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,050
And then two hours into the
night it turns into snow.

569
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,800
So we freeze. I mean
we freeze, we're just,

570
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:16,634
we can't sleep.

571
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,290
And the funny thing was
was that we couldn't sleep.

572
00:35:21,291 --> 00:35:23,330
We literally couldn't sleep.
It was too cold for us asleep.

573
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,260
And you and the guy had set it up. So
you had to make a communications window.

574
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:30,290
You had to make communications.
It was about every three or four hours.

575
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,750
And so, and if you missed a
communications window, if you missed it,

576
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,010
that was, you know, you
got your grade went down

577
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,890
or whatever, you got
points subtracted. Hmm.

578
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,160
So all the other guys who were experienced
seals that knew how to live out in

579
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:47,070
the field better than we did,
they all were super comfortable.

580
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,410
They all went out there and had sleeping
bags and ground pads and all that.

581
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,960
And they slept through their calm windows.
At least some of them,

582
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,340
they didn't sleep through all of them,
obviously.

583
00:35:56,341 --> 00:35:59,160
But occasionally it sleeps through one
after four days, three days, whatever.

584
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,440
And so we were the only pair that made
all of our comm windows cause we couldn't

585
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:08,820
say good. You know? Yeah. We'd just
be standing up just standing up,

586
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,660
standing by a tree, doing burpees,
just trying to survive. Yeah.

587
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,780
So that was,
um,

588
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,670
that was one of the lessons
on our learning how to
travel light freeze at night.

589
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,030
Now that we're a little too
much. I I should, you did,

590
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,510
the thing I needed was a ground pad.

591
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:28,320
You need to ground pad when you go in the
field. So travel late, freeze at night.

592
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,630
It's kind of like a warning or is
that like no it's a deal to do.

593
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,540
It was my methodology and it's,
it's the methodology of a PR,

594
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,010
a portion of guys in the military
that are, that are on the,

595
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:44,190
it would rather be on the hard
side. Right. So I'm going to,

596
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,440
I'll freeze that night so I can travel,

597
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,690
travel light freeze at night because
you're going to be more effective when

598
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:53,220
you're, when you're lighter. Yeah. I
mean of course if you're exhausted.

599
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,050
So that's why, that's why
there's gotta be a balance there.

600
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,080
We should have brought ground pads on
that operation to that and that training

601
00:36:58,081 --> 00:36:59,860
operation for sure.
Yeah.

602
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,240
And and like we got trench foot legit
and the guy that was with me had legit

603
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:09,110
trench fort when he got out.
Like no,

604
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,540
it's when your feet cause cause this old
part of this op part of this training

605
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:14,670
operation took place in,
in like a swamp.

606
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,440
So says freezing in the swamp and he got
legit World War One style trench foot.

607
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,660
I had it to my,
not as bad as him but what is that?

608
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,010
It's just your feet get numb
and rotted and jacked up.

609
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,410
Yeah. Good Times. So, so again,

610
00:37:34,411 --> 00:37:39,030
how do we apply this to life
and I, and I think if you,

611
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:44,031
if you look at what you want versus what
you actually need and imagine if you

612
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:49,350
had to carry everything that you owned.
Now of course that's not possible.

613
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:54,380
But I think this is this whole
like minimalist attitude that's,

614
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,910
that's kind of getting popular right
now that it's getting popular in the

615
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:03,300
civilian world right now. But in the
military we've always valued that.

616
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:08,140
And it's one of the cool things
about going away on deployment. They,

617
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:11,070
for me, I always love this feeling
when you went away on deployment,

618
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,270
you can only take w we as as
seals took a lot of gear with us.

619
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:18,900
But there's a limit. You took, you
know, five or six kit bags, you know,

620
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:23,901
five or six big duffel bags basically
filled with gear and that's it.

621
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,550
That's it. That's all your gear.
It's all the gear you have.

622
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,350
And so honestly to me that,
that always felt good.

623
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,900
That is what I got. This is
everything I have. And you know,

624
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:38,560
as a young seal that was basically you
could fit all your gear in those six bags

625
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:40,240
and then everything you
owned in the civilian world,

626
00:38:40,241 --> 00:38:42,610
you could fit in two more
bags. And we live that. Like,

627
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,310
I live like that with my
buddies back in the day.

628
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:48,190
We live like that for a long time. Oh
you, we can go on an appointment tomorrow.

629
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,900
We just put all of our
stuff at home and a kit bag.

630
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,760
We can blow in our stuff up and
we can be ready to go. Yeah.

631
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,850
Kind of like we're the uh,

632
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,010
military guys are Kinda like the
old g minimalists back in the day.

633
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,970
Good. And then we got, I got to
teach Sarah this stuff. Yeah.

634
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,560
When people start to hold on to stuff,

635
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,070
especially the part where
if you or when you carry it,

636
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,670
you realize how much you know that part
where you're talking about once you know

637
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:16,830
the weight of your own stuff,
you think twice before in is really,

638
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,360
really thorough.

639
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,560
Start thinking about the cost of that
gear and what does that mean over time and

640
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:22,120
how much of usage are you
going to get out of it.

641
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,890
Now the thing that I hang on to,

642
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,200
there's a couple things that I'm
a little bit of a hoarder on.

643
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:30,800
One of them is t shirts.
Yeah. I'm not mad at them now.

644
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,830
Now some people might be thinking,
Hey Jocko,

645
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:36,100
you wear the same freaking teacher
every single day. Which is true.

646
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,270
But I have,
you know,

647
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,030
old tee shirts that are
just, I just, I just,

648
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:46,090
cause I wear my tee shirts
a lot when I wear them.

649
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,400
It's hard for me to part with
them better that than shoot.

650
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,400
I have a,

651
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,320
I have a ton of old Jujitsu tee shirts
from like when I used to go to schools,

652
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,500
I used to traveling school.
Yeah.

653
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:59,950
And they'd give me a tee shirt and I
have all these old school teachers of

654
00:39:59,951 --> 00:40:02,860
schools that don't even exist. Aura
schools that got really big or whatever,

655
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,590
or just competitions that I did.
You know,

656
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,580
when you've got those old school t shirts
and I'm not, I don't wear them anymore,

657
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,760
but I was thinking, you know,
what I can do is inventory them,

658
00:40:12,761 --> 00:40:15,790
take pictures of them and put them on
the inner webs and then throw them away.

659
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,630
What do be, oh, like a, like a, like an
archive. Because, because there's some it,

660
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:25,480
it triggers memories that
are like memorabilia really
hard because you like to,

661
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:29,440
uh, it, it triggers the
memory of those times of the,

662
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:32,230
of that event or whatever cause
otherwise you're not thinking about it.

663
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,580
And there was a problem with that.
I'll tell you,

664
00:40:33,581 --> 00:40:38,090
I realize this from my experience,
uh, grown up, you know, I grew up in,

665
00:40:38,091 --> 00:40:41,200
in New England and I don't go home,
didn't go home at all.

666
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,050
It hardly ever go back to
the town where I grew up.

667
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,630
And the people that I
know that are still there,

668
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:50,080
they remember all this stuff
from when we were kids.

669
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:52,540
They remember this event and that,
and remember when this happened.

670
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,740
And I honestly don't remember.
I just don't remember it.

671
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,620
And I think the reason is because I go,

672
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:02,890
went away from there
and it never went back.

673
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:04,750
And so I have nothing triggering
triggering those members.

674
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,020
I don't see the school yard where
the fight happened. I don't see the,

675
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,650
I don't see the, the road where the
car flipped. I don't see that stuff.

676
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,940
And so I don't remember it like they do,
they, they're their old time. Oh yeah.

677
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,970
I remember when little Johnny
you get, you know, it's like, no,

678
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:22,870
I actually don't remember that.
So with some of this memorabilia,

679
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,160
as you called it, sure. If every
time I look at it I go, oh yeah,

680
00:41:27,161 --> 00:41:30,370
that was cool tournament or that was cool
training with those guys or whatever.

681
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:34,370
So I have a bunch of Jujitsu tee shirts
that I have a hard time getting a bar

682
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,703
party with.

683
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,870
I was standing up taking them to the
gym and framing them and hang them up to

684
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:43,150
acoustics. No notch. I was teaching for
a year, but they're old school t shirts.

685
00:41:43,151 --> 00:41:46,580
They'd be cool to have those old kids.
And if you, if you got my t shirts,

686
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,280
Dean tee shirts and Jeff Glover's
tee shirts and put them up in there,

687
00:41:49,281 --> 00:41:53,390
that'd be sick. Yeah. Or it's on the
poster. I remember best of the West.

688
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,220
Remember that tournament? Yeah.
That was a good one. God. Yeah man.

689
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,250
So
that's it.

690
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,730
You go through this checklist back to
the subject here you go through this

691
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,010
checklist of what you actually
need. And again, when you're,

692
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,860
when you're in a business you
got to look at what you, what,

693
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,170
what do you need to complete this
operation, what do you just want?

694
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,000
Cause it'd be nice to have and separate
those things. Separate those things.

695
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,590
You can actually put them in those
categories, you know, need, want,

696
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,630
nice to have. Right. And then
you go through, okay, let's call,

697
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,150
let's contract and what we need first.

698
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,600
And then we can see if there's anything
that we want. And then by the way,

699
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,850
if there's a nice to have, we
can throw in there. Okay fine.

700
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:36,480
But to go in there and just
buy everything on that list or,

701
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,750
or command everything on that list
cause you think you're going to need it.

702
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,200
No wrong answer, wrong roof.
And a lot of times people,

703
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,300
and of course I'm not talking about,

704
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,210
well maybe plays or it does apply
to business, but just in life,

705
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,640
what you need and what you want.
You know,

706
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,260
lot of times what you want doesn't even
facilitate what you need. You know,

707
00:42:55,261 --> 00:42:58,650
how like you'd be like, Oh hey, I,
I, I don't need faster internet,

708
00:42:58,651 --> 00:43:02,100
but I kind of want it. But the faster
Internet is going to facilitate my work.

709
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:06,000
Well it's that you do, you know, you need
the internet at least that something,

710
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:11,001
sometimes people will get stuff that
they want that's just straight up no

711
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:15,750
function. Yeah. Oh yeah, for
sure. Well not in my family.

712
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:20,700
I know
things about function.

713
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:25,620
I know like him don't like him. Um, okay.

714
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,690
So, so again, back to this,

715
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:31,410
once you've decided on what you're going
to bring or what you're going to need,

716
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,010
then it's time to start the operation,
right? It's time to start this movement.

717
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,390
And even from the start you've got
to check, confirm where you are,

718
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,070
make sure you know,
then you get started.

719
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,210
And I had this first reminder when I
did this little patrol with my kids,

720
00:43:45,211 --> 00:43:47,840
cause I just said, oh we're good to go.
It's a little trail and start walking.

721
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:52,350
We started walking. I didn't keep
a pace count. That's ridiculous.

722
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:53,171
That's embarrassing to them.

723
00:43:53,171 --> 00:43:55,920
It didn't keep a pace count and
it wasn't really paying attention.

724
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:59,400
And we're just kind of talking and having,

725
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,050
yeah we're just talking and moving and
kind of getting used to it all. And Hey,

726
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:06,900
how's your backpack for you? And all
that stuff. And all of a sudden I go,

727
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:10,840
wait a second, where are
we? Where are we right now?

728
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,440
Cause I had told them that, hey, we're
gonna be looking for this trail goes up.

729
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,540
And we talked through it and we pulled
out the map and we started doing this

730
00:44:19,541 --> 00:44:23,830
study. And my son was like immediately
with all we went too far, we missed it.

731
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:27,640
I know what it's back there, and my
daughter wouldn't commit either way.

732
00:44:27,641 --> 00:44:30,790
And I said, okay, let's do
an assessment in. So we,

733
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,100
and realize that we actually hadn't gone
quite far enough so we went a little

734
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:39,510
bit further. But my point is
that you got to check yourself.

735
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,710
You got to check yourself and
check your team consistently.

736
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:46,470
Not Constantly, right?
That's micromanagement,

737
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:51,500
but consistently and you also have
to watch out for target fixation,

738
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,530
which is trying to go too fast.
I go,

739
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:59,520
you're just trying to get to that to the
end point without going by your little

740
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:00,600
way points along the way.

741
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,490
That is a way to get yourself lost
because you're driving and you don't,

742
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:10,170
you're not looking for your reference
points and you'll lose the bubble.

743
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,480
So you got to detach a little bit and
stand back and pay attention to not be all

744
00:45:15,481 --> 00:45:20,130
crazy about that. You know for,
you know, every 500 meters,

745
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,170
maybe every you do a quick check.

746
00:45:22,171 --> 00:45:26,460
Every thousand meters you're going to
do a little bit of more accurate study.

747
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:29,760
Okay.

748
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,140
And that's gonna keep you,
keep you in line.

749
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,470
And if you are not aligned, you only
going to be a little bit off track.

750
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:42,471
You're not going to be 12 days of work
or two hours of walking off track.

751
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:44,241
Yeah,

752
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,350
it makes perfect sense to specially we
by all these reference points that target

753
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:50,480
fixation, you're just, you've
got one reference point.

754
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,600
It's probably not even that accurate
because really just by the nature of the

755
00:45:53,601 --> 00:45:54,650
whole deal,
the map,

756
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,190
the one reference point that you do have
is the furthest thing away, literally.

757
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,440
So you only have that one hour for that.

758
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,560
If you have all these other reference
points, you get off track one step,

759
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:07,420
two step, three steps. You still got like
a bond to reference points. He does all,

760
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:10,100
all right, let's backtrack all of
these reference points there to support

761
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,490
Geo. That's, that's how you
do it. And that's again,

762
00:46:12,491 --> 00:46:15,520
that's when you're planning
something with a team and a business.

763
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:18,760
You got to have some reference points
along the way to help you get towards your

764
00:46:18,761 --> 00:46:23,220
goal because your goal is far
off in the distance, you know?

765
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,780
So you've got a plan about
how you're going to get there

766
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,600
if you have a edit video or use
Photoshop or is it has this,

767
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,460
when I first started it has this history
little box.

768
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,520
Every move you make it records. It was,
that's pretty cool. Delete, delete.

769
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,120
And then you have control over it, which
is save. But that's something else.

770
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:47,020
But it, yeah, each one. So you
can literally go back, oh wait,

771
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:51,580
it's reference point with
every single move. That's
awesome. So you can go up, oh,

772
00:46:51,581 --> 00:46:55,900
let me go all the way back. You know, 25
moves to when I erase this little thing.

773
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,440
Oop. And let me start
from there. You know,

774
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,420
you bring one thing back that's
far up the chart. Yeah. The,

775
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,090
here's the only thing it's like, but
it's like a little like a fork kind of.

776
00:47:04,091 --> 00:47:06,400
So like let's say you go back in time,

777
00:47:06,401 --> 00:47:09,940
essentially you go back like five moves
and then you make a different move.

778
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,190
It that one, this course. Yeah, it's
gone. That's why in time traveling. Yep,

779
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,053
exactly.

780
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:20,230
Time. Trial. All right. So
when you get out on patrol now,

781
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,230
um, disciplines paramount.
Sure. For instance,

782
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:28,600
you got to stay hydrated.
You've got to keep track of your gear,

783
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:32,650
you've got to keep of your pace count.
You don't let your gear get out.

784
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:34,490
You don't take out your gear like,
oh were stopped for seconds.

785
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,870
I'm just gonna pull everything out of my
rucksack and lay it all over the place.

786
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:39,790
No,
you got to keep it tight.

787
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,880
You don't rush over obstacles.
So for instance, Oh, you know,

788
00:47:45,881 --> 00:47:47,170
it was a little log and I got us,

789
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,290
there's a log going across this
trail and I got to step over the log.

790
00:47:50,830 --> 00:47:53,650
Well I step up on top of it and then
I'm just going to jump off cause I,

791
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:55,420
it's a little easier.
No,

792
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:57,610
you don't just jump off cause
that's how you sprain your ankle.

793
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,100
That's how you blow out a
knee, which is, you know what,

794
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,640
you're playing a basketball
game or you're on the Jujitsu,

795
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:06,850
Matt and you and you twist your
ankle. Cool. We'll walk to the side,

796
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,590
but some ice on it, you're, you know,

797
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:17,130
10 kilometers out in the middle of
nowhere and one of your kids sprains and

798
00:48:17,711 --> 00:48:21,190
ankle urine, you're in trouble.
You have a, you're in trouble.

799
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:26,470
And if you're out on patrol in a military
situation and you get somebody that

800
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:29,050
gets sprained ankle,
you're an even more significant trouble.

801
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,310
So you got to have the
discipline to slow down.

802
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,660
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Watch your footing, watch for danger.

803
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,980
Watch your field of fire.

804
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,930
Pay attention to the first person that's
in front of you and the person that's

805
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,830
behind you. And that's how
you're doing new communications.

806
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:50,200
You got to keep your communication
up the whole time. So again,

807
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,920
you can go right to any business,
any project that everyone's working on.

808
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,200
It's all the same thing.
You got to be disciplined,

809
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,600
you got to keep track of things.

810
00:48:58,601 --> 00:49:02,290
You gotta keep your communication going
between your team members by passing

811
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:03,550
whatever signals you've got to pass.

812
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:10,330
When you get to a layup point where when
you're going to actually stop and and

813
00:49:10,331 --> 00:49:13,670
basically camp out. I hate saying
that because in the, in the,

814
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:17,980
in the seal teams it's derogatory to say,
oh yeah,

815
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:20,740
so you never want to have anybody
say that. So I wouldn't let my,

816
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:24,030
when I went on patrol with my kids I was
like, no, we're not camping limp point.

817
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:27,130
But so you guys are camping out.
No or not.

818
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,900
So w w when you get to a lay up
point where you're going to stop,

819
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,430
you don't just flop down and
turn into a pile of crap.

820
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:40,820
And this is true. Again,
with a business situation,

821
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:44,500
you reach one goal.
You don't just like flop down and say,

822
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:49,150
oh we did it high five a office party.
No you can,

823
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:53,140
you can order a pizza maybe,
but you're not ordering booze.

824
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,170
You know what I'm saying? You still
got stuff to do so you don't camp out.

825
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:58,690
You have to remain tackle.
You have to remain disciplined.

826
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:02,920
You have to quietly assume
your security position,

827
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,790
you got to then be quiet and make sure
you are as a loan as you think you are.

828
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:10,240
Then you got to pick out some landmarks.
Once you get to your little lamp point,

829
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:12,850
you gotta, you gotta make
that your home. You know,

830
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:14,770
you got to look at for
some landmarks or some

831
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:20,620
somewhere where you know where you are
and then you confirm your position.

832
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,570
You know, you take a
triangulation with your compass,

833
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:28,130
maybe even break out your gps, get a
little double confirmation. And then once

834
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:30,360
you've got everything set, then you
can take a little breather. Hmm.

835
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:34,180
But what you don't do is get to the
finish line and just flop down and uh,

836
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:38,810
we made it right. You never want
to do that. And the other piece,

837
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,810
this is something I've thought about a
lot while I was on this patrol with my,

838
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,180
with my two kids,
I went with two out of the four kids.

839
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:46,660
Okay.

840
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:51,450
When that, we kind of have a standard in
most militaries do this. You're going to,

841
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:55,030
when you're, when you're doing a patrol,
you're going to move for 50 minutes.

842
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:57,460
Mean you're going to walk for 15 minutes
and you're gonna rest for 10 then your

843
00:50:57,461 --> 00:51:00,760
walk for 15 rest for 10 walk from
50 and that's kind of the standard.

844
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:05,620
And I can tell you that
if you aren't careful,

845
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:11,520
it can be hard to start up again and
you get tired legs and you get sore

846
00:51:12,221 --> 00:51:17,221
shoulders and you get hunger and you get
thirsty and it's easy to let 10 minutes

847
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:22,660
turned into 15 minutes and turn it into
20 minutes and turn it into a half an

848
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,480
hour. That can happen very, very easily.

849
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,070
And this is the thing you got to remember
while you are arresting,

850
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,390
you are getting no closer to your target.

851
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,460
There is no progress that is being made.

852
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,690
And by the way,

853
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:47,440
the only person that is going to
move you toward that target is you.

854
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:51,213
Yeah.

855
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:54,090
You're the only person that's
gonna move you towards that target.

856
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:57,210
You're not going to get carried.
Their target's not going to move to you.

857
00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:00,180
You are the only person that's
going to move to the target.

858
00:52:00,181 --> 00:52:04,290
And if you don't move, you'll never get
there. And the faster you get there,

859
00:52:04,291 --> 00:52:06,510
the better off you're going to be.
Now again,

860
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:10,620
this doesn't mean that you're simply
grinding yourself and your team into the

861
00:52:10,621 --> 00:52:12,960
dirt.
There are rest periods involve there.

862
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:15,330
You have 10 minutes of rest of
you have 50 minutes of work.

863
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,270
So I'm not talking about
smashing your team, right?

864
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,620
But you absolutely do have to drive your
team because there will be no progress

865
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,800
in the comfort zone. There will
not in the inside the comfort zone,

866
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:35,070
there's no progress happening.
There's nothing happening.

867
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:40,740
And when you're patrolling
with a rucksack on,

868
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:44,580
it is not comfortable, is not
comfortable, it's not easy.

869
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,380
And that is one of the things.

870
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:51,381
That's why this discipline of keeping
moving and continuing to push the pace is

871
00:52:52,111 --> 00:52:53,430
so powerful.

872
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:58,860
And that's the same thing with any goal.
Obviously,

873
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,070
the correlation here is that
any goal that you're going for,

874
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:06,960
you have to keep moving toward it.
You have to stay on the path.

875
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:09,063
Yeah.

876
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:13,930
Do you have to rest? Yes, but you have
to go, you have to go down that path

877
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:20,550
and that is another one of these
principles and all of these principles day

878
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:25,980
really apply to everything
that I did in my seal career,

879
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:30,300
regardless of what I was doing.
The same things, planning, well,

880
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,830
setting goals, knowing what they look
like, staying disciplined on everything,

881
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,870
on every type of mission, on every task,
every job. That is what I always did.

882
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:46,730
I didn't take it easy. Did I
rest? Sure, of course I arrested,

883
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,300
but did I cut corners?
Did I take the easy way?

884
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:54,300
Did I slack off?

885
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,413
No,

886
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,840
no, I did not. I held the line.

887
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,900
Now from a leadership perspective,

888
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:13,750
all this talk of marching and patrolling
made me think of a short story

889
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:20,300
called the beloved captain,

890
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:26,530
which I was recently introduced to by the
wife of one of the finest leaders I've

891
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:31,640
ever worked for.
A guy named General Sean McFarland,

892
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:36,440
who was the colonel at the time
who was commanding the one one a d,

893
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,750
the first brigade of the
First Armored Division,

894
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:42,140
otherwise known as the ready
first during the battle of Ramadi.

895
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:48,370
And I recently saw general mcfarlane's
a wife at a memorial event that we did

896
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,620
for the 10 year anniversary
of Mark Lee's death.

897
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,920
And she told me about this story.
Again,

898
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:05,921
it's called the beloved captain and it
lays out some fundamental leadership

899
00:55:06,561 --> 00:55:07,394
principles.

900
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,580
And when the general's wife told me
that he kind of referred to this story

901
00:55:13,191 --> 00:55:15,350
himself for guidance,

902
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:20,090
I figured maybe the kind
of guidance we can all use.

903
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:26,560
And the story is written by a guy named
Donald Hanky who served with the British

904
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,630
army in World War One,

905
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:35,730
the volunteer who enlisted
at age 29 despite having
served as an officer when he

906
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:41,400
was younger,
he enlisted

907
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:46,570
to go fight and eventually
regained his commission.

908
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,270
And in both as a enlisted guy,
as an and as an officer,

909
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,730
he fought on the front lines

910
00:55:58,190 --> 00:56:02,720
and he wrote this story,
which is called,

911
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:05,690
as I said,
the beloved captain.

912
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:15,350
He came in the early days when we
were still at recruit drills under hot

913
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:19,440
September, son Tall, erect, smiling.

914
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:24,550
So we first saw him and so he to the end,

915
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:29,770
at the start he knew his
little of soldiering is we did.

916
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,380
He used to watch us being
drilled by the sergeant,

917
00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:37,630
but his manner of watching was peculiar
to his own. He never looked bored.

918
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,840
He was learning just as much as we were.
In fact more,

919
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:46,260
he was learning his job and from the
first he saw that his job was more than to

920
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:49,300
give us the correct orders.

921
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,530
His job was to lead us,

922
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,110
so he watched and noted many
things and never found the time.

923
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:02,340
Hang on, heavy, heavy on his hands.

924
00:57:03,270 --> 00:57:07,560
He watched our evolutions so as to
learn to learn the correct orders.

925
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,870
He watched for the
right manner of command,

926
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:12,990
the manner which secured the
most prompt response to an order,

927
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,620
and he watched every one of us for
our individual characteristics.

928
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,350
We were his men already.

929
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:24,450
He took an almost paternal interest in us.
He noted the men who tried hard,

930
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,910
but we're naturally slow and awkward.

931
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,650
He distinguished them from those
who were inattentive and board.

932
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:36,480
He marked down the keen and most
efficient among us. Most of all,

933
00:57:36,481 --> 00:57:41,430
he studied those who were subject to moods
who are sulky one day and willing the

934
00:57:41,431 --> 00:57:46,380
next. These were the ones
who were to turn the scale.

935
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,760
If he could get these on his side,
the battle would be one.

936
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,430
So here's this leader,

937
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:00,380
very important for him to learn about as
men and know his men and study his men.

938
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,420
We've heard this before,

939
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:09,410
back to the book for the first few days,
he just watched.

940
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:10,940
Then he started work.

941
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:14,780
He picked out some of the most awkward
ones and accompanied by a corporal,

942
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:18,200
marched them away by
themselves in generously.

943
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,560
He explained that he did
not know much himself yet,

944
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:26,090
but he thought that they might be on
my get on better if they drilled by

945
00:58:26,091 --> 00:58:28,430
themselves a bit and
that if it helped the,

946
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:32,210
if he helped them and they helped him,
they would soon learn.

947
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:34,640
So there's some serious humility
going on there. He's like, Hey,

948
00:58:34,641 --> 00:58:38,180
I don't know that much. You guys don't
know that much. Let's help each other.

949
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:42,440
Let's build a little team here.
His confidence was infectious.

950
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,120
He looked at them and they looked at him
and the men pulled themselves together

951
00:58:47,121 --> 00:58:49,670
and determined to do their best,

952
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:53,520
so he formed relationships here.

953
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,100
Their best surprised themselves.

954
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,230
His patients was inexhaustible.

955
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:05,160
His simplicity could not
fail to be understood.

956
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:11,430
He's keeping things simple, so simple
that they could not fail to be understood.

957
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:14,910
His keenness and optimism
carried all with them.

958
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:19,500
Very soon the awkward squad
found themselves awkward,

959
00:59:19,501 --> 00:59:24,080
no longer and after that they cease to
be a squad and went back to the platoon.

960
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:28,700
Then he started to drill the platoon with
sergeant standing by to point out his

961
00:59:28,701 --> 00:59:29,534
mistakes.

962
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:34,630
Of course he made mistakes and when that
happened he never minded admitting it.

963
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:38,880
Some extreme ownership going on.

964
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,750
He would explain what mistakes
he had made and try again.

965
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:48,380
The result was that we began to take
almost as much interest and pride in his

966
00:59:48,931 --> 00:59:51,240
progress as he did in ours.

967
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:54,750
We were his men and he was our leader.

968
00:59:55,530 --> 01:00:00,180
We felt that he was a credit to us
and we resolve to be a credit to him.

969
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:05,130
There was a bond of mutual
confidence and affection between us,

970
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,040
which grew stronger and stronger.
As the months passed,

971
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,940
he had a smile for almost everyone,

972
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:15,390
but we thought he had a
different smile for us.

973
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:21,000
We looked for it and were never
disappointed on parade as long as we were

974
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:24,030
trying.
His smile encouraged us off parade.

975
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:26,130
If we passed him and saluted his eyes,

976
01:00:26,131 --> 01:00:29,580
look straight into our own
and his smile greeted us.

977
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,330
It was a wonderful thing.
That smile of his,

978
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,480
it was something worth living for when
worth working for a bucked one up when

979
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,950
one was bored or tired,

980
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:44,640
it seemed to make one look at things
from a different point of view,

981
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,790
a finer point of view,
his point of view.

982
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,840
There was nothing feeble or weak about it.

983
01:00:52,530 --> 01:00:56,820
It was not monotonous like
the smile of Sunny Jim.

984
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,740
It meant something.

985
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:04,580
It meant that we were his men and that
he was proud of us and sure that we were

986
01:01:05,611 --> 01:01:09,600
going to do jolly well better
than any of the other platoons.

987
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,930
And it made us determine that we would

988
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:15,173
okay

989
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,210
when we failed him,
when he was disappointed in us,

990
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,640
he did not smile.
He did not rage or curse.

991
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,370
He just looked disappointed.

992
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:32,670
And that made us feel far more savage
with ourselves in any amount of swearing

993
01:01:32,951 --> 01:01:33,784
would have done

994
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:41,030
point we've talked about on here many
times that guy that's yelling and

995
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:45,220
screaming, not getting respect, that

996
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:49,470
that has a lot to do. Also actually
probably everything to do also with,

997
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:53,380
remember who we were talking about. Um,
use the carrot and the stick, you know,

998
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,680
so that's basically, I mean, you know,

999
01:01:55,681 --> 01:02:00,681
on top of the bond or it could be a sense
kind of the same thing where when they

1000
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:03,420
look for that approval, which we
all do with our friends especially,

1001
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:09,390
they're not looking to avoid him getting
mad. They're looking to make them happy.

1002
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,230
See, because of that, you know how, how
that feels or how, how good that is.

1003
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,350
So he doesn't have to get mad.
He just has to basically go to zero.

1004
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:19,920
He doesn't have to go negative 10 on him.
Yeah. He goes to zero one there like,

1005
01:02:19,921 --> 01:02:20,754
Dang,

1006
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:22,870
I bill, I'm gonna get back to
that. Yeah, that Tan. Yeah.

1007
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,810
And it's just great language.

1008
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,140
He just looked disappointed and that made
us feel far more savage with ourselves

1009
01:02:31,171 --> 01:02:33,180
in any amount of squaring would've done.
Yep.

1010
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:39,210
And I had a boss like that one time
with our whole golden life was just to,

1011
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:43,500
just to make,
make him look good and have them say,

1012
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,190
give us a smile on their job.
And we were all fired up,

1013
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,860
know back to the book.

1014
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:53,130
He made us feel that we were
not playing the game with him.

1015
01:02:53,131 --> 01:02:54,120
This is if they messed up.

1016
01:02:54,121 --> 01:02:56,820
He made us feel that we were
not playing the game by him.

1017
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:00,990
It was not what he said.
He was never very good at talking.

1018
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:06,770
It was just how he looked and his look
of displeasure and disappointment was a

1019
01:03:07,441 --> 01:03:09,600
thing that we would do anything to avoid.

1020
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:15,470
The fact was that he had won
his way into our affections.

1021
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:21,020
We loved him and there isn't anything
stronger than love when all said and done.

1022
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:30,220
He was humble too, if that is
the right word and I think it is.

1023
01:03:30,370 --> 01:03:33,970
No trouble of ours was too
small for him to attend to.

1024
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:38,620
When we started route
marches for instance,

1025
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:43,030
and our feet were blistered and
sore as they often were. At first,

1026
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:47,380
you would have fought that. They were
his own feet from the trouble he took.

1027
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,233
Of course,

1028
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,050
after the march there was always an
inspection of feet that is routine,

1029
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,870
but with him it was no mere routine.

1030
01:03:56,650 --> 01:04:00,160
He came into our rooms and if
anyone had a sore fit foot,

1031
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:05,260
he would kneel down on the floor and look
at it as carefully as if he had been a

1032
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:06,094
doctor.

1033
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:11,020
Then he would prescribe and the remedies
were ready at hand being borne by the

1034
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:13,900
sergeant.
If a blister had to be lanced,

1035
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:18,070
you would very likely lance it himself
then in there so as to make sure there

1036
01:04:18,071 --> 01:04:21,790
was done with a clean needle and
that no dirt was allowed to get in.

1037
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:30,020
There was no effication about this,
no striving after effect.

1038
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:35,560
There was simply that he felt that our
feet were pretty important and that he

1039
01:04:35,961 --> 01:04:38,270
knew that we were pretty careless.

1040
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:43,600
So he thought it best at the start
to see to the master himself.

1041
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,570
Nevertheless,
there was an our rise,

1042
01:04:47,571 --> 01:04:50,750
something almost religious
about this care for our feet.

1043
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:56,710
It seemed to have a touch of the Christ
about it and we loved and honored him

1044
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:57,883
the more

1045
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:04,860
literally getting down on his hands and
knees and caring for the feet of his men.

1046
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,950
Okay. And you know, you can
imagine the leaders that would,

1047
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,650
that would see this as being beneath them

1048
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,270
and maybe even thinking in some way
that this would make them look bad.

1049
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:24,100
Right. But you can see, obviously
he's comparing him to Jesus.

1050
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,100
Hmm.

1051
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:27,300
So I think it was a,

1052
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,280
I think it had a good effect on the men.

1053
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,733
Thanks.

1054
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,810
We knew that we should lose him.

1055
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:42,670
For one thing,
we knew that he would be promoted.

1056
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:48,510
There was our great hope that some
day he would command the company also.

1057
01:05:49,151 --> 01:05:51,490
We knew that he would be killed.

1058
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:58,080
He was so amazingly
unselfconscious for that reason.

1059
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:01,360
We knew that he would
be absolutely fearless.

1060
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:07,650
He would be so keen on the job in hand
and so anxious for as men that he would

1061
01:06:07,691 --> 01:06:09,610
forget about his own danger.

1062
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:15,370
So it proved he was a captain.
When we went out to the front,

1063
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:19,870
whenever there was a tiresome job
to be done, he was there in charge.

1064
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:24,430
If ever there were a moment of danger,
he was on the spot.

1065
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,470
If there were any particular part of
the line where the shells were falling

1066
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:34,120
faster or the bombs dropping more thickly
than in other parts, he was in it.

1067
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,640
It was not that he was conceited
and imagined himself indispensable.

1068
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:45,570
It was just that he was so keen that the
men should do their best and act wordly

1069
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:46,780
of the regiment.

1070
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:53,040
He knew that fellows hated turning out
at night for fatigue when they were in

1071
01:06:53,591 --> 01:06:54,424
arrest camp.

1072
01:06:55,090 --> 01:06:59,290
He knew how tiresome the Long March there
and back and digging in the dark for

1073
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:00,760
an unknown purpose war.

1074
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:04,000
He knew that the fellows would
be inclined to grouse and Sherk.

1075
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:08,350
So he thought that it was up to him to
go and show them that he thought it was a

1076
01:07:08,351 --> 01:07:09,580
job worth doing.

1077
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,710
And the fact that he was there put a new
complexion on the matter all together,

1078
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:19,240
no one would shirk if he was there.
No one would grumble so much either.

1079
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:23,860
What was good enough for
him was good enough for us.

1080
01:07:28,930 --> 01:07:31,950
So you got to got to get
out there and you know,

1081
01:07:31,951 --> 01:07:35,950
I've told stories about picking
up brass and doing the taking.

1082
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:37,750
The bad watch is all those things.

1083
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,080
And this is a exact commentary about that.

1084
01:07:44,110 --> 01:07:47,020
Just because you're in a leadership
position doesn't mean you don't get to do

1085
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,750
the hard stuff.
We don't have to do the art stuff.

1086
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:50,740
It actually means you do the hard stuff.

1087
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:57,130
But let's talking to jade
who days ago and you know,

1088
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:00,350
he's the boss of his company and stuff.
Um,

1089
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:04,050
and man, it pretty much every word
that's coming from that is like, man,

1090
01:08:04,051 --> 01:08:05,250
it's reminded me of this,
where

1091
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,940
like this certain people in a group
that can do that, that can go and like,

1092
01:08:10,941 --> 01:08:12,680
you know, he'll, there'll wash
your sheets, then you don't leave.

1093
01:08:12,740 --> 01:08:16,250
You don't automatically have that respect.
In some cases

1094
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,610
you'll have less respect if like,
sure.

1095
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,210
Like they're kissing your butt and
they don't have anything to look up to,

1096
01:08:23,211 --> 01:08:28,010
you know, or, or you know,
these, these kinds of guys or
whatever. But the point is,

1097
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:31,730
as the leader or the boss
or the dad or whatever,

1098
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:36,050
like everyone in the group is, is
watching you. People are watching.

1099
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:40,100
So if you're like, you can be
like, Hey, you can make 10, 20,

1100
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:42,680
50 great moves and then,

1101
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:46,250
but let's say he just kind of come in
late every day or something like that.

1102
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,310
Or like you're anticipating or something.
Yeah, they're watching. So they're like,

1103
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,130
okay, I see that. And they're
not being critical necessarily.

1104
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:55,260
They're just watching, I'm sure. Yeah.

1105
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:58,160
I mean he can go conscious or even
subconscious. It could be, yeah,

1106
01:08:58,161 --> 01:09:02,150
they could be getting critical. But man,
they're watching. So when you're like,

1107
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:07,070
when if they see you slack off, they're
like, it's okay to slack off. Yeah.

1108
01:09:07,071 --> 01:09:09,780
All right. Okay, okay. That's what we're
doing. You're not eating, you know,

1109
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:13,100
if you're from a leadership position,
you're slacking,

1110
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,290
you're followers are going to slack.
There's no doubt about it.

1111
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,490
And let there be no doubt.
Or You lose your temper.

1112
01:09:18,491 --> 01:09:21,620
Or even even if like you think no one's
paying attention, and he was like,

1113
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,340
you know, your kid is cruising with
your whatever you're on the phone with,

1114
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:28,390
I don't know, the cable guy and you
know how they schedule that, you know,

1115
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,410
between these two and
you're mad or whatever.

1116
01:09:30,411 --> 01:09:35,160
I'd be there between 9:00 AM and 9:00
PM or 9:00 AM the next day or something

1117
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:39,280
and you lose your temper on the cable guy
probably he's watching. I was like, oh,

1118
01:09:39,281 --> 01:09:42,740
okay. That's kind of how it
is. Like that's how we do
it kind of thing. You know?

1119
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,210
I'm happy for watching. So yeah, this
guy where he's doing the hard stuff,

1120
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:50,720
you know, the, the top level stuff,
bottom line, he's doing it all.

1121
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:53,390
People were watching it and they
see it, so they're like, man,

1122
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:54,380
that's the way to roll.

1123
01:09:55,470 --> 01:09:58,880
That they didn't think were digging in
and move moving at night and digging in,

1124
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:04,050
you know, for an unknown purpose. They,
he knew that they weren't fired up with.

1125
01:10:04,051 --> 01:10:06,350
Soon as he showed up and started
doing it, they all realize, okay,

1126
01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:08,690
it's good enough for him. You
know, that's how we're rolling.

1127
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:11,660
It's good enough for us and
they're back to the book.

1128
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:14,630
What was good enough for
him was good enough for us.

1129
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,560
If it were not too much
trouble for him to turn out,

1130
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:20,870
it was not too much trouble for us.

1131
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:24,650
He knew to how trying the nerves,

1132
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,970
how trying to the nerves it is to
sit in a trench and be shelled.

1133
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:33,740
He knew what a temptation there is to
move a bit farther down the trench and

1134
01:10:33,741 --> 01:10:37,670
heard together and a bunch
at what seems the safest end.

1135
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:43,540
He knew to the folly of doing it and that
there that it was not the thing to do,

1136
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:46,400
not done in the best regiments.

1137
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:52,040
So he went along to see that it did not
happen to see that the demand stuck to

1138
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:56,270
their posts and conquered their nerves.
And as soon as we saw him,

1139
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:01,280
we forgot our own anxiety. It
was move a bit further down, sir,

1140
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:05,390
we are all right here,
but don't you go exposing yourself?

1141
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,850
We didn't matter.
We knew it then.

1142
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:11,240
We were just rank and
file bound to take risks.

1143
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:14,160
The company would get
along all without us, but

1144
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,993
the captain,

1145
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,600
how was the company to get on without
him to see him was to catch his point of

1146
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:21,900
view,

1147
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:26,900
to forget our personal anxieties and
think only of the company and the regiment

1148
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:28,193
and honor.

1149
01:11:31,050 --> 01:11:34,140
That's an interesting
concept is that you're,

1150
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:39,200
this leader's presence actually opened
his troopers minds to what he saw.

1151
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:42,683
Yup.

1152
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:44,790
Okay.

1153
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:45,930
That's awesome.

1154
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:52,860
There was not one of us but
would gladly have died for him.

1155
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:58,260
We longed for the chance to
show him that we weren't heroes.

1156
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:01,500
We never dreamed about
getting the Victoria Cross.

1157
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,600
But to save the captain,

1158
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:08,720
we would have earned it 10 times over
and never have cared a button whether we

1159
01:12:09,031 --> 01:12:09,900
got it or not.

1160
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:16,400
We never got the chance.
Worst luck.

1161
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:20,990
It was all the other way.
We were holding some trenches,

1162
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:24,050
which are about as
unhealthiest trenches could be

1163
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:29,330
the bushes,
which is a slang term for the Germans.

1164
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:35,260
The Bush's were only a few yards away
and we're well supplied with trench

1165
01:12:35,781 --> 01:12:38,090
mortars.
We hadn't got any at the time.

1166
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,510
Bombs and air torpedoes were
dropping around us all day.

1167
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:46,460
Of course the captain was there.
It seemed as if he could not keep away.

1168
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:51,920
A torpedo fell into the trench
and buried some of our trap chops.

1169
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:55,940
The fellows next to them
ran to dig them out.

1170
01:12:56,630 --> 01:12:59,210
Of course he was the first one,

1171
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,490
then came another torpedo
in the same place.

1172
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:10,910
That was the end,
but he lives

1173
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:14,570
somehow he lives

1174
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,230
and we who knew him do not forget.

1175
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,860
We feel his eyes on us.

1176
01:13:23,010 --> 01:13:26,250
We still work for that
wonderful smile of his.

1177
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,060
There are not many of
the old lot left now,

1178
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:35,210
but I think those who went west have
seen him when they got to the other side.

1179
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:41,670
I think they were met.
Someone said,

1180
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:43,920
well done,
good and faithful servant.

1181
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,290
And as they knelt before
that gracious pierced figure,

1182
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:53,310
I reckon they saw nearby
the captain's smile.

1183
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:58,490
Anyway,
in that faith,

1184
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,850
let me die if death should come my way.

1185
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,390
And so I think

1186
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,740
shall I died content

1187
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,943
and

1188
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:19,560
die.
He did.

1189
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:27,020
Donald Hanky who wrote that story was
badly wounded in the battle of Ypres on

1190
01:14:30,391 --> 01:14:35,190
July 30th, 1915 and after
recovering from those wounds,

1191
01:14:35,191 --> 01:14:36,630
he went back to the front,

1192
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:40,460
including action at
the battle of the Somme

1193
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:48,010
and later preparing to go over
the top at one 30 in the afternoon

1194
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:54,110
on October 12th,

1195
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:59,110
1916 lieutenant a Hanky was reported to
have told his men if wounded blighty,

1196
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,090
if killed resurrection

1197
01:15:06,030 --> 01:15:10,630
in Blighty was a term that basically
meant million dollar wound,

1198
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:15,520
which we've talked about before on this
podcast. The million dollar wound is,

1199
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:18,070
hey, you get shot, it
gets you off the front,

1200
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,250
but it doesn't kill you and
it doesn't maim you for life.

1201
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,620
It's $1 million wouldn't. And that
day the Brits called that a blight.

1202
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:29,680
And so at one 30 in the afternoon on
October 12th as his guys are getting ready

1203
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:30,580
to go over the top,

1204
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:35,581
he tells his men if wounded
blighty if killed resurrection.

1205
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:38,900
So you boys have nothing to fear.

1206
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,990
Shortly thereafter he was killed.

1207
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:51,000
He is said to have been buried
near the spot where he fell,

1208
01:15:51,001 --> 01:15:53,490
although the grave was never found.

1209
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,090
But we do have his words.

1210
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:07,260
So let us heed those words as we tried
to lead others as well as he did as well

1211
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:13,580
as we can,

1212
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:18,150
as well as the beloved captain.

1213
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,273
And with that,

1214
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:37,570
it's been some time since we've done
some questions for the Internet so we can

1215
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:43,090
move to those questions.
So sounds was good

1216
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:45,993
after,

1217
01:16:49,470 --> 01:16:52,860
after hearing a story like that,
it's,

1218
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:59,670
it's always tough for me to remember
that when you hear a one story like that,

1219
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:06,190
you've got to remember that there are
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1220
01:17:06,191 --> 01:17:08,140
stories like that

1221
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:14,060
war and of leadership,

1222
01:17:16,210 --> 01:17:17,590
end of sacrifice.

1223
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:25,900
And if we don't do our damnedest
to learn from those lessons,

1224
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:28,450
yeah.

1225
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:29,740
And apply them,

1226
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:36,120
I questioned whether we even
deserve to have this life.

1227
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:44,680
Yeah. That though about this,
this story, beloved captain.

1228
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:45,673
Yes.

1229
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:51,460
Like that's such a clear demonstration
on how to be, where these guys would,

1230
01:17:51,461 --> 01:17:53,620
would follow this guy basically into fire.

1231
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:56,320
They could probably watch them walk
into a pit of fire and they'd all fall.

1232
01:17:57,340 --> 01:18:02,130
They did. Yeah. Think about it. They
did. That's what World War One was. Yeah.

1233
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,830
Stand up. Go follow me. We're going.

1234
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,340
Yeah.

1235
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:11,340
So if this guy's mere presence can make
these other guys follow him like that in

1236
01:18:14,261 --> 01:18:18,280
these types of situations, like if more
people would be like this guy, you know,

1237
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:24,070
in normal life, I mean it'd be a
breeze to have people you know,

1238
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:26,790
listened to you and you
guys get some stuff done.

1239
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:27,091
And,

1240
01:18:27,091 --> 01:18:32,091
and how much of the stuff that the beloved
captain does is counterintuitive of

1241
01:18:35,131 --> 01:18:39,000
what people think of a military guy.
I mean, almost everything in there,

1242
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,150
he's admitting his mistakes.

1243
01:18:42,330 --> 01:18:46,890
He's figuring out who's
awkward at admitting to them
that he's kind of messed up

1244
01:18:46,891 --> 01:18:49,650
too.
He's getting down on his knees and,

1245
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:54,090
and basically being almost submissive
to his men in order to make sure that

1246
01:18:54,091 --> 01:18:57,330
they're healthy.
He's taking all the hard jobs.

1247
01:18:57,390 --> 01:19:02,390
He's smiling and developing these
strong relationships with his men.

1248
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:07,760
Like every one of those things is
almost counter to what people think. Uh,

1249
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:08,693
um,

1250
01:19:09,390 --> 01:19:14,220
a big tough military is the jewel
Sargent drill Sargent leader like no.

1251
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:15,140
And,

1252
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:19,740
and so I see people in the civilian
sector that ended up in the same way they

1253
01:19:19,741 --> 01:19:23,730
think, they think that that's how you
lead because they've seen it in a movie,

1254
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:25,320
you know,
that is not that,

1255
01:19:25,321 --> 01:19:29,520
that that hyper aggressive mentality is,

1256
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:32,190
is ineffective with human beings.

1257
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,550
And actually there's a question here,

1258
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:38,370
so we'll probably talk about
that some more. Um, but,

1259
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,770
but that's why I always make it
perfectly clear that I'm all about being

1260
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:42,240
aggressive.
Yeah.

1261
01:19:42,810 --> 01:19:45,240
I'm all about being aggressive but
being aggressive towards your mission,

1262
01:19:45,241 --> 01:19:48,840
not towards people. I mean, unless
the person warrants aggressiveness,

1263
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:52,870
which does happen from time to time,
that's called a fist fight.

1264
01:19:55,400 --> 01:20:00,050
You ended up part,
he noted where his mere presence kind of,

1265
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:04,500
um, not imposed, but impacts impacts
their perspective where it's like,

1266
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:08,040
it's basically him walking in to,
to whatever

1267
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:11,730
the situation and them just
kind of automatically a
what what's he seeing right

1268
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:14,220
there? So just coming
to them, hey, let me,

1269
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:16,440
let me move this weapon cause
it's in a bad spot. Let me,

1270
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,650
let me pull it up like that stuff up here.
That is completely right.

1271
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:24,520
Completely right. I was on a ship one
time and I thought it was about the,

1272
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:28,260
the commanding officer on a ship.
There's something called the one Mc,

1273
01:20:28,261 --> 01:20:31,680
which is a basically a loudspeaker that
goes throughout every portion of the

1274
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:32,514
ship.
Everyone can hear it.

1275
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:36,960
And this commanding officer gets on the
Sh gets on the one MC and he's going to

1276
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:39,390
make a speech, right? Because that's
what commanding officers do sometimes.

1277
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,240
And he says,

1278
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:46,230
I thought he was going to make the most
epic speech because he's not the most

1279
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:49,290
epic, but I thought he's
going to say something pretty
powerful. Sure. He says, um,

1280
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:53,010
he says, Hey, when you, when, when,

1281
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:57,930
when you see a piece of trash on the
ship and when I see a piece of trash,

1282
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:02,700
I thought he was gonna say, when I see a
piece of trash, man, I go and pick it up.

1283
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:07,500
And he said, he said something along
the lines of, when I see a preset trash,

1284
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:11,570
I'm frustrated that nobody picked it up.
And think about the,

1285
01:21:11,571 --> 01:21:13,620
the impact of those two
statements. If he said, well,

1286
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:15,480
I thought he was going
to say, which is, hey,

1287
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:19,410
when I see a piece of trash on the floor,
I go over and I pick it up and,

1288
01:21:19,460 --> 01:21:21,360
and put it away or throw it away.

1289
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:25,320
And then I make sure there's no the trash
near cause I want this ship to shine.

1290
01:21:25,350 --> 01:21:30,090
That's one thing. He, he said, hey,
when I see a piece of trash on the ship,

1291
01:21:30,091 --> 01:21:33,270
I get so frustrated that
you weren't cleaning it up.

1292
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,760
And I was so let down at that ship that,

1293
01:21:35,761 --> 01:21:40,290
that commanding officers said that
at that shit. Uh, but to your point,

1294
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,310
if you know,
it's like,

1295
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:46,230
the reason I thought of that is because
you can see when even when I've been in,

1296
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:46,980
you know,

1297
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,810
the commander of a unit of some kind and
I would see when I walk in unexpected,

1298
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:54,750
there's like a change, you know?
And it's not always, you know,

1299
01:21:54,751 --> 01:21:57,910
sometimes I've seen it where guys,
the commander walks in and it's,

1300
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,660
people are doing that cause of fear.
Right? Right. Yeah. That's not different.

1301
01:22:00,661 --> 01:22:04,860
That's not what we're looking for. Or
You want to say, oh, the boss is here.

1302
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:07,830
I don't want him to see that this
is going on. I don't know. This is,

1303
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:10,530
we shouldn't be doing that. We
should. And that's, you're right.

1304
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:14,070
That is a real powerful,
real powerful

1305
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:20,190
fought that he puts in here about
how when when the boss comes around,

1306
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,110
when the commander comes around and you,

1307
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:27,290
and it actually provides the troopers
the ability to see what he's seeing and

1308
01:22:27,301 --> 01:22:30,970
how powerful that is. Wellington,
Jane, I forget what it,

1309
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:32,820
he had to do the thing where it's like,

1310
01:22:32,821 --> 01:22:35,640
it was like a 10th thing and he was
just telling, I was telling him, oh,

1311
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:38,090
he's talking to Sarah about it
and he's like, yeah, I'm gonna,

1312
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:40,980
I'm gonna leave like right after that
cause I don't want to have to face like

1313
01:22:40,981 --> 01:22:44,700
some awkwardness or something like that.
And then, um, kind of once there I left,

1314
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:47,880
I was like, Hey, I'm going to tell
Jocko that you're going to do that.

1315
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,830
And he was like, all like, he knew I was
joking, but he was like, ah, you know,

1316
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:55,500
Kinda like, what would you think about
that? You're not even as loss by the way,

1317
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:59,900
obviously, but it's kind of
like that thing, you know,
like, Hey, whoa. Would like, um,

1318
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:04,410
you ever watch, remember commando?
Yeah. It's not, yeah, go ahead.

1319
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:10,990
There's this part right where the
story behind commando is one of his,

1320
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:15,880
his guys that he trained and
stuff, um, went rogue, went back,

1321
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,210
came back and they thought he was dead
and he comes back and he helps you know,

1322
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:23,710
the, you know, great, great
story. It's dope. Anyway. Um,

1323
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:26,940
so this, this bad guy
now he, you could stay,

1324
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:31,150
you could tell he still has
all this admiration for,
for his name's John Matrix.

1325
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:33,460
For Arnold. Yeah, for our
logo. Cause he's like,

1326
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:36,460
he's walking around the compound
that he's kind of like, you know,

1327
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:39,550
and all these guys are like talk,
talking to and stuff.

1328
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:44,020
So he goes to the other boss that
he's now working with. Um, he's all,

1329
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:48,100
it's, it's funny to hear your men
talk tough. It makes me laugh.

1330
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:51,310
If Matrix was here, he'd laugh
too, you know, kind of like he's,

1331
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:54,190
it's almost like human matrix are
on the same team still. You know,

1332
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,360
he knows how he would see that. You know,
it's kind of that same thing. Presence.

1333
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:02,620
Awesome. Uh, so

1334
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:06,560
wrapping that rough transition,

1335
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:11,630
people want to support the podcast.
How are they going to do it?

1336
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:16,130
Echo Charles? Well, one way,

1337
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:21,820
the way I like to recommend one of the
many is by supporting yourself at the

1338
01:24:23,541 --> 01:24:25,550
same time on it.
Supplements.

1339
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:30,410
And where are your bars on a
dotcom slash Jack will get 10% off

1340
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:34,280
before this podcast.

1341
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:40,800
I'll make it short before the spot
gas and when I get a shroom tech,

1342
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:48,010
I didn't get 10% off.
Not You can get 10% off.

1343
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,600
Or if you shop at Amazon,

1344
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:52,580
a click through our websites is
another way you can support podcasts.

1345
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:56,920
A click through our websites,
Amazon, the link, our websites.

1346
01:24:56,950 --> 01:25:01,540
That's Jocko podcast.com and Jocko
store.com there's a little thing you can

1347
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,430
click on. Yup. Yup.

1348
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:07,660
And you can support that way cause it's
like thing it doesn't count. Does not,

1349
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:11,050
it barely costs you time. Barely. Really?

1350
01:25:11,051 --> 01:25:15,110
The thing is remembering to go there.
Yeah.

1351
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:19,300
So that's kind of the thing.
Oh, good solution to that.
Yes. Which we do have now.

1352
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:23,440
Little trooper tool trooper
tool is what it's called. Uh,

1353
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:27,100
it's this cool little thing and
it's on the website as well.

1354
01:25:27,101 --> 01:25:29,860
It's as a trooper tool,
chrome extension, boom,

1355
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:34,510
click on it puts a little icon on the
top of your browser and it automatically

1356
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,260
affiliates your Amazon experience with,

1357
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:42,950
with US support passive roofers passively?
No.

1358
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:48,190
Passively as opposed task deciliter.
No, no, no. It's aggressive. Yes.

1359
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:52,810
But it's not. So yeah. All right.
Passive means you didn't do anything.

1360
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:54,580
It's,
we have,

1361
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:58,330
we have troopers out there that are
aggressively shopping on Amazon to support

1362
01:25:58,331 --> 01:26:03,010
the podcast. And I dig
that. I read that sometimes

1363
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:09,390
my friends on Twitter,
they'll send me like a screen shot,

1364
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:14,260
boom of their trooper tool or their,
or their little purchase. Like, Hey,

1365
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:17,540
I bought this stuff tape, here's
my thing. And it's a screenshot.

1366
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,650
Yeah. It really makes me feel
empowered and I'm not joking. Right.

1367
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,410
It does help the podcast
fully appreciate it.

1368
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:31,130
Fully subscribe to the
podcast of course iTunes.

1369
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:35,450
And then on youtube as well.
I'm slowly putting more videos.

1370
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:39,610
I'll put a few and keep putting more.
Oh,

1371
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:44,000
so you're not just stuck watching the
podcast, which is cool too, by the way,

1372
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:49,490
if you're into watching it and listening
is sometimes like people will put it on

1373
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:51,170
their screen as they work out,
you know,

1374
01:26:51,171 --> 01:26:53,720
so they can kind of watch lists
and workout watch lists, you know,

1375
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,740
it's a good little little formula anyway.
Yeah, youtube is a good one as well.

1376
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:02,720
And of course the Jocko store if you like,
you know,

1377
01:27:02,721 --> 01:27:06,170
shirts and whatnot, coffee mugs,
stickers. Um, they're pretty cool.

1378
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:10,340
I've got some great feedback.
One announcement.

1379
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:18,900
We have women's stuff coming
out in about what week or two

1380
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,710
female troopers.
Yup.

1381
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,740
Who have been pressuring
strongly recommending will
say consistently strongly

1382
01:27:31,041 --> 01:27:35,600
are up recommending. Yup. Yeah, they're
good ones. Uh, I chose three colors.

1383
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:40,070
You're going to have to wait and see
which ones they are and when they do come

1384
01:27:40,071 --> 01:27:42,350
out, give me more feedback. I
want to narrow it down to the,

1385
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:47,570
the stuff that we all want. So
yeah, go ahead. Do that. Jocko.

1386
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:50,180
store.com there's some cool
stuff. If you like it, boom.

1387
01:27:50,630 --> 01:27:54,350
Get one or two or however many.
And that supports as well.

1388
01:27:54,830 --> 01:27:58,650
And plus that means I don't have to buy
my wife anything. Yeah, I'll just give it.

1389
01:27:58,660 --> 01:28:00,760
Yeah,
I'll say one teachers.

1390
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,060
That's actually one of the good
reasons I like managing this stuff.

1391
01:28:05,061 --> 01:28:07,610
I don't have to, not that I really
bought shirts that much anyway,

1392
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:12,170
but I have a bunch of shirts. No
plus maybe my daughters too. Yeah.

1393
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:16,730
Perfect. We're good. Yep. Good to go.
Everybody's good to go. Are they regular?

1394
01:28:16,731 --> 01:28:20,360
Are these the same design or is it
something new? It's there. Yeah.

1395
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:21,980
They're more or less the same,
but they're,

1396
01:28:22,570 --> 01:28:25,360
they're basically the wounds
version of what we got it.

1397
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,020
I started with a
discipline equals freedom.

1398
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:30,470
I might just do one for
women because let's face it,

1399
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:35,650
we all get get after it in pretty much
the same way except for every once in a

1400
01:28:35,771 --> 01:28:36,081
while.

1401
01:28:36,081 --> 01:28:41,081
Women get after it in a different way
every once in a while so it might be worth

1402
01:28:41,331 --> 01:28:45,170
it to give them a little
something different and special.

1403
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,340
Just my opinion, I don't.
Awesome. All right, there you go.

1404
01:28:49,430 --> 01:28:50,750
That's always the support.

1405
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:57,820
Support that podcast and with
that question number one,

1406
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:05,680
I a marine corps vet only four years
and I recently hired another marine.

1407
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:11,640
He had a great reputation and a
lot of experience as NCO leader,

1408
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:15,150
gunny sergeant,
but he's not doing well in our company.

1409
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,500
He only seems to lead through
fear. Slash. Authority.

1410
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:22,590
It isn't working cause high standards,
which I like,

1411
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:27,060
but he's not gaining the respect of
his team or the rest of the company.

1412
01:29:27,810 --> 01:29:29,670
What's going on and how can I fix it?

1413
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:36,990
This is kind of a classic
case and unfortunately it's
an unfortunate case too.

1414
01:29:38,351 --> 01:29:43,351
And what we have here is an example of a
guy that's probably pretty charismatic.

1415
01:29:44,741 --> 01:29:47,350
He's probably pretty aggressive.
He's probably pretty loud.

1416
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:50,050
He's probably pretty authoritative.
He's probably pretty smart.

1417
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:53,290
He's probably physically impressive.
In other words,

1418
01:29:53,291 --> 01:29:58,291
he's probably got a lot of natural good
leadership traits and I surmise in a

1419
01:30:02,681 --> 01:30:03,640
situation like this,

1420
01:30:03,641 --> 01:30:08,641
that is the type of person that took the
basics of what the military taught him

1421
01:30:08,741 --> 01:30:10,390
and utilized it to lead.

1422
01:30:10,391 --> 01:30:15,391
And so what he did was he
used imposed discipline.

1423
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:18,880
That's what guy used on him
and that's what he used.

1424
01:30:18,881 --> 01:30:22,150
So it's the things that we just
talked about, it's intimidation.

1425
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:27,900
It's the whole thing with maneuver
warfare versus attrition warfare that the

1426
01:30:28,031 --> 01:30:31,960
military still teaches,
unfortunately,

1427
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,740
that the job of leaders is to obey orders
and ensure orders are obeyed. Okay.

1428
01:30:38,741 --> 01:30:42,880
That's, that's what the military,
unfortunately in some cases,

1429
01:30:42,881 --> 01:30:45,400
teachers and you can go through your
career and that's what you can kind of

1430
01:30:45,401 --> 01:30:45,880
learn.

1431
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:50,260
Or you can have some good leadership
inside the military that teaches you the

1432
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,110
better way,
the way to actually lead.

1433
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,200
And so,
but if you're,

1434
01:30:56,201 --> 01:31:01,201
if you're raised that the way that your
job as a leader is to obey orders and to

1435
01:31:02,241 --> 01:31:05,290
ensure that orders are obeyed. If
that's your job, how do you do that?

1436
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,070
Will you do it through blunt force trauma?
That's how you do it.

1437
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:12,100
And as I've said before,

1438
01:31:12,101 --> 01:31:16,150
that does work for a time period.

1439
01:31:16,151 --> 01:31:17,350
It does get the job done.

1440
01:31:17,351 --> 01:31:22,351
It's micromanagement and fortunately
or unfortunately in the military,

1441
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:27,930
you've got people that rapidly
cycle through leadership positions.

1442
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:32,800
And so it's not like you are permanently
in charge of the same group of people.

1443
01:31:32,801 --> 01:31:37,300
So you can kind of get away
with it because you do a
workup and it don't work of

1444
01:31:37,301 --> 01:31:37,781
a stressful,

1445
01:31:37,781 --> 01:31:40,330
and then you go on deployment to 20 it's
only six months long and by the time

1446
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:43,690
you're done, everybody hates you, but it's
okay, you're moving onto your next job.

1447
01:31:44,650 --> 01:31:47,440
And so that's how people survive.

1448
01:31:47,470 --> 01:31:52,300
And what really hurts about this is
because they survive that leadership

1449
01:31:52,301 --> 01:31:56,290
position, it actually reinforces
that type of leadership behavior,

1450
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:59,200
which is not good.
But what they do is if,

1451
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:04,180
if let's say you do it,
it just an American kind of mindset of,

1452
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:07,570
hey, if some is good, more is better.

1453
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:09,400
And so they take this,

1454
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:14,200
this attitude and they become more,

1455
01:32:14,290 --> 01:32:16,900
more aggressive.
They impose more discipline,

1456
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:21,901
they raise the standards to ridiculous
level where it's no longer even sensible.

1457
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:24,070
Yeah.

1458
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:27,130
Where things just become
stupid like we used to say.

1459
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,520
So I don't know why they called us,

1460
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:32,980
but in the military they called a pushup
position, the front leaning rest. Sure.

1461
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,620
Front leaning rest. I
don't know why, but I,

1462
01:32:35,621 --> 01:32:39,950
and then they also use the
term forward leaning, meaning,
Hey, we want to be ahead.

1463
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,510
We want to be ready, ready,
prepared. And I used to say,

1464
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,640
let's not be so far forward leaning
that were in the leaning rest.

1465
01:32:49,210 --> 01:32:51,730
Meaning that we're leaning so far
forward that we're wasting our energy and

1466
01:32:51,731 --> 01:32:55,770
getting tired and sore. At a certain
point it can become stupid thing.

1467
01:32:55,780 --> 01:33:00,070
An example of this would be like, um,
a uniform inspections. Like, okay,

1468
01:33:00,071 --> 01:33:01,570
you got to have a square to a uniform.
You know,

1469
01:33:01,571 --> 01:33:04,240
you got to be able to break out uniform,
look sharp.

1470
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,860
Well if you do that every day,

1471
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:10,360
you're wasting time because it's
not the most important thing. It,

1472
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:13,750
it does have a level of importance
somewhere on the hierarchy of important

1473
01:33:13,751 --> 01:33:17,500
things, not real high,
but there's some people,

1474
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:21,700
if you're a strict military
disciplinarian, you might think,

1475
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:24,130
I need to have uniform instruction every
single day cause my guys are going to

1476
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:24,964
look the best.

1477
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:28,630
And so you've got a bunch of guys that
not only are they wasting time prepping

1478
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:31,600
their uniform and paying
for them a uniform get dry
cleaned and they're actually

1479
01:33:32,050 --> 01:33:35,440
using their uniform is so much their
dress uniforms so much that they're

1480
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:39,520
providing wear and tear on it. And
so it's just, it's just stupid.

1481
01:33:39,550 --> 01:33:43,990
It doesn't make any sense.
So that's,

1482
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:47,080
that's what they do. They, these
leaders that have been raised like that,

1483
01:33:47,081 --> 01:33:49,840
they start to do it even more.
And it just,

1484
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:54,790
it defeats its own purpose in most
important is that these leaders start to

1485
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:59,650
stifle free fought from
their subordinates.

1486
01:34:00,180 --> 01:34:00,800
Okay.

1487
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,350
And eventually,
and this is even more critical,

1488
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:08,420
eventually they begin to stifle
free thought from their own brain.

1489
01:34:10,270 --> 01:34:13,510
And that's likely what happened
in a situation like this.

1490
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:15,670
And you know,

1491
01:34:15,671 --> 01:34:18,940
you've got a guy that again was raised
in this attitude and he took that

1492
01:34:18,941 --> 01:34:23,080
attitude and he amplified that attitude
and that is how he was successful.

1493
01:34:23,081 --> 01:34:25,120
And he amplified it even more.
And he ends up,

1494
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:26,470
now he breaks out of the Marine Corps.

1495
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,200
Well now it's not just
a six month appointment.

1496
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:30,460
You got to lead people for
years and years and years.

1497
01:34:30,461 --> 01:34:34,930
And you've got to go from
different various projects
and all these personalities.

1498
01:34:34,931 --> 01:34:39,490
And, and it's a more sensitive environment
because it's in the civilian sector in

1499
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:42,100
lives aren't necessarily,
it's steak.

1500
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,710
And so what do you need to do?

1501
01:34:45,730 --> 01:34:46,150
Okay,

1502
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:48,780
what,
what you need him to see.

1503
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:51,740
So now I'm talking to the leader
that asked this question, what,

1504
01:34:51,790 --> 01:34:53,020
what can you do to help?
Well,

1505
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:57,980
what you need that former marine
gunnery sergeant to do. What

1506
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:02,980
you need him to see is that
the next level of leadership,

1507
01:35:05,061 --> 01:35:10,061
the next progression along the spectrum
of leadership is not more of all that.

1508
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:15,950
It's actually less.

1509
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:21,020
It's not more imposed discipline
on your troops. It's actually less.

1510
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:26,021
It's the troops having free thought
and self discipline and it is not you

1511
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:31,070
leading more.
It is actually you leading less.

1512
01:35:32,090 --> 01:35:37,090
Eat is not you taking more ownership
is you taking less ownership and your

1513
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:39,620
troops taking more ownership.

1514
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:44,000
It is him giving guidance,

1515
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:48,560
giving commander's intent
and then stepping back,

1516
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:54,160
it is him not being the focus because a
lot of times when you're in a leadership

1517
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:59,261
position that can be any ego feeder
and all of a sudden you want to be the

1518
01:36:00,681 --> 01:36:02,480
center of attention.
You want to be in the spotlight,

1519
01:36:04,370 --> 01:36:08,950
but you don't want to be that.
You want to be less of that and it,

1520
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:11,180
and I'm telling you so
that's what you gotta do.

1521
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:15,710
You gotta open his eyes to what the
next level of leadership looks like.

1522
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:19,520
He's never had that open for him.
And I'm going to tell you right now,

1523
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:23,600
it's going to be hard to get them there
because there's a good chance that he's

1524
01:36:23,601 --> 01:36:28,601
a hard person to coach because he's been
successful with the techniques that he

1525
01:36:28,761 --> 01:36:31,400
learned and he has experience and he's,
and that,

1526
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:36,580
that experience has strengthened his
resolve and his belief in his leadership

1527
01:36:38,061 --> 01:36:41,540
technique. It's, it's,
it's a tough situation.

1528
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,480
So you're likely going to have
to take an indirect approach.

1529
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:49,910
And so for instance,
here's a good one. Hey,

1530
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:53,900
I was wondering, you know who, who's going
to take your place when it's, you know,

1531
01:36:53,901 --> 01:36:57,420
when it's time for promotion, who
you grooming to fill your shoes? Hmm.

1532
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:00,070
Cause guess what? He's
not grooming anybody. Hmm.

1533
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:06,400
Or you ask him how much time he's spending
looking up and out at what's going on

1534
01:37:08,901 --> 01:37:12,740
in the strategic as opposed to down
and Ian that his own little element.

1535
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:14,623
Yeah.

1536
01:37:14,790 --> 01:37:19,560
And the other thing that you could do
is assign him some higher level projects

1537
01:37:19,561 --> 01:37:23,100
that actually pull him out
of the micromanagement weeds

1538
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:30,620
and maybe even put him on projects
with people that don't micromanage.

1539
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,470
Hmm. And and good leaders
that lead in a good way,

1540
01:37:34,471 --> 01:37:38,640
put him on some kind of project with
them so he can see what that looks like.

1541
01:37:39,850 --> 01:37:40,510
Okay.

1542
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:45,220
And obviously these are just some
suggestions of approaches because you're

1543
01:37:45,221 --> 01:37:47,410
probably going to have to,
you'll,

1544
01:37:47,411 --> 01:37:52,411
you'll have to adapt those and
figure out exactly how to walk him

1545
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,380
to the end state,
which the end state,

1546
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:01,830
the commander's intent from me is
you want to teach him what the next,

1547
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:03,600
what the next level,

1548
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:09,320
the next advancement of leadership skill
for him is and it's something that's

1549
01:38:10,861 --> 01:38:12,990
the opposite of what he learned.
So

1550
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:21,120
good challenge. Yeah. Yeah. That,

1551
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,013
that,

1552
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:25,580
that leading from authority
thing and fear and authority.

1553
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:31,070
It's almost like it's so black and
white where when someone does that,

1554
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:32,210
it's so clear.

1555
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:36,650
It's very clear and it's very addictive
person because there's immediate

1556
01:38:36,651 --> 01:38:41,210
gratification. I told you to do it
and so they do it and then OKC worked,

1557
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,700
kind of takes less work to a
lot of the time keep us work.

1558
01:38:46,701 --> 01:38:49,550
You don't have to invest in relationships,
you don't have to invest in,

1559
01:38:49,820 --> 01:38:53,660
in indirect approaches on things.
Of course it takes less work. It's,

1560
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:58,430
it's real simple. You know, you can kind
of give into your temper sometimes too.

1561
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:01,520
Yeah. You're temper is a little
bit of a tool with that kind of,

1562
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:06,290
the problem is over time these,
that type of leadership doesn't work.

1563
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,100
You want to be with the beloved
captain who never lost his temper,

1564
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,390
who never yelled at his men and yet who
would follow him into the fires of hell.

1565
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:19,170
Yup.
Next question.

1566
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:27,400
If you had a leader at work he did not
respect and know is ineffective and

1567
01:39:27,441 --> 01:39:30,080
you've communicated that Tim,
yet when they see you,

1568
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:33,200
they tried to shake your hand,

1569
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:38,660
how would you react and how would
you deny their handshake offering?

1570
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:45,440
Appreciate the feedback. So,
um, okay. This is just off the,

1571
01:39:45,441 --> 01:39:50,240
off the mark. I hope people realize
that this is, no, it's okay. I mean,

1572
01:39:50,241 --> 01:39:54,500
I understand the reason I put this in
there just because this is what we talked

1573
01:39:54,501 --> 01:39:58,490
about earlier where you think,
man, I'm holding the line and I'm,

1574
01:39:58,610 --> 01:40:02,380
I'm holding the line and this is my
expectations of a leader and you don't fit

1575
01:40:02,381 --> 01:40:04,670
it. The song went to number one,
I'm gonna tell you number two,

1576
01:40:04,671 --> 01:40:06,950
if you're trying to shake my hand,
you're not getting it. Right, right.

1577
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:12,040
So that's what we call an adversarial
relationship and it is not what we want.

1578
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:13,340
How,
let me ask you this.

1579
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:17,540
How is this going to help your cause to
have an error adversarial relationship

1580
01:40:17,541 --> 01:40:18,860
with your boss?
How does it help your cost?

1581
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,540
Is he going to listen to you more or less?

1582
01:40:21,470 --> 01:40:23,660
Is he going to support you more or less?

1583
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:27,200
Will he give you what
you want more or less?

1584
01:40:27,201 --> 01:40:30,800
Which one you won't shake his hand

1585
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:35,270
and you think he's going to
support you in any way? No.

1586
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:39,650
And furthermore,
is he,

1587
01:40:39,651 --> 01:40:42,200
if you have an adversarial
relationship with your boss,

1588
01:40:42,260 --> 01:40:46,190
is he more likely to promote you into
position where you can have more control

1589
01:40:46,191 --> 01:40:49,160
over decisions for the team
and for your own future?

1590
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,890
What do you think the answer to that is?
Negative.

1591
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:56,680
All those answers are obvious.
This

1592
01:40:58,270 --> 01:41:01,300
whole concept is wrong.

1593
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:07,050
Our job is to build a relationship with
our boss and honestly with everyone else

1594
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:08,900
for that matter.

1595
01:41:08,900 --> 01:41:13,900
That's what we're trying to do straight
up disrespecting the boss or again,

1596
01:41:15,290 --> 01:41:18,820
anyone is not going to help our cause.
It's going to hurt it.

1597
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:20,783
Now,

1598
01:41:22,170 --> 01:41:24,390
this doesn't mean that we're kissing ass.

1599
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:28,500
This doesn't mean that we're full being,
it doesn't mean that we're weak.

1600
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:29,550
This is the,
this is the,

1601
01:41:29,551 --> 01:41:34,080
this is the challenge for me to convince
people that want to be strong leaders,

1602
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:39,350
that this doesn't mean that you are
weak and actually takes more strength to

1603
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:46,140
control your emotions. It takes more
strength to remain professional.

1604
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:51,141
It takes more strength to focus on the
long term win and not the short term

1605
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:53,700
frustration.

1606
01:41:53,970 --> 01:41:58,970
It takes more strength to keep your ego
in check and I would say that this whole

1607
01:42:04,351 --> 01:42:09,180
question is a good is a,
is an indicator to me.

1608
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:13,990
I might need to check my own ego.
Okay. Am I critical of my boss?

1609
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:18,540
Am I critical because of my boss?
Because I'm a little bit jealous.

1610
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:19,863
Is that possible?

1611
01:42:20,430 --> 01:42:25,430
Am I critical of my boss because I think
I deserve the job more than they do.

1612
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,970
Do I think that my boss got lucky or he,

1613
01:42:30,180 --> 01:42:33,600
he's a brown noser or
he's favored some way.

1614
01:42:33,601 --> 01:42:37,470
That's why he got it and I'm going to
be bitter about it and therefore I'm not

1615
01:42:37,471 --> 01:42:42,240
going to respect him. All
those right there, ego talking,

1616
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:46,710
right full on ego talking.
So you got to put the ego in check.

1617
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:50,130
You got to support the boss and
you got to support the team,

1618
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:52,380
then that's the best way to support
the Boston support the team.

1619
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:57,770
And the obvious caveat to this is if the
boss is doing something that's illegal

1620
01:42:59,191 --> 01:43:03,360
or immoral or unethical, then
fine. Yeah, of course. Absolutely.

1621
01:43:03,361 --> 01:43:07,680
You can call them out,
you can deny his handshake,

1622
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:10,350
you can report them up the chain
of command or to the authorities.

1623
01:43:10,830 --> 01:43:14,160
Because if you're part of what
he's doing and you know it,

1624
01:43:14,161 --> 01:43:18,870
then you're complicit in the activities.
So you're at risk anyways

1625
01:43:20,370 --> 01:43:24,760
and it's the right thing to do. So
obviously in those cases, yeah, you,

1626
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,580
you can hold your ground.
But barring those extreme circumstances,

1627
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:33,540
what you wanna do with your bosses,
build the relationship. And again,

1628
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:37,620
it's not just your boss, it's your peers.
It's your chain of command up and down.

1629
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,610
You want to build those relationships
instead of breaking them.

1630
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:44,793
Yeah.

1631
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:47,660
Yeah. It seems, it's so funny, not funny,

1632
01:43:47,661 --> 01:43:50,960
but it's interesting how when you
lay it out, and I'm sure a lot,

1633
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,050
maybe even when he's listening to this,

1634
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:57,830
just hearing this question out
loud, it seems obvious, you know,

1635
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:02,660
but really you're trying to think about
yourself in this situation where yeah,

1636
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:06,020
you don't like this guy and maybe said
some stuff to offend you even and you

1637
01:44:06,021 --> 01:44:09,050
don't respect them obviously.
So yeah.

1638
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:10,610
Like you don't want to
shake this guy's hand,

1639
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:15,290
like how you feel is a lot of times
what dictates your behavior, you know,

1640
01:44:15,410 --> 01:44:19,730
towards people and just otherwise.
Um, so when you're in the situation,

1641
01:44:19,731 --> 01:44:23,720
this is kind of like, it's
so hard to be like, yeah,

1642
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:26,900
I don't respect his whole methods.
I don't like any of this stuff.

1643
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:30,000
He's going to come shake my hand.
It's so hard to be like, sure. And,

1644
01:44:30,001 --> 01:44:33,140
and do what you're talking about.
It can be put your ego in check,

1645
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:37,850
put your emotions in check, put your
attitude in check and just go, hey boss,

1646
01:44:37,851 --> 01:44:41,900
how's it going today? Yup,
everything's going good here. Yeah,

1647
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,860
so I appreciate the support you've been
given us. There's one decision you made.

1648
01:44:45,861 --> 01:44:47,030
I was kinda wondering about.

1649
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,940
I'd love to give love to pick your
brain on and some point. Oh really?

1650
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:54,650
Whereas if I just go, I don't want
to shake your hand. I hate you.

1651
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:59,420
I basically disrespect you and
I hate you and what you do,

1652
01:44:59,421 --> 01:45:01,220
decision you made over here was wrong.
Is he going to listen to me?

1653
01:45:01,310 --> 01:45:03,320
There's no chance.
There's no chance you're going to wait.

1654
01:45:03,321 --> 01:45:07,550
You're gonna lose the argument. Me,
when I go in there and I say, hey boss,

1655
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,680
how's it going? Yes.
Yeah, no problem. Hey, I,

1656
01:45:09,681 --> 01:45:12,170
one thing I wanted to pick your brain
about, this decision you made over here,

1657
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:15,500
is he going to listen to me? You've got
a better chance. Still might say no,

1658
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:19,000
but guess what? I'm fighting along war.
I'm gonna outlast him out. Work them.

1659
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:22,280
I'm going to out maneuver him. My boss
is going to do what I'm wanting to do.

1660
01:45:22,670 --> 01:45:27,470
I know him. Yeah. You got to keep that
in mind, man, because when you're in it,

1661
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,930
when you lose that little better
cause really that's what it is.

1662
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,270
When you're shaking your hand and
you're like in your head, you're like,

1663
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:34,190
I hate you.
I don't want to shake your hand.

1664
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:37,390
Freaking get your hand out of my feet.
Your whole existence of your hand,

1665
01:45:37,410 --> 01:45:41,210
front of my face is an insult. That's
what you're thinking. So if you shake it,

1666
01:45:41,211 --> 01:45:44,210
you lost that battle and
that's bad right there for you.

1667
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:46,730
That's what it feels bad.
It's, it's, it's very,

1668
01:45:46,731 --> 01:45:51,600
very immature when it,
it just feels right at the,

1669
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,260
at the time. But if you let
your emotions get all crazy,

1670
01:45:54,610 --> 01:45:58,700
if you're not being strategic,
that's everything. Not
Thinking about winning. Yeah,

1671
01:45:58,790 --> 01:46:03,500
and by no means they might say playing
the game correctly, but the point is,

1672
01:46:03,501 --> 01:46:06,410
I understand that you feel as good as
when you say it out loud, it's like,

1673
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:10,250
oh my gosh, it's so clear. Almost
he doesn't. He know what you, you,

1674
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:15,350
you just indicated to me something
very obvious is that over time,

1675
01:46:16,250 --> 01:46:21,140
you know over time you get to the, okay,
you go for a hard workout and you get to,

1676
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:24,880
you look forward to the feeling afterwards
of debt. Yeah, I did this hard workout.

1677
01:46:24,881 --> 01:46:26,030
There's endorphins or whatever.

1678
01:46:26,570 --> 01:46:31,570
I'm going to tell you at some point I
developed some sort of attitude where when

1679
01:46:31,581 --> 01:46:35,510
I do, when I control myself and
I make a good strategic move,

1680
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:39,380
if he's just as good, it feels way
better than the short term. Aw Man.

1681
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:43,370
I really told him no, no. Wrong
answer. You lost, you won the battle.

1682
01:46:43,371 --> 01:46:47,120
Lost the war idiot. That's what I
feel like if I make that mistake.

1683
01:46:47,570 --> 01:46:50,100
That's absolutely correct.
Don't leave you conditioned

1684
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,810
yourself to the whole process.
You know,

1685
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:53,310
cause he probably went
through it a few times,

1686
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:57,770
tasted the fruits of winning the law
and so it's just with experience that

1687
01:46:57,771 --> 01:47:00,090
exactly right. Exactly right. So,

1688
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:04,170
and there's ways you can
kind of do that to yourself.

1689
01:47:04,171 --> 01:47:07,490
Like I do if like even if you haven't,
like ultimately when,

1690
01:47:07,540 --> 01:47:11,340
when you boil kind of your whole way of
thinking down when you do have an ego

1691
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:13,470
that you think is like a functional ego,

1692
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:16,580
but use that ego to win the long words.

1693
01:47:16,581 --> 01:47:20,430
So let's kind of like what I did with
getting mad. It's like no one can like my,

1694
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:23,110
like no one's going to tell me I have
low self esteem because really, you know,

1695
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:26,160
angry, angry shoes is usually
because of low self esteem.

1696
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:28,890
So in this case you could be like,
hey,

1697
01:47:28,891 --> 01:47:33,540
if you ever facilitate that adversarial
relationship where you don't shake his

1698
01:47:33,541 --> 01:47:38,430
hand or you're like, you want to, as he
said, you've communicated that to him.

1699
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:42,990
You have a leader that you don't respect
and you know as an effective and you

1700
01:47:42,991 --> 01:47:46,410
told them, okay, so keep that.
When you say stuff like that,

1701
01:47:46,440 --> 01:47:48,620
consider that as like your weakness.

1702
01:47:48,660 --> 01:47:52,170
Like just tell yourself that whether
it is or they say that's your weakness,

1703
01:47:52,171 --> 01:47:56,220
but forgetting the long war and for and
for showing your cards that showing your

1704
01:47:56,221 --> 01:48:00,330
credit. Yes. Yeah. Just, it's this little
internal thing you'd tell yourself.

1705
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:03,270
And then just like how you were
saying where you feel dumb,

1706
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:06,330
you give your ego can't handle that,
can handle all that.

1707
01:48:06,420 --> 01:48:09,420
Then I'll go back to my point that I said,
this doesn't mean you're weak.

1708
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:13,140
It means that you are winning.
Yeah.

1709
01:48:13,230 --> 01:48:16,500
But flip it around as far as what
you'd tell yourself. Like he, you know,

1710
01:48:16,501 --> 01:48:19,800
it feels we to lose a small
battle. I understand, but
flip it around and say, hey,

1711
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:23,430
you know, if you win it at the expense
of the long, that means you're weak.

1712
01:48:23,431 --> 01:48:26,970
Say that to yourself and it'll get
easier. You know, you're rushing yourself.

1713
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:31,560
If you lose the long term battle,
you're even more week. Yes.

1714
01:48:31,650 --> 01:48:33,990
That's the big weakness.
Weakness.

1715
01:48:35,670 --> 01:48:40,320
All right,
next question for the podcast.

1716
01:48:42,260 --> 01:48:46,190
What would ajiaco school for boys
and girls, eight to 16 years old,

1717
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:51,500
this should be interesting. What would
that look like? Schedule Subjects,

1718
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:52,730
physical education.
Sure.

1719
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:56,950
So first of all,
I would love to do this and it's,

1720
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:01,790
you're seeing one day I w I may do
this lord of the flies. Yes. Um, uh,

1721
01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:05,240
I, I actually really do relate
to kids for some reason.

1722
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:09,200
And I think a school,

1723
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:12,950
I think as I think I could develop
a school that would be awesome and

1724
01:49:12,951 --> 01:49:17,570
outstanding and would
produce really stable,

1725
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:21,380
strong,
mentally capable

1726
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:28,300
children for the world. So, and so,

1727
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:31,670
I was so happy when I saw this question
and I've actually looked and I've

1728
01:49:31,671 --> 01:49:35,770
actually, I've actually pondered the
ideas of, you know, buying a house,

1729
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:37,790
buying a piece of property,
you know,

1730
01:49:37,791 --> 01:49:40,970
what it would cost maybe getting some
investors together that we're going to

1731
01:49:40,971 --> 01:49:44,210
build a scar. I mean, I've literally,
I've actually looked for property,

1732
01:49:44,211 --> 01:49:46,790
which is something I do all the time, but
I've looked for property and said, okay,

1733
01:49:46,791 --> 01:49:51,700
this probably work. So, uh, like, uh,
like almost like an extension school,

1734
01:49:51,701 --> 01:49:55,530
like in the little [inaudible] academy,
like a school that you go to, right.

1735
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:59,890
And you and we, we, what we
could probably do is do like a,

1736
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:04,840
instead of a, hey, you're gonna go
here from sixth grade to graduation,

1737
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:08,170
you go for like one year,

1738
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:11,350
you go one year here you go
back to your regular school,

1739
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:12,880
after you've been in
the school for a year,

1740
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:15,320
three to go back to your regular school,
you're going to totally dominate.

1741
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:19,750
You're going to be number one.
You're going to learn so much more.

1742
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:22,270
It's just going to be awesome.
So we will need to bring,

1743
01:50:22,690 --> 01:50:25,630
we wouldn't need to bring these young,
these,

1744
01:50:25,631 --> 01:50:30,250
these children into the school for,
for the entire time because you know,

1745
01:50:30,251 --> 01:50:30,821
you could go out,

1746
01:50:30,821 --> 01:50:35,821
back out into the regular
world and overlay what you
learned at the academy and

1747
01:50:38,411 --> 01:50:42,760
you would just dominate. And so, um, yeah,

1748
01:50:42,761 --> 01:50:46,960
maybe I'll end up doing that
someday and the schedule,

1749
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:48,940
I mean I think I didn't
spend that much time on it.

1750
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:52,510
It doesn't really even take
that much time to figure out,

1751
01:50:52,511 --> 01:50:55,450
cause you know what we're doing.
We're waking up very early in the morning.

1752
01:50:55,480 --> 01:51:00,430
We're doing a hardcore PT,
some kind of sports variety of sports.

1753
01:51:00,431 --> 01:51:04,570
Guess what, we're playing every sport,
you know, baseball, basketball, swimming,

1754
01:51:04,571 --> 01:51:07,200
football, soccer, wrestling,
judo, boxing at we're new,

1755
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:09,860
a little bit of everything
that's going to happen really.

1756
01:51:10,180 --> 01:51:13,930
I mean obviously we're getting up at four
30. We are up before the sun gets up.

1757
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:18,490
I mean that's the way it is.
And then we get the knowledge.

1758
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:21,220
So we'd go into the classrooms,
the classrooms,

1759
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:25,930
W I w I would get instructors that will
full on engaged in what they're doing

1760
01:51:25,931 --> 01:51:30,931
just in the game that love their subject
and that can relate it to the world.

1761
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,720
And most important,

1762
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:39,490
cause I think this is what's lacking
sometime most important through all the

1763
01:51:39,491 --> 01:51:41,050
different knowledge courses.

1764
01:51:41,051 --> 01:51:46,051
So all the basic knowledge there would
be a common thread that connects them all

1765
01:51:49,511 --> 01:51:52,930
together because that's what I
think people are missing that a lot.

1766
01:51:52,931 --> 01:51:57,810
I think we miss that, that
underlying theme of, uh,

1767
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:02,080
through our educational system.
But I think when you connect everything,

1768
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:05,980
they're more powerful. Like when you
connect math to science, to history,

1769
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:07,750
to English,
to foreign language,

1770
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:11,100
and you connect those to
art and music and you can,

1771
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:14,800
there's some there cause they're all
those things. If you look at history,

1772
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:17,620
all of those things are connected.
They're all connected,

1773
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,500
but we don't make the connections
and when you don't connect things,

1774
01:52:20,501 --> 01:52:22,180
they're weaker.
So I would,

1775
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:25,750
I would force or I wouldn't mean
you wouldn't have to force it.

1776
01:52:25,751 --> 01:52:27,310
You don't have to force it.
I would,

1777
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:33,990
I would foster that thread through
everything so that everything made sense,

1778
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:40,090
you know, in a big picture. And
that way when you get granular,

1779
01:52:40,120 --> 01:52:45,120
you're tying it into this overlying
theme of civilization and the movement of

1780
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:51,770
the way things go through civilization.
Now I'll tell you another piece of this.

1781
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:58,150
You would learn vocational skills at my
school 100% you would learn carpentry,

1782
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:02,720
you would learn how to do electrical
wiring, you would learn plumbing,

1783
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:06,650
you would learn automotive
and motor repair.

1784
01:53:06,651 --> 01:53:09,920
You would learn all those things and
guess what are you going to take those

1785
01:53:09,921 --> 01:53:11,270
courses? Like I said this, this court,

1786
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:14,930
this school would probably only be a year
long. That's fine because guess what?

1787
01:53:15,740 --> 01:53:19,670
You know how long it takes to learn
basic carpentry. Not Real Long.

1788
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:21,890
Are you gonna be a skilled carpenter?
No,

1789
01:53:21,891 --> 01:53:23,570
but I'm not looking to
build skilled carpenters.

1790
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:28,010
Are you going to be ready
to rewire a giant building?

1791
01:53:28,011 --> 01:53:31,370
A commercial building? No.
But could you rewire a house?

1792
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:36,170
Likely it doesn't take that much time to
learn that. You won't be skilled at it,

1793
01:53:36,171 --> 01:53:40,970
but you will have the knowledge.
Same thing with plumbing and like I said,

1794
01:53:40,971 --> 01:53:41,760
the automotive,
so I,

1795
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,500
so you would learn those vocational
skills because we have people in America

1796
01:53:45,501 --> 01:53:48,860
right now that don't know any of
that stuff. And that's jacked up.

1797
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:53,240
Yeah.
Even like when I was young,

1798
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:57,950
my dad used to make us change our own oil
there. Now you can, you can go anywhere.

1799
01:53:57,951 --> 01:54:00,470
It takes thinking whatever's
50 minutes, but he's like, Nah,

1800
01:54:00,471 --> 01:54:03,410
you change your own oil. You got to
know what to do with the oil. You know,

1801
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:04,700
there's this little process.

1802
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:07,970
You can't just be rolling around and
change flat tire. Even though I have AAA,

1803
01:54:07,971 --> 01:54:08,250
I don't,

1804
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:11,830
I don't culture blade for flat tire
because Seitan hadn't got a flat tire in

1805
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,171
long time.

1806
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:16,420
I got a flat tire one day and actually
recently I've been getting kind of fun

1807
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,450
nonetheless. But I change them every
time because when I first got it,

1808
01:54:20,451 --> 01:54:22,820
after not having a flat tire
for awhile, I thought, Oh man,

1809
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:27,960
do I even remember how to do this? Of
course I did. I remember how to do it.

1810
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:31,880
It's not that hard, just like you said.
So there are people who don't know,

1811
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:34,770
they get a flat tire and they're, they're,
they're lost, they're lost. And they,

1812
01:54:34,771 --> 01:54:37,640
yeah, they don't have, they have AAA
or whatever. Sure. They get saved.

1813
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:40,880
What if they can do with them themselves?
You know?

1814
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:46,040
So at my school you would learn those
vocational skills and then on top of that

1815
01:54:48,040 --> 01:54:50,620
you'd learn basic survival skills,

1816
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:56,470
little hunting or fishing,
little gardening and planting
and how to grow things,

1817
01:54:56,471 --> 01:55:00,730
grow food and your basics,
water, fire and shelter.

1818
01:55:00,731 --> 01:55:05,620
You'd learn those. So you'd be able to
survive in any environment, any situation,

1819
01:55:06,850 --> 01:55:10,120
obviously with all those survival skills.

1820
01:55:10,121 --> 01:55:14,190
And the vocational skills and even
the classroom knowledge skills there

1821
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:17,460
B, a, a

1822
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:23,760
system of team building where you're going
to be doing things together as a team,

1823
01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:29,070
not only for your classes but also
cleaning the place, working together.

1824
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:32,280
And even that's what they do. And in
military boot camps, all you do is clean.

1825
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:36,780
They turned cleaning into like a team
building exercise. So we would do that.

1826
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:39,313
Uh,

1827
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:43,170
people would be in simple uniforms,
you know, nothing too fancy.

1828
01:55:43,440 --> 01:55:48,440
Obviously the nighttime would be the
study of the martial arts and you would

1829
01:55:51,931 --> 01:55:56,310
learn the basics of Jujitsu,
boxing,

1830
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:57,990
Muay Thai and wrestling.

1831
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:01,470
And that's what my school would be like.

1832
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:05,880
And there'd be some real discipline there
and there would be real achievement.

1833
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:10,620
And I think that anybody that spent one
year in that school right there would

1834
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:11,200
have

1835
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:16,200
a infinitely greater chance
of success and domination

1836
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,240
in whatever they feel
they chose to go into.

1837
01:56:20,330 --> 01:56:23,150
And when they went back to their school,
to their regular school,

1838
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,960
you, it's funny at first, at
first thought when you're calm,

1839
01:56:26,961 --> 01:56:28,610
kind of picturing this stuff or whatever.

1840
01:56:29,150 --> 01:56:32,660
And I'm sure I'm not the only one
listening to this where you'd be like,

1841
01:56:32,661 --> 01:56:35,090
oh shoot, that product, that's
a hardcore school, you know,

1842
01:56:35,091 --> 01:56:38,870
they gotta be ready to get and now
you need, now you want to go. Well,

1843
01:56:38,871 --> 01:56:41,930
when you think about it, it probably
wouldn't be that hardcore. In fact,

1844
01:56:41,931 --> 01:56:46,040
it probably be kind of fun given
your approach to, you know,

1845
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:49,580
teaching or in leading and
stuff like that because man,

1846
01:56:49,581 --> 01:56:52,610
I remember when I f it was
like when I first met you,

1847
01:56:52,611 --> 01:56:55,160
I met you and you don't remember
when I first met you, but um,

1848
01:56:55,161 --> 01:56:56,990
so I kind of knew you were whatever it,
a little bit,

1849
01:56:57,230 --> 01:57:01,410
this is back at the boxing club and you
came in as a first time I saw your kids

1850
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:04,820
toward like Thor and I think one of his
sisters, I forget, I don't know which one,

1851
01:57:04,821 --> 01:57:07,940
I forget. Oh, they were just little kids
and you had brought them or whatever.

1852
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:12,420
And they come in the door and
they just start running around.

1853
01:57:12,421 --> 01:57:14,760
Like this is a big playground.
Right, right, right. Yeah.

1854
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:17,060
Hitting the bags and doing all this stuff.
Right.

1855
01:57:17,061 --> 01:57:20,200
And then you had this look on your face,
Kinda like you see,

1856
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:22,370
it's almost like you had
control of the situation,

1857
01:57:22,371 --> 01:57:24,140
but you're just going to let
them be them kind of thing.

1858
01:57:24,350 --> 01:57:27,110
And I remember just kind of
kind of looking at it like,
oh this is interesting.

1859
01:57:27,111 --> 01:57:29,660
I'd never seen Jocko and his
kids, you know, so let me,

1860
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:31,130
so I was kind of just watching.

1861
01:57:31,131 --> 01:57:35,450
So decentralized command in
a manner of speaking. Yeah.

1862
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:40,130
So just to start to kind of
going on and I think you're,

1863
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:43,910
you might even been teaching,
I don't know, you were
involved in some way and um,

1864
01:57:46,010 --> 01:57:50,150
they got loud real quick and it kind
of was like, for lack of a better term,

1865
01:57:50,240 --> 01:57:54,080
kind of distracting and you like kind of
stop what you're doing. You were like,

1866
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:59,120
you could stop that. Like real,
real mean. And then I was like,

1867
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:02,420
let me see like how they react, you
know, I look and then they stop.

1868
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:05,980
They look at you like just, just for
maybe almost two seconds. They look,

1869
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:09,410
he look at each other like that and they
just start laughing and they keep going.

1870
01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:13,610
You kind of started laughing at the
same time. I was like, oh, I see.

1871
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:17,660
Like you're probably strict,
but it's not that they're kids,

1872
01:58:18,080 --> 01:58:21,170
they're doing kid stuff. We want,
they're not breaking nothing. Yeah.

1873
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:24,770
So it was like, it's almost like they
knew and then they knew beyond that,

1874
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:29,170
you know, like they knew what was
ultimately up. That was interesting. Well,

1875
01:58:29,530 --> 01:58:32,090
who knows, maybe we can put this
school together at some point.

1876
01:58:32,450 --> 01:58:36,650
I know there's a lot of people that
would love to send their kids to a school

1877
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:38,500
like this on every,

1878
01:58:38,560 --> 01:58:42,070
and I would obviously I
send all my kids to school

1879
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:46,690
like this tomorrow if it existed.
Yeah. One Year of the academy.

1880
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:50,870
That's what it's called, the academy.
I think it would have to be. Yep.

1881
01:58:52,240 --> 01:58:53,290
A big part of it.
Yeah.

1882
01:58:54,090 --> 01:58:56,190
And I'm sure this would pro,
and I'm sure there's would be,

1883
01:58:56,250 --> 01:59:01,250
would be implemented in the whole system
is how the teachers and instructors are

1884
01:59:03,091 --> 01:59:05,610
treated. For sure. You know like,

1885
01:59:05,670 --> 01:59:10,260
because I think that's a lot of the time
anyway. Like one of the many issues,

1886
01:59:10,290 --> 01:59:12,510
you know when they,
when issues come up in education,

1887
01:59:12,720 --> 01:59:17,010
it's like how are the teachers
regarded? Yeah. That situation.

1888
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:22,200
Yeah man. Yeah. Good. Sign me
up. Okay. Okay. Next question.

1889
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:27,570
I'm about to accept a position across
the country after changing the IT field I

1890
01:59:27,571 --> 01:59:28,404
work in,

1891
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,880
I've just been accepted from my first
job and in this type of position with the

1892
01:59:32,881 --> 01:59:35,070
amount of responsibility
I'll have and I'm not,

1893
01:59:35,370 --> 01:59:39,330
or I'm having some issues and some heavy
hesitations on if I'll be good enough.

1894
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:43,080
Have you ever been in a position before
where you tried to bite off more than

1895
01:59:43,081 --> 01:59:44,460
you can chew professionally?

1896
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:49,710
How do you approach it and is there ever
a time where you think it's best to bow

1897
01:59:49,711 --> 01:59:53,730
out and quit? And if so, how
do you know when that point is?

1898
01:59:55,560 --> 01:59:56,393
So,
uh,

1899
01:59:56,520 --> 02:00:00,720
actually most people get hired into
leadership positions they haven't been in

1900
02:00:00,721 --> 02:00:04,050
before. The seal teams is all
about that. You get promoted,

1901
02:00:04,051 --> 02:00:07,320
you do that leadership job in just
as you're getting the hang of it,

1902
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,150
you get promoted again.

1903
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:15,380
So there's nothing abnormal about
feeling that you aren't quite ready for a

1904
02:00:15,421 --> 02:00:16,254
leadership position.

1905
02:00:16,830 --> 02:00:21,830
And the reason that some people fail
when they get to these positions that

1906
02:00:22,771 --> 02:00:26,460
they're not ready for is because they're
nervous that they're going to show that.

1907
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:31,740
And so they tried to hide it.
They're afraid to ask questions,

1908
02:00:31,741 --> 02:00:33,450
they're afraid to say they don't know.

1909
02:00:33,451 --> 02:00:37,920
So they end up looking scared and stupid.

1910
02:00:38,270 --> 02:00:43,080
Hmm.
Which equates to looking in competent.

1911
02:00:44,520 --> 02:00:48,300
And I mean even just with the beloved
captain, Neat, they actually kicked off.

1912
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:52,680
There's a reason this guy included
those statements in there that he asked

1913
02:00:52,681 --> 02:00:56,220
questions and asked for guidance
and admitted his mistakes.

1914
02:00:56,221 --> 02:01:00,270
There's a reason that he was beloved.
That is one of the reasons.

1915
02:01:02,250 --> 02:01:02,860
Okay.

1916
02:01:02,860 --> 02:01:05,740
And so, so,

1917
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:10,830
so that's what you gotta
do is be okay with it.

1918
02:01:10,991 --> 02:01:14,590
Don't try and hide it now to bow
out and quit. I have not done that,

1919
02:01:15,610 --> 02:01:20,260
but there's no reason to because if
I don't know how to do something,

1920
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:24,130
I have no problem asking for help.
Up and down the chain of command,

1921
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:27,760
up and down the chain of command.
Nothing wrong with that.

1922
02:01:29,650 --> 02:01:33,100
And I've said this before,
that what, what you're feeling.

1923
02:01:34,460 --> 02:01:34,970
Okay.

1924
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:36,800
Um,
person that asked this question,

1925
02:01:36,980 --> 02:01:39,980
what you're feeling that you weren't
good enough and that you don't want

1926
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:44,540
to blow it. Those are actually
signs of humility and it's okay.

1927
02:01:44,541 --> 02:01:45,290
Those are good.

1928
02:01:45,290 --> 02:01:50,290
I've felt those feelings my whole career
and I still feel I'm now and when I was

1929
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:55,250
in the seal teams I would over prepare
for things and it wasn't because I

1930
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:57,650
thought I was going to dominate it was
cause I thought I was going to fall short

1931
02:01:59,140 --> 02:02:01,520
it even I was telling you

1932
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:06,640
I prepared for the podcast all yesterday.
I thought I was good.

1933
02:02:06,641 --> 02:02:09,760
Literally had printed out my notes,
woke up this morning,

1934
02:02:09,761 --> 02:02:13,930
worked out and I was like, no, I'm not
ready. I over prepare for this. Why?

1935
02:02:13,931 --> 02:02:18,931
Because in my mind I'm feeling that I'm
going to blow it and I don't like that.

1936
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:25,220
The thing, it's like a for real
thing, it's called imposter syndrome.

1937
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:28,900
You've heard of that? No, it's this
and I think, you know what? I think,

1938
02:02:28,901 --> 02:02:32,650
I think everyone has it in whether
it's a teeny tiny bit or a lot.

1939
02:02:33,220 --> 02:02:35,410
It's where it's basically you feel this,

1940
02:02:35,411 --> 02:02:39,490
you feel like I'm really like on the
inside, like I'm really not this good.

1941
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,760
You can be like champion of the world
and on the inside you're like this just a

1942
02:02:42,761 --> 02:02:45,190
matter of time before they find
me out. You know, I, I don't know.

1943
02:02:45,191 --> 02:02:46,330
I don't deserve to be here.

1944
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:50,590
Whatever that I wish more people would
have that because there's a lot of people

1945
02:02:50,591 --> 02:02:54,100
that I know that have been in leadership
positions that feel that they have the

1946
02:02:54,101 --> 02:02:58,510
divine right to be there.
A lot of times they'll have it,

1947
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:01,140
they'll behave in that.
Oh they absolutely you're saying you do.

1948
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:03,460
That's why they fail.
That's crazy.

1949
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:08,500
So rehash as always,
bottom line,

1950
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:09,363
be humble.

1951
02:03:09,880 --> 02:03:14,880
Study and learn what you can ask
questions and if you don't know something,

1952
02:03:15,731 --> 02:03:18,010
admit it.
Now I had to make this note,

1953
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:23,470
and I'm cautious to even say this,
but I do have to say it.

1954
02:03:25,060 --> 02:03:30,060
Asking questions doesn't just mean putting
your ignorance on clear display all

1955
02:03:31,631 --> 02:03:36,460
the time. Okay. When you ask questions,

1956
02:03:36,490 --> 02:03:39,940
make sure you are asking thoughtful,

1957
02:03:40,090 --> 02:03:43,690
meaningful questions.
In fact,

1958
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:47,350
if you can find out the
answer on your own, do that.

1959
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:50,080
If it's something that you can refer back
to and you can look up and you can go

1960
02:03:50,081 --> 02:03:51,340
back and you can check out the org chart,

1961
02:03:51,341 --> 02:03:54,430
you can see where that department is
or you can find out who's running that

1962
02:03:54,431 --> 02:03:57,820
project without having to
ask that question. Do that.

1963
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:03,020
Because
contrary to popular belief,

1964
02:04:03,021 --> 02:04:08,021
there actually is in fact such a thing
as a stupid question and you can get away

1965
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:10,970
with it sometimes. So you don't
need to be hyper paranoid about it,

1966
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:13,910
but you also,

1967
02:04:13,911 --> 02:04:18,910
part of leadership is confidence and uh,

1968
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:19,963
up and down.

1969
02:04:20,150 --> 02:04:23,300
So you got to have some confidence and
you people have to have some confidence

1970
02:04:23,301 --> 02:04:26,300
in you. And if, if you don't know anything

1971
02:04:27,890 --> 02:04:29,840
and you can't figure it out for,

1972
02:04:29,841 --> 02:04:33,500
you can't figure out some
portions of that on your own.

1973
02:04:34,400 --> 02:04:38,010
That's not a good sign because I just
expect you're gonna be in charge of me.

1974
02:04:38,070 --> 02:04:40,200
Well that you can look that up.
You didn't,

1975
02:04:40,201 --> 02:04:43,290
you didn't review this before you came
in here. I know you don't know my job,

1976
02:04:43,291 --> 02:04:46,710
but you should at least know what
the requirements of my job are. You,

1977
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:51,570
she didn't at least know what the outcomes
at a strategic level of my job are.

1978
02:04:51,571 --> 02:04:53,310
Right? You see what I'm
saying? There's a difference.

1979
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:57,360
So you don't have to go in there and be,
um,

1980
02:04:58,830 --> 02:05:00,090
overly humble.

1981
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:05,250
You don't have to go in there
and be overtly blank, uh, uh,

1982
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:09,000
wide open with what you,
with what you don't know.

1983
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:14,600
Because again, I was cautious to make
this note because this doesn't, I w I,

1984
02:05:14,700 --> 02:05:17,550
you should feel comfortable enough
saying, hey, I don't know how to do this.

1985
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:19,590
Or Hey, can you explain that
the way that works to me?

1986
02:05:19,740 --> 02:05:22,530
Can you explain what this project,
you know, what this project entails.

1987
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,440
There's nothing wrong with that.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1988
02:05:25,680 --> 02:05:30,680
But if you go into a room
and you accidentally ask a
question of something that

1989
02:05:33,030 --> 02:05:37,930
everybody legitimately should know,
you're going to look stupid. Right?

1990
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:42,750
That's a mistake. That's a
mistake. And so don't do that.

1991
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:45,660
It's okay. Be Humble, ask questions.

1992
02:05:45,850 --> 02:05:48,060
But ask thoughtful questions,

1993
02:05:48,150 --> 02:05:52,770
meaningful questions that you
don't know because it's brewed,

1994
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:56,430
it would be pretty difficult for you
to know the answer yet. It's the,

1995
02:05:56,431 --> 02:05:59,560
I mean it kind of seems obvious when you
say it out loud where you're not going

1996
02:05:59,561 --> 02:06:01,980
to know everything. No,
so that makes sense.

1997
02:06:02,010 --> 02:06:06,210
But you've got to know something's
gotta be there for a reason.

1998
02:06:06,211 --> 02:06:09,090
You can't be like, hey, I don't know
nothing. I shouldn't be hearing it.

1999
02:06:09,091 --> 02:06:12,270
And that's another thing from the beloved
captain or he says for a few days he

2000
02:06:12,271 --> 02:06:16,620
didn't do anything. Guess what?
If you can observe for a few days,

2001
02:06:16,621 --> 02:06:20,040
you're probably going to answer a bunch
of questions just for observation and

2002
02:06:20,041 --> 02:06:25,041
taking notes and getting back and maybe
conferring with your trusted agent or

2003
02:06:25,471 --> 02:06:29,970
you're a senior enlisted guy or you're,
you're a superintendent.

2004
02:06:29,971 --> 02:06:32,790
You can confer directly
with them and keep that,

2005
02:06:32,791 --> 02:06:36,930
build that relationship while
you're guard garnering information.

2006
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:44,900
Yeah, don't be that guy trying
not to. It's true. Try not to

2007
02:06:46,830 --> 02:06:47,663
Jocko,

2008
02:06:48,160 --> 02:06:53,160
how do I take ownership of mixed messages
to the people under me from the other

2009
02:06:53,791 --> 02:06:57,780
leaders in my group? Pretty
straightforward question. I like it.

2010
02:06:58,320 --> 02:06:59,280
Well first of all,

2011
02:06:59,310 --> 02:07:02,850
you have to address this straight up
with the other leaders in your group

2012
02:07:02,851 --> 02:07:05,460
because if you aren't
aligned as a leadership team,

2013
02:07:06,630 --> 02:07:09,750
this is going to hurt the cause.
It is absolutely going to hurt the cross.

2014
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:12,030
This is critical and
it's going to be hard.

2015
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:17,040
And there are some things in your group
that people do not agree on and that is

2016
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:21,360
why they are undermining the messaging
or why they're giving out different

2017
02:07:21,361 --> 02:07:23,130
messaging because they
don't agree with it.

2018
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:26,010
They don't have the courage
to stand up and say, Hey,

2019
02:07:26,011 --> 02:07:28,080
I don't agree with this right here,
so let's do it a different way.

2020
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:30,570
Here's my thoughts. They don't have the
courage to that. So what do they do?

2021
02:07:30,870 --> 02:07:33,180
They just sit back and then when
it comes time to put out the word,

2022
02:07:33,181 --> 02:07:35,440
they put up the mixed messages and it's,

2023
02:07:35,470 --> 02:07:38,680
it's a bad situation and you
actually have to lead here.

2024
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:40,440
That's what you have to do.
Any,

2025
02:07:40,441 --> 02:07:45,441
it shouldn't actually be that hard because
what you're asking for is something

2026
02:07:46,271 --> 02:07:48,960
that anybody can tell is
important. So, you know, you said,

2027
02:07:49,050 --> 02:07:51,580
do you say to your leadership
team, you go, hey guys,

2028
02:07:52,090 --> 02:07:55,900
our message to the troops needs to
be aligned. And right now it isn't.

2029
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,070
We need to fix that.

2030
02:07:57,220 --> 02:07:59,980
Is there anyone on your leadership
team's going to disagree with that? No,

2031
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:02,440
they won't. That's not what
they disagree with. They,

2032
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:05,980
everybody knows that the leadership
team has to have an aligned message.

2033
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:08,260
They have to be on the
same sheet of music.

2034
02:08:09,130 --> 02:08:13,450
And that's what you need
to do. And, and again,

2035
02:08:13,451 --> 02:08:14,800
it's going to be a hard conversation.

2036
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:20,290
It's going to bring out that statement
should bring out the conversation of what

2037
02:08:20,291 --> 02:08:23,860
people don't agree on and why
they're sending ms messages. Now,

2038
02:08:25,660 --> 02:08:30,430
if you,
if you cannot get them aligned,

2039
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:33,340
it is a serious problem.
But if you can't,

2040
02:08:33,341 --> 02:08:36,520
the best thing you can do is mitigate,

2041
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:43,650
mitigate that to your team by
becoming the trusted voice.

2042
02:08:44,250 --> 02:08:46,990
So, so with your team, you want
to become the trusted voice.

2043
02:08:46,991 --> 02:08:49,960
Now you did this doesn't mean they're
going to go on undermine your other

2044
02:08:49,961 --> 02:08:53,440
leaders. It's a, I'll echo came in here.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.

2045
02:08:53,441 --> 02:08:55,030
No, no, no, no, no, no. That's
not what I'm talking about.

2046
02:08:55,031 --> 02:09:00,031
I'm never almost never talking about
undermining another leader or a leadership

2047
02:09:01,301 --> 02:09:04,630
team. What I'm going to do though is
I'm going to translate them and say,

2048
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:10,180
hey guys, our job on this, I Know Echo
said that. Here's our job. Here's,

2049
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:14,560
here's what our focus needs to be.
Here's the way this translates for us,

2050
02:09:14,650 --> 02:09:18,550
so I'm not disparaging you and
I'm not even disagreeing with you.

2051
02:09:18,580 --> 02:09:21,550
I'm simply honing the message for my team.

2052
02:09:23,080 --> 02:09:27,340
Now you still, even when you do that,

2053
02:09:27,341 --> 02:09:29,200
you're mitigating that
as much as possible.

2054
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:34,230
You still have to maintain the critical
goal of getting your leadership team

2055
02:09:34,631 --> 02:09:39,631
aligned and one other little tool to
help make that happen is to present their

2056
02:09:41,531 --> 02:09:45,030
words back to them and you said,
you know what?

2057
02:09:45,031 --> 02:09:48,070
I wrote down what you said to the team
this morning and I just wanted to go

2058
02:09:48,071 --> 02:09:52,330
through that with you and break it down
a little bit and and then go through it

2059
02:09:52,360 --> 02:09:57,360
line by line and have the
hard conversations and
make the tough decisions.

2060
02:09:58,830 --> 02:10:00,610
You've got to make the tough decisions

2061
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:07,530
and also give a little seed some points,

2062
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:11,980
right?
Be Flexible but unify,

2063
02:10:12,490 --> 02:10:16,600
unify the message. And there's a
worse, not even a worst case scenario,

2064
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:20,740
but there are scenarios where echo and
I cannot agree on the message and we got

2065
02:10:20,741 --> 02:10:24,160
to go up the chain of command.
Now, I would never want to do that.

2066
02:10:24,250 --> 02:10:27,370
I would never ever want to say to my boss,
Hey,

2067
02:10:27,460 --> 02:10:31,450
echo and I can agree you need to
make the decision for us. To me,

2068
02:10:31,451 --> 02:10:32,350
that's a total failure.

2069
02:10:32,530 --> 02:10:36,530
It's a failure in my leadership that I
can't get us on the same sheet of music.

2070
02:10:37,100 --> 02:10:41,240
So I don't, I can't even think
of any time that I ever did that.

2071
02:10:41,241 --> 02:10:43,900
Went to my boss and said, hey
boss, I can't we, you know,

2072
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:47,590
I can't come to come to a conclusion here
with the other task in new commanders

2073
02:10:47,591 --> 02:10:50,660
or I can't come to a conclusion with
the other platoon commanders or I can't

2074
02:10:50,661 --> 02:10:54,170
come come to conclusion with the my
squad about how we should do this.

2075
02:10:54,171 --> 02:10:58,070
I've never done that. So you should be
able to, if you're right, you'll win.

2076
02:10:58,071 --> 02:11:00,380
The argument and if you're
wrong then you change your mind.

2077
02:11:00,380 --> 02:11:03,470
So it's not that it's not like this
ultimate, not like I'm saying I'm great.

2078
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:05,480
I'm just saying if you're right,

2079
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:09,920
then you'll win the argument and if
you're wrong then you'll change your mind.

2080
02:11:09,980 --> 02:11:12,380
So it's not that hard.
So that's what happens.

2081
02:11:12,381 --> 02:11:14,480
Needs to happen here
with the leadership team.

2082
02:11:14,850 --> 02:11:19,850
We've got to find out who's right and
people that are right need to convince the

2083
02:11:20,751 --> 02:11:25,370
people that are wrong. Now
you need to check your ego.
Obviously across the board,

2084
02:11:25,490 --> 02:11:29,030
every t everybody on the team's got to
check the Ricoh cause a lot of people

2085
02:11:29,031 --> 02:11:33,350
will be holding onto their idea because
it's their idea and they loved their idea

2086
02:11:35,020 --> 02:11:36,800
because there's egotistical

2087
02:11:39,870 --> 02:11:44,760
and that's how I would deal with mixed
messages coming down the chain of

2088
02:11:44,761 --> 02:11:47,430
command.
I'm going to go ahead and just say it.

2089
02:11:47,550 --> 02:11:51,570
That could have been one of the best
lines I've ever heard. If you're right,

2090
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:56,340
you win the argument. If you're wrong,
you'll change your mind. That's a good,

2091
02:11:56,400 --> 02:12:00,900
that's a good word. You just make that
up. I didn't just make it up. I mean,

2092
02:12:00,901 --> 02:12:04,730
I guess it's something that
I've known but right. Yeah.

2093
02:12:04,830 --> 02:12:07,290
That's what makes it so good. Cause
you kind of, it kind of seems like,

2094
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:09,810
Oh yeah you don't. Right.
But that's never the case.

2095
02:12:10,530 --> 02:12:12,990
But if you're being on the up and up,
there it is right there.

2096
02:12:13,710 --> 02:12:14,543
Yeah.

2097
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:21,040
There you go. Echo likes that one.
No, we've got time for about one more.

2098
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:24,940
I don't see why not.
Jocko,

2099
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:30,160
you often talk about being on the path.

2100
02:12:30,790 --> 02:12:33,250
What path is that and where does it lead?

2101
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:37,040
Ah,
yes,

2102
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:39,560
the path.

2103
02:12:41,850 --> 02:12:46,850
Well I can tell you what path I'm on
and what path I strive to stay on.

2104
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:52,900
And that is the war path.

2105
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:58,220
That's the path I'm on
the war path.

2106
02:12:58,520 --> 02:13:00,620
A path of war.

2107
02:13:03,570 --> 02:13:08,460
Cause to me warpath means
moving toward a battle,

2108
02:13:09,120 --> 02:13:11,050
a fight towards [inaudible].

2109
02:13:11,690 --> 02:13:12,523
Yeah.

2110
02:13:14,410 --> 02:13:17,890
In that is what I am doing.

2111
02:13:17,891 --> 02:13:19,600
And that's what I've always been doing.

2112
02:13:21,190 --> 02:13:26,190
Whether it was the actual war
against our nation's enemies

2113
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:29,270
or the war

2114
02:13:31,050 --> 02:13:35,820
against my own weaknesses.
That is what I am doing.

2115
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,620
Preparing
and,

2116
02:13:40,870 --> 02:13:45,870
and sharpening my sword and honing my
skills and maintaining the unmitigated

2117
02:13:48,531 --> 02:13:52,940
daily discipline in all things.

2118
02:13:55,930 --> 02:13:59,740
And the war path is just that.
It's a path.

2119
02:14:00,850 --> 02:14:03,280
It's a root.
It leads somewhere.

2120
02:14:05,980 --> 02:14:09,640
And so you ask, okay,
then where does it lead?

2121
02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:15,090
And yes, yes, it,

2122
02:14:15,110 --> 02:14:19,180
it can lead to war.
And that's fine.

2123
02:14:20,740 --> 02:14:23,890
In fact,
I am waiting

2124
02:14:25,850 --> 02:14:26,980
and I am ready

2125
02:14:30,170 --> 02:14:35,170
because the war path is
a war against weakness.

2126
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:38,150
And so it leads to strength.

2127
02:14:39,550 --> 02:14:42,620
It's a war against ignorance.

2128
02:14:44,260 --> 02:14:45,850
And so it leads to knowledge

2129
02:14:47,850 --> 02:14:50,380
eats a war against confusion.

2130
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:56,660
And so it delivers
understanding

2131
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,690
and the path,

2132
02:15:02,470 --> 02:15:04,960
the war path leads to

2133
02:15:06,660 --> 02:15:11,660
control and leads to
ownership of your life.

2134
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:18,380
And that to me is the war path,

2135
02:15:18,500 --> 02:15:21,740
the path of fire and adversity,

2136
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:25,820
the path of blood and
sweat and of suffering.

2137
02:15:28,650 --> 02:15:32,610
The warpath is the preeminent
path of discipline,

2138
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:39,700
which is why
it leads to freedom.

2139
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:43,760
And beyond that,

2140
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:50,530
in the end,
the war path,

2141
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:55,330
it leads
to peace.

2142
02:15:58,730 --> 02:16:03,290
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2143
02:16:04,550 --> 02:16:09,550
So thanks to everyone out there for
taking the time to listen to this,

2144
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:14,330
this,
this little podcast we put together.

2145
02:16:15,260 --> 02:16:18,290
And if you like it,
then you want to support it.

2146
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:23,360
Echo. Nah, do they do that?
If you're in the mood,

2147
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:27,770
if you worked out,

2148
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:31,030
I know you heard this before,

2149
02:16:31,031 --> 02:16:34,030
but if you work out and you want
supplements that actually work because the

2150
02:16:34,031 --> 02:16:36,880
supplement industry,
and you probably know this bro,

2151
02:16:36,881 --> 02:16:41,590
they can put whatever they want and
there's no regulation. Yeah, you can,

2152
02:16:42,220 --> 02:16:43,440
I don't know if it was a documentary.

2153
02:16:43,490 --> 02:16:46,420
It's something like that where a guy
just put chalk, that's all it was.

2154
02:16:46,421 --> 02:16:49,990
Chalk and there he was like, hey
look, protein powder, sell it.

2155
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:51,910
And either he found there was like,

2156
02:16:51,911 --> 02:16:56,911
there was no like regulation saying
he couldn't do it technically anyway.

2157
02:16:57,270 --> 02:16:59,290
Um, it's, it's a whole
long thing nonetheless.

2158
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:02,380
If you want for real ones where
it's actually not a bad product id,

2159
02:17:02,381 --> 02:17:06,070
we could make protein powder that
you can use as chocolate bar.

2160
02:17:06,940 --> 02:17:11,800
So you could be chalking up and then
eating. Yeah. Good. No. Yeah, yeah.

2161
02:17:12,050 --> 02:17:15,970
I Dunno. Maybe you get on it to
make the protein powder chalkup

2162
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:20,680
yeah, that's, that's a little bit
different from what else kind of sane.

2163
02:17:20,770 --> 02:17:22,360
But nonetheless,

2164
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:26,390
if you go to [inaudible] dot com
slash Jocko you can get 10% off their

2165
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:27,311
supplements.
Anyway.

2166
02:17:27,311 --> 02:17:31,120
My point being with that story is that
their supplements are all like legit.

2167
02:17:31,150 --> 02:17:34,330
And you can even read about
it like the [inaudible] oil.

2168
02:17:35,500 --> 02:17:37,120
I said this before,
I feel like I said this before,

2169
02:17:37,121 --> 02:17:41,980
but you can see like how they harvest
them. They use like eco friendly boats.

2170
02:17:41,981 --> 02:17:45,110
Like it's like, it's basically
the ones who went to go votes.

2171
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:49,480
Like the engines are like ecofriendly and
like, you know, like that kind of stuff.

2172
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:52,380
Anyway, I was watching it. You can
get addicted on there. But um, yeah,

2173
02:17:52,390 --> 02:17:57,310
all legit warrior bars. I feel like we
haven't really talked about worrying.

2174
02:17:57,940 --> 02:18:00,670
I got asked by somebody on Twitter
the other day what, you know, hey,

2175
02:18:00,671 --> 02:18:03,670
my joints are hurting, which I take,
take her awhile. Yeah, that's it man.

2176
02:18:03,671 --> 02:18:06,640
Take her while. Yeah. I've been using
[inaudible] for a really long time.

2177
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:11,500
I'm 44 years old.
I'm almost 45 years old actually.

2178
02:18:11,800 --> 02:18:16,720
And my joints are doing
solid and knock on wood. Um,

2179
02:18:17,170 --> 02:18:17,590
you know,

2180
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:22,590
I had some joint pain in the past
and when I started taking Krill oil,

2181
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:27,760
I'm talking 10, maybe
even longer years ago. Um,

2182
02:18:28,060 --> 02:18:29,540
the,
it's I,

2183
02:18:29,541 --> 02:18:34,080
I definitely attributed to helping
me and also also the glucosamine.

2184
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:38,800
Yeah. So, and that's saying
a lot because you're big.

2185
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:43,390
You're a big guy to third
if I'm not exactly flexible.

2186
02:18:43,860 --> 02:18:45,430
Yeah.
Flexible person.

2187
02:18:45,850 --> 02:18:49,040
And I do like,

2188
02:18:49,670 --> 02:18:53,390
I do heavy duty stuff. I
mean I'll get after it. Not,

2189
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:57,000
not as much as I want to and not
as much as I should, but I tried,

2190
02:18:57,250 --> 02:19:01,660
I tried to, to work out
hard. I train Jujitsu,

2191
02:19:01,750 --> 02:19:05,140
I surf, I run, I sprint,

2192
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:07,360
I just do all kinds of activities.

2193
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:11,710
And before up until several years ago,

2194
02:19:11,711 --> 02:19:13,510
I was in the military,

2195
02:19:13,511 --> 02:19:17,950
I was in the seal teams and I was
running around doing all that crap for my

2196
02:19:17,951 --> 02:19:20,440
whole life.
And so yeah,

2197
02:19:20,470 --> 02:19:24,340
I would say order up some krill oil bro.
Just saying,

2198
02:19:24,400 --> 02:19:27,980
just doing Jujitsu alone, especially
as much as you do it, that alone,

2199
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:31,550
old young, whatever, just
doing the end. You're like,

2200
02:19:31,551 --> 02:19:36,020
my joints are fine if you're in that
situation to buy that alone. Yeah. And,

2201
02:19:36,021 --> 02:19:37,550
and the Krill oil for sure.

2202
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:41,300
And also I believe that
working out period is,

2203
02:19:41,310 --> 02:19:46,310
is very helpful in staying injury free
because I always work out and therefore

2204
02:19:46,731 --> 02:19:50,870
I'm always moving and therefore
my joints aren't getting rusty,

2205
02:19:51,410 --> 02:19:56,180
you know? Do both, do both.
You know, I do get injured,

2206
02:19:56,210 --> 02:19:59,930
you know, I had the finger injury, which
is a better net. Pretty good right now.

2207
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:04,490
I had, um, I had my shoulder
got tweaked a little bit.

2208
02:20:05,060 --> 02:20:07,880
Yeah. But that's a situation that's
nice. Got me from rolling. Yeah.

2209
02:20:07,881 --> 02:20:10,820
And that's not the kind of, Hey, I should
have took more krill oil. It's not that,

2210
02:20:11,020 --> 02:20:13,880
it's like, it's like when you wake up
or when you, when you're like, Hey,

2211
02:20:13,881 --> 02:20:15,920
I'm going to go out. You start
working. You're like, Oh Dang,

2212
02:20:15,921 --> 02:20:19,220
I got to warm up some more. Some Marshall,
you know, and I take it, just Fyi,

2213
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:23,900
I take three of the 500 milligram,

2214
02:20:24,940 --> 02:20:27,680
what are the capsules in the
morning and three at night?

2215
02:20:28,070 --> 02:20:32,630
That's a lot of thousand a day
yet. Dang. Well, hey, there
you go. Then do that then.

2216
02:20:32,870 --> 02:20:37,130
I mean, like I said, you're a big
tank that needs more pills anyway.

2217
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:41,900
Yeah, it's good and firm on it. You know,
you're getting like the good, the good on.

2218
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:44,780
Yeah. You know, it's not
kidding. The clean stuff,

2219
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:50,180
mass manufactured, you know the
one from the corner store. Krill.

2220
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:52,670
Yeah man, it's good. And you get 10% off,

2221
02:20:53,060 --> 02:20:57,880
which is honored grid on a
flash Jocko podcasts probably.

2222
02:20:57,881 --> 02:21:01,820
It's a, it's a win. Win, win.
Yeah. And speaking to port
it, supporting this podcast,

2223
02:21:02,210 --> 02:21:06,380
amazon.com click through,
it might be the best way.

2224
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:11,480
I don't know if it's the best way I would
say it. It's another way. No other way,

2225
02:21:11,720 --> 02:21:13,100
which is very effective,

2226
02:21:13,500 --> 02:21:18,470
which has definitely
helped support the podcast.

2227
02:21:18,740 --> 02:21:22,910
Yeah. And it doesn't cost anything.
It's real easy to do. You just click.

2228
02:21:23,630 --> 02:21:26,690
Yeah, no, yeah, that's good. Yeah. The
key thing to that one is remembering it,

2229
02:21:27,080 --> 02:21:30,320
remembering to do it true too. And he's
like, yeah, trooper tool, we got that.

2230
02:21:30,321 --> 02:21:33,320
So go on the chrome extension.
Interpretable chrome extension.

2231
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:35,370
If you haven't put that
on your browser and,

2232
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:37,970
and you do want to support the
podcast through the Amazon situation,

2233
02:21:38,300 --> 02:21:43,190
put that on there. It's easy. It makes
it super easy, efficient, aggressive,

2234
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:47,630
active and efficient,
not passing like your attitude.

2235
02:21:48,310 --> 02:21:50,100
You can support that way. And then, um,

2236
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:53,210
obviously the po it subscribe
on Itunes and the Youtube,

2237
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:56,570

videos on there starting to,

2238
02:21:56,680 --> 02:21:57,550
and it's going to pick up too.

2239
02:21:57,700 --> 02:22:01,880
I got some more content I'm going
to put up for sure. And then, um,

2240
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:06,430
the Jocko store if you like shirts
and whatnot, if you like them,

2241

get one of those and we
have women's coming out.

2242
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:16,310
Is there anything else
you have coming out? Yeah,

2243
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:21,210
it's a secret. Yeah. Okay.

2244
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:26,340
Actually if you're signed up for the,
if you enlisted in the,

2245
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:31,140
what is it that the insider check email
and find out what else is out there,

2246
02:22:31,340 --> 02:22:33,970
what else is coming, what
else is on the horizon? Yeah.

2247
02:22:34,830 --> 02:22:38,160
Cause we've had a lot of
people ask for this item. What?

2248
02:22:39,440 --> 02:22:41,370
Give me a hint.
Rash guards

2249
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:47,030
[inaudible] rash guards are coming up,
don't do Jujitsu.

2250
02:22:47,070 --> 02:22:50,970
And they still wear rash guards for
like working out, working out or um,

2251
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:56,190
or diving or, or Surf Surfing or
surfing originally for, yeah. Yeah.

2252
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:59,670
I use the surfing rash guard a lot
of times for Jujitsu. But yeah,

2253
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:02,330
the record's coming out and then if you,
if you're into the Geek,

2254
02:23:03,610 --> 02:23:08,190
you got some patches to, Oh,
you got the patches coming
out too. They're good, cool.

2255
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:12,690
Basic the way we like them. But yeah.
Anyway, Jaclyn [inaudible] dot com that's,

2256
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,190
you can see all this stuff
and um, yeah, if he, if,

2257
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,390
if you want to be on the insider's list,
we don't,

2258
02:23:17,391 --> 02:23:22,391
I don't spam people were saying you
like stuff just for the sake of sending

2259
02:23:22,981 --> 02:23:27,660
stuff. I don't do that. In fact,
I kind of understand stuff. Yeah.

2260
02:23:28,020 --> 02:23:30,900
People don't want to be bothered if,
if you're going to send something,

2261
02:23:30,990 --> 02:23:32,730
make it be important.
Yeah.

2262
02:23:32,850 --> 02:23:36,490
At least something that I honestly think
that you'd be interested in. Yes. Yeah.

2263
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:40,840
Honestly, I'm a put some
thought into that. So yeah,
there it is. That's the waste.

2264
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:44,430
Now in the very,
very near future,

2265
02:23:45,480 --> 02:23:50,480
like I'm talking maybe a week
and it's by early September,

2266
02:23:51,420 --> 02:23:54,630
2016,
you will be able to order Jocko white tea

2267
02:23:56,430 --> 02:24:00,420
and you'd be able to order it from Amazon,
which is good to go.

2268
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:03,540
And I got my first
batch in matter of fact,

2269
02:24:03,541 --> 02:24:08,360
I'm drinking a little bit of
that stuff. Right. And um,

2270
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:12,840
it's, it definitely puts
you in the zone low place.

2271
02:24:12,841 --> 02:24:17,760
I like to call the assault zone. It gets,
gets you there. So look for it. This is,

2272
02:24:17,761 --> 02:24:19,050
this is,
you know,

2273
02:24:19,051 --> 02:24:21,390
if you heard that first podcast
with Tim Ferriss and he was like,

2274
02:24:21,391 --> 02:24:24,270
what is this adrenaline filled drink?

2275
02:24:24,300 --> 02:24:27,780
It was white tea and white tea
is not loaded with caffeine.

2276
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:30,960
There's other stuff in there,
there's magic in there,

2277
02:24:30,961 --> 02:24:35,850
there's antioxidants in
there. It tastes good. And uh,

2278
02:24:36,300 --> 02:24:40,170
anyways, so that's common. You'd be
able to order it. We're kind of wonder,

2279
02:24:40,171 --> 02:24:44,340
I'm kind of wondering to see if people
want Jocko white tea. I think they do.

2280
02:24:44,750 --> 02:24:49,450
Yeah. And we will find out
shortly. I know I do. Yeah, it's,

2281
02:24:49,560 --> 02:24:53,370
that's an interesting
thing because you know,

2282
02:24:53,371 --> 02:24:56,850
like just kind of on the surface won't
be like, hey fuck what's Jocko into?

2283
02:24:57,780 --> 02:25:00,510
It's not like,
you know something crazy.

2284
02:25:00,511 --> 02:25:03,390
It's like something let's face
it sounds kind of delicate,

2285
02:25:03,420 --> 02:25:07,890
you know white well when you see the
can that it comes in, it's not delicate.

2286
02:25:07,891 --> 02:25:08,724
It's delicate.

2287
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,730
It's weird cause I was trying to think
of where I discovered it and I actually

2288
02:25:11,731 --> 02:25:16,260
don't know. I actually can't remember
how, why drink it for the first time,

2289
02:25:16,740 --> 02:25:20,570
but when I started drinking I
was like, oh yeah, this stuff,

2290
02:25:20,810 --> 02:25:21,870
it feels good.

2291
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:26,620
Especially when under stress or
there's a lack of sleep or um,

2292
02:25:26,650 --> 02:25:29,740
you need to be mentally sharp.
It's the deal.

2293
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:34,030
But you can mix white tea with,
it'll mess up the taste.

2294
02:25:34,210 --> 02:25:38,980
But you mix Jocko white tea
with Alpha brain. I've done it.

2295
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:43,570
I've done it. I've done it
here in the podcast. Yeah.
It doesn't mess up the taste.

2296
02:25:43,571 --> 02:25:47,920
It tastes good. Dang. All right.
We'll get the white tea. Is,

2297
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:52,480
is a, it's not like this super
harsh taste. It's a supermarket.

2298
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:55,270
It's a mild cause you can taste it.

2299
02:25:55,271 --> 02:26:00,060
You can kind of feel it to
length but heavy, he'd say,

2300
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:02,810
I don't even know how to describe it.
It's just not an act.

2301
02:26:02,850 --> 02:26:07,280
It's not a heavy taste. Yeah, so you
can mix it with lot of stuff. Um,

2302
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,820
and you can, like I said, you can
be able to get that on Amazon,

2303
02:26:10,040 --> 02:26:12,220
see a click through the,
get it on Amazon.

2304
02:26:12,970 --> 02:26:16,000
You can also go ahead and get by the
below book called extreme ownership when

2305
02:26:16,001 --> 02:26:20,290
you're there you recommend. Yup,
and you can get that anywhere.

2306
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:23,230
Anywhere they sell books.
You can buy the hardcover.

2307
02:26:23,231 --> 02:26:24,760
He can buy the digital audio format,

2308
02:26:24,820 --> 02:26:28,210
which my brother Leif
Babin and I actually read.

2309
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:32,590
You can get it for your people up and
down the chain of command, your friends,

2310
02:26:32,591 --> 02:26:37,210
family, whoever it is that you think
needs to get on board with the program,

2311
02:26:37,270 --> 02:26:40,150
get him a copy.
That's kind of a good initiator forum.

2312
02:26:41,680 --> 02:26:46,300
And also October 20th
and 21st in San Diego,

2313
02:26:46,301 --> 02:26:51,301
we are having the extreme ownership
muster that is also Leif Babin and myself.

2314
02:26:52,330 --> 02:26:54,130
We're going to be getting granular,

2315
02:26:55,420 --> 02:27:00,420
granular with the combat leadership
lessons that we learned on the battlefield

2316
02:27:01,210 --> 02:27:04,810
and how you apply those
lessons in your business

2317
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:07,510
and in your life.

2318
02:27:10,710 --> 02:27:13,410
Now that event is going to be

2319
02:27:15,160 --> 02:27:18,910
extremely interactive. It's more not
going to be hiding behind the curtain.

2320
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:22,330
We're going to be out front with
the troops. If you got questions,

2321
02:27:22,331 --> 02:27:26,230
we are going to answer them.
If you got something you need,

2322
02:27:26,231 --> 02:27:28,900
we're going to talk about it.
If you've got a problem,

2323
02:27:28,930 --> 02:27:30,310
we're going to come up with a solution.

2324
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:33,760
I say we because it we were going to
work together. We're going to learn.

2325
02:27:33,820 --> 02:27:35,680
I can't wait to see how much
I'm going to learn with the,

2326
02:27:36,120 --> 02:27:38,380
the list of people that
are coming is awesome.

2327
02:27:38,560 --> 02:27:43,560
It every industry you could imagine every
level of leadership you can imagine.

2328
02:27:43,930 --> 02:27:44,763
It's just,

2329
02:27:44,800 --> 02:27:48,880
it's really going to be fired up and
laugh and I've been hammered out the

2330
02:27:48,881 --> 02:27:53,881
schedule and there's so much material
and so much good information and so much

2331
02:27:54,341 --> 02:27:58,150
good content. It's going to be awesome
and I cannot wait to kick it off.

2332
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,840
Or do you just do part of the schedule?

2333
02:28:01,900 --> 02:28:04,120
Jujitsu is not on the schedule,

2334
02:28:04,390 --> 02:28:09,390
but what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to basically have a Jujitsu situation

2335
02:28:09,461 --> 02:28:12,340
happening at the gym. So the
event is Thursday, Friday,

2336
02:28:12,550 --> 02:28:15,070
so maybe it's going to be Wednesday night.
If people come in early,

2337
02:28:15,430 --> 02:28:16,540
maybe it's going to be Saturday.

2338
02:28:16,541 --> 02:28:20,750
If people want to stay or Sunday
people want to stay the weekend. So,

2339
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:24,710
or just have them like where they're like,
you know, the welcome come to the gym.

2340
02:28:24,711 --> 02:28:24,891
You know,

2341
02:28:24,891 --> 02:28:28,700
like these are the things from the moment
I could just bring some mats to the

2342
02:28:28,701 --> 02:28:32,520
hotel and do some kind of a, but
now when they, then we got to,

2343
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:36,190
now Jim is way better because
it's like that, you know,

2344
02:28:36,200 --> 02:28:38,780
one of the best people to
the gym. Yeah. So yeah,

2345
02:28:38,870 --> 02:28:40,400
if you want to get the Jujitsu together,

2346
02:28:40,430 --> 02:28:42,810
we are going to get the Jimmy and I
trained Jujitsu. I'm in San Diego,

2347
02:28:42,811 --> 02:28:46,550
I'm training, so we'll be in
San Diego. We will be training,

2348
02:28:46,880 --> 02:28:51,750
we might not be able to do it Thursday
night because it's a packed schedule. Um,

2349
02:28:51,960 --> 02:28:53,360
doesn't end until late at night,

2350
02:28:53,361 --> 02:28:58,361
but either Wednesday night or probably
probably once the monsters over cause

2351
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:03,980
head heading into the monster.
I'm going to be like David.

2352
02:29:04,110 --> 02:29:06,860
Actually I think it would go. No, I
have an event earlier in the week,

2353
02:29:06,861 --> 02:29:09,080
so probably going to be
the weekend if you want.

2354
02:29:09,081 --> 02:29:13,500
If you want to get your Jujitsu on, stay
the weekend. Yeah. Home Sunday afternoon,

2355
02:29:13,530 --> 02:29:16,490
get a red eye flight back to
the east coast or whatever and,

2356
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:19,160
or if you're out here,
just go home Sunday night.

2357
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:23,130
And that's kind of um,
just muster. No mustard.

2358
02:29:23,131 --> 02:29:25,660
People come in and they're like, hey,
I want to come in that gym. Yeah,

2359
02:29:25,830 --> 02:29:30,060
but guys have comms getting Max. I
just, I just met him and his girlfriend,

2360
02:29:30,061 --> 02:29:34,020
his wife, I forget if they're married now,
but they came in and he was like, Hey,

2361
02:29:34,021 --> 02:29:37,290
um, you know, I just came in
and whatever. Um, so yeah,

2362
02:29:37,291 --> 02:29:40,950
people would just come in and they just
let him into, of course, you know? Yeah.

2363
02:29:43,610 --> 02:29:44,570
Also a look.

2364
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:49,520
I know that the monster is expensive
and in this situation, guess what?

2365
02:29:49,521 --> 02:29:53,420
It costs money to put it on. It costs
money for the hotel room, the event,

2366
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:58,280
the event room, the Food Dav
equipment, the security, the logistics,

2367
02:29:58,281 --> 02:30:00,320
all that stuff.
It costs money.

2368
02:30:00,321 --> 02:30:05,321
And the reason that we're investing in
it is because we want it to be the best.

2369
02:30:06,410 --> 02:30:10,760
We want it to be.
The best event that you have ever been to.

2370
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:12,920
That's what I want.
That's all.

2371
02:30:13,700 --> 02:30:16,640
And but that does cost money.

2372
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:20,810
And so if you can't afford to
come out to it, you know what,

2373
02:30:21,620 --> 02:30:26,180
I apologize the, but the podcast
is free. The book is 20 bucks.

2374
02:30:26,870 --> 02:30:30,200
Um,
get what you can out of that.

2375
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:32,030
But if you can't afford to come out,

2376
02:30:33,110 --> 02:30:38,110
come on out because you being there is
going to make us all better because every

2377
02:30:39,141 --> 02:30:43,310
single person that I get so
many responses on Twitter,

2378
02:30:43,311 --> 02:30:45,080
I get so many stuff,
so much stuff through,

2379
02:30:45,110 --> 02:30:50,110
through the social media that
I'm learning from everyone here.

2380
02:30:50,871 --> 02:30:55,130
So anybody that can come
out and participate and ask
that question or give that

2381
02:30:55,131 --> 02:30:59,690
scenario or give that piece of input
is going to make us all better.

2382
02:30:59,691 --> 02:31:03,380
So come on out and get some.
And

2383
02:31:05,660 --> 02:31:10,130
as always,
if you want to continue this conversation,

2384
02:31:10,370 --> 02:31:14,480
you know where you can
find us all up on that.

2385
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:18,980
Andrew Labs, Twitter,
Instagram, and that Facebook,

2386
02:31:19,010 --> 02:31:19,843

2387

and I am at Jocko Willink.

2388
02:31:28,021 --> 02:31:29,640
And finally

2389
02:31:30,880 --> 02:31:31,713
to you,

2390
02:31:32,720 --> 02:31:35,940
to those of you out there in the battle,

2391
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:41,250
our military guys in Iraq and in Syria,

2392
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:44,190
fighting against a truly evil,

2393
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:46,290
an abhorrent enemy.

2394
02:31:47,920 --> 02:31:48,753
Okay.

2395
02:31:48,820 --> 02:31:52,720
Stay Sharp,
stay focused and be aggressive.

2396
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:59,560
It'll keep you alive to
the police officers who are
suffering through hard times

2397
02:32:04,221 --> 02:32:07,580
right now, verbal and physical
attacks. I'm going to tell you,

2398
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:10,250
take the high ground in both those cases.

2399
02:32:11,700 --> 02:32:16,700
Detach from that negativity and do
your job to the best of your ability.

2400
02:32:19,260 --> 02:32:21,960
Be Smart and stay safe.

2401
02:32:23,700 --> 02:32:26,830
And of course the firefighters
and emergency medical teams

2402
02:32:28,360 --> 02:32:29,620
that keep us safe,

2403
02:32:30,850 --> 02:32:35,850
keep us healthy and come
to us in our time of need.

2404
02:32:37,180 --> 02:32:40,390
You all stay vigilant and train hard.

2405
02:32:41,660 --> 02:32:42,493
Yeah.

2406
02:32:42,580 --> 02:32:47,580
And to the rest of you troopers out there
all over the world doing what you are

2407
02:32:50,261 --> 02:32:51,094
doing.

2408
02:32:51,130 --> 02:32:56,080
Make sure you do that thing with
every ounce of effort you got

2409
02:32:58,820 --> 02:33:01,280
and make sure you stay,

2410
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:03,250
yeah.

2411
02:33:03,250 --> 02:33:08,090
Stay on the war path
and get after it.

2412
02:33:11,250 --> 02:33:12,960
So until next time,

2413
02:33:14,340 --> 02:33:16,980
this is echo and Jocko.

2414
02:33:21,720 --> 02:33:21,770
Okay.
