00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,810
This is Jocko podcast number
104 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,790
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,380
We're going to go right
into Q and. A. Cool.

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,570
I don't think there's anything to
discuss. Let's do it. Let's do it then.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,410
It's Q and a. It's Q and a time.
All right, question number one.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,460
You discuss leading and maneuvering
up and down the chain of command,

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,510
but what about laterally within your
own peer group where the competition for

8
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:32,160
advancement is fiercest and your ability
to sit team objectives and implement

9
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:36,720
some of the tools you discuss is limited.
Okay,

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,270
so you,

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,270
you absolutely do have to lead laterally
amongst your peers and since you don't

12
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,880
have rank or position,
you have to do it another way.

13
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,360
But wait a second,

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,830
since you shouldn't use rank or position
to lead people below you in the chain

15
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:59,060
of command and since you don't want to
be led by someone that's throwing their

16
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:01,190
rank and position around,
then guess what?

17
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,170
You need to do the same type of leadership
that you would use up and down the

18
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:09,890
chain of command to lead your peers.
So what does that mean?

19
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,320
That means you'll help them when you can.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,930
You support what they're doing. You
try and build a relationship with them.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,520
That's what you're
trying to do. Now, this,

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,790
this part of this that we're
talking about, the competitiveness,

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,500
like if they want to maneuver and try
and make you look bad and jump in the

24
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:31,880
spotlight and try and get all the
credit, guess what? That's fine.

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,583
That's fine.

26
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,130
Let them do it and everyone is going to
see what they're doing and they might

27
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:43,130
not see it immediately,
but they will eventually be found out.

28
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,850
So do your best to support them.
Do your best to help them.

29
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,140
Do your best to build the relationships.

30
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,180
Make the mission the most important thing,

31
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,510
not the little politics that you're
about to dive into and get involved in.

32
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,160
Don't make that the primary thing.

33
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:59,750
Make the primary thing
accomplishing the mission.

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,863
Hmm?

35
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,400
Think about this.
If you start fighting with them a year,

36
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:08,870
expending energy on fighting your
own team, that's what you're doing.

37
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,020
Instead of fighting the enemy, it's,
this is a blue on blue situation.

38
00:02:12,021 --> 00:02:15,200
This is a friendly fire is fratricide.
Don't do that.

39
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:19,640
Disengage from the friendly fire and
focus on how to make the team win.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,733
Hmm.

41
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,370
Take the high ground.

42
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,200
Take the high ground or the high ground.
We'll take you.

43
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah.
Okay.

44
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,340
Another one of those
points that we always say,

45
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,420
I know I do and I always think
this where people are watching men,

46
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,910
they see that and they see
that you see all that stuff,

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,900
but let's play this game too.

48
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,880
You know the game where I play
with like who would you hire?

49
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,860
Who would you rather have working for you?

50
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,910
Who would you rather have working for you?
The Guy, the guy, oh, you got four guys.

51
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,200
One guy is helping the other guys out
trying to help them with their mission.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,880
One Guy,

53
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,040
the other end of the spectrum
is undermining people
trying to make himself look

54
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,220
good. Which guy are you going
to promote? Yeah. All Day long.

55
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:04,580
You know who you're going to promote.
Yeah.

56
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,690
You're going to promote the guy that's
trying to help the team win and not just

57
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,500
look out for himself. Yeah. Yeah.

58
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:15,160
Fully and consider that
with not just your boss,

59
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:18,160
but like your peers as well. You
know, even if there's competition,

60
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,970
let's say there's everyone's
competing. Well, yeah,

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,310
and you're the guy who's jumping
in the spotlight always, whatever.

62
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,850
Versus the other guy who's always
helping everyone. Even the,

63
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:30,560
even if they're competing with you,
for sure, I was dumping the spotlight.

64
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,280
He's going to get ostracized if
anything, you know, so man, yeah, they,

65
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,520
they see that stuff, man, that goes
socially. You know what? Now, now,

66
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,910
now answer me this.

67
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,170
When someone sees the world this way,

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,110
that means to have a
tendency to think that way.

69
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,120
That means they might have
a tendency to act this way.

70
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,940
So they're going to be especially
cautious if you're looking at everyone,

71
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,730
like while I'm trying to
compete with that guy anyway,

72
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,710
I might be getting screwed over
if I don't, if, if I let him,

73
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,380
you don't get the spotlight right now.
If that's the way you're thinking,

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,890
that's the way you're acting and if you're
acting that way, everybody can see it.

75
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,420
Yeah. Don't act that way. Don't act
that way. Be a good team member. Yeah.

76
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,600
The enemy is outside the wire.
Yeah, that's a good one too.

77
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:15,160
Where the good news about that is like
let's say you are acting in that way,

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,170
as long as you can admit it to yourself.

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,200
Even if you do have those feelings
inside, but you're like, hey,

80
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,060
I don't want to act like that,
and you start,

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,050
even if you know it's kind of against
her feelings and then you start acting

82
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,700
that way slowly and slowly.

83
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,820
Your feelings kind of accommodate
where you don't feel that way anymore.

84
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
You'll start to feel that way.

85
00:04:31,841 --> 00:04:35,770
Let's start to realize how you should
act as a human being. As a team member,

86
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:40,150
as a leader, as a follower,
you'll grow up, you'll mature,
you'll be a good person.

87
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,630
Yeah. Feel the benefits as opposed to just
looking out for yourself at school and

88
00:04:43,631 --> 00:04:47,620
over. The other team. One is against
me, check, kill or be killed.

89
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,653
Next question.

90
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,140
My jujitsu school is small and I'm a white
belt under three months and there are

91
00:04:55,421 --> 00:05:00,070
typically two or three blues and maybe
a purple belt in the class with us.

92
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,680
When I trained her spar with
the blue and purple belts,

93
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,030
I can win the advantage or submit
them more than half the time.

94
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,530
They don't like me because of this.
I like what my is teaching,

95
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:14,290
but I feel I need more of a challenge.

96
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,030
Should I find more a more competitive
school? Your time is appreciated.

97
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,330
Okay, so there's something very
sus suspect going on. Yeah. Uh,

98
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,500
there's something wrong with the school.

99
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,090
If you're a white belt that
can submit blues and purples,
and I don't know, maybe,

100
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,990
maybe if you're 500 pounds
or just a super athlete,

101
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,230
like your normal person,
even if you wrestled in high school,

102
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,220
maybe even if you wrestled
in college and you,

103
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:44,740
you've been training Jujitsu
for three months, do,

104
00:05:44,741 --> 00:05:49,170
you should not be submitting purple belts.
That should not be happening. There's,

105
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,730
there's now there's a
small chance of tiny,

106
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,490
tiny chance that they're just being like,

107
00:05:54,491 --> 00:05:59,120
so super cool that they're letting that,
like they're saying, oh yeah, you know,

108
00:05:59,130 --> 00:05:59,871
all that was good.
You know,

109
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:02,100
you caught me my arm and it
was just giving it to you.

110
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,350
Just too dumb to realize that.

111
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,760
But since you're saying that they don't
like you because you're submitting them,

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,680
that, that, that's very unlikely
that they're just super nice. So, uh,

113
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,790
I think you may actually be
in a fraudulent situation
where the school is not a

114
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,670
proper school and I haven't
heard one of these in a while,

115
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,940
but you're a white belt should
not be on the regular sub meeting.

116
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,160
A blue belt and definitely a purple
belt or any purple belts. Yeah.

117
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,620
If there's a massive size differential,

118
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,510
it'd be an occasional occurrence. Yeah.
But on the regular shouldn't be happening.

119
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,160
Yeah. Right. Correct. That. Yeah. I mean,

120
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,290
unless again,
like there's maybe,

121
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,730
and maybe it's a small school,
you know, there's, you know,

122
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:53,210
a few people maybe like some real
old people or something like that.

123
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:56,990
Maybe this guy, I don't know how
big he is, but let's say he was too,

124
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,190
I'm getting real specific here.
Right.

125
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:04,210
What a fees to 25 solid
[inaudible] six to [inaudible]

126
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,630
may or may not have been
a college wrestler. Okay.

127
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:16,150
Learned a few chokes guillotine.
Yeah. Um, oh, go ahead.

128
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:21,151
And arm arm bar to 25
college wrestler six to yeah,

129
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,870
he knows basic submissions that,
that, that could be problematic.

130
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,470
And then the rest of the people,

131
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,180
those may be like a 65 year old,

132
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,410
hundred 3,545 pounds. Um, he, you know,

133
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,700
if there's no extreme,
um,

134
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,340
disparity between you and the other
students, yeah, we have a problem.

135
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,350
If there's an extreme disparity,

136
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,470
even then you should go look
around because even if you're,

137
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,340
even if you're a 225 pounds,
six foot two wrestled in college,

138
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:55,890
most purple belts,

139
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:59,830
you'd be able to handle you if you've
only been traded for two months. Yes, yes.

140
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,780
Yet so, yeah, even three men,

141
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,700
and not to say my situation and soul,
the, here's proof. I'm not saying that,

142
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,840
but just an example, I was two
when I started. I was two 25

143
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,180
I'd say when I really settled into it,
I lost it got down to about two 15,

144
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:22,740
two 20. Oh. And I was the white
belt over three months, by the way.

145
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,160
And I rolled with this guy, George was
his name. You might remember him small,

146
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,430
teeny go a

147
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,970
purple belt and no chance I
had with this guy and I was,

148
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,350
so this is more than
three months by the way,

149
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,480
is after I started competing
in there, which is good too.
Yeah. Purple Belts. Yeah.

150
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,230
He's the one who taught me
first bite guard by the way.
For sure. And Jimmy. Yeah.

151
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,780
But yeah, no chance purple belt like
him. You have no chance against. Yeah.

152
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,810
But this is not a big guy. This
is know five, six not, you know,

153
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,990
I think you might be smaller
than five. Six. Yeah. He's
a small guy. I light. Yeah.

154
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,630
Yeah. That's a great example. That's
great example. I'm trying to think.

155
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,400
I mean,
when I started Jujitsu I was 215 pounds.

156
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,280
Who else?
Bigger than 215 pounds.

157
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,230
And Dean was a blue belt.
Just got his blue belt.

158
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,730
Yeah. And I had no chance.
Yeah. You know what I mean?

159
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,680
By the way, I forgot to mention
Dean weighed 174 pounds. So yeah,

160
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,680
it's very similar.
Yeah.

161
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:26,560
You'd have to like get the disparity
between the two with blue tack to be,

162
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,680
oh, so what do you think it is then? I
think it might be a fraudulent school.

163
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,490
Like how, like what the instructor, the
instructor is not a real black belt.

164
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,320
The instructor knows he's watched enough
youtube to show an arm lock and he can

165
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:44,640
actually do it on the purple belt
because he he's bigger and stronger or

166
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:48,480
something and he knows a little bit
better cause it's facing. If you, if,

167
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,650
if you're,
uh,

168
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,100
if you watched youtube and you studied
as hard as I could as you could and you

169
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:55,800
owned a school and you
trained all the time,

170
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,010
you could be a blue belt level and then
you can beat the other blue belts that

171
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:06,120
you taught and then gave the boob
cause you gave yourself a black belt.

172
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,900
That's probably what's going on.
That's crazy.

173
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,930
Now whoever this is hit me up again and
tell me what your school is on Facebook

174
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,900
or wherever this question, once
you do that and once you, you know,

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,260
I dunno. I Dunno. I mean,
is that a, is that like a,

176
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,850
is that a hard move to be like, Hey,
this is my school and put it out there,

177
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,590
you know,
and here's my instructor.

178
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,210
I mean on one hand you want to think
if the instructor is legit? No, no, no.

179
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,790
That's what I would want to know. I
want it if the, if the guy wasn't legit,

180
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,760
I dunno what I do. I don't have a plan
for that. But if the guy was legit,

181
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,920
I'd come back on here and
say, Oh, here's the situation.

182
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,730
When you found out that
this is what's going on,

183
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,800
you are a six to 285 pound collegiate
NCAA champion wrestler and you studied

184
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,920
sambo or Jew. Like if somebody had Sambor
judo under their belt, that's true.

185
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,320
But you wouldn't even be asking this
question if you had that under your belt

186
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:01,860
because you know the answer
to. Yeah, man. So yeah,

187
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,720
I think the chance of that is, it's fair.
It's a fair chance, fraudulent situation.

188
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,360
I haven't haven't seen too
many of those lately. Yeah,

189
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,490
because that's a rare thing.
The Internet can mop those up now.

190
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,940
It used to be all kinds of fraudulent
schools. Yeah, it makes sense.

191
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,060
Let me think about it. The Internet
is all over everything. Oh yeah.

192
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
You get even halfway fraudulent person.
Yeah. It's like, Oh God, is this guy like,

193
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,550
you know what I mean? Is like, man, you're
really held to the Kohl's, so I dunno.

194
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:30,120
Maybe two it up.
Yeah,

195
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,300
I was going to say she, we have some kind
of thing on our website where we have,

196
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,830
if you're legit school,

197
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,190
like a Jocko approved school in theory
is how many times a day do you get asked?

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,320
I live in Tennessee where
structuring and I live in Chicago.

199
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:50,220
Where should I train? How many times
do you get asked that? A day. Half.

200
00:11:50,221 --> 00:11:54,950
So every other day is, is that about
okay? You get ask more than that, I guess.

201
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,490
A lot more than you.
Maybe not tons more,

202
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:01,180
but definitely I could ask repeatedly.
Worst I train.

203
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,830
I live in Jacksonville, Florida. Where
should I train? I live in wherever,

204
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:10,000
Concord, New Hampshire. Where do I, where
should I train? I live in Salt Lake City.

205
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,830
Utah. You know what I mean?
People are always asking about,

206
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,060
the only risk with that is like, okay, so
first off, we don't know all the schools.

207
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:17,430
We've probably don't even
know half the schools.

208
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,770
And just cause you say you're under Hixon,
it doesn't mean you're legit. You know,

209
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,170
we'd have to have some sort of an approval
process and then at the end of the

210
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,340
day,
let's say you approve,

211
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,630
I dunno cause some place
and then it then or no, no.

212
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,510
Or people will be like, okay, here's
the page or the website or whatever.

213
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,060
They'll be like, okay, this
school that I'm like looking at,

214
00:12:37,061 --> 00:12:40,150
I like it but it's not on this list.
I don't know.

215
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,060
We didn't get to it kind of thing.
And then it gets kind of like the Dean,

216
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,870
you know? And that way it shouldn't
be that much of a problem. By the way,

217
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,370
there's not that many fraudulent schools.

218
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,580
We're talking about one right now
possibly. But there's not many out there.

219
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,300
Although there are some, they're
like, they're in strip malls.

220
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,140
You drive by like a strip mall and
you see something that says Jujitsu.

221
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,840
Now there's legit schools.
You're him. He's his legitimacy.

222
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,720
It's hard, man. I Dunno. But yeah,

223
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,500
the,

224
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,070
there's actually strip malls is actually
the normal place for Jujitsu schools

225
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,230
now that I think about it.
There's a lot of crazy.

226
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,100
Here's the one that's
straight up in the mall.

227
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,630
Oh that's not a strip mall
than a mall. Yeah, Mall Mall.

228
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:27,060
I'm going to have to go
visit. Come Prieto. Yeah.

229
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,220
See if you watched that video I did with
them for Metamorris a long time ago.

230
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:33,760
It's like kill. I forget if it was in the
outtakes or not, but there's this cool,

231
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,360
you know those trains that go around
the mall for the kids. He's like,

232
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,510
I hate that you to train because
it always comes by my academy.

233
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,690
That's funny cause especially
cause computers such a nice guy.

234
00:13:43,691 --> 00:13:47,250
You figured he'd be like, I love
that. That's exactly how he said it.

235
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,290
They totally me, but he says I hate it.
Meanwhile he's smiling and laughing.

236
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,610
It's very interesting.

237
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,480
Dichotomy can wait more
information needed on this academy.

238
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,153
Next question.

239
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,460
I am seeing at work as a very assertive
and aggressive dude and I seem to rub

240
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:08,170
people the wrong way when they think
I'm upset or frustrated at problems they

241
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,880
they present, which is rarely
the case. I'm just so fired up.

242
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,890
How do I work on Mike hacked while
still being assertive with my team?

243
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,850
You know what, I'm fired up too. Sure.

244
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,270
How you liked that Jagan and
when I was young I, this is

245
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,990
when I was younger. Sure. I
rubbed some people the wrong way.

246
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,530
I know that even when I was a young
kid working on a construction site,

247
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:34,180
guess what?
I was doing work in too hard,

248
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,260
making people rubbing people the
wrong way. When I got to the team,

249
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,030
those little crew of us that were too
hardcore, we were too fired up. We were,

250
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:46,450
I would run the o course with my,

251
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,680
with with a rucksack with a 40 pound pack,
a 40 pound sandbag on it.

252
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,010
No one was doing that,

253
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,210
like everyone does it now.

254
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:56,240
But back then there was a small
crew of us that were doing it,

255
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,330
running with jungle boots all
the time instead of in sneakers.

256
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,570
And I literally got pulled aside by
some of the old guys. And by old guys,

257
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:09,530
I don't mean nom, I mean old guys
from wherever, uh, you know, from the,

258
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,270
from the nineties or late eighties.
And you know,

259
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:18,740
I'd get the, hey, you just need to calm
down dude. You know, you need to do that.

260
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,690
And so yeah, maybe I wrote those guys a
little bit the wrong way. Understandable.

261
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,050
But when I got a little older
and a little bit more mature,

262
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,550
I got fired up to actually do a good
job as a leader to actually build

263
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:36,260
relationships with my platoon mates.

264
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,500
And I got fired up.

265
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:40,543
Hmm.

266
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,280
For people to,

267
00:15:42,281 --> 00:15:46,210
instead of thinking that I was upset or
frustrated what I was fired up because I

268
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:49,570
wanted people to think that I was
calm and cool and collected. Right.

269
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,550
So how's that for?
Don't totally different.

270
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,480
It's like when we say default
aggressive. Yeah. And I always say, hey,

271
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:56,860
you're not being aggressive and
being aggressive towards your people.

272
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:59,560
It's not yelling. It's being
aggressive towards the mission. I was,

273
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,850
I'm aggressive towards making people think
that I'm not upset and that no matter

274
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,520
what's going on and they just
go, man, Jack was, he's not
going to lose his temper.

275
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:10,090
He's a super levelheaded right now.

276
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,770
Now that being shit,
that doesn't mean that I was passive.

277
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,590
Sure.
That doesn't mean that I wasn't assertive.

278
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,200
It means that I was
aggressive and assertive,

279
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:23,440
but I did it with tact and instead
of coming at people straight on,

280
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,550
I flanked them.

281
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:31,190
I've listened to their little ideas
or I made their ideas come from me,

282
00:16:31,651 --> 00:16:35,270
but they didn't know it. I listened to
their solutions. I helped him support it.

283
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:35,690
Well,

284
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,690
how you go so far just by helping people
out and helping them with their idea

285
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:42,720
instead of trying to control them
and make everything your idea.

286
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,520
So that's my advice here.
Relax.

287
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,050
Calm down, focus, get fired up,

288
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:56,940
get aggressive about being tactful.
Get aggressive about working with people.

289
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,650
Get aggressive about
showing your calmness.

290
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,360
That's what you get aggressive about.
Don't get assertive,

291
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:11,190
aggressive and create antagonistic
relationships across your company.

292
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,130
Check. Yeah. Good. He said he,

293
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:21,131
he gets or they think he gets upset or
frustrated at problems that they present,

294
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,740
which is rarely the case. He said, he
said, I'm just fired up. So it's, it's,

295
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,580
it seems like,
and I'm no expert,

296
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:33,300
but I'm trying to put myself
in a position where like,

297
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:37,590
I think maybe like it,
it's just a presentation thing,

298
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,550
you know, like yeah, it definitely
has a presentation is aggressive.

299
00:17:41,551 --> 00:17:43,230
Like he's saying he's not
even getting frustrated.

300
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,220
I'm getting frustrated with him
for fracking this, right? Yeah,

301
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,740
like a mindset.
Yeah,

302
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,880
definitely. It's definitely a
presentation thing. No doubt about it.

303
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:59,130
But so that means you say, okay,
I'm presenting the wrong thing.

304
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,210
I will fix what I'm presenting it.

305
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Do you think actually I think you do
think this or know this or whatever.

306
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,410
Oh, you know how people, they'll, they'll
get nuts or whatever. They'll, they'll,

307
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,400
they'll be aggressive.
They get fired up. Right.

308
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,690
And you know,
the,

309
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:21,840
whether it be they'll lose their
temper or their behave in a way that's,

310
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:26,841
that's aggressive towards people and their
justification is not to say that this

311
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:29,370
guy does this.
I don't know.

312
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:34,110
But I'm just saying their justification
is I'm just passionate about it.

313
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,120
I'm just whatever, you know. Um, is that,

314
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,840
that's just the justification,
right? It is because, yeah. Yeah.

315
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:46,440
Like if at the end of the day it is,
it's a joke. It's a justification.

316
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,210
It is also a reality. So think about
it from the other perspective. If,

317
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,180
if you're dealing with someone,

318
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:55,230
if you have someone on your team that
gets all that they're passionate about

319
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,870
something and it can be problematic
if they don't learn to control their

320
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,110
passions, right? Cause they just get,
Hey, we're gonna make this happen.

321
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:05,040
And they make bad decisions
because they're so passionate
about making something

322
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:08,340
happen that there dot did not
doing something logical. So yes,

323
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:10,920
you could say it's just an excuse and
there's no such thing as a passionate

324
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:15,150
person. But that actually
wouldn't be true. It's not
an excuse. It's a real thing.

325
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,830
Now, if you are aware of that, then
why do you keep acting that way?

326
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,950
You've got to put your passions
into check. That's what
you got to do. 100%. Yeah.

327
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,920
And I meant more like it's an
excuse for their behavior. You know,

328
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:30,870
like to me,
I personally,

329
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:34,580
I think that being passionate about
something that you're into is good way

330
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,660
beneficial of course.
But again,

331
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:40,230
you know how to say like
there's a difference between
what you feel and how you

332
00:19:40,231 --> 00:19:44,310
behave, you know? So if you're, if
you're super passionate about something,

333
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:45,230
it doesn't justify it.

334
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,010
Like all this aid rational or emotional
or like loss of temper situation,

335
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,280
behavior. You see what I'm
saying? So, you know, yeah,

336
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,200
be passionate but don't behave
in some crazy off the handle with

337
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:04,410
agree. So I think that they use their
passion as an excuse for their behavior.

338
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,820
I just got a quick temper
man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

339
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,750
It doesn't mean that you can
act like that's worse. That's

340
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,560
exactly right. Yeah. That's just who I
am. I'm unique in that way. Next question.

341
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,390
My wife told me that she thinks our
11 year old daughter is being bullied

342
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:25,170
emotionally by some girls at school.
As I drove into work,

343
00:20:25,171 --> 00:20:30,171
I wondered if Jujitsu would give her some
tools to help her deal with emotional

344
00:20:31,141 --> 00:20:33,870
stress and or bullying
that might be taking place.

345
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:38,250
I think we all know the answer that Daca
will give to this question. Absolutely.

346
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:43,251
Jujitsu will help 11 years old as a
perfect age for getting in there and you

347
00:20:43,801 --> 00:20:44,640
will learn to,

348
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,310
she will learn to defend herself for
real and physical confrontations,

349
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:50,350
which will give her real confrontation,

350
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,320
which will give her confidence
because let's face it,

351
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,860
emotional and verbal bullying is
absolutely backed up by a either

352
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,680
clear message of possible violence or a
subliminal message of possible violence,

353
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,670
right? I mean a big group of girl
that's getting picked on the, the,

354
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,220
the underlying messages there,

355
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:21,250
the implied messages there that it's,

356
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,820
it could go physical if it had to and
when that gets removed because the,

357
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,020
the daughter knows how to
now fight and defend herself,

358
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,000
that starts to impact these
emotional bullies as well. So yes,

359
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:37,870
absolutely get her training.
I would throw some boxing in there too,

360
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,570
just because that is a
pretty empowering thing.

361
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:43,810
You've punched in something that
feels good and you, you know what,

362
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:48,310
while we're at it, let's get some working
out going on. Right. Get a pull up bar.

363
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,790
Get away of the warrior kid
nick. No kidding. Absolutely.

364
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:55,900
Get her way of the warrior kid.
Don't baby her too much. Yeah,

365
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,630
you gotta be careful of that because
she's your daughter and you say, Oh,

366
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,660
you know, it's so horrible and
these girls are picking a, don't,

367
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:03,580
don't do that because guess what?

368
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,210
She's going to be dealing with this their
whole life you're going to be getting,

369
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:11,020
there's always bullies in every
environment, in the school environment,

370
00:22:11,021 --> 00:22:13,240
in the work environment,
in everywhere.

371
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,480
There's bullies and she's going to
have to deal with them. So don't,

372
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,930
don't baby her where she thinks that
you're the one that's going to save her

373
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:24,460
from it. Um, and I also think should
know that everyone gets bullied.

374
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:28,840
I got asked that when way the warrior
could came out. Hmm. Someone said,

375
00:22:28,841 --> 00:22:30,250
what did you get bullied?
And they think,

376
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:34,570
of course I would never get bullied
because I'm a big dude. Well,

377
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:38,140
guess what?
When I was nine years old,

378
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,200
I was a scrawny little nine year old kid
and every buddy that was 11 was bigger

379
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:44,790
than me and stronger than me.
Yeah.

380
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,250
And then when I was 11 everyone that was
13 was bigger than me and stronger than

381
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:48,740
me.

382
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,750
And when I was 14 everyone that was 16
was bigger than me and stronger than me.

383
00:22:52,751 --> 00:22:55,180
So no matter who you are as a kid,

384
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,280
there's always somebody that the bigger
and stronger than you that's going to

385
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,660
bully you if they're a jerk.

386
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:03,250
So I think she should understand
that she's getting bullied right now.

387
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:07,550
But that's, that happens to people and
people get over it and get through it.

388
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,003
Okay.

389
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,440
I, I do think you have to be, when you
say that you can't leave the imprint,

390
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:19,441
you can't overwhelm her and say everyone
gets bullied and you can always get

391
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,340
bullied in the office,
all, you know what I mean?

392
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:24,940
Like I'm not saying to overwhelm her.
I think that's just like, there's a,

393
00:23:24,941 --> 00:23:28,040
there's a lot. Did you
ever see that movie, that
professional? Which one was it?

394
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,970
The French guy. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

395
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,810
There's a great scene in
that movie where the girl is,

396
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,230
there's like a crazy fight going on
between her parents in the apartment.

397
00:23:38,231 --> 00:23:39,011
They're yelling at each other,

398
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:42,160
the screaming and just slapping people
that domestic violence is going on and

399
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:46,100
she comes out and she's sitting in
the hallway. Yeah. And she's crying

400
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,880
and the assassin guy kind of walks up
the stairs and she looks and he looks at

401
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:56,540
her and she looks at him and she says,

402
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,520
is life always like this or does
it get better when you get older?

403
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,270
And he looks at her and says,
always like this.

404
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,190
So you've got to be careful that that's
not the message that you're sending. Now.

405
00:24:10,191 --> 00:24:13,000
There is some reality to that
statement. Like, yeah, guess what?

406
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,550
Life is always going to be hard and
you do want to give your kids enough

407
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:21,551
exposure to the hard thing so that
they're not weak and they don't,

408
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,340
they don't go into panic mode when
something tough enters their world.

409
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,520
So that's why things like Jujitsu when
working out are good and exposing them

410
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:35,750
and letting them experience
some hard things.

411
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,780
But again, you just don't
want to overwhelm her. And
that's that. And by the way,

412
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,220
you might as well start training Jujitsu
to their dad. The mom in there too. Yeah.

413
00:24:46,221 --> 00:24:49,550
Now you've got an excuse to get
down in that gym Jujitsu on,

414
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,130
and I know you that you don't
train Jujitsu. Cause if you did,

415
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:54,470
you wouldn't be asking this question.
You'd be getting,

416
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,380
getting her training
you making that happen.

417
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,780
So emotionally bullied.
Right. So this is interesting.

418
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:07,760
She's in the new warrior kid book,
the bully. There's a bully in there,

419
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:11,240
but he's not a bully like Kenny
Williamson, who's a big, strong bully.

420
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,300
He's a bully.
That's an emotional Bulleit Kinda is d.

421
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,000
And every time there's seems like
there's going to be a confrontation,

422
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:20,930
he finds a way to weasel out of it.
Yeah. You know, so he'll harass people,

423
00:25:20,931 --> 00:25:24,440
but then he'll get harassed people. He
knows perfectly how to push the buttons.

424
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,490
That's what the marks are dealing with.

425
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,810
This kid named Nathan
James Vaguely from Nathan.

426
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:34,040
James Causes Problems. Yeah, there's
some layers in that name for sure.

427
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,500
That, so this, this makes a lot of
sense to me. Cause I have a daughter,

428
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,080
four and a half by the
way, goes to pre k pre k.

429
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:49,910
Is that the Jujitsu school?
She goes, no, no Bruh. Anyway,

430
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,680
so she instructor, she
told him you one day. Um,

431
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:59,030
she said that her friends,

432
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:01,080
I'm not gonna say their
name doesn't matter. Um,

433
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,580
she said this friend told
me that she's not my friend.

434
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,600
She's only this other girl's friend.
That's emotional.

435
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,560
That's emotional bullying.
Right?

436
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,440
Then for the four and a half year old
version of it gets way worse at 11,

437
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:21,980
by the way. And then
probably way worth it. 1516.

438
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:27,350
It's just my assumption. So what I told
her, not to say this is the right answer,

439
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:29,180
but maybe the thing to think about.

440
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,770
So my daughter does digit two has done,

441
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,080
you get to double leg choke.
I like it.

442
00:26:36,081 --> 00:26:40,040
Well that's what you want to
say. Yeah, you'd smashed it.

443
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,850
And she's bigger too. She's
bigger than, than everyone,
you know. So she's going to,

444
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,500
no. All right, so what was
your, what'd you tell her?

445
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:48,870
My daughter is trained to be nice for.
Okay.

446
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,870
So I always have this underlying thing.
No matter if someone be's mean to you,

447
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:54,480
that doesn't mean you be mean to them.
That makes you mean person.

448
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:57,930
I said mean people will
be mean to other people.

449
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,870
Nice people tend to not be
mean to other people. Right.

450
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,100
That's really real basic
stuff. Fundamental is for, um,

451
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,170
so you just keep reminding her.
So, uh, so I, I told her, hey,

452
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:13,590
look, if she doesn't want to be your
friend, then she's not your friend.

453
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,370
And that's okay. Does that
mean you'd be mentor? No,

454
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,520
but at the end of the day, she, I said,

455
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,830
are you stronger than her? And she said,
yeah. I said, are you smarter than her?

456
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,230
She said, yeah, I dunno. She
has or isn't. Here's the thing,

457
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,090
it's the self-empowering thing.

458
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:33,960
Just like how you said where she knows you
did sue. She's smarter, she's stronger,

459
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:36,480
she can do more pull ups, she can
do more burpees and stuff like that.

460
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,150
All this stuff. It starts to form in
her head. Hopefully move the goal. Yeah.

461
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:44,250
Hopefully it'll form in her head that
if they don't want to be my friend,

462
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,480
that's okay. That's no loss to me.
Maybe if someone who was strong like me,

463
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,010
smart like me and whatever, like
me, didn't want to say, well, okay,

464
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:56,970
maybe that's something, but this isn't the
case. You know? It's kind of that idea.

465
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:00,720
That's good advice. I think the, the thing
of just saying, oh yeah, that's okay.

466
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,210
Not everyone's gonna want to be
your friend. That's okay. Yeah.

467
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,340
And some people are going to like her
and some people aren't gonna like you.

468
00:28:05,341 --> 00:28:07,670
That's okay. You just be nice
to everyone. That's fine. Yeah.

469
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:11,430
I've got to ask that question.
When we did the one warrior kid podcast,

470
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,370
a bunch of people asked,
oh my,

471
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,250
I feel like people don't want to hang
around with me. And I was like, yeah,

472
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:19,740
that's okay. Yeah, that's okay.

473
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,720
You don't need to hang around
with people all the time. I don't,

474
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,730
I don't like even like
hanging around with people.

475
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,650
I didn't say that because I don't
want to turn it over her hands.

476
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,620
I social person like me.
But yeah,

477
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,400
that makes it in that thing or
I think you just said where,

478
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,670
cause my daughter always asks, you know,
did people not want to be your friend?

479
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,670
Or um, what'd she'd like? Bumped
her head real hard. She'd be like,

480
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,890
did you use to bump your head
when you were little? You know,

481
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:48,570
she always wants to know like, am I alone
in this whole, the whole deal and men,

482
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,610
it seems like you're
really helps what I say no,

483
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:53,910
I used to do all the time I show her
like my scars and stuff like that and

484
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:57,570
she'll be like, oh, and you can tell she
feels better about it. That's pretty cool.

485
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,960
It's weird. I think that would help
with a bullying thing and it's good.

486
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:05,400
Your daughter's smart and so she has the
capability of formulating that question.

487
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:08,820
I bet a lot of kids might
not be able to even say, hey,

488
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:11,240
did you bump your head too?
Whereas a parent,

489
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:15,150
if you just recognize that they probably
feel alone. And so if you say, Oh,

490
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:17,370
I know you bumped your head, I used
to bump my head too one time. Look,

491
00:29:17,371 --> 00:29:18,990
I got a scar on my head.
It happened to me too.

492
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:23,880
So they don't make your kids
beg for a partner in the world.

493
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,570
Give it to them. Yeah. Follow the
Echo Charles model of parenting.

494
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,470
And that makes sense too now
that I'm thinking of, because
even as an adult, okay,

495
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,070
so you got a kid and they're
like, hey, did you, I don't know,

496
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,010
did you bump your head like this and
get blood on your head or whatever when

497
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:41,290
you're little and you're like, you're
like, yeah, and if you add this,

498
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,070
and this is how I

499
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,720
dealt with it, right? Because
a lot of times like you
give him a little path. Yes,

500
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,070
exactly. Right. So you go,

501
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:51,940
you know you got this poor little kid
bumped her head and it's like, Dang,

502
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:53,940
I don't even know. I've never felt
this before. There's a lot of paint.

503
00:29:53,941 --> 00:29:57,250
There was blood. Oh, that's scary. I don't
know really how to deal with it. Right.

504
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,840
So of course you go to your dad and
then your dad's like, yeah, Hey, yeah,

505
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,440
I've done it. This is how I did it. This
is how I dealt with it. And she's like,

506
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:09,010
okay, maybe I can deal with that. And
even adult because adults, we do that too.

507
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,290
You know, like Dang, I'm getting,
I don't know, audited. Yeah.

508
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,630
Getting audited the first time,
whatever Jocko, hey you know,

509
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,070
or you know your friend or
whatever. It's like, hey,

510
00:30:18,071 --> 00:30:21,780
I got audited and this way you can back
to this is like how you deal with it and

511
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,571
all this stuff.
Boom.

512
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:26,280
You feel better about it indeed and
more empowered and that's on top of the

513
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,123
Jujitsu.

514
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,800
If I got audited I would way rather
know Jujitsu that not by the way here.

515
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,950
Yeah. Chuck, next question. Okay.

516
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,410
I've got a leadership
situation I need help with.

517
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:42,150
I was promoted to a troop commander
position over a fellow team leader who now

518
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:46,680
reports to me. He has many
years of experience in a
lot of knowledge. He's very,

519
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,600
he's very bitter and not getting the
promotion at not getting the promotion and

520
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:55,860
it's letting me know when I include them
in decision making for the troop or try

521
00:30:55,861 --> 00:30:59,250
to tap into his knowledge and
experience. He, he shuts down,

522
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,040
refuses to give input and says that
I should already have the answers.

523
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:05,310
Since I'm the troop commander,

524
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,300
I know the truth would benefit from his
input in team dynamics would be much

525
00:31:12,301 --> 00:31:17,280
improved if it wasn't so negative.
I've tried to let him know that I value,

526
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,170
I value his experience.

527
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:23,280
I feel that his input would be beneficial
and that his negative attitude and

528
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,220
bearing and bearing are not acceptable,

529
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,040
is making very ineffective team leader.
I'm,

530
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,720
I'm failing at getting through
to him and I don't want, fuck,

531
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,210
I don't want to fire him for his position.

532
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,160
How can it get him to value
his own position in the
troop and become effective?

533
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,400
Okay,

534
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,690
I actually think you're doing the right
thing and you've opened the door for him.

535
00:31:46,691 --> 00:31:50,170
So I think that's a good
first initial approach. Uh,

536
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,180
but obviously it doesn't
seem to be working.

537
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,060
Now a couple of different courses
of actions you could take.

538
00:31:55,061 --> 00:31:57,460
One of the things you could do is actually
give them some higher responsibility,

539
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,640
right? Give Him, put his team in charge,
put him in charge the whole team.

540
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:05,230
Sometimes maybe he will step up and start
to lead and see that he's now able to

541
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,180
prove that you have a lot of
trust in him and all that stuff.

542
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,880
There's also a chance,
think about this.

543
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,690
There's also a chance that you might
be coming off as condescending to him.

544
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,820
So imagine this, hey go, I, I
value your experience. Oh No.

545
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,110
So right. You know, the troop would
really benefit from your input.

546
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:26,270
It's like you're treating them like it's
a key. He's a kid and he's getting that.

547
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,430
Those can come off as condescending.

548
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:30,070
So we have to put those a
little bit in check as well.

549
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,330
And I think those are a little
bit, you know, you put the,

550
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:35,230
put the person in charge,

551
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:40,231
you try that you've opened up to try and
get their input and get them involved.

552
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,940
But it's, it might be coming, it might
be coming across as condescending,

553
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,250
even if it's, even if you're doing it
now, even if you're just saying, hey man,

554
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,990
could really use your input on this thing,
it'd be great.

555
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,130
Even if you're doing it in like a cool way
in your mind, you might be hearing, oh,

556
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:56,450
I could really use your help. So even
if you're saying it in a perfect way,

557
00:32:56,451 --> 00:33:00,320
it still might be hitting his ears
in a different way. So I don't know.

558
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,950
At this point, I think when I would
do is I would maybe just back off,

559
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,780
I would just go forward,
uh,

560
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,450
treating him like one of the leaders
and expect him to perform as you expect

561
00:33:11,451 --> 00:33:13,430
your leaders to perform.
I think you've made the effort.

562
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:16,430
It didn't really work and now you have a
job to do and you got to get on with it.

563
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,650
There's also, um, you know,

564
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:25,660
the world doesn't revolve around
his pouting in his being native and,

565
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:31,040
and you, you can't let that
happen. Now on top of that,

566
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:32,780
this guy is a powder
and he's a negative guy.

567
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:35,510
That's probably the reason he
didn't get selected to be promoted.

568
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,740
What we talked about earlier,

569
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,970
the boss saw that he saw something along
the way where things didn't go his way

570
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:44,000
and he and he pouted and it was negative
and that's why he didn't get promoted.

571
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,850
Meanwhile, the guy that did get promoted
when things didn't go his way, he's like,

572
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:47,241
okay cool.

573
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:50,180
Well we'll drive on with what the new
plan is and that's why he got promoted.

574
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:56,120
So I would say, move on, do your job,

575
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,910
treat him like you would
treat one of your leaders.

576
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:03,790
I had be very careful that you don't
correct cause you hear me say like, okay,

577
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:06,410
I'm gonna treat him normal and now all of
a sudden you're treating him like crap.

578
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,550
Don't do that.

579
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,480
But treat him as firmly and as fairly
as you would any one of your subordinate

580
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,730
leaders. And we have to see
where it goes from there.

581
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,560
He may end up just not being
able to deal with this fact.

582
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:24,440
I mean there's, there's a reason
why some people get promoted in,

583
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:28,610
some people don't. And maybe he's one of
these people that can't humble himself,

584
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,210
which is one of our biggest fears in
somebody that's trying to be a leader is

585
00:34:32,211 --> 00:34:34,970
that they can't humble themselves.
And if that's what's going on,

586
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,010
he's going to have a long,
hard road.

587
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:41,270
And you know who's fault it is going to
be never his never going to be his fault.

588
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:45,020
It's everyone else's fault. And,
and that's, that'll be problematic.

589
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:50,810
Yes. Tough one right there. Yeah.

590
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:53,870
Because in his mind straight up that like,

591
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:58,790
you're condescending. You don't
deserve it. I deserve it. You know,

592
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,000
and now you're [inaudible] irrigates yeah,
he's already lacking humility.

593
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,900
Was this one time in football,

594
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
in junior varsity football and
we're suiting up to play game.

595
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:17,300
Right. And my bra jade, he
was, he's really good. So he,

596
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,090
you know, you know how you have that
one guy, especially junior varsity,

597
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:24,140
you have the one guy who
makes the majority of the
touchdowns. Jade was that guy.

598
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,560
So we're suiting up and one
of our team guys on the team,

599
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:34,730
he was, he was that guy right there.
He was, he wasn't, the thing is,

600
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:37,620
but he wasn't very value. He wasn't
very athletic. You, you know,

601
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,490
um, and they kind of played the same
position. Judas Rhinebeck, back,

602
00:35:41,491 --> 00:35:43,670
he was a running back to, I think this
goes a full back though. I don't know.

603
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:48,600
I forget. Um, anyways, so he
goes, he goes to jail. Well,
time to show off again. Yeah.

604
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,960
Holy Cow. So you imagine
the mindset, it's the same.

605
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,670
That guy probably has the same
kind of mindset. Absolutely.

606
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,450
So it's like, man, it's like you can't,
even if you are doing the right things,

607
00:35:59,451 --> 00:36:03,360
how you said, like saying everything all
cool in his ears, it sounds different.

608
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,050
It sounds different
showing off again. Yup. So,

609
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,350
so sometimes when someone isn't
going to hear your words correctly,

610
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,760
sometimes it's best not
to say it miss times,

611
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:17,730
just keep the mouth shut. And you
ever been in an argument with someone,

612
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,040
but you're completely
trying to deescalate it.

613
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,790
And every single thing you said is getting
taken the wrong way. Be Quiet. Listen,

614
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,690
nod your head anyway. You know
like you're, you're not gonna,

615
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:30,030
you're not going to convince someone,
you're not going to get through to them.

616
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,630
They're too emotional.
This guy's too negative and yeah,

617
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,070
everything you say is going to be heard
differently and not in a positive way.

618
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,520
Yeah, yeah. Currently called opportunity
cost of addressing it is just

619
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,683
next question.

620
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,090
I'm often given tasks on the fly whereas
many of my tasks are given as a result

621
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:56,091
of meetings these days and increasing
number are coming from emails or my

622
00:36:56,491 --> 00:36:58,620
manager or client asking
me to do something.

623
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:02,580
I find myself quite disorganized
when dealing with this.

624
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,690
I'm writing things down when I'm told,
but it's all over the place.

625
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,050
Postits notebook phone.
It's such a,

626
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,120
I don't have a solid method of
keeping track of these things.

627
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm guessing that a possible solution
is to write all these things down in the

628
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:19,830
same place, but I've also tried that
and didn't really make a difference.

629
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,700
I'd appreciate any input or advice
you have on how to record and track

630
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:26,580
objectives in a functional,
in a reliable manner.

631
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,590
As I'm subjected to a lot of
information each day, week, month,

632
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,570
I'm definitely overloaded to remember
it myself. Discipline equals freedom,

633
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,910
so yeah, a few things. First,

634
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,940
first of all definitely write the things
down in one place and it sounds like

635
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,800
since you're moving all the time or
you're going to meetings carrier,

636
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:51,830
just a nice little notebook with you and
write the things down as you get tasked

637
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:55,050
with them. Then on top of that you have
to have a master list of some kind,

638
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,440
either paper or digital.

639
00:37:58,441 --> 00:38:03,441
I'm going to probably recommend digital
to track things overall in a prioritized

640
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:06,900
method. So if you get tasked something
in a meeting and your little notebook,

641
00:38:06,901 --> 00:38:10,980
you come back, you put it in the
right place in the master task list

642
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:13,680
and then

643
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:20,260
like twice a day to consolidate the
information that's in the little notebook

644
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:25,851
you have into the big master list and
then before you go to bed at night,

645
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,150
you organize those things by
priority on the master list.

646
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,090
Do you put the most important thing at
the top and that's what you're going to

647
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:34,380
attack the next day?

648
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,440
That's part one.
And how you get these things organized.

649
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,360
Now the part two is you
got to schedule this stuff,

650
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:44,800
and actually I always say this,
when people have trouble with tasks,

651
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,030
put them on the calendar.
You don't actually Jamie does that for me.

652
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,720
When Jamie's got something for me to do,
she just doesn't email me and say, hey,

653
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:55,690
you need to do this. And she puts it on
the calendar. So I look at my calendar,

654
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:59,020
boom, there it is. I got to go do
this. Whatever this task is done.

655
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:05,070
So put these things on your calendar and
that includes scheduling time on your

656
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:10,861
calendar so that you can have time to
consolidate your list and do a review of

657
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:11,734
your lists.

658
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,860
You know whether that takes that probably
take 15 minutes to do and I guess

659
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:21,160
there's a bunch of apps you can
use and I'm sure people will make

660
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:21,731
recommendations,

661
00:39:21,731 --> 00:39:26,170
but there's a ton of to do list
apps including there's one,

662
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,330
there's native ones on
all the different phones,

663
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,270
so you could look at that as
a possible of voice recorder.

664
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,500
You can either use the voice recorder
app you have or you can carry around a

665
00:39:35,501 --> 00:39:36,760
little mini voice recorder.

666
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,350
Then you can just take notes with that
and then you consolidate those notes from

667
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:42,184
your,

668
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:47,380
from Your Voice Recorder into
your master task list every day.

669
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:48,790
And then you just got to
prioritize and execute

670
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,380
to it pretty straight forward.

671
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,880
Write the stuff down and
put a little bump. I was,

672
00:39:56,881 --> 00:40:00,630
I was put little boxes in front
of everything. Do you understand?

673
00:40:00,631 --> 00:40:03,770
Like when I have a task I put a little box
so you can check. I can check it. Yeah.

674
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:09,180
Yeah, it makes bro. You're obviously
compared to me a master at that.

675
00:40:09,181 --> 00:40:11,970
Like all that is like, Dang,
you can do all that bro. I'm,

676
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:15,870
I'm on the flight just like this guy,
this person straight up,

677
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:18,970
like on the fly in new stuff comes up.
Same bold.

678
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,980
Be surprised at how much more you could
get done if you actually made a list of

679
00:40:22,981 --> 00:40:26,190
things you were supposed to
do. How's this? How's this?

680
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:29,960
I make lists and I still try and
turn and nail it down. Right.

681
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:36,180
I'll make a list. I even, okay, so I have
a book that Jamie gave me by the way,

682
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:42,750
a book a to do list book and then I help
you is trying to encourage good habits

683
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,450
and then I have my phone
and then I have this,

684
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:51,870
oh and then have just the regular thing
on the paper and then I do this thing

685
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:56,871
where I'll open word and have it on my
side screen and I'll put the list there

686
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,080
for the day.

687
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,790
It'll just be upstairs at their my face
and strangely that has proven to be the

688
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:04,890
best one because I'm doing,
I'm in here.

689
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:06,840
I see my mistake right now
that I'm telling you this,

690
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:10,440
I put it on on the book that Jamie
gave me, write my to do list.

691
00:41:10,441 --> 00:41:15,030
I put it there and then consolidate
your list. It's on that book.

692
00:41:15,031 --> 00:41:18,210
There's one on the, on the phone,
which is different now by the way,

693
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:20,530
your master list,
there's some apps

694
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,780
that may, so it doesn't matter
if you put it in your phone,

695
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:25,130
if you put it in your computer,
I mean obviously you've,

696
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,860
it's if it's on paper you need to
transpose it into digital format.

697
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:32,830
But there's, there's things that too.
Yeah, you need to consolidate a list here,

698
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,070
have master list of things

699
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,820
that you're trying to do and then I need
to attach myself as far as the routine

700
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:39,800
goes to look at that list.

701
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,600
You know all like that's why you
schedule it, which is what I just said.

702
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,250
That's why you put it on your schedule.
Hey,

703
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:49,970
every day when I sit down for lunch and
we would do a five minute review of my

704
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:51,380
lesson,
make sure I'm on track.

705
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:54,770
That gives you the afternoon to catch
up on anything you might've missed and

706
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,540
just get rid of my other list.

707
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,410
Cause half of it is me trying
different methods out there,

708
00:42:00,411 --> 00:42:03,270
right in the middle of carrying
out one other meth he at all.

709
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,780
So it's always a bad thing
about trying different,

710
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,570
trying to combine a bunch
of different methods,

711
00:42:08,571 --> 00:42:11,630
what you're doing when you do that as
you're looking for the easiest way.

712
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:14,720
And I'll tell you the funniest,
clearest example of that.

713
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,440
When Dean first started fighting and he
was going through his various stages of

714
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:22,280
trying to figure out how to cut weight,

715
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:24,920
and he already cut weight cut
white in high school as a wrestler.

716
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,300
So he knew how to cut weight.

717
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:29,870
But what happened is people would come
along and say, hey, there's this trick.

718
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,000
I use that trick and there's this
trick and there's that trick.

719
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,590
And he would try these other all these
little tricks out and you would try them,

720
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,990
you know,
at the same time.

721
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,670
And that's exactly what you can guess
what you don't when you try all these

722
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:44,300
different,

723
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,610
because what you're really doing is
you're looking for that something that

724
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:50,330
sounds easy. Cool. Yep. I'll do that. It
was the, you know, for Dina was like, oh,

725
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:55,340
I'll go on the Epson salt bath
and the hot tub. And then it was,

726
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,301
oh,
you know,

727
00:42:56,301 --> 00:43:01,301
and I'll drink just distilled water for
x amount of days and it was all these,

728
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,920
which all of these things are viable,
right?

729
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,580
We know that there are viable options,
but there's,

730
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:11,330
you have to use them in conjunction
to have to be, you have to,

731
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:15,710
you can't just like pull the pull
whatever little piece you want and think

732
00:43:15,711 --> 00:43:17,780
you're going to be good to
go. No, you've got to do,

733
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,310
you've got to follow the system,

734
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,910
take one and go with it kind of thing
and what you're trying to do is you're

735
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:26,720
looking for things that sound the easiest
and that's what you're trying to do.

736
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,650
The easy path,
the easy path over here,

737
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,400
but meanwhile you've got three
different paths all effective.

738
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,450
Meanwhile you're jumping
from one path to the others.

739
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:41,540
That's exactly what I'm doing with my to
do lists. I would like for to do lists.

740
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,090
Okay. You needed to do list that says
consolidate all of your to do list.

741
00:43:46,091 --> 00:43:48,440
That's step number one.
Then I got to remember that.

742
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,970
That's the list that I'm checking.

743
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:52,390
Then I got to remember to check
it because you know how you,

744
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:55,760
cause you always have that to do
list in your brain. You always do.

745
00:43:55,761 --> 00:43:58,040
You know you're like, oh I've got that
thing. By the way it's on my mind.

746
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,160
One in my brain is real solid.
What?

747
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,000
Like the the the to do list in
my brain is really, really solid.

748
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:08,160
Like I know what I have to do.
The only the,

749
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,350
the things I have to write down are things
that are outside of this. Outside the,

750
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,710
the,
the parameters of daily situations.

751
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:18,920
Like let's say there's some
admin thing that only comes up.

752
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,040
Well if it comes out super
rarely I'll remember it.

753
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:26,470
But if it's an admin thing that
comes up once every quarter, yeah,

754
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,010
I probably won't remember that.
It's not,

755
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,050
it's not so far outside that I'll
remember and it's not in the routine so I

756
00:44:31,051 --> 00:44:31,980
don't remember it.
So I got to write

757
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,210
that thing now.
That's what's on my list.

758
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:36,900
So do you write down the list
that's in your head? On the, on the,

759
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:40,800
on the written list,
I'll write down the things that I know are

760
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,083
are

761
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:48,250
subject to being forgotten because
the other things I don't forget them.

762
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,170
Yeah, so you're just, I don't forget
the hard core like company. If I have a,

763
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:56,950
let's say I'm going on a trip of a con,
like if I'm going on a regular trip,

764
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,690
I'm going to go to company that I work
with and they're in Atlanta and I'm going

765
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:04,060
to fly out there for three days.
I don't even,

766
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:07,120
I don't even have to think about that.
Everything that I do is,

767
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:11,920
is the the work I'm doing, the prep I'm
doing, everything I do is this standard.

768
00:45:11,921 --> 00:45:13,300
It's a standard operating procedure.
Even that,

769
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,150
even the things I'm going to
bring with me, it's the same.

770
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,240
I went on a one day trip to Vegas
the other day, like in and out.

771
00:45:19,241 --> 00:45:23,140
I didn't even stay the night and I had
the same suitcase that I take when I go

772
00:45:23,141 --> 00:45:25,240
on a five day trip.
Like it doesn't matter to me.

773
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:28,480
I'm not changing any standard operating
procedures. I got there and they said,

774
00:45:28,481 --> 00:45:31,240
aren't you leaving today? I said, yeah.
He said, why did you bring a suitcase?

775
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,680
This is how I,
this is how I travel.

776
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,300
This is the standard
operating procedure for me.

777
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,450
I'm not deviating from it
whether I'm going for one day,

778
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:42,550
but like a nine hour trip to Vegas
or a five day trip to Atlanta.

779
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,850
Guess what? It doesn't matter.
I'm carrying the same thing
cause that's what I do.

780
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:50,080
So if it's something like that, I
don't need to, don't even need things.

781
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,200
Some things don't make my list because
they're already in my head of my list in

782
00:45:53,201 --> 00:45:54,034
my head is solid.

783
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:57,580
It's things that are outside the bounds
of the standard operating procedures.

784
00:45:57,581 --> 00:46:01,000
Those are things that'll make the list
and that makes sense for this question.

785
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,860
It's kind of this question cause
he's getting stuff on the fly.

786
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:06,580
It's getting stuff on the fly. He's got
a piece, got write this stuff down. Yeah.

787
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:07,601
I think,
yeah,

788
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:10,000
I think we're all kind of the same way
in that way where you're going to have

789
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,560
one,
two,

790
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,280
maybe three things on your mind that no
way I'm going to forget this, you know,

791
00:46:15,281 --> 00:46:18,190
kind of thing. But man,
those lists though,

792
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,620
you get to really to choose one path
and stick with it and then remember it.

793
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,630
That's the thing. I think
that's my problem. I know that.

794
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,813
Next question.

795
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,740
How did you deal with losses in Jujitsu,
Jujitsu day today?

796
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,640
Losses look assuming in a tournament,
right?

797
00:46:40,641 --> 00:46:45,040
I just had my first tournament and
got the floor wiped with me. Yeah.

798
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,970
Welcome to Jujitsu. The obvious
thing is you got beat. Good.

799
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,120
You learned, I think we may wave
wedding, we've gone through that one.

800
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,560
And then really, you know, how did you
get beat? What areas where you're weak in?

801
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:02,570
Then you analyze and improve in
those areas. And that's Jujitsu,

802
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,090
right?
Don't dwell in in,

803
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,190
don't dwell in your loss,
but learn from it and move forward.

804
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:14,210
And actually speaking of Dave Burke,

805
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:20,020
I was talking to Dave Burke
and he was explaining to me

806
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,510
his psychological current
status in Jujitsu. So He's,

807
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,820
however he's, he's basically my age. I'm
40 might be 45 or something like that.

808
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,620
But he's been

809
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,130
basically a master of kind
of everything he's done.

810
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,120
And you know what I mean? I
mean, he's like, like factually,

811
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,880
if you look at his life,

812
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,410
he's been top gun top gun instructor.

813
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,750
He was telling me that during
Operation Southern Watch,

814
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,570
which was pre you know,

815
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,610
post first Gulf War
pre nine 11 he was the,

816
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:06,820
he was one of the very,
very,

817
00:48:06,821 --> 00:48:10,450
very few guys that actually
dropped a live bomb.

818
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,620
And you know, back in the day
when no one had any experience,

819
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:18,640
he was a guy that had really,
really done it and,

820
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,570
and then he was talking on top gun
instructor it, you know, you're just,

821
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,600
and then after 35 f 22 just all that
stuff that he's done and he was,

822
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:31,150
he was telling me that
like if he thinks about it,

823
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,800
he gets a little bit bummed out because
he's just starting Jujitsu right now.

824
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,670
Obviously it's in his head
and he's thinking, oh,

825
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:43,740
I'm never going to reach the highest
level that I should or could if I had

826
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:49,070
started younger. And so he, if he,

827
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,910
it's almost like if he thinks about that
too much, it's almost like all that,

828
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:54,030
I'm just not going to do it. You
know what I mean? But depending,

829
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:55,300
he immediately was like,

830
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,990
of course I know that I'm going to do
it and I'm going to be as good as I can.

831
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,460
But
you know that that's,

832
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,380
that's also the way life is.
Right? Just like when you,

833
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,380
how do you deal with losing in life? You
learn from your mistakes, you move on,

834
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:15,850
you don't, well, it's the same thing as
you did to, you study your weaknesses,

835
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:18,580
you figure out what you can do, you
fix those problems, you move forward.

836
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,510
Don't dwell on it

837
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,400
fast. That's it. Yeah.
Got Beat. Good. Yeah.

838
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,150
Actually put it into perspective
even more. We're okay.

839
00:49:28,151 --> 00:49:32,170
So this is just an assumption.
I know I just had my first tournament.

840
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm assuming white belt, maybe blue
belt. Okay. I'm assuming. Yup. You know,

841
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:40,260
it just doesn't seem like
at Brown belt or something,

842
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:44,680
you just turn this question or you're
not in your first tournament typically.

843
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,090
But I mean you never know,

844
00:49:46,091 --> 00:49:48,370
but you wouldn't even have this
in your mind where it's like,

845
00:49:48,371 --> 00:49:51,520
how do you deal with loss? You, you won't
have that in your mind as a brown belt.

846
00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:53,710
Like, you know, it's a
little bit more clear anyway,

847
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:59,380
so unless you,
this is like scarred you for life.

848
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,630
I lost and I'll never compete
ever again kind of thing. Um,

849
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,990
I think this is, this is a good way
to think of it where, you know how

850
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,181
it's like,

851
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:13,780
I dunno your first girlfriend and like
junior high or something dumped you. Like,

852
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:16,810
at the time it seems like,
Dang, I got dumped or whatever.

853
00:50:16,811 --> 00:50:19,770
And then when you're an adult you're
like, oh my gosh, same thing, Jujitsu.

854
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:22,740
So like when you're a white belt
and you lost your fridge, you know,

855
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:27,380
as a white belt and you're, you know,
I dunno, a blue belt, pro, belt belt,

856
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:30,050
black belt, whatever. And you're thinking
about your first tournament. You're like,

857
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:32,450
oh my gosh, who cares?
It doesn't matter at all.

858
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:35,430
And really when you kind
of put into perspective,

859
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,430
unless you want to dedicate
your life to competing,

860
00:50:37,890 --> 00:50:40,790
the tournament's don't really
mean anything. It's just fun.

861
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:44,770
And if you take the fun out of it by
putting everything on that one tournament

862
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:47,060
that you're currently doing, probably
you won't, won't want to do it.

863
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:51,500
And you'll kind of think that that's kind
of what competing is about. It's not.

864
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,490
So if you're,
if you lose your first tournament,

865
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,700
my first match and my first tournament,
I lost.

866
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,560
I didn't get the floor wiped with me,
but I, that's a common thing. Yeah.

867
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,050
You think back on it. And
not only do you, well,

868
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:09,860
I think you'll always remember the
first one, but, um, as far as like,

869
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,520
whether you want or lost,
it doesn't matter at all.
Totally doesn't matter at all.

870
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,730
And you'll find that the more you compete,
the less it'll matter.

871
00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:19,100
And then do you get to competition?
Really?

872
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:24,101
Unless you're like really dedicating
your life to being a good competitor.

873
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,820
Um, Jujitsu competitions, you're gonna
win some and you're going to learn.

874
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,800
You do some yes. And you
learn. And Learn, oh my gosh,

875
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:36,230
that doesn't work if I don't
time it correctly, or Dang,

876
00:51:36,231 --> 00:51:39,020
that doesn't work because
that's not a real submission.

877
00:51:39,021 --> 00:51:42,410
I only do it to smaller guys and they
tapped because it's uncomfortable kind of

878
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:44,990
thing. But in [inaudible] it doesn't, you
learn these kinds of things, you know,

879
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,960
but it's not even gonna matter.
Like dealing with the loss.

880
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:51,020
It's not even going to be a factor because
you just got to know that's just part

881
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:55,160
of it. And really, who cares when you're
kind of just starting out. You know,

882
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,020
like if you ask

883
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,340
like a top level black belt competitor,
you know, did you win? Ask coiler. Okay.

884
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,430
Coiler right.

885
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:09,850
He tells the story about him in her hoists
and went into their first competition

886
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,830
there. Dad said, if you win,

887
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:19,310
I'll give you 10 bucks.
If you lose,

888
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,090
I'll give you 20 so it
takes the pressure off.

889
00:52:23,091 --> 00:52:26,360
Like it's not that big of a deal. You
know, if you lose, boom, you know,

890
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:31,340
it's all good. That's what that was for.
And heuler loss hoist one boiler loss.

891
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,710
He got the 20 bucks and he's
like, sure I would've, you know,

892
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:37,790
had heuler one of the greatest
legendary guys lost his first one,

893
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,770
puts it in perspective.

894
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:45,370
It doesn't matter at all and got $200
you're not always going to get the 20

895
00:52:45,801 --> 00:52:50,030
bucks, but just say it, I'm, yeah,
it doesn't matter. It won't matter.

896
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,740
And you're going to think the
same thing like high school,

897
00:52:51,741 --> 00:52:53,750
like the stuff that happened in
high school. When it happens,

898
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:56,650
it seems like it's a big deal, but then
when you're an adult you're like, ah,

899
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:01,640
this is an adult. Cool. It's
a cool memory, but you know,
could have been better.

900
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,470
Anyway, next question. Hello, Mr Willing.

901
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:10,280
I'm currently deployed to Iraq
as an east six in the army.

902
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,860
I have listened to your podcast
and really enjoy your stuff.

903
00:53:12,861 --> 00:53:14,480
Especially different
discipline equals freedom.

904
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,450
I know as a sergeant and as a leader,
your focus isn't to be liked.

905
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,680
However your soldiers should respect you,

906
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:26,040
respect both you and your rank.
My question is how

907
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,470
do you tell your soldiers
to do the small stuff?

908
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,060
Tedious stuff like taking out
the trash and still be like,

909
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:39,030
all right, well first of all, if
we want to get respect from people,

910
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:42,000
we have to give them respect for sure.
Thinking about this,

911
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:45,630
think if you took out the trash
sometime you don't think if you're the,

912
00:53:45,631 --> 00:53:46,141
you're the boss,

913
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:49,020
but you see that the trash is getting
overfilled and you just grab it and take

914
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,170
it out.
Yeah.

915
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:53,520
There's thinking about what that does
is thinking about what that does,

916
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,990
the attitude of the guys,
if you took out the trash,

917
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:02,400
you, you maybe in your mind, do
you think you'd be losing respect,

918
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:07,050
but you actually wouldn't be at all. In
fact, everyone looks at you and goes, oh,

919
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:09,360
he's a good guy.
He's taking out the trash.

920
00:54:09,361 --> 00:54:14,100
It was little full then he's taken care
of it. So maybe if you're insecure,

921
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,150
you'd think you'd lose respect.

922
00:54:15,151 --> 00:54:20,070
But I think if you're secure in your
ability to lead and if you know that doing

923
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,130
some tedious stuff is going to
make you guys appreciate you

924
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:29,230
than to me that means it's
kind of worth it. Right. Um,

925
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,320
another example, you know, we
talked about taking out the trash,

926
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:34,470
but like what if the platoon
space has to be cleaned?

927
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,010
And on Friday you, you just say, hey
guys, you guys can go ahead and roll out.

928
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,720
I got this right. There's a
chance. They're like, hey boss,

929
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:50,500
we're not leaving.
Where are we know will help you there.

930
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,220
There's of course there's a chance they'd
be like, oh, that's awesome. Thanks boss.

931
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,730
And they bail
over time.

932
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,630
That might be if they don't respect
you at all, they might bail.

933
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,500
Now in order to regain the respect, do
you make them stay in Boston around more?

934
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,660
Does that increase the respect for you?
You see, you see how interesting it is,

935
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,340
is that if you go, hey guys,
that's cool, I'll do it.

936
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,010
And you're working hard and you still
got to maintain the discipline and you

937
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,610
don't take any slack. But at
the, it's the same balance.

938
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:27,420
It's the balance we talk
about all the time. So

939
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:33,990
the more that you treat
them with respect to more,

940
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:38,670
they're gonna respect you and they're
going to know that you're not,

941
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,300
you know, too high and mighty. Yeah.

942
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,300
They're going to know that you're down
to earth. When I was a platoon commander,

943
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:49,080
tasking to commander, I picked up brass,
I cleaned the ranges with the boys.

944
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:54,240
That's just the way I operated. And I
would recommend that kind of attitude.

945
00:55:54,241 --> 00:55:55,470
It didn't make people think,
oh,

946
00:55:55,471 --> 00:55:58,980
Jockos doesn't have anything better to
do that actually knew I had stuff to do.

947
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:03,090
But what am I going to do?
Pick up brass with the boys.

948
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:07,230
Build the relationships, set the example
they're gonna respect you for it.

949
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,810
Makes Sense. At the end of the day, do
you have something better to do? Right?

950
00:56:12,811 --> 00:56:15,780
Cause the whole, in the big picture, it's
like how you say like that's a leader.

951
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,550
Sometimes you literally have
something literally been no, no.

952
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:24,250
Like sometimes you literally pay,
the boys were up brass and guess what?

953
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:27,430
You got a meeting with the commanding
officer, you gotta go, do you? You know,

954
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:29,230
sometimes we,
you actually do.

955
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,670
And what's cool is tactically is,

956
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:36,790
and you heard us say this at
the, uh, FTX and were up in Utah,

957
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,120
if you see the leader doing something
menial, what you should do as a sub,

958
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:46,090
as a follower, step up and say, hey,
echo, I got this. You can go and lead.

959
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,080
That's what, that's what you want.
That's what I want to do for my leader.

960
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:54,040
I want to take things off my leader's
plate as much as possible. Now

961
00:56:55,570 --> 00:57:00,250
the more you try and you just
have to build those relationships,

962
00:57:00,251 --> 00:57:02,440
the way we build those,
if you don't have anything better to do,

963
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,020
then you get down there and do
you help you help clean up the,

964
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:08,080
do you help pick up the brass?
Yeah. That's the way it is.

965
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,640
Notice that about you and Lafe too,
where you know,

966
00:57:13,641 --> 00:57:15,770
like I'll have my camera
equipment and you know,

967
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,680
lights or whatever and it's not
a bunch of stuff, but you know,

968
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:20,050
you're always like,
oh,

969
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:24,110
you'll like grab something and you
don't like it when I grab your camera.

970
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,220
Don't touch it, don't touch it.
But, and when it's just me and you,

971
00:57:28,221 --> 00:57:30,620
it's kind of like cool cause we're
just kind of friends or whatever.

972
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:35,510
There's no perceived or no
like hierarchy kind of thing.

973
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:38,690
Like you're, you know, but let's
say like at the muster, whatever,

974
00:57:38,691 --> 00:57:42,920
it's obvious like you guys have a specific
job. I have a specific job, you know,

975
00:57:42,921 --> 00:57:46,970
kind of thing. And meanwhile
you and, and life will,

976
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,830
like if I'm around,

977
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,380
I'm carrying something that you'll always
like grab something or, or say, hey,

978
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:55,160
you need, you know, you didn't
though at the Utah thing,
he's like, oh, are you good?

979
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:57,650
I'm like, Bro, you're the
instructor here kind of thing.

980
00:57:57,651 --> 00:58:00,650
That's what I'm thinking in
my head. And um, and yeah,

981
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:04,130
you guys always offered to
like help. Really? Interesting.

982
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,440
I'm like almost offended.
Like Bro,

983
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,310
like do I look like I need help because
you shouldn't really be asking me,

984
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:09,530
you mean for

985
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,180
apple?
But there were bright,

986
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,920
very capable individual. Yeah. And

987
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:18,830
the small tedious stuff.

988
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:21,840
And the other thing is you explained
to why it's important, right? Yeah.

989
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:24,800
About to answer. We give all
the time. Why is it important?

990
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:27,290
Why is it important that the
platoon huts clean? Well,

991
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:30,440
cause I want you guys to have time off
over the weekends and not be stuck here

992
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,040
cleaning.

993
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:33,860
Cause the commanding officer came in
and saw that this place look like a hell

994
00:58:33,861 --> 00:58:36,230
hole. Okay, well that makes sense to us.

995
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:40,490
We understand why you want us to clean
now you want us to clean so that we can

996
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:43,920
have time off. You want us to
clean or you want us to train hard?

997
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:44,571
Do you want us to do this?

998
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:47,420
Cause cause we want to be ready for combat
because I want you guys to be able to

999
00:58:47,421 --> 00:58:48,470
come home to your families.

1000
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,370
Make sure they understand why
they're doing what they're doing.

1001
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,570
And if there's no reason why, if
the reason, I mean even cleaning,

1002
00:58:56,571 --> 00:58:58,820
even taking out the trash,
there's a reason for that. Right?

1003
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,060
There's an actual reason for that.
We can't just have junk everywhere.

1004
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:09,160
So explain why participate when you
can build the relationships with your

1005
00:59:10,671 --> 00:59:15,500
troops, you'll be good.
Yeah, that works by the way.

1006
00:59:15,501 --> 00:59:16,970
Thanks for your service and brother,

1007
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,420
I hope you're having a good time
over in Iraq, getting after it.

1008
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:22,430
Second that for sure

1009
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,590
that works for kids big time
explaining why you do it.

1010
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:30,470
And if you really want to dial in,

1011
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:35,471
the effectiveness is make that reason
somehow tie it to their interests,

1012
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:40,760
their direct interest. Cause sometimes
kids can't see the big picture. You know,

1013
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,980
like if I say you got to
clean your room and you know,

1014
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:47,840
otherwise your room be messy
and then maybe you know, um,

1015
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:52,520
later in life you might be
comfortable with a messy room,

1016
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:55,520
might get in the way of your effectiveness
at a little four or five year olds.

1017
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,140
They're not gonna understand
that. And they'll be like, cool,

1018
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,280
that sounds like terrible,
but they won't feel it.

1019
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:05,140
But if you tie it into their like direct
interest as a four or five year old or

1020
01:00:05,271 --> 01:00:08,680
however old the kid is,
it works really

1021
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:09,350
good.

1022
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,200
What if you don't clean your room and
there's a fire and I come in here to get

1023
01:00:12,201 --> 01:00:14,690
you,
but I trip and fall down and then you die.

1024
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:19,010
That's one way.
Yeah.

1025
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,840
Yeah, for sure. All right. Yeah. I don't
know if I'd say that, but it's cool.

1026
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,510
Good time for one more
here. Yeah, I think so.

1027
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,820
Jocko. In war, the enemy is clear,

1028
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,830
but in life,
in business,

1029
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,270
not so easy to identify any tips?

1030
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:45,420
Well,
um,

1031
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,470
I mean, first of all, that
is not a true statement.

1032
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:54,530
And in, in war, the enemy is
not always clear, not at all.

1033
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,310
The enemy,
the enemy can be hard to identify,

1034
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,800
very hard to identify the enemy's gonna
use camouflage to conceal themselves.

1035
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:07,670
They're going to use deception to,

1036
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,740
to distract your attention.

1037
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,030
They're going to blend in with
the friendly civilian populace,

1038
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,360
and they're going to take advantage
of your benevolence, right?

1039
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:19,153
In fact,

1040
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:24,250
the enemy is going to do absolutely
everything in its power to obscure their

1041
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:27,950
position,
to hide their purpose,

1042
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:31,430
to even mask their identity.

1043
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,830
So it is not easy to identify the enemy

1044
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,190
in combat in war.

1045
01:01:40,310 --> 01:01:44,960
So what you have to do is you have to
control what you can control, right?

1046
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,750
You gotta be prepared. You've got
to train, you've got to study,

1047
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,540
you've got to rehearse.
You've got to remain vigilant.

1048
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:57,570
You've got to maintain discipline in
everything you do so that when the enemy

1049
01:01:57,851 --> 01:01:59,320
does reveal itself,

1050
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:04,360
you have the ability to out think it,

1051
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,980
to out maneuver,
to fight the enemy.

1052
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:14,650
And it's actually the same
thing in business, right?

1053
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:16,150
The enemy can be hard to identify.

1054
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:21,030
Your competitors aren't
broadcasting their next move,

1055
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:23,050
okay?

1056
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,670
You don't know what the
market's going to do.

1057
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:28,060
You can't be certain about the next
trend or the next down turn to the next

1058
01:02:28,061 --> 01:02:31,270
bubble that's gonna burst.
You can't know those things.

1059
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:35,380
So you have to do the same thing.
You have to control what you can control,

1060
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,460
which is you

1061
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:43,140
gathering intelligence. You've got to
analyze the metrics that you can track.

1062
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:48,141
You got to train yourself and your team
to be prepared for both the known and

1063
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:50,310
also be prepared for the unknown.

1064
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,540
Figure out what the
likely contingencies are.

1065
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,410
Then have some plans

1066
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,950
to execute if those contingencies occur.

1067
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,160
Maintain discipline as an organization
so that you have the flexibility and the

1068
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:13,870
responsiveness to maneuver effectively
and efficiently when the unpredictable

1069
01:03:13,871 --> 01:03:15,280
actually happens.

1070
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:19,540
So instead of suffering and
falling apart in the chaos,

1071
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,330
you can take advantage of it and when

1072
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:26,963
and

1073
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:30,600
that's business and life is the same.

1074
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,360
The enemy is not always clear in life.

1075
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:36,270
It can be hard to tell who's
going to try and bring you now

1076
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,620
or what is going to bring you down.
There's distractions.

1077
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,230
There are things out there
that will do you harm,

1078
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:51,730
that are so camouflaged.
You can't see them at all.

1079
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,100
There are deceitful people.

1080
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:03,510
There are accidents that can occur and
diseases that take root and there's bad

1081
01:04:04,601 --> 01:04:05,021
luck.

1082
01:04:05,021 --> 01:04:10,021
And there's Murphy's law and there's times
when it seems that the whole world is

1083
01:04:11,111 --> 01:04:14,110
against you.
The whole world

1084
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,413
is the enemy

1085
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,130
and the same rules apply.

1086
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:28,510
Control what you can't control.
You train hard,

1087
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:29,373
learn,

1088
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:34,380
maintain the unmitigated daily
discipline in all things.

1089
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,660
Train hard physically and mentally.

1090
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:46,661
Push yourself so hard that you become
accustomed to the stress you get used to

1091
01:04:47,181 --> 01:04:48,014
it

1092
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:52,210
every day.

1093
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:58,380
Make yourself stronger and faster and
smarter and better so that when the enemy

1094
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:05,671
does finally climb out of the
shadows and expose himself to you,

1095
01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:11,640
you are ready.
You are waiting

1096
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,830
and you can relish in the tunity

1097
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:23,010
to attack and fight an orderly
decimate and destroy him.

1098
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:29,373
Okay.

1099
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,610
And I think

1100
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:36,010
that's all I've got for tonight.
So

1101
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,810
Echo,
maybe you could,

1102
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,880
okay.

1103
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,880
Help us figure out how we can support
ourselves and perhaps be better prepared

1104
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,650
for the enemy yeah.

1105
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:59,040
Of whichever kind and whenever it
exposes itself so that we can smash it.

1106
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,430
And if you want to do that,

1107
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:08,290
you can also do that while
simultaneously supporting this podcast.

1108
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,930
They want to of course, or we could just
have a bunch of advertisers on here,

1109
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:18,490
listen to us talk about
stuff that, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1110
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:23,140
Either way. Hey, I'm here to do
one of the things I was talking to.

1111
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:26,650
Uh, actually that's, that's
true. That where, you know how,

1112
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:31,240
you know, you say that a lot and it's
easy, especially me. I go, what do I say?

1113
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:35,450
A lot like, be ready, you know?
Yeah. You know, um, you know,

1114
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,900
prepare you stronger, faster, smarter,

1115
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:41,570
and you don't like a lot of things
after a while, you hear it like enough.

1116
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:45,610
A lot of times, a lot of times, a
lot of times, sometimes it clicks,

1117
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:50,530
but then every once in a while you'll,
it'll like leave a mark. No, no, no, no.

1118
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:55,510
The opposite. Sorry. The
opposite. Like, um, okay. You
know? Yeah, I get it. I get it,

1119
01:06:55,570 --> 01:06:58,000
I get it, I get it. And Blah Blah,
blah, blah. The next kind of, yeah.

1120
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,880
And these things, like when you
really think about that one, like we,

1121
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:05,050
there was a saying, I don't
know, I'm sure it's not new.

1122
01:07:05,051 --> 01:07:08,170
When I heard it was like
chance favors the prepared man.

1123
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:11,230
Is that the correct fortune?
Favors the brave.

1124
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:13,080
Yeah.

1125
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,050
Wait, wait, what are
you looking for? That,

1126
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:18,260
that quote is like basically some chance.
Favorite though.

1127
01:07:18,270 --> 01:07:21,510
The one that I heard it was chance
favors the prepared man. Yeah, for sure.

1128
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,730
So it's all,
it's all the same variations of that one.

1129
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,370
I went straight to the fortune
favors the bold or brave. Yeah.

1130
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,700
Prepared. Right. So if you're scared,

1131
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:36,820
you know you're going to seem to have
more luck with victory and all this other

1132
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:40,800
stuff. Right. So it's like,
you know, in any circumstance,

1133
01:07:40,801 --> 01:07:44,460
like if you take working out working
that as like the easy one because like if

1134
01:07:44,461 --> 01:07:45,690
you're in shape or you're,

1135
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,540
you're strong or if you're not weak
or if you're not incapable, you know,

1136
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:52,590
like you don't work out so your backs
out or something like that or compare it

1137
01:07:52,591 --> 01:07:53,520
with being strong,

1138
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:58,580
being strong is always more beneficial
in pretty much every single situation is

1139
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:03,120
them being weak. Yes. True. Or being
in shape, you know, being healthy,

1140
01:08:03,850 --> 01:08:08,040
being zero, order, being
smarter. Yeah. Yeah.

1141
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:09,880
You hesitated,
but that's,

1142
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,100
it's always good to be strong and
occasionally it's good gum. No,

1143
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:16,070
not saying there's not one of
the, it's, it's one of those

1144
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,060
things where where are,

1145
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:20,450
where the result of working out and
being strong is always going to add a

1146
01:08:20,451 --> 01:08:23,750
tangible benefit to most of this. Pretty
much everything you do in your life.

1147
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:28,120
That about being smarter. I'm not saying
that I'm not just going to jump into,

1148
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:31,530
yes, that's true too, because I didn't
think about it. I thought about this.

1149
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,560
Let's see. There you
go. Well, nonetheless.

1150
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:40,400
But I think that's one of
those things where we kind of,

1151
01:08:40,790 --> 01:08:44,030
it's my opinion that what
you just said there is,

1152
01:08:44,031 --> 01:08:48,910
should be taken to heart
hundred percent concur. Yeah.

1153
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,360
Not just some cool thing like let's face
it. That sounded good. That sounded cool.

1154
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:57,380
But in there I don't, I don't
listen to it cause I'm saying, yeah,

1155
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,340
I thought it sounded dope,
but it's absolutely true.

1156
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,800
And you know, and there's little
micro struggles, you know, in life.

1157
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:11,860
Let's face it. I know you have some
of my clothes, all my struggles or my,

1158
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,710
but guess what? No problem.
You know, no factor, no factor.

1159
01:09:18,770 --> 01:09:22,490
I was filling up jugs
and I used this example.

1160
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,890
I'm going to do it again.
You know why? Cause it's it,

1161
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:26,930
every time I fill up
jugs I think about this,

1162
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,940
the struggle is real water jugs.
They're like, well, 40 pounds, right?

1163
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:36,740
I think like seven pounds. I think it's
an eight pounds per gallon. Seven. Okay,

1164
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:41,540
so they're five gallons each.
Yeah. Okay. That's, you know,

1165
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:46,430
but no problem. You know, if can do it.
No, I don't need a cart. Take care of him.

1166
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,310
You know kind of thing.
Do you carry just one in each arm yelling,

1167
01:09:49,320 --> 01:09:52,640
any Chan it see what it is. See what
I'm saying? They'll see how you're like,

1168
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:54,080
that's nothing.
That's nothing.

1169
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,660
But for a lot of people who don't
work out and I was like that,

1170
01:09:56,661 --> 01:09:58,520
that's not nothing.
It's something

1171
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:05,450
nonetheless. I'm just saying
like if you're prepared. Okay,

1172
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:09,140
so tell us how we got bless
struggles. Yeah. Okay,

1173
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,690
so first thing you do is maintain,

1174
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:17,840
maintain your, your, what do you
call it? Your, your, your structure.

1175
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,870
Foundational structure.
Foundational structure.

1176
01:10:20,871 --> 01:10:24,680
Make sure you're not breaking down,
starting with your joints. As always,

1177
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:26,990
say chocolate has some supplements.

1178
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:31,970
Krill oil and glucosomine can
Drayton supplements, Jocko,

1179
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:34,040
Super Krill Krill oil

1180
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:41,120
and what's called joint warfare,
chocolate joint warfare.

1181
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:44,120
That's Glucosomine conjoint and some
other good stuff for your joints.

1182
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:44,751
It's funny.

1183
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:49,490
The other stuff is
actually really beneficial.

1184
01:10:49,491 --> 01:10:54,491
So go to origin main.com and read so
that you can realize the benefits that

1185
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:58,290
you're getting because it's good for you.
Yeah,

1186
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:02,120
and I'll go beyond just good for you.
It's the kind where,

1187
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:05,900
and I'm saying this firsthand,
firsthand account. My account

1188
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,880
before you take this,
you're going to have joint pain.

1189
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,000
And even if nonfactor joint pain,
I was talking to Dave Burke the other day,

1190
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,950
Dave Burke's popular tonight.
Yeah.

1191
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:23,370
So Dave Burke asked me about
Krill oil just in general.

1192
01:11:23,490 --> 01:11:25,050
He's like, well, I don't have joint pain.

1193
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:27,900
Like most of the workouts and
Martin workouts, they do see the,

1194
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,630
and that's the thing. So I was
like, I was kind of like that too,

1195
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,260
where I didn't know and I don't
want to be the guy who's like, no,

1196
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:36,930
you do have this problem. And they're
like, Bro, I don't have this run. No, no,

1197
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:40,120
you do and you need this product.
You know, I don't, I'm not,

1198
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:43,800
I didn't want to be that guy and you want
to come off like that guy. So I'm like,

1199
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,620
yeah, you'll save coming off
like that for the podcast.

1200
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,730
No,
he made a good point.

1201
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:57,150
If you don't have like joint
pain or whatever, um, then yeah,

1202
01:11:57,151 --> 01:12:00,440
you won't have the exact experience I
did because I did have joint pain and I

1203
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:05,130
joined p and in places that I didn't kind
of realize it. You just feel like, oh,

1204
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:08,250
don't Dang, I'm still
better. That's your baseline.

1205
01:12:08,251 --> 01:12:11,300
You get used to the pain on top of the
fact that it had pain that I didn't, I,

1206
01:12:11,301 --> 01:12:12,900
that I knew it wasn't normal,
you know,

1207
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:16,310
just more stiff now that I'm getting
older or whatever. But nonetheless,

1208
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:21,660
I was like, Dude, look an old
I think, how do I look cool?

1209
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:27,390
You know, it's my birthday in
two days, by the way. Anyway.

1210
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,390
Sure. You could not have
joint pain, but the,

1211
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:36,000
even before I had like any kind of
pain from working out or whatever,

1212
01:12:36,001 --> 01:12:39,270
from joint or in my joints or whatever,

1213
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:43,470
I should have started taking
it before that I should have.

1214
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:47,220
And I'm not saying people will take it
or what. I'm not saying that necessarily.

1215
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:52,350
Um, so Dave's question to me was,
should I start taking it? I said yes.

1216
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:54,240
Yeah, hundred percent. It's good advice,

1217
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:59,660
but I did have to let them know if you
legitimately or not having joint pain,

1218
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,300
don't think that it's going to be a
miracle thing. Like it felt like for me,

1219
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:10,530
that's the point. Nonetheless, it's the
best stuff because it's from Jocko, right?

1220
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:15,120
Yeah. Well it's the best stuff cause
it's the best stuff it happens to be,

1221
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:16,260
happens to be.
Anyway,

1222
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,320
go to origin main.com for this super
krill oil and Jocko joint warfare on the

1223
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:26,280
tops is labs. I always see that it's
on the front too, so it's real obvious.

1224
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:29,880
Just go there or [inaudible] dot com
there's also some geese if you're still

1225
01:13:29,910 --> 01:13:34,320
wondering about what gay to get.
Don't wonder anymore.

1226
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,260
Straight up. Yeah. And there's actually,

1227
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:39,980
there's actually no comparison
to be quite honest with you.

1228
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,220
There's no comparison.

1229
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:47,180
Every other g is not made here
in America with American hands.

1230
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,600
American material.
Yeah.

1231
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,320
So there's no compare. You can't
compare. Can you literally can't compare.

1232
01:13:55,321 --> 01:13:56,154
There's no comparison.

1233
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:01,140
And I don't want to turn this into like,
you know,

1234
01:14:02,430 --> 01:14:06,570
putting down any other geeky company.
So I'm not necessarily going to do that.

1235
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:09,150
But let's face it,

1236
01:14:09,151 --> 01:14:11,610
in certain manufacturing

1237
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:18,580
industries, I guess
brands, a lot of brands,

1238
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,290
they go,
they all go to the same stuff.

1239
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:26,140
Plier in Pakistan, they are aware of the
things come from the same place. Yeah.

1240
01:14:26,230 --> 01:14:28,570
And that's why I said there's
actually no comparison. Yeah.

1241
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:31,040
And it's not just no comparison
cause it's made in America.

1242
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:36,210
It's no comparison because it's been
designed from the ground up by people that

1243
01:14:37,611 --> 01:14:39,140
do Jujitsu.
Yes.

1244
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:44,120
By people that do Jujitsu on the
daily at origin, the factory.

1245
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,810
Then you know what the next building is,
the origin training facility.

1246
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:48,830
So it's like,

1247
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:52,170
it's like we're going to put on our gies
and train and then we're going to do,

1248
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:55,580
make sure that it's squared away
from, by the way, it's not like,

1249
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:58,820
oh well we want it to look like this
and we'll just have to use some random

1250
01:14:58,821 --> 01:15:02,630
material.
We'll design the material,

1251
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,840
design the weave of the material so
that it's optimum for Jujitsu and that's

1252
01:15:09,141 --> 01:15:12,140
what will make and sell. So
there is no comparison. Yeah.

1253
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:15,650
And he was like no one else doing
anything close to that. Yeah.

1254
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:19,280
The closest would be, hey
we're, we're making it. Look,

1255
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:23,300
we're putting a color to it or
putting a patch somewhere or you know,

1256
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:27,050
that's the closest you could do to say,
and we're doing something like this. Yeah.

1257
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:32,410
No one is designing from the ground up
from the material up from the threads

1258
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:36,670
themselves. Yeah. The typical scenario,
by the way, it's not just the geese,

1259
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,690
the rash guards, same thing. Yeah.

1260
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,520
The material created by origin.

1261
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:48,550
Yeah. Yeah. The typical scenario is
you get, you know, hey, I'm been to,

1262
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:49,600
and you'd be surprised man.

1263
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:54,700
Even these like kind of established
brands like it doesn't matter which ones,

1264
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:58,880
whatever. But there'll be like, hey, yeah,
let's do you know, let's make this g,

1265
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:01,870
oh by the way,
let's get the same blanks that we use.

1266
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:05,240
Is everybody always been getting and
that everyone else and let's just put a

1267
01:16:05,241 --> 01:16:08,340
cool stitch on there or
something or patch or,

1268
01:16:08,390 --> 01:16:11,300
or design doesn't just the
way it typically works.

1269
01:16:11,301 --> 01:16:13,160
Not even necessarily that
there's anything wrong with it.

1270
01:16:13,161 --> 01:16:17,860
Cause if you like you eat like your gay.
That's good. That's how I am. But yeah,

1271
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:21,350
the origin, once you kind of put
it on, I will argue that you're,

1272
01:16:21,351 --> 01:16:26,060
you're going to kind of understand my
opinion on the last or do you mean.com

1273
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,290
that's the one,
that's the good one.

1274
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:32,300
Also for legit fitness gear.

1275
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:36,230
Go to on it.com/jocko good
kettle bells on there.

1276
01:16:36,830 --> 01:16:39,650
They got some star wars Kettlewell's.

1277
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:43,880
That's cool. Yeah. See
that's the thing, man.

1278
01:16:43,881 --> 01:16:46,900
You don't really care that much about
these, these cool kettle bells. I do.

1279
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:51,320
Nice about it. I do. I think
they're dope nonetheless. Um, yeah,

1280
01:16:51,390 --> 01:16:55,250
kettlebells on there. I got into
kettlebells awhile ago. Very glad I did.

1281
01:16:55,251 --> 01:16:57,020
Wish I had done it earlier.

1282
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:02,700
Did I get you into kettlebells? Yeah, I
got you into Krill oil and kettlebells.

1283
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:03,090
Yeah.

1284
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:08,020
Okay. Give it up. But both. Yeah,
both. Not necessarily. Not actively.

1285
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,190
I got you in the metcons to make cons.
Yeah. You used to not do metcons.

1286
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,970
I remember you sent me a text
sometime like what was like,

1287
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:19,160
what's the deal with this, this
metabolic conditioning? He said,

1288
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:21,370
what should I do and I
just sent you in there.

1289
01:17:21,371 --> 01:17:25,640
All of a sudden you started doing metcons
and your cardio on the Mat got a lot

1290
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,550
better quick too,
by the way.

1291
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:33,130
Metcons metcons with
kettlebells and Krill oil. Ooh.

1292
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:35,510
That Combo right there.
Anyway,

1293
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,570
and there's a lot of cool other exercise
stuff on there like creek kind of

1294
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,990
create more creative stuff. Um, you
know, keep your workouts interesting.

1295
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,040
That is on at.com/chocolate checkout.
Some stuff on there.

1296
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:48,020
They got some really good stuff.
Really good stuff.

1297
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,430
I'd use [inaudible] smart with that where
he's always like pushing like the good

1298
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:56,330
stuff, you know. You know
also Jack was a store.

1299
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:00,920
It's called Jocko store.
Jacqueline's store.com. It has,

1300
01:18:01,250 --> 01:18:05,870
if you want to get these shirts that we
make and we have been to make their good

1301
01:18:05,871 --> 01:18:09,170
shirts do,
they're not like free shirts.

1302
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:12,140
You know the free ones that you
like. Cool. And you never wear it.

1303
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:15,410
It's not that kind of very wearable. I
made it a point to make. I'm like good.

1304
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:20,690
You know, it's the women's stuff
on their rash. Guards, patches,

1305
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:23,810
hoodies.
I know it's getting colder now.

1306
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,540
Places they're thicker.
Hoodies does it called Nicola?

1307
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:31,790
You right now it is actually.
It is.

1308
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:35,670
It's like 60 there's no other
topical. Why you right? No, not quite.

1309
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:40,120
It's a big island. Yeah. Dang
it. Monica. I just revealed my,

1310
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,080
not everyone knows Hawaiian. That's
all right, but you're coming to me.

1311
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:49,970
That's a man. I might have to suspend
your my co E-card for a little while.

1312
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:53,200
They'll have to now
anyway.

1313
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:57,740
We've got some hoodies for people who
are in places other than Hawaii or if

1314
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:01,430
you're on Mauna Kea, thicker
hoodies, all this stuff. Anyway,

1315
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:03,950
I'm not saying buy stuff.
I'm saying [inaudible] check it out.

1316
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,110
If you'd like something, get
something. It's a good way to support.

1317
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:10,370
Also subscribe to the podcast if you
haven't already on iTunes and stitcher and

1318
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:13,460
Google play. However you listen to the
podcast who's subscribed seems obvious.

1319
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:17,510
I know, but if you haven't
subscribed, good way to support.

1320
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,700
Also on Youtube we have a youtube channel.

1321
01:19:22,590 --> 01:19:25,580
There is various reasons
to subscribe to Youtube,

1322
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:29,480
but the main one I think main two is
if you'd like the video version of this

1323
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:34,130
podcast and you like little excerpts,

1324
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:38,870
whether we put some music behind
them. When I say we, I mean me,

1325
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:44,750
it's a music guy, them and
some various effects or not.

1326
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:45,760
There's excerpts,
you know,

1327
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:48,830
little shorter than the whole version
of the podcast and you can share him,

1328
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,630
listen to him or whatever. Let
quicker anyway, subscribe to Youtube.

1329
01:19:53,631 --> 01:19:56,990
This is what I'm saying, if you want,
and if you do want to and you do,

1330
01:19:56,991 --> 01:20:00,770
it's a good way to support
also psychological warfare.

1331
01:20:00,771 --> 01:20:01,670
If you didn't know what that is.

1332
01:20:01,671 --> 01:20:06,671
It's an album on iTunes
that you can get with tracks

1333
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:12,690
that on your campaign
against weakness on the path,

1334
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:16,830
trying to get in better shape.
You're trying to get in shape.

1335
01:20:17,910 --> 01:20:22,620
You want to maintain your sheet,
you want to what? Wake up earlier.

1336
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:26,400
And you covered it too. No, no, no, no.
These are the, I'm saying, you know,

1337
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:29,250
but here's the thing. It's
like, well it could cause, okay,

1338
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,270
so it seems obvious, right?
You're trying to get in shape.

1339
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,670
You're going to have hard days,
you know, days where you're like,

1340
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:39,330
I'm going to skip the workout.
Right? No, it seems obvious.

1341
01:20:39,331 --> 01:20:43,260
That's an element of life on the
path that's, it seems obvious.

1342
01:20:43,261 --> 01:20:47,880
You'll run into like points of weakness
that's obvious and I dig it and there's

1343
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:50,580
a track for that. Chocolate tells
you why you shouldn't do that.

1344
01:20:50,581 --> 01:20:55,410
You just listened to it.
Boom. Get it right back on
track. But I don't always do.

1345
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:59,190
What I don't always talk about is that
this tracks for other things like the

1346
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:00,090
creativity thing,

1347
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,800
like if you got like a procrastination
situation. How's Allen?

1348
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,660
The reason you're looking at me like
this is because you already know this,

1349
01:21:09,661 --> 01:21:11,070
but not everybody knows this.

1350
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:14,610
You're procrastinating me finishing
this podcast and no, no, no.

1351
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,640
We are finishing this podcast
strong with boatloads of value

1352
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,860
because I'm lazy. I'm letting
people know this is what it is.

1353
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:29,430
Say psychological warfare.
It's an album with tracks on iTunes,

1354
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:33,150
MP3, Google play, Amazon music.

1355
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,880
If you're going to run into some issues,

1356
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,320
it'll help you out and get into
those issues. Next topic. Yeah, Eh,

1357
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,000
I guess I could have said it like that.

1358
01:21:43,830 --> 01:21:46,770
That's more of like the Jocko way
to say it. You know, like I don't,

1359
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:51,200
I feel like if I come from a place of,
you know,

1360
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:56,040
authentic relation to the struggle,

1361
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:58,260
I feel like it'll,
it'll,

1362
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:02,460
it'll pass the message in a
more accurate way I think.

1363
01:22:03,060 --> 01:22:08,030
Okay. You don't skip
workouts. True. You do.

1364
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:09,750
You okay, here's this. How's this?

1365
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:14,250
Do you ever sit in your gym,

1366
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:18,840
sit on the bench or whatever,
or the bike and be like, man,

1367
01:22:18,841 --> 01:22:22,590
if I am make deals with
yourself. Hey, if I skip today,

1368
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:26,040
I'll just do a double.
I'll do is like,

1369
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:30,600
if I'm doing something that's going to
suck like squats. Yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll,

1370
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:36,210
I'll, I'll put, I'll procrastinate.
I'm in the gym like it's gonna happen.

1371
01:22:36,270 --> 01:22:39,940
Okay. But I'll like, okay,
let me just start talking.

1372
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:44,940
But it's, it's one of those things
like the outcome is known. Yeah. Yeah.

1373
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:48,150
The outcome is not in question.
The workout will happen.

1374
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:53,310
I'm just being a complete baby about it.
Okay. So then I just have to suck it up.

1375
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,750
Yeah.
So see,

1376
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:59,810
that's why you're looking at me like
that because me and a lot of people like

1377
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:04,470
me, we're not like that. We're trying to
be like that. We want to be like that.

1378
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,090
I know. I do. I want

1379
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,260
to be like skipping the
workout is straight up a non,

1380
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:13,870
not an option ever. I want to, I, that's
a total wine. I want to be like that.

1381
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:14,740
You won't let it happen,

1382
01:23:14,740 --> 01:23:17,830
but there are times and have been
times where I'm sitting there.

1383
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,700
There's been times I drove
to the gym before I got my
own show, drove to the gym,

1384
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:25,200
sad in there. It was like, look,

1385
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:29,950
if I just walk right out of here right
now, he's skipped this workout I need.

1386
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:34,150
I need Rick. I'm not going to get a
good workout anyway. Oh, you know what?

1387
01:23:34,180 --> 01:23:37,210
I'll just come back in on Saturday.
That was my active rest.

1388
01:23:37,211 --> 01:23:41,440
I'll come back in and I'll get it.
Then today will be my rest day. Right.

1389
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,010
I'm like that. Some other people
were like that. You're not like that.

1390
01:23:45,011 --> 01:23:47,770
That's why you don't understand.
You know what I'm doing right now with,

1391
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:52,080
I'm shuffling my papers, being passive
aggressive. I know it's very unlike you,

1392
01:23:52,270 --> 01:23:55,930
but you know, hey man, so good.
Nonetheless, psychological warfare.

1393
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:59,380
I'm trying to make the make disappointed.
This is a for real point.

1394
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:00,460
Okay.

1395
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:03,760
Valuable point is the track that Jocko.

1396
01:24:04,270 --> 01:24:04,630
Okay.

1397
01:24:04,630 --> 01:24:07,840
Hi Nick. Even though he tried to talk me
out of explaining this to you right now.

1398
01:24:08,430 --> 01:24:08,740
God,

1399
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:12,900
he will talk you out to out of effectively
talk you out of skipping the word,

1400
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:17,230
skipping the workout, talk you out
of pressing the snooze or whatever.

1401
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:19,840
All these little points of weakness
gone there. Just if you look at them,

1402
01:24:19,841 --> 01:24:23,230
you'll see all the little
points of weakness that you,
that these tracks address.

1403
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:26,530
It's good. Very effective. Cool.

1404
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:32,200
Are we done with that section? Very good
way to port podcasts too. All alright.

1405
01:24:32,201 --> 01:24:34,150
Jocko white tea.
You can get that on Amazon.

1406
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:38,380
It will guaranteed a hundred
percent double blind placebo,

1407
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:41,960
a placebo tested triple, triple blind. Uh,

1408
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:46,360
you can deadlift 8,000 lbs. So you
might want to pick that up on Amazon.

1409
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:49,570
You can read them. If you don't
believe me, that's fine. Go read the,

1410
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:54,600
go read the reviews on Amazon where every
verified purchase is like they're dead

1411
01:24:54,811 --> 01:24:58,990
lifting minimum 8,000 pounds. Books.
Got Some books way the warrior kid.

1412
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:01,990
If you have a kid or you know,
a kid did help a kid,

1413
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:03,920
okay.

1414
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:06,980
Help them be a better person
to have a better life.

1415
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,940
Get in the way of the warrior kid.
Extreme ownership.

1416
01:25:10,941 --> 01:25:15,080
The new edition is out and you all helped
write it because it has questions from

1417
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:19,970
this podcast. Also, the new
forward, also the color pictures,

1418
01:25:20,150 --> 01:25:21,920
lame didn't want them

1419
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:29,560
but made up for that by just making the
cover black because black and that book

1420
01:25:31,701 --> 01:25:34,160
has all the fundamental
principles of combat leadership.

1421
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:37,640
It's for you and your team
do you don't need to hide it.

1422
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:39,410
Remember in the beginning
people would want it,

1423
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,170
they'd get it and they'd want
to key up for themselves.

1424
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,820
They want to hide the knowledge because
they want to look. They want that.

1425
01:25:43,821 --> 01:25:47,900
Don't do that. It doesn't help. The more
people know it, the more people on board,

1426
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:52,340
the better it's going to work.
Also from an individual perspective,

1427
01:25:52,341 --> 01:25:54,050
to get yourself on the path,

1428
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:57,080
there's a book called discipline
equals freedom field manual.

1429
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,880
It's available everywhere.

1430
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:00,810
Okay,

1431
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:03,980
and you might be wondering
if it would make a good

1432
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,360
gift. Well, not only is it heavy,

1433
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:13,160
have you noticed how heavy it is?
It's a heavy book. It's a big book.

1434
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,020
It's a substantial book.

1435
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:20,320
It's completely unique because it has
black pages and the outside of the pages

1436
01:26:22,521 --> 01:26:24,980
are also black to work of art for sure.

1437
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,940
So get some copies for the people that
you know because beyond blue looking

1438
01:26:32,810 --> 01:26:37,760
really cool,
there is no better gift than discipline.

1439
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:44,390
So I get some copies and also
if you want the audio version,

1440
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,501
see now look,

1441
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:48,410
I'm doing the same thing you just did
but let's watch how long this takes.

1442
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,710
If you want the audio version of
discipline equals freedom field manual,

1443
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,990
you can get it on iTunes,
Amazon music,

1444
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,310
Google play and other MP3
platforms period. Right there.

1445
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:03,430
Now everyone knows what you took 15
minutes to explain if you were in further

1446
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:09,110
need of more fire support in
terms of basic leadership.

1447
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:11,450
Okay.

1448
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:13,100
Besides the Pont podcast,

1449
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:17,360
beside the books and you want
to have more interaction,

1450
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:21,740
take it to the next level. And we have a
leadership consulting company. It's me,

1451
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,950

Denelle. It's Dave Burke.

1458
01:27:56,931 --> 01:28:00,830
us the freedom and protection
to make this podcast possible.

1459
01:28:00,831 --> 01:28:05,831
Our service men and women in uniform
protecting us from the enemy and fighting

1460
01:28:06,831 --> 01:28:08,330
the good fight.
Thank you.

1461
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:13,130
And to the police and law enforcement
and firefighters and paramedics and the

1462
01:28:13,131 --> 01:28:14,780
rest of the first responders out there.

1463
01:28:14,781 --> 01:28:17,600
Thank you for answering
the call when we call

1464
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:23,230
and to everyone out there,
there's an enemy

1465
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:29,790
and whether that is a literal enemy
like our military personnel face or a

1466
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:34,090
metaphorical enemy like
people face every day,

1467
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:35,950
don't fear the enemy.

1468
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:42,910
Respect the enemy and out of
your respect for the enemy.

1469
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,473
Prepare.

1470
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:46,370
Okay.

1471
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:51,370
Prepare and train and learn and
stay vigilant and stay disciplined.

1472
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:57,050
So when the enemy comes,
you are ready

1473
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:03,560
to get after it.
And until next time,

1474

this is echo and Jocko out.
