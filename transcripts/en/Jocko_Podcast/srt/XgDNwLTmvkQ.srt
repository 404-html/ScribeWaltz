00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,090
This is Jocko podcast number
93 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,430
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:18,060
I was lucky and blessed to have had
the honor to serve in the United States

4
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,840
military during the time of war.

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,480
I fought alongside us army soldiers,
sailors,

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,230
and marines on violent battlefields,

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,940
and I saw with my own eyes,

8
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,570
my generation of warriors uphold the
proud tradition of the American fighting

9
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,043
man.

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,410
America's military has a
storied history of bravery,

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,700
ingenuity,
and grit,

12
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,570
but it's most important.
Tradition is the tradition of victory.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,453
Yeah,

14
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,290
America's military wins wars.
It is as simple as that.

15
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,870
If our nation deems it morally right,

16
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,600
an existentially necessary,
then our military is unstoppable,

17
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,340
of course,
and rightfully so.

18
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:45,610
The credit for victory is often
given to the men on the front lines

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,310
to those that are taking the fight to
our nation's enemies in close combat.

20
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,440
That credit,
he's well deserved.

21
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,930
But it is not the only credit
that needs to be bestowed

22
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:15,120
because it is a simple fact that many
of the most critical victories in

23
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:21,160
America's history, we're one not
only on distant bloody battlefields,

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,360
but we're also one right here at home

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,130
in factories,

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,030
fields and farms.

27
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,760
You see, our ability
to produce, to design,

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,350
grow,
build,

29
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:47,700
and manufacturer has been just important
to our nation's victories as our

30
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:48,690
ability to fight.

31
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,170
And throughout history,

32
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,430
when Americans march to war,

33
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,770
we marched wearing boots
made by American hands

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,880
and we wore uniforms that were cut
and sewn in factories like this one,

35
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,620
our body armor,

36
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,710
helmets and weapons have been the
products of American work ethic,

37
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,860
skill and determination.

38
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,910
The best planes,
ships and vehicles in the world.

39
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,780
Okay,

40
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,290
that carry us to war and then
support us on the battlefield.

41
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,170
They only exist because
Americans built them.

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,750
Without the American worker,
there can be no American soldier.

43
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,710
So let us never forget

44
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,910
that the freedom we cherish
so dearly is a gift,

45
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,610
not only from our American
service men and women,

46
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:09,040
but it is also a gift
from the American worker.

47
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,010
The American worker who toils in fields,

48
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,240
in factories,
in ship yards and on job sites.

49
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,230
The American worker who gets
up day after day after day,

50
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,990
not only to build and create products,

51
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,460
but also to build our economy for
strongest economy in the world,

52
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,580
which gives us unmatched influence.

53
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,270
Yeah.

54
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,270
And gives our great nation the ability
to make the world a better place.

55
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,250
With that knowledge,

56
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,460
I could not be prouder to stand here
today and be apart of this opening.

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,460
I could not be prouder to be a
part of this company or a gin

58
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,400
which like America itself,

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,540
we'll succeed because of the
power of the American worker.

60
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,400
Okay.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,450
It will succeed because of
the power of American grit

62
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:29,901
in origin.

63
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:34,901
USA will succeed because of the
unmatched power of the American dream.

64
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,760
And I would like to thank all of you,

65
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,380
especially America's workforce

66
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,980
for making this dream possible.

67
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,200
And
that is a speech

68
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,150
that I gave today in a
town called Farmington,

69
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,641
Maine and I was at the opening
of the new origin USA factory.

70
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,350
Now,
as I've been saying,

71
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,520
we are now in league with origin
USA and tonight I have with me

72
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,970
our new partner

73
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,470
and our new friend Pete Roberts,

74
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,900
who as you will see,

75
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,901
has shown some pretty incredible
fortitude in the business world and who I

76
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,070
believe is just getting warmed up.

77
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:54,560
So Mr Pete Roberts,
founder of origin USA,

78
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,160
black belt in Jujitsu by the way,

79
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:03,310
and also black belt in
making things happen.

80
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,830
Welcome to the show man

81
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:12,470
audit to be everything you just said, man.

82
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:17,471
Just captures everything I feel
in my heart and mind for sure.

83
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,200
When you're in that speech
live was phenomenal.

84
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,510
You know, it was awesome walking
around the factory and meeting people,

85
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,550
meeting the workers here. I
mean just, we came in and Jill,

86
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,590
she was, she was, it's a week of vacation.
What she doing? She's in here working,

87
00:07:34,591 --> 00:07:37,950
she's working and you know, just,
and, and I wasn't even really,

88
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:41,460
didn't really know what I
was going to say. But after
coming up here, meeting her,

89
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,380
seeing the rest of the people grinding
to make this happen, um, yeah,

90
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,930
I realized that I realized
exactly what I was gonna say.

91
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,800
I was going to talk about the fact
that literally metal and a battlefield,

92
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,270
you're, you're, you're,

93
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,480
you're propelled there by American
workers and that's what this,

94
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,430
that's what this represents.
And uh, you know,

95
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:07,431
we'll get into how all this kind of came
together in this kind of perfect storm.

96
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,900
Yeah. We'll get there, but we'll
get there in a little while. Okay.

97
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Because first we got to know a little
about a bit about you and your crazy ass,

98
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,770
which I say with all you know,
in the most complimentary possible way.

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,780
So tell us about just growing up,
like,

100
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,310
get me from like birth to high school.

101
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,230
What was that all about?
Absolutely.

102
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,260
So it all started in Sparta back,
man.

103
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,490
I'm for real. It's real spartan blood
for real. Yeah. No, my, my uh, what's,

104
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,820
what's your, what's your, because Robert's
isn't no Angelakis I'm Greek. Yeah.

105
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,540
Moms and ended in July.
She's great.

106
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,010
So she's clearly Greek cause
I miss clearly she's Greek
and she made that bottle

107
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,330
of off today.
No,

108
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,210
I thought she might pull out a spartan
sword at some point in like attack me

109
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:08,700
instead. She's pulled out a big
thing of baklava and sugarcoated it.

110
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,380
You just don't care. Did you feel guilty
about eating? Um, no. I wanted more. Yeah.

111
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,790
How do you came over here?
Like where's all the pocket?

112
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,980
I'm like, it's gone. And I
looked over, there's six pieces
left. I had four of them.

113
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,740
That's awesome. No, I'm a, I'm
a half breed. Just half Spartan,

114
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,320
so no, uh, yeah man.

115
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:36,060
I mean like the rest of America.
You know my,

116
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:40,440
my grandparents immigrated from Sparta,

117
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,930
Greece and the early 19 hundreds.
Great.

118
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,430
Graham lived to 105 legit credit.
Yes.

119
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,710
Yes. My, my semen on Jocko white tea.

120
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,420
Do you see as some of the shoe stuff
going on through it? She actually, she,

121
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:56,060
I know she didn't need to be, she had
the Mediterranean Diet. Nice. Hey,

122
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,880
when my son got to meet her, but she
lived for a long time, but awesome. Yeah.

123
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:02,310
So from a young age,

124
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:07,260
I got to see the American dream
from my mom's side of the family,

125
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,210
you know, and when we were kids, uh,
I was born down in Massachusetts,

126
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,210
Gloucester and, uh, moved up
here when I was a young kid.

127
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,230
My mom wants me to get myself and my
three siblings out of Massachusetts and

128
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:28,230
into the woods just cause she saw some
shifts happening. She didn't like.

129
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,840
So she brought us up here and
said,

130
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,810
make a go of it basically. And what,
what business or whatever, what to date,

131
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,520
what did your Oh, why
saw, I got to see my,

132
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,780
my family built some pretty, pretty
cool businesses down in Massachusetts.

133
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:50,280
So being an entrepreneur was
something I always admired,

134
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,070
uh,
but didn't realize I

135
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:58,990
wanted to do that until a
little later in life. Um,

136
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,580
but my, my, my family down there, uh,

137
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,590
my grandfather had a sub shop,
you know, supercell for those you,

138
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,900
I dunno,
there's,

139
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,730
that's the one of those things where
they call it different things across

140
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:17,470
America. A sub in New England is
the same thing as a subway sandwich.

141
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,160
Uh, also in New England, you call it
a grinder. Do you call it a grinder?

142
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,580
A grinder would be,
I think technically,

143
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,500
oh no, that's not a hot sandwich.
That's Hoagie. Oh yeah. Hoagies boy.

144
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,670
Yeah, that's another one. Uh, poor,
poor boy, another word for it.

145
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,620
So sub, sub. So granddad
owned a sub shop, a few,

146
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:45,460
a few subs. Very successful with
the sandwich making. Nice. Uh,

147
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,750
I got to see that in my
cousin's built a big multi,

148
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,490
multimillion dollar company and I,

149
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:53,650
and I had the watch this from a way cause
I moved up to here to Maine when I was

150
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:54,484
eight years old.

151
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,930
So I wasn't cultured in that
at all in the business world.

152
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,980
I didn't have anybody to teach me about
business and I just got to see it in and

153
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,830
not be directly part of it,
which I always wanted to be,

154
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,390
you know. Um, but I always looked
up to them and, and, and whatnot.

155
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:17,800
And both from business perspective
in athletics, you know,

156
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:22,510
they were very good athletics
and my family and, and my
uncles, cousins and stuff.

157
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,343
So

158
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,410
I looked from afar up here in Maine and
the woods and an old farm house down a

159
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:33,910
dirt road with no neighbors. Cows in a
field or, yeah, that's where I grew up.

160
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,750
And then high school, you, you said you
were, I know you're athletic. What do you,

161
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,680
how, how tall are you? Six.
Three and shrinking six,

162
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,620
three and shrink and man, those
and what's your Max, what's your,

163
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,060
what are you walking
around that right now?

164
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:52,050
Right now I can tell you
exactly to 53.0 [inaudible] yes.

165
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:56,140
But you played, what'd you
play? I uh, in, in high school,

166
00:12:56,141 --> 00:13:00,670
three sport athlete in College Football,
a division one for a couple of years.

167
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,350
I'm not the best experience of my life
learning experience, but not the best.

168
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,880
What? Well, why wasn't it the
best experience in your life? Uh,

169
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,190
you know, I was, I was real good at
football. I was not passionate about it.

170
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,700
Um, but I still worked my ass off because
that's the thing. You were kind of,

171
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,590
even though you were this big Jock,
I was,

172
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,340
you are also an artistic
guy, right? Artsy fartsy.

173
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,530
I was at artsy fartsy kid. I got along
with everybody, the jocks, athletes,

174
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,290
all the artsy kids, you
know, I liked everybody.

175
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:38,830
I could appreciate everybody's
talents where you like drawing,

176
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,720
painting or we doing everything
above painting, painting, sculpting,

177
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,920
everything. Just doing everything
and tackling people. Yeah.

178
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,560
Getting tackled,
play tight end.

179
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:54,850
It's where you more passionate about art
than you were about football for sure.

180
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,100
For sure.
And so you're playing football,

181
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,680
like it wasn't just one of those
things where you're like, Hey,

182
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:01,660
I'm good at it and I'm
getting a scholarship,

183
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,160
so I'm just gonna keep
doing what I'm doing. Yeah.

184
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:06,810
So back in 1997 pair can,

185
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,740
the jury is back in the
day. Yeah, no, it was,

186
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:15,970
uh, back in the day, some
will remember hockey fans,

187
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,660
Mainz hockey team was phenomenal and
they had to Korea kids on there and they

188
00:14:22,511 --> 00:14:24,760
were that that team took gifts.

189
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,260
And what happens when you get gifts
and people find out sanctions.

190
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,620
So I went into college and
they had like 10 scholarships.

191
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,860
So I didn't actually have a scholarship
until my second year of college.

192
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,780
Kind of had to prove myself
and I worked my ass off.

193
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,990
And then I f I fell into the politics
of college football and I saw the ugly

194
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:51,570
side of the politics of college football.
And uh,

195
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,450
and what are you talking about?

196
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:56,690
Cause I'm the only guy sitting at the
table that he didn't apparently play

197
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:01,450
college football is busy in the
teams after it. What does it mean?

198
00:15:01,451 --> 00:15:02,241
What does that consist of?

199
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:05,780
Like you're trying to get to be in this
certain position starting or is that

200
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:10,720
what we're talking about? Let's say
like, okay. Yeah. So I was supposed to,

201
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:13,950
I was supposed to start my
I red shirted my freshman,

202
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:18,160
I was supposed to start tight end,
got into a bar brawl,

203
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,870
right. And during the summer and couldn't
play the first few games. And it was me.

204
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,860
And what, uh, one of
my friends and we were,

205
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:28,600
were both freshmen and he
was a big kid, local kid. Uh,

206
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,920
he ended up playing in the NFL

207
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,810
and we were kind of like fighting for
the first spot on the depth chart and a

208
00:15:34,811 --> 00:15:39,010
depth chart if for those of you who don't
know is like kind of where you stand,

209
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:39,670
right.
You know,

210
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,360
and you see your name on there and you
see everyone else's name and you want to

211
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,980
be the top guy. Right. So break that
out for every position. Oh yeah.

212
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,020
Oh yeah. Every position check.
Yeah. So little pressure to perform.

213
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,300
And I stayed after my freshman. I put
on 27 pounds of like hard earned muscle,

214
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,800
no illegal substances,
squats,

215
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,780
Mcdonald's and squats.
Maybe like Pete,

216
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:10,640
go eat some food at
Mcdonald's. What did you, what,

217
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,490
what'd you go from what
weight to what weight?

218
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,840
And I think I came into college
at Lake too. It was like

219
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,700
200 in like two 25 and you
went to no less 10 maybe.

220
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,380
Oh Dang high school. And then uh,
yeah. And then just earned it,

221
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,850
earned it in the gym. I remember my tight
end coach coming up to me and saying,

222
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:35,530
Hey, you know Steve, Steve was his name.
He's like, he's out. And he's like,

223
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:39,700
you're going to be starting this first
game. And I'm like, Shit. I mean I stayed,

224
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,920
I stayed like work my ass off,
you know,

225
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:45,360
stay during breaks and everything
and I was a good athlete.

226
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,680
And what's cool is that you're actually
going as hard as you can you ask

227
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:52,360
something, you weren't even that
passionate. No, but I committed to him.

228
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,540
He just wanted to win. Yes.
Yeah, no, I do it. Okay.

229
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,010
You look at yourself in that depth chart,

230
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,940
even if you don't necessarily
like what you're doing,

231
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,200
you make the commitment and you drive.
And I didn't want to be number two,

232
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,430
you know, so it's super
competitive. College sports.

233
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,880
So anyways, my tight end
coach, like you're starting
the first game. I'm like, yes,

234
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,960
call all my family. Call on my
friends, tell them what's up,

235
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,860
make sure everyone has tickets, Yada,
Yada, Yada. Like a day before the game,

236
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,470
the coach comes to me and says, Pete,
I gotta talk to you. And I said,

237
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,640
okay. He's like, I just got in a huge

238
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:40,080
argument where the head coach and you
will not be starting in the football game.

239
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,700
I said, okay, why? He goes,

240
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,140
basically told me politics.
My friend still a friend of mine,

241
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,560
local kid,
he came in on a full ride,

242
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,620
local kid,
big kid,

243
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,700
had probably a better frame to build on.

244
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,130
And basically what the, even though
maybe I, you know, it's college,

245
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:12,660
we have different gifts. The head
coach shut it down and said, nope,

246
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:16,770
he's not starting. My coach
was like, he should start.

247
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,370
He's performing better. You know,
he's strong in the weight room,

248
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,070
hang clean and 300 pounds.
The kids ready to go.

249
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,350
He should be starting to get a huge
fight. Almost got fired. The coach at my,

250
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,750
my Ted and coach,
I'm Scott fired.

251
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,590
He said you'll be playing
a lot in the game though.

252
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:36,470
But yeah, he'll be starting. And
guess how much playing time I saw?

253
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,460
None. Zero. Who?

254
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,460
So that was the first game of the season
you said? Yeah. And so then what happens?

255
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,380
You grind out the rest of the season.
Yeah man. How's your attitude?

256
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,940
I

257
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,830
worked my ass off to her. You kept
grind to earn. Did you ever start?

258
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,140
Here's the shitty thing. I'd
already sounded pretty sure.
It's pretty shitty. Dude.

259
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,970
Here's the shitty thing and I couldn't,
I'm telling you I had football,

260
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:11,110
PTSD after this.
I didn't watch football for 10 years.

261
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,190
They put it on television. I'd walk
out of the room, I just hang out,

262
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,900
do something else. They'd be watching the
games. My son loves football. My find,

263
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,400
my family loves football.
Couldn't do it. I had like a,

264
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,050
just a version to the sport
to make a long story short.

265
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,110
Good. Cause it's been 45 minutes.
We haven't even made it past shut.

266
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:33,040
How long has it been? Has It my, my uh,

267
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,060
my scholarship. The money, like, like some
of the money hits your account. Right?

268
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,520
And like shit didn't kick in for like
my food and everything and my, my coach,

269
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,940
the head coach who is a narcissistic guy,

270
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,470
loved coming to the weight room
and just like waving his hair.

271
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,170
I don't one of those guys, you
know one of those guys. Yeah,

272
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,190
call it from what grave and that
he's like, I'll take care of it.

273
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,740
That's fine. Everything's happening. Okay.

274
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,570
Week later coach still this, this isn't,
you know, I'm, I'm on it. I'm on it.

275
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,840
I'm talking with EAD. It's everything's
good. We cleaner going coach.

276
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:11,960
It's still like, man, I'm stressing. You
know, like I'm going to have to get a job.

277
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:16,880
Like what's up with this? He goes, I need
to talk to you, my office and said, okay.

278
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,100
I sit down in his office,

279
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,350
your scholarship money
is not going to kick in.

280
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,493
Really.

281
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,100
I over gave
title nine had kicked in

282
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,690
and he overcame it.

283
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Now is he being truthful with me or did
he find a new recruit that was better

284
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,580
that he pushed me out. Who
knows? I don't know why.

285
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:58,000
Cause the kid behind me, I ended up
starting full back the next year. Right.

286
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,260
So maybe I got pushed out.
Maybe he over gave.

287
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,820
Fact of the matter is
that bastard lied to me.

288
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,800
It didn't fall through with his word.

289
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,300
And that will never happen again.

290
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,360
I will never surround myself with those
types of people in that lesson I carry

291
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,640
to this day, I think about
it a lot. It's one of those

292
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,660
moments in your life that kind of
changes your life. I said, you know,

293
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,550
I'm tell you something, I worked my
balls off for you in this program.

294
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm ready and this is what I get

295
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,630
that excuse

296
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,740
out out of the office.

297
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,990
I grabbed my cleats and that it of my
buddy Chad Rogers and walked out the door

298
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:51,610
and didn't look back. And
that was that. So with that,

299
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,950
that was your sophomore year? Yeah,
that would have been my red shirt.

300
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,910
It was right after my wrist.
Yeah, sophomore year. Yeah. Yeah.

301
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,500
So what are you studying at this time?
Studying a new media,

302
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,850
which was really new cause he
remembered the Internet hidden like 97,

303
00:22:07,851 --> 00:22:12,790
98 became hot. Right. Really
there's a date on that link.

304
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:17,450
You can call it 97. That's when it
became hot. Yeah, for sure. I think so.

305
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,640
Yeah, for sure. 90 said,
can you guys word for it?

306
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,490
That's what it was like the Internet.
Everybody need,

307
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:27,030
everybody has the aol.com Yay.
Netscape Nikki here.

308
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,820
But you, you could really surf the
web and websites and stuff. Yeah.

309
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,020
And website development and flat.
This flashy came out, macro media,

310
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,890
all this stuff. So anyways, I was
into that. I I uh, discovered the,

311
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,120
the computer thing

312
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:48,190
fell in love with design on the computer.

313
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,670
And although I was a sculpture major,

314
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,850
I used to weld up crazy looking shit.

315
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:59,851
I I actually zippered to cope post
dude I did for like my final project.

316
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,130
You want to know what I did?

317
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,880
I built this big frigging zipper on
this like canvas and I erected it and I

318
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,450
zippered up the gold coast.

319
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,470
I'm talking to like the
real zipper real different,

320
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,100
you know like the thing that like the
thing you hold the dude, it was this big.

321
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,870
I sit my, my, my, my art teacher.
They allowed you to do that.

322
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,560
I didn't have a choice. I just went
out and did it. Savage style. Yeah.

323
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,710
And what's that like street art.
I don't even know.

324
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,080
It was weird. I think I got some of that
frustration out for sure. Bring it up.

325
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,000
I have never made that
anybody that my, my my wait,

326
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:45,030
did you get graded on it? Yeah. Dude.
So how did you not tell anybody?

327
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,910
Because what happened was is I erected
it in the practice field and my teacher,

328
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:54,540
she walked over with me to look at
it and she looked at me and she goes,

329
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,870
a plus B. You did it listen like
you did in the end. It's like, Hey,

330
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:02,780
come look at this. She goes,
she looked at me, she goes,

331
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,970
you're saying what
she,

332
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,880
she didn't think it was
possible, bro. When you said
like I zippered my goal. Plus,

333
00:24:10,881 --> 00:24:13,700
I'm sitting here thinking, what is
this some slang term that I don't know.

334
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,530
Does that mean zip hang, hanging toilet
paper off of it? Like what does this mean?

335
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,430
Zipper Nene zippering as what it be. I
wish I had a photo of it. I wish she did.

336
00:24:22,431 --> 00:24:26,870
We didn't have digital cameras back then.
Yeah, but that teacher was cool. She was,

337
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,591
I don't remember her name,

338
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:31,250
but she was Korean and you left it up
for the practice guys. When they shut up,

339
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:35,180
pull it down. Uh, she, she actually told,
pulled me aside one time and she was like,

340
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:40,250
you drive this class,
how what you do and how you act.

341
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,270
Every one is going to follow.
Basically she was,

342
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:49,271
she was pretty cool but that is was a
gentle vengeance giving you props for that

343
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:54,210
shipper. Done zipper it, nothing's
happening. The goalpost man,

344
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,720
I think it was called 35 feet,
30 feet,

345
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,630
probably more than like the full goal
Polo. That depends on the practice field.

346
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,480
We helped you very fully zippered.
I am not even kidding.

347
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,080
I put that I put in in a,
and I,

348
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:13,070
and I built it out of like wood laminated
band saw like all the lugs and I had

349
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:16,040
to fit together perfectly in that
whole zipper part. Had the zip,

350
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,090
it was functional national giant.
That's good.

351
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,690
I told my teacher I was new, she's like
impossible to make it function. Oh, okay.

352
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,220
Let's see. Yeah. Like I said, it's
fortitude that I mentioned that earlier.

353
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,610
So, and at this time, what are you,

354
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,270
what's going on personally?
Personal Life, don't you?

355
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:42,110
With your high school sweetheart
at this was, yeah. Yeah. So I,

356
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,310
my wife Amanda, my bride, uh,

357
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,620
we got together and we were 16,
15,

358
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:52,910
16 through,
through a difficult situation.

359
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,950
We became friends and we've
been together ever since.

360
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,410
They were drawn together
by a difficult situation.

361
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:03,800
And you stayed together through college?
Absolutely.

362
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,520
And she wasn't looking at you like,
like, I need to get away from this guy.

363
00:26:07,521 --> 00:26:10,700
He said, you know, she,

364
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,740
she's very understanding apparently.
Yeah. Yeah. You know, the corny line,

365
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,610
like you complete me. Like
she, I tell people like she,

366
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:21,200
if my glass is a little full,

367
00:26:21,201 --> 00:26:25,370
she just dumps them out and
if it's running a little
dry, she puts it back in. So,

368
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,320
and she always has,
you know what I mean?

369
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,040
So she's brutally honest and

370
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:39,290
you know, just by my soulmate.
No, that's awesome that you
guys were, uh, you know, I,

371
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:44,160
I knew that, but it's kind of cool
that you guys together all that time

372
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,080
now back to your,
your major and now,

373
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,970
now you're not playing football and
now you're sitting there in college,

374
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,430
you're studying new media,
which no one knows anything about.

375
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:57,210
I didn't even know anything about it.
And we actually hired the professors,

376
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,800
my class really,

377
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,730
we committee of students and we
hire the frequent professors and so,

378
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,710
and so then you're learning how to do
what? Build websites, stuff like this.

379
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,430
You're learning things like, uh, it's
what all like the first software hit.

380
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:15,240
You had like this Maya and you
could do three d animation.

381
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:18,540
They built like toy story in
my or something you had like

382
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,530
flash Macromedia.
I remember the flash websites,

383
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:26,250
all the animation and stuff like
that. So we, I learned about that.

384
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,940
So how did you make the jump from
that to going into business in that

385
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:35,600
arena? I was good at it and
I was passionate about it.

386
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,080
And what happened is my sophomore year
after I got done playing football,

387
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,390
I went right to a marketing agency,

388
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,960
sold myself on the spot and got hired
on the spot and I became their lead web

389
00:27:48,981 --> 00:27:53,660
developer. And you're like
19 I was 19 with blonde hair.

390
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,290
Nice.
Yup.

391
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,730
They were like, who is this kid for?

392
00:28:01,731 --> 00:28:06,470
The record is when I was 19 I had blonde
hair too, the day. The similarities.

393
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:09,440
That's cool. Well a lot of
Hawaiians have blonde hair, so,

394
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,060
so 19 with blonde hair. Yeah, man.

395
00:28:14,061 --> 00:28:17,120
I walked in and I just sold myself.
Okay,

396
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:20,150
so then how did that morph
into your own business? Yeah,

397
00:28:20,151 --> 00:28:23,630
so I wasn't in a cush job. I take it
if you're the lead at 19 years old,

398
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:27,230
cush job at 200 bucks a week,
buddy raking,

399
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,050
which I needed was pretty legit for you
though, right? Yeah, because it was either

400
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,580
that or the y Ymca, you know,
and I did work at the y, but uh,

401
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,070
yeah,
I mean it was,

402
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,610
I cut my teeth at this ad agency where
I learned from this really good graphic

403
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:48,300
design of Brad who started
his career doing pay stop.

404
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:51,510
So paste up is like when
you're designing an ad,

405
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,740
you actually have to take an exam.

406
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,640
So all the little tools
you use when you're in like
Photoshop and other programs,

407
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:59,700
those are real tools,
real life tools. So he,

408
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,850
he takes like that knife and he cut
around the picture and then they put that

409
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:07,530
and then like the typography.
So I cut my teeth under a real designer.

410
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,540
Not many people get that anymore.

411
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,610
So I learned from a master of design.

412
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:17,560
And how long did you stay at that?
At that agency?

413
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:22,500
I was there till I was 19
2021 three years I think.

414
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,250
And then I, then I moved back and
I started my own company here.

415
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,890
And that was just

416
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,540
inspirado what, what, what, what
made you say, you know what?

417
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:36,280
Because you must have seen a pathway at
the agency to take over or not even take

418
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:36,461
over,

419
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:39,970
but just to move up the chain of command
and get paid more than 200 bucks a week

420
00:29:39,971 --> 00:29:42,280
and all that.
I did what your brain clicked

421
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,690
where you're like, you know what?
I'm not working for the man. Yeah,

422
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,750
absolutely. I'll tell you that. I got
to go back to give you that though.

423
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,070
Raking blueberries
and throwing hay.

424
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,260
[inaudible] manual labor.

425
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,920
Throw Hay for a day and get a $10 bill.

426
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,710
You're going to work very hard not to
do that. Raking blueberries in Maine,

427
00:30:06,711 --> 00:30:11,150
which is a staple of us Mainers.
Hmm. That's tough work. Your bed,

428
00:30:11,151 --> 00:30:13,400
Dover in the sun and the blueberry fields.

429
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,090
It guess what you do for your first week.
You earn your rake,

430
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,440
so what does that mean?
Does a different job that they do,

431
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,710
the rake picking or something.

432
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,070
You've got a buy that you've got to
buy the right rate. You're in debt,

433
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,000
you're either rake and
you have to work it off.

434
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,180
How much you think that rate Costa,
I'm doing the math. I'm like,

435
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,440
[inaudible] tells me, it's like,
this is tough, but I like it.

436
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,060
So when I, when I walked into my
interview at this marketing agency,

437
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:45,740
this kind of a pompous,
you know, kid, I said,

438
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:50,750
he said, what do you want to do longterm,
mark? I said, starting up my own business.

439
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:54,920
I'm going to own my own business.
He goes, you don't want to do that.

440
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,350
You do not want to own your own business.
You know,

441
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,170
you don't know what it takes to survive
in a world of business. And I said,

442
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,043
okay,

443
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,880
okay,
proceed.

444
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,630
Then I learned and sucked the knowledge.
I could, all the knowledge I could.

445
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:14,710
I just sucked it sucked and
sucked it. And then, uh,

446
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,880
I moved home and started
and what city was added?

447
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,590
I started, well, I started the
business out of my college apartment.

448
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:29,900
It was about as big as this table. I was
the man. No, I had a little a Mac. The um,

449
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:34,640
the black one, Wall Street. How would that
one, there was a man called Wall Street.

450
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,630
It had like a, it was black and
had like rubber on the sides.

451
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,110
You know what I mean? So you
were the man yeah. That you had.

452
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:46,580
I think that thing caused me some issues
because it was very tough to have kids.

453
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,750
I sat that thing on my lap for hours on
end and I'm telling you something with

454
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,670
radiation, man. I had to practice a
lot to have kids. Practice was good,

455
00:31:55,671 --> 00:32:00,470
but it got a little tough when it's like
we can't have kids. So, but uh, yeah man,

456
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:04,190
I started the business out of my
college apartment, my first insight,

457
00:32:04,191 --> 00:32:05,330
new media marketing agency,

458
00:32:05,331 --> 00:32:10,331
a new media company and just started
hammering and I was fearless going after

459
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:15,050
accounts and clients,
you know.

460
00:32:15,051 --> 00:32:18,830
And two years later I
find myself in Park City,

461
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:22,640
Utah sitting in the front of the
president of Rossignol, quicksilver,

462
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,910
selling them an idea like bill gates.
I didn't exist yet.

463
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,710
And telling them what I could do and
then they gave me the money to do it and

464
00:32:30,711 --> 00:32:34,370
then we did it. And uh,
the rest is history.

465
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:39,000
So ever until the recession, so
everything was rocking. And so did you,

466
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,780
so you are in your college apartment,
but then where'd you end up?

467
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,620
I ended up here in my hometown.
And you had space,

468
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,390
you got an office in all nine yards?
Yeah.

469
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:51,110
Well I started in a barn and
it was me and another guy,

470
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,550
my first hire and then we
moved into kind of like a,

471
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:59,670
like a double wide trailer house.
You know, we call it a double wide.

472
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,550
Did have a skirt? Yeah. Y'All. Yeah. Okay.
Let me ask you again. All vinyl skirt.

473
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:07,910
You kidding me? Who doesn't have a white
skirt? Got It. Got to keep it real.

474
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,890
So we went there and then we
moved into a basement in town.

475
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,100
This is like the perfect
progression, right? Yeah.

476
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:21,610
And then we hired a few more and
then we moved into a beautiful,

477
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:26,630
we had built out a
studio where man it was,

478
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:30,860
we actually designed it. And because
you were making legit money now we were,

479
00:33:30,861 --> 00:33:34,710
how many employees are we talking about?
I think maybe seven or something.

480
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,800
10 something like that. And now
you're 22 yeah, if that, yeah. Yeah,

481
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:43,600
probably 20 to 22 getting after 22
years old. Yup. Six employees. Yeah.

482
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,000
Costumed designed office space.
Everything you want to hear something,

483
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,120
I don't even know if I should say this.
You ready for this?

484
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,010
You may have to edit this out.
Alright.

485
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,340
I handled two governors
campaigns in Maine, 22 years old.

486
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,400
They wanted like the best design,
the best marketing.

487
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:09,401
So they came to these young
ins and we had this one guy,

488
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:14,180
uh, Les Otten should maybe
you not say the name you,

489
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,870
it was a national news. It's hard not
to. You can cut it out. Understood.

490
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,920
Really National News,
national news.

491
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,970
Really Nice Guy Right
after Obama's first term.

492
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:30,971
So les came and he wanted us to handle
this campaign and so he wanted a logo

493
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:35,420
that was circular, like
Obama's logo. And so we did a,

494
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,770
I designed myself a circular logo,
which green and blue,

495
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,250
very similar feel,
not even close to the same,

496
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,160
but it was around and who had
done around logo at that time.

497
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,090
Next thing I know this
thing ends up on CNN,

498
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,890
all the national news stations and they
have like the two logos have Obama's

499
00:34:54,891 --> 00:34:57,880
logo and lessons,
logo I Scott,

500
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,820
influx of emails and phone calls.
People like rip it.

501
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:06,050
Cause remember how that first term for
old palm, remember how hot that was?

502
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,370
Remember people negative when they were
negative on you because they were like,

503
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:15,200
we ripped it off. And I
was like, really? Really?

504
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:18,200
So it was round.
Don't make around logo,

505
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,370
especially after the first
Obama don't use circles,

506
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:26,900
don't use the circles. So, uh,

507
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,890
anyways, it was, it was,
it was an interesting time.

508
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:34,810
There's a little bit of
stress. Did he catch heat for
it? Obviously, I guess. Yeah.

509
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,410
Yeah, because no one really
cared. They, you know,

510
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:38,370
no one even knew they were like some,
he wasn't like,

511
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,820
oh my addict HSE made it up and I
thought it was great. No. Well He,

512
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,510
you know what they, you know,
kind of a little bit, he did that,

513
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:50,511
but he had an advice advisor that said
this is the right direction and whatnot.

514
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,010
So it was,
it was interesting times.

515
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:58,410
So what was the heat to the
heat was like national media,

516
00:35:58,411 --> 00:36:01,920
like ripping you down,
people dig down who designed it,

517
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,990
like the company that designed
it and just like daring you off.

518
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,710
They found your yearbook
picture or whatever it was.

519
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,660
That was like Obama was like
15 days of like holy shit.

520
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:16,050
Like are we gonna we gonna survive
this as a company, you know?

521
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:19,800
And we did. Yeah. Yeah.

522
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,390
And so you,
you survived that and,

523
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,740
and I guess your lesson is like from that,

524
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,950
that you can survive things you're
going to like, it's interesting,

525
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:33,720
I just caught that you said 15
days because guess what, 15 days,

526
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:36,800
no one cared anymore. Is that
pretty much pretty much, yeah. Yeah.

527
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,540
I see that a lot in the news. You know,
people, some will come on to all this,

528
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,450
people freak out about something
and I'm like, yeah, wait,

529
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,510
I'll wait a week for four days.
No one cares anymore.

530
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:50,570
There's like some other meteor that
hit the satellite thing or whatever.

531
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:54,990
Yeah. So you know, it was,
it was interesting, you know,

532
00:36:54,991 --> 00:36:59,310
we were young, you know, and naive,

533
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,760
you know. I mean, I think all
entrepreneurs start out naive honestly.

534
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,590
And from a leadership perspective,

535
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:07,940
you're in a leadership position
for the first time and,

536
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,570
and you have a team of six
people, you're the man. Yup.

537
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,600
And I'm trusting you seem you say
that with a little hesitation. Yeah.

538
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,880
I trust that people
will do the right thing.

539
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,240
Are The people that are working for
you your age? A little younger? Just,

540
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,320
just all the sides are the same age,
year or two difference. All young.

541
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:30,180
So now you said recession.
What happens there?

542
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,591
Well we were,

543
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:35,940
we were kind of like booming as a company
building some incredible that we would

544
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:39,570
do interactive touch screen
kiosks and all this really,

545
00:37:39,571 --> 00:37:42,000
really cool shit that nobody was doing it.

546
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,700
The recession hit.

547
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,620
We lost 65% of our business overnight.
I mean,

548
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:53,520
what's the first thing you
cut and recession advertising.
You're not supposed to,

549
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,230
but you do the wrong move, but it's the
move that everyone makes. Yeah, man,

550
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,100
I probably make the same move. Where
can we cut costs ad spend, right.

551
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:05,790
Stop that.
Anyways,

552
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:11,160
the recession hit and we had built
this company from like the ground up,

553
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:14,910
just funneled the money back into the
company, built, built, built by equipment,

554
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:17,910
Bill this, do all this
stuff. I'm like, Oh shit.

555
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,680
First time I thought about like
these guys bought houses here.

556
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,240
Have families are starting.
Families moved away.

557
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,480
How long had the run been at this point?
This had been,

558
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,160
this is a five year olds and that's a
good question. When does the recession?

559
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,660
Eight or nine this is six.
Seven year run. Okay. So yeah,

560
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:43,060
these guys had established their lives,
they established their families up here.

561
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,110
They, you were the,
for the form of income.

562
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,030
You're how they're paying their mortgage.
Absolutely. And I felt that, you know,

563
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,690
I don't know if that's a weakness,
but I'm sensitive to that man. I,

564
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,840
that's why promise somebody something
like this company is your future.

565
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,280
I mean this company is your future.

566
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,790
I will stop taking a paycheck and
that's not the right thing to do.

567
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:07,990
You got to always pay yourself.
Right.

568
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,130
I will stop taking a pay check
to make sure you get yours.

569
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:14,723
That's what I did.

570
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,210
And what I also did is I took out a
line of credit was the first money I had

571
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:21,010
taken out from the bank ever.

572
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,540
And I use that money to keep things going
to try to get through the recession.

573
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:30,550
And I didn't want to lay anybody off.

574
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,660
What I had them do was I had them start
designing in house. Cause by the way,

575
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,940
the next thing that you do
after you cut advertising,

576
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,570
the biggest cost to just about any
business there is as your people people.

577
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,310
So that's the next thing that gets cut.

578
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:46,530
But you're saying you're not
going to do that. And I'm,

579
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:51,390
and I'm young and learning about
business as I go, you know,

580
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,020
so no, I'm not going to do it now they,
some of them bought houses and stuff,

581
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:59,040
you know, like I'm not taking
away their livelihood, you know,

582
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,530
I'll find a way to just get
through. Right. You know, and I,

583
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,970
and I believe I had the fortitude
to get through, you know, but,

584
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,370
and there's the, but they
didn't. And here's why.

585
00:40:11,371 --> 00:40:12,204
Because

586
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,550
I had them start working on his house
in house projects and I was training

587
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:22,551
Jujitsu at the time and so I was going
to develop a platform so that an academy

588
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:28,431
could build a website based
off of a templated system
for their Jiu Jitsu school

589
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,990
and it was going to be bad ass.

590
00:40:30,991 --> 00:40:34,110
And we had done this for like
Rossignol Indiana Star we had,

591
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,140
we were like one of the first companies
to build online tools to build things.

592
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,583
Make sense?

593
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,670
There's a night early 2000 so when you
go on and you look at some product and

594
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:47,040
you want to, there's a little
customization that can be done to it.

595
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:52,070
You guys did design things to move the
mouse around and yeah, there's a bunch of,

596
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,300
there was none of them.
Zero.

597
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,330
And so we started building
this thing and you're be,

598
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,290
you're building this thing but you're
not being paid for it yet because

599
00:41:03,291 --> 00:41:04,780
eventually we're going to sell it.
So you're just,

600
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,850
that's what's your in house project.
Exactly.

601
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:12,320
Now did Jujitsu take a little bit
more of my time than it should have?

602
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,240
You know,
these things happen.

603
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,050
Did I think about it more than
anything else in the world? I did.

604
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:24,500
And just real quick, how'd
you get into Jujitsu? Well,

605
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:29,060
after football I stopped playing football
and I was like, man, I, I need to fight.

606
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,820
Like I need to add, you know, I
always had this desire to fight.

607
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,800
Maybe all men have,
I don't know,

608
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:37,910
but I felt like many extra
extra like I need to fight.

609
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,890
So I'm like taekwondo.

610
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,520
So I started fighting in taekwondo
and achieved that in about two years.

611
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:48,920
It was like, okay, now what?

612
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:54,420
And then I found Jujitsu and I got
choked out by 150 pound kid and I was 285

613
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,920
pounds and I was like,
that's a convincer,

614
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,640
couldn't figure it out. I came at
him with every bit of Athleticism,

615
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,110
could choke me out almost cold.

616
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,220
I had what just happened
and I bought into it.

617
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,430
So when he, ah, anyways, I,

618
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,960
I was passionate about Jujitsu and I want,

619
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,940
I had this perfect plan to build this
system and they started getting salty

620
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:23,774
about it.

621
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,650
Now is that because they felt like there
was an income is because they weren't

622
00:42:28,651 --> 00:42:31,050
getting paid by the project getting
a commission or something like that?

623
00:42:31,051 --> 00:42:33,390
What were they going to salty about?
They all got salaries.

624
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,950
So what were they getting salty about?

625
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,000
The fact that they were working
on my pet projects, those words,

626
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,450
my pet projects,
they were also salty.

627
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,460
I had two very young kids and my wife
in the office that the kids were in the

628
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:51,360
office and they were, you know, playing
with their stuff and doing what kids do.

629
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,930
Kids, they're being kids. My company,

630
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,640
my office, my kids. Okay.

631
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:05,450
They found that a problem.
So out of them. Yeah.

632
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,310
What was your relationship,
cause this, this,

633
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:11,490
I'm just assuming right now that you've
got a bunch of people that are working

634
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:13,400
for you that are around
the same age as you. Yep.

635
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:18,060
And so I'm guessing that you were kind
of broken out with me. We're Super Bros,

636
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,230
super burros, super immature, super bros.

637
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:28,270
Immature kids, right?
Talented, immature kids.

638
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,380
I mean you're talking about like, Hey,
let's shut it down and go snowboarding.

639
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,190
We've got two inches of POW
POW on Sugarloaf, you know,
and we need to hit that.

640
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,230
That's what we do. We just shut
it down, grab the stope wheel.

641
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,020
Rossignol would send us like
$10,000 in product. We just,

642
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:47,380
we just go out and we'd just rip,
rip on the mountain. Hey Man,

643
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:50,800
just get the work done. You know, all you
need to, yeah man. No worries. Just do,

644
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:55,310
just make sure the work's done.
Yup. Very loose. Super Burros.

645
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,120
Yes. Hitting the power
to, we call it powder.

646
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,160
So yeah,
man,

647
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:07,530
the relationship was not a boss,
worker,

648
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,440
employee relationship. It was
a creative, I always wanted to,

649
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,700
we had a foosball table in the,
in the, you know, give me a break.

650
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:18,700
I mean this is a creative
agency. Yup, Yup, Yup.

651
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,740
But when shit hits the fan, the
fingers go to one person. This guy,

652
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,000
right. So, all right, I'm ready to
sustain this thing and make it happen.

653
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:31,253
They weren't.

654
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,740
So one day I'm in my wife's office and
the whole crew gets up and hands me a

655
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:43,800
paper and it's a thick
paper and they're like,

656
00:44:43,801 --> 00:44:48,801
we'll see you on Monday to talk about
this because they thought they weren't

657
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:53,850
expendable. Okay. So they're
giving you an ultimatum. Ultimatum.

658
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:57,900
I was like, I turned white
for a second. I was like,

659
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,870
okay. When they walked out, were
you, did you anticipate this at all?

660
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,540
No.
No idea.

661
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,740
I will never be caught off guard like that
again. Yeah. That one's going to stick.

662
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,110
Now are going to leave a mark. This is
a mutiny, you know, straight up. New.

663
00:45:16,111 --> 00:45:18,210
Straight up mute. Yep. Okay.

664
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,010
My wife is an emotional being.
We sat down and we read this,

665
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,190
this paper,
and it was a list of demands,

666
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,160
a list of demands about profit sharing,

667
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,720
how the company was making all this money
and it wasn't being filtered down to

668
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:36,570
the employees and

669
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:38,900
okay.

670
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:43,900
About my kids and how they cannot come
into the office anymore because they make

671
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:47,540
noise,
a whole list of demands.

672
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:52,520
They can't concentrate when they're
playing foosball. Yeah. Eddie and yeah.

673
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,070
Amongst other things.
Young, stupid kids. Yeah.

674
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,500
And I was one of them.
Yeah, because I was naive.

675
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,210
So we started looking at this
thing and I was just like, wow.

676
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:07,980
It's like getting punched in the face.

677
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:15,630
And my wife went zing
and she spun up and shoo.

678
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,370
She's French Canadian and she's, she's,
you know. Yeah. Anyway, she spun up,

679
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:26,260
I said, okay. Does she speak
French when she's angry? No. Okay.

680
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:29,800
I wish that would be kind of hot.
If she did, I'd be like, Babe,

681
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:33,930
can you speak French? Just make her mad
so she could yell at you and yeah, no.

682
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:39,250
So,
so what we did is we just,

683
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:43,900
we sat there and looked at each other
and we're like, what? What? And I said,

684
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,010
do they have any idea?

685
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:49,900
We just took out a line of credit to
support this place to get through the

686
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:53,650
recession. They have any
idea, we don't have any work.

687
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,270
So what do we do?
RECON,

688
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,700
we opened up their computers,

689
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:05,760
logged in and started looking for all the
interaction between the staff and wow,

690
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,210
what they thought of me.
I was sad. I was like,

691
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,680
wow, this is sad. Maybe you
feel like shit, what they think.

692
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,560
I mean they thought I was
like some type of miser, like,

693
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,840
like squirreling away cash and
resources because I, because I was,

694
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:29,674
I

695
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,280
kept a straight face and hat how happy
personality and they had no idea how much

696
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:36,510
in the whole we were.
Yeah.

697
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,260
And I can imagine that you're trying to
actually protect them from the stress

698
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:43,630
and business. Yes. And in doing that,

699
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,690
you didn't communicate to them
what was actually happening,

700
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:49,450
which meant that they created what
was happening in their own minds,

701
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:50,830
which was obviously Raj shit.

702
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:56,020
Them creating what they think reality is
in their minds when they don't know all

703
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:56,471
the facts.

704
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:59,740
There's so many times in business when
I talk to businesses and businesses are

705
00:47:59,741 --> 00:48:04,120
going through transitions or there's
something happening and you know, they'll,

706
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,290
they'll be asking like, well do you think
we should tell you know the employees,

707
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:10,930
what's happening? And I'm like,
well you have two choices.

708
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,930
You can tell them what's happening or
they're going to make up a story to make

709
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:15,790
up a story and it's not going to be good.

710
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,650
They're going to think
worst case scenario.

711
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:22,240
And so the open communications that is
what is how you prevent this kind of

712
00:48:22,241 --> 00:48:25,270
thing.
And obviously you're 22 years old.

713
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:28,090
That's pretty awesome that you were in
a position you earning and obviously you

714
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:31,300
can look back now and it's pretty
simple to see what the solutions were.

715
00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,050
One of them, you were, you were
broken out with these guys too much.

716
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,640
And this is a fine line, you know,
because you know, in a seal platoon,

717
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,650
I had Bros,

718
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,700
all lifetime brothers that were,
you know,

719
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,320
three or four ranks below me.

720
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,580
But they were professional and they
understood the line between and they

721
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:55,770
understood and they
respected the position. And,

722
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,090
and then there's other guys that
were, you know, that same rank,

723
00:48:58,091 --> 00:49:00,910
lower rank that I could not,
I couldn't give that kind of closeness to.

724
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:03,270
And so that's one of those things that,
you know,

725
00:49:03,271 --> 00:49:07,240
w w we talk about a lot with companies
is it's different for the different

726
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:08,210
people in your company,
right?

727
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,490
So I'm not saying you can't bro out with
people and also that doesn't mean you

728
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,880
don't have awesome relationships with
your people because that's what you want.

729
00:49:15,881 --> 00:49:19,000
You want to have awesome relationships
with the people that are working for you

730
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:22,450
because they're going to do that much
more for you and you can do that much more

731
00:49:22,451 --> 00:49:27,280
for them and it becomes a functional
winning team because everyone cares about

732
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:30,040
each other. Exactly.
There's a dichotomy there.

733
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,960
Are we being there? The lines, are
we super burros? What does that,

734
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,410
what is that line? That line is the
thing that you need to figure out.

735
00:49:38,411 --> 00:49:40,930
What makes it really hard
with the relationship pieces
that it's different for

736
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:41,764
different people.

737
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,100
And I had some guys that was an e
five and a seal platoon and I was the

738
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:47,050
lieutenant and they were my total bros.

739
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,720
And there's another guy that's in e
five and I got to keep a little distance

740
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:53,890
just to make sure that they,
they stay professional. Right?

741
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:55,420
And so this is,

742
00:49:55,421 --> 00:49:58,270
this is challenging stuff and great
lessons learned for anyone running a

743
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:02,170
business, especially young people.
But it's not just young people.

744
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,260
Cause I see seasoned CEOs
asking these same questions,

745
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:11,350
learn this shit in college.
I'm so sorry. You know,

746
00:50:11,351 --> 00:50:16,030
like being an entrepreneur,
businessman or woman,

747
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:18,310
whatever it's learned.
You know,

748
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:21,550
you may have a gift of something
or accounting, you may,

749
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,130
maybe a good salesperson are
good at marketing or something.

750
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:27,990
Nobody's born with a gift of being an
entrepreneur. You know, it's built, it's

751
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:31,770
crafted over time and you have to fail
and fall flat on your face and get

752
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:34,720
punched in the face to
figure it out. Yeah. So,

753
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,390
but what's good is unfortunately there's
those like those lessons that your

754
00:50:39,391 --> 00:50:41,370
parents tried to teach you
but you didn't listen to.

755
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,090
And a commando so stupid if
you're even aware of them.

756
00:50:45,091 --> 00:50:47,220
And that's what's good about like
someone that's hearing what you're saying

757
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:50,640
right now.
They might not recognize it before.

758
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,270
And this is a chapter in extreme
ownership, right? Dichotomy of leadership.

759
00:50:54,271 --> 00:50:57,210
And you gotta be,
you can't be so close to your people.

760
00:50:57,211 --> 00:50:59,520
That one's more important
that we go through this.

761
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:05,030
But the awareness of it is it gives people
a percentage chance of maybe instead

762
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,260
of falling flat on their face,

763
00:51:07,261 --> 00:51:10,720
maybe they just stumble and they're able
to recover. Right? So this is, you know,

764
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,260
classic. I fell flat. Yes,
dude, it hurt too. Okay.

765
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,673
So what happens?

766
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:19,320
So I was,
I was sad man at first.

767
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:24,210
Then I got angry and then
I got to even, no, no,

768
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:29,410
I basically what it was is w we are not
expendable heed these words and these

769
00:51:33,241 --> 00:51:37,440
demands and we'll talk to
you Monday morning. Okay?

770
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:44,550
So what happens? We do a little
recon, get into the computers,

771
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,580
see the communication between all of them.
What they thought about me,

772
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:51,510
what they thought about my wife, what
they thought was going on with a company.

773
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,640
Half an hour later I'm in my
vehicle and divide and conquer.

774
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:59,580
You're not going to tell me.
Cause in that paper said,

775
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:04,200
do not come and see us individually.
Do not seek us out.

776
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,160
Do not try to separate one of us and have
a conversation and that's exactly what

777
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:11,154
I did.

778
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:15,000
By the way,
from the employee standpoint,

779
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,120
this is a horrible move.

780
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:21,870
They are making dupes as bad of a mistake
as you were making as a leader because

781
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:24,870
what they should have, any one of them
could have done is said, Pete, Bro,

782
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,730
I got to talk to you, man. Let me
tell you what's going on. Yeah,

783
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,910
this is what we're thinking. We don't
know what's going on with a company.

784
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,910
You guys working on these random
projects that are like your projects,

785
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,680
we should be working for other companies.

786
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,310
Can you tell us what in God's name
is going on so we can move forward?

787
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:38,941
That's what one of those,

788
00:52:38,941 --> 00:52:41,340
nobody was that mature and you could
have brought them into a room and said,

789
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:44,150
hey guys, I apologize for not telling
you, but let me tell you what,

790
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,870
what income we have on in the
next six months. Nothing. Nothing.

791
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:51,720
So this is what we're going to do.
Try and survive you to give them the plan.

792
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:53,810
They would understand why you were doing
what you're doing it right and it would

793
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:54,211
have been good.

794
00:52:54,211 --> 00:52:58,380
So both sides of the chain of command
there are actually making a grievous

795
00:52:58,381 --> 00:52:59,000
mistake,

796
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,740
bad mistakes. My and I learned
from that that that was, I mean I,

797
00:53:02,741 --> 00:53:04,460
I'm a transparent person as it is.

798
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:07,250
You can ask me anything you
want and I will answer it.

799
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:10,130
I was just a dumb kid though.

800
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:15,280
I didn't want to show weakness to
them is what I was thinking. Right.

801
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:19,190
Because I didn't want them to feel like
they needed to go find another job.

802
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,640
I didn't want him to think that start
talking like all the companies going to

803
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,350
shut down.
I was making my own stories.

804
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,350
I didn't trust they would make the
right decision if I told them this.

805
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:31,650
So I just carried on to try to
push through and you're right.

806
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,640
It was a mistake to not share it with
them because it would have been, I was,

807
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:38,220
we were bleeding as a company,
but they were,

808
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:43,250
the blood I was trying to keep in it
would have been easier just to let them

809
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,090
decide what they wanted
to do after in hindsight,

810
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:52,380
telling them where we were as a company,
how the recession had affected us,

811
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:56,190
but I didn't. Yeah, and so
I divided and conquered.

812
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,110
Meaning I got in my car,
drive to the first one's house,

813
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,840
knock on the door,
John,

814
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,090
we're going to talk or you have no job.
John's still with me right now.

815
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:13,890
He works for origin. I was
pissed. I was so pissed.

816
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:17,640
I was crying a little bit.
I was pissed at you were been so pissed.

817
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:22,350
Like you're just like you cried. Yes.

818
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,330
Negative next question.

819
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,920
Really. I don't know that even when you
were a kid it'll be, I mean, I'm like,

820
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:34,740
Oh yes. I guess I guess I'm
talking about being a seven.

821
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,780
I'm talking like 20 what am I,
2124 something like that.

822
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,830
I was in the teams at that point where
not crying. Okay. It's not happening.

823
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:50,280
This isn't one time to
echo.

824
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,110
I'm having a conversation with you.
Have you read it?

825
00:54:55,111 --> 00:54:56,140
So pissed you like started

826
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,260
crying?
Honestly,

827
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,710
crying is not like anger does
not lead to tears in my eyes.

828
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:04,880
For me crying is weakness.
Leaving the body.

829
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,710
I sad. Okay. I get it.

830
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,500
But being angry, that's, that's okay.

831
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,640
But you know everyone's a little
bit as a kid. Yeah, yeah. No,

832
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,080
I was a kid because the kid talk,

833
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,790
please remember I didn't have,
I didn't have a mentor either.

834
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:26,200
Like when I was a kid I didn't have, I
had, I had one mentor, my friend, my,

835
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,970
my buddy's father.
Cause it was a single single mom.

836
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:34,160
Who was it just we are as kids be a
lot of the time we raised ourselves,

837
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:39,490
I didn't have a mentor and having a father
figure around all the time to see how

838
00:55:39,501 --> 00:55:44,480
to, so I just, I worked off
of pure drive an emotion.

839
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:48,770
Yeah. Yeah. And again, I'm not trying to
be a jerk. No, I'm having fun with it.

840
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:53,060
But you're so pissed.
So pissed.

841
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:57,290
You've got freaking tears in your eyes
and you go to John and you fucking,

842
00:55:57,410 --> 00:56:00,950
you want this job or not
because if you say no,

843
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,780
you're not talking to me. You do not
have a job and you've got a new house.

844
00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,110
Okay, so he had, he's in the
car. Okay. One down, one down,

845
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,450
one in the game. Still in
one of the game. Got It.

846
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,490
As I drove to the other's houses,

847
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,020
they either didn't answer the door
and hid or answered the door and said,

848
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:22,550
I can't talk to you and closed it.

849
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,750
Okay. These our kids, you know like this
kid does, these are kids, which is a good,

850
00:56:28,751 --> 00:56:32,410
is a message to everybody. Yeah. When
you don't want to talk to somebody,

851
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,590
you're not solving anything.
You know what I mean? Yes.

852
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:40,600
Now I'm not saying that there's sometimes
where I'm so mad at you that I'm like,

853
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:44,530
Pete, come back tomorrow Bro. Cause right
now it ain't going to go good. Yeah.

854
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,660
I'm so mad I could cry or something like
that. It sounds really sensitive, man.

855
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:52,910
What'd you actually do that and
that is a week, but that is that.

856
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,500
The point is though,
seriously, if there's,

857
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:59,320
if there's a problem and you're
not going to talk about it,

858
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:01,960
you're going to sound like that kid
right there. That answers where I can't,

859
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,670
I can't talk to you right now.
We can shuts the door.

860
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:05,890
That's not a way to get anything solved.

861
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,870
Are there times where you need a little
bit of distance because people are hot

862
00:57:08,871 --> 00:57:10,240
headed? Yes, that happens.

863
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,300
As long as you know you're going to
see you both know that it's solvable.

864
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:20,620
You know, like I feel like with
respect to business and stuff like,

865
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,390
like if you're working with a client,

866
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,200
you may like bang heads with a client and
be like, all right, listen, we need to,

867
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,190
we need to shut this down and
discuss it like in 48 hours.

868
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,570
That's learned over time.
Not when you're a kid.

869
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:36,330
You just want to get after like Ah,

870
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:40,750
forget even your approach was
super hardcore and this is again,

871
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,330
you know people a little bit
aggressive. Yeah. People,

872
00:57:43,331 --> 00:57:46,810
people want to hear me say like, that's
right. You go in there and you say,

873
00:57:46,811 --> 00:57:51,490
you either talk to me now where you don't
have a job that was already bleeding

874
00:57:51,491 --> 00:57:55,120
though. So was that the right choice?
I don't know. But the, the, the,

875
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:57,880
the approach for me
would be like, um, hey,

876
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:02,650
let me explain to you what's going on
and then you can think more about your

877
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:06,660
decision because right now I'm telling
you what you've decided and what you've

878
00:58:06,661 --> 00:58:10,300
presented to me is so far off base that
if this is what you want to make your

879
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:11,170
decision based on,

880
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,150
I'm telling you what I'm going to have
to do is let you go because I haven't

881
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:16,810
told you yet,

882
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,690
but we don't have any money and I'm
paying you out of my own pocket.

883
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,900
So if you don't like that and you don't
want me to pay you out of my own pocket

884
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:24,640
or anymore,
I'm actually good with that.

885
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,910
But if you want to have a job and you
want to try and make this thing work,

886
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,410
let's have a conversation.
And that's close to exactly
what I would say now. Yeah,

887
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,950
exactly.
100% the reason I'm making this point,

888
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,850
because I had a guy hit me up
on social media the other day,

889
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,680
he asked a legit question and, and
he pre preface the question, he says,

890
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,780
I'm a very direct guy like you,
meaning he's direct like me.

891
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,711
And he says,

892
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:51,940
and I give feedback and it makes
people mad at rubs them the wrong way.

893
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:58,090
And I'm just, you know, I wrote back,
I go, look man, I'm direct on Twitter,

894
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:03,390
which is 140 characters and I'm
answering 720 questions in rapid fire.

895
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,260
And, and so yeah, I'm direct. When
someone says, well, what is your, you,

896
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:13,720
what is your average daily
diet consist of? Steak. Next
part. You know what I mean?

897
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,640
But with direct,
you're not an asshole.

898
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,350
But it's also like I'm having fun.
That's the fun part of,

899
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:23,780
you know, interacting with
people through social media.

900
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,800
That's not how I'm treating another
human being face to face in a real

901
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:30,170
relationship. When we're trying to
build something, then I'm using tact.

902
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:33,560
I'm using maneuvering, um, quorum,
manipulating the situation.

903
00:59:33,561 --> 00:59:36,740
I'm setting things up. I'm being
the most tactful person. In fact,

904
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,320
not only am I not going
to rub them the wrong way,

905
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,660
I'm going to rub them in a very nice way.

906
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,940
So they feel good about the
conversation that we had.

907
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,770
Disarm them and have a real conversation.
The point is, is that you know,

908
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:52,580
you're you, you were like, you
said what my little quote was,

909
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,560
is what you would say. Now back
then, you're young, you're bleeding.

910
00:59:57,561 --> 01:00:00,510
I'm bleeding. You're pissed
off. Yeah. And you say,

911
01:00:00,511 --> 01:00:03,320
you know what wife nagging
at me about finances. Yeah.

912
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,980
You know how that all builds to young
kids don't sleep through the night

913
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,490
it gets, it gets tricky and
you're trying to maintain this

914
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,240
so,
so just Fyi that what you just said.

915
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,350
Yeah.

916
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:18,890
You, you just said you know how
it is. And to be honest with you,

917
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:21,650
I don't know how that is
because I was in the military.

918
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,260
I got a paycheck every two
weeks. Yeah. I had kids,

919
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:27,430
I had health insurance taken care of,
I had a house taking care of it. It's,

920
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,850
it's a huge, it's, it's, it's, it's
actually a feeling. I don't know.

921
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,400
Um, so I, yeah, don't know that
feeling. I want to, I can only imagine.

922
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:43,390
I can only imagine what I
would be thinking if I was
in your shoes at 22 years

923
01:00:43,401 --> 01:00:47,840
old with a wife, two screaming
kids, and I don't have any money.

924
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:51,850
So yeah, check. Okay. And yet some,

925
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:55,730
I will tell you about that feeling. It's
a feeling I'm never going to go back to

926
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:58,250
as we,

927
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,630
as I divided and conquered
it did not go my way.

928
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:07,960
So meaning that the people were saying

929
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,520
they can't talk or they hid,
can't talk to you. They went,

930
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:12,320
they left their having their homes,
whatever.

931
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:19,000
So I made a decision what to do when I
told him, talk to my wife. She's like,

932
01:01:19,001 --> 01:01:23,350
what are we going to do?
I said, well, I said,

933
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:28,351
they all think they're expendable
except they're not because there's not a

934
01:01:29,861 --> 01:01:31,060
person in this world.

935
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:33,510
Okay.

936
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:38,220
That is so good. Oh, they
can't be recognized, right?
Yeah. Okay. Got It. Got It.

937
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:39,750
They think they're not expendable.

938
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:43,060
There's not a person's world
that is so good at their job.

939
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:47,120
They can't be replaced. Hmm. Did you hear
that echo? Yes, sir. Just just say it.

940
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,090
Almost none, but yeah,
you're right. You're right.

941
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,170
There's a lot of talented
people in the world.

942
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,650
So what did I do?
Hefty trash bags.

943
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:01,053
Get some,

944
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:07,320
I went up to that studio and I scraped
their desks individually into trash bags

945
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:12,150
and it felt good.
I didn't even mean to say that like,

946
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:16,930
but it felt good. Yeah. I
literally just scraped it,

947
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,300
tied it up, went to the next, my
wife just pushed it all into the bag.

948
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:26,780
This is good therapy. Yup.
Yup. We dragged all the shot.

949
01:02:26,781 --> 01:02:29,400
I didn't care what was in the bag.
I don't care what they had on their desks.

950
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,690
My property,

951
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:37,040
your shit in the trash bags.
Didn't organize nothing.

952
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:37,930
Just scraped.

953
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:43,670
Dragged him down the stairs gently because
I'm getting a feeling this was not as,

954
01:02:43,671 --> 01:02:47,440
you're not dragged them down the stairs.
We were in this,

955
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,380
this like studio,
you know,

956
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,580
third floor studio that we had
built out for us. Beautiful. Right?

957
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:02,670
That Monday morning the art director
who I cut my teeth with came down,

958
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:05,350
he lived in Bangor,
Maine.

959
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:10,710
We say Bangor came down and we were
sitting there and it was glass like the

960
01:03:11,801 --> 01:03:15,370
glass and it's like you could
see through it being inside,

961
01:03:15,371 --> 01:03:16,900
but from the outside you can't,

962
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,440
they all got out of the same vehicle,

963
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,770
kind of giggling and
chuckling like they own me,

964
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:28,960
they own this company and they walked
in the door and there we were sitting

965
01:03:28,961 --> 01:03:31,750
there with a trash bags and they went from

966
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,133
Giddy

967
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:41,660
to guilty to sadness and
their faces turned white.

968
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,620
There's your shit.
Take it.

969
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:48,103
Yeah.

970
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:53,350
And that was it. Done. That was tough.

971
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:57,520
I said a few words

972
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:04,990
but I was not going to be
held hostage to this situation

973
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:11,030
in business.
I,

974
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:15,060
I say you've got like 40
years of being a maker.

975
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,210
I did a speech recently
at an innovation for,

976
01:04:18,211 --> 01:04:20,760
I wrote a speech for an innovation expo.

977
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,580
It was zero to 20 year learning 20 to
60 you're doing and 60 to 80 hopefully

978
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,390
you're enjoying the fruits of your labor.

979
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,510
Anything good in life takes 10 years.

980
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,380
So my first 10 years had passed but I
still had 30 to go and so I knew I wasn't

981
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,543
done.

982
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:43,470
Yeah.

983
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:48,470
But the pain of the situation and the
in the experience I grew exponentially

984
01:04:49,621 --> 01:04:50,454
overnight.

985
01:04:53,450 --> 01:04:54,283
Yeah.

986
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,160
We had salvaged, a small part of
the company, which was a s was this,

987
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:02,910
we called it web were right.
It was like online software.

988
01:05:02,911 --> 01:05:06,570
Like everything is now like the cloud,
but there was no cloud,

989
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,490
there was this system,

990
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:12,750
I was able to salvage that
and because it had like a,

991
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,470
a cool little customer base of some high
end customers and they paid monthly,

992
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,480
it was just like reoccurring
payments. Right. Just to use it. Yeah.

993
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:27,570
And so I found a buyer for it and
the negotiation took a long time

994
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,190
and in that long time we had no income,
no money.

995
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:38,770
And so what did I do? I started
selling shit, dirt bikes,

996
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:41,830
four wheelers,
snowmobiles,

997
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:46,510
every nonessential item I owned got sold,

998
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:52,090
trying to maintain, keeping my
home right, which we had built,

999
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:57,070
my wife and I in the forest,
which was our dream home,

1000
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,740
just a tiny little 1500
square foot timber frame,

1001
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,990
borrowing money from family

1002
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:06,330
and

1003
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:10,330
and in our parents and them
knowing the situation we're in.

1004
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:14,770
So them actually just like
giving us food or whatever.

1005
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:20,820
That whole time I had the maintain like
the super composure to try and sell this

1006
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:24,790
thing at all.
This shit happening in the background

1007
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:32,220
and I think it was like eight months and
I finally sold it $200,000 I think it

1008
01:06:33,641 --> 01:06:35,680
was,
which

1009
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:44,610
was cheap for what we had built.
Extremely cheap,

1010
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:50,360
but I was in a position
where we had nothing left,

1011
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,090
had freaking nothing left.
You know,

1012
01:06:58,030 --> 01:06:59,500
it was super,

1013
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:05,130
super challenging and I could have
easily easily turned to substance abuse,

1014
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,750
which I didn't.
I've never been into substances.

1015
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:13,940
I could have easily just fell off
the deep end and felt like a failure,

1016
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,890
which I knew I wasn't.

1017
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,290
My wife wanted me to go find a job. She's
like, that's what I was about to say.

1018
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:27,730
I can't normal normal day you go get a
nine to five. I actually, I can't do this.

1019
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,730
I can't do this Pete.
I can't do this

1020
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:35,590
during that eight month stint, you've
got to figure it out. Myself paid.

1021
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:44,030
I will find a way to make this work
and I believe everything happens for a

1022
01:07:44,911 --> 01:07:45,744
reason.

1023
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:50,690
It happened for a reason and I just
kept that in the back of my head

1024
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:55,260
and I pushed and pushed and pushed forward

1025
01:07:56,790 --> 01:08:01,350
and it wasn't freaking easy like it
was super, super hard like on us,

1026
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:09,560
but she stood by me
unwavering.

1027
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,120
She stood by me.

1028
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:17,060
Never once did she want to leave,
did she

1029
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:25,820
not believe in me
or not trust me,

1030
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,280
which is what I needed.

1031
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:34,280
And like I said earlier about filling
the class back up, it was empty.

1032
01:08:34,281 --> 01:08:37,520
It was bone frigging dry,
bone dry,

1033
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,560
and she just put a little bit back in
and we kept moving and kept chugging.

1034
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:48,890
Now during that time period where
you're looking to sell the old company,

1035
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:55,060
are you hatching plans or is you gotta
be 100% focused on just so Moscow and my

1036
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,490
creativity dove to the
bottom of the ocean done.

1037
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:06,230
I was, I don't, I've never
experienced depression,

1038
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,710
you know, but I, I I get it.

1039
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:15,810
I felt a little bit like a failure.
Um,

1040
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:21,020
I felt a little bit like a failure,
but I knew I wasn't.

1041
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:26,690
So every time I had a negative thought,
I would just push through it.

1042
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:31,730
I just pushed her the thought and what
got me through a lot of that was training

1043
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:36,760
Jujitsu where I could expel my
energy and use my creativity,

1044
01:09:37,191 --> 01:09:39,440
which I thought I had lost in Jujitsu.

1045
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:44,620
It's a very creative sport
art and that kind of kept me,

1046
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:52,620
I guess it kept those endorphins flowing
so I could maintain some stability.

1047
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:59,500
But tactically your focus is
sell scata gotta make sales,

1048
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,490
make it look good.
Look,

1049
01:10:00,491 --> 01:10:03,220
let's show them the numbers that
are coming in for our few clients.

1050
01:10:03,221 --> 01:10:06,040
And a lot of projections could be,
Yep, that's all you're doing. Yup.

1051
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:08,710
That's all you're doing. And you're,
you're thinking when you sell that thing,

1052
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,230
you're going to have enough
and you'll figure it out later.

1053
01:10:11,231 --> 01:10:16,030
But you're not worried about it right
now. Exactly. So you make the sale.

1054
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:20,020
I make the sale for the first year.
We get a monthly check.

1055
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:25,390
No, it's like five grand a month
or something. Not the full amount,

1056
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,860
just like five grand a month.

1057
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:33,300
So during that time I decided to just
take 12 months and figure out what comes

1058
01:10:36,251 --> 01:10:37,084
next.

1059
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,890
And in that 12 months I traveled
around the country training,

1060
01:10:41,891 --> 01:10:45,520
Jujitsu and filming a
thing we call Bjj weekly

1061
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,910
because that's what I
was passionate about.

1062
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,600
And so we traveled around
and film technique and train
and all this stuff and it

1063
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:58,540
was like an excuse to train
Jujitsu. That's it. This newsletter.

1064
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:03,490
And
after that 12 months and traveling around,

1065
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:06,550
it just struck me what I wanted to do.

1066
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,740
Years earlier,

1067
01:11:08,741 --> 01:11:13,741
I had designed this logo for a GE
brand off the cough came to me.

1068
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:16,680
I get my ideas in the morning.

1069
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:22,350
One morning I sat down and just boom,
done five minutes.

1070
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,850
You know, sometimes you can have a
client come in. We used use doing,

1071
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:30,900
I'd spent a hundred hours on
the Friggen logo. You know,

1072
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:35,580
people don't realize how much locos costs
and sometimes you just nail it like 10

1073
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:40,050
minutes done, finished it just
like getting hit by lightning,

1074
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:42,630
just boom, done. That's what
happened with this origin thing.

1075
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,153
Okay.

1076
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:49,550
I wanted to start a brand because what
I had done and what I had learned and

1077
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:54,551
over that year of driving
round and training and
reconnecting with myself and my

1078
01:11:56,151 --> 01:12:01,151
family was that I loved
building brands and products.

1079
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,410
I loved taking something from nothing,

1080
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:14,470
like a drawing in making it into something
and I had an aversion to the screen.

1081
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,133
Okay.

1082
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:22,030
In that space,
because of the new media thing,

1083
01:12:22,031 --> 01:12:26,330
I was always on a screen and
I, I just, I told him, man, I,

1084
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:30,100
I need to like do something physically,

1085
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:35,160
like have something physical and you'd
have a physical thing to do because I was

1086
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:40,450
an art major and I'm an artist and I
zip up goalposts. I needed thing to do.

1087
01:12:40,451 --> 01:12:44,200
So in Jujitsu I had seen that the,

1088
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:47,210
the uniform like hadn't changed.
I Dunno,

1089
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:51,790
they'd been wearing Kimonos for a thousand
years, but you know, judo, you know,

1090
01:12:51,791 --> 01:12:56,320
hundreds of years did you to a hundred
years in Brazil, same thing. Same,

1091
01:12:56,350 --> 01:13:00,070
same damn thing. A hundred percent
cotton uniform. This is what you wear.

1092
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:03,340
And I was like, why?
Why do you wear the hat?

1093
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,400
You got under Armour with like wicking
stuff and you've got air helmets instead

1094
01:13:08,501 --> 01:13:10,600
of leather helmets.
And you know,

1095
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:14,110
just all these innovations in
other sports in Jujitsu had shit.

1096
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:19,430
We had nothing like wearing a bunch of
just straight cotton balls and no sweaty

1097
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:23,920
soaked in g that stretches and stinks bad.

1098
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:29,380
It's socked in. So to
start, I was like, okay,

1099
01:13:29,381 --> 01:13:34,180
I gotta start, I gotta start.
Meaning you, you now the vision,

1100
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:39,040
you see that gies haven't progressed, you
know that they can be made better. Yup.

1101
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,250
You, you don't actually
eat. And so you say, okay,

1102
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:46,870
I want to make the best guy in the
world. That's the vision. Yes it is.

1103
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,420
And you have to start somewhere.
You got to start somewhere.

1104
01:13:49,540 --> 01:13:53,470
So I didn't know anything about textiles,

1105
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:56,380
but I knew about design and
I knew about the human body.

1106
01:13:56,381 --> 01:14:01,180
And you know how the human body
worked in, in, in, in college sports,

1107
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:04,770
you learn about that a lot, you know,
mechanics, mechanics of the body,

1108
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:09,280
they retrain, knew how to run in
college. Like they, you all run the same,

1109
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:12,400
you do exercises. So you're all
striking, striking with your foot.

1110
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:13,390
You all run the same.

1111
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:18,820
And so I designed like a g pants
and it was like the cowboy cut.

1112
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:21,790
Cause I knew that in Jujitsu
when you're like you're,

1113
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:26,500
you're squatting a lot and on your knees
and the material pulled up your up your

1114
01:14:26,501 --> 01:14:31,330
leg but pulled down your butt.
So you're like got plumbers crack,

1115
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:37,240
which sucks. So I designed like, so
the kneepads came up to your hip,

1116
01:14:37,241 --> 01:14:39,430
so when you squatted it
would pull from your hips,

1117
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:43,900
right instead of a cross to
the top of your leg. And did,

1118
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:47,080
did some cool innovations like that. And
then I was like, all right, time to go.

1119
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,860
So we launched [inaudible] we, we, we,

1120
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,290
we imported the ski from Pakistan.

1121
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:58,480
One G I was in the basement of my house

1122
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:04,420
and I was like, we're going to start
this brand. So I hit the basement socked.

1123
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,630
Here comes a g,
we shot a photo,

1124
01:15:07,631 --> 01:15:12,631
we saw some photos off of it and I
launched it through Bjj weekly and boom,

1125
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:17,300
40 grand. I was like, wow.

1126
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:21,150
Which you didn't have any gies no,
none,

1127
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:23,223
no keys.

1128
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:28,840
But I wanted to prove that we could do
something different and I trust that I

1129
01:15:28,841 --> 01:15:31,420
could make it happen
knowing having the keys.

1130
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:37,300
I was like 200 yeas sold.
I've got something here.

1131
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:40,360
I've got something good here.

1132
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:47,440
And I knew a new adventure was
going to start and my wife's spun up

1133
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,870
in a positive way. No. Oh.

1134
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,940
She just like, what are you doing?
I'm like, I'm starting a key brand.

1135
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:05,260
And she like got sick. Like I know she
might had an anxiety attack at first.

1136
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:09,280
Like the [inaudible] you can't do
this again. You can't, you, you know,

1137
01:16:09,281 --> 01:16:12,550
you can't start another company.
You know? It's like just,

1138
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:18,070
and I use this word lightly
being around a war hero,

1139
01:16:18,071 --> 01:16:20,580
like you know,
Warrior here,

1140
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:23,830
I promise you that PTSD of business,
right?

1141
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,990
That's a real thing. Like she, she,

1142
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,920
she had like PTSD of business because
of what we had gone through and selling

1143
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:37,720
everything and the feeling you get
that you keep, you keep this feeling.

1144
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,040
For me, I used it for drive
for her. She used it for,

1145
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:45,070
I don't ever want to feel that again.

1146
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,760
That makes me like ill for me it was
like I'm never going to feel that again.

1147
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:55,540
I'm going to make sure I never feel
that again and I'm going to do something

1148
01:16:55,541 --> 01:16:58,840
about it.
So I did it anyways.

1149
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:02,590
Started a company origin and

1150
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:09,100
that's when it began.
2011 10 or 2000.

1151
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:14,060
So how do you start it?
You got one,

1152
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:18,500
Ge has sold 40 grand worth of one
guy that you didn't have. Right.

1153
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:19,790
What do you do next?

1154
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,880
Did you know at this point you
wanted to make them in America?

1155
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:26,480
Had you figured that part
out yet? No. No. I, I, I,

1156
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,960
let me take that back.
I figured you make them an American.

1157
01:17:28,961 --> 01:17:30,920
I want to be to make them in America.

1158
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:36,130
And so I started like calling all
the factories and in Maine like,

1159
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,820
hey, you know, you guys, so stuff.
Yeah. Cool. Can you sew this? No.

1160
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:44,120
Okay. So it was people, I don't know.

1161
01:17:44,150 --> 01:17:48,440
Maine has traditionally had
a lot of industry up here.

1162
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:53,360
Manufacturing big time. Especially when
we, when we were kids. Yes. Uh, you know,

1163
01:17:53,361 --> 01:17:56,540
big brands up here that build a
lot, you know, all kinds of stuff.

1164
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:01,040
Bashu 10 minutes away,
sold out Dexter Shoe,

1165
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:02,900
Hayden Shoe,
Lou Hayden,

1166
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,040
he owns San Antonio shoe passed away
and huge companies Llb new balance 20

1167
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:13,910
minutes away.
So rich heritage and manufacturing,

1168
01:18:16,050 --> 01:18:18,450
but apparel in Maine,

1169
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,290
a little different that we made shoes
and we a wool fabric and stuff like that.

1170
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:25,410
But apparel wasn't,
wasn't the norm.

1171
01:18:25,411 --> 01:18:29,850
So what I did is we are in that
basement and we're like, okay,

1172
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:32,460
and I just got to make this
note that, yeah, the, all those,

1173
01:18:32,461 --> 01:18:35,030
a lot of those companies
that you're talking about
that had built all this stuff

1174
01:18:35,031 --> 01:18:38,860
for, for all those years, a lot
of them had left. Yeah. So that,

1175
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,820
that's the political situation,

1176
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,880
except all of them had left ll bean.

1177
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:51,020
They still make some stuff here.
The rest left gone. So bounce,

1178
01:18:51,021 --> 01:18:53,760
still make some stuff here to write a new
balance stuff. Oh yeah. For sure. Yeah.

1179
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:57,060
New Balance is awesome. Uh, so

1180
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,050
yeah,

1181
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:02,830
I was like, okay, we're going to make
a belt. That's what we're gonna do.

1182
01:19:02,831 --> 01:19:07,180
We're gonna make a belt. A
jujitsu belt. Yeah. Yeah. So

1183
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:13,030
there was this guy and Lewiston
who ran this company and uh,

1184
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:17,050
I called him up. I'm like, I need some
sewing machines. And he's like, okay,

1185
01:19:17,051 --> 01:19:20,080
well why don't you stop by in Lewiston,
Maine,

1186
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:24,400
one of the manufacturing hubs of main
at one time walked in and he's like,

1187
01:19:24,401 --> 01:19:27,400
what do you need? I was like,
oh, this is what I want to make.

1188
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:31,740
It's a belt for martial arts.
It's like, okay. And I said,
I just need some machine,

1189
01:19:31,830 --> 01:19:36,250
a machine to do that. And like I got
500 bucks cash I can spend on it.

1190
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:39,610
Um, can you give me
something to practice with?

1191
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:45,220
And so he sold me a machine,
showed me how to thread the Bobbin,

1192
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:48,550
showed me where it went, pulled through
the needle and I'm like, okay, okay.

1193
01:19:48,970 --> 01:19:53,410
We filmed it so we knew how to do it.
So we're like filming him doing this.

1194
01:19:53,411 --> 01:19:54,160
They're like,
okay.

1195
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,310
So we took the sewing machine and then
I put it in my basement next to the desk

1196
01:19:57,311 --> 01:20:00,370
and I'm like, yeah, it's sewing machine.

1197
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:07,000
And my wife was just like
shaking your head. Luckily,

1198
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:12,090
luckily we had sold a preorder, so we had
sold $40,000 in keys that didn't exist.

1199
01:20:13,950 --> 01:20:16,830
So she had gotten off
my back a little bit.

1200
01:20:18,810 --> 01:20:23,810
So that machinery sat there and as we
looked at trying to like make this key,

1201
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:26,730
and I didn't say, oh, we're going to make
a Gig in America. I just said, right,

1202
01:20:26,731 --> 01:20:28,990
we're going to make,
you were going to change the GE.

1203
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,730
We're going to change
the GE first. So we, um,

1204
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:37,440
we started the import game.
Everybody else is doing it.

1205
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,990
Everybody's telling me
manufacturing's dead.

1206
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,550
I did a few phone calls pretty
much everybody's like, yeah,

1207
01:20:44,551 --> 01:20:47,880
you can't really do that. And
so I was like, okay, you know,

1208
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:53,190
and the whole time I'm thinking like
something's not right here that I can't do

1209
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:59,160
this. And I just couldn't
put my finger on what it was.

1210
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:04,140
So I imported, you know, in 2011 and uh,

1211
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:07,560
may we started in 2011 and into 2012

1212
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:13,160
did a few batches to the whole who
you limited edition batch thing. Geez.

1213
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,530
But we promoted it with
the innovations we had.

1214
01:21:17,720 --> 01:21:21,990
It was still shit. You know when it
comes right down to it, what the g was?

1215
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:26,920
Yeah man, it was still shit. It's
still using old textiles have exist.

1216
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:28,530
So you design the,

1217
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:31,860
well you said you imported one from
Pakistan and then what'd you do?

1218
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:35,430
Like cut it up and redesign it or some
or did you send the design to them and

1219
01:21:35,431 --> 01:21:39,360
they can get of soy? I designed
like a everything in illustrator,

1220
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,150
like a tech pack. Like I want this
here, I want the knee pads here.

1221
01:21:42,151 --> 01:21:43,020
They got to fall here,

1222
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:47,160
the belt loops because I don't want to
untie them all this stuff in and then

1223
01:21:47,300 --> 01:21:52,080
they send it. Yeah. Done. Yeah.
Okay. Finish. So you know,

1224
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:55,040
you know in Pakistan,
um,

1225
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:57,900
they are like the
manufacturing for martial arts.

1226
01:21:57,901 --> 01:22:00,420
It's like the manufacturing hub in
this little city called [inaudible].

1227
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,970
They're actually like a, almost like
migrant workers has a ton of factories,

1228
01:22:05,971 --> 01:22:10,410
Jujitsu factories. But the workers
are the same. All the same guys in,

1229
01:22:10,411 --> 01:22:14,100
they're all the same guys. They meditate
or whatever. Rotate around. Yeah. They,

1230
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,770
we got a contract over here.
We're gonna make, yeah. That's
going to make her, Geez,

1231
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:21,480
good bunch of guys show up there. They
work for pennies and pennies. Yup. Yup.

1232
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:26,510
So we did the important thing
and we started to grow rapidly.

1233
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:30,540
We started to make
money and at that point,

1234
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,980
my other business,

1235
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:35,850
I was making kind of that monthly income
and then I got kind of like a chunk of

1236
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,430
money, like a hundred grand.
I was like, all right, cool.

1237
01:22:39,450 --> 01:22:42,630
I can like take a deep breath
and really push this thing.

1238
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:48,800
And so I pushed it and we
started selling more and more.

1239
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:54,000
Then I came out with this really cool
backpack called the [inaudible] backpack,

1240
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:58,980
jal backpack, technical backpack. And
we sold a ton of them, thousand of them.

1241
01:22:59,370 --> 01:23:02,190
And then we came out with this
product for grip training.

1242
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,980
We weren't patenting anything, we were
just, I was like boom. Cause that's,

1243
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,080
I did like once I got on a roll,
it's like design this, design this.

1244
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,090
And we were just selling,
selling, selling.

1245
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:17,020
And during this time I was
also competing, you know, cause

1246
01:23:19,250 --> 01:23:20,083
a male

1247
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:26,180
no more each Jujitsu and you want to test
yourself against the best in the world.

1248
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:31,960
So I was training hard. I'd
ended up winning the, the, um,

1249
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:33,920
let me,
let me digress for a sec.

1250
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:39,080
I had seen another company release a
product for grip training that looked

1251
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:42,790
exactly like ours.
What was the product though?

1252
01:23:44,010 --> 01:23:47,060
It's called, don't know.
Ring a hang. So it's you,

1253
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:51,950
it's like the g and then color.
It was cool.

1254
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:55,790
It was awesome.
And I was like,

1255
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:58,430
those bastards ripped us off.

1256
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:01,370
And I wasn't thinking my manufacturer
or anything of why I'm psyched man,

1257
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:03,470
another company ripped us off. I
should have patented that, you know,

1258
01:24:03,471 --> 01:24:06,260
Blah Blah Blah.
Okay.

1259
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,550
So I was competing.
I ended up going to Canada.

1260
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:14,480
I won the world pro trials as a brown
belt at the time when the world pro trials

1261
01:24:14,481 --> 01:24:16,740
and the black belt division,
cause they, you know, they,

1262
01:24:16,741 --> 01:24:19,610
they put the divisions
together as you know,

1263
01:24:19,611 --> 01:24:23,960
for that was in 2012 now they, I think
they separated them now again, but,

1264
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:29,860
so I got to go over to Abu Dhabi and
compete in the world pro and as a brown

1265
01:24:31,011 --> 01:24:32,750
belt in that black belt division.

1266
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,440
I'm sitting there before my match and
I'm supposed to fight, uh, Shawn Gee,

1267
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:43,550
how Barrow in the quarter finals
of the open division three.

1268
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:47,990
And I,
I,

1269
01:24:49,340 --> 01:24:52,340
I'm going to say this,
it was bad seating.

1270
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,780
Like the seating of the
brackets was not good. Okay. Um,

1271
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:01,880
like I had in my bracket,
a guy from Brazil,

1272
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:06,350
JT Torres,
a shine g and maybe under a golf ball.

1273
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:10,670
And so JT didn't want to fight,
so he,

1274
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:15,740
so I fought the other kid from Brazil and
he was much smaller and I was athletic

1275
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:16,670
and good and I,

1276
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:22,070
I ended up winning and then JT just
kind of like didn't want to fight.

1277
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:26,780
So then he coached me again, Shawn
and we had a war. It was good man.

1278
01:25:26,781 --> 01:25:31,620
I had last couple of second
span. It was very close. Um,

1279
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:36,140
[inaudible] multiple time
world champion for us.

1280
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:40,340
One of the best of all time
and Jujitsu. Yeah. Big Time.

1281
01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:44,690
Awesome guy too. Awesome. Awesome
guy. So, but the seating was bad.

1282
01:25:44,691 --> 01:25:48,080
Like Lovato wasn't in it. Like there was
a couple of other guys. I don't know,

1283
01:25:48,081 --> 01:25:49,130
just it,

1284
01:25:49,131 --> 01:25:52,070
my division could have been tougher and
I would've gotten my ass kicked a lot

1285
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:55,130
earlier. Okay. So,

1286
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:00,760
but we had a war and it was awesome and
maybe I would have won if I had worked

1287
01:26:01,551 --> 01:26:03,500
harder or maybe I would won

1288
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:05,853
if

1289
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,960
that girl from Poland didn't walk by me
right before the match with an origin

1290
01:26:12,811 --> 01:26:15,330
Gian in a different logo on the back.

1291
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:22,160
And what was on your cut of Biggie?
Like the gay that you designed. Yeah.

1292
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:26,720
And you see a girl from Poland who's
competitive competing. She walks by. Yeah,

1293
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:31,670
it was, it was actually, uh, it was
uh, it was uh, the, the pants. Yeah,

1294
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:35,930
it was a pants or there's a logo different
low on the back. But our whole thing,

1295
01:26:35,931 --> 01:26:38,440
you're designed. Yeah. Look,
have a different logo. Yup.

1296
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:43,760
I knew it was my manufacturer
and then everything clicked.

1297
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,520
They ripped off the
Iranian hand grip trainers.

1298
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,090
Okay.
Okay.

1299
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:53,120
But what am I to do?
Because I'm locked into these guys now,

1300
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:56,360
so I had to strategize.

1301
01:26:57,590 --> 01:27:01,400
So I went out and lost
in the quarter finals,

1302
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:05,960
got on an airplane,
worst freaking flight up my life.

1303
01:27:08,830 --> 01:27:13,720
Cause I'm an Adhd kid and I can't be
stuck in a freaking seat for 14 hours.

1304
01:27:13,721 --> 01:27:14,554
That sucks.

1305
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:22,170
And on the ride back I was talking to JT
who had become good friends with and he

1306
01:27:22,841 --> 01:27:24,940
was kind of like in a
tricky position in life.

1307
01:27:24,941 --> 01:27:29,941
He was still with his instructor and
Maryland and just didn't know kind of what

1308
01:27:30,221 --> 01:27:32,890
to do. He wasn't progressing and
he's, he was telling me like, man,

1309
01:27:32,891 --> 01:27:34,450
I gotta I've got to get,

1310
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:38,830
like I have to do a full workout before
I can actually train with the guys

1311
01:27:38,831 --> 01:27:43,210
because he was so good. He just
wasn't getting it, you know?

1312
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:48,070
And you know, the Mecca of
Jujitsu, you know, is California

1313
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:52,240
ultimately so far as to say San Diego,
San Diego,

1314
01:27:52,241 --> 01:27:54,490
that's where he went to San Diego.
That's where he went.

1315
01:27:54,491 --> 01:27:58,760
So he was figuring his whole thing out.
So cal for sure. Soquel yeah, yeah.

1316
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:03,100
He was fingering his whole thing out.
And Al's I'm thinking about is like this,

1317
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,150
I'm like, man, how I think
I'm gonna build a factory,

1318
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:12,850
I'm more on the airplane as that.
He's looking at me like, oh yeah,

1319
01:28:13,570 --> 01:28:18,520
I want to build a factory, screw
this shit. This is bullshit. I said,

1320
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,320
I'm not competing anymore.
I'm done.

1321
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,210
And all she wanted to do is
win the world championship.

1322
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:26,320
So we kinda like helped each other a
little bit in that plane ride back.

1323
01:28:26,321 --> 01:28:29,620
Like Kinda, you know,
bouncing ideas off each other.

1324
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:33,070
Decompression,
decompression.

1325
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:38,880
So I got back and I skyped my manufacturer

1326
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:44,500
and I was like

1327
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:49,510
over Skype. I'm like, this is bullshit.

1328
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:53,290
You freaking,
I didn't say that.

1329
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:58,410
So you fucking ripped off our intellectual
property and sold it to other brands

1330
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:07,080
and he said, businesses business. Dang,

1331
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:11,430
you ever have a defining moment in your
life where you just turn on and you're

1332
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:13,200
like, Yup, done.

1333
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,730
I knew at that moment and
what we're going to do. Like

1334
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:20,310
it was clear,

1335
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:25,340
it became clear and I knew the challenge
in front of me and I knew it was insane

1336
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,500
and I knew it couldn't be done
and I was like, it's happening.

1337
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:33,360
Props. So, so, uh,

1338
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,870
I got to tell you a little bit
of what happened right after,

1339
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:46,080
right after that I went out to the world
championships to compete because I had

1340
01:29:46,091 --> 01:29:49,960
already signed up
and that was going to be my year.

1341
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:55,370
We were there and there
was this brand there

1342
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:01,960
and I walked up and I walked by an a,
I did a double take. I was like, what?

1343
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,750
And I looked for the right
and there's our Monday,

1344
01:30:04,751 --> 01:30:06,980
I'll technical backpack right there.

1345
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:10,890
But with brand and their logo on it.

1346
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:11,833
Okay.

1347
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:18,590
I went up to the guy and
I was like, dude, I said,

1348
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:22,580
got any original ideas and everybody,

1349
01:30:22,581 --> 01:30:26,060
there's a badass except for
this guy who doesn't do Jujutsu,

1350
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:28,550
who does nothing,
right.

1351
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:33,470
Just some chubby dude who wants to
capitalize on the success of combat sports

1352
01:30:33,471 --> 01:30:37,550
and Jujitsu's growth in California
and I'm not going to name the company.

1353
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:42,500
And I was like, that is
a week. I said, bullshit.

1354
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:48,950
I said, get some original
frigging ideas. I went down,

1355
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:51,860
walked down and myself and uh,
the Deco,

1356
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:56,950
our business partner and his wife and my
wife were down there and I told my wife

1357
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:02,660
in spin,
did she ever,

1358
01:31:04,160 --> 01:31:08,930
she went up there and she
flipped out on the guy.

1359
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:10,760
If Amanda bringing it,

1360
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,800
she bringing it five
to 103 pounds of fury,

1361
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:20,240
French Canadian re fury.
Done. It was awesome.

1362
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:25,730
We flew back and the
picture was already clear.

1363
01:31:25,731 --> 01:31:30,170
This was just like added motivation,
just added motivation.

1364
01:31:31,730 --> 01:31:32,930
I called one of my buddies,
Tim,

1365
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:37,970
and and John was already working
for me from my last business,

1366
01:31:38,420 --> 01:31:41,360
the sole survivor,
sole survivor moved back to Farmington.

1367
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:45,210
What we did is we grab that,

1368
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:49,740
like that tape you put around trees
and you want to flag trees to cut main,

1369
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:53,130
you've got to flag the trees to cut.
And we Kinda, I'm like, all right John,

1370
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:56,280
I have seven acres of property,
which is okay, listen,

1371
01:31:56,281 --> 01:31:59,470
seven acres is not a lot of
property in Maine, right?

1372
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,670
You can buy property in Maine for $500
an acre in some places, private sale.

1373
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:07,120
So let's just make that clear.
Seven acres is not a lot,

1374
01:32:09,570 --> 01:32:14,280
but we have seven acres of land in
the woods and so I like flagged out,

1375
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,620
I'm like,
we're going to build a factory here.

1376
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,640
We just flagged it out like this.

1377
01:32:20,730 --> 01:32:23,760
And this is based on the architectural
design that your engineered put new for

1378
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:25,840
your factory. Yeah. Right.

1379
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:32,100
I think a factory should be about this
big. Yeah, this looks like a factory.

1380
01:32:32,101 --> 01:32:33,990
His eyes so awesome.

1381
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:38,630
And he brought his chains are over
and they're just like, all right,

1382
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:42,730
let's just do it. And we just, rat rat,
rat rat just started cutting trees.

1383
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:46,330
My father in law came over with a chipper.
We chipped it out.

1384
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,930
Okay. We stumped it.
Would pull the stumps out.

1385
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,000
We're pretty resourceful
up in here in May.

1386
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:56,860
He ever had a Yankee ingenuity that term
for sure.

1387
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:01,450
That happens.
So what do we do?

1388
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:05,200
We cleared it.
We did a little bit of earthwork.

1389
01:33:05,500 --> 01:33:10,330
I got on the Compact and compact
at all the sand and poured a slab.

1390
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:13,540
Had had some, some guy, some company,

1391
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,600
a Sar out a bunch of eastern
white pine and had my buddy build,

1392
01:33:19,570 --> 01:33:22,360
build a barn,
factory barn.

1393
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:27,360
And we just spent, I don't
know, eight 16 eight hour,

1394
01:33:27,370 --> 01:33:30,340
how many hours you slept and
zero hours around the clock.

1395
01:33:30,341 --> 01:33:34,840
We just built this thing from the
ground up myself, my brother, friends,

1396
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:37,360
family that would just,
we did it. We built it.

1397
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:39,790
Sure that we stuck a sewing machine.

1398
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,040
So when you see that $200 were like,

1399
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:49,300
what are we doing? That's where it began.
And, and we, you know, the thing is,

1400
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:53,710
is like if you listen,
I'm, I'm all for planning.

1401
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:54,983
Aye.

1402
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,110
Yeah.

1403
01:33:56,110 --> 01:34:00,760
I like to plan the, what's going to
happen in that. I like to, like you say,

1404
01:34:00,761 --> 01:34:02,650
execute it.
I like to execute that plan,

1405
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:08,430
but do it and I like to
lead the plan and I'm,

1406
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:11,890
I'm shitty when it comes to like,

1407
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:15,610
I'm always making sure everybody's
living up to their expectations.

1408
01:34:15,611 --> 01:34:19,450
Like as part of the plan, if they bought
into it, you better fully bought into it.

1409
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:23,010
There's no room for like slacking.
Like if I'm working till midnight,

1410
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:26,290
you're work until midnight,
right? You're not leaving.

1411
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:31,300
So that's what we did. And I'm a
pusher to you, like a push, push, push.

1412
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:35,290
I like to see how much I can get out of
somebody to push them to their potential

1413
01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:38,800
and see where their breaking point
is so I can learn about the person,

1414
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:43,360
but also get the best out of them.
So we did it.

1415
01:34:43,361 --> 01:34:45,910
We built a factory and uh,

1416
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,553
yeah,

1417
01:34:48,820 --> 01:34:53,400
that's where it started. So then comes
what, what's next? Sewing machines. Yeah.

1418
01:34:53,590 --> 01:34:55,420
And sewing machines and some,

1419
01:34:55,470 --> 01:34:58,040
as you started looking for
staff that knew how sell, yeah,

1420
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,740
exactly.
So we didn't have any lights yet.

1421
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:03,820
We had one sewing machine and we just
like, okay, this is how we're going.

1422
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:05,210
This is how you,
so,

1423
01:35:05,950 --> 01:35:09,650
and I found this old timer bill who
came down and he's like explaining the

1424
01:35:09,651 --> 01:35:10,191
different types.

1425
01:35:10,191 --> 01:35:14,750
He's been in the business for 40 years
fixing sewing machines and he's just like,

1426
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:17,090
you know when his accent, he's like, oh,

1427
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:21,230
you got the single needle machine and a
double needle when you've got a locking

1428
01:35:21,231 --> 01:35:25,340
stitch in a chain stitch and you know
all this stuff. And I'm just like, whoa.

1429
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:27,460
And so I just absorbed,

1430
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:31,730
he became completely
absorbed in that right?

1431
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:37,490
Learning about sewing machines. I learned
how to, how to run them, how to fix them,

1432
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:41,480
what they were good for, the
different types of feeding, you know,

1433
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:44,090
all everything about sewing
machines. I was like, cool.

1434
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:46,520
I know about sewing machines
now we need some fabric.

1435
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,890
So I started looking for fabric.
Guess what?

1436
01:35:54,330 --> 01:35:55,830
They don't make fabric.

1437
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:57,210
Yeah.

1438
01:35:57,210 --> 01:35:58,620
In the United States,

1439
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,510
they don't make fabric
that we needed in Mexico.

1440
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:06,090
They don't make fabric in Canada.
Shit,

1441
01:36:06,091 --> 01:36:09,840
they don't make fabric for Jujitsu ease.
And I was like,

1442
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:14,610
what are we going to do?
What would you do?

1443
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:21,440
You just built a factory and you
have all these sewing machines in,

1444
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,480
what would you do?
So you,

1445
01:36:24,481 --> 01:36:28,380
so your only option at this point is got
to order the material from the order,

1446
01:36:28,381 --> 01:36:31,050
the material from overseas. You got it.
That's what you're going to do. Right.

1447
01:36:32,430 --> 01:36:33,450
I was like screw that.

1448
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:38,280
And so I started looking for like
weaving and so I just, you know,

1449
01:36:38,281 --> 01:36:40,830
it was looking for weaving
like hey, hey, hey you guys,

1450
01:36:40,831 --> 01:36:44,490
we've can you use a fire forest? Yeah.
A hundred thousand yards, you know,

1451
01:36:44,491 --> 01:36:48,690
12 bucks a yard. No. So

1452
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:55,200
I'm just looking, looking,
looking, looking, and did
you ever order any material?

1453
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:59,070
I did. Okay. Because you had to sell
gies. I mean you had to make some money.

1454
01:36:59,071 --> 01:37:02,420
You got to investment into this
thing now. Right. And I did, I had,

1455
01:37:02,421 --> 01:37:07,170
I didn't pick it. Take a paycheck for
like the first two years of business.

1456
01:37:07,171 --> 01:37:09,060
I didn't take a paycheck,
maybe three.

1457
01:37:09,630 --> 01:37:13,440
I didn't pay myself once every dime.
I just dumped back in,

1458
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,670
dumped back in dumped back in

1459
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:22,230
weaving was impossible. Right.
You're not in a freaking we material.

1460
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:23,820
So I did,

1461
01:37:23,821 --> 01:37:28,821
I imported material for
that first year and we,

1462
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:33,750
we figured out how to make a g
and it was a pain in the ass.

1463
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,730
And that first week,

1464
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:42,550
well we finished the week and I called
to deco and I said we made five pairs of

1465
01:37:45,261 --> 01:37:50,140
pants this week
and he's like,

1466
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:54,420
really high production dude. I
was just like, what am I doing?

1467
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:59,370
And I kind of start telling that story.
You like legit, we're questioning.

1468
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:02,650
Oh I spiraled down like,
oh my God, you didn't,

1469
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:06,030
you thought you were going to make 200
g's in a week and he or de Pants and

1470
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,540
weekend you make five,
five, five pairs of pants.

1471
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:15,660
I was just mind boggling,
mind boggling.

1472
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:17,940
And Jill was my first teacher.
She's still with us today.

1473
01:38:17,941 --> 01:38:22,260
The one you were talking
about earlier. Yeah, dude,

1474
01:38:22,261 --> 01:38:26,880
I did not know what to do.
I was truly at a loss for,

1475
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:28,500
I didn't have anybody do.

1476
01:38:28,501 --> 01:38:33,300
They teach me about how to manufacturer,

1477
01:38:33,301 --> 01:38:38,301
like how you should set this up because
the knowledge had disappeared out of the

1478
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:43,230
state. It was gone. The folks
that used to do that stuff,

1479
01:38:43,231 --> 01:38:47,400
either they've passed or there
they've moved on, they're snowbirds,

1480
01:38:47,401 --> 01:38:48,930
they moved to Florida,
whatever, they weren't around.

1481
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:56,690
So I had a lot of late nights
by myself in my basement

1482
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:00,770
with a glass of whiskey.

1483
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:11,550
I started to have that feeling come
back of that like failure feeling and

1484
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:19,870
I didn't know what to do as like

1485
01:39:21,610 --> 01:39:26,530
what did I get myself into, you
know, like what, what are you doing?

1486
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:29,380
Like how do you,
what am I doing?

1487
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:38,310
And then I figured like
I cannot

1488
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:44,250
basically like I can't do
this alone type of situation.

1489
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:48,410
And in a conversation with my
father in law's like Joe, man,

1490
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:53,420
I need to talk to somebody who's like
been there and done that and like done,

1491
01:39:53,730 --> 01:39:56,670
built something from nothing.
And he's like pds. Like,

1492
01:39:56,671 --> 01:40:01,020
I've got a friend that he did some work
for in his bulldozer by and finalize a

1493
01:40:01,021 --> 01:40:03,450
heavy macra repair machinery mechanic.

1494
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:08,820
And so we made a phone call to this
guy, John, I'll leave his last name out.

1495
01:40:10,230 --> 01:40:14,760
And John said, yeah, I'll
meet with Pete. He said,

1496
01:40:14,761 --> 01:40:17,130
here's the date and time.
Meet me at my Lake House.

1497
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:23,850
So I showed up at his Lake House and I
sat down and he shook my hand and he said,

1498
01:40:24,630 --> 01:40:29,190
let me tell you something,
you're not fucking special.

1499
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:30,990
Now I'm already Pete down.

1500
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:36,540
Just I'm using his words and
you're not fucking special.

1501
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,340
Your ideas aren't special
and nobody gives a shit.

1502
01:40:43,940 --> 01:40:47,790
How's that? Okay. Motivational
speaker getting after it.

1503
01:40:47,791 --> 01:40:52,430
You nobody gives a shit. Yup. I said
reality check. Yeah. I was like,

1504
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:56,590
Oh shit. He goes, what's your problem?

1505
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,980
I said, man, Aye. Aye. We need money
to like, he was like, no you don't.

1506
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:08,470
I said, no, we need, we need, we
need money to, to like do this,

1507
01:41:08,471 --> 01:41:11,620
to like learn how to do this and
build this and like make this happen.

1508
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:13,030
I need money.
The capital.

1509
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,511
He goes,

1510
01:41:15,511 --> 01:41:19,110
Pete w were you in the back of your mind
thinking you had good capital investor

1511
01:41:19,111 --> 01:41:20,910
right here is a big gala,
the lake house,

1512
01:41:20,911 --> 01:41:25,290
and maybe this guy's going
to throw to tgs at, you know,

1513
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:29,080
nope,
I wasn't there for financial,

1514
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:34,620
uh, financial, uh, I wasn't looking,
but that was the solution that you saw.

1515
01:41:34,680 --> 01:41:37,530
You didn't come from him. You just
thought, I need money for this thing,

1516
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:38,550
only solution.

1517
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:41,303
I need money.

1518
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:46,080
And as he kind of like beat me down

1519
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:51,300
and this guy ran like a 50 [inaudible],
I think they're $100 million company now.

1520
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:55,650
At that point it was $50 million and he
was kind of retired and doing his thing

1521
01:41:56,190 --> 01:42:01,190
and giving his time to me for free to
help another kid from industry main

1522
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:02,873
succeed.

1523
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:11,200
He basically educated me in two hours,

1524
01:42:11,481 --> 01:42:16,481
educated me and I walked away from
that meeting like with a plan,

1525
01:42:17,990 --> 01:42:20,630
a plan of action. What
was like, what was the,

1526
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:25,660
the big takeaways he told me I need to
basically find out who I was and do a

1527
01:42:27,650 --> 01:42:31,100
personality profile.
Uh,

1528
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:36,760
and he goes, you're
probably what he say. N,

1529
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:40,880
I, N, f, j, something like
that. He like guessed it.

1530
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,680
Um, or an I an Ega. I'm not
even exactly sure what it was.

1531
01:42:45,681 --> 01:42:50,630
So I did my personality profile to find
out my strengths and weaknesses and it

1532
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:54,410
was spot on. I was like, Holy
Shit, this is added like crazy.

1533
01:42:54,860 --> 01:42:58,160
And uh,
then he told me,

1534
01:42:59,330 --> 01:43:00,800
you're not all in,

1535
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:07,430
you don't really want to win at this.

1536
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:12,230
I was like, no, I do. Then go all
in. How much do you believe in it?

1537
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:14,480
Because there's a million
frigging people like you.

1538
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:20,320
He said there's a million people like
you and a million great ideas and less

1539
01:43:20,901 --> 01:43:25,901
than 1% are willing to go and
chase it and go all in and do it.

1540
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:32,960
Are you one of those
people and if you are,

1541
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:37,130
solve the money problem and
solve the rest of the problems.

1542
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:44,350
The next day I was at the bank signing
my home away with my wife by my side.

1543
01:43:46,190 --> 01:43:50,000
She was stoked for a $200,000 loan.

1544
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:55,190
That was tougher.
Her two things as you were saying them,

1545
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:59,090
there's a big difference.
You put them together,

1546
01:43:59,091 --> 01:44:04,070
which is when you put them together,
it makes sense. But chasing your goals,

1547
01:44:04,071 --> 01:44:08,570
chasing your dream and being
all in does not in the same,

1548
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:12,400
not the same things. Now, now if you're
all in and did, you have to chase it. You,

1549
01:44:12,401 --> 01:44:14,540
you don't even know what else
to do besides chase it. Right.

1550
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:18,950
But I think some people, they, they chase
it, but they're running like half speed.

1551
01:44:18,970 --> 01:44:23,840
Yep. And I was a half speed. Yeah, it's
awesome. You gotta be uncomfortable.

1552
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:27,440
That's basically what I took away from
that. And he's the one that told me,

1553
01:44:27,441 --> 01:44:30,580
he said, Pete, how old are you? I said,

1554
01:44:30,581 --> 01:44:35,560
I'm 30 what's your problem?
I said,

1555
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,350
I'm going to get John on the podcast
at some point. I'm stuck. Yeah. I said,

1556
01:44:41,351 --> 01:44:42,760
I was stuck.
He goes,

1557
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:50,110
you got three more chances. He's like,
I'm 60 you got three more chances.

1558
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:55,450
He's like, if you believe in it. And he's
the one that told me everything in life.

1559
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:58,780
Everything great takes 10 years to build,

1560
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:04,180
go build it and be committed because
it's got to take 10 years to build it.

1561
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:06,910
But if you believe in it,

1562
01:45:07,390 --> 01:45:11,920
you have to go all in and if
you got to put up your house,

1563
01:45:11,921 --> 01:45:16,060
put up your house,
you'll work your way out of it eventually.

1564
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:17,253
So that's what I did.

1565
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:21,430
I followed his advice and I went all in.

1566
01:45:23,020 --> 01:45:26,980
He also told me, the moment
you stop growing, you die.

1567
01:45:28,030 --> 01:45:31,210
He said, if you stop
growing, you will die.

1568
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:36,570
The moment you want to do something
different than what you're doing,

1569
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:42,110
the moment your mind wanders to
wanting to be somewhere else,

1570
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,580
your business also dies

1571
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:49,900
and you need to recognize that.

1572
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,810
And that first meeting with him was just,
it just changed my,

1573
01:45:56,500 --> 01:46:00,070
changed my game and when I
signed my name on that loan,

1574
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:04,630
when I signed my home to the
bank to receive that check,

1575
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,470
I was laser focused.

1576
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:15,560
It's like being in the woods on an early
morning hunt when it's dark and the sun

1577
01:46:17,190 --> 01:46:22,190
is coming up in the and the and the and
the leaves go right as the sun hits the

1578
01:46:22,771 --> 01:46:23,850
leaves,
it's the trees

1579
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:29,400
and you're waiting right for the deer,
for whatever you're hunting.

1580
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:35,130
That's what I felt like about business.
The same feeling you get from that.

1581
01:46:35,490 --> 01:46:40,490
I felt laser focused and it's like
everything just opened up like my mind

1582
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:48,180
opened, like the synopsis connected
and I was at like a new Pr,

1583
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,470
a nuance.
I was noo.

1584
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,580
That's what I mean by like you can't
hear when was born an entrepreneur.

1585
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:59,750
You're not born an entrepreneur.
You need to get punched in the face.

1586
01:47:00,260 --> 01:47:03,320
And John Punched me right in the nose.
It was awesome.

1587
01:47:07,050 --> 01:47:09,510
So the next step is

1588
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:14,010
you order some material, but that's
not your longterm plan. Right? And,

1589
01:47:14,230 --> 01:47:17,950
and the next thing you do is you go,
we got to make this material more skills.

1590
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:19,420
We've got to make the material.

1591
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:26,210
I had called every use textile
company in the United States,

1592
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:31,580
every use textile company to
try and find this machinery.

1593
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:35,670
We had to weave our own fabric.

1594
01:47:36,780 --> 01:47:40,110
It wasn't a sustainable model
without waiving our own fabric.

1595
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:45,930
They're all like, it's just
not going to happen. I'm like,

1596
01:47:45,931 --> 01:47:50,490
what is it to get set up million dollars,
right?

1597
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,050
750 grand.

1598
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:58,670
This is to buy a brand new loses the by
Lou, the operational experience in there.

1599
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:01,190
And they're going to send you from the
factory after they build this loom,

1600
01:48:01,191 --> 01:48:03,800
they'll send you a guy that's going to
help you run it all set up is that we

1601
01:48:03,801 --> 01:48:05,420
just need $1 million. Yeah, exactly.

1602
01:48:07,660 --> 01:48:10,810
It's just not going to
happen. So I was like, okay,

1603
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:16,480
in business it's like boxing.
Like it's like Jujitsu.

1604
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:21,010
It's all about the angles. You know when
people get so stuck on like one angle,

1605
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:25,720
they could only see that one angle and I
just had to like I the step to the side

1606
01:48:25,721 --> 01:48:27,220
and I had to see this angle.

1607
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:33,220
I knew Maine had a heritage and weaving.

1608
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:38,940
I knew there was weaving here at one
point and so I went back to that same old

1609
01:48:39,341 --> 01:48:40,151
timer in Lewiston,

1610
01:48:40,151 --> 01:48:45,040
Maine who had sold me my first sewing
machine and I sat in his office and I

1611
01:48:45,041 --> 01:48:48,730
said, no, where there aren't any looms.

1612
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,590
It's like, what do you mean?
I'm like a weaving loom,

1613
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:58,540
like to weave fabric. He
goes, get in my truck.

1614
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,020
I get in his truck,

1615
01:49:02,440 --> 01:49:07,440
we drive up one street and get
out and this is massive building.

1616
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:09,483
It's like,
uh,

1617
01:49:09,550 --> 01:49:13,660
I think total square footage was
like 1.5 million square feet low,

1618
01:49:13,661 --> 01:49:18,661
mostly abandoned a few businesses in
the front that they've refurbished

1619
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:22,060
and there's a museum there

1620
01:49:24,330 --> 01:49:28,860
and in walks in and he introduces me
to this woman Rachel, and he says,

1621
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:32,790
Rachel, this is Pete.
He's looking for a loom.

1622
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:37,620
And she goes, well, follow me.

1623
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,110
She made me sign a release.

1624
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:45,630
We went up the stairs and into this
old mill five and the floorboards,

1625
01:49:46,050 --> 01:49:48,100
the windows were all broken.
The sawtooth building,

1626
01:49:48,101 --> 01:49:51,370
you know the saw tooth mill buildings
and windows were all broken and the wood

1627
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:55,870
was all punky and like,
like all bent up and splintered.

1628
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:57,370
You had like watch where you're walking

1629
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:04,210
and there's this big green nasty thing
sitting in the middle of the floor right

1630
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:09,070
there in this whole place. And
we walk over to it. She's like,

1631
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:14,280
I need to get rid of this.
And I'm like, this is a whom

1632
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:19,960
he, she's like, Yup. I said, Holy Shit.

1633
01:50:24,120 --> 01:50:28,490
Where's the rest of them?
They shipped them overseas.

1634
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,070
Company in India bought us,

1635
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:34,760
bought about automile and they shipped
everything overseas and she goes,

1636
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:39,200
I kept this one. I kept it here because
I wanted to put it in the museum,

1637
01:50:39,201 --> 01:50:42,740
so we didn't lose our heritage day.

1638
01:50:43,820 --> 01:50:48,560
I said, can I buy it? And she
said, Yep. I said, how much?

1639
01:50:48,561 --> 01:50:53,150
She had 3000 bucks. I
said, okay, done men,

1640
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:57,430
and this is it. Like I just want
to point this out. The the, the,

1641
01:50:57,590 --> 01:51:00,080
the floor is all broken.

1642
01:51:00,081 --> 01:51:03,560
The windows are broken and the
loom is like rusty, right? Oh Dude,

1643
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:08,120
this is not like this. This
thing is disaster. When's
the last time it was used?

1644
01:51:08,121 --> 01:51:12,590
How many years ago? Oh, eighties it was,

1645
01:51:12,591 --> 01:51:16,400
it's an 83 it's like a 1983 I don't
know when the last time it was used,

1646
01:51:16,401 --> 01:51:19,760
but it hadn't been, had any
love for a long, long time.

1647
01:51:20,420 --> 01:51:23,060
Most of the parts were stripped off of it.
It was like a frame,

1648
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:27,470
just like an infrastructure.
I said, okay, I'll buy it.

1649
01:51:27,710 --> 01:51:29,060
I'm going to buy this loom.

1650
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:34,310
Yeah.

1651
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:38,870
So you've got to be a little bit naive
to be in business and think you can

1652
01:51:38,871 --> 01:51:42,500
accomplish anything. That's the
bottom line. And I was pretty,

1653
01:51:42,590 --> 01:51:47,590
pretty driven and naive to think
that we could weave fabric,

1654
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:51,170
but I believe that we could.

1655
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:59,340
So she sold me it and then I called my
father in law and I said, I got a loom,

1656
01:52:00,120 --> 01:52:04,440
it's on the third floor of
this old mill in Lewiston,

1657
01:52:04,441 --> 01:52:07,590
Maine and we need to get it out.

1658
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:12,840
And I got a quote on moving in and it
was $25,000 to move it. And I'm like,

1659
01:52:12,841 --> 01:52:17,280
we're gonna move it. And he's like, okay.

1660
01:52:18,180 --> 01:52:21,030
So I've got a bunch of friends.
We went up there,

1661
01:52:21,630 --> 01:52:23,970
took nine guys,

1662
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:28,440
eight hours to move it from the middle
of the floor to the edge of the building.

1663
01:52:30,330 --> 01:52:31,163
And we

1664
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:36,240
had another friend who had a crane and
we ended up getting it out and onto a

1665
01:52:36,241 --> 01:52:39,060
trailer and put it in the factory.

1666
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:43,770
And then we were like,
why are we do dear?

1667
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:47,990
And it was awesome.
It was awesome.

1668
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:51,140
So that's where it started.
Uh,

1669
01:52:53,060 --> 01:52:55,490
you know, it's, I always believe like

1670
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:01,800
if it was done, it can
be done. Like if it, if,

1671
01:53:01,860 --> 01:53:04,140
if you know,
in Maine we have this thing,

1672
01:53:04,141 --> 01:53:07,560
like main at one point was 90% field.

1673
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,610
How to become 90% fields, you
know, a hundred years ago.

1674
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:15,840
Hands and daylight,
hands in daylight, right.

1675
01:53:15,870 --> 01:53:19,920
How were these mill buildings built?
Hands and daylight. That's it.

1676
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,570
These people they got
after it. I mean, why?

1677
01:53:24,990 --> 01:53:28,800
Because if you don't, you die.
That's it. You're going to die.

1678
01:53:29,640 --> 01:53:32,070
So you've got to farm,
you've got to know how to build a house.

1679
01:53:32,100 --> 01:53:33,210
You got to know how to start a fire.

1680
01:53:33,450 --> 01:53:38,340
Like that culture of New
England is still rich,

1681
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:42,060
you know, it's still passed down.
We burn wood. Everybody Burns.

1682
01:53:42,061 --> 01:53:46,530
Would we build our own shit, you know,
houses, everything. That's what we do.

1683
01:53:46,890 --> 01:53:51,840
Why is everybody saying
we can't manufacture? We
can't. We've, we can't cut.

1684
01:53:51,841 --> 01:53:56,480
And so that's bullshit. If
they did it, we can do it.

1685
01:53:56,481 --> 01:53:57,900
Cause they did it with a lot less.

1686
01:54:01,610 --> 01:54:06,250
I found a guy, Lenny,
when that mill shut down,

1687
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:11,590
he had a contract to go over to um,
Pakistan,

1688
01:54:11,890 --> 01:54:13,930
Pakistan of all places

1689
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:19,760
to teach them how to run the
looms that were purchased

1690
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:27,970
in a month later was nine 11 and
he didn't go and he stayed here,

1691
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:33,410
thank God because he's the last,

1692
01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:39,610
he's like the last one left that can
actually get this thing going and make it

1693
01:54:41,091 --> 01:54:41,924
work again.

1694
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:48,320
I asked [inaudible] how many
people know what you know?

1695
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:52,700
He said a whole bunch. I said,
well, what's a whole bunch?

1696
01:54:52,701 --> 01:54:57,380
She's like five.
So he,

1697
01:54:57,381 --> 01:55:02,381
Lenny passes knowledge on US weaving
pattern making for textiles and all this

1698
01:55:04,671 --> 01:55:05,504
stuff.

1699
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:10,310
And that's a whole nother
story maybe for different time.

1700
01:55:11,270 --> 01:55:16,270
But we started weaving fabric
and we became vertically
integrated and we started

1701
01:55:16,521 --> 01:55:19,790
making the product from raw cotton from
what did it feel like the first time

1702
01:55:19,791 --> 01:55:23,910
that thing created? Created
like fabric. You must've dude.

1703
01:55:23,980 --> 01:55:27,590
He was freaked out. We were
just like, he's just like, uh,

1704
01:55:28,940 --> 01:55:32,810
we had the, we had like the pack, like we
had to make Pearl we've, and so we did,

1705
01:55:32,811 --> 01:55:33,261
we made pro,

1706
01:55:33,261 --> 01:55:38,261
we would like took the up pro we've apart
that was like from the imported fabric

1707
01:55:38,361 --> 01:55:42,080
is like we just picked it apart and
Lenny looked at it and figuring out what

1708
01:55:42,380 --> 01:55:45,120
size threat, you know, yarns
and the weight and everything.

1709
01:55:45,121 --> 01:55:49,230
So we just recreated it and he
turned it on for the first time.

1710
01:55:50,030 --> 01:55:54,960
You know how long it took to clean
that thing, 40 man hours to clean it.

1711
01:55:55,790 --> 01:55:58,470
Like it just, it need cleaning
before we did anything cleaning,

1712
01:55:58,600 --> 01:55:59,520
then we had the buy it,

1713
01:55:59,521 --> 01:56:02,880
all the parts are out of a machine
and just to get it going again.

1714
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:06,600
He turned it off for the
first time and it was like,

1715
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:08,313
well,

1716
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:17,660
and I looked at John, my employee,
John and Lenny and I said,

1717
01:56:17,661 --> 01:56:20,750
Holy Shit.
And then,

1718
01:56:23,070 --> 01:56:27,170
and there comes and it's just, and there's
a pearl. We've coming off the loom,

1719
01:56:27,830 --> 01:56:31,430
man, it was so exciting. I was
like, nobody's ever done this.

1720
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,990
Nobody's ever done this.
And it was,

1721
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:41,030
I was super proud. I was like, we're,
we're fricking doing it. We are doing it.

1722
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:43,340
And then we announced it to the world.

1723
01:56:43,760 --> 01:56:48,320
We thought we still got a
lot of work to do, but, uh,

1724
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:50,810
now we announced it to the Jujitsu world.

1725
01:56:54,460 --> 01:56:55,680
That's it, man. That was it.

1726
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,020
How do I even want to tell you
the challenges after weaving?

1727
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:02,880
I do color this though. Sold,
like I was telling you before,

1728
01:57:02,881 --> 01:57:06,130
when, when I was in this SQL
teams in the early nineties, yeah,

1729
01:57:06,330 --> 01:57:09,240
we didn't have the custom gear,
right?

1730
01:57:09,241 --> 01:57:13,420
You couldn't buy this stuff
on the Internet from these
tactical companies. Right?

1731
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:17,160
So we made stuff and we had,
we had parachute riggers,

1732
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,230
which are the people that pack parachutes,

1733
01:57:19,231 --> 01:57:23,910
but in a parachute loft you've got a nice
medium duty and sometimes a heavy duty

1734
01:57:23,911 --> 01:57:27,780
sewing machine. And so we would
make our own gear and, and us guys,

1735
01:57:27,781 --> 01:57:31,490
like we would kind of get into it a
little bit and I, you know, I had us,

1736
01:57:31,491 --> 01:57:34,380
a lot of seals would have
their own, um, you know,

1737
01:57:34,381 --> 01:57:36,630
sewing machines and you know,

1738
01:57:36,631 --> 01:57:38,760
you'd make gear and some
people would be good at it.

1739
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:43,680
Some people get really good at it.
And I was not one of those people and it,

1740
01:57:43,950 --> 01:57:44,870
because,
you know,

1741
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,700
there's these little threads and you
got to get these things working right.

1742
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:52,860
The fifth bullet through the,
because all this stuff. Yeah. And so,

1743
01:57:52,950 --> 01:57:56,580
and every time I'd like to start
sewing it would just fall apart.

1744
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,890
Or like a bird's nest and just mayhem.

1745
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:03,240
And when I see like the loom,
yeah.

1746
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:05,670
With it looks like stress you out.

1747
01:58:05,671 --> 01:58:10,030
1 billion is coming through
these little things and,

1748
01:58:10,031 --> 01:58:11,160
and therefore wing through.

1749
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:13,920
And then you look on the other
side and all that craziness.

1750
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:17,070
There's like these hundreds of thousands,

1751
01:58:17,071 --> 01:58:19,960
it looks like little pins that are
moving and things that are pulling apart.

1752
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:23,070
It's crazy. And then it comes up you
other side and you see this pattern. Yeah.

1753
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:27,470
And He makes me, it actually does
stress. Yeah, I see it. I go, man, I,

1754
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:29,820
I can't be in here for two logs.
I'm freaking out.

1755
01:58:29,821 --> 01:58:33,390
Just thinking if I get too close
to these things, oh yeah. My,

1756
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:38,340
my presence will cause disturbances in
the forest and things will go wrong.

1757
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:43,120
I'm not allowed to be in there for very
long. I like, I'm not, I'm, I've got to,

1758
01:58:43,121 --> 01:58:47,380
I've got an issue, you know, a
subliminal issue with threads.

1759
01:58:47,950 --> 01:58:52,030
And so I keep, I even today I said keeping
a little distance from the machines.

1760
01:58:52,270 --> 01:58:57,040
I don't want to foul him up. You guys have
the magic, like stayed away from that.

1761
01:58:57,250 --> 01:59:01,180
But yet to see that and, and to even
imagine it like, you know, again,

1762
01:59:01,330 --> 01:59:04,270
as a novice person working with
a sewing machine as a young kid,

1763
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:09,310
the how hard it was for me to do it. And
then like I was watching Julietta Wham,

1764
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:14,260
wham, Wham, just hammering, you're
just, it's like such a good craft,

1765
01:59:14,261 --> 01:59:16,240
such good skill to have and,

1766
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:19,840
and just to see the loom and all those
different parts, you're saying yourself.

1767
01:59:19,900 --> 01:59:24,850
Well for one thing like good luck, like
somebody wants to do what we're doing.

1768
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:29,060
Go. Yeah, do it. You have fun
with that one. Not Happening.

1769
01:59:29,410 --> 01:59:33,790
But by the way we bought the
last loom switch. You're screwed.

1770
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:38,720
Yeah, absolutely. And the last
bit of knowledge with six,

1771
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:43,480
which exists. Yeah man.
And so then you know,

1772
01:59:43,780 --> 01:59:44,141
you,

1773
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:47,650
you take and you start weaving it and
now you starting to sell gies and how's

1774
01:59:47,651 --> 01:59:48,580
business going now?

1775
01:59:48,581 --> 01:59:53,581
Now you're able to put on something
made in the USA 100% and that's from the

1776
01:59:54,461 --> 01:59:58,870
dirt to the shirt. Yeah. Code
Rod rod already dirt to shirt.

1777
01:59:59,170 --> 01:59:59,830
Right.

1778
01:59:59,830 --> 02:00:04,830
I mean because field to finish because
the cotton is coming from Tennessee Delta

1779
02:00:05,861 --> 02:00:10,480
region, Tennessee spun in the
Carolinas and shipped up to us.

1780
02:00:10,810 --> 02:00:13,210
That's like the,
that's old school fricken right.

1781
02:00:13,211 --> 02:00:17,920
It is the way it's supposed to work.
Hats, old school making shit. You know.

1782
02:00:17,950 --> 02:00:18,783
I mean

1783
02:00:21,410 --> 02:00:23,990
I talked today a little bit at
our grand opening about like

1784
02:00:25,380 --> 02:00:26,213
Mainers

1785
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,800
generations of folks that put their
hands on something right there makers,

1786
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:39,690
they need to make something in.

1787
02:00:39,691 --> 02:00:44,610
They're trying to cross train
these people to type on a computer,

1788
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:45,953
you know,

1789
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:50,010
do mundane office type of tasks,
filing papers,

1790
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:51,780
answering the phone and call centers.

1791
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:55,470
These people want to make shit.

1792
02:00:55,890 --> 02:01:00,890
We're known in Maine for being some of
the best crafts people in the world.

1793
02:01:01,980 --> 02:01:05,550
The products that come from Maine or
some of the best products in the world.

1794
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:13,300
And to be part of
resurrecting that heritage is,

1795
02:01:13,480 --> 02:01:18,160
it's incredible, you know, and it
is our ultimate mission, you know,

1796
02:01:18,161 --> 02:01:22,360
to resurrect our heritage in manufacturing

1797
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:27,260
and build old world level quality the

1798
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:30,640
products and stand behind it,

1799
02:01:32,380 --> 02:01:36,850
stitch every, stitch, every,

1800
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:38,830
every yarn in the,

1801
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:41,390
and that's what we're all about.

1802
02:01:41,510 --> 02:01:46,510
And that's what origins stands for with
a little bit more modern look and feel.

1803
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:54,310
But sourcing and manufacturing
100% in the u s and I,

1804
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:59,630
we won't compromise on that at ever.

1805
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:05,390
Like other companies do when
they get greedy and they say,

1806
02:02:05,391 --> 02:02:07,790
well,
it's time to look at the numbers.

1807
02:02:07,791 --> 02:02:12,710
It's time to increase the margins and we
got to import some of this stuff. Nope,

1808
02:02:13,700 --> 02:02:17,210
we're not. We're just not doing
it. It's just not happening.

1809
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:23,680
I was in at bath iron
works for the awesome,

1810
02:02:23,901 --> 02:02:26,450
the Christening of the
USS Michael Mont store,

1811
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:29,360
obviously named after Michael Monster War.

1812
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:32,210
And it was awesome for me. You know, I,

1813
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:37,250
I enlisted in the navy from that down
in Portland and to come back 26 years

1814
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:45,530
later and see what you're talking about,

1815
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:49,850
what I knew existed in
New England in Maine and,

1816
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:53,670
and seeing the pride that these,
you know,

1817
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,270
ship builders,

1818
02:02:56,020 --> 02:03:01,020
the iron workers that did the pride that
they took in that ship named after a

1819
02:03:02,570 --> 02:03:06,010
saint of a human being.
And you know,

1820
02:03:06,020 --> 02:03:11,020
that's one of the things that I tied to
origin cause I knew what you were doing

1821
02:03:11,931 --> 02:03:15,260
up here. Yeah. And um, you know,

1822
02:03:15,261 --> 02:03:20,261
to kind of get to how we
ended up joining forces.

1823
02:03:21,890 --> 02:03:26,270
It's funny because you know, you
were just some guy, you know,

1824
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:29,500
some crazy guy up in Maine
in my opinion that I'd,

1825
02:03:29,501 --> 02:03:33,320
well I'd seen a couple of your videos
and I've seen it. I see a dude, you know,

1826
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:37,460
you have the video that shows you pulling
this freaking loom out of this factory.

1827
02:03:37,940 --> 02:03:39,200
And I'm just thinking to myself,

1828
02:03:39,201 --> 02:03:44,060
this guy is insane and I think
I like him and I had actually,

1829
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:47,600
the funny thing is for my gym
in San Diego, victory MMA,

1830
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:51,890
I wanted to make Jujitsu gies in
America and so I was like, okay, this,

1831
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:54,320
I looked around,
I find one guy that's doing it,

1832
02:03:54,350 --> 02:03:57,380
it's you w w like three or four years ago,

1833
02:03:57,381 --> 02:04:00,320
we went back and forth
on email and you know,

1834
02:04:00,321 --> 02:04:02,660
nothing ever came of
it because I was busy.

1835
02:04:02,660 --> 02:04:06,260
You were busy and just nothing happened,
but I always just remember, hey,

1836
02:04:06,261 --> 02:04:09,800
you know what? This guy up in
Maine, he's, he's, he's doing what?

1837
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:11,240
He's doing it the right way.

1838
02:04:11,870 --> 02:04:16,870
And what happened was the weight we
actually got connected was I was on a

1839
02:04:17,631 --> 02:04:22,490
Facebook live just talking
to people and someone says,

1840
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:26,630
what kind of, Gee should I get? And
I just rattled off. I go, hey man,

1841
02:04:26,631 --> 02:04:27,590
if you're going to,
if you need a g,

1842
02:04:27,591 --> 02:04:30,500
you're starting Jujitsu or you're good
at Jujitsu or you just want a good gee,

1843
02:04:30,740 --> 02:04:35,560
I go get a Guinea from origin
origin main.com. I go get
a gift from there. I go,

1844
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,920
this crazy guy up there,
he a Lou,

1845
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:40,920
I can't say it without laughing
because it's so pretty. I'm like,

1846
02:04:40,980 --> 02:04:42,430
he took a loom out of uh,

1847
02:04:42,690 --> 02:04:47,010
out of a broken factory and he refurbish
that thing with his team and they built,

1848
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:49,740
you know, they're doing it, they're
building it. So if you need a key,

1849
02:04:50,120 --> 02:04:52,050
I said I'd try and talk
to this guy cause I had,

1850
02:04:52,051 --> 02:04:54,270
I had reached out to you a couple
of times of, through various,

1851
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:57,330
even since the time I
asked for, for uh, Jeez,

1852
02:04:57,690 --> 02:05:00,840
I'd said sent you an email or
something. And I said, you know,

1853
02:05:00,841 --> 02:05:03,690
I'm trying to talk to him. If anybody
knows this guy, his name is Pete.

1854
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,190
I go tell him I said,
what's up?

1855
02:05:06,720 --> 02:05:10,890
And this awesome woman that
listens to the podcast,

1856
02:05:11,080 --> 02:05:14,400
her name is Sarah Armstrong, and
she's super squared away, you know,

1857
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:19,350
a professional with a, with a
big company. And she, you know,

1858
02:05:19,351 --> 02:05:21,660
she had communicated me with
the various things over the,

1859
02:05:21,690 --> 02:05:26,360
over the past year that I've been
doing the podcast and whatnot, and for,

1860
02:05:26,730 --> 02:05:31,730
she said, Oh, I'll take that for action.
And she contacted, she contacted you,

1861
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:35,820
called me. And what'd she say?

1862
02:05:37,260 --> 02:05:42,180
She just said, uh, you basically,
she's like, have you heard of this guy?

1863
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,880
Jockowillink and dude,
I'm sorry.

1864
02:05:44,881 --> 02:05:47,940
I had my head up my ass for the last five
years trying to build this factory no

1865
02:05:47,941 --> 02:05:52,620
factor. And I was like, you're like, who?
Oh, and then so you know, what do I do?

1866
02:05:52,621 --> 02:05:55,770
I dig. I'm like, Holy Shit. I'm like,

1867
02:05:55,771 --> 02:06:00,750
this guy is making some waves.
This is awesome. And so,

1868
02:06:00,751 --> 02:06:01,584
uh,

1869
02:06:02,460 --> 02:06:07,460
I did a little recon and then
I reached out to after that.

1870
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:13,040
And what's awesome is I had no idea
what we were going to do. Yeah.

1871
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:14,970
Um,
you know,

1872
02:06:14,971 --> 02:06:18,630
we went back and forth couple of times
on email and then finally you're like,

1873
02:06:18,631 --> 02:06:22,650
hey man, let's, let's just go to Skype,
right. Let's do Skype. Because we'd been,

1874
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,150
I today, you know, when you want
to do something, you're like,

1875
02:06:24,151 --> 02:06:26,230
I want to do somebody want to do.
I'm like, well, let's pick, you know,

1876
02:06:26,231 --> 02:06:27,780
figure it out. Send me an
email about this. You're like,

1877
02:06:27,781 --> 02:06:32,160
how about we do a Skype call?
So I have my meetings,

1878
02:06:32,161 --> 02:06:34,530
like scheduled, I'm working all day. Sure.

1879
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:38,310
And I blocked two hours.
I'm like, you know what,

1880
02:06:38,370 --> 02:06:41,250
this is probably going to take awhile
to get this conversation going on about

1881
02:06:41,251 --> 02:06:44,280
two hours or we're just going to get on
Skype and make this happen or figure out

1882
02:06:44,281 --> 02:06:45,114
what we can do.

1883
02:06:45,300 --> 02:06:49,470
So we ended up talking
on Skype for four hours,

1884
02:06:50,010 --> 02:06:53,190
talking, laughing,
talking, laughing, yelling.

1885
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:59,970
After I got off, my wife goes, it
sounded like you were talking to you.

1886
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,870
That's not good.
She was a little scared and uh,

1887
02:07:05,040 --> 02:07:09,960
and it was just, you know, it was,
it was awesome for me. It was,

1888
02:07:09,961 --> 02:07:13,380
you know, the things that I
believe in as, as an American,

1889
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:18,540
as a person, as a new
Englander, it was like a,

1890
02:07:18,541 --> 02:07:23,240
you had the thing that I didn't
have, right? Like w you know,

1891
02:07:23,250 --> 02:07:25,860
for instance, we're, we're, we're
making things, we're building things,

1892
02:07:25,861 --> 02:07:29,480
but we don't have vertical integration.
We don't, we didn't, we weren't,

1893
02:07:29,481 --> 02:07:33,150
we weren't doing it the way
I want to get it done and so,

1894
02:07:34,170 --> 02:07:36,250
you know what I'm saying?
Hey like join forces.

1895
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:39,250
Absolutely.
And from my perspective,

1896
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:44,920
of course I was like this
dude is for real. I was like,

1897
02:07:45,120 --> 02:07:46,840
I would already told my wife.
I was like, man, this guy,

1898
02:07:47,480 --> 02:07:52,360
he's on another level and we,
we had been like looking for somebody,

1899
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:56,310
I remember talking with the Deco
and the psych in too. It's like Ah,

1900
02:07:57,130 --> 02:08:01,060
you've got all these world champs and
then you have like the flavor of the month

1901
02:08:01,061 --> 02:08:05,140
guys with like a fancy
Jujitsu stuff and we just,

1902
02:08:05,170 --> 02:08:10,170
it just was never part of our plan
to sponsor Jujitsu world champions.

1903
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:14,230
Right. Because what we were trying to
build is like much bigger than that.

1904
02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:18,010
It's like, man, we've been talking
for like a year. Like we need to,

1905
02:08:18,370 --> 02:08:23,370
we need to find somebody
or partner somebody with
somebody that like represents

1906
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:28,960
origin through and
through in multiple ways.

1907
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:33,430
This is impossible. You, we
will not find this person.

1908
02:08:34,390 --> 02:08:37,570
It's not possible.
And then

1909
02:08:39,190 --> 02:08:42,060
you're, you're, you were, we were
talking to earlier today, this was,

1910
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:44,120
this was classic because
I didn't remember this.

1911
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:47,870
So for those of you that know
anything about negotiation,

1912
02:08:47,990 --> 02:08:52,190
whether you're negotiating
a car purchase or whatever,

1913
02:08:52,670 --> 02:08:53,570
one of the things,

1914
02:08:53,571 --> 02:08:58,571
one of the tactics of negotiation
is you don't give a number first.

1915
02:08:58,821 --> 02:09:03,470
So if I want, if, if echo wants
to buy these sunglasses, he says,

1916
02:09:03,471 --> 02:09:06,200
how much are these?
I don't say they're 10 bucks.

1917
02:09:06,260 --> 02:09:09,710
Cause what if he was willing to pay 20
right? So, so, you know, if, if he says,

1918
02:09:09,711 --> 02:09:11,900
how much of these I go, well, you know,
what are you willing to pay for him?

1919
02:09:12,110 --> 02:09:14,330
And then he should say, well, you know,
I don't know. What are they worth to you?

1920
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:19,190
And so Pete and I had the textbook.
It was, it was more than that though,

1921
02:09:19,191 --> 02:09:21,320
because it was,
it was the strategies is like,

1922
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:22,550
what are you gonna do while you've got to,

1923
02:09:22,760 --> 02:09:27,630
you've got to devalue or show value
me. So going back and forth, well,

1924
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:32,540
well, yeah, well, yeah, yeah. But you
know, it's like, you know, back and forth,

1925
02:09:32,630 --> 02:09:36,170
battle, battle battle. And
then I caved. They did.

1926
02:09:36,171 --> 02:09:40,410
So we were trying to figure out the
value of whatever, if something and,

1927
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,830
and I'm like, well, Geez, you know what?
Like, you know, just give me, I mean,

1928
02:09:42,831 --> 02:09:45,170
what if you had to, what would you, what
would you say a number of eve of that?

1929
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:49,220
And, and he's, you know, he's gives
me x and I didn't remember doing this,

1930
02:09:49,221 --> 02:09:51,860
but he told me that. And then I
remembered as he says, you know,

1931
02:09:51,861 --> 02:09:56,160
the value's probably x and I
went to your weekend spoken.

1932
02:09:56,180 --> 02:10:01,180
We both started laughing because
we've been playing the game was like,

1933
02:10:01,800 --> 02:10:05,360
actually that is what,
like both,

1934
02:10:05,390 --> 02:10:09,490
I think both of us realized we were just
let, let's just get it, let's do this.

1935
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:13,170
But actually, you know, I'm
busy. You're busy. Yeah.

1936
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:16,910
And so we,
and we actually,

1937
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:20,300
we both definitely got
along. We, we, I mean,

1938
02:10:20,301 --> 02:10:23,300
I think both of us felt really
solid about the other person,

1939
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:26,570
but we didn't quite figure out how to,

1940
02:10:26,571 --> 02:10:29,410
we couldn't figure out how to
make this work. Yeah. You know,

1941
02:10:29,480 --> 02:10:34,280
he's got something that he's put
years of blood, sweat and tears into.

1942
02:10:34,640 --> 02:10:35,840
I've got something that I've been doing.

1943
02:10:35,990 --> 02:10:40,930
My life has been to get to here and so
we just couldn't quite figure out, wow,

1944
02:10:40,940 --> 02:10:42,710
this was going to work.
So we just, you know,

1945
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:47,711
we kept in touch a little
bit of conversation over
the next couple months and

1946
02:10:48,201 --> 02:10:50,940
then I knew I was going
to Maine. You, you,

1947
02:10:51,250 --> 02:10:54,570
you can I gotta ask you
something now? Yeah. Do you,

1948
02:10:54,670 --> 02:10:58,880
you knew you were coming to Maine. I knew
you were coming to Maine. Neither of us.

1949
02:10:58,881 --> 02:11:02,120
Like we didn't text back and forth until
the last minute because I knew the date

1950
02:11:02,121 --> 02:11:06,940
you were coming to Maine. Uh Huh. Did you,

1951
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:12,300
were you planning on a meeting when
you came to Maine the whole time are

1952
02:11:12,301 --> 02:11:14,260
definitely knew we needed to meet.
Yeah.

1953
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:16,663
Yeah.

1954
02:11:17,230 --> 02:11:20,480
He's like, you were icing me, be on ice.

1955
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:23,680
I thought I was putting you on ice.

1956
02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:29,650
We were both on ice. Yeah.
So that was an oil is it?

1957
02:11:29,651 --> 02:11:34,170
That was like the meeting. Who Will,
awesome. When we met up in Portland, uh,

1958
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:37,690
we had dinner. We actually both
brought our wives and I and I,

1959
02:11:37,720 --> 02:11:41,460
my wife is always too busy to do
anything business wise with money.

1960
02:11:41,480 --> 02:11:44,560
So she was super stoked to even be
around and meet a man and everything.

1961
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,450
And you know,
you,

1962
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:49,990
we sat there are wives don't even know
what they were doing because you and I

1963
02:11:49,991 --> 02:11:52,930
were just in the zone and,

1964
02:11:52,990 --> 02:11:57,610
and at the end of the night we figured
out and we shook hands on it and I knew

1965
02:11:57,611 --> 02:12:01,000
right there we were good. We, we, we
crafted the deal. That was awesome. Yeah,

1966
02:12:01,240 --> 02:12:03,340
it was awesome for both of us.

1967
02:12:03,370 --> 02:12:07,830
It was awesome for everything that
both of us want to achieve. And it did.

1968
02:12:07,890 --> 02:12:11,980
He turned into not even both of us started
to us. Exactly. And that was awesome.

1969
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:17,020
And I think one of the best,
like lessons learned from,

1970
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:22,360
from me,
what is just an incredible opportunity.

1971
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:27,510
That's how I see opportunity in crafting
a deal is making sure that you're both

1972
02:12:29,261 --> 02:12:34,261
getting what you want in your both a
little bit uncomfortable so that you

1973
02:12:34,631 --> 02:12:36,070
continue to

1974
02:12:38,600 --> 02:12:43,600
feel a little bit of the struggle to
make sure you can take it over the goal

1975
02:12:44,121 --> 02:12:47,780
line. Right. You're too comfortable,
you'll become complacent,

1976
02:12:48,290 --> 02:12:52,790
bite off a little more than you can chew
and you're going to be chewing for much

1977
02:12:52,791 --> 02:12:57,440
longer. So that's, that's something
that was important. It was awesome.

1978
02:12:57,620 --> 02:12:59,870
Yeah. Ed. So just so everyone knows,

1979
02:12:59,900 --> 02:13:04,190
I mean know I've been saying it like
we're partners, you know, we're,

1980
02:13:04,191 --> 02:13:07,430
we're partners with,
with the podcast in what,

1981
02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:11,120
what echo and I had been doing for the
last couple of years and what origin been

1982
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:15,710
has been doing for the last five
years? Seven years. Four, five,

1983
02:13:15,711 --> 02:13:18,320
five years. Six years. Yeah. Six years.

1984
02:13:18,830 --> 02:13:22,730
And at the end of the night when we
got done eating our steaks in Portland,

1985
02:13:22,731 --> 02:13:26,360
Maine, uh, we shook hands
and, and this whole,

1986
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,750
you know, you've described
it as like a perfect storm,

1987
02:13:29,780 --> 02:13:33,660
which is what it feels like
to me. Hey Man, I was born
in Gloucester. There you go.

1988
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:38,540
It is the perfect score. Go. You got,
we are the perfect storm. Yeah. Um, and,

1989
02:13:38,600 --> 02:13:40,910
and so that's what's going
on is that you don't,

1990
02:13:40,911 --> 02:13:45,911
now we've got this and
we joined forces and,

1991
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:50,320
uh, that we, we both compliment
each others, you know, in,

1992
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:51,390
in terms of our business,

1993
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:54,450
we compliment each other's weaknesses
in terms of our personalities.

1994
02:13:54,840 --> 02:13:58,770
We compliment each other's
weaknesses and WWE were,

1995
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:02,640
and the best part about it is the
whole time that we're doing it,

1996
02:14:02,670 --> 02:14:06,150
we're actually laughing our asses off
at each other and having a great time,

1997
02:14:06,151 --> 02:14:10,290
which is, which is what it's all
about. So that's where we're at.

1998
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:15,270
That's why we're here, by the way. That's
why we're here. By the way, in Farmington,

1999
02:14:15,271 --> 02:14:19,170
Maine, in the origin
factory, 20,000 square feet,

2000
02:14:20,280 --> 02:14:23,010
we're going to end up with how
many employees in here in a year?

2001
02:14:23,011 --> 02:14:25,530
How many employees were going to
have in here? Oh, probably in a year.

2002
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:30,210
I don't know. 30, 40, 50.
I mean, somewhere in there,
you know, between 30 and 50.

2003
02:14:30,870 --> 02:14:34,650
That's in a year by,
remember this is a start.

2004
02:14:35,700 --> 02:14:36,533
We're starting.

2005
02:14:38,200 --> 02:14:41,710
And so in five years we're going
to have a lot of people. Oh yeah,

2006
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:46,660
we're and people ask, what are you
going to make? Everything. And I say,

2007
02:14:46,690 --> 02:14:51,100
we're gonna make everything.
Everything that I use in my life,

2008
02:14:51,610 --> 02:14:54,010
I want it made here in America,

2009
02:14:54,580 --> 02:14:58,600
from the shorts to the hats,
everything.

2010
02:14:59,470 --> 02:15:02,620
And that's what we're going to do.
Beanies,

2011
02:15:04,690 --> 02:15:09,350
uh, probably pants, pants. You know
what? I was at a store the other day,

2012
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:11,450
uh, you know, like a hardware store,

2013
02:15:11,480 --> 02:15:16,220
but with a big one where they sell
work clothes. And I said to myself,

2014
02:15:16,490 --> 02:15:19,190
you know, let's just, cause obviously
I'm thinking about this all the time now,

2015
02:15:19,700 --> 02:15:22,850
you know, it's hard, hard to look at
work clothes and you say, of course,

2016
02:15:23,180 --> 02:15:26,390
American workers, they would want
to wear American made clothes.

2017
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:29,180
Were these clothes made?
They're not made here.

2018
02:15:29,330 --> 02:15:32,240
And then I made American and they're
not made by American hands. Um,

2019
02:15:32,450 --> 02:15:37,370
so I think we're going to be in a take
no prisoners scenario and we're going to

2020
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:40,940
Jay after it went on.
I just kind of take no prisoners.

2021
02:15:41,270 --> 02:15:43,790
We're going to chase the big dogs.

2022
02:15:45,850 --> 02:15:50,570
He'd look out, listen and
look out. And that's not,

2023
02:15:50,810 --> 02:15:55,640
that's not like an ego thing. That's
the truth. Yeah. Listen and look out.

2024
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:59,300
Yeah. And like I said
today, when, when you,

2025
02:15:59,960 --> 02:16:04,310
when you rekindle the fire
now of manufacturing and the,

2026
02:16:04,350 --> 02:16:08,870
you rekindle, I mean, just talking
to talking to the employees here,

2027
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:14,750
this is what they want to do.
100% and this is what they
made to do. That's right.

2028
02:16:14,751 --> 02:16:15,411
And like you said,

2029
02:16:15,411 --> 02:16:18,380
they want to take these things and
build them with their hands who got it.

2030
02:16:18,410 --> 02:16:23,150
And that Opportunity's been taken away
in the last 25 years and we're bringing

2031
02:16:23,151 --> 02:16:27,740
it back and that is awesome. Appreciate
that. Glad to have you as part of it.

2032
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,003
Awesome.

2033
02:16:32,020 --> 02:16:35,050
That's what we did. Echo
Charles Right now, my brother,

2034
02:16:37,180 --> 02:16:40,330
speaking of what we do.
Sure.

2035
02:16:40,750 --> 02:16:45,310
Why don't you do what you do.
I have a question or you ask a question.

2036
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:48,520
Do you find it

2037
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:55,440
poetic that the origin
logo is that circle?

2038
02:16:56,050 --> 02:17:00,640
Remember when you were getting shit
from the politician? It's funny. No,

2039
02:17:00,710 --> 02:17:03,640
never thought about that. Now you
have an origin logo. That's a circle.

2040
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:05,240
Okay.

2041
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:09,650
It is a bill. That kinda in and of
itself is like a circle. It's actually,

2042
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:13,190
it is a wave. It's a, it's
actually like a rip curl wave.

2043
02:17:13,191 --> 02:17:16,040
Is that what that logo is?
The is the flow.

2044
02:17:17,790 --> 02:17:22,380
Did you Jitsu flow? The surf flow? The
store. It's a wave is what that is.

2045
02:17:22,381 --> 02:17:26,130
And that's what breaking symbolic is.
What they'd call it. I'll just say ironic,

2046
02:17:26,131 --> 02:17:29,700
but that's not ironic cause symbolic.
Symbolic. Symbolic. So yeah.

2047
02:17:30,030 --> 02:17:33,840
Oh no one even remembers that. I don't
even remember who that politician was.

2048
02:17:34,100 --> 02:17:37,850
It doesn't even matter. Nope. They're
going to know what that origins dry

2049
02:17:39,780 --> 02:17:44,640
in the industry or we call that
layers. True Story. Anyway,

2050
02:17:44,700 --> 02:17:47,370
speaking of layers. Got
It. And support by the way,

2054
02:17:57,300 --> 02:18:00,080
Yeah. So good to know.
What do we got geese.

2055
02:18:00,081 --> 02:18:04,770
So that's the thing from the beginning.
People ask what's the key to get?

2056
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:10,500
We know, we don't know. It's hard to
100% now. Hundred percent. You know,

2057
02:18:10,501 --> 02:18:13,530
he had like a hierarchy. You
know, he only has one genome,

2058
02:18:13,860 --> 02:18:18,450
but you have multiple selections though.
Yeah. So they do absolutely. Boom. Edward,

2059
02:18:18,480 --> 02:18:22,590
we're about to like blow
up our manufacturing.

2060
02:18:23,010 --> 02:18:25,740
Um, and this new factory
again, grand opening today.

2061
02:18:26,850 --> 02:18:29,640
Lots of product coming right
on the east side of stuff.

2062
02:18:29,830 --> 02:18:34,500
Ramping things up over the next,
what time frame we've started ramping,

2063
02:18:34,850 --> 02:18:37,860
uh, over the next four to
six, four to eight weeks.

2064
02:18:37,861 --> 02:18:42,030
Let's say we're going to be
hiring another 16 people.

2065
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:44,580
We put another loom in the factory.

2066
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:49,230
So there's just three looms now and
we're going to be weaving Ninjas.

2067
02:18:49,440 --> 02:18:52,790
Like, like super real. It's like I,

2068
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:57,240
I mean I didn't want to elaborate. You
just come, come to Maine and see, yeah.

2069
02:18:57,270 --> 02:19:00,690
Anytime in the factory. Come
check it out. I like it.

2070
02:19:01,560 --> 02:19:04,350
When are the shorts coming
out that I'm wearing? Oh boy.

2071
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:06,260
Cause they're straight up.
My best short now

2072
02:19:09,480 --> 02:19:10,470
we're going to make it happen.

2073
02:19:15,500 --> 02:19:19,360
Well Hey, I get that all the
time. Hey, when is the, you
know, Xyz coming out. Hey,

2074
02:19:19,380 --> 02:19:21,810
so now it's on you a little
bit, you know. But yeah,

2075
02:19:21,811 --> 02:19:23,200
these are straight up
the best shorts though.

2076
02:19:23,210 --> 02:19:25,800
It's not actually that hard for you
because people say when's that next? Oh,

2077
02:19:25,801 --> 02:19:29,430
you're talking about the,
the the gear side. Yeah,

2078
02:19:30,020 --> 02:19:31,340
the merchandising side.

2079
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:35,000
And I do believe that it might be a little
bit more work on pizza and compare it

2080
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:38,740
to on my end a little bit. But
Hey, I don't know from a, from a,

2081
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:42,470
if you go from like the level
that you're currently cruising at,

2082
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:48,250
maybe you both have to travel the same
distance it relative to the work done,

2083
02:19:49,101 --> 02:19:53,850
relatively speaking. I think you're right.
And yeah, but not just geese, right? No,

2084
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:57,150
no. We bunch of, you know,
apparel, everything is, you know,

2085
02:19:57,240 --> 02:20:00,230
like our t shirts or knit.
Like we have a partner that knits,

2086
02:20:00,380 --> 02:20:04,840
knits all the fabric like six hours
away or something. Everything's,

2087
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:07,040
everything's sourced and made here.

2088
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:10,510
We make all our own compression
apparel like cotton.

2089
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:15,350
So sublimate dye sublimation, everything
you say. Compression apparel. Yeah.

2090
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:18,170
I still call it a rash guard. It's
a rash guard. I know. I'm just,

2091
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:23,040
because I know it's not just a rash guard.
This rash guard is for surfing. Right.

2092
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:25,310
But, but, but like the, like, like the,

2093
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:29,630
we still call it in the Jujitsu
community, don't we still say? Yeah,

2094
02:20:29,631 --> 02:20:32,810
I got a new rash guard. Oh yeah. Well he's
still saying that. I'm just making sure,

2095
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:35,420
cause I wasn't like hearing
someone at the gym saying like,

2096
02:20:35,450 --> 02:20:40,340
did you check out this new compression
on the weight room? They do say that.

2097
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:43,400
Right. I see. Like in
football. Football, yeah.

2098
02:20:43,401 --> 02:20:48,230
Like you'll see some company that's
advertising compression gear. Yeah, yeah,

2099
02:20:48,231 --> 02:20:53,000
yeah, yeah, exactly. And I'm like, Oh,
you mean a rash guard trying be on me.

2100
02:20:53,001 --> 02:20:56,150
You got to remember like every textile
is different than what you're used to.

2101
02:20:56,151 --> 02:20:56,900
Like,

2102
02:20:56,900 --> 02:21:01,900
like the warp wit we use are our textile
for the rash card or tights or whatever

2103
02:21:02,271 --> 02:21:06,380
else is different.
And you just called him tights?

2104
02:21:06,590 --> 02:21:07,910
I did because spats,

2105
02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:11,690
I have no idea what a SPAC is
going to say out in California.

2106
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:14,320
It's definitely called spats,
spats.

2107
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,700
And I don't even know where
that word comes from. Spat.

2108
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:19,130
I knew spats is when you tape your ankles,

2109
02:21:21,240 --> 02:21:24,530
you spank your leg.
I bet you,

2110
02:21:24,710 --> 02:21:26,510
I bet you wait,

2111
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:29,940
did this spats go down your leg
like tights and it around your foot?

2112
02:21:30,060 --> 02:21:31,890
Just tape over it.
He just take,

2113
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:34,820
but instead of your ankles
under your socks or whatever,

2114
02:21:34,821 --> 02:21:37,430
if you take over everything
over your shoe, over everything,

2115
02:21:38,420 --> 02:21:42,040
trainer stopped doing cause it's, so
why don't we call him compression pedal?

2116
02:21:42,310 --> 02:21:43,960
Cause I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be, you know,

2117
02:21:44,390 --> 02:21:49,070
earlier we got kind of like wrapped around
or we got sidetracked about me being

2118
02:21:49,220 --> 02:21:53,690
sensitive about something or
not being sensitive tights.

2119
02:21:54,140 --> 02:21:58,250
You're not down for 10 a dude. Right?
We're not wearing tights, not happening.

2120
02:21:58,580 --> 02:22:01,590
Pants come. Compression pants. That
sounds good. Compression shirt.

2121
02:22:01,591 --> 02:22:05,600
See their ego compression
shirt, compression and rash
pants, rash guard pants.

2122
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:08,250
That doesn't make sense either. Does
it, even though they do prevent rashes

2123
02:22:09,830 --> 02:22:13,230
or did you get to met burn these?
You know why people,

2124
02:22:13,250 --> 02:22:17,150
you know why a lot of people
wear compression pants
and compression shirts in

2125
02:22:17,151 --> 02:22:21,830
Jujitsu, the prevention
of the disease, the funk,

2126
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:24,470
right? They don't want
the hing horn, right?

2127
02:22:24,500 --> 02:22:25,860
They don't want that to hit one reward.

2128
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:28,200
They don't want, you know, whatever.

2129
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:33,260
Various Bursa and so people wear that
and the people that I know that where it,

2130
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:38,880
they seem to believe in it. Oh yeah.
Just the level of, it's not like, uh,

2131
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:40,230
like the,

2132
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:45,230
what's the sun protection bringing
pf last 50 or UPF UPF yet UPF 50.

2133
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:51,070
There's no anti ring warm
percentage rating. Right, right.

2134
02:22:51,130 --> 02:22:54,030
There's the general end time.
My crew will Beall. Right.

2135
02:22:54,570 --> 02:22:59,400
Like certification and that keeps
it from growing in the material.

2136
02:22:59,490 --> 02:23:04,490
What I'm saying is if you were like a
compression shirt and compression pants,

2137
02:23:05,450 --> 02:23:05,910
sure.

2138
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:09,980
Then you're not rubbing your skin against
some savage that came into the gym or

2139
02:23:09,981 --> 02:23:14,580
have ringworm, so you have less percentage
with him too. But yeah, we're rolling.

2140
02:23:14,581 --> 02:23:17,880
Put a triangle on his ringworm on
his or something like this. Yeah,

2141
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:19,570
you don't need that,
so you don't want it.

2142
02:23:19,580 --> 02:23:24,580
That's a good reason to wear compression
gear ration card across the board and

2143
02:23:24,981 --> 02:23:29,550
the rash guards are there now.
They're not like the rash guard.

2144
02:23:29,551 --> 02:23:33,230
You're used to the ones you put on and
then they on talk and then you talk about

2145
02:23:33,240 --> 02:23:34,290
it in the on talking and talking man.

2146
02:23:34,650 --> 02:23:39,030
They're designed to stay tucked in so
you put them on and the way the fibers

2147
02:23:39,060 --> 02:23:40,860
flex and bend with your body.

2148
02:23:41,490 --> 02:23:45,360
It's not your mothers or
grandmothers rash garden.

2149
02:23:45,960 --> 02:23:50,010
So when, when you say tucked in because
you don't really tuck in a rash guard,

2150
02:23:50,190 --> 02:23:53,800
right? Or do you? You're talking
about under the Ghia. Okay.

2151
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:57,270
Oh yeah. That's, that's a whole
new world right there. Yeah.

2152
02:23:57,540 --> 02:24:00,900
Some places make you wear rash
guard under your G. Oh, okay. Yeah.

2153
02:24:01,690 --> 02:24:03,070
I think it's good to have
a rash guard in here.

2154
02:24:03,330 --> 02:24:07,400
I know a lot of people think that it's
not traditional. I mean I misread dish.

2155
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:11,400
Yeah. In that one. I liked the barrier.

2156
02:24:11,670 --> 02:24:16,380
I liked the, I liked the key or
the, I liked the barrier, um,

2157
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:18,900
between the, the, the fabric and the skin.

2158
02:24:18,930 --> 02:24:21,720
I like to compression because
you compress your muscle,

2159
02:24:21,721 --> 02:24:26,580
you get more use your straight
performance performance.

2160
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:27,810
Yup. Got It. Absolutely.

2161
02:24:27,960 --> 02:24:31,140
The key slides a little bit better on a
rash guard than it does your skin once

2162
02:24:31,141 --> 02:24:35,690
it's all sweated up and sticky.
So that's why he use it. And um,

2163
02:24:35,770 --> 02:24:39,900
I Harry Creek too. Nobody wants
a chest hair space. That's right.

2164
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:44,280
They don't want that. You know, would
be happy if we all wore rash guards.

2165
02:24:44,281 --> 02:24:47,490
She's our black belt at our gym,

2166
02:24:47,491 --> 02:24:52,491
female and she is still a girl.

2167
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:58,020
So things like chest hairs. Yeah.
She's not happy about those. Those,

2168
02:24:58,230 --> 02:25:02,940
she begs me to where you don't something
under my gate. She's so far failed.

2169
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:08,220
Failed on my grown man. But um, you know,

2170
02:25:08,221 --> 02:25:10,170
the other thing is you,

2171
02:25:10,200 --> 02:25:14,610
we didn't talk about origin
main.com is supplements. Absolutely.

2172
02:25:14,611 --> 02:25:18,900
So on the body and in your body.
There you go. That's it. There you go.

2173
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:22,800
We're going to put everything you need
on your body and everything you need in

2174
02:25:22,801 --> 02:25:25,420
your body. Krill oil.
Yes. Really that's the,

2175
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:27,960
that's the one now it's Krill
oil and then a super critical,

2176
02:25:28,480 --> 02:25:32,230
one of the things that you know,
you'll be happy to know that Pete and I,

2177
02:25:32,290 --> 02:25:37,290
we like to make things happen and you
know obviously I'm a big fan of Krill oil

2178
02:25:38,530 --> 02:25:41,980
for instance.
So you know what I was,

2179
02:25:41,981 --> 02:25:43,600
I used to be a fan of white tea.

2180
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:47,890
[inaudible] a big fan and I drank it a
lot and eventually I said you know what,

2181
02:25:47,891 --> 02:25:49,690
I need this Jocko white tea.

2182
02:25:51,700 --> 02:25:56,500
And so I had a similar thing happened
with Carrillo. I want to have krill oil.

2183
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:00,730
Good Carrillo so you know what
we're making good krill oil. Yeah,

2184
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:04,060
actually we like to call it Jocko super.

2185
02:26:05,070 --> 02:26:09,880
So Jocko super grill, we're,
we're making that awesome quality.

2186
02:26:11,980 --> 02:26:15,430
On top of that we got a little,
again,

2187
02:26:16,660 --> 02:26:18,930
littleG , we need joint
maintenance, right?

2188
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:22,210
We need joint man is when we are active.
When we're training Jiu Jitsu,

2189
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:24,010
when were Jack and big steel?

2190
02:26:24,950 --> 02:26:28,120
We are tendons and everything
and get a little bit sore. Sore.

2191
02:26:28,480 --> 02:26:30,610
We might not admit to it in public,

2192
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:35,170
just like we wouldn't admit to
crying on a public situation.

2193
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:39,100
Ever uncomfortable with my masculine
has to be because I'm over here. Whoa.

2194
02:26:39,370 --> 02:26:43,200
Now don't cry and cry.
My wife says Pete,

2195
02:26:43,570 --> 02:26:46,630
the only time you cry is babies and belts.

2196
02:26:47,120 --> 02:26:51,840
When someone gets promoted and someone
has a kid. What about weddings? No, no,

2197
02:26:51,970 --> 02:26:54,490
no funerals and weddings.
No. So we got another,

2198
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:57,130
another thing we're coming out with.

2199
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:02,880
It's a Jocko joint warfare for your
joints go to war against the pain.

2200
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:11,900
Inflammation in each generation.
Yeah.

2201
02:27:12,460 --> 02:27:15,640
And I've been kicking it for since we,

2202
02:27:15,670 --> 02:27:19,390
since we originally formulated.
Yep. And I got the samples.

2203
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:24,480
I went on it hardcore and
it's Flagella legit the board

2204
02:27:26,440 --> 02:27:27,273
about that.

2205
02:27:28,510 --> 02:27:32,530
I have like bad back
from sports and stuff.

2206
02:27:32,950 --> 02:27:36,430
Herniated disc,
bulging disc didn't get surgery.

2207
02:27:36,820 --> 02:27:38,380
Severe Arthritis.

2208
02:27:39,340 --> 02:27:42,850
I can train seven days a week if
I want it to. As a matter of fact,

2209
02:27:42,851 --> 02:27:46,910
we have our mission immersion campus
week train every day, every day.

2210
02:27:47,620 --> 02:27:51,430
That's it. Joint Warfare,
it keeping it real.

2211
02:27:51,690 --> 02:27:54,970
So that stuff we,
it's being manufactured.

2212
02:27:54,971 --> 02:27:58,850
We had been on the samples for
one a month and a half. Um,

2213
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:04,110
and now it's been being manufactured
in America check and very close by.

2214
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:11,380
Right. By a partner. Right. And, and
so it's gonna be on the website now,

2215
02:28:12,190 --> 02:28:16,150
preorder it. And that way we can
get to get a feel for how much,

2216
02:28:16,180 --> 02:28:17,290
cause we've got a bunch coming.

2217
02:28:17,740 --> 02:28:20,860
We need to figure out how much of
a bunch is that actually means.

2218
02:28:21,590 --> 02:28:24,980
So kind of like with Jocko white tea,
I didn't do that. I just said, oh,

2219
02:28:24,981 --> 02:28:26,720
the Jocko white tea for sale.
It was gone.

2220
02:28:27,470 --> 02:28:31,010
Then I ordered some more and then that
was going on and people were really

2221
02:28:31,011 --> 02:28:32,300
getting angry because when you,
you know,

2222
02:28:32,301 --> 02:28:36,350
when you have Jocko white tea and then
you don't have it, all of a sudden,

2223
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:39,470
you know, things start going
sideways. Yeah, absolutely.

2224
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:42,080
So you got to get that back straight up.
So anyways,

2225
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:43,490
you can check those things out.

2226
02:28:43,850 --> 02:28:48,760
Origin main.com there'll be there joint
warfare. You like that, don't you? I do.

2227
02:28:48,810 --> 02:28:53,570
Yeah. There's a, there's a layer on
there. Yeah. That's deep, deep layers.

2228
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:58,430
Oh yeah. The one person that's going
to get this layer is dean lister.

2229
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:03,740
Yup. Yup, Yup. Trebuchet.
I'll leave it at that. Well,

moving parts and a trebuchet. Yeah.

2231

I gotta keep him grease that.
Got to keep that joints. Sure.

2232
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:16,040
Also speaking to jacking steel
kettle bells.

2233
02:29:16,370 --> 02:29:17,930
So when we came here,
we're in Maine right now.

2234
02:29:18,220 --> 02:29:22,490
If people haven't gathered
that already up in camp. No.

2235
02:29:22,700 --> 02:29:26,990
Like big weight room. Kinda. There's
a little fitness center there. Yeah.

2236
02:29:26,991 --> 02:29:29,120
First night we get here,
one of the guys, they came,

2237
02:29:29,570 --> 02:29:33,260
I brought my Onnit kettle bell
or who wasn't gonna need to

2238
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:38,960
John. John. Yeah, it was John. Yeah.
Nice honey. Kettle Bell. The gorilla.

2239
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:43,870
The ones I just ordered logit their ship.
They're on the way tracking. Anyway. Um,

2240
02:29:44,060 --> 02:29:48,920
yeah, that's the good ones. You do kettle
bells. I don't stop lifting though.

2241
02:29:48,921 --> 02:29:51,620
That's where I stopped. I did.
I stopped lifting two massive,

2242
02:29:52,530 --> 02:29:53,590
well kettlebell massive,

2243
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:58,600
I don't even bring this up because we
talked about this prerecording a so you a

2244
02:29:58,950 --> 02:30:00,440
two 53 right now as we talked about,

2245
02:30:00,441 --> 02:30:04,130
you use the way to 85 and I asked this
question and this is a good question that

2246
02:30:04,131 --> 02:30:05,600
everybody should kind
of hear the answer to.

2247
02:30:06,350 --> 02:30:11,350
Could the 250,250 pound Pete beat the
285 pound Pete in a grappling match and

2248
02:30:15,561 --> 02:30:20,330
your answer was 100% the smaller guy wins.
Why is that?

2249
02:30:21,430 --> 02:30:24,230
I mean lots of reasons.
You're more flexible,

2250
02:30:24,350 --> 02:30:26,570
more flexible and better positioning.

2251
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:29,150
Better escapes cause
there's less mass burning,

2252
02:30:29,151 --> 02:30:33,620
less oxygen because you have
less muscle mass. And for me,

2253
02:30:35,180 --> 02:30:40,180
I would wear the 285
version of myself out.

2254
02:30:41,310 --> 02:30:45,560
So it's I,
I stopped and I love lifting weights.

2255
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:48,500
I love lifting weights,
but for me,

2256
02:30:48,501 --> 02:30:52,580
Jujitsu fulfills the void because it is
resistance. Yeah, you're always working.

2257
02:30:52,581 --> 02:30:56,120
I never feel out of shape.
Well unless I have too many whoopie pies,

2258
02:30:56,400 --> 02:31:01,100
but she do anything to work out
besides Jiu Jitsu. Do you run?

2259
02:31:01,101 --> 02:31:06,020
Do you sprint? No Day. Just
cause you choose who I do.

2260
02:31:06,740 --> 02:31:09,770
Dean lister tells me that when Dean
lister doesn't want to work out,

2261
02:31:09,771 --> 02:31:14,000
doesn't want to do any, you know,
sprints. He's like, no, I get,

2262
02:31:14,090 --> 02:31:16,460
I get it from Jujitsu Jocko.
That's what my best thing.

2263
02:31:16,760 --> 02:31:18,820
So now you're supporting his argument.
Now going to now,

2264
02:31:18,850 --> 02:31:20,190
now got to deal with that.

2265
02:31:20,980 --> 02:31:22,140
We'll be Robert sued.

2266
02:31:22,141 --> 02:31:27,141
You know we will talk about some day
how Jujitsu makes you unathletic.

2267
02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:30,150
Oh really? That's a whole
nother talk. Interesting.

2268
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:34,950
And I have facts on why
it makes you on athletic,

2269
02:31:35,220 --> 02:31:38,790
what it keeps you. It keeps your
body together, your core together,

2270
02:31:38,791 --> 02:31:41,910
your muscles strong.
So what does it do to make you unathletic?

2271
02:31:42,300 --> 02:31:44,190
It's slow movement.
You slow,

2272
02:31:44,191 --> 02:31:47,670
you start when you started you to your
body slows down, your mind slows down,

2273
02:31:47,671 --> 02:31:48,630
your muscle slowed down.

2274
02:31:48,780 --> 02:31:52,230
Whenever you had for fast twitch turns
a slow twitch because you're pulling and

2275
02:31:52,231 --> 02:31:54,120
tugging and you're moving slow.

2276
02:31:54,510 --> 02:31:57,600
I used to be able to dunk a basketball
every dunk so you can't touch the rim.

2277
02:31:57,601 --> 02:31:59,400
Now I think we need to,

2278
02:32:00,980 --> 02:32:05,980
I will go ahead and defend the Jujitsu
over here on my side of the table because

2279
02:32:07,640 --> 02:32:12,640
if you continue to do cleans
and you continue to squat,

2280
02:32:13,090 --> 02:32:17,890
yeah. And you can do, you do
sprints and mobility drills and uh,

2281
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:22,250
agility drills. You can keep that
athleticism. I think you're right.

2282
02:32:22,430 --> 02:32:25,880
I know you're right jack.
That's what I did when I competed.

2283
02:32:25,970 --> 02:32:30,170
I had a strength and conditioning
coach, sprint lift, push, pull.

2284
02:32:30,200 --> 02:32:34,160
So I guess big picture is one of those
deals where it kind of confirms the idea

2285
02:32:34,161 --> 02:32:38,390
that you don't have to be
athletic to do good in Jujitsu,

2286
02:32:38,690 --> 02:32:43,370
generally speaking. But if you want to
do some kind of athletic competition,

2287
02:32:43,790 --> 02:32:48,590
including, but not limited to Jiu Jitsu,
it helps to be athletic. Jackson's deal.

2288
02:32:48,630 --> 02:32:52,880
Yeah. I'm kind of glad that you kind of
hit them with that because when I said I

2289
02:32:52,881 --> 02:32:57,150
stopped doing like legs and stuff like
that, I got a lot of crap for it by hand.

2290
02:32:57,690 --> 02:33:02,330
I, I, I did a lot of squats
and college football,

2291
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:06,010
college football. Hell
yeah. I, I'm scared of them.

2292
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:09,310
I like hack squats, hack
squats. Man for sure.

2293
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:13,600
He got bad knees or something bad
back. Bad back. You did my back. Yeah.

2294
02:33:13,760 --> 02:33:18,220
But last time I squatted and I
hit the floor. Right. Of course.

2295
02:33:18,310 --> 02:33:19,130
Bad back,

2296
02:33:19,130 --> 02:33:24,130
bad back from years of major
s and personal question,

2297
02:33:25,210 --> 02:33:30,210
does your ego not allow you to get in
there and do 185 pounds for some higher

2298
02:33:31,751 --> 02:33:36,460
reps? Nope. I do that 100% but you
still don't like it? I do hack squats.

2299
02:33:36,520 --> 02:33:39,610
I still don't write on, I still
don't like it, but I mean it's

2300
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:46,350
steel is great. Yeah. That's the
bottom line. It is great. Yeah.

2301
02:33:48,390 --> 02:33:50,970
I just get it. Jujitsu, man.
I pushed. I do. You know,

2302
02:33:50,971 --> 02:33:54,000
every time I step on the mats at six 10
minute rounds and I've trained to the

2303
02:33:54,001 --> 02:33:58,870
break, so I'm doing 12 minute
rounds. I make sure to get six. Yeah.

2304
02:33:58,950 --> 02:34:00,220
And I,
and I get it as,

2305
02:34:00,310 --> 02:34:05,290
as things free up and my son wants
to lift as he started the summer,

2306
02:34:05,530 --> 02:34:09,200
I'll get in with him and we'll,
we'll press some iron. Yeah.

2307
02:34:10,370 --> 02:34:15,040
Yeah. That sounded pretty, pretty
fired up. You want to go there,

2308
02:34:16,250 --> 02:34:20,020
press a buyer in a big kettle bells
don't get you that be, I mean,

2309
02:34:20,021 --> 02:34:25,020
I'm sure under certain circumstances
they will, but athletic. Yeah,

2310
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:29,790
like a hang clean. Clean them
right here. I'm sorry. The jumpers.

2311
02:34:30,190 --> 02:34:33,940
And the other big thing is when
you like for a kettlebell snatch,

2312
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:38,170
it's a swinging motion and when it gets
to the top you have to stop it, right?

2313
02:34:38,180 --> 02:34:39,490
Because otherwise you're going
to rip your shoulder out.

2314
02:34:39,491 --> 02:34:42,730
So you have to use all this, whatever
that kind of muscle, what is it,

2315
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:45,760
echo centric or something.
What it concentric.

2316
02:34:45,930 --> 02:34:49,660
Whenever you've got to do to stop it
at the top, you got to stop it sorts.

2317
02:34:49,661 --> 02:34:54,170
It's using all these muscles to make that
thing happen. That's cool. Yeah, I mean,

2318
02:34:54,380 --> 02:34:59,020
yeah, yeah, yeah. It's
cool. It'll get fun.

2319
02:34:59,220 --> 02:35:02,880
Like when you start getting like the
balance and then the is the momentum,

2320
02:35:02,881 --> 02:35:04,780
you got to create momentum. Then
you've got a balance. A moment.

2321
02:35:04,781 --> 02:35:08,350
It's like all this stuff is fun.
College. They said that the true,

2322
02:35:08,590 --> 02:35:13,090
a true test of how strong somebody is.
I hang clean.

2323
02:35:13,780 --> 02:35:16,960
Yeah. And they said you could bench a
lot, you could squat on. Yeah, there's,

2324
02:35:16,961 --> 02:35:17,794
there's a lot of people,

2325
02:35:18,170 --> 02:35:20,860
there's a lot of things that you could
say that like for instance, you know,

2326
02:35:20,861 --> 02:35:24,650
what's a good one? Overhead squat spot.

2327
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:30,340
If you've got a guy that can do massive
way big weight and or, or medium weight,

2328
02:35:30,341 --> 02:35:32,290
high reps over and squat this word yet,

2329
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:36,060
but on a hang clean you got to
use your speed also. It's speed,

2330
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:40,480
it's explosive. So you could
just go straight to the
snatch, right? Yeah. Right.

2331
02:35:40,780 --> 02:35:43,510
But then again, the snatch, you
need the balance at the top.

2332
02:35:43,510 --> 02:35:46,370
That's coordination and then
all these other things. So,

2333
02:35:46,570 --> 02:35:49,960
and it depends on what you mean by
strong too. So you know how like I guess,

2334
02:35:49,961 --> 02:35:50,321
you know,
in,

2335
02:35:50,321 --> 02:35:53,980
in certain circles they call strength
power and strength and power are two

2336
02:35:53,981 --> 02:35:56,380
different things. And it's like,
okay, so what are you talking about?

2337
02:35:56,470 --> 02:36:00,890
So I dig it and I agree actually.
But this is also 20 years ago. Yeah,

2338
02:36:00,980 --> 02:36:04,720
exactly right. You get another point to
consider. That's a really good change.

2339
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:09,790
You think they agree? You said hang clean,
right? Hang clean. That's a real metric.

2340
02:36:09,990 --> 02:36:14,770
Yeah. The solid metric. Yeah,
for sure. Dead lift. Another
solid metric, by the way.

2341
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:18,600
Yeah. Raw strength. That's
what, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2342
02:36:18,670 --> 02:36:22,690
Cause consider a member by like when
you're a kid or maybe old school kind of

2343
02:36:22,691 --> 02:36:26,020
philosophy. It's like, hey, you know, you
get the old timer and he was like, whoa.

2344
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:29,740
Stronger you and you're like real
strong. We're sir. Okay. Pick that up.

2345
02:36:29,800 --> 02:36:32,560
You know what I mean? Okay. You can't
pick it up. You're weak. You can't,

2346
02:36:32,590 --> 02:36:34,180
you're strong.
And he comes and picks it up

2347
02:36:35,730 --> 02:36:38,200
and then the step two is
pick it up over your head.

2348
02:36:38,450 --> 02:36:42,870
You've got to dead lift the
deadlift. Yeah. Oh yeah. No,

2349
02:36:43,050 --> 02:36:45,750
just kidding. Yeah. Let's not do this.

2350
02:36:49,300 --> 02:36:53,630
Yay. That's good. But don't get too
nuts with that though. Who is that?

2351
02:36:53,640 --> 02:36:58,300
I was just talking to somebody. There
were lots of dead lifts. It was Ed. Yeah.

2352
02:36:58,301 --> 02:37:00,340
He was like, Hey, you know my
back and stuff. I was like,

2353
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:02,230
I don't get crazy with dead lifts.
No.

2354
02:37:02,440 --> 02:37:05,440
But you can talk to plenty
of people that say, Oh,

2355
02:37:05,441 --> 02:37:08,890
I had a bad back and I dead lifted
and now it's healed. Right, right.

2356
02:37:08,891 --> 02:37:12,090
Plenty of [inaudible] would say that
absolutely crazy with them because they

2357
02:37:12,350 --> 02:37:13,660
give you good gesture straight,

2358
02:37:13,780 --> 02:37:16,280
like your your backs and
bad a lot of times anyway,

2359
02:37:16,310 --> 02:37:19,580
even just anywhere in your core is because
when you have like some core or your

2360
02:37:19,581 --> 02:37:23,540
back or something, when you do
stuff, you adjust to that. Use it.

2361
02:37:23,850 --> 02:37:26,930
And it's a dead lift. Yeah,
because you don't use it anymore.

2362
02:37:26,931 --> 02:37:29,750
So now when you do something,
you're grabbing the cranberry
juice from this side.

2363
02:37:29,751 --> 02:37:33,030
You're going to put it over here.
You gotta like floor and you're like,

2364
02:37:33,050 --> 02:37:35,690
how did I do that?
Cranberry juice.

2365
02:37:38,320 --> 02:37:41,660
Sugar in a bottle broke. But you shouldn't
be. That's your body's way of telling.

2366
02:37:41,661 --> 02:37:45,770
You don't want that. Cool. Hey Man, I dig
it. Maybe you're grabbing it from here,

2367
02:37:45,771 --> 02:37:48,710
put it in the trashcan or something
like this. You know? I'm just saying.

2368
02:37:48,890 --> 02:37:52,190
That's why though. So you go
dead lift, not heavy, not crazy.

2369
02:37:52,310 --> 02:37:54,320
Just like your buddies like,
like you need lifting.

2370
02:37:54,321 --> 02:37:56,380
It's like your buddy just
getting used to it. So boom.

2371
02:37:56,381 --> 02:37:59,550
You used to picking stuff up and I
want to try it. Do it. I like it.

2372
02:37:59,720 --> 02:38:03,680
Try the kettle bells too. And if you
want the cool ones and when I say cool,

2373
02:38:03,681 --> 02:38:07,580
it's like you look at them and they're
cool, like irrefutably cool on it.

2374
02:38:07,790 --> 02:38:10,540
That's the ones the gorilla
want to actually don't do
the gorilla on this first.

2375
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,530
Do the chimp one first

2376
02:38:15,030 --> 02:38:17,930
straight to zombies.
We were just super strong,

2377
02:38:18,390 --> 02:38:23,390
doesn't have the same categories and I
forget what they're all called Zombie.

2378
02:38:23,750 --> 02:38:28,750
When I look at the legend versus the
gorilla ones or the primate ones too.

2379
02:38:29,780 --> 02:38:33,840
To the zombies. I wanted
the ones that look crazy and
evil. Yeah, that's no biggie.

2380
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:39,200
I think we both, we all collectively
know why you want the zombies.

2381
02:38:39,500 --> 02:38:43,130
Technically it's so, but that brings
up a good point in my opinion.

2382
02:38:43,910 --> 02:38:48,700
All the different categories, primal
bills, that's the champ, the, you know,

2383
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:52,850
all the things, different zombies,
all zombies, legends, Werewolf,

2384
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:57,440
cyclops, cyclops, like all the
legends. So boom, pick your category.

2385

of workout stuff like stuff, you know,

2388

get into a workout, maybe not you,

2389
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:15,380
you're not like this, but like I got
into the kettle bells and it became fun.

2390
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:18,740
You know, you know how like, um,
if something becomes fun for me,

2391
02:39:18,741 --> 02:39:21,410
I stopped doing it and do something
that sucks, but well, Dang this

2392
02:39:23,330 --> 02:39:24,530
psychologically challenging,

2393
02:39:25,070 --> 02:39:27,260
but they got all kind and they
have like the Macy's and you know,

2394
02:39:27,261 --> 02:39:28,730
all the workout stuff or whatever.
Anyway,

2395
02:39:28,760 --> 02:39:32,990
that's a go down on it.com/jocko check
out that stuff and man get after it.

2396
02:39:33,050 --> 02:39:34,210
Even if you're getting bored,

2397
02:39:34,220 --> 02:39:38,900
you've got some interesting stuff to
work out with. Highly recommend. Awesome.

2398
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:43,790
Also, if you like these books,
Pete didn't write a book.

2399
02:39:43,791 --> 02:39:48,410
Wait to have you written a book before and
I wouldn't be surprised.

2400
02:39:48,411 --> 02:39:53,411
I wrote along ass paper when I
couldn't sleep over the last year,

2401
02:39:53,601 --> 02:39:57,800
but total book. So yeah, little
bit different. But anyway.

2402
02:39:57,980 --> 02:40:02,000
A lot of times Jocko, we'll review books
on this podcast. People like to get them.

2403
02:40:02,930 --> 02:40:04,880
If you're one of those people out there,
go the website,

2404
02:40:04,881 --> 02:40:08,210
chocolate podcast.com section

2405
02:40:08,210 --> 02:40:10,960
Click through there to get the books.
That's a good way to support it.

2406
02:40:10,990 --> 02:40:14,460
Takes you to Amazon or if you're
doing any of the other shopping,

2407
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,650
do it through their big support.
Small actions. My action.

2408
02:40:19,651 --> 02:40:24,330
Big Reaction. Nice. Also,
subscribe to the podcast.

2409
02:40:26,250 --> 02:40:31,020
Google play. We still feel the need
to say that. Yeah, because what?

2410
02:40:31,590 --> 02:40:36,440
Some people aren't subscribed
in the event, you know it's it.

2411
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:41,070
I guess it's just our guests,
my guests. There's probably

2412
02:40:42,690 --> 02:40:46,980
hype type pot. This is speaking as
my hypothesis is what I'm saying.

2413
02:40:47,100 --> 02:40:50,160
There's probably a marginal group
who's like, Hey, who's Jocko?

2414
02:40:50,161 --> 02:40:53,400
I heard him on Joe Rogan, or I
don't know. I seen him on whatever,

2415
02:40:53,820 --> 02:40:56,490
and then I call him and listen to
the podcast. I was like, okay, cool.

2416
02:40:56,870 --> 02:41:01,710
Well listen to let me listen to another
one. Okay, cool. Maybe I'm not down.

2417
02:41:01,711 --> 02:41:06,390
You know, he's kind of weird or just
whatever they don't understand. Like, oh,

2418
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:10,350
I can subscribe to this, but I can just
get it'll, it'll tell me when it's coming.

2419
02:41:10,380 --> 02:41:13,590
Right. Cause a lot of people don't
listen to podcasts. Yeah. I know.

2420
02:41:13,670 --> 02:41:18,120
I got a question for you about that.
Have you thought about, cause you,

2421
02:41:18,250 --> 02:41:19,230
this is number 90.

2422
02:41:19,580 --> 02:41:24,580
Have you thought about breaking the
podcasts into categories to speak to your

2423
02:41:24,901 --> 02:41:29,670
audience because you cover such a broad
audience? Um, when you say breaking them,

2424
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:34,080
you just another section like
cutty had him up. No, no, no.

2425
02:41:34,110 --> 02:41:37,200
The full podcast where
you're covering books,

2426
02:41:37,201 --> 02:41:39,960
where you're talking about business,
where you're interviewing somebody,

2427
02:41:40,170 --> 02:41:43,710
breaking them up that way.
Yeah. They are a cent tech.

2428
02:41:44,220 --> 02:41:47,760
There's not a linear, right. You
don't have to listen from you. Right.

2429
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:51,390
I recommend when someone
says, Hey, you know,

2430
02:41:51,480 --> 02:41:54,660
I just heard your
podcast. I heard, I heard,

2431
02:41:54,810 --> 02:41:58,110
I just isn't that podcast you just put
out, I want to listen to the rest of them.

2432
02:41:58,380 --> 02:42:02,070
Should I go backwards? Should
I go forward? And I tell
people start at one and,

2433
02:42:02,230 --> 02:42:06,630
and, and most of the people that I
talked to that are into the podcast,

2434
02:42:06,840 --> 02:42:10,590
they're like, that's the
right advice. Tell people,
start at one. If I said Jocko,

2435
02:42:10,591 --> 02:42:15,591
I want to listen to your real
business related podcasts,

2436
02:42:15,900 --> 02:42:18,840
I couldn't, could I do that or
know what we are going to do?

2437
02:42:19,290 --> 02:42:23,580
And I have this in the background going
into something that I've been trying to

2438
02:42:23,581 --> 02:42:26,220
get done for a while is we're gonna
kind of archive where you're going to be

2439
02:42:26,221 --> 02:42:29,490
able to maybe figure out,
oh I want to listen to business.

2440
02:42:29,790 --> 02:42:32,490
Boom and here's a podcast,
a section.

2441
02:42:32,820 --> 02:42:37,140
Now whether or not we'd like chop them
up and put them into one group, um,

2442
02:42:37,350 --> 02:42:41,640
not yet. Not yet. Not yet.
Yeah. I mean it, you're, yeah,

2443
02:42:41,641 --> 02:42:44,370
it's not organized we'll say,
but you know,

2444
02:42:44,371 --> 02:42:46,470
it's one of those things you've
got to manually look, you know,

2445
02:42:46,471 --> 02:42:48,460
cause it'll say what it's
about. In fact, the Puck,

2446
02:42:48,510 --> 02:42:52,540
it's straight up by timestamp
talking about, you know,

2447
02:42:52,800 --> 02:42:56,130
that you can kind of do it that way. But
no, not organized. Like if, if you're,

2448
02:42:56,580 --> 02:42:57,570
and it makes sense though,

2449
02:42:57,690 --> 02:43:01,950
because if we're talking about a book
and people like what Love World War II

2450
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:07,040
love pull most 10 podcasts in world war
two and they can just get after it and

2451
02:43:07,051 --> 02:43:11,420
then maybe, you know, just an
idea. Good Idea Pete House.

2452
02:43:11,820 --> 02:43:14,980
Big Time. But yeah, subscribe. That's
a good one. If you haven't already.

2453
02:43:14,981 --> 02:43:18,400
How about that? If you haven't
already subscribed, that's
a good one. Also, youtube,

2454
02:43:18,401 --> 02:43:21,910
subscribe to Allen
Nouns a little bit more.

2455
02:43:22,480 --> 02:43:25,340
Like make sense to be
like, hey, subscribe to,

2456
02:43:25,570 --> 02:43:28,900
and the big thing that you might not know
is if you're not subscribed to youtube,

2457
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:32,200
there could be things that
are not in the podcast. Yeah.

2458
02:43:32,740 --> 02:43:35,110
So let's say you liked the podcasts,
you're listening to it and you go, yeah,

2459
02:43:35,111 --> 02:43:38,170
well I've heard all the podcasts. I don't
need to get youtube. You're wrong. Yeah.

2460
02:43:38,440 --> 02:43:43,440
Because there could be things
released into the youtube.

2461
02:43:44,760 --> 02:43:49,120
I have not been released, for instance,
deleted scenes, deleted scene,

2462
02:43:49,121 --> 02:43:52,900
which is us talking some off the record
about things like people that have

2463
02:43:52,901 --> 02:43:55,690
certain, you know, what issues,

2464
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:02,530
uh, nothing, bro. Lack of
squatting issues. Brassy.

2465
02:44:02,710 --> 02:44:06,330
Yeah. And I said I had stopped
squatting because of blockchain.

2466
02:44:06,520 --> 02:44:11,230
The technically the story goes, I stop
squatting because my wife said, hey,

2467
02:44:11,231 --> 02:44:13,810
your legs are like real
big and it looks weird.

2468
02:44:13,960 --> 02:44:16,610
That's funny cause my wife said
you're starting to get an old man but

2469
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:22,320
cold the same thing me,

2470
02:44:23,020 --> 02:44:27,710
I don't know dude. Dang. Just
like it though. I'm squatting.

2471
02:44:27,711 --> 02:44:32,490
You need to get all the songs but
like kettle bell swings. Bull.

2472
02:44:32,590 --> 02:44:35,450
Yeah. That's what they
say. They say that the,

2473
02:44:35,451 --> 02:44:40,451
the regular or the Russian kettlebell
swings posterior chain a new day.

2474
02:44:41,380 --> 02:44:45,910
I learned that either way.
Yeah, the deleted scenes.

2475
02:44:45,911 --> 02:44:49,480
That's what he was giving me shit about,
cause I stopped squatting.

2476
02:44:49,630 --> 02:44:53,350
Actually I didn't stop squatting.
I stop squatting like hardcore legs.

2477
02:44:53,440 --> 02:44:57,320
You know what I'm saying? He stops
crying. He said the point is,

2478
02:44:57,321 --> 02:44:59,030
is you stopped squatting

2479
02:45:01,630 --> 02:45:05,740
deleted scenes or on their
uh, excerpts to, you know,
like let's say you were like,

2480
02:45:05,741 --> 02:45:08,860
Hey, I liked that part and people
still email me about that by the way.

2481
02:45:09,150 --> 02:45:11,680
What are like, Hey, what was that
part? Or what episode was that?

2482
02:45:11,681 --> 02:45:14,920
From that part where it, whatever.
So instead of having to scour,

2483
02:45:16,920 --> 02:45:20,080
share that excerpts,
easy to find. So yeah,

2484
02:45:20,081 --> 02:45:23,680
that's a good and subscribe to
youtube also. Jocko is a store,

2485
02:45:23,980 --> 02:45:27,940
it's called Jocko store Jocko store.com.
Guess what's on there?

2486
02:45:28,510 --> 02:45:33,130
Everything.
Potentially everything.

2487
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:37,270
But as of right now, there's some
shirts on their women's stuff,

2488
02:45:37,271 --> 02:45:41,260
on their patches on there. You know, you
put them on your hat, interchangeable,

2489
02:45:41,261 --> 02:45:45,250
velcro patches if you
will. Rash guards. Awesome.

2490
02:45:46,600 --> 02:45:48,220
So now they have two options,
Huh?

2491
02:45:49,030 --> 02:45:53,290
Jocko rash guards get after
it to trooper darkness.

2492
02:45:53,291 --> 02:45:57,760
Rash guards and origin rash guards. Yeah.
Just like that. The selection just vast.

2493
02:45:58,050 --> 02:46:02,620
Yeah. And eventually they're going
to be right. And this will be, we'll,

2494
02:46:02,630 --> 02:46:07,630
it'll all be kind of melt together
as one big vast place to just go.

2495
02:46:08,340 --> 02:46:12,980
And these going to be a melting
pot of Awesomeness, right? Yes,

2496
02:46:13,010 --> 02:46:17,870
indeed. Indeed. Yeah. All that. So,

2497
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:21,140
and some hoodies on there.
Yeah.

2498
02:46:21,980 --> 02:46:25,160
I think we should consult. No.
[inaudible] I'm going to tell you,

2499
02:46:25,640 --> 02:46:28,830
I already know what he's gonna
say. He's from Hawaii. What,

2500
02:46:28,840 --> 02:46:30,470
you want a lightweight Hoodie? No, he, he,

2501
02:46:30,471 --> 02:46:33,050
so he made hoodies and I'm from New
England. That's all. It's like, oh,

2502
02:46:33,051 --> 02:46:33,591
you make a Hoodie,

2503
02:46:33,591 --> 02:46:37,190
you can wear it in like a full fledge
Arctic storm and you're going to have a

2504
02:46:37,191 --> 02:46:41,660
heavyweight cotton hoodie. So his, his
hoodies are, are, are light. They're,

2505
02:46:41,690 --> 02:46:44,240
they're cool for so cal.
Yeah, they're good for Hawaii.

2506
02:46:44,270 --> 02:46:47,570
If you even have hoodies in Hawaii,
they're like a fall Hoodie I guess.

2507
02:46:47,780 --> 02:46:49,880
And even that's like,
my guess. I don't know.

2508
02:46:49,881 --> 02:46:51,860
That's why I'm saying we should consult.
I mean his,

2509
02:46:51,861 --> 02:46:56,710
his like his consultation things
when I consult him like, Hey, it's,

2510
02:46:56,830 --> 02:47:00,890
it's like mixed in with a scolding.
So, you know, I get the scolding first,

2511
02:47:00,891 --> 02:47:02,450
then the info like maybe

2512
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:09,590
I want to make a really, really bad
ass flat locked Hoodie or to do it.

2513
02:47:09,620 --> 02:47:12,770
What is a flat, what does that, wait
a sec. That seemed Hoodie. Well,

2514
02:47:12,771 --> 02:47:14,050
how could we possibly do that?

2515
02:47:14,080 --> 02:47:16,820
[inaudible] where are we
going to get someone that
knows how to make flat locked?

2516
02:47:16,910 --> 02:47:21,660
Awesome. Badass hoodies. Hm. Oh wait,
we're sitting. Get him a factory

2517
02:47:23,180 --> 02:47:26,610
where we can make it happen.
The big one. There you go.

2518
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:31,490
That's good stuff also. Hmm.
Psychological warfare. Previously,

2519
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:36,780
a few minutes ago we talked about
joint warfare for joint degeneration.

2520
02:47:37,410 --> 02:47:40,640
In summation, all that stuff.
Overall, real generous.

2521
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:43,610
Generally supplementation for your body.
Yeah.

2522
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:47,150
Sometimes you need supplementation for
your mind. Your mind. Yes. Full on.

2523
02:47:47,151 --> 02:47:51,260
So in your campaign against weakness,
psychological weakness,

2524
02:47:51,261 --> 02:47:55,250
you know you're trying to get up
every day, right? Stick to the Diet.

2525
02:47:55,251 --> 02:47:59,780
Can that help me with eating
multiple whoopie pies?

2526
02:47:59,890 --> 02:48:04,270
Yes. Yes, yes. Actually, there
isn't a specific tab for this.

2527
02:48:05,120 --> 02:48:09,170
I'm definitely interested in that because
that's been my one struggle as a human.

2528
02:48:09,171 --> 02:48:11,630
What is a whoopie pie?
I will be pies.

2529
02:48:12,140 --> 02:48:15,520
Like cake and whipped cream.
Right?

2530
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,520
Like a fig Newton commercial
cause kick some ass.

2531
02:48:20,150 --> 02:48:22,640
Fig Newton is like if you put
those two next to each other,

2532
02:48:22,641 --> 02:48:26,420
they're in different planets. Exactly.
The plants. Newton's were healthy though.

2533
02:48:26,750 --> 02:48:30,620
Allegedly. They're actually just a
big giant blocks of sugar, sugar cane,

2534
02:48:30,650 --> 02:48:34,070
which is pretty much what it will be.
Bias, which is why my homie over here,

2535
02:48:34,910 --> 02:48:37,850
you've got a kid. I'm a single
parent family, four kids.

2536
02:48:37,851 --> 02:48:40,610
We were fighting over the food in the
house too. I've never broken out of that.

2537
02:48:40,730 --> 02:48:44,530
And the Whoopie Pie, we need
a break. We can, we can worse,

2538
02:48:44,630 --> 02:48:49,470
we can introduce you to attract called
sugarcoated lives. Really? Yeah.

2539
02:48:49,730 --> 02:48:51,940
Yeah. I get very
interested in that. We'll,

2540
02:48:51,950 --> 02:48:55,140
we'll get you on the
[inaudible] week there. Yeah.

2541
02:48:55,310 --> 02:48:59,360
And you'd think it'd be like Jocko
yelling at you, like don't, whatever.

2542
02:48:59,361 --> 02:49:03,800
But it's a pragmatic explanation of what
your mind is doing right now and what

2543
02:49:03,801 --> 02:49:08,490
it shouldn't be doing and what it should
be doing and psychological warfare that

2544
02:49:08,491 --> 02:49:12,570
can help you with that. Basically.
You mentioned that it's an album,

2545
02:49:12,730 --> 02:49:17,460
it's an oh yeah, yeah. It's an
album with tracks on iTunes,

2546
02:49:17,490 --> 02:49:21,590
Jocko tracks, iTunes, Amazon
music, like all these things. Yeah.

2547
02:49:21,780 --> 02:49:25,400
MP three and you know what you, you're
probably sitting here thinking like, okay,

2548
02:49:25,620 --> 02:49:27,840
that's a neat little idea that,
you know,

2549
02:49:28,050 --> 02:49:30,930
echo came up with and made Jack
would do this and Oh, cool.

2550
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:36,530
That album number one spoken
word album on iTunes for,

2551
02:49:39,600 --> 02:49:43,710
I don't know, I lost 38 straight
weeks to kidding me. Number one.

2552
02:49:43,830 --> 02:49:47,880
That's bad ass. No big deal. You
know, Shit. Yeah, it's awesome.

2553
02:49:48,390 --> 02:49:52,920
And I will say that when echo is like,
dude, you just got, you know, just, just,

2554
02:49:52,921 --> 02:49:55,260
you know, these things that I'm asking
you about, what you kind of just like,

2555
02:49:55,650 --> 02:49:59,010
you know, hammering and I'll just record
it. But it's basically like, okay,

2556
02:49:59,011 --> 02:50:01,990
so I used to have this
thing, you stew, not anymore.

2557
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:03,660
Had this thing where you don't,
when you're like, okay, I'm,

2558
02:50:03,661 --> 02:50:05,070
I'm working out this
day, this day, you know,

2559
02:50:05,071 --> 02:50:09,510
I'm just through this day and when it
comes time to workout and I have a gym at

2560
02:50:09,511 --> 02:50:13,680
my house now, so I'm like, ah, maybe I'll,
I'll do it. I meant to do it at noon.

2561
02:50:13,740 --> 02:50:15,030
I'm going to do it tonight.
I want,

2562
02:50:15,031 --> 02:50:17,400
I don't feel like doing it wrong and
do it tonight. And then, you know,

2563
02:50:17,401 --> 02:50:19,650
accountability.
Nobody's watching.

2564
02:50:20,040 --> 02:50:23,200
You can do what you want when I
feel like it a little bit marching,

2565
02:50:23,201 --> 02:50:26,910
some coffee mate, whatever. It's right
outside, you know, can I totally get it?

2566
02:50:27,290 --> 02:50:30,240
And that, that, that night
turns into hail, do it tomorrow.

2567
02:50:30,241 --> 02:50:33,300
So you basically turn a
workout day into a rest days.

2568
02:50:33,620 --> 02:50:37,560
You turn on your motivation to get
it done. Yeah, and it's, again,

2569
02:50:37,561 --> 02:50:40,860
it's not like a motivational
thing. It's like, okay, this is,

2570
02:50:41,370 --> 02:50:45,090
it's Jocko saying it so, okay, there's
that, but it's like, it's saying, okay,

2571
02:50:45,091 --> 02:50:48,540
this is what's going on right now.
This is what you're thinking right now.

2572
02:50:48,690 --> 02:50:50,160
This is what you shouldn't
be thinking right now.

2573
02:50:50,161 --> 02:50:53,460
This is what you should be thinking right
now. Okay. There you go. Cool. Gotcha.

2574
02:50:53,490 --> 02:50:54,323
It's when you're like,
oh,

2575
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:59,410
the thing that I find about them is
because it is me talking. I find it there.

2576
02:50:59,480 --> 02:51:03,960
They're very,
very tight arguments.

2577
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:07,170
Yeah. You'll get done listening
and you go, you know what, man?

2578
02:51:07,171 --> 02:51:09,150
I still find a little hole
in his argument. You know?

2579
02:51:09,330 --> 02:51:12,260
I think there's one sugarcoat who's
one will be buys it and not going to be

2580
02:51:12,261 --> 02:51:13,440
happy. I know you're like, you know what?

2581
02:51:13,441 --> 02:51:16,090
This is a big deal and I'm
sitting there will be biocide.

2582
02:51:16,340 --> 02:51:20,610
Know you might be the ultimate test
case. Yeah. I will be the ultimate.

2583
02:51:20,630 --> 02:51:23,700
I don't care. I don't
care who's around me, Ben.

2584
02:51:23,701 --> 02:51:27,660
If I get this craving for sugar, we
were traveling the other day. What?

2585
02:51:27,661 --> 02:51:32,340
I get sweet tea. Oh
Dang. Why sugar, sugar,

2586
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:36,990
sugar. But keep in mind I'm going to ruin,

2587
02:51:36,991 --> 02:51:41,080
you know your mom is, I
know I can't, you know,

2588
02:51:41,610 --> 02:51:45,480
you're like, hey, you want to try these
things and I, I know what it is. And,

2589
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:48,670
and you said, man, you got to try this
sparkle ball. My Mom's coming back though,

2590
02:51:48,690 --> 02:51:51,350
bro. I know it's sweet, right? And
you go, Oh yeah, yeah it is. And I go,

2591
02:51:51,900 --> 02:51:55,290
you never had spartan balaclava yeah,
I was like, you know, could, you know,

2592
02:51:55,291 --> 02:51:58,930
no big deal. And, and you know, we've
been lately been saying like, you know,

2593
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:03,180
a discipline won't allow it.
That's between pizza. When we,

2594
02:52:03,330 --> 02:52:06,070
when we maybe see each other
maybe a path that we shouldn't

2595
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:09,980
be taking, we're going off the path and
onto the path of weakness. You know,

2596
02:52:09,990 --> 02:52:12,190
how might be like, Hey Echo, you
know, that's cool and everything,

2597
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:16,870
but the discipline won't allow that. Oh
man, that's awesome. You know yesterday,

2598
02:52:16,871 --> 02:52:21,871
you know you're dangling this custom
homemade lavar and my mom's there and your

2599
02:52:23,951 --> 02:52:27,070
mom's there actually like,
and I know I can see her.

2600
02:52:27,071 --> 02:52:32,071
She looks like she arrived from Greece
three days ago to make the buck of off.

2601
02:52:34,690 --> 02:52:36,730
I'm like, okay, I'll have one. Right.

2602
02:52:36,731 --> 02:52:41,731
So I had one yesterday and then the
discipline wouldn't allow anymore today I

2603
02:52:41,741 --> 02:52:46,060
had nine of them.
I think I have three of them today.

2604
02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:49,900
I have three of them sugarcoated lies.
Balaclavas get some.

2605
02:52:50,050 --> 02:52:54,150
My Mom's is going to get
called to make baklava origin.

2606
02:52:54,151 --> 02:52:56,330
Ballclub are pretty serious maple syrup.

2607
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,330
But yeah. But keep in mind
though, with these tracks,

2608
02:53:01,510 --> 02:53:05,530
you got to be on that path though. It's
not like you're like, hey, I eat too much.

2609
02:53:05,531 --> 02:53:07,780
Let me listen to this track.
It's not that. It's the, okay,

2610
02:53:07,781 --> 02:53:11,460
my plan is to straight up clean up
my whole shit like by my plan is.

2611
02:53:11,461 --> 02:53:14,950
So you've already found a bit of
motivation. Yes. Yeah. You're motivated.

2612
02:53:14,951 --> 02:53:19,240
You're on the path or already,
but it's on the weakness moments,

2613
02:53:19,241 --> 02:53:21,700
the moments of weakness. You're like,
okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna arrest today.

2614
02:53:21,701 --> 02:53:26,500
I'm going to, you know, whatever. Is
that kind of, I do. We all do. We all do.

2615
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:31,480
That's, that's probably why a lot of
people get that album with tracks.

2616
02:53:33,910 --> 02:53:36,730
You ration what I used to do. No, no.
What I would do is this. I'd be like,

2617
02:53:37,630 --> 02:53:39,280
especially when I was
training for competition,

2618
02:53:40,090 --> 02:53:44,290
I'm going to eat this whoopie pie. I
would eat it and that would run two miles.

2619
02:53:44,730 --> 02:53:49,480
Yeah. I was being earned it
frigging right. Yeah. I do that too,

2620
02:53:50,160 --> 02:53:51,170
like it.

2621
02:53:51,400 --> 02:53:55,900
Normally I try and pre empt
weakness with hardcore exercise,

2622
02:53:56,170 --> 02:54:00,400
which by the way often mitigates.
It takes like a like, oh,

2623
02:54:00,401 --> 02:54:02,140
I want to have a mint
chocolate chip milkshake. Cool.

2624
02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:04,210
I can have a mint
chocolate chip milkshake.

2625
02:54:04,450 --> 02:54:08,470
As soon as I do 30 clean
and jerks at the bar down,

2626
02:54:08,590 --> 02:54:13,090
I can do that and that's cool, but then
by the time you get done, you're like,

2627
02:54:13,091 --> 02:54:14,140
you know what?
I'm going to want that thing.

2628
02:54:14,590 --> 02:54:18,010
I infuse my brain with
discipline from the bar.

2629
02:54:18,160 --> 02:54:22,300
They went from the bar into my hands
and into my brain and so that's a great

2630
02:54:22,330 --> 02:54:26,890
idea. Yeah. Even in the simplest
one is burry burpees like, okay,

2631
02:54:27,130 --> 02:54:27,550
you know what,

2632
02:54:27,550 --> 02:54:31,960
I can have this if I do a hundred
burpees that takes less than 10 minutes.

2633
02:54:32,830 --> 02:54:34,600
We had this thing the other
day and I talked about it.

2634
02:54:35,590 --> 02:54:38,680
My freezer in my house
broke and so we had,

2635
02:54:38,710 --> 02:54:43,710
I have an RV and our frozen food was in
the RV refrigerator and I wanted some

2636
02:54:45,430 --> 02:54:48,830
ice cream and then I was like, ah,
you know it's all the way up. Get it.

2637
02:54:49,270 --> 02:54:52,840
And I said to myself, God, wow, lazy
loser. You don't even deserve ice cream.

2638
02:54:52,841 --> 02:54:55,150
I didn't have it cause I said,
you're a pathetic,

2639
02:54:55,360 --> 02:54:58,500
if you're actually questioning whether
it's worth it, Geico to be our call,

2640
02:54:58,870 --> 02:55:01,330
you don't need this at all in any way,
shape or form.

2641
02:55:01,420 --> 02:55:04,550
If you were thinking it wasn't
worth 27 steps to get to the RV,

2642
02:55:04,551 --> 02:55:07,670
grabbed the mint chocolate chip
Bryers ice cream, bring it back down,

2643
02:55:07,760 --> 02:55:08,960
scoop it into a bowl,

2644
02:55:09,230 --> 02:55:12,400
let it melt a little bit and then
just sit there and get after it.

2645
02:55:17,340 --> 02:55:20,370
So good. You're like a little melt
to the ice cream. Just a little mail.

2646
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:24,530
I don't like it if I ever
had to turn gains bowl. No.

2647
02:55:24,531 --> 02:55:29,070
Have you ever heard that term
gains ball? Uh, it's, it's you,

2648
02:55:29,110 --> 02:55:33,840
you basically take ice cream
and you put milk in it. Oh,

2649
02:55:33,960 --> 02:55:38,390
stirred around Gainesville.
That's what I do. But let's,

2650
02:55:39,200 --> 02:55:42,170
let's all detach right now and consider
what we're talking about right now.

2651
02:55:42,200 --> 02:55:47,150
The pleasures of gains bowl.
The problem is chocolate chip ice cream.

2652
02:55:48,020 --> 02:55:51,260
I would walk barefoot and two
feet of snow to that frigging RV.

2653
02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:53,630
Look at this guy.
No,

2654
02:55:53,631 --> 02:55:58,430
he was that compliment that or is that a
negative or positive? No, yours is worse.

2655
02:55:58,460 --> 02:56:00,590
It's weird because you
have a better result,

2656
02:56:00,591 --> 02:56:04,280
but your discord or your path is
where, cause he was like, Hey,

2657
02:56:04,281 --> 02:56:09,230
I'm going to be weak. I have discipline
that week to week. That was him that day.

2658
02:56:09,680 --> 02:56:11,900
But you could,
that's rationalize because at the end,

2659
02:56:11,950 --> 02:56:16,340
you know the means and the end situation
thing is I actually embarrassed myself.

2660
02:56:16,350 --> 02:56:19,040
Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was.
I just hated myself. And I said,

2661
02:56:19,160 --> 02:56:24,020
I can't believe I'm even questioning the
fact if I would take 27 steps to my arm,

2662
02:56:24,170 --> 02:56:27,300
get the ice cream, the fact that I'm
even thinking that way, I should,

2663
02:56:28,640 --> 02:56:29,990
I should Hayes myself.

2664
02:56:30,680 --> 02:56:34,970
This is ridiculous and pathetic
and just stop. And so yeah,

2665
02:56:34,971 --> 02:56:36,500
I didn't get the ice cream that night,

2666
02:56:36,680 --> 02:56:40,130
but the mint chocolate
chip ice cream for sure is,

2667
02:56:40,250 --> 02:56:45,170
is a real thing. And it's
even, it's my favorite flavor

2668
02:56:47,290 --> 02:56:51,230
is my flavors. Although when I was in
Montana, who's tracks those tracks?

2669
02:56:52,310 --> 02:56:56,870
Moose tracks, that's the other, that's
the other. I'm not going to, you know,

2670
02:56:56,890 --> 02:57:00,110
I am going to stand and I thought,
and I dig it, but it's just,

2671
02:57:00,111 --> 02:57:03,320
it's very surprising that
the way

2672
02:57:04,910 --> 02:57:08,840
you can close the Moose track with
a scoop of mint chocolate chip.

2673
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:13,060
I've never done that. That sounds
deranged. It's like it would push me over.

2674
02:57:13,061 --> 02:57:18,040
He says, Jesus, a cheese and wine
grapes. Oh Jeez. Just clothes.

2675
02:57:18,050 --> 02:57:22,100
It's just a finishing touch is what we
should do. Is that what we should do now?

2676
02:57:22,460 --> 02:57:27,460
One of my buddies in the trees
or is it is a awesome guy.

2677
02:57:28,570 --> 02:57:29,620
Bad ass wrestler.

2678
02:57:30,260 --> 02:57:34,970
Wrestled was a champion wrestler in
college and it was on the Olympic team.

2679
02:57:35,200 --> 02:57:38,610
Uh, didn't compete for variety of
reasons that I won't talk about. Uh,

2680
02:57:38,840 --> 02:57:43,320
but he was friends with Dan
Severn. You remember Danny
saw? Yeah. Early UFC and so,

2681
02:57:43,940 --> 02:57:46,910
and so. I don't know why this just
came to my mind. Oh, I know why I did.

2682
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:49,730
So he would say they knew each other,

2683
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:52,640
they were friends and whenever
he'd see Danny Severn,

2684
02:57:52,641 --> 02:57:57,440
Danny [inaudible] was a heavyweight and
this buddy of mine was cutting weight,

2685
02:57:57,460 --> 02:57:59,390
you know, and when he was a
big guy, he was like whatever,

2686
02:57:59,570 --> 02:58:01,770
like 200 pounds be to
cut to one you whenever.

2687
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:05,850
And he would call Dan Severn pot liquor.

2688
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:09,600
Meaning like meaning like you're, you're
just, you're a guy that's over there.

2689
02:58:09,601 --> 02:58:12,270
You're eating everything and when you
get done eating, you're licking the pot.

2690
02:58:12,560 --> 02:58:15,240
Right.
I picture you with a smile.

2691
02:58:15,250 --> 02:58:19,290
You got straight up palm liquor cause
you get to the end of that bowl,

2692
02:58:19,300 --> 02:58:21,160
you're like,
oh I'm getting the,

2693
02:58:21,180 --> 02:58:24,930
the rest of this mint chocolate chip
ice cream is getting into my belly now.

2694
02:58:25,890 --> 02:58:30,890
My kids have followed the path of my
wife and they'll come up to me when I'm

2695
02:58:33,931 --> 02:58:37,680
eating junk food and they'd
be like, Dad, you got moves

2696
02:58:39,340 --> 02:58:43,140
that and they'll just grab of that
fat on my guts. You don't need that.

2697
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:47,640
Oh they're brutal. Dang.
Kind of the psychological
warfare situation. Yeah it is.

2698
02:58:47,641 --> 02:58:50,490
I'm surprised you're
not sometimes 84 pounds.

2699
02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:55,460
I should be scarred mentally actually.
Whoa.

2700
02:58:55,461 --> 02:58:57,090
What do we say?
That's the freedom part.

2701
02:58:57,120 --> 02:59:00,140
But the thing is he got to be
on the path. So like, yeah.

2702
02:59:00,200 --> 02:59:02,270
You know how say discipline
equals freedom, right?

2703
02:59:02,280 --> 02:59:04,470
So you know you grab the ice cream.
Yeah,

2704
02:59:05,260 --> 02:59:08,070
I had to pull that one for
the first time I was at,

2705
02:59:08,250 --> 02:59:12,990
I was a little like family
get together and there was,

2706
02:59:13,110 --> 02:59:15,300
it was a birthday party for a friend
of the family, blah, blah blah.

2707
02:59:15,450 --> 02:59:18,780
And there was a grandmother there.
So a grandmother of one of these kids.

2708
02:59:18,781 --> 02:59:20,910
I had a birthday party,
blah blah blah. So,

2709
02:59:20,911 --> 02:59:23,800
and she's a German woman and you know,

2710
02:59:23,820 --> 02:59:26,220
she kind of knows what's going
on a little bit with the game.

2711
02:59:26,221 --> 02:59:27,870
What with what's going on with everything.

2712
02:59:28,290 --> 02:59:32,580
And so I'm sitting there and there's
like a um, you know, straight up,

2713
02:59:32,610 --> 02:59:36,690
this is rough. You know the ice cream
cakes as you can get a mic check.

2714
02:59:36,690 --> 02:59:40,890
Do I know we have ice cream cake is a
mint chocolate chip ice cream cake talking

2715
02:59:40,891 --> 02:59:45,420
to a fat kid. So I'm like, if
we're talking to a pot liquor, so,

2716
02:59:45,570 --> 02:59:47,220
so I'm like, okay, you know what,

2717
02:59:47,221 --> 02:59:49,230
we're going to get some of that mint
chocolate chip ice cream. It's got those,

2718
02:59:49,231 --> 02:59:50,250
what?
I don't even know what it is.

2719
02:59:50,251 --> 02:59:54,910
Those little black Crum things that Oreo
or something like something like that

2720
02:59:55,500 --> 02:59:59,360
on there too. We're talking, this is a
situation that needs to be, you know, we,

2721
02:59:59,520 --> 03:00:03,210
we need to get in on this thing real
quick and he's a little bit melted so it's

2722
03:00:03,211 --> 03:00:06,270
soft. So anyways, I'm cutting a piece
of the cake and not a big piece,

2723
03:00:06,360 --> 03:00:09,150
not a small piece, but you know, like
a medium piece. Getting it on my plate,

2724
03:00:09,300 --> 03:00:13,500
stick my fork in it. And this woman is
German woman who's super cool. She's like,

2725
03:00:13,650 --> 03:00:17,490
I thought you were about the
discipline. And I was like, Dang.

2726
03:00:18,200 --> 03:00:21,330
And she called me out and uh, I
looked at her, I said, you know what?

2727
03:00:22,020 --> 03:00:27,020
I have the discipline and that allows
me to have freedom sometimes to eat mint

2728
03:00:28,500 --> 03:00:31,350
chocolate chip ice cream cakes,
which I'm about to do. Thank you.

2729
03:00:32,990 --> 03:00:36,690
That's it. Just say this is the
freedom park. But like I said,

2730
03:00:36,691 --> 03:00:39,240
you gotta be on the path. You gotta be
in the game. You can't just be like,

2731
03:00:39,241 --> 03:00:42,120
this is the freedom part every
single day. No, it doesn't work.

2732
03:00:42,130 --> 03:00:46,680
That doesn't work that way. Um, also
Jocko white tea, you can get that.

2733
03:00:46,710 --> 03:00:49,810
You know what it does if you're
gonna start dead lifting again, you,

2734
03:00:49,930 --> 03:00:53,820
you should get drink a little bit more
Jocko white tea because it will increase

2735
03:00:53,821 --> 03:00:57,030
your dead lift to 8,000 pounds.
And this is proven,

2736
03:00:57,690 --> 03:01:01,420
proven across the board. I'm
on it. Uh, everyone, uh, books,

2737
03:01:01,960 --> 03:01:02,830
I got some books.

2738
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:07,950
If you want to get them extreme ownership
book about leadership book about

2739
03:01:08,381 --> 03:01:12,110
combat leadership,
you can get that,

2740
03:01:12,290 --> 03:01:15,530
you can get it for yourself and you can
get it for your team and you can get it

2741
03:01:15,531 --> 03:01:18,770
for above and below you
in the chain of command.

2742
03:01:18,800 --> 03:01:20,930
It's gonna make your life easier
when everyone is on board.

2743
03:01:22,550 --> 03:01:25,760
If you got kids or you know,
kids, you can pick them up.

2744
03:01:25,761 --> 03:01:30,761
A book called the way of the warrior
kid and what that's gonna do is going to

2745
03:01:31,400 --> 03:01:35,130
lay out a path,
actually a yeah,

2746
03:01:35,510 --> 03:01:40,070
that a kid who doesn't have a path,
most kids don't have a path.

2747
03:01:40,430 --> 03:01:44,930
The book will give them the path and
the path leads them to being stronger,

2748
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:49,670
smarter and better.
So my daughter read it,

2749
03:01:49,671 --> 03:01:52,380
she loved it. That is awesome. And she is

2750
03:01:54,560 --> 03:01:59,300
an individual and she speaks
her mind. And I was like,

2751
03:01:59,301 --> 03:02:02,660
Chloe, no, really? What each
thing, she goes, I love that book.

2752
03:02:03,230 --> 03:02:06,860
And she came up and she wanted you to
sign it and she wanted me to get her

2753
03:02:06,861 --> 03:02:11,030
coffee back at home today or shite fails.
We get it tomorrow or something.

2754
03:02:11,260 --> 03:02:15,440
I'll be back tomorrow. Awesome.
Uh, that's, yeah, I appreciate it.

2755
03:02:15,680 --> 03:02:19,220
And Yeah, straight up, like when
you ask kids, how did you like it,

2756
03:02:19,221 --> 03:02:22,910
which I always ask kids how they like it
and cause you know, kids, like you said,

2757
03:02:22,911 --> 03:02:27,850
kids are going to tell you the truth. And
so, so far I have not had a kid go, eh,

2758
03:02:27,890 --> 03:02:31,970
marginal March and hold,
you know, marginal.

2759
03:02:32,630 --> 03:02:36,660
You kind of missed the mark, but you
know, we'll entertaining, but you know,

2760
03:02:36,661 --> 03:02:39,070
whatever, they should make that
shit into a movie or something. Oh,

2761
03:02:39,170 --> 03:02:43,220
they're going to make it into a movie.
Um, also another book coming out,

2762
03:02:43,280 --> 03:02:47,000
October 17th,
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2763
03:02:48,680 --> 03:02:53,030
That will also show you the
path it's going to show you the,

2764
03:02:53,330 --> 03:02:55,580
it's going to show you one path.

2765
03:02:56,690 --> 03:02:59,480
The path of discipline grabbed that book

2766
03:03:01,950 --> 03:03:05,170
if you need help of your business.
Uh,

2767
03:03:05,340 --> 03:03:10,340
I have a business called echelon front
with my brother Leif Babin and he was,

2768
03:03:12,060 --> 03:03:15,810
we worked together in the
seal teams battle of Ramadi.

2769
03:03:16,170 --> 03:03:17,430
We took the lessons that we learned,

2770
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:21,570
we wrote that book extreme ownership and
the reason we wrote that book extreme

2771
03:03:21,571 --> 03:03:25,740
ownership was because we had people that
we were consulting asking us to write

2772
03:03:25,741 --> 03:03:29,310
down the lessons learned, so there it
is. If you want us to come work with you,

2773
03:03:29,370 --> 03:03:33,990
it's Leif Babin, me,
JP Denelle, Dave Burke,

2774
03:03:34,050 --> 03:03:35,040

2776

Diego,
California.

2777
03:03:46,980 --> 03:03:49,680
We could throw out the like game changer,

2778
03:03:49,710 --> 03:03:52,290
which definitely has been said about it,
but I'm going to say this,

2779
03:03:53,990 --> 03:03:57,050
it's not this fantasy game changer thing.

2780
03:03:57,320 --> 03:04:02,320
It's actual pragmatic tactics and
strategies that you can use as a leader,

2781
03:04:04,400 --> 03:04:07,760
as a follower in business and in life.

2782
03:04:09,830 --> 03:04:12,320

We can all be found on some thing
that we talked about earlier tonight.

2788
03:04:33,060 --> 03:04:36,720
The interwebs. Sure. Twitter,

2789

flexibility to live this life,

2806
03:05:52,330 --> 03:05:57,010
which is important in a relationship.

that family

2809
03:06:06,970 --> 03:06:09,850
good things come in.
Yeah.

2810
03:06:10,660 --> 03:06:12,700
Well for me,
you know,

2811
03:06:12,910 --> 03:06:17,020
I wish I would have met you 20 years
ago and for whatever reason I didn't,

2812
03:06:17,260 --> 03:06:19,510
I wish I would have met you 10
years ago for whatever reason.

2813
03:06:19,511 --> 03:06:22,360
I didn't met you six months ago.

2814
03:06:22,630 --> 03:06:26,170
And just looking at what you've
done, I'm telling you, and if,

2815
03:06:26,200 --> 03:06:28,450
if I haven't made it
perfectly clear today,

2816
03:06:28,750 --> 03:06:33,610
what you've done to this
point already is incredible.

2817
03:06:34,120 --> 03:06:36,160
I don't,
I don't even,

2818
03:06:36,580 --> 03:06:41,350
it's the possibilities of you pulling
off what you've already pulled off is

2819
03:06:41,351 --> 03:06:44,650
incredible. And what's, what's cool
is it's like when, uh, when, uh,

2820
03:06:44,920 --> 03:06:46,660
when a space shuttle takes off,

2821
03:06:47,230 --> 03:06:51,580
the hardest part of the journey is that
first part getting breaking away from

2822
03:06:51,610 --> 03:06:53,860
gravity of Earth and
what you've already done,

2823
03:06:53,861 --> 03:06:58,380
you've cleared the gravity earth and now
you're on track and it's, it's, you know,

2824
03:06:58,470 --> 03:07:00,960
just nothing but respect for what you did.

2825
03:07:00,960 --> 03:07:04,770
I know that you have used your
hands to make this happen,

2826
03:07:04,980 --> 03:07:09,930
your mind to make this happen. And I just
respect everything you've done so far.

2827
03:07:10,200 --> 03:07:14,070
Talking to the team here and
the attitude that they have,

2828
03:07:14,280 --> 03:07:16,800
everybody has that attitude.
And,

2829
03:07:16,830 --> 03:07:21,270
and just for me to come in and be
a part of that is just outstanding.

2830
03:07:21,330 --> 03:07:24,000
I look forward to being
a part of this team.

2831
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:27,240
I look forward to getting to know
the team when I can come up here,

2832
03:07:27,241 --> 03:07:28,074
which is hard.

2833
03:07:28,380 --> 03:07:32,950
But to see the people on this team is,
is,

2834
03:07:33,010 --> 03:07:37,920
is phenomenal and I can't wait to see
where it goes. So thanks for coming on.

2835
03:07:38,100 --> 03:07:42,240
And uh, this is guaranteed
to not be the last time. Uh,

2836
03:07:44,180 --> 03:07:48,500
and of course to the military

2837
03:07:50,180 --> 03:07:52,790
folks overseas right now.

2838
03:07:52,850 --> 03:07:57,850
Thanks for allowing us
to make this podcast.

2839
03:07:58,190 --> 03:08:03,190
We could not make this podcast without
your service and sacrifice to the police

2840
03:08:05,780 --> 03:08:08,510
and all law enforcement to firefighters,

2841
03:08:09,020 --> 03:08:13,010
BMTs and other first responders.
Again,

2842
03:08:14,060 --> 03:08:18,620
you allow us to make this podcast
and we are thankful for it.

2843
03:08:19,880 --> 03:08:20,750
And finally,

2844
03:08:22,670 --> 03:08:27,670
and of course to the
working class of America,

2845
03:08:30,480 --> 03:08:35,480
thanks for doing what
you do day after day,

2846
03:08:35,820 --> 03:08:39,390
working, sweating, bleeding,

2847
03:08:41,310 --> 03:08:43,230
building calluses

2848
03:08:45,210 --> 03:08:48,180
while you build our great country.

2849
03:08:48,330 --> 03:08:50,610
Thank you for holding the line

2850
03:08:53,130 --> 03:08:54,750
than thank you for getting after it.

2851
03:08:57,080 --> 03:08:58,910
So until next time,

2852
03:09:00,710 --> 03:09:04,730
