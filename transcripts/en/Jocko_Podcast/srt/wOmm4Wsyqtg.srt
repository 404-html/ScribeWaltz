1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,710
In a leadership position.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,950
Is it okay to take or ask for suggestions
on solving a task or is it okay to

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:10,830
take suggestions that
stray from my initial plan?

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,180
Yes.
Yes.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,350
And I hope that this,

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,380
that would made you decide to ask this
questions cause you just like found out

7
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:32,460
about the podcast or the book
or whatever because this is,

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,840
this is something that absolutely anybody
that kind of listens will would say

9
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,770
yes, absolutely. You're
in a leadership position.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,930
You should definitely ask for suggestions,

11
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:50,830
take suggestions, share the
planning, let other people lead.

12
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,750
Many brains be smarter
than your one brain.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,040
That's what you want. You want to
utilize the brain power of your team.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,940
Now the reason you're asking
this question, little bit scary,

15
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:03,930
a little bit of a red flag.

16
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:07,000
The reason you're asking this question
because you were afraid of what it'll

17
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,620
look like. If you have to ask, hey
guys, I'm not sure how to do this,

18
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:14,760
or you're afraid of of what it
means that you're going to look,

19
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,280
that you're going to look weak,
you're going to look like a weak leader,

20
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,840
and that's definitely, yeah,
you're going an experience.

21
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,030
That's your insecurity that's making
that happened. Don't be insecure.

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,420
Don't be in secure because the open
mind and asking for suggestions and the

23
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:34,020
taking suggestions, it actually
makes you look like a better leader.

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,970
I know that sounds crazy.

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,330
It actually makes you look like a better
leader when you say, Hey, you know what?

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,170
Echo, we got this promise
off. Not a hundred percent
sure how to tackle this one.

27
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,010
Can you give me a hand?

28
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,930
Can you give me some suggestions
here that doesn't make you say, oh,

29
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:53,250
Jocko doesn't know his game. He's an
idiot. No, it goes, aw man. Jockos humble.

30
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:56,430
He's looking for input.
He wants to work together as a team.

31
00:01:58,610 --> 00:01:59,340
Okay,

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,910
so yes,
absolutely.

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,920
Ask for suggestions, take
suggestions. Have an open mind.

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,090
Disregard your plan.
If your plan wasn't good,

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,480
I'm not just going to hold fast to a plan
because I'm the one that thought of it.

36
00:02:17,481 --> 00:02:21,800
That's not good leadership at all.
Don't do that.

37
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,910
Open your mind.
Yup.
