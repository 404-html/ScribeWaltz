00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,080
This is Jocko podcast number
100 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,720
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,740
And we have a guest with us tonight who
is in large part responsible for this

4
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:18,220
podcast existing in the first place,

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,900
who has provided massive support behind
pretty much everything I've done,

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,460
including books and podcasts and events
and all this other stuff that I've been

7
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:32,461
getting after for the last couple of
years since I departed the shadows and

8
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:37,660
stepped into the normal world.
In fact,

9
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:42,640
this is the person that pulled me from
the shadows into the normal world.

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,710
Mr Tim Ferris. Tim, welcome to the show.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,380
Thank you for having me Jack
off. And we have, you know,

12
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,570
an interesting state right now

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,450
you do because you just
got done with a 10 day

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,690
silent retreat and a five day
fast embedded in there somewhere,

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,920
right? I did. So it was my first 10
day. You know what? Like you know what,

16
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:13,180
my notes weren't here after I said that.
My notes are dude question mark like,

17
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,860
dude, cause that's what that
makes me think. Just like,

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,560
dude, okay, tell us about it a little bit.

19
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,500
And I know you'll probably cover it later,
but

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,110
it was in retrospect,

21
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:27,620
probably layering a few too many
things on top of one another.

22
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,790
But it was my first meditation retreat,

23
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:36,791
also my first silent retreat combined
and consisted of 10 days of waking up at

24
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:42,770
five 30 and I support that part beginning,
I know it's sleeping in,

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,060
but starting at five 30 I hadn't woken
up with the stars in a while and then

26
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,710
sitting for 45 minutes of meditation,

27
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:56,270
walking for 45 minutes of meditation
and doing that until 9:00 PM with the

28
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:59,030
exception of meals.
But as you mentioned,

29
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,090
I fasted for the first five days out
of 10 because I wanted to see how that

30
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:07,091
affected my state and I sat
during meals effectively,

31
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:13,340
meaning meditated during those times
as well. And it was a, an intense,

32
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,270
unexpectedly intense experience because
it unlearn is your psyche in a fashion

33
00:02:20,361 --> 00:02:21,650
that I hadn't experienced before.

34
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,400
Since you have no distractions
and you're not permitted to read,

35
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,250
there's no music,
there's no talking,

36
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,680
you're discouraged from any writing.

37
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,170
There are no devices and that means
there's no real escape from whatever is

38
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:39,490
ricocheting inside your own head.
And uh,

39
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,130
as you go through the passing days,

40
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:48,160
you drop into deeper layers of your
personality and the stories that you've

41
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:53,060
constructed for yourself as well as
direct experience and memories that you

42
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:57,350
haven't thought of in my
case. 20, 25 years, 30 years,

43
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,780
35 years in some cases, very vivid,
intense memories that come back.

44
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,970
And so people have

45
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:10,590
a very difficult time at points and the
teachers are there every other day to

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
interact on a one on one basis to
ensure that people don't have a complete

47
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,250
psychotic break.
I suppose.

48
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,300
Did you hear random question,

49
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,990
but would you hear people like
crying in their rooms or whatever?

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,520
Heard people crying? Uh,
definitely hurt people crying.

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,950
People went through a lot of

52
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,510
pain and there were sublime experiences
as well in moments of deep clarity or,

53
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,620
uh,
alleviation of suffering.

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:49,650
But I think that I was actually just
looking forward to describing the

55
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,430
experience to our mutual friend,
Dr Peter Attia,

56
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,760
who may be the most like cerebral,
intense,

57
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:02,761
impatient analytical person I've
ever met to a degree that even I find

58
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,720
hilarious, which is difficult to
achieve in this world, in this world,

59
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,330
in this life.
Uh,

60
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,030
and his level of obsession
and perseverating on diff,

61
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,380
on concepts endlessly,
uh,

62
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,930
makes me want to do a second retreat with
Peter when he's not allowed to tell me

63
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:22,810
how he's feeling.

64
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,810
Because I think the more you have run
your life through your prefrontal Cortex,

65
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,280
the harder you fall. And, uh,

66
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,460
I would not recommend it for most people
because I would have left the retreat

67
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,600
three or four times,

68
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:45,601
probably were it not for one particular
teacher who had decades of experience

69
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:52,141
with tens of thousands of retreatants
because I felt like I was going to leave

70
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,430
in worse shape than I came in.

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That I had regressed to a very reactive
emotional state and that it was going to

72
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:03,910
be a huge handicap when I left.

73
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,450
I felt like I was regressing tremendously
and he was able to right the ship a

74
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,060
little bit along the way.
But if,

75
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,620
if he had not been there and I had left
even on day nine, I remember I was like,

76
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,710
people are supposed to be
in this deep state of bliss.

77
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,270
Or at least that was my perception.

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I feel like I've just been rubbed raw and
all these nerves that I've numbed from

79
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,110
difficult experiences in childhood and
so on have just been exposed at the

80
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:38,800
surface. Uh, so I think it's a, I think
it requires a high level of supervision.

81
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,560
And this may not be the,

82
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,260
the forum for discussing
what I'm about to say,

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,800
but for those people who have the
experience, it might make some sense.

84
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,980
It had the characteristics of a very,

85
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,250
a very strong psychedelic experience,

86
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,410
but laid out over 10 days
where there's no escape.

87
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,870
So instead of ripping off the Bandaid,

88
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,350
you are being exposed to
facets of your life and

89
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,910
character that perhaps you
have not faced in decades.

90
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,550
So yeah,
it was a fun 10 days.

91
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,110
We get when you do,
when you get sleep deprivation,

92
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,840
which I've gone through some
insignificant sleep deprivation, you know,

93
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:27,730
you have those kind of um,
you know,

94
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:30,090
you take a trip without leaving
the farm type situations. And,

95
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:33,940
and for me it was nothing, nothing
crazy or anything. You know,

96
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,060
I remember seeing stop
signs in the ocean and uh,

97
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:41,350
traffic lights in the ocean and
stuff like that. So not crazy crazy,

98
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:42,131
but it's not,

99
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:47,131
it wasn't some psychological sort of
unpacking where I was meeting my former

100
00:06:47,831 --> 00:06:52,410
self or anything like that. Um,
but yeah, you definitely that,

101
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,500
that's when I hear,

102
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:57,870
cause I've never tried psychedelic
drugs and when I wouldn't,

103
00:06:57,871 --> 00:07:02,040
people talk about them. To me it
does not sound fun to me because I,

104
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,080
I think that where I think that where I
would end up would not be a happy place

105
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,470
and I don't really need to
hang out there very much.

106
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,960
And I should, I should also say that I
don't, in the case of the silent retreat,

107
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:20,780
or in the case of Psychedelics,
do it for fun and in,

108
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,840
I've had a few people ask me,
did you enjoy your experience?

109
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:27,810
I had a few staffers afterwards. They're
like, oh, did you enjoy your treat?

110
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,060
And I'm like,
I found it valuable.

111
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,020
I wouldn't use the word enjoy.

112
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,240
Yeah, yeah. Well, you, you, obviously,

113
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:42,350
you're going to unpack this thing and I'm
sure you'll do awesome episode talking

114
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:45,860
about it. As you look back on
it right now, your brain is

115
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,980
still, it's still 70% there.
And they told us at the end,

116
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:54,010
which I thought was very appropriate
because it applies to so many things.

117
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:56,510
They said, uh, or one of the
teachers said, you're, you,

118
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,250
you think you're normal right now and
you're not. You've very hypersensitive.

119
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,340
You're retreat is half done.
So it'll take 10 days,

120
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:07,630
the equivalent amount of time to
reintegrate and get re tethered.

121
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,340
And I remember thinking to myself,
I have fucking book launch calming.

122
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,070
I don't have 10 days to gingerly
walk my way back to reality. But,

123
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,300
uh, nonetheless, uh, that's true
for so much, right? I mean, it's,

124
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,700
if you have a book and your book
is 90% done, I remember I told, uh,

125
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:26,980
a more seasoned writer when I was writing
my second book. I said, I'm 90% done.

126
00:08:26,981 --> 00:08:28,500
They said, oh,
congratulations. The only 50.

127
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,760
That's the trim work.
It's just like building a house.

128
00:08:33,761 --> 00:08:37,690
They stayed trim work that all that
little stuff that takes longer than you

129
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:42,400
think it's going to take. Well, so to
just set the stage a little bit, um,

130
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,010
number one,
you are on this podcast before,

131
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:48,280
which was an awesome episode
and you talked about some
of your heart experiences

132
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,850
growing up and going through college and
actually having suicidal thoughts and

133
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,310
beyond suicidal plans.

134
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,540
That was podcast number 50 and it
really helped out a lot of people.

135
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:04,800
I got an immense amount of great feedback
from people and so thank you for doing

136
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:07,980
that.
And on that podcast,

137
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:12,981
we also briefly discussed
a novel called Musashi,

138
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,890
and it's just this incredible
book that you'd read.

139
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,891
And I had read and the ending of the
book is just full on epic and it's also a

140
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,100
thousand page book and it takes
the, the whole, the, the, the,

141
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,390
the ending of the book is literally
the last page and a half. So that's it.

142
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,420
You have to read a thousand pages
to get to this thing, this ending.

143
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,590
And we decided on that podcast that we
would do, do that book for podcast 100.

144
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:42,591
So here we are and we're going to
talk about the book Musashi by Eeg,

145
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,180
a Yoshikawa Agee,
Yoshi color.

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,120
And I'm just going to accept the fact
that I will be getting my Japanese

147
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:54,480
pronunciation corrected all day long.

148
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,870
I won't correct it unless
you want me to correct. Well,

149
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,430
maybe after I'd get done with something
you could tell me it's just going to

150
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:04,490
suck.
That's all there is to it.

151
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,180
Now the book, so if you don't know
anything about it, Miyamoto Musashi,

152
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,370
great Japanese swordsman and he wrote
the book, the Book of five rings. Um,

153
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,640
and I actually covered that
book on podcast number 80.

154
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,730
So if you haven't listened to 50
and if you haven't listened to 80,

155
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,240
go listen to those too.
And it'll give you some background,

156
00:10:27,241 --> 00:10:29,370
which I don't want to spend a bunch of
time on there cause he's spent a bunch of

157
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:31,110
time on it on that podcast.

158
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,440
But here's the basic
understanding of whom we saw.

159
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:39,441
She was born into a Samurai family around
1584 fought his first dual at the age

160
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:45,510
of 13 against a grown man who he killed
by throwing him to the ground and

161
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:50,140
beating him with a Bokken, Boykin, Boykin,
Boykin. Oh, this is going to get them.

162
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,410
But I wouldn't sort of see, I
should've just said wooden sword.

163
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,850
And we would have been good in
that, in, and then through his life,

164
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,970
he traveled and he did all kinds of
things and he fought 60 sword duels.

165
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,990
I used to think that they were all to the
death, but they actually weren't right.

166
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,030
There's some of them were just like,
if you could submit you, you know,

167
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,790
the opponent could just say, Yup, you one,

168
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,870
and you could agree you beforehand what
the rules of engagement would be. Oh,

169
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,590
okay. So they could have a discussion and
determine the extent to which you could

170
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:26,670
inflict damage on the other person.
So they weren't all to the death.

171
00:11:26,671 --> 00:11:29,520
They could have a, basically
a gentleman's agreement, like,

172
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,130
let's not kill each other today.
It's only do this one,

173
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:35,280
two broken bones and handicapping.

174
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,430
How do you gotta do you gotta
that's a hardcore conversation.

175
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,180
Yeah. But how do you, how do you
come off not looking like the wolf?

176
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,910
You don't want to be the first one to
say, hey, let's just break it down.

177
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,680
Let's just break bones. You know,
you should just be like, no,

178
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:54,190
we'll go to the death. That's it.
That's weird. Uh, but yeah, so,

179
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,450
but a bunch of them war to the death,

180
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,010
a lot of them were to the death and again,
um,

181
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,500
that then he got done with that,

182
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,750
all that fighting and he
wrote the book of five rings.

183
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:09,751
He also wrote a book or up
like steps called Dual Dakota.

184
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,830
Close Japanese has this,

185
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,020
this stuttered content.
And for people who were wondering,

186
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:20,021
why am I the Japanese conciliary
it's because I lived in Japan.

187
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,650
It's my first trip overseas ever,
uh,

188
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,000
from 15 to 16 as an exchange
student where I was the only knot.

189
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,570
I was the only American
in a a 5,000 person,

190
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:37,010
Japanese high school where I also wore
a uniform and did judo and lived with a

191
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:38,540
Japanese family for an entire year.

192
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:42,720
So that is why I'm commenting
on Japanese dope. Godel dope go.

193
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,660
[inaudible] is a alone coal is to walk,
let's say Dole is wage.

194
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,830
It's the same goal from judo
or [inaudible], which is way,

195
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,540
so it's the way of walking alone.

196
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,640
Yeah.
And I should have said that.

197
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,460
That's the reason why I thought it would
be awesome to have you on here because

198
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,670
you do have this knowledge not only
of the language, but of the culture.

199
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:05,840
And you did this, you've done a
bunch of weird stone. Cool. Yeah.

200
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,300
Y'All was [inaudible]
Japanese horseback archery,

201
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,910
which by the way also pretty dangerous.
Turns out. Yeah. And so that's what,

202
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,380
that's why I wanted to have you on here
because you've got massive amount of

203
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,530
knowledge that I don't have.
So again in that,

204
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:25,850
that Duco close enough. We're
going with it. Let's roll with it.

205
00:13:25,851 --> 00:13:28,250
This is covered in podcast 80 as well.

206
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,640
And also this is a spoiler alert and I
guess I should do this every time I do a

207
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:37,760
book cause I do books on here a lot and
I always tell what's going to happen.

208
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,570
But for this one,
this is a spoiler alert because the book,

209
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
it does have the most epic ending.
I think it most be,

210
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,910
it might be the most
epic ending of any book.

211
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,780
I honestly think that it might be
that and we are going to cover it.

212
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:56,090
So if you want to read this book then
and we gave you about a year to read it,

213
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:57,020
but if you haven't read it yet,

214
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,390
maybe you're not going to read
it and you should just listen.

215
00:13:59,391 --> 00:14:02,150
But if you do want to read the book
and get the full satisfaction of it,

216
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,340
then stop right now and then go read
Musashi. Take another year to read it,

217
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,690
which is a thousand pages long,

218
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,970
and then come back and listen to us.
So can I say one thing?

219
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,340
Absolutely.
This book

220
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,470
and way we can get back into some of
the history, but I bought this book.

221
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:25,530
I have a paperback version decades ago
in Tokyo at a bookstore called Kinokuniya

222
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,580
in Shinjuku. It's a huge bookstore.
It's, I want to say at least four floors,

223
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,420
maybe six or seven.

224
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,190
And I carried it around giving myself
scoliosis for years and years because I

225
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,490
was so intimidated by this thing.
It's, it's a few inches thick.

226
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,870
The paper is like onion skin. And
I was like, Oh God, I just can't.

227
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,340
Every time I pick it up, it's, Oh God,
I can't get into this. Once I started,

228
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,560
I could not put it down and I finished
it in a couple of days. I mean, it's,

229
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,160
it's that

230
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,850
good. So it's don't be
intimidated by this by the size.

231
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,500
It's not, it's not as much of a, a
slog as you would expect once you,

232
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,130
once you get into it, you just
get sucked in. And the reading.

233
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,400
The writing is beautiful. It's
very clean, very clean writing.

234
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,920
And the story is, that's another
thing I should say too, is that,

235
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:15,890
so there's a bunch of intertwining
narratives in there about a bunch of

236
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:17,780
different people and
characters and the AA.

237
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:21,710
They all are interesting and impactful
and they all add to the story.

238
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,450
Obviously for a couple hour podcasts.
We can't get into all of those. And,

239
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,810
and really we'll be hitting like this,

240
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:34,730
this the main plot line I guess. But
there's all these other things that are,

241
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,150
that are going on that we're just
don't have time to touch on that are,

242
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,820
that are really great to read about.
And there's so many,

243
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,220
if this guy would have been
a screenwriter, oh my God.
Yeah. The dialogue alone.

244
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,020
The book worth it. Yeah. It's,
it's just a great book and

245
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,830
that's that.
Um,

246
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,160
I guess we might as well get into
it a little bit. And when we did,

247
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,380
when I did podcast 80
with a book of five rings,

248
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,610
I started with the beginning of this
book and I said, when I did that,

249
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:12,260
that when we do this book,
I'm reading it again cause it's so legit.

250
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:18,020
Uh, so he Rigo Taqa Zone.
Alright, Tuck Hazel,

251
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,370
Hazel [inaudible] lay among the corpses.

252
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,380
There were thousands of them.
The whole world's gone crazy.

253
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,410
He thought dimly a man might as well
be a dead leaf floating in the autumn

254
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:37,730
breeze. He himself looked like one of
the lifeless bodies surrounding him.

255
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,750
He tried to raise his head, but could
only lift it a few inches from the ground.

256
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,240
He couldn't remember ever feeling so weak.
How long have I been here?

257
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,350
He wondered,
flies came buzzing around his head.

258
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,060
He wanted to brush them away,

259
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,860
but couldn't even muster the energy
to raise his arm. It was stiff,

260
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,690
almost brittle like the rest of his body.
I must have been out for quite a while.

261
00:17:02,691 --> 00:17:06,170
He thought wiggling one finger at a time.

262
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:12,080
Little did he know he was wounded with
two bullets, lodged firmly in his thigh.

263
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,900
Low dark clouds shifted ominously
across the sky the night before,

264
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,000
sometime between midnight and dawn,

265
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,110
a blinding raid had drenched
the plane of Second Shahara.

266
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:30,400
It was now past noon on the 15th of the
ninth month of 1600 though the typhoon

267
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:35,810
had passed now and then fresh torrents
of rain would fall on the corpses on the

268
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,340
tick. Asos up turned
face. Each time it came,

269
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,390
he opened and closed his mouth like a
fish trying to drink in the droplets.

270
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,070
It's like the water they wipe a
dying man's lips with he savoring

271
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,180
each bit of moisture cause head was numb.
His thoughts,

272
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:59,020
the fleeting shadows of delirium,
his side had lost.

273
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,480
He knew that much.
How do Yaki?

274
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Supposedly an ally had been secretly in
league with the eastern army and when it

275
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,330
turned on Mitsunari
his troops at twilight,

276
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,950
the tide of the battle turn to

277
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,570
okay,

278
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,570
he then attack the armies
of the other commanders.

279
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,720
You Kita Shimazu Konishi and the collapse
of the Western army was complete and

280
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:27,030
only half a days fighting.

281
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:30,420
The question of who would henceforth
rule the country was settled.

282
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,730
It was Tokugawa Ieyasu the powerful,

283
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,880
he dies demo images of his sister and the
old villagers floated before his eyes.

284
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,540
I'm dying.
He thought without a tinge of sadness,

285
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:54,180
is this what it's really like?
He felt drawn to the piece of death,

286
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,020
like a child mesmerized by a flame.

287
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,890
So that's how the book kind of kicks off.
And

288
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,700
this guy was just born on the battlefield
basically and is fighting in these

289
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,760
savage battles as, as, as a kid,

290
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,150
as a kid. Um, and I,

291
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:23,430
I think it's interesting that you start
the book where a guy's about to die,

292
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,660
you know,
and I think that's,

293
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,260
there's something significant to that
and it's not the only time in the book

294
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,130
where he's about to die. He,
he faces these bad situations

295
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,180
over and over again.
And

296
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,710
again, we just have to fast forward
through massive chunks of this book.

297
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,160
And I was just going to make one comment.
Absolutely.

298
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,380
There's people who are wondering
why we're saying Tuck Zol.

299
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,330
So talk is all is,

300
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,590
is represented by the same two characters
that can also be read as Musashi.

301
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,140
So there are different
readings for characters and
Japanese depending on if they

302
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:06,560
are adapted Chinese readings
or native Japanese readings.

303
00:20:06,561 --> 00:20:10,160
So Musashi is the,
what would be called the,

304
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,730
the [inaudible] or the Japanese
reading and talk is all same.

305
00:20:13,731 --> 00:20:17,180
Two characters would be the
Chinese reading basically,

306
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,460
I mean the Chinese origin reading,
which is called on Naomi.

307
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,700
So it's the same person talk,
Gisele and then Musashi,

308
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,450
the Japanese and Chinese
characters related linguistically,

309
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,470
they are very, very similar. So the uh,

310
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,650
the Japanese took Chinese characters,

311
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,680
which they call congee and they converted
them into to what are referred to as

312
00:20:41,271 --> 00:20:44,900
silver berries. So we have an alphabet,
a, B, c, d. We have vowels and consonants.

313
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,890
In Japanese,
they have what are called silver.

314
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,890
Barry's meaning they are syllables instead
of individual letters to have cocky,

315
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,570
Kooky, cool mommy, mommy
mill saw sheet. The so,

316
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,060
and uh,

317
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,610
which is part of the reason why Japanese
have so much trouble with almost every

318
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:04,450
language. They kinda got robbed
when like the gods were handing out.

319
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,280
Sounds so they have trouble with a
lot of languages, including English.

320
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:12,640
But nonetheless, uh, the, uh,

321
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:17,641
those were simplified
versions of the characters.

322
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:20,370
So for instance, the character for, uh,

323
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,270
that you could say represents peace in
shine is which is an, so if for instance,

324
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:29,190
like, uh, east, the word in
Chinese would be untrendy.

325
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,780
So I've spent time in China as well.
In Japanese, it's unzipped, it's,

326
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,760
it's very similar.
And then the character for [inaudible] is,

327
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,260
has a roof and then a woman under a roof.
And that represents peace.

328
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,420
That was then modified into
the sound op, the vowel. Ah,

329
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,840
and uh,
there are fewer strokes in that.

330
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,310
So that's some of the framework
for the Japanese writing systems.

331
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:58,870
If two syllable trees and then the
Chinese characters that they use,

332
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,970
the languages are not mutually
intelligible though, are they? Not at all.

333
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
Now there are certain words that are

334
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,550
not terribly close,

335
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:17,260
but maybe what you would find say
between Portuguese and Spanish and drive,

336
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:21,970
for instance. So you would
have a word, like a telephone,

337
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,320
which is literally a electric
talk, which is, you know,

338
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,810
and even electricity as cloud. And a
dragon underneath. It was kind of cool.

339
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,460
But anyway,
the,

340
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,490
that's they wa in Japanese Dm Guac and
Mandarin and then Joan Quad Korean,

341
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,800
because a lot of the words in Korea,

342
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:45,490
we're also borrowed from the Chinese
characters. Uh, but beyond that,

343
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,600
the grammar, everything else is
completely, completely different.

344
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,010
And W I think are actually
in here cover where he gets,

345
00:22:54,011 --> 00:22:56,770
where he comes up with a new name or when
he decides to take the new name. Yeah.

346
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:58,540
So the guy that I'm talking
about in the beginning,

347
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:01,930
as Tim just pointed out
that his Musashi Tuck,

348
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:06,040
Hazel Hazel, it's a tough one.
The zone, the zone is a long,

349
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,960
so tuck, Tuck, Azule Taco zone
there. We got his Musashi. Exactly.

350
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,590
And you'll find that out shortly for
those people who are watching the video.

351
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:19,300
That is talk,
Gisele and Musashi,

352
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,860
those two characters. Okay.
Anyway, what, so what does that,

353
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:26,050
what does the rest of that thing and
say it's a bookmark. What does this,

354
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:31,051
this is the wrapping that was put around
the cover of this book in the English

355
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:35,050
section in Kinokuniya bookstores so
that people could figure out what the

356
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:38,620
content was without, without having
to read the back jacket in English.

357
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,200
So this is, you know, Musashi, Loomio,
orthotic coke, honeymoon, got glue,

358
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,093
so on and so,

359
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:50,260
and then Miyamoto Musashi and
then Yoshikawa age is all here.

360
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,890
And then a little description on the back

361
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,320
are there just copies of this everyday.
Everyone read this in Japan.

362
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,690
This,
I mean

363
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,020
he misremembering this,

364
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:07,050
but I remember at the time looking
at this book and reading about the,

365
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,540
as they would call it, on the back
cover of the best selling Samurai epic.

366
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:18,930
And somewhere reading this
book has sold something absurd,

367
00:24:19,481 --> 00:24:23,920
like 20 million plus copies in a
country of a, whatever it might be,

368
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,270
150 million people.

369
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,250
That seems now that I've been
through the book process a few times,

370
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,900
like it cannot be true,
but it is a very, very,

371
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:39,140
very famous book in Japan. And
everybody's going to know who, uh,

372
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,970
they would say Miyamoto Musashi.
They would give the last name first.

373
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,890
Everyone is going to know who this guy
is and they have hundreds of comic books

374
00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:50,170
and so on.
Historical comic books,

375
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:53,650
fictional comic books that
have been written about

376
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,730
Misashi.
Yeah.

377
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,420
And this thing originally came
out in a series, I think in, um,

378
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,330
1939 or 1933 or 1935
or something like that.

379
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,410
And it originally came out as a series,
I think in like a magazine or something.

380
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:14,780
You're going to get it right. Quite
possibly could be the case. I don't know.

381
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,500
I'm pretty sure.
So we'll go with it.

382
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,060
All right. Now we are going to
get to a point where, again,

383
00:25:26,061 --> 00:25:29,400
we're fast forwarding it
and at this point, Musashi,

384
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:34,410
she's been accused of murder and he's
been hung from a tree and Tequan Tequan

385
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,600
yeah.
Pakwan yes.

386
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,960
Talk one is sort of this kind of traveling
priests on any sort of counseling and

387
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,350
advising and yeah,

388
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,280
just sort of counseling and
advising Musashi that at this point,

389
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,300
and he's kind of wandering around as
Musashi has now been accused of murder and

390
00:25:58,911 --> 00:26:03,020
hung up up in this tree where they're
gonna eventually kill him. And here we,

391
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,120
here we go, go into the book, Talk One,

392
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:11,360
save me techie.
Zos Cry for help was loud and plaintive.

393
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:17,330
The branch was beginning to tremble as
though it as though the whole tree were

394
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:22,190
weeping. I want to be a better
man. I realize how important it is,

395
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,550
what a privilege it is to be born human.

396
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,500
I'm almost dead,

397
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,560
but I understand what it means to be
alive and now that I know my whole life

398
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:37,760
will consist of being tied to this tree.
I can't undo what I've done.

399
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,070
You're finally coming to your census
for the first time in your life.

400
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:43,980
You're talking like a

401
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,640
human being. I don't want
to die. Taka Zilla cried.

402
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,000
I want to live. I want
to go out. Try again.

403
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,130
Do everything right this time his
body convulsed with is sobbing on.

404
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,020
Please help me. Help me.
The monk shook his head.

405
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,400
Sorry, Taco zone. It is out of my hands.

406
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,260
It is the law of nature.
You can't do things over again.

407
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,000
That's life.

408
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:16,350
Everything in it is for keeps everything.

409
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,490
You can't put your head back on
after the enemy's cut it off.

410
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,030
That's the way it is. Of
course, I feel sorry for you,

411
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,230
but I can't undo that rope
because it wasn't me who tied it.

412
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,570
It was you.
All I can do is give you some advice,

413
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:39,110
faced death bravely and quietly say a
prayer and hope some someone bothers to

414
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:42,660
listen and for the sake of your ancestors,

415
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:47,610
tech azo have the decency to die
with a peaceful look on your face.

416
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,740
The clatter of Taco Juan's
sandals faded into the distance.

417
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,440
He was gone and talk as
though cried no more.

418
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,800
Following the spirit of the monks advice,

419
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,630
he shut the eyes that had just
experienced a great awakening and forgot

420
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:08,631
everything you forgot about living and
dying and under the myriad of tiny stars

421
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,440
lay perfectly still as the night
breeze side through the tree.

422
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,340
He was cold,
very cold.

423
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,180
I mean obviously wrote a book called
extreme ownership where you're responsible

424
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:26,670
for your actions and you need to take
responsibility for things in your lives.

425
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:31,020
But this thing where he says, I can't
untie the rope because it wasn't me.

426
00:28:31,021 --> 00:28:32,790
That was that tied it.
It was you.

427
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,590
You put yourself in this position and
that's, that's the way it is. You want,

428
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:42,120
your head is cut off.
You can't put it back on Musashi or Tuck.

429
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,780
Azul gets, he does crazy
stuff too, right? He's,

430
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,370
he's young and he does crazy things.

431
00:28:47,371 --> 00:28:50,760
And one of the crazy things he does is
his sister's in some kind of jail or

432
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:54,690
something and he just like a
tax it and any loses and he,

433
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,360
they gets arrested and he gets
put in prison for three years.

434
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,410
And at this point he's getting released
from jail after he's been in jail for

435
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:06,000
three years. And again, obviously I'm the,

436
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,220
I just skipped three years
of this guy's jail time,

437
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,020
which actually is pretty
short in the book.

438
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:14,400
They don't spend a lot of time in jail.
Uh, but he's been in jail for three years.

439
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,510
He gets out and here we,
he's,

440
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:22,470
he's having a conversation and here we go.

441
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,380
[inaudible] smiled silently.

442
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,310
I want to wander about on my own for
awhile and then talk. Juan who's back,

443
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,840
that's where he's having the
conversation with. Sorry.

444
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,530
He says you should change your
first name to Tacoma interjected.

445
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,790
Why not read the Chinese characters of
your name as Musashi instead of Taco?

446
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,310
You can keep writing your
name the same as before.

447
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,230
It's only fitting that everything should
begin anew on this day of your rebirth.

448
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,510
Miyamoto Musashi. It's a good name, a
very good name. We should drink to it.

449
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,550
The following day, they both left
the castle. Musashi was talking,

450
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,000
Musashi was taking his
first steps into a new life,

451
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,330
a life of discipline and training in
the martial arts during his three year

452
00:30:06,341 --> 00:30:10,600
incarceration,
he had resolved to master the art of war.

453
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:12,800
Okay.

454
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,270
Explain the, the first, the first,
last name thing. [inaudible] motors.

455
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:19,220
That that's a place, right? Or
is it, is it a, in this case,

456
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:24,050
in many cases it refers
to originally a place.

457
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,080
So my understanding is that Miyamoto
refers to whether it's a town or a village

458
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:35,540
or pro, not province, he would be
smaller where his family originated from.

459
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,020
It's not always the case,
but even if you look at English names,

460
00:30:39,021 --> 00:30:40,040
you find the same thing,
right?

461
00:30:40,041 --> 00:30:43,310
So it could have been an English
end in a lot of languages.

462
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:46,280
It often relates to an early vocation.

463
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:51,290
So Ferris for instance, comes
from Ferris, like f e r r o,

464
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:55,280
u. S like Ferris oxide iron.
Because way back in the day,

465
00:30:55,281 --> 00:31:00,281
at some point my family worked with metals
and that's where the name comes from.

466
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,280
Uh, is Miyamoto the first name or the
last name? [inaudible] is the last name.

467
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:12,230
So similarly, the authors of this, the
author of this book, Agee Yoshikawa,

468
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:13,880
the Yoshikawa is the last name.

469
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:15,720
Yeah.

470
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,890
And why do I say Miyamoto Musashi.

471
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,400
Okay.

472
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,780
The Japanese always say
the last name first. Okay.

473
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,680
They say the family name first, except
for in this guy's case, eg what the,

474
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:32,780
so this is [inaudible] got it.
Yeah,

475
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,850
that makes sense. Yup. Making some
progress. So for instance, in jail,

476
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,570
very slow progress.

477
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,680
Intellectual Capability maxing out.
Yes.

478
00:31:45,681 --> 00:31:49,100
In, in, in Japan for
instance, even as a young kid,

479
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:52,640
when you're talking to your friends,
you,

480
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,310
you would never, I can't recall even
once saying someone's first name,

481
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:02,720
you would just say, uh, boy, you know,

482
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,110
Yamamoto Polaka like you would,
so I'll call you Ferris. Yeah.

483
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,640
You called me with my case because
Ferris was psyche. Not Confusing,

484
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,040
but they knew I was American and
Tim like Teemu as they would say,

485
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,070
uh, we shorter. So they just called
me teemu. Yeah. Tim was on the team.

486
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,230
Can you get that in the military too,

487
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:24,310
where everyone kind of gets introduced
by your last name and everyone for a

488
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,310
while. Everyone just kind of calls each
other, you know, Willink, Ferris, Charles,

489
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:31,910
you know. Right. So, but that's how they
address each other pre, normally. Oh yeah,

490
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,290
the all the time.
Yeah.

491
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,440
With the exception of saying
my host family where I'm
dealing with everybody who

492
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,940
has the same last name, you
can get very, so then I'll

493
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:43,880
call them by their first names.
Check, check. All right, now

494
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,580
this book does have a
romantic interest in it.

495
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:52,290
I hate to inform everyone
and it's so it's,

496
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,500
it's absolutely worth coming
covering because it's the,

497
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,680
the way it gets handled
throughout is just freaking epic.

498
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:06,140
So his romantic interest is a woman named

499
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,770
Oh yes. See, um, Osu and he's,

500
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,110
again,
we can't cover the whole story,

501
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:20,140
but this is his romantic
interest and we will ease he's,

502
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:21,950
she's in and out of the story.

503
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,390
And the main point is that even though
he's desires her and wants to be with her

504
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:27,260
at the same time,

505
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,220
there's something that's more important
to him and that is the way of the sword.

506
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:36,740
So here we go. Back to the book,
Musashi covered her small white hand,

507
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:40,670
which was resting on the railing
with his own. Listen, he said,

508
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,260
plaintively I beg of you. Just stop
and think. What's there to think about?

509
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,960
I told you I've just become a new man.

510
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:53,030
I stayed in that musty hole for
three years. I read books, I fought.

511
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,870
I screamed and cried.
Then suddenly the light dawned.

512
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,190
I understood what it means to be human.
I have a new name,

513
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,960
Miyamoto Musashi. I want to dedicate
myself to training and discipline.

514
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:10,430
I want to spend every moment of
every day working to improve myself.

515
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,730
I now know how far I have to go.

516
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,740
If you choose to bind your life to mind,
you'll never be happy.

517
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,540
There will be nothing but hardship and it
won't get any easier. As it goes along,

518
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,730
it'll get more and more difficult.

519
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,150
When you talk like that,
I feel closer to you than ever.

520
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,110
Now I'm convinced I was right.
I've found the best man I could ever find.

521
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,120
Even if I searched for
the rest of my life.

522
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:44,150
He saw he was just making things worse.
I'm sorry. I just can't take you with me.

523
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,910
Well then I'll just follow along.

524
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,270
As long as I don't interfere with
your training, what harm would it do?

525
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,740
You won't even know I'm around.
Musashi could find no answer.

526
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,580
I won't bother you.
I promise he remained silent.

527
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,000
It's all right then,
isn't it? Just wait here.

528
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:05,120
I'll be back in a second and I'll be
furious if you try and sneak away.

529
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,480
Oh two ran off towards
the basket weaving shop.

530
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:13,460
Musashi thought of ignoring everything
and running too in the opposite direction

531
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,330
though the will was there.
His feet couldn't move.

532
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:22,460
Otu looked back and called remember,
don't try to sneak off. She smiled,

533
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:25,610
showing her dimples and
Musashi inadvertently nodded.

534
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:29,930
Satisfied by this gesture.
She disappeared into the shop

535
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,050
if he was going to escape.
This was the time his heart told him so,

536
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:40,710
but his body was still shackled by Otsuka.
Pretty dimples and pleading eyes.

537
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,180
How sweet she was.

538
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,510
Okay.

539
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:47,450
It was certain no one in the world
would save his sister or safe.

540
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:51,820
His sister loved him so much and it
wasn't as though he disliked her.

541
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:56,200
He looked at the sky.
He looked into the water,

542
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,130
desperately gripped the railing,
troubled and confused.

543
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,210
Soon tiny bits of wood began floating
from the bridge into the flowing stream.

544
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:07,800
Okay.

545
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,460
Oh, to reappeared on the
bridge in new straw, sandals,

546
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:16,580
light yellow leggings and a large
traveling hat tied under the Chin with the

547
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,050
Crimson Ribbon.
She'd never looked more beautiful,

548
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,760
but Musashi was nowhere to be seen.

549
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,250
Okay.

550
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,860
With a cry of shock,
she burst into tears.

551
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:31,540
Then her eyes fell upon the spot on the
railing from which the chips of wood had

552
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:33,820
fallen there.

553
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,560
Carved with a point of a dagger was
the clearly inscribed a message.

554
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,650
Forgive me,
forgive me.

555
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,980
I love how it measured.
His emotions are in the pros.

556
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:55,890
He clearly did not dislike her.
Yeah, that's heavy. That's like,

557
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:01,230
that's like, I love you. And
is it the speech? It is. It is.

558
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,670
But yeah, that is the, that is the
nightmare scenario for women right there.

559
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,800
That is it. That's an abandonment issue
is number one. And having spent, um,

560
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:14,800
you know, quite some time in the, in
the seal teams, you know, this, this,

561
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,350
this is a real thing. You know, guys,

562
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,430
they have to choose between
this girl and their job.

563
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,760
And of course some guys can
make it work and blah blah blah.

564
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:26,730
And I did a pretty decent job of making
it work. But I'm telling you, it's a hard,

565
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,390
there's a 90% divorce rate in the
seal teams in the military tie.

566
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,870
So this is a real choice that guys had
to make and it's, it can be really hard.

567
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,130
And that's just a nightmare scenario.
And,

568
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:39,780
and honestly what's jacked up is that
the guys are actually trying to do the

569
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:43,110
right thing. They're actually trying,
they're, they're looking at a girl saying,

570
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:47,280
look, you don't want to sign up for
this. Like this is not going to be fun.

571
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,080
And you know,

572
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:52,770
of course people fall
in love and they goes,

573
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:57,360
emotions start to take over ridiculously.
And,

574
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,390
and you know,
it's one of those things,

575
00:38:00,391 --> 00:38:04,020
but that's a nightmare
scenario for a girl. Yeah.

576
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,170
And for a guy, I think this is the
weird thing, I can't speak guy girl.

577
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:13,740
I can't speak for girls cause I'm not one.
But for most guys,

578
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,680
they read that and they kind
of go, yeah, at least I do

579
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,400
get it. I mean, I'm, I'm echoes a softy.
He does. I've, I've been drinking the,

580
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,310
the Japan and Samurai Koolaid for so
long that I'm just like, oh, I get it.

581
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,860
Yeah. I bet. If we had, you know,

582
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:35,730
those little alum like meters
where people can vote. Yeah. Or,

583
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,980
or like this spike on the presidential
debates where things would be like,

584
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:42,430
people really agree with this thing.
If you had that right there,

585
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,290
and males between the ages of 18 and
35 we're hearing that. They're like,

586
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,350
yeah, yeah. Walkaway, dude.
That's what they're thinking.

587
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,660
Wouldn't surprise me.
Yeah. For the seal teams,

588
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:59,440
that's totally normal culture. Oh
yeah, Bro. You got to choose the teams.

589
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,830
You gotta choose the teams first, you
know? Oh, you didn't, you don't want to,

590
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,940
you know, don't want to put her through
this. So that's kind of messed up.

591
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,040
But it's the reality. Sorry.
Well, especially imagine if your,

592
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,150
your intention is to go dual
people to the death repeatedly.

593
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,750
I mean, the odds are not in
your favor. You eventually,

594
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,090
someone's going to be better than you.
What was that?

595
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,200
Do you have that section mark,

596
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:27,400
that you were reading about how he felt
about people that had gotten the upper

597
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:31,750
hand on him because that was
pretty epic. Ah, let me find it so,

598
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:36,580
and that way people don't have to listen
to 'em bad Japanese premise. Let's see.

599
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,220
Let's see. All right, here we go.

600
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,900
The adversaries he hit, I'm not going
to do as good a job of reading is Jocko.

601
00:39:47,901 --> 00:39:52,430
He's bad. He's well-practiced. Plus he has
the audio book, Voice of Jocko Willink.

602
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:55,970
The adversaries he had defeated,

603
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,840
even the ones he had killed her half
killed always disappeared from his mind,

604
00:39:59,841 --> 00:40:01,160
like so much froth,

605
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,510
but he couldn't forget anyone who got
the better of him in any way or for that

606
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:10,310
matter. Anyone in whom he sensed an
overpowering presence. That was the line.

607
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:13,940
I underline it. Anyone in whom he
sensed an overpowering presence.

608
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:17,240
Men like that dwelt in his
mind like living spirits,

609
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:21,290
and he thought constantly of how one
day he might be able to overshadow them.

610
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,220
Yeah, that's, that's deep right there.
Drive. And that's also ego issues clearly.

611
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,000
Oh yeah.

612
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,260
Those are people are hard to deal with
and when and unless you recognize that

613
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:35,530
it's your own ego that's causing these
problems cause a lot of people are so

614
00:40:35,531 --> 00:40:38,890
intimidated by,
I've seen that many times where you know,

615
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:43,200
you get like a young seal that's a real
bad ass and he's coming up and they're

616
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,050
some of the, some of the senior seals
maybe that are also bad ass. You know,

617
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,770
basically you get two alpha males
in a room and it can be problematic.

618
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:54,010
And unless one of them real,
as the old guy realizes,

619
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,680
usually it's the old guy that realizes,
hey this is a young buck coming up.

620
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:01,540
What I should do is try and
help him instead of try and
keep them down cause I'm

621
00:41:01,541 --> 00:41:06,250
jealous. And that's what Musashi's
has that attitude of, you know,

622
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:11,230
he does, he didn't care about the people
that are, that he beats. Yeah. Yeah.

623
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:13,830
He's like the Steve Jobs of Samurai.
Yeah.

624
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,110
Actually I was thinking
about this on your podcast.

625
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:23,890
It would be awesome if
you did. Like, if you,

626
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:25,870
if you did like the job's book and you,

627
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,270
you read parts of it and you've
thought about it, I thought,

628
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:31,570
I think that'd be pretty cool.
Yeah. You know, I've, I've, I've,

629
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,100
I've considered it because I've,
I've listened to

630
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,230
a lot of your episodes,
uh,

631
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,400
as you're going through books
and I have all my highlights.

632
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,010
Furthermore,
and you saw this earlier,

633
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:47,600
I showed you my index that I
created for your book field manual.

634
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,980
And I also have,

635
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:52,610
I noticed this is what I was looking at
is you're reading my own index at the

636
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:56,600
beginning of Musashi with the page numbers
and things that I found interesting.

637
00:41:56,601 --> 00:42:00,980
So I have everything locked and loaded
and ready to go for all of these books

638
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:04,490
that I've read. I think it'd be awesome,
especially because like, for instance,

639
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:05,120
you know,

640
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,270
I do books about war primarily because
that's what I can relate to them the most.

641
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:11,990
But you know, if you were reading business
books and, and you were talking about,

642
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,170
you know,
what these people went through and,

643
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,300
and then you could relate it to what
you did and how, you know, it's just,

644
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:21,260
I think it'd be, I liked, I liked the idea
of biographies. I, because I recently,

645
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,670
not to digress too far,

646
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:27,530
but I interviewed Walter Isaacson who I
know actually who wrote the job's book

647
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,430
and because he just finished a new
book on Da Vinci, which is spectacular.

648
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,750
And Yeah, I actually noticed that book,
um, because it was out selling my book,

649
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:40,430
whatever. Walter, well
good for you all to,

650
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:42,320
we're going to go off the
rails for a second, but,

651
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,790
so every year or every time
I have a book come out,

652
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,570
there's unit Garton who writes cookbooks,
barefoot Contessa,

653
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:53,570
who for whatever reason always
comes out in the same week.

654
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,700
And then he's just like lining the wall.

655
00:42:55,701 --> 00:42:58,010
She has her own walls from the bookstore.
So I'm like,

656
00:42:58,011 --> 00:42:59,660
how am I going to compete against walls?

657
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,520
I'm trying to get an end
cap and then also on Amazon,

658
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,320
every time I have a book come out,

659
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,860
literally every time I took a screenshot
of it a couple of weeks ago and I said,

660
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:14,030
man,
this book is so hardcore,

661
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:18,230
it's so undefeatable giraffes
can't dance to children's book.

662
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,010
And it's, it's uh, it is,

663
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,280
it is always just slaying
my books on Amazon.

664
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,450
Fortunately not the same category for
the best seller lists, but uh, yes,

665
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,280
biographies and uh,

666
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:36,340
and going through those to tie in pieces
would also be fun because I could,

667
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,000
I could compare my mindset in state.

668
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,523
Uh,

669
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,090
my development at the time that I made
the highlights with my observations now

670
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,490
100%. And I think again,
I think that would be,

671
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,170
I think a lot of people would get a lot
out of it because you got something out

672
00:43:54,171 --> 00:43:56,870
of it and then you get to look back on it.
You get three perspectives,

673
00:43:56,871 --> 00:43:58,670
you get the person's
respected perspective,

674
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:01,340
you get your old perspective and
you get your current perspective.

675
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,700
That's pretty legit. Yeah, that's a lot
of growth and knowledge coming from,

676
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:06,200
you know,
pretty quick statement.

677
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:11,350
So I just want to read one more since
it's right across from what I just read,

678
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,540
the anyone in whom he sensed
an overpowering presence.

679
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,110
And I don't have the full context here
because I'm just looking at independent

680
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,160
highlights,
but

681
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:25,830
it appears that Misashi has
been approached by several
men in some environment

682
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:30,920
and they're asking him questions,
a small talk,

683
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,130
Musashi wondered why

684
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,060
they were taking up their time and his,
with their small talk,

685
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,150
it became apparent that he would
not find out unless he asked.

686
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:41,730
So the next time there was a break
in the conversation, he said,

687
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,300
presumably you came because
you have some business with me.

688
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,030
These lines of dialogue is awesome.

689
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:55,080
They feigned surprise at the very idea,

690
00:44:55,081 --> 00:44:58,770
but soon admitted that they had come on
what they regarded as a very important

691
00:44:58,771 --> 00:45:03,570
mission. And it goes on and on.
There's so many good lines in there.

692
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:05,940
So many good lines. Here's
a good, here's a good part.

693
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:10,130
Moving along in the story here. He
has throughout this thing. It's,

694
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,210
uh,
when,

695
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:15,960
when I was a kid and you remember you'd
watch what was the Saturday morning or

696
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,090
one day they'd have Kung Fu theater,

697
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,630
I think it was actually called Kung
Fu theater and on Kung Fu theater,

698
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:25,710
it was always these, you
know, my school against your
school and, and, and you know,

699
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:29,070
he got all that. That seems
neat, but that's real. Like
that stuff really happened.

700
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,400
And he had these feuds with
various schools of martial arts,

701
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,360
like you'd seen Kung Fu theater.

702
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:42,050
And in this particular one he had gone
and kind of whooped up on this one school

703
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,660
and then,
but like the leader wasn't there.

704
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,380
And so he writes a letter and here's
the letter that Musashi rights,

705
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,913
which is to

706
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,280
Yoshioka Yoshioka beautiful
name,

707
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,990
Yoshi, that isn't Yoshi, call it
character. What does Yoshi mean,

708
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,940
Yoshi? I'd have to look at it
saying, I, I, I don't recall off him,

709
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:13,020
but Yoshida Yoshida, this Yoshi that
Yoshi, no ya all that same Yoshi,

710
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,070
and this is Yoshioka. So here's what
Musashi writes the letter. He says,

711
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,450
I am told that you and your disciples
are searching for me. As it happens.

712
00:46:21,451 --> 00:46:25,470
I am on the,
I'm now on the Yamato High Road.

713
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:29,400
My intention being to travel around in
general area of Egan [inaudible] for

714
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:31,970
about a year to continue
my study of sorts and ship.

715
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:34,590
I did not wish to change
my plans at this time,

716
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,400
but since I regret as much as you do
that I was unable to meet you during my

717
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:39,960
previous visit to your school.

718
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:43,710
I should like to inform you that I shall
certainly be back in the capitol by the

719
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:48,690
first or second month of next year.
Between now and then,

720
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,310
I expect to improve my
technique considerably.

721
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,840
I trust that you yourself will
not neglect your practice.

722
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,800
It would be a great shame if Yoshioka
Kempos flourishing school were to suffer

723
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:05,850
an a second defeat, like the one
that sustained last time I was there.

724
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:10,770
In closing, I send my respectful
wishes for your continued health.

725
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,030
Mostly Musashi,
so I love the little jabs.

726
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:19,230
You're flourishing school, wink. Ha Ha.

727
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:24,750
It's so jacked up, but yeah, that's
the old school talking smack, right?

728
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,770
Respect let's I kind of what they
do in the British parliament, right?

729
00:47:27,771 --> 00:47:30,040
Or Hamilton if you see the play thing.
I haven't

730
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,470
seen it like with kindest regards,
after you basically say,

731
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:35,410
I want to meet you and do with you
and shoot you in the face with kindest

732
00:47:35,411 --> 00:47:39,310
regards and wishes for your continued
health. You know, we've lost that.

733
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,990
There's something to that,
isn't there? You know, like,

734
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,890
can't you just have a feud and
still be respectful to someone?

735
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,210
I respect your intellect and your
capacities and yet I will stop at nothing

736
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,360
until I destroy it.

737
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,250
So this is another, a
dojo storm, which again,

738
00:47:57,251 --> 00:48:00,660
this is a modern term that I think Jiu
Jitsu people created. I don't know,

739
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,070
did you ever use the term
go to heard that before?

740
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:05,650
I've never heard Dojo storm before.
Oh,

741
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:09,880
Dojo storm is when you take your
Jujitsu guys and you go to another,

742
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:14,230
and this happened it again in San
Diego, San Diego. Where we live is,

743
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,640
is it's gone through the phase
already of all the schools being all,

744
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,500
all, uh, uh,

745
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,830
battling against each other
and, and really the battle,
there's multiple reasons.

746
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:29,650
One of them is because back
in the day before youtube,

747
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,160
you could actually have moves that you
could keep contained in your school and

748
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,420
you could say,
hey look,

749
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:37,120
don't show anyone this because we're
going to use this in the next tournament

750
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:40,480
and we want to, which is exactly what
happened in Japan too, by the way.

751
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,010
So what's the school with these schools?
So you'd have secret moves will now,

752
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,190
honestly with youtube and
every competition is on
youtube and you can watch

753
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,370
anybody from any school and you can see
what moves they're doing and there's all

754
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:55,320
this online so, so basically
there's no more secret school. Hey,

755
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:56,410
you can knowledge anymore.

756
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,860
The other thing is economically at one
time it was don't leave my school cause

757
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:03,011
you're my student.

758
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,340
You're giving me 150 bucks a month
and so don't go to another school.

759
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,810
And what that did initially it worked.
You could keep your students,

760
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,660
but people realize that
if you want to get good,

761
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:15,460
you have to get out and train
with other people sometimes.

762
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,940
And so if you weren't going to let
me go and train it, other schools,

763
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:20,410
sometimes I'm not going
to train at your school.

764
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:23,200
And so they would actually end up losing
students by trying to keep the students.

765
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:27,340
So I think that's it kind of leveled San
Diego out and other areas that are high

766
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:32,080
concentration jujitsu because yeah,
it's because now it's, you know,

767
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,050
people will come and go and train at
different schools and everyone's cool and

768
00:49:35,051 --> 00:49:36,970
it's,
it's just a much more mellow atmosphere.

769
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:41,230
And they'll last December in 2000 when
I first moved to the bay area and it was

770
00:49:41,231 --> 00:49:44,950
training in Jujitsu and I walked into the
school to take my first class and they

771
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,030
had, it wasn't very well
written from a legal standpoint,

772
00:49:49,031 --> 00:49:53,200
but they hadn't NDA a
nondisclosure agreement that
they had people sign so that

773
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,150
they would not teach the, the inner
workings and techniques of Said School.

774
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:59,200
Yeah,
exactly.

775
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:03,160
Has it used to be a lot tighter and I
think youtube pretty much is the thing

776
00:50:03,161 --> 00:50:06,520
that destroyed that. Uh,
but, but back in the day,

777
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,260
the Dojo storms would take place,

778
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,580
which was we would go from one school
and go to another school that was,

779
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:15,610
let's say a school is saying,
oh, we'll beat these guys.

780
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:19,360
Are we have better Jujitsu? Oh really?
You got Better Jiu Jitsu? Cool. Hello.

781
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,590
How are you doing?
We're here to see who did.

782
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:24,760
Jujitsu is better and it's a Dojo storm
and show up and, and you, you know,

783
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,180
everything is determined on the mat.
That's a beautiful thing about, uh,

784
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,600
so this is old school,

785
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,950
a Dojo storming and this is
against Jose [inaudible].

786
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:40,240
Jose [inaudible]. I'd have to see you.
How's it spelled? H. O. Z. O. I. N? Yup.

787
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:41,893
That's right

788
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:48,650
here we go for a Dojo storm and
he's, he's, he's showing up.

789
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:51,830
They're kind of looking
for where the school is.

790
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:55,070
He's kind of like a little bit lost
looking around for where the actual school

791
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:57,830
is and there's a priest that he's
working with. When he reappeared,

792
00:50:57,831 --> 00:51:00,500
the priest handed him a
registry and inkbox box saying,

793
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:03,950
write down your name and where you
studied and what style you use.

794
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,530
He spoke as though instructing a child.

795
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,740
The title on the registry was list of
persons visiting this temple to study

796
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,720
steward of the holy zone.

797
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:19,340
Musashi opened the book and glanced over
the names each listed to under the date

798
00:51:19,341 --> 00:51:24,110
on which the Samurai or student had called
following the style of the last entry.

799
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,200
He wrote down the required information
omitting the name of his teacher.

800
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,320
The priest, of course, was especially
interested in that Musashi.

801
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:35,330
His answer was essentially the one
he'd given at the Yoshiko school.

802
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:40,070
He had practiced the use of the truncheon
under his father without working very

803
00:51:40,071 --> 00:51:40,904
hard at it.

804
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:44,840
Since making up in his mind to study
an earnest he had taken has his teacher

805
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:49,730
everything in the universe as well as
the example set by his predecessors

806
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,430
throughout the country.
He ended up by saying,

807
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,840
I'm still in the process
of learning learning. Hmm.

808
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,840
You probably know this already,
but since the time of our first master,

809
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,500
the Joseon has been celebrated
everywhere for it's lance techniques.

810
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,370
The fighting that goes on here is a
rough and there are no exceptions.

811
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,710
Before you go on,

812
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,950
perhaps you better read what's written
at the beginning of the registry.

813
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:16,820
Musashi picked up the book,
opened it and read the stipulation,

814
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,910
which he had skipped over before.
It said,

815
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:22,130
having come here for the purpose of study,

816
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,630
I absolve the temple of all responsibility
in the event that I suffer bodily

817
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:31,580
injury or I'm killed. I agree to
that said Musashi with a slight grin.

818
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,840
It amounted to no more than common
sense for anyone committed to becoming a

819
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:38,720
warrior. All right. This way.

820
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,450
So that's the introduction
and that's actually cool too.

821
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,990
That's an old school Jujitsu
thing when you'd come in for the,

822
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,560
the other thing that would
happen is challenge matches.

823
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,200
And I don't know if you've seen videos
from the old school Gracie Academy at the

824
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:51,650
challenge matches, but those guys would
come in and sign a waiver like, Hey,

825
00:52:51,651 --> 00:52:56,390
if you die, we're not really, we're
not liable. So the uh, the old, uh,

826
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:02,300
the gray market, black market copy
over copy, VHS of Gracie in action.

827
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:06,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We had my,
my old teacher, Fabio Santos,

828
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:12,220
and he had videos of himself doing Gracie
challenge matches at the Gracie school

829
00:53:12,891 --> 00:53:16,280
up in Torrance and he would play him
for us. And it's the same thing. Yup.

830
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:19,250
Sign your waiver and then you're going
to get your arm broken. By the way.

831
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:22,750
First I put Aql Lik Deanna [inaudible].

832
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:30,050
So if this point he goes into the
school and there's some bad ass,

833
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,770
he's not the head of the school,

834
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:34,710
but he's like their best guy and
he's up there kicking everyone's ass.

835
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,130
You say next and he's roughs
the guy up and kicks his ass.

836
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:43,150
Then next roughs that guy up next and
finally no one else wants to fight him and

837
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,030
here we go. This guy's name is og.
I gone a g o. N. O Gorman. Yeah,

838
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:53,240
I'd gone with an unusual, he's the guy
that's been rough and everyone up, is it?

839
00:53:53,241 --> 00:53:57,630
Or is there no one else build are
gone now holding his practice.

840
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,650
Lance horizontally.

841
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,240
The brawny steward was comparing his
registry with the faces of the weighting

842
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:08,100
men. He poured at one? No, not today. I'll
come again some other time. How about,

843
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:11,550
you know, I don't feel quite
up to it today. One by one,

844
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:15,390
they backed out until Musashi Musashi
saw the finger pointing at him.

845
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,040
How about you? If you
please, if you please.

846
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,130
What's that supposed to mean?
It means I'd like to fight.

847
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:31,800
Um, yeah. And so he, he's going to go,

848
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:35,400
and I'm going to pull a couple highlights
out of this thing, but, but, but the,

849
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,030
this guy, if you, if you please.
So this guy had gone, he,

850
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:44,600
he immediately does like a practice run
at some board that he puts his lance

851
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:49,110
right through. And it's sort of like
an intimidation tactic, righty. Oh,

852
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:50,460
you want to train? Cool. Watch this.

853
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,790
He screams and he puts his lance
right through this, this, uh,

854
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:59,490
right through this thing.
And it's actually, there's a,

855
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,920
there's a, the old guy that had
brought him into that, it broadened me,

856
00:55:02,921 --> 00:55:07,050
saw she's looking at him and saying,
Hey, don't be a fool. You look stupid.

857
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,860
That's not a board you're
about to take on. Meaning like,

858
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:13,500
you just killed the board,
the piece of wood. But that's,

859
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,610
this guy is not just a board.
Um,

860
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,420
but it's don't hit back. Yeah. And, and,

861
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,670
and paper targets don't shoot
back and they don't move.

862
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,910
That's something I've
said many, many times. Um,

863
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,650
Musashi then says after he does this,
you know,

864
00:55:31,651 --> 00:55:35,880
like this crazy scream and puts his
glance through the wood. He says,

865
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,020
are you ready?
Now

866
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,860
back to the book.
This solicit to you drove a gone wild.

867
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:47,850
His muscles were like steel when he
jumped. He did so with awesome lightness.

868
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:51,060
His feet seem to be on the floor and in
the air at the same time quivering like

869
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,920
the moonlight on ocean waves.

870
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,570
Musashi stood perfectly still or so it
seemed there was nothing unusual about

871
00:55:57,571 --> 00:56:00,810
his stance. He held his sword
straight out with both hands,

872
00:56:00,811 --> 00:56:04,980
but being slightly smaller
than his opponent and not
so conspicuously muscular.

873
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,790
He looked almost casual.
The greatest difference was in their eyes,

874
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,670
Musashi's were sharp as a bird.
Their pupils,

875
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:16,830
a co clear coral tinted with blood at
gone shook his head perhaps to shake off

876
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:19,050
the streams of sweat pouring
down from his forehead,

877
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,160
perhaps to shake off the old man's a
warning wards. Had they lingered on,

878
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,710
was he attempting to cast him out
of his mind? Whatever the reason,

879
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,450
he was extremely agitated.

880
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:32,140
He repeatedly shifted his position
trying to draw out Musashi.

881
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:37,090
But Musashi remained motionless at God's
lunch was accompanied by a piercing

882
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:41,450
scream in the split second that decided
the encounter Musashi parried to

883
00:56:41,451 --> 00:56:42,340
encounter attacked.

884
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:43,770
Yeah.

885
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:48,510
What happened at God's fellow priest
hastily ran over and crowded around him in

886
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:51,240
a black circle in the general confusion.

887
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,840
Some tripped over his practice and,
and went sprawling.

888
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,370
A pre stood up his hands and chest
smeared with blood shouting medicine,

889
00:56:59,371 --> 00:57:03,060
bring the medicine quick.
You won't need any medicine.

890
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:08,040
It was the old man who had come in the
front entrance and quint quickly assessed

891
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:12,720
the situation. His face turns sour.
If I thought medicine would save him,

892
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:15,060
I wouldn't have tried to
stop him in the first place.

893
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,630
So that's it.
Musashi one shot,

894
00:57:21,631 --> 00:57:26,010
one kill takes the dude
out. And um, interestingly,

895
00:57:26,011 --> 00:57:26,850
here's the advice.

896
00:57:26,851 --> 00:57:31,851
So that guy that had taken him in
is the actual master and he says,

897
00:57:32,191 --> 00:57:34,920
uh, is your name Miyamoto
Musashi? That's correct.

898
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,810
Under whom did you study the martial arts?

899
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,000
I've had no teacher in the ordinary sense.

900
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,030
My father taught me how to use the
challenge in when I was young. Since then,

901
00:57:42,031 --> 00:57:44,970
I've picked up a number of points
from the older SAML and Sam Rhine,

902
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:49,320
various provinces. I've also spent some
time traveling about the countryside,

903
00:57:49,321 --> 00:57:54,120
learning from the mountains and the
rivers. I regard them too as teachers.

904
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,320
You seem to have the right attitude,
but you're so strong, much too strong,

905
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:02,910
believing he was being praised,
Musashi blushed and said, oh no,

906
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:07,110
I'm still immature. I'm always making
blunders. That is not what I mean.

907
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,030
Your strength is your problem. You must
learn to control it, become weaker,

908
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:16,760
which also fun to do. And I'm
thinking about doing this, uh,

909
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,460
when I reread this book in full again,

910
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,340
is to spend some time on
youtube watching yeah.

911
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,260
A high level Kendall competition

912
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:33,230
to see how fast it is. Yeah.
Just to get an idea of the,

913
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,140
how much can transpire
in the blink of an eye.

914
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,900
Is there a referee that calls
it as a kill shot? How does it,

915
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:41,980
how does it get scored?

916
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,340
There are referees. So
I had a chance to, uh,

917
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,380
to train in Kendo when I went back
to Japan about eight years ago,

918
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,360
something like that,
eight or 10 years ago.

919
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:57,361
And I trained at this place called the
Qa Kang and I still have the armor still

920
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:03,460
have everything. And you, you have too
much like calling your shots and pool.

921
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:08,050
You have to call your target a split
second before you hit it or as you hit it

922
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:12,460
and see what's it like
men, his head, uh, Dole,

923
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:16,060
his abdomen,
Colt is the gauntlet or the arm.

924
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:21,000
And then [inaudible] is a jab to the
throat, which is pretty nasty. Uh,

925
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,360
and you line up in such
a way the sword is,

926
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:26,630
the tip of the sword is basically pointing
at your opponents throat as you track

927
00:59:26,631 --> 00:59:28,820
them.
And you can see,

928
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,690
but there are referees
in cases of any type of,

929
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,490
they're definitely referees
in cases of any dispute.

930
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:35,900
They're very rarely disputes,

931
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,310
but it's so subtle and the,
the,

932
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:44,480
the misses are so close, much
like really maybe high, really,

933
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:47,300
really high level boxing.
I mean when someone Perry's,

934
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:49,580
it's not like it's traveling a
foot to the side of their head,

935
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:53,540
it's just grazing the side of their
head and then they counter punch.

936
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:58,340
Then you see it in Kendo, the movements
just faster. So it's really wild to see,

937
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:02,830
get your bell rung when you get hit.
I expected because I saw the armor,

938
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:07,040
the armor seems pretty hard that you
don't, you absolutely get your Bell Rung.

939
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:11,360
Especially I remember my
first class and you know,

940
01:00:11,361 --> 01:00:13,430
I'm bigger than a lot of Japanese guys.
Not all.

941
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,470
I mean there's certainly
some big Japanese guys, uh,

942
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,200
and I was more heavily muscled and
they're like, oh, okay. And there's,

943
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:24,140
and most of the, Jeff, this has been
my experience in Japanese schools,

944
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:25,840
whether it's judo, Jujitsu, Ken know,

945
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:30,910
otherwise spend some time way back in
the day with the pancreas guys and so on

946
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:31,843
before.

947
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,440
And then they really came to
the u s is generally speaking,

948
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:38,060
everyone's pretty cool.

949
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,480
I suppose this is true in the u s two
then there just one or two guys were like,

950
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:45,650
oh, foreigner in my school.
Okay, I want to ring your bell.

951
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:50,660
And, uh, there was one guy there who
wanted to, wanted to fight and I was like,

952
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,510
okay, because I figured like
my reflexes are pretty good.

953
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:58,130
But the reflexes of head
movement in Kendo, bad idea,

954
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,600
you always want to have
the sword in between, uh,

955
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:04,670
you and your opponent and
to protect the center line.

956
01:01:04,671 --> 01:01:09,671
So if you start moving your head or your
shoulders in such a way that you might

957
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:14,510
say of Aveda Punch, you really expose
yourself. So I ended up getting a whacked,

958
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,860
not just on the top of the head but
behind the armor because your back is open

959
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,030
in the back of your head is open.

960
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:24,380
And so I ended up getting whacked like
on the upper traps and neck with these

961
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:27,920
Shinai, these bamboo
swords, which hurt I, those,

962
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:30,530
those absolutely will ring your
bell. So yeah, you feel it.

963
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,090
You're familiar with the dog brothers,
right? Yeah. Those, they bring it,

964
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,930
they really bring it, they're awesome.
I have nothing but respect for the dog.

965
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:40,940
But if you don't know what they are,
you can check them out on youtube.

966
01:01:40,941 --> 01:01:45,860
But they do full contact,
simulated knife and stick.

967
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,890
And I think it started with stick
fighting started with stick. Yeah.

968
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,310
Start with a screamer. And my
understanding is they have the gathering.

969
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,180
I haven't see,

970
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,970
I was watching these videos at the same
time as watching the Gracie in action

971
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,970
videos. And I remember like, oh,

972
01:01:58,971 --> 01:02:01,760
people were just learning what a
triangle choke was. It's like, Ooh,

973
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,010
I can show people in my legs.
I was a new thing.

974
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,440
And I remember thinking this video of,

975
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:09,500
I think it was the gathering where
you have salty dog and so on.

976
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:14,360
And the participants who come just have
to mutually agree on which weapons are

977
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:16,810
acceptable.
See definitely one guy with a garden hose.

978
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,680
And then another guy was like,
I Kendo sword with like the tip cut offs.

979
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,630
It's splayed open.
And then they would go at it.

980
01:02:24,631 --> 01:02:27,720
And I remember this one point
I saw this guy pull guard.

981
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:30,780
You know the people are just going nuts.
Some people have lacrosse helmets on.

982
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:33,180
I mean it's like, it's
just bonkers, Mad Max.

983
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:37,560
And these two guys are going at it and uh,
one's clearly a wrestler.

984
01:02:37,561 --> 01:02:42,110
He takes the guy down and gets caught
in a triangle and I'm like, oh,

985
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:45,030
I guess that's it. I was like, no,
that's not it. And the guy took his,

986
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,110
his escrima stick and took the end of it
and just shoved it right in between the

987
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:52,950
guy's ass cheeks. Great Way to
break the triangle. It turns out.

988
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,690
And then just getting,

989
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,480
then just proceeded to beat the living
shit out of him with a stick on the

990
01:02:57,481 --> 01:03:02,040
ground. That's not fun. I don't
like that. Trying to offense at all.

991
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,480
Don't like that at all.
Um,

992
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,000
I think we're getting
into another just good.

993
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:15,330
He's,
he's about to meet up with these more,

994
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,350
more of these hustling
guys for some battle.

995
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:23,070
All the priests carried Lance's
blacks leaves, talked up,

996
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:24,090
they were ready for action,

997
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:28,410
apparently set upon avenging the death of
a gone and restoring the temples honor.

998
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,500
They looked grotesque like
so many demons from hell.

999
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:36,960
The Ronin formed a semicircle so they
could watch the show and at the same time

1000
01:03:36,961 --> 01:03:41,670
keep Musashi from escaping.
This precaution, however,

1001
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:44,460
proved unnecessary from Musashi,

1002
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:48,540
showed no signs of either
running or backing down. In fact,

1003
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,930
he was walking steadily
and directly toward them.

1004
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:56,700
Slowly pace by pace. He advanced looking
as if he might pounce it any moment.

1005
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,310
For a moment there was an ominous silence
as both sides contemplated approaching

1006
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:03,144
death.

1007
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:08,570
Musashi's fleece face went deadly white
and through his eyes stared the eyes of

1008
01:04:09,871 --> 01:04:12,690
the god of vengeance
glittering with venom.

1009
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:15,920
He was selecting his prey,

1010
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:17,780
okay?

1011
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:20,360
Neither the Ronin nor the
priest wears tents is Musashi.

1012
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:23,960
Their numbers gave them confidence
and their optimism was unshakeable.

1013
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,850
Still no one wanted it to be attacked,

1014
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:30,350
wanted to be the first attacked a priest
at the end of the column of the Lancers

1015
01:04:30,351 --> 01:04:34,310
gave a signal, and without breaking
formation, they rust around to Musashi's.

1016
01:04:34,311 --> 01:04:39,200
Right Musashi, I am in. Shawn
shouted, the same priest.

1017
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:44,030
I'm told you came while I was away
away and killed a gone that you later

1018
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:48,830
publicly insulted the honor of the ozone
that you mocked us by having posters

1019
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:53,720
put up all over town. Is this true? No.
Shouted Musashi. If you're a priest,

1020
01:04:53,721 --> 01:04:56,330
you should know better than to
trust only what you see in here.

1021
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:01,100
You should consider things with your
mind and spirit. It was like pointing,

1022
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:05,390
pouring oil on the flames, ignoring
their leader. The priest began to shout,

1023
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,760
saying, talk was cheap.
It was time to fight.

1024
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:12,740
They were enthusiastically seconded by
the and who had grouped themselves in

1025
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:15,590
close formation and we saw
she's left screaming, cursing,

1026
01:05:15,591 --> 01:05:19,630
and waving their swords in the air.
They Egged the priests on into action.

1027
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,050
Musashi convinced that the road
and we're all mouth and no fight,

1028
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,510
suddenly turned to them and shouted,
all right,

1029
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:29,660
which one of you wants to come forward?
All but two or three fell back a plate.

1030
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,780
Taste each sure that we saw she's evil.

1031
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:36,050
I was upon him to the two or three
brave ones stood ready, swords out,

1032
01:05:36,051 --> 01:05:40,420
stretched in issuing a
challenge in the wink of an eye.

1033
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:44,500
Musashi was on on one of
them like a fighting cock.

1034
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:48,250
There was a sound of a popping
cork and the ground turned red.

1035
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:52,390
Then came a chilling noise.
Not a battle cry, not a curse,

1036
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:57,310
but it truly bud blood curdling howl,
Musashi sword,

1037
01:05:57,311 --> 01:06:01,420
screeched back and forth through the air.
A reverberation in its own body.

1038
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,570
In his own body telling him when
he connected with human bone,

1039
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:10,000
blood and brains spattered from his blade
fingers and arms flew through the air

1040
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:15,280
most of the time. Musashi wasn't
really conscious of what he was doing.

1041
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:16,890
He was in a sort of trance,

1042
01:06:16,891 --> 01:06:21,550
a murderous dream in which body and soul
were concentrated in this three foot

1043
01:06:21,551 --> 01:06:25,900
sword unconsciously.
His whole life experience,

1044
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:28,450
the knowledge his father
had beaten into him.

1045
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,430
What he had learned at the sec of Jara,

1046
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:34,740
the theories he had heard at the
various schools of swordsmanship,

1047
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:37,030
the lessons taught to him
by the mountains and trees.

1048
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:40,000
Everything came into play in
the rapid movements of his body.

1049
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:45,720
He became a disembodied whirlwind mowing
down the heard of Ronan who buy their

1050
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:50,560
stunned bewilderment,
left themselves wide open to his sword.

1051
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:55,290
I'm trying to think of why
these particular passages,

1052
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:58,140
but one of the things know
this disembodiment which
I talk about all the time.

1053
01:06:58,141 --> 01:07:03,141
Being able to be detached from what's
happening is so important as a person,

1054
01:07:03,901 --> 01:07:08,070
as a leader and as a, you know in
martial arts you have to do it too.

1055
01:07:08,071 --> 01:07:12,060
If you're getting so wrapped up around
the fought of what's happening you,

1056
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:14,970
you won't make good decisions. But
this actually goes beyond it. This,

1057
01:07:14,971 --> 01:07:17,310
this is like getting in the
zone. This is, you know,

1058
01:07:17,311 --> 01:07:19,800
when you're not thinking anymore, and
I always say in Jujitsu, if you're,

1059
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,660
if you're thinking about your next move,
it's too late.

1060
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,610
That person's already
doing something to you.

1061
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:28,650
But that idea of being disembodied and
being detached and not thinking about

1062
01:07:28,651 --> 01:07:33,000
what you're doing but just doing it is,
is epic if you can do it.

1063
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,380
And, uh, we were, we were
chatting a little bit, uh, Echo,

1064
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:41,610
you and I before we started recording
about Marcello Garcia in New York.

1065
01:07:41,611 --> 01:07:44,850
And I've spent some time with Martin
Marcello and rolled with Marcello and

1066
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:49,920
I'm not by any stretch,
I would say good at Jujitsu,

1067
01:07:49,921 --> 01:07:53,010
but nonetheless had a chance to spend
some time on the mat with him and a

1068
01:07:53,011 --> 01:07:55,740
handful of other guys,
sweetest guy you could ever imagine.

1069
01:07:55,741 --> 01:07:57,120
For people who don't know the name,

1070
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:01,560
I suppose it's fair to say that
Michael Jordan, Mike Tyson,

1071
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:06,750
Wayne Gretzky of Jujitsu wrapped
into one. He's, he's just, uh,

1072
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,800
kind of like the, the Kimura
after which the camera is named.

1073
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:14,070
So who was a very famous judoka
and also really good at Jujitsu,

1074
01:08:14,071 --> 01:08:19,071
fought Helio Gracie people in Japan used
to say before Kimora know Kimora after

1075
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:21,500
crew after Kimora, no, Q Moreau,

1076
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:26,360
like a nonrecurring phenomenon and uh,

1077
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:31,400
Marcello's I mean gotta be close to
that. I mean he's, he's really good.

1078
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:35,630
And one of the things that you observe
with Marcello and Josh Waitzkin who cones

1079
01:08:35,631 --> 01:08:38,780
the school with him was very close friend
of mine and also considered a chess

1080
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:42,840
prodigy. He was the basis for searching
for Bobby Fischer. He says that, you know,

1081
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:46,370
Marcel was a nickname is the,
I think the king of the scramble,

1082
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,850
but he doesn't view it as a scramble.
Uh,

1083
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:52,400
and what,
uh,

1084
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:57,430
what Josh was telling me is that
Marcello can basically see a move in and

1085
01:08:57,741 --> 01:09:01,580
movement in general in more
frames per second. So we're,

1086
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:06,581
most people see position a transition
that is kind of undefined to position B.

1087
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,900
He sees 30 positions in between a and B.
And you see that when a,

1088
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:14,870
if you,
if you want to really see some wild stuff,

1089
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:17,110
you can check out just to
look up the Marcello teen,

1090
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,990
which is his brand of guilty
in which is really, uh,

1091
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:22,200
it's,

1092
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:27,200
it's so technical for something that
can be so sloppy when people don't know

1093
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:28,030
what they are.

1094
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:33,030
It's so tactical and he can catch people
in a guillotine from any conceivable

1095
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:39,080
position that most people wouldn't even
consider a position. I've seen him,

1096
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:43,850
I seen him catch people and Guillotine
people who weigh like 300 pounds and not

1097
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:46,040
fat, 300 like big, big, big people.

1098
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,640
And then they try to come around his
legs into saying north south position and

1099
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:57,341
he gets them to tap when they appeared
to have him in a north south position.

1100
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:03,490
Um, but he seems to be able to access this
same type of mind state at will. Yeah.

1101
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,620
I mean obviously it has to do
with these training all the time.

1102
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:09,110
I mean all the time and yeah,
all the time.

1103
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:12,650
And he just has turns his mind off of
it and his body's working without them.

1104
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:13,131
I bet you,

1105
01:10:13,131 --> 01:10:16,610
I bet you if you hooked up like brain
scan and you see what he's thinking about,

1106
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:21,590
he's probably thinking about like
chicken for dinner or whatever.

1107
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:23,750
You know what I mean?
Like these thoughts are just not there.

1108
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:26,450
But that's how I feel when I have good,
when I could do good Jujitsu,

1109
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,150
I come off the mat and I
don't, someone will say, Hey,

1110
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,550
what was that move you did on me? I'm
like, I have no idea what I just did,

1111
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:34,410
you know? I just have no idea.
I don't know what happened. And,

1112
01:10:34,580 --> 01:10:36,290
and sometimes if you're
thinking about something,

1113
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:39,890
you might remember bits and pieces,
but that's what he's talking about.

1114
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:43,850
And that section is like, hey, it's
not even, you're not even there. It's,

1115
01:10:43,910 --> 01:10:47,270
it's all the trainings there,
the things you've been instructed,

1116
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:48,350
the practice that you've done,

1117
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,440
that's what's there and that's
what's executing the movements. Yeah.

1118
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:54,770
It's a beautiful place to be. Whenever
people talk asking me about meditation,

1119
01:10:55,660 --> 01:11:00,250
like do you meditate? Jocko
Mcgee do Jujitsu, you know?
Oh, I agree with that. Yeah.

1120
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,710
I think of the brain. Yeah. I mean it's,

1121
01:11:02,711 --> 01:11:07,711
it's just present state awareness and
not endlessly thinking about whatever it

1122
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:13,950
is that might occupy and distract you.
Otherwise it gives you that.

1123
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,670
Actually somebody asked me that the
other day and I was doing an event.

1124
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:21,360
The guy says, you know, how do you,
how do you recharge your batteries?

1125
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:23,370
Like it just seems like you're
going hard all the time.

1126
01:11:23,371 --> 01:11:27,600
How do you recharge your batteries? And my
initial, I, I actually responded. I said,

1127
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:30,350
look, I don't, to be honest with you,
I don't really recharge. I'm going,

1128
01:11:30,351 --> 01:11:34,440
I'm just going and there's this. And then
as I thought about it, I said, actually,

1129
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:38,790
no, I'm wrong. I recharge all the
time. I'm solar powered, solar powered.

1130
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:42,930
I moved myself to get energized, right?
And look the windup watch or whatever.

1131
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:47,690
But no, the reality is
is I recharge myself, um,

1132
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,620
through physical activity.

1133
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:53,220
That's where I recharge myself is by
surfing in Jujitsu and working out.

1134
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,210
That's the recharge.

1135
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:57,550
So just to build on that,

1136
01:11:57,551 --> 01:12:01,390
because I think it's really important
people think of recharging as,

1137
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:06,460
as physical rest,
but a lot,

1138
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:10,090
if anyone has really gone through a very,
very stressful period in their lives,

1139
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:12,730
whether that's the death of
a loved one or a breakup,

1140
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:14,590
anything that you obsessive Lee,

1141
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:19,591
think about you can not move for most
of the day and feel like you've run five

1142
01:12:20,021 --> 01:12:20,854
marathons.

1143
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:25,510
So by getting out of your head and into
your body saying Jujitsu or surfing,

1144
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:31,030
you're taking a break from these leaders
that we can replay that are what?

1145
01:12:32,561 --> 01:12:33,860
Drain the battery.
Yeah.

1146
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,710
Yeah. I think it's, I,
you know, again, uh,

1147
01:12:36,711 --> 01:12:39,610
luckily the guy asked me that question
and I realized as I was answering it,

1148
01:12:39,620 --> 01:12:41,940
you know, first I sounded like
an arrogant jerk. I was that guy.

1149
01:12:42,010 --> 01:12:46,910
Although he's on auto need no recharge.
No, that's not true. Actually.

1150
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,760
If I go days without training
or without working out,

1151
01:12:49,761 --> 01:12:52,910
I start to feel like crap and I, and how
do I recharge? I get home and I'm like,

1152
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:56,210
oh, there's my squat rack and or there's
the mat and you can get on it and train.

1153
01:12:56,211 --> 01:12:57,050
So yeah,
that's

1154
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:03,900
totally true. Totally true.
One quick story of that
Marcello, which also makes me,

1155
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:05,730
you can tell Marcel was
20 for the rest thing.

1156
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:08,970
Think about Musashi is a,

1157
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,040
he's famous for being hard to find when
he gets called to the mat when it's his

1158
01:13:14,551 --> 01:13:18,270
turn to compete even at a
world championship level.

1159
01:13:18,690 --> 01:13:23,690
And he is almost always found because
Josh has had to track him down a few times

1160
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:30,150
asleep like in between the
bleachers and Vic Marcella Marcella,

1161
01:13:30,151 --> 01:13:32,280
you're up and be like, oh, okay, cool.

1162
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:36,210
And he'll like get up and stretch
and literally walk 50 feet,

1163
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,350
like seven seconds later on to the
mat for the finals and the world

1164
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,900
championships and just turn
it on and then destroy people.

1165
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:45,950
And that's cool too. And I, I
don't know if I hit it in the book,

1166
01:13:45,951 --> 01:13:49,220
but that's one of Musashi's things
is Musashi would show up late,

1167
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:52,340
he'd have duals and he'd show
up hour late, 15 minutes late,

1168
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:55,460
20 minutes late and have that
person getting all frustrated.

1169
01:13:56,450 --> 01:14:00,990
Yeah, no, it's, I mean it's, I
was thinking about this because I,

1170
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,940
I was,
uh,

1171
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:07,520
I remember this about Musashi and I
was trying to think of how to explain

1172
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:14,950
in a culture like in that period what's
showing up an hour late might equate to

1173
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:20,290
in the US it would be like coming
over to meet someone at their house,

1174
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,470
shaking their hand,

1175
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:24,430
sitting down at the dinner table than
like getting up on the dinner table and

1176
01:14:24,431 --> 01:14:27,850
taking a shit right on there.
It's like,

1177
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,150
and then asking them to clean it up
cause it smells bad. Like it would be,

1178
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,560
it would be that rude. So of course,
and it also made me think of this book,

1179
01:14:35,561 --> 01:14:37,600
I think it's called winning ugly.
It's about tennis,

1180
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:42,601
but it relates to this form
of psychological warfare
and like taking too much

1181
01:14:45,551 --> 01:14:46,001
time,

1182
01:14:46,001 --> 01:14:50,710
like in between serves and making your
opponent unnerved so that even if they're

1183
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:53,980
technically superior, you can end
up beating them. And Soon Musashi,

1184
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:57,370
it's the simplest trick in the book,
but he would show up late,

1185
01:14:57,550 --> 01:15:01,870
late and these people would
lose their minds. And uh,

1186
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:04,960
and then if they're like, oh,
this guy always shows up late.

1187
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:07,870
And then he'd show up three hours early
and scout the whole place out and then

1188
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:08,704
kill everybody.

1189
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:15,780
Good. Um, this was an interesting piece.

1190
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:20,940
Here's another weapon and he's working
with this guy who designs weapons and

1191
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:23,100
it's called the chain ball sickle.

1192
01:15:23,101 --> 01:15:25,770
So it's like the sickle and then a
chain and then a ball. But again,

1193
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:27,990
this is reminds me of Kung
Fu movies when I was a kid,

1194
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:33,440
but he's seen this and hear
this guy's name is bacon be a I.

1195
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,440
K. E. N biking. Biking. Did you just
chime in over there at Aqua Charles? Yeah.

1196
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:44,380
Why is that? Cause I know, but not on
letting you guys do anything. That's good.

1197
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:44,920
Good.

1198
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,490
Just be Japanese or something that you've
been holding out on me a little bit.

1199
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:50,820
Yeah, I do like the idea of
calling him bacon though.

1200
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:54,970
I might not have another kid.
I might even baking

1201
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:02,520
in Hawaii. The pronunciation is
very similar. Biking, biking,

1202
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,020
biking,
insisted.

1203
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:08,640
You said you wanted to hear more
about the chain ball sickle.

1204
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,730
I'll tell you everything I know, but let's
have a few drinks while we're talking.

1205
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:17,060
When he will return with a Saki bike
and poured some into a heating jar,

1206
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:21,570
put it on the fire and talk
to great length about the
chain ball sickle and ways

1207
01:16:21,571 --> 01:16:23,970
to use it to advantage in actual combat.

1208
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:28,200
The best thing about it he told saw she
was that unlike a sort of gave the enemy

1209
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:32,610
no time to defend himself.
Also before attacking the enemy directly,

1210
01:16:32,611 --> 01:16:35,610
it was possible to snatch his
weapon away from him with the chain.

1211
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:39,930
A skillful throw up the chain,
a sharp Yank and the enemy had no sword.

1212
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:44,700
Still seated. Bacon, Dem
biking demonstrated a stance.

1213
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,660
You see you hold the sickle in your
left hand and the ball and you're right.

1214
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,460
If the enemy comes at you, take him
with, take him on with the blade,

1215
01:16:53,490 --> 01:16:57,720
then hurl the ball at his face. That's
one way. Changing positions he went on.

1216
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,870
Now in this case, when there's some
space between you and the enemy,

1217
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,910
you take his weapon away with the chain.

1218
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:06,090
It doesn't make any difference
what kind of weapon it is. A sword.

1219
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:11,150
Lance wouldn't staff or whatever bike
and went on and on telling Musashi about

1220
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:15,110
the ways of throwing the ball about the
10 or more oral traditions concerning

1221
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:19,040
the weapon about how the chain was like
a snake about how it was possible by

1222
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:22,880
cleverly alternating movements of the
chain and sickle to create optical

1223
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:27,881
illusions and caused the enemy's defense
to work to his own detriment about all

1224
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:29,480
the secret ways of using the weapon.

1225
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:33,410
Musashi was fascinated when
he heard talk like this.

1226
01:17:33,411 --> 01:17:38,360
He listened with his whole body eager
to absorb every detail, the chain,

1227
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,620
the sickle two hands.
As he listened,

1228
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:45,710
the seeds of other thoughts
formed in his mind.

1229
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,320
The sword can be used with one hand,

1230
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,620
but a man has two hands and that's
where he gets this idea of uh,

1231
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:59,490
for using two sorts when he fights.
And I'm sure you know more about that.

1232
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,770
So yeah,
so he

1233
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:08,550
originated as style that
has many different names.

1234
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:13,380
Uh, I think, uh, there, there
are a few different of it.

1235
01:18:13,381 --> 01:18:14,580
I'm probably going to get this incorrect,

1236
01:18:14,581 --> 01:18:19,440
but there's like Nita Nietzsche I think
is one way to say it, uh, but the,

1237
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:25,940
the form of having one long sword
and then the equivalent of say,

1238
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,570
I would imagine in the military of of
uh, like a side arm, uh, like a pistol.

1239
01:18:30,571 --> 01:18:34,560
So you have your primary and then you
would have your, whatever it might be,

1240
01:18:35,370 --> 01:18:37,860
you know,
a Glock 19 or whatever.

1241
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:43,640
And Typically Samurai would use their
primary and then failing that if it broke

1242
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,390
or if it would, if they were disarmed,
then they would use their shorter sword.

1243
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:53,520
And he would in some cases utilize
both simultaneously, which was very,

1244
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,301
very highly,

1245
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:59,160
highly unusual and requires a completely
different method of fighting because

1246
01:18:59,161 --> 01:19:01,260
the grip on the sword is very,
very particular.

1247
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,850
When you look at say at Kendo Sword
and how it's positioned. Uh, if you,

1248
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,540
uh,
if you have then two swords,

1249
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:14,130
it requires a completely different
repertoire of technique. And I don't know,

1250
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:16,890
I don't recall offhand if
they get into it in this book,

1251
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:20,100
but we saw she was also an expert in,

1252
01:19:20,370 --> 01:19:24,390
in weaponry throwing.
So there were instances,

1253
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:28,530
and I would have loved to have seen this
and I'm sure there's a video on youtube

1254
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:29,460
of someone trying this,

1255
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,760
but he would routinely throw his shorter
sword and also later on because he was

1256
01:19:36,781 --> 01:19:38,220
in a,
I don't want to skip too far ahead,

1257
01:19:38,221 --> 01:19:43,020
but he would also instruct in the use of
shooken, which are the throwing stars.

1258
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:48,210
So he was an expert at throwing
weapons as well as wielding the sword.

1259
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:50,580
Uh, and uh, it's,

1260
01:19:50,581 --> 01:19:55,581
it's a completely different school of
training that some people still use.

1261
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,200
And Kendo at the highest levels.

1262
01:19:58,201 --> 01:20:01,280
I haven't seen it very much because I
think there aren't as many teachers.

1263
01:20:01,281 --> 01:20:04,980
Is that legal? It is legal
as far as I can tell. Yeah.

1264
01:20:04,981 --> 01:20:08,760
There were people who I've seen
demonstrated and you can find some video,

1265
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:12,660
not much, but a little bit of video
of using one short and one long.

1266
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:18,210
Uh, and it's, it's, they're
not a degree of difference.

1267
01:20:18,211 --> 01:20:20,950
They're different species all together.
Yeah.

1268
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:23,221
That's weird.

1269
01:20:23,221 --> 01:20:28,221
Sometimes when I'm rolling Jujitsu and
you get sweaty enough and slippery enough

1270
01:20:28,351 --> 01:20:31,470
and it's, it's a, it's a little bit
of a different sport. Oh totally.

1271
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,370
Like it's like you are not going to be
able to do this to me right now because

1272
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:39,570
I'm just too slippery. And, and same
with g and Nogi and it's weird, you know,

1273
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:42,690
of course I always tell people like GE
and Nogi they're different but they're

1274
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:46,080
the same and,
and then it goes one degree further.

1275
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,810
Cause when you get just
super slippery Nogi it's,

1276
01:20:49,230 --> 01:20:53,250
it's about the difference between ghee
and Nogi. Maybe not quite as much,

1277
01:20:53,251 --> 01:20:56,760
but another Marcello
story. Yeah. Can't resist.

1278
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:00,090
So I trained with Dave Camp
Maria for a period of time.

1279
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:04,260
Who is one of my favorite human beings
and just a sweetheart of a guy and a hell

1280
01:21:04,261 --> 01:21:07,370
of a competitor and also high level judo.
Yeah.

1281
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:09,140
And so when he competed in Jujitsu,

1282
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:13,830
most people were terrified of his standup
and they would kick their hips back

1283
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:17,160
and then he would do a flying arm bar
and routinely used flying armbars on.

1284
01:21:17,161 --> 01:21:19,280
Everyone here uses a total beast to just,

1285
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:23,460
I was on the competition circuit around
the same time as him and some of the

1286
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:26,640
other guys we were talking about earlier
and they, yeah, they were killers.

1287
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,260
So Dave went to New York and trained
with Marcel for a period of time.

1288
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:34,740
And to me, I mean, Dave, he's a
high level competitor. Like I've,

1289
01:21:34,741 --> 01:21:37,320
I've never seen Dave thrown
around or anything like that.

1290
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,950
And so he's telling me about his
experience and he's friends with Marcel,

1291
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:46,560
but the experience of, of rolling Nogi
and I was like, oh, well that makes,

1292
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:48,660
I suppose that makes sense.
I've heard so much about Marcello,

1293
01:21:48,661 --> 01:21:51,750
but once you put on the
gear was different game,

1294
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:54,330
I assume because of all your experience
that you had. And he's like, no,

1295
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,130
it was even worse. Yeah.
I find that with Dean,

1296
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,520
my buddy dean, who is, you know,

1297
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:05,280
world champion multiple times with no
[inaudible] and everyone thinks, oh,

1298
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:07,980
well if you put the key on, maybe you
can neutralize them and stuff. No,

1299
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:11,260
it's worse because you can't
move at all and he doesn't.

1300
01:22:11,261 --> 01:22:16,110
And it's not like he doesn't know
Jujitsu with g, he's savage is there.

1301
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:19,290
Someone's really good.
It gives them more control.

1302
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,820
They already have control over you.

1303
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:24,030
Now they have even more control and
now they have handles. It's not fun.

1304
01:22:26,030 --> 01:22:30,840
Uh, do you got one you want to read?
You know? Yeah. I want to just,

1305
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:31,531
these are,

1306
01:22:31,531 --> 01:22:36,531
these are things that I highlighted
when I was really just coming into the

1307
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:42,741
professional world and felt like I
needed to toughen myself on a number of

1308
01:22:43,381 --> 01:22:46,860
different levels.
And this is one that I highlighted.

1309
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:48,600
This is from fairly early in the book,

1310
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:54,320
which means it's like the end of a
normal book early in the book and it's

1311
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:58,230
talking about a period of
his traveling and he says,

1312
01:22:58,680 --> 01:22:59,880
or I should say it reads,

1313
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:02,640
he stopped along the way to look
at several well known temples.

1314
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:05,650
And at each of them he bowed
and said two prayers. One was,

1315
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,950
please protect my sister from harm.
The other was,

1316
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:11,650
please test the lowly
Musashi with hardship.

1317
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:15,340
Let him become the greatest
swordsmen in the land or let him die.

1318
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:23,440
Please test the lowly Musashi with
hardship. That's what he's praying for.

1319
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,130
And that's what you'd think when you
were getting into the professional world.

1320
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,320
You're like, all right, bring
it because you were scared.

1321
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:30,180
You think you were scared
about what was gonna happen.

1322
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:36,380
I knew that I had relatively
high pain tolerance and uh,

1323
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:42,240
I could handle a lot of workload.
So I was,

1324
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:47,420
I was preparing myself for several years
of being lowest on the totem pole and

1325
01:23:48,031 --> 01:23:48,980
suffering.
Got It.

1326
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:53,990
But making up for our lack of experience
by just absorbing more punishment in

1327
01:23:56,161 --> 01:24:00,420
the form of just working longer
hours, work hard, doing more,

1328
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:04,050
always doing more. And uh,
served me well at the time.

1329
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:08,670
Got An idea for a book anyways,
I guess. Yeah, exactly.

1330
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:13,170
And then when I disintegrated in self
imploded, I had an idea for a book. Uh,

1331
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,740
yeah, there's a go. This
is another one. And uh,

1332
01:24:18,510 --> 01:24:20,700
it's referring to I believe

1333
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:26,890
Musashi's writing and it says, well, his
writing has a certain childish quality,

1334
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:30,550
but there's an appealing,
what can I say directness about it.

1335
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,420
If I had a swordsman in mind,
I would say it shows spiritual breadth.

1336
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:38,020
The boy may eventually be somebody.
I just liked that.

1337
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:40,930
The childish directness.
Yeah.

1338
01:24:41,970 --> 01:24:45,840
Yeah. The good stuff. And again, that's,

1339
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:47,940
that's what you were thinking
about yourself. Like, Hey,

1340
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,440
at that time you were the young swordsman
coming up in the business world.

1341
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:56,970
That's right. Having to
make things happen. Um,

1342
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:01,800
there's a,
there's another fight scene here.

1343
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:06,060
He called him fight scenes cause I
don't know, that sounds like a movie,

1344
01:25:06,090 --> 01:25:07,080
a Kung Fu movie.

1345
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:09,660
Not that there's anything wrong with
Kung Fu movies cause some Kung Fu movies

1346
01:25:09,661 --> 01:25:14,210
are awesome, but some of them
are also cheesy. Sure. Um,

1347
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,880
the, you're a movie professional
there. Echo Charles. Yeah.

1348
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:21,300
I don't think he'd be called the scene
if it's in a book. Okay. I Dunno.

1349
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:26,910
I Dunno. Is it not a scene if
it's in a book? It could be,

1350
01:25:26,911 --> 01:25:30,330
we could do this. It reads like a
screenplay. So if it were a screenplay,

1351
01:25:30,331 --> 01:25:33,570
we could call it a beat or
a scene. I think. Here's a,

1352
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:35,850
here's a scene after an inner,

1353
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:39,690
this is a fight with a guy named Dan Chin.
Shiro.

1354
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:45,090
After an interval of two or three breaths,
Denson Chiro shouted Musashi.

1355
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:48,720
He was well aware that the man standing
several feet above him was in a very

1356
01:25:48,721 --> 01:25:52,620
advantageous position. Not only was
he perfectly safe from the rear,

1357
01:25:52,740 --> 01:25:55,860
but anyone trying to attack him either
from the right or left would first have

1358
01:25:55,861 --> 01:25:57,240
to climb up to his level.

1359
01:25:57,570 --> 01:26:01,080
He was thus free to devote his entire
attention to the enemy before him.

1360
01:26:01,081 --> 01:26:04,010
So he's about to fight this guy. And
as you said earlier, sometimes he

1361
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:05,870
shows up late. Sometimes he
shows up early. In this case,

1362
01:26:05,871 --> 01:26:09,920
he showed up early and he got an elevated
position, and so his enemy, Daesh,

1363
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:14,330
Charo is sitting there looking,
going, oh, this sucks. I'm below him.

1364
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,880
And he's protected from the
back and left and right,

1365
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,700
and then Musashi says,
are you ready?

1366
01:26:23,330 --> 01:26:24,680
Musashi's question was calm,

1367
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:29,150
but trenchant falling like so
much ice water on his opponents.

1368
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:32,030
Feverish excitement.
Denson Searo.

1369
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,400
Now God has first good look at Musashi.

1370
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:38,240
So this is the bastard he
thought his hatred was total.

1371
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:40,340
He resented the maiming of his brother.

1372
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:45,520
He was vexed at being compared with
Masashi by the common people and he had an

1373
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:50,840
ingrained contempt for what he regarded
as a country upstart posing as a Samurai.

1374
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,090
Who are you to ask?
Are you ready?

1375
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:57,710
It is well past the hour of nine did I
say I'd be here exactly at nine don't

1376
01:26:57,711 --> 01:27:01,100
make excuses. I've been waiting
a long time. As you can see,

1377
01:27:01,101 --> 01:27:03,680
I'm fully prepared now
come down from there.

1378
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:09,050
He did not underestimate his opponent
in the extent of daring attack,

1379
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:12,350
daring to attack from his
present position in a minute,

1380
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,720
answered Musashi with a slight laugh.

1381
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:20,330
There was a difference between Musashi's
idea of preparation and his opponents.

1382
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:25,990
Denson Shiro though physically prepared
had only begun to pull himself together

1383
01:27:26,511 --> 01:27:27,470
spiritually,

1384
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:31,910
whereas Musashi had started fighting
long before he presented himself to his

1385
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:33,800
enemy.
For him,

1386
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:37,850
the battle was now entering
its second and central phase.

1387
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:40,570
At the Geelong Shrine.

1388
01:27:40,571 --> 01:27:44,210
He had seen the footprints in the
snow and at that moment is fighting.

1389
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:48,920
Instinct had been aroused knowing that
the shadow of the man following him was

1390
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:49,551
no longer there.

1391
01:27:49,551 --> 01:27:53,870
He had boldly entered the gate and
made a quick approach to the kitchen.

1392
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,210
Having waken the priest,

1393
01:27:56,211 --> 01:27:59,360
he struck up a conversation suddenly
questioning the man as to what had been

1394
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:02,720
going on earlier in the
evening edition sharp,

1395
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,240
disregarding the fact that
he was a little late. He had,

1396
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:08,300
he had had some tea and warmed himself up.

1397
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:12,410
Then when he made his appearance it was
abrupt and from relative safety of the

1398
01:28:12,411 --> 01:28:15,740
Veranda he had seized the initiative.

1399
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,230
So I guess I was wrong in this section.

1400
01:28:18,250 --> 01:28:21,530
He doesn't show up late but he or he
shows up late but he like gets to an

1401
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:25,130
advantageous position without the other
guy realizing it, which is just as cool.

1402
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:30,500
Did you find one? I've got so
many but this one, this one.

1403
01:28:30,530 --> 01:28:33,110
This one is good because it highlights

1404
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:39,080
how profound is maybe
too strong a word but a

1405
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:45,230
deep, some of the characters in
the book are besides Musashi,

1406
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:50,320
because there are quite a few characters
in here and this is a teacher.

1407
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:55,310
This is an exchange between
is as far as I can tell,

1408
01:28:55,370 --> 01:29:00,370
he's Imo and who's one of the teachers
or a PR prospective teacher and Musashi

1409
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,333
and Musashi

1410
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,360
has brought a letter that he
wants. He's, I'm wonder read,

1411
01:29:06,361 --> 01:29:11,361
which is some type of request
for instruction and cause
I'm on is ignoring both

1412
01:29:13,261 --> 01:29:17,160
Musashi and the letter and he says,
but just please read the letter.

1413
01:29:17,161 --> 01:29:19,140
I don't want to just
please read the letter. No,

1414
01:29:19,141 --> 01:29:22,740
I'm not going to read your letter. And
then it says, please read the letter.

1415
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:26,370
I don't need to. And then massage.
She says, what's the matter?

1416
01:29:26,371 --> 01:29:30,090
Can't you read cause I'm an snorted.
And then massage. She says, well,

1417
01:29:30,091 --> 01:29:33,330
if you can read, read
it. This is what he says.

1418
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:35,250
You're a tricky brat.

1419
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:38,550
The reason I said I don't need to read
it is that I already know what it says.

1420
01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:42,510
Musashi says even so,
wouldn't it be more polite to read it?

1421
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:44,100
And this is how the teacher responds.

1422
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,610
Student warriors swarm here
like mosquitoes and maggots.

1423
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:49,620
If I took time to be
polite to all of them,

1424
01:29:49,621 --> 01:29:53,220
I wouldn't be able to do anything else.
And that he continues.

1425
01:29:53,221 --> 01:29:56,760
I feel sorry for you. However. So I'll
tell you what the letter says. All right,

1426
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:01,950
this piece right here, ah, it's just good.

1427
01:30:01,951 --> 01:30:05,010
This is the continuation
of that fight scene,

1428
01:30:05,011 --> 01:30:07,140
which actually goes on for multiple pages.

1429
01:30:08,740 --> 01:30:12,070
His technique is better than mine.
Musashi thought candidly,

1430
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,590
he had the same feeling
of inferiority at Cole.

1431
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:21,310
You Guy who castle when he had been
encircled by four leading swordsmen of the

1432
01:30:21,311 --> 01:30:22,390
Yazoo school.

1433
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:26,830
It was always this way when he faced
towards men of the north of the Orthodox

1434
01:30:26,831 --> 01:30:30,760
schools for his own technique
was without form or reason,

1435
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:36,060
nothing more really than a do or die
method staring at dead Chinchero.

1436
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:42,120
He saw that the style Yoshi was you
Kempo had created and spent his life,

1437
01:30:44,290 --> 01:30:47,890
had both simply simplicity and complexity.

1438
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:53,040
Complexity was well ordered and systematic
and was not to be overcome by brute

1439
01:30:53,111 --> 01:30:54,550
strength or spirit alone.

1440
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:58,450
Musashi was cautious about
making any unnecessary movements,

1441
01:30:58,451 --> 01:31:03,370
has primitive tactics or refuse to come
into play to an extent that surprised

1442
01:31:03,371 --> 01:31:06,400
him.
His arms rebelled against being extended.

1443
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,000
The best he could do is maintain a
conservative defensive stance and wait.

1444
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:15,040
His eyes grew red searching for an
opening. He prayed to hace man for victory

1445
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:21,390
and then they go through and it's just
dead silence. Snow accumulated on Musashi,

1446
01:31:21,391 --> 01:31:25,610
his hair, and then he kind
of breaks him down mentally,

1447
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:26,793
um,

1448
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:32,060
destined charros feet inched
forward at the tip of his sword.

1449
01:31:32,061 --> 01:31:37,061
His willpower quivered toward the start
of a movement to lives expired with two

1450
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:41,750
strokes of a single sword first.
And we saw she attacked who his rear.

1451
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,340
So a guy had snuck up behind him,

1452
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,760
Musashi kills that guy and then
kills it's just another, um,

1453
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:49,460
another great battle scene.

1454
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:55,210
And the, uh, the eyes, they talk about
the eyes quite a bit in this book.

1455
01:31:55,690 --> 01:31:58,870
And I'll come back to Kendo where you,

1456
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:03,280
something that's very uncommon in
Japanese culture, which is really intense.

1457
01:32:03,281 --> 01:32:07,330
Direct eye contact doesn't happen
a whole lot in Japanese culture.

1458
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,010
Even in the martial arts.
In judo it's more of a relaxed gaze.

1459
01:32:12,011 --> 01:32:15,040
And you might come out first
and there's some yelling.

1460
01:32:15,070 --> 01:32:17,680
So you'll hear that quite a bit.
I don't know if non Japanese do it,

1461
01:32:17,681 --> 01:32:22,681
but in Japan when I was watching certain
people compete or competing myself and

1462
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:27,790
you'd hear people and they come out and
after they bough they'll let out a bit

1463
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:30,490
of a scream. But then it's,
then it's down to business.

1464
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:35,610
And in Kendo you hear a
lot more vocalization and
really intense eye contact.

1465
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:41,020
Are you trained to look at their
eyes? Yeah. Okay. So would you,

1466
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:46,030
where do you look in wrestling?
In wrestling, and I should say,

1467
01:32:46,031 --> 01:32:48,310
I mean I was,
I was a decent high school restaurant,

1468
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:50,300
had a good competitive record, but, uh,

1469
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:53,080
I wouldn't consider myself
anywhere like a d one restaurant,

1470
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:57,730
just mop the floor with me.
Uh, but I would typically
have kind of more of a soft,

1471
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:01,030
uh,
I can hips type of,

1472
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:03,730
I mean I'm always looking at
people's chest in every sport.

1473
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:07,990
I'm looking kind of like naval and chest,
usually kind of watch it in the hips,

1474
01:33:08,320 --> 01:33:12,970
in wrestling. But in Kempo they teach
you to look at the eyes in Kendo.

1475
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:16,090
Kendo, they teach you to look at the
eyes and are you looking for like,

1476
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:19,540
to see what they're going to do? That's
where you're going to see their movement.

1477
01:33:19,870 --> 01:33:22,540
You know, there isn't any
explicit instruction and why,

1478
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,620
but you communicate a
lot with your eyes and a,

1479
01:33:26,621 --> 01:33:28,750
so you can tell if someone's intimidated.

1480
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:33,570
You can tell if someone's
angry, you can tell. Uh,

1481
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:36,160
you can also throw people off.
So for instance,

1482
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:39,910
I mean you have Mendel Colt Day and all
this stuff. You have the targets, right?

1483
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,370
And what I realized pretty
quickly is that much like in say,

1484
01:33:45,371 --> 01:33:49,390
boy ty on Thai kickboxing,
one of the oldest tricks in
the book, which is really,

1485
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:51,730
really unpleasant if you
happen to get caught with it,

1486
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:57,630
is particularly since I ball up to say I
got caught with it when I went to Japan

1487
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,910
because I want it to also
cross train in striking.

1488
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:05,500
And so I went to a number of schools
including place called [inaudible] and

1489
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:09,520
kindness is, it's at the end of it like
Coldwell [inaudible], this, this con,

1490
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:13,720
whatever it is, that sort of
place of practice, right? And,

1491
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:17,270
uh,
first time I sparred someone in the,

1492
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,550
in the karate schools in Japan,
like Gilchrist g and, and so on,

1493
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:24,690
they don't have head contact with
the fists, but it's bare fisted.

1494
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:27,160
So you're punching each other
in the chest and body and so on.

1495
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:32,410
And this guy was wailing on my legs.
He was just like hitting me with these,

1496
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:33,280
these,
uh,

1497
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:37,510
roundhouse kicks to the legs and I
had never even seen like kicks before.

1498
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:41,350
So I was punching him right in the chest,
just below his collarbone,

1499
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:43,330
right his throat.

1500
01:34:43,331 --> 01:34:45,490
And then punching him in the stomach
and he was kicking me in the legs.

1501
01:34:45,491 --> 01:34:49,460
I was like, hey bro, like I'll do this
all day long. And so punching the Jasmine,

1502
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:52,750
I had to skip school the next
day cause I couldn't walk.

1503
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:57,890
But the trick in Moy Tai that you see a
lot is like, look at the leg low kick,

1504
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:00,620
look at the leg, low kick, look at
the leg, low kick, look at the leg,

1505
01:35:00,621 --> 01:35:04,280
low kick and still it until it really
starts to hook hurt and then look at the

1506
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:08,030
leg head kick. And you see a lot
of people get knocked out that way.

1507
01:35:08,031 --> 01:35:13,031
So when Ken know you can do something
very similar where you're sort of

1508
01:35:13,461 --> 01:35:16,790
telegraphing deliberately with your
eyes and going for a certain target,

1509
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:20,660
you get parried you do that four or five
times and then you telegraph the same

1510
01:35:20,661 --> 01:35:25,370
way and go for a different target. Yeah.
Uh, but yeah, the eye contact is, was,

1511
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,340
it's really, it's really
intense. And if you watch,

1512
01:35:28,341 --> 01:35:33,341
Kendall won't say youtube and
imagine what the eye contact is like.

1513
01:35:33,530 --> 01:35:36,230
If their eyes are like wide
open staring at each other,

1514
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:41,470
it adds another layer of flavor
to the entire experience.

1515
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:46,330
And then you can read a passage like this
and you're like, Oh God, I can see it.

1516
01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:50,090
And it's opposite of Jujitsu where you
don't really look at the person. Yeah.

1517
01:35:50,570 --> 01:35:54,320
It's almost like the little unwritten
rule. Like don't know why contract. Yeah.

1518
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:01,080
Those gazing lovingly into someone's
eyes like purposefully when I'm trying to

1519
01:36:01,341 --> 01:36:03,080
really mess with someone,
you know,

1520
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:07,280
I just look right at him like
and shake my head very suddenly.

1521
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:14,900
And you probably noticed that they never
really look at you unless you do it

1522
01:36:14,901 --> 01:36:15,800
super deliberately.

1523
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,870
Like if you try to roll with
someone when you were with someone,

1524
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:21,920
try like notice where they're looking.
It's almost like they're just blank.

1525
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:24,930
The blank. Yeah. Just,

1526
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,000
I mean that's a weird thing too is with
Jujitsu you don't even have to use your

1527
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:32,000
eyes. Like I used to notice, I
don't notice it so much anymore.

1528
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:33,890
I used to notice if someone
was in a good position on me,

1529
01:36:33,891 --> 01:36:37,550
I would actually close my eyes. I started
viewing it like I was not, it was,

1530
01:36:37,551 --> 01:36:40,280
it wasn't smart like I was
doing it to relax myself.

1531
01:36:40,730 --> 01:36:42,960
Someone gets in a good position.
I just close my eyes cause you,

1532
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,950
you know where they are.
They're freaking, you know,

1533
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,200
on your back or they're across the side,
you know exactly where they are.

1534
01:36:48,200 --> 01:36:49,700
But I would just close
my eyes to kind of relax.

1535
01:36:49,701 --> 01:36:52,130
I don't do it anymore cause it
seems like a bad idea. Right.

1536
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:55,970
Why would you close your eyes? Stupid.
It burns a lot of energy though.

1537
01:36:55,971 --> 01:37:00,971
I remember doing training with Laird
Hamilton who's one of the most famous big

1538
01:37:01,671 --> 01:37:05,870
wave surfers of all time. If anyone
hasn't seen the documentary riding giants.

1539
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,830
Oh my God. Yeah. Go see that.
The invention of tow in surfing,

1540
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:14,180
holy God.
And he leered is a beast.

1541
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:17,180
I mean he's one of the most incredible
physical specimens I've ever seen.

1542
01:37:17,181 --> 01:37:21,620
He's in his fifties and just wipes the
floor with like first round draft picks

1543
01:37:21,621 --> 01:37:23,900
routinely, uh, in terms of workouts.

1544
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:28,010
And he likes to do a lot of
underwater training with weights.

1545
01:37:28,970 --> 01:37:32,210
And he's devised all of
these original exercises,

1546
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:36,160
like there's one called ammo
boxes where you hold a Dumbbell,

1547
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:41,170
he holds a 50 pound dumbbell to his chest
and then swims across the surface of

1548
01:37:41,421 --> 01:37:45,410
the pool or just slightly
submerged with one arm. Uh,

1549
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:50,230
and then does all manner of
different exercises. And his
wife, Gabby, Gabby Reece,

1550
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:54,140
who is also a world class athlete
of her own right, said to me,

1551
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:56,370
relax your eyes because under water,

1552
01:37:56,371 --> 01:37:59,640
when I'm holding like two 50
pound dumbbells, understandably,

1553
01:37:59,641 --> 01:38:01,260
my eyes are bugging out
of my head and she's like,

1554
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:02,760
you're burning too much energy.
She's like,

1555
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:06,990
try relaxing your eyes and I could
hold my breath for another 10,

1556
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:11,700
15 seconds just by relaxing
my eyes. Uh, and just,

1557
01:38:11,701 --> 01:38:16,470
just another side note that's related
and I think relates to a lot in this book

1558
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:20,940
also, not just Jujitsu
is in, uh, in tango.

1559
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:25,430
I'm making it a point to bring up tango
every time we talk publicly about cool,

1560
01:38:26,620 --> 01:38:31,620
let's be the best female dancers very
frequently close their eyes because if

1561
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:39,540
they try to read the males movement in
order to respond, it's already too late.

1562
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:41,790
If they tried to do it visually,
it's too late.

1563
01:38:42,090 --> 01:38:44,880
And I think that with
a lot of martial arts,

1564
01:38:44,881 --> 01:38:48,240
certainly that in
particular with grappling,

1565
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:51,780
I mean your body is always going to sense
it before your eyes can interpret it.

1566
01:38:51,860 --> 01:38:56,050
And that's why I was doing it originally.
Yeah. Much like the female tangle.

1567
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:02,010
I remember Greg had a drill where you'd
start back to back and said, okay,

1568
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:02,671
you've got to close your eyes.

1569
01:39:02,671 --> 01:39:05,280
Just kind of trust you gotta
close your eyes and then grapple.

1570
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,490
And I remember doing it and think,
oh, that's not that much harder.

1571
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,040
It's like as long as you're
already connected with the guy,

1572
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,420
it's not that much harder.

1573
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:13,633
Yeah.

1574
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:19,130
So speaking of tango dancing and women,

1575
01:39:21,470 --> 01:39:24,410
here's, uh, he, he again,

1576
01:39:24,710 --> 01:39:28,940
Ohsu is in and out of the book and at
this point he is heading to a battle and

1577
01:39:28,941 --> 01:39:30,020
the odds are against him.

1578
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:34,640
And Ot wants to go in with him and
she actually wants to die if he dies,

1579
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:38,330
and so he's having a conversation
with her and here we go.

1580
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:42,980
Don't be a fool oh two he
suddenly blurted. There's no
reason why you should die.

1581
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:47,720
The strength in his own
voice and the depth of his
feeling surprised to even him.

1582
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:50,840
He's one thing from you to die
fighting against the Yoshi.

1583
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:55,760
This not only is it right for a man who
lives by the sword, die by the sword.

1584
01:39:56,150 --> 01:40:01,150
I have a duty to remind those cowards of
the way of the Samurai your willingness

1585
01:40:01,581 --> 01:40:05,030
to follow me to death as deeply touching,
but what good would it do?

1586
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:09,200
No more than the pitiful
death of an insect.

1587
01:40:10,580 --> 01:40:14,690
Seeing her burst into tears,
he regretted the brutality of his words.

1588
01:40:15,980 --> 01:40:20,930
Now I understand how over the years I've
lied to you and I've lied to myself.

1589
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:24,380
I didn't intend to deceive you
when we ran away from the bridge,

1590
01:40:24,440 --> 01:40:27,470
from the village or when I
saw you at Hunada bridge,

1591
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:30,230
but I did by pretending to
be cold and indifferent.

1592
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:35,840
That wasn't the way I really felt.
In a little while, I'll be dead.

1593
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:40,130
What I'm trying, what I'm about to
say is the truth. I love you. Oh Tzu.

1594
01:40:40,430 --> 01:40:44,120
I throw everything to the four
winds and live out my life with you.

1595
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:49,310
If only after a moment's pause,
he continued in a more forceful vein.

1596
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:53,320
You must believe every word I say because
I'll never have another chance to you.

1597
01:40:53,321 --> 01:40:56,680
This I speak with neither
pride nor pretense.

1598
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:00,520
There have been days when I couldn't
concentrate for thinking about you nights.

1599
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:03,850
I couldn't sleep for dreaming
of you. Hot, passionate dreams,

1600
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:08,710
Otu dreams that nearly drove me
mad often have hugged my palate,

1601
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:12,730
pretending it was you.
But even when I felt like that,

1602
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:15,400
if I took out my sword and looked at it,

1603
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:19,060
the madness evaporated
and my blood cooled.

1604
01:41:20,170 --> 01:41:24,160
Her face turned toward him. Tearful
boat as radiant as the morning glory.

1605
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:27,850
She started to speak,
seeing the fervor in his eyes,

1606
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:31,870
her words caught in her throat and
she looked again at the ground.

1607
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:34,000
The sword is my refuge.

1608
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:37,360
Anytime my passion
threatens to overcome me,

1609
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:42,340
I forced myself back into the world of
swordsman ship. This is my fate. Ohsu.

1610
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,610
I'm torn between love and self discipline.

1611
01:41:46,120 --> 01:41:50,380
I seem to be traveling on two paths
at once. Yet when the past diverge,

1612
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:53,740
I invariably managed to keep
myself on the right one.

1613
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:59,140
I know myself better than anyone does.
I'm neither a genius nor great man.

1614
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:04,810
He became silent again despite his
desires to express his feelings. Honestly,

1615
01:42:04,930 --> 01:42:07,810
his word seem to be concealing the truth.

1616
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:13,390
His heart told him to be even more candid.
That's the kind of man I am.

1617
01:42:13,450 --> 01:42:14,650
What else can I say?

1618
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:19,780
I think of my sword and you disappear
into some dark corner of my mind.

1619
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,870
No disappear altogether.

1620
01:42:22,930 --> 01:42:26,860
Leaving no trace at times like that.

1621
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:29,710
I'm happiest and most
satisfied with my life.

1622
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:33,070
Do you understand all
this time you've suffered,

1623
01:42:33,190 --> 01:42:36,430
you've risked your body and soul and
a man who loves his sword more than he

1624
01:42:36,431 --> 01:42:40,060
loves you.
I'll die to vindicate my sword,

1625
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:42,310
but I wouldn't die for
the love of a woman.

1626
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Not even you as so much as I'd like to
fall on my knees and begged forgiveness.

1627
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:49,983
I can't.

1628
01:42:55,030 --> 01:42:57,090
Yeah.
Another speech.

1629
01:42:57,170 --> 01:43:01,280
You another scene that most women
would rather not go through. Yeah.

1630
01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:03,900
And it's another, I, again,

1631
01:43:03,930 --> 01:43:08,340
I know I don't relate to every normal
person at all in very little ways,

1632
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:11,940
but like when I read that, I'm always
like, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

1633
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:16,410
And I've been married for 20 years to
an awesome woman. And uh, but yeah,

1634
01:43:16,411 --> 01:43:20,850
when I hear that, I just think, yeah,
that's how you do it, right? Hey, look,

1635
01:43:21,330 --> 01:43:25,560
every time I would start thinking about
you, I just look at my rifle and be good.

1636
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:27,810
I want us, I want to, I want
to chime in and get something,

1637
01:43:27,811 --> 01:43:32,790
another one that is not chronologically,
yeah, sorry. We're out. We're out of sync.

1638
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:37,800
Oh, it's okay. But the ones that I
underline tend to be universally,

1639
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:42,570
I think universally applicable in
some ways. Yeah. So to the four,

1640
01:43:42,571 --> 01:43:47,571
this is a apparently a discussion about
some type of battle and they're going

1641
01:43:49,201 --> 01:43:52,640
back and forth.
Uh,

1642
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:59,410
all right, so this is Musashi then.
What else can I do? But challenge him?

1643
01:43:59,411 --> 01:44:01,270
I realize of course that even if I do,

1644
01:44:01,271 --> 01:44:03,370
he'll probably refuse to
come out of retirement.

1645
01:44:03,371 --> 01:44:06,250
So I'm challenging this whole
castle to a battle instead.

1646
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:10,930
A battle of course, the four. Uh,

1647
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:13,540
and then here we go.
So his,

1648
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:16,930
his arms still held by cause
Eiman and Deb Uchi and massage.

1649
01:44:16,931 --> 01:44:18,040
She looked up at the sky,

1650
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:21,580
there was a flapping sound cause an eagle
flew towards them from the blackness

1651
01:44:21,581 --> 01:44:24,970
enveloping Malka soggy,
like a giant shroud.

1652
01:44:24,971 --> 01:44:28,960
It's silhouette hid the stars from view
before it glided noisily down to the

1653
01:44:28,961 --> 01:44:30,370
roof of the rice store house.

1654
01:44:30,371 --> 01:44:34,090
And then this is the part that I
highlighted to the fore retainers.

1655
01:44:34,091 --> 01:44:38,050
The word battle sounded so
melodramatic as to be laughable,

1656
01:44:38,260 --> 01:44:42,810
but to Musashi at barely suffice to
express his concept of what was to come.

1657
01:44:45,710 --> 01:44:50,600
Yes, yes. This part. So,

1658
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:53,590
so Musashi's it had this,
another clan,

1659
01:44:53,591 --> 01:44:58,591
another group that he's
been battling with and the,

1660
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:04,170
the senior guy in the family,
the senior guy from the school died or is,

1661
01:45:04,660 --> 01:45:09,280
yeah, he's died. And this 13 year old
boy is now the senior guy in the family.

1662
01:45:09,281 --> 01:45:14,140
His name is again judo
and he shows up.

1663
01:45:14,141 --> 01:45:15,400
So he's challenges of,
again,

1664
01:45:15,401 --> 01:45:19,540
he challenges all these people to a fight
and he shows up and they show up and

1665
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:21,370
he gets there.
It's by some tree

1666
01:45:23,110 --> 01:45:27,070
and of course it starts off Musashi.
You're late. Cried a horse first. Pride,

1667
01:45:27,071 --> 01:45:29,350
a hoarse voice.
You took a shit on my dinner table.

1668
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,940
Many took encouragement from Musashi's
declue declaration that he was alone

1669
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:39,580
believing it was a trick. They started
looking around for Phantom seconds,

1670
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,600
allowed twisting off to one side.
Allowed was followed.

1671
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:48,250
A split second later by the glint of
Musashi sword flashing through the air.

1672
01:45:49,330 --> 01:45:50,540
Oh,
someone had shot an arrow.

1673
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:54,910
The Arrow aimed at his face broke
half falling behind his shoulder.

1674
01:45:54,911 --> 01:45:59,740
The other half, the other half
near the tip of his lowered sword,

1675
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:04,670
or rather where his sword
had just been from Musashi,

1676
01:46:04,690 --> 01:46:08,440
was already on the move.
His hair bristling like a lion's mane.

1677
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:13,560
He was bounding toward the shadowy form
behind the spreading pine getting Jiro

1678
01:46:15,490 --> 01:46:19,570
hugged the tree trunk.
Screaming help. I'm scared.

1679
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:24,940
Ghazi Moan jumped forward. A howling
is though the blow had struck him,

1680
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:26,050
but it was too late.

1681
01:46:26,620 --> 01:46:31,060
Musashi sword slice to two foot
strip of bark off the trunk.

1682
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:36,190
It fell to the ground by can gyros,
blood covered head.

1683
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:42,150
It was the act of a ferocious demon
Musashi ignoring the others had made

1684
01:46:42,701 --> 01:46:47,701
straight for the boy and it seemed
he had had this in mind from the,

1685
01:46:50,660 --> 01:46:53,990
the assault was of a
savagery beyond conception.

1686
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:59,440
Can Gyros death did not reduce the Yoshi
goes Yoshi oak is fighting capacity in

1687
01:46:59,571 --> 01:47:01,880
the slightest would had been nervous.

1688
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:05,270
Excitement rose to a level
of murderer's frenzy.

1689
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:09,080
And so that's how he kicks off the battle.

1690
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:12,980
There's the 13 year old boy and he goes
right for him and cuts off his head.

1691
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:20,090
So, um, and this is the
first time he starts using,

1692
01:47:20,350 --> 01:47:21,440
uh,
both sorts.

1693
01:47:21,441 --> 01:47:24,620
I think this is the first time onlookers
who had a clear view of him covered

1694
01:47:24,621 --> 01:47:27,200
their eyes and horror. This
is, as this battle continues,

1695
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:32,060
most more ghastly still was the site of
the dead and wounded left in his wake.

1696
01:47:32,180 --> 01:47:34,610
As he continued his tactical
retreat up the path,

1697
01:47:34,790 --> 01:47:38,480
he reached a patch of open land where
his pursuers surged forward in a mass

1698
01:47:38,481 --> 01:47:42,740
attack. In a matter of seconds, four
or five of men had been cut down.

1699
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:44,780
They lay scattered over a wide area,

1700
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:48,710
more urban testimony to the speed with
which Musashi struck and moved on.

1701
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:50,990
He seemed to be everywhere at once,

1702
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:55,910
but for all is agile shifts and Dodgers
Musashi clung to one basic strategy.

1703
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,870
He never attacked a group from
the front or the side always.

1704
01:47:59,871 --> 01:48:04,871
Oh bleakly add an exposed corner whenever
a battery of Samurai approached him

1705
01:48:04,881 --> 01:48:05,510
head on,

1706
01:48:05,510 --> 01:48:09,740
he somehow contrived to shift like
lightening to a corner of their formation

1707
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:13,550
from which he could confront only
one or two of them at a time.

1708
01:48:14,060 --> 01:48:17,750
In this way, he managed to keep them
essentially in the same position,

1709
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:23,090
but eventually Musashi was bound to be
worn down eventually to his opponents

1710
01:48:23,091 --> 01:48:26,630
seemed to be, seemed bound to find a
way to thwart his method of attack.

1711
01:48:26,810 --> 01:48:27,643
To do this,

1712
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:32,360
they would need to form themselves into
two large forces before and behind him.

1713
01:48:33,020 --> 01:48:35,930
Then he would be in the
in even greater danger.

1714
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:37,320
Okay.

1715
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:42,320
It took them all Musashi's resourcefulness
to stop that from happening at some

1716
01:48:42,391 --> 01:48:43,710
point.
Musashi Jew,

1717
01:48:43,740 --> 01:48:48,390
his smaller sword and started a fight
with both hands while the large sword in

1718
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:52,260
his right hand was smeared with blood
up to the hilt and the fist that held at

1719
01:48:52,261 --> 01:48:56,640
the small sword in his left hand was
clean and though it picked up a bit of

1720
01:48:56,641 --> 01:49:01,410
flesh the first time it was used,
it continued to sparkle greedy for blood.

1721
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:05,820
Musashi himself was not fully aware
that he had drawn it even though he was

1722
01:49:05,821 --> 01:49:09,660
wielding it with the same
deafness as the larger sword.

1723
01:49:11,190 --> 01:49:15,900
So he's just getting after it with two
swords, you're going to eventually run.

1724
01:49:15,901 --> 01:49:20,670
Crowd cried a thousand voices,
you fighting by herself.
Ron Run while you can,

1725
01:49:20,850 --> 01:49:22,500
so he just crushes everyone.

1726
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:29,040
There's another weapon that I don't know
if they talk about this book that he

1727
01:49:29,130 --> 01:49:31,530
was quite adept at using
as I understand it,

1728
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:36,531
before he began fighting with two swords
and it goes by number of different

1729
01:49:37,741 --> 01:49:42,660
names in English. Sometimes it's
called the juts or a jetty. J U, t,

1730
01:49:42,661 --> 01:49:47,530
t, e in Japanese. It's the
Damian's 10 hands literally.

1731
01:49:48,580 --> 01:49:52,930
And it was a baton basically,

1732
01:49:52,931 --> 01:49:57,610
if you could imagine,
this will make sense in a moment.

1733
01:49:57,640 --> 01:50:02,640
If you could imagine a half inch thick
iron rod that's about 18 inches long or

1734
01:50:04,301 --> 01:50:05,230
12 inches long,

1735
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:10,760
that then has what looks like
the clip of a say ballpoint pen.

1736
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:13,450
Uh,
that is a little,

1737
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:17,950
that is pulled away from that,
uh,

1738
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:23,190
rod so that you have a space in between
this hook effectively and the rod palace

1739
01:50:25,961 --> 01:50:30,961
guards and so on would use these as the
equivalent of a police badge because

1740
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:35,920
they were forbidden from having swords
in certain quarters because they could be

1741
01:50:35,921 --> 01:50:39,190
used to assassinate higher
ranking officials and so on.

1742
01:50:40,780 --> 01:50:45,780
And you could use that in
combination with a sword to,

1743
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:47,053
uh,

1744
01:50:47,770 --> 01:50:52,770
effectively Perry or catch the bleed in
between those two prongs and then toss

1745
01:50:53,900 --> 01:50:58,150
it away or a twisted away or just use
it to temporarily arrest to the use of

1746
01:50:58,151 --> 01:51:02,050
that bleed and then pull your own
long sword and cut someone down.

1747
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:05,950
And we saw she was very
adept as I understand it,

1748
01:51:05,951 --> 01:51:08,770
at using the day before he
started using two sorts.

1749
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:12,820
You could also just use,
it just didn't like clubs.

1750
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:18,230
It's a big, which I'm sure this
is exactly what it was used for.

1751
01:51:18,860 --> 01:51:21,830
Now, as the story progresses, you know,

1752
01:51:21,831 --> 01:51:26,831
he matures and and starts moving into a
little bit of a different phase and this

1753
01:51:26,871 --> 01:51:29,030
is kind of where the first time he starts,
he's,

1754
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:33,620
he's wounded and he's traveling and
eventually he lays up for the night

1755
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:36,290
after they had said good night.

1756
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:38,660
Musashi went to his room where
he lay awake in the dark,

1757
01:51:38,661 --> 01:51:41,240
his eyes glistening
the way of the Samurai.

1758
01:51:41,660 --> 01:51:45,770
He concentrated on this concept as it
applied to himself and to his sword.

1759
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:50,000
Suddenly he saw the truth,
the techniques of a swordsman.

1760
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:54,890
We're not his goal. He sought the
all embracing way of the sword.

1761
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:58,760
The sword was to be far
more than a simple weapon.

1762
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:02,360
It had to be an answer
to life's questions.

1763
01:52:03,560 --> 01:52:05,210
The way of [inaudible],

1764
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:10,220
Kenshin and dot j months master Nami
was too narrowly military to hidebound.

1765
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:16,940
It would be up to him to add to it.

1766
01:52:17,150 --> 01:52:21,320
It's human aspect to give
it greater profundity,

1767
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:26,500
greater loftiness for the first time
he asked whether it was possible for an

1768
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:31,190
insignificant human to
become one with the universe.

1769
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,490
So he's starting to uh,

1770
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:38,580
like I said maturity.
Do you got one? Yeah,

1771
01:52:38,581 --> 01:52:43,581
I have one which I think is
philosophically very similar
and brings back one of

1772
01:52:43,801 --> 01:52:47,480
the characters that you
will about earlier. Uh,

1773
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:52,850
and uh, refers to a lesson that he
learns from head learned from Taco on.

1774
01:52:53,480 --> 01:52:56,090
And here's how it goes.
It wasn't that he,

1775
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:59,210
that's Misashi had forgotten the
lesson talk one had taught him.

1776
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:03,560
The truly in that is the truly
brave man is one who loves life,

1777
01:53:03,590 --> 01:53:07,580
cherishing it as a treasure that once
forfeited can never be recovered.

1778
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:12,470
He will knew that to live was
more than to merely survive.

1779
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,670
That's the one that I highlighted.

1780
01:53:14,690 --> 01:53:18,740
The problem was how to imbue this life
with meaning, have to ensure that he,

1781
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:23,690
that his day would cast a bright ray of
light into the future even if it became

1782
01:53:23,691 --> 01:53:28,430
necessary to give up that
life for a cause. If see if
he succeeded in doing this,

1783
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:32,480
the length of his life,
20 years or 70 made a little difference.

1784
01:53:32,570 --> 01:53:36,890
A lifetime was only an insignificant
interval in the endless flow of time.

1785
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:43,070
I think I've heard you say that quote
before like I'm to just surviving.

1786
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:46,760
Living is not just surviving. That's kind
of wild and maybe this is where I got,

1787
01:53:46,761 --> 01:53:48,650
maybe this is what I think
I've heard you say the quote,

1788
01:53:48,651 --> 01:53:52,220
but I think I've heard you say that
concept before. Yeah, I have and maybe,

1789
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:55,220
I mean this is where it incepted me
20 years ago. It was in massaging.

1790
01:53:57,230 --> 01:54:02,230
He ends up with a guy named EERE who sort
of a student of his and they're living

1791
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:06,410
in the mountains and again,
I think this is, this is as,

1792
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:09,021
as they,

1793
01:54:09,021 --> 01:54:13,580
as he's starting to mature and grow in
this area where he's going to where he is.

1794
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:17,930
It's a mountainous area in Japan and for
those of you that haven't been in Japan,

1795
01:54:17,931 --> 01:54:22,070
it's got some incredibly beautiful,
beautiful mountains and incredible, yeah,

1796
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:24,010
beautiful.
Even right outside

1797
01:54:24,010 --> 01:54:27,450
of Tokyo for people who are
ever thinking of going, ah,

1798
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:31,550
there's a place called [inaudible] goal,
which is n I k k o and the o is long,

1799
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:35,830
but Nico and they have
beautiful temples and mountains.

1800
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:39,190
That is where I did the Japanese
horseback archery. Just as a,

1801
01:54:39,191 --> 01:54:42,880
as a side note on the Japanese horseback
archery. It was so great. So there are,

1802
01:54:42,881 --> 01:54:46,090
there are not, as you would imagine
in many schools for horseback archery,

1803
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:51,070
but one of the s, one of the families,
one of the clans that still exists,

1804
01:54:51,100 --> 01:54:54,250
the Ogasawara.
So the Ogasawara as the family and then,

1805
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:57,340
or do like Yeu is the school.
And that,

1806
01:54:57,341 --> 01:55:01,780
that do you comes up a lot in Musashi's
life. If you look at the history,

1807
01:55:01,781 --> 01:55:03,940
it's like such and such,
do such and such.

1808
01:55:04,330 --> 01:55:09,050
Do you like the school of
whatever and Ogasawara or do you,

1809
01:55:09,370 --> 01:55:09,580
uh,

1810
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:14,580
Japanese horseback archery is what I
ended up studying with one of the members

1811
01:55:15,491 --> 01:55:18,180
of the Oga.
So out of family and we did it in Nico,

1812
01:55:18,190 --> 01:55:23,080
which a stunning place to train.
And, uh, just as a little,

1813
01:55:23,081 --> 01:55:26,720
a little, a little bit of context
on what exactly this means.

1814
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:31,760
So the ceremonial version of Japanese
horseback archery entails a straight away

1815
01:55:35,410 --> 01:55:37,510
that is marked off in,
in the,

1816
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:41,290
in my case with a metal rods like rebar.

1817
01:55:42,190 --> 01:55:46,590
So you effectively have these stakes
in the ground that are about three feet

1818
01:55:46,591 --> 01:55:50,880
high of rebar and like every five feet,
two parallel lines running,

1819
01:55:51,030 --> 01:55:52,860
let's call it 300 or 500 feet.

1820
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:57,940
And you get on a horse at the very
beginning of this track in there,

1821
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,510
three targets laid out,
uh,

1822
01:56:00,700 --> 01:56:04,130
equally distance over that 500 foot space.
Uh,

1823
01:56:04,230 --> 01:56:08,490
the first one probably comes up at about
a hundred meters and they're about the

1824
01:56:08,491 --> 01:56:12,810
size of a big dinner plate
and you're on the horse.

1825
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:16,350
The saddle is wood, so you
don't sit on it. A, you do,

1826
01:56:16,380 --> 01:56:20,850
you squat above it and you have Tabi
on which of these splits socks and you

1827
01:56:20,851 --> 01:56:23,580
don't have shoes on in these,
uh,

1828
01:56:23,790 --> 01:56:28,140
stirrups that actually do not
enclose the foot, uh, around.

1829
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:29,810
They didn't circle the foot.
They,

1830
01:56:29,811 --> 01:56:34,811
you stick it in kind of like a slipper
and you have a really wide stance.

1831
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:40,050
And then you have a bow,
which is about six feet long,
in my case, in my left hand.

1832
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:43,080
And the bottom of the bow,

1833
01:56:43,081 --> 01:56:47,400
you keep inside your thigh and then you
have arrows that are stuck into your

1834
01:56:47,401 --> 01:56:51,240
belt on your lower back and
your first Arrow is knocked.

1835
01:56:51,300 --> 01:56:56,300
And then you pull the line slightly and
lock it down with your index fingers so

1836
01:56:57,091 --> 01:57:01,180
that there's tension on him.
And then you have the reins and you,

1837
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:05,660
you take off at a full gallop and then
you throw the rains down and you fly with

1838
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,330
you gallop with no control.

1839
01:57:08,350 --> 01:57:11,730
The horse and these rebar
that are set every five feet,

1840
01:57:11,760 --> 01:57:15,230
keep the horse galloping in a straight
direction and you fire the first hour of

1841
01:57:15,231 --> 01:57:15,871
the first target,

1842
01:57:15,871 --> 01:57:18,930
and then you have to reload your
Arrow by reaching to your back,

1843
01:57:18,931 --> 01:57:21,900
pulling their hair out. And
there's a really tech, technical,

1844
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,860
somewhat complicated way
of knocking the air very,

1845
01:57:25,861 --> 01:57:27,660
very quickly while you're riding a horse.

1846
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:32,960
And then you intend to hit
the next two targets. Uh,

1847
01:57:32,961 --> 01:57:33,840
while you're yelling,

1848
01:57:33,841 --> 01:57:36,390
there's certain things you're supposed
to yell as you shoot at your target.

1849
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:41,010
And Ah, it's, it's an incredible,

1850
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:45,540
incredible demonstration.
And they do this at the temples in Nico,

1851
01:57:45,750 --> 01:57:50,580
which to me is what comes to mind in
terms of imagery when we're talking about

1852
01:57:50,610 --> 01:57:54,210
his experience in these
mountainous regions. And A, yeah,

1853
01:57:54,660 --> 01:57:55,620
lesson number one,

1854
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:59,190
or you do not want to fall off and people
do fall off because if you fall off

1855
01:57:59,191 --> 01:58:01,890
your horse, you get trampled by
the horse and you hit the rebar.

1856
01:58:04,590 --> 01:58:08,700
Uh, but, uh, the reason I
brought this up is that,

1857
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:10,333
uh,

1858
01:58:10,770 --> 01:58:15,770
everyone has seen restaurants say that
say established 1946 established 1987

1859
01:58:17,610 --> 01:58:18,540
established whatever.

1860
01:58:18,690 --> 01:58:23,130
And The Sun Pretty Young
Guy in his mid thirties,

1861
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:24,200
really strong.

1862
01:58:24,210 --> 01:58:28,290
The bow I shot had maybe like
a 60 pound or 65 pound tension,

1863
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:32,070
which is surprisingly difficult for
people who have not done much archery to

1864
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:36,510
hold that at full extension
for a period of time. Uh,

1865
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:39,480
especially on a horse,
it's like 65 is,

1866
01:58:39,530 --> 01:58:44,170
is 70 pounds is quite legit
on a longbow or recurve bow.

1867
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:48,580
And he was pulling a bow that
was 120 pounds, like nothing.

1868
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:51,930
And his jacket,
he had what,

1869
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:57,040
what might look like a sort of a shiny
like 1980s like breakdancing jacket is

1870
01:58:59,441 --> 01:59:01,040
kind of what it looked like with like the,

1871
01:59:01,041 --> 01:59:05,060
the t like the elastic tube
portions on their wrists.

1872
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:10,140
And on the back it said Olga
Sawada Yob Oussama established 1157

1873
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:16,770
let's just like,
yeah this goes back away.

1874
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,580
Did you hit the targets at the very end?
I did. Yeah. You got them. Cause you know,

1875
01:59:21,581 --> 01:59:25,360
shooting from vehicles is really, really
hard. Shooting guns from vehicles.

1876
01:59:25,420 --> 01:59:26,710
I mean it's just hard.
I can't,

1877
01:59:26,730 --> 01:59:31,730
I can't even imagine trying to do about
Arrow horseback on a wooden saddles.

1878
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:34,570
Yeah, it's a, it's
definitely a different thing.

1879
01:59:35,050 --> 01:59:38,680
I was very surprised that I actually ended
up hitting the targets. But uh, yeah,

1880
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:40,480
at the very end.
How long did you train it for?

1881
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:47,220
Another thing I would not recommend a,
I crammed it into a week. I had a week,

1882
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:50,770
I have a week to train and you know
how to ride a horse before I had some

1883
01:59:50,771 --> 01:59:51,850
experience.
On a horse,

1884
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:57,240
but western and western
style for people don't know.

1885
01:59:57,820 --> 02:00:00,510
If you think Rodeo, uh,
where you're, you're,

1886
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:03,160
you're effectively seated in the saddle.

1887
02:00:03,250 --> 02:00:05,830
It's kind of like the Harley
Davidson of, of horse riding. Thanks.

1888
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:08,320
Your feet are out in front of you
or you hear your heels are dropped,

1889
02:00:08,321 --> 02:00:11,950
you don't post.
And uh,

1890
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:15,840
Japanese is somewhere between, it's, it's,

1891
02:00:15,900 --> 02:00:20,900
it's closer to English where you'd be a
more elevated and the position is very,

1892
02:00:22,781 --> 02:00:26,890
very different. You're, you're effectively
an, almost a sumo stance. Like you're,

1893
02:00:26,891 --> 02:00:31,780
you're very much abducted,
like your, your groin is very,

1894
02:00:31,781 --> 02:00:34,090
very open.
So I was extremely sore.

1895
02:00:34,091 --> 02:00:38,710
I felt like I was doing like suspended
squat practice for hours every day.

1896
02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:40,900
So after a few days of that,
uh,

1897
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,740
pretty uncomfortable and we'd lost three
days, I want to say to rain when we,

1898
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:46,540
we couldn't,

1899
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:50,890
it was too dangerous for the horses and
the humans to train doing anything in

1900
02:00:50,891 --> 02:00:55,060
those conditions. So we had about four,
I'd say four days of real training.

1901
02:00:56,470 --> 02:00:59,560
So speaking of rain there, up there, uh,

1902
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:04,890
Musashi and EERE are up there and
well here we go into the book.

1903
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:08,860
As autumn waned,
the insect voices faded into silence,

1904
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:12,760
leaves withered and fell Musashi and at
Yorie finished their cabin because they

1905
02:01:12,761 --> 02:01:16,060
built a cabin and address themselves to
the task of making the land ready for

1906
02:01:16,061 --> 02:01:19,390
planting.
One day while serving the land we saw,

1907
02:01:19,391 --> 02:01:22,690
she suddenly found himself thinking it
was like a diagram of the social unrest

1908
02:01:22,691 --> 02:01:26,260
that it lasted for a century after
the own in war. Such thoughts aside,

1909
02:01:26,470 --> 02:01:28,060
it was not an encouraging picture.

1910
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:32,930
Unknown to Musashi hot too hot Hotan go.

1911
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:35,410
Hodra had over the centuries,

1912
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:40,250
been buried many times by volcanic
ash from Mount Fuji and the tone river

1913
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:45,250
had repeatedly flooded the flatlands
whenever when the weather was fair and the

1914
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:48,890
land bone dry,
but whenever there was heavy rains,

1915
02:01:48,980 --> 02:01:53,980
the water carved out new channels
carrying great quantities of dirt and rock

1916
02:01:54,081 --> 02:01:54,914
along with it.

1917
02:01:55,100 --> 02:01:59,030
There was no principal stream into
which smaller ones flowed naturally.

1918
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:03,620
The nearest thing to this being a
wide base in that locks efficiently,

1919
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,760
sufficient capacity.

1920
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:09,790
Artists are lacked sufficient capacity
to either water or drain the area as a

1921
02:02:09,861 --> 02:02:14,090
whole. The most urgent need was obvious
to bring the water under control.

1922
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:17,390
So we've got this big piece
of land and he thinks, okay,

1923
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:18,350
I'm gonna turn this into a farm.

1924
02:02:18,500 --> 02:02:23,420
He doesn't really know that there's no
pathway for the streams that when the

1925
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:25,070
water comes down out of the
mountains and when it rains,

1926
02:02:25,071 --> 02:02:26,930
he doesn't know that there's
nowhere for it to go.

1927
02:02:26,931 --> 02:02:29,690
It doesn't make sense to the water.
So it just kind of floods everything.

1928
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:33,680
I'm still,
the more he looked,

1929
02:02:34,100 --> 02:02:38,120
the more he had questioned why the area
was under undeveloped. It won't be easy.

1930
02:02:38,121 --> 02:02:40,260
He thought excited by the challenge posed,

1931
02:02:40,280 --> 02:02:44,060
joining the water and earth to create
productive fields was not much different

1932
02:02:44,061 --> 02:02:48,020
than leading men and women in such a
way that civilization might bloom to

1933
02:02:48,021 --> 02:02:52,310
Musashi. It seemed that his goal was in
complete agreement with his ideals of

1934
02:02:52,311 --> 02:02:53,150
swordsmanship.

1935
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:58,310
He'd come to see the way of the sorta
new light a year or two earlier,

1936
02:02:58,490 --> 02:03:01,490
he had wanted only to conquer all rivals,

1937
02:03:01,880 --> 02:03:06,020
but now the idea that the sword existed
for the purpose of giving him power over

1938
02:03:06,021 --> 02:03:11,021
other people was unsatisfying
to cut people down to
triumph over them to display

1939
02:03:11,451 --> 02:03:15,020
the limits of one strength
seemed increasingly vain.

1940
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:19,760
He wanted to conquer himself,
to make life itself submit to him,

1941
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:22,760
to cause people to live rather than die.

1942
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:27,590
The way of the sword should not be
used merely for his own perfection.

1943
02:03:28,250 --> 02:03:32,300
It should be a source of strength for
governing governing people and leading

1944
02:03:32,301 --> 02:03:34,430
them to peace and happiness.

1945
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:39,980
He realized his grand ideals were no
more than dreams and would remain so as

1946
02:03:39,981 --> 02:03:42,680
long as he lacked the political
authority to implement them.

1947
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:47,810
But here in this wasteland,
he needed neither rank nor power.

1948
02:03:48,380 --> 02:03:53,240
He plunged into the struggle with joy
and enthusiasm day in and day out.

1949
02:03:53,241 --> 02:03:56,990
Stumps were uprooted.
Gravel sifted land level,

1950
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:00,820
soil and rocks made into dykes Musashi.

1951
02:04:00,850 --> 02:04:05,510
Ori worked from before dawn until after
the stars were shining bright in the

1952
02:04:05,511 --> 02:04:09,050
sky.
Now as he's doing this,

1953
02:04:09,051 --> 02:04:11,450
the villagers keep coming by and they say,

1954
02:04:11,451 --> 02:04:14,060
what do they think they're doing and how
do they think they can live in a place

1955
02:04:14,061 --> 02:04:15,800
like that?
And you're wasting your time.

1956
02:04:15,801 --> 02:04:19,710
That's what all the villagers are saying
to them. They've seen this for, you know,

1957
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:24,410
since 1100 or whatever, they've seen this
place get flooded and he keeps going.

1958
02:04:24,411 --> 02:04:28,460
He keeps, you know, trying. And
every time he makes some progress,

1959
02:04:29,250 --> 02:04:30,290
he the,

1960
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,700
it'll rain and everything gets washed
away or it'll get flooded and then he

1961
02:04:34,701 --> 02:04:36,970
thinks he's doing okay. And it's a big
snow in the mountains, so everything,

1962
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:38,040
but then it falls

1963
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,690
into every,
all the water comes down again.

1964
02:04:42,330 --> 02:04:45,840
So he goes on, he keeps working the
land, he keeps trying to make it work.

1965
02:04:46,020 --> 02:04:46,853
Back to the book.

1966
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:50,010
Musashi carried on in his stubborn
struggle throughout the winter,

1967
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:51,930
into the second month of the new year.

1968
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:56,430
It took several weeks of strenuous labor
to dig ditches, drain the water off,

1969
02:04:56,431 --> 02:05:00,930
piled dirt for a dyke, and then cover
it with heavy rocks. Three weeks later,

1970
02:05:00,931 --> 02:05:03,570
everything was again washed away.
Look,

1971
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:06,930
you already said we're wasting our
energy on something impossible.

1972
02:05:07,410 --> 02:05:11,910
Is that the way of the sword?
The question struck close to the bone,

1973
02:05:12,030 --> 02:05:16,950
but Musashi would not give. In only a
month passed before the next disaster,

1974
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:21,990
a heavy snow fall followed by a quick
fall EERE on his return trips from the

1975
02:05:21,991 --> 02:05:26,640
temple for food inevitably war along
face for the people there rode him

1976
02:05:26,641 --> 02:05:31,641
mercilessly about Musashi's failure and
finally Musashi himself began to lose

1977
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:37,521
heart for two full days and on into a
third he sat silently brooding and staring

1978
02:05:39,211 --> 02:05:42,630
at his field than it dawned on him.
Suddenly,

1979
02:05:43,230 --> 02:05:48,230
unconsciously he had been trying to create
a neat square field like those common

1980
02:05:49,111 --> 02:05:50,850
in other parts of the plane,

1981
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:55,620
but this was not what the
terrain called for here.

1982
02:05:55,710 --> 02:05:57,450
Despite the general flatness,

1983
02:05:57,660 --> 02:06:01,350
there were slight variations in the lay
of the land and the quality of the soil

1984
02:06:01,380 --> 02:06:05,730
that argued for an irregular shape.
What a fool I've been,

1985
02:06:05,731 --> 02:06:06,900
he exclaimed allowed.

1986
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:12,320
I tried to make the water flow where I
thought it should and force the dirt to

1987
02:06:12,751 --> 02:06:16,890
stay where I thought it ought to be,
but it didn't work.

1988
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:21,030
How could it water's water.

1989
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:25,380
Dirts dirt.
I can't change nature.

1990
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:30,540
What I've got to do is
learn to be a servant to the
water and a protector of the

1991
02:06:30,541 --> 02:06:33,420
land in his own way.

1992
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:37,440
He had submitted to the attitude
of the peasants. On that day,

1993
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:39,540
he became nature's man servant.

1994
02:06:40,170 --> 02:06:45,170
He sees trying to impose his will on
nature and let nature lead the way,

1995
02:06:45,570 --> 02:06:50,250
while at the same time seeking out
possibilities beyond the grasp of other

1996
02:06:50,251 --> 02:06:51,930
inhabitants of the plane.

1997
02:06:53,070 --> 02:06:57,990
The snow came again and another fall, the
muddy water. Ooh, slowly over the plane.

1998
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:03,320
But Musashi had had time to work out
as new approach and his field remained

1999
02:07:03,331 --> 02:07:07,770
intact. The same rules must
apply to governing people.

2000
02:07:07,771 --> 02:07:11,340
He said to himself in his notebook,
he wrote,

2001
02:07:11,670 --> 02:07:16,440
do not attempt to oppose the
way of the universe, but first,

2002
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:20,340
make sure you know the
way of the universe.

2003
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:27,030
As I was, uh, telling one of
my seal buddies about this,

2004
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:31,440
we were talking about that you
can't, you can't, as a leader,

2005
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:34,920
a lot of times people want to
change people. You want to change

2006
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,790
and you, you just, you can't
change people. Right? I mean,

2007
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:42,850
you can shift them and
vacant change themselves,

2008
02:07:43,150 --> 02:07:45,220
but when you try and
impose change on someone,

2009
02:07:45,221 --> 02:07:49,870
you try and make someone what you want
them to be. It's very difficult to do,

2010
02:07:50,290 --> 02:07:51,340
if not impossible.

2011
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:56,670
I was talking about this one had a guy
in a seal platoon and he had potential,

2012
02:07:57,161 --> 02:07:59,560
right? But he had some flaws, you know,

2013
02:07:59,650 --> 02:08:03,850
he was a blowout mouth in that kind of
thing and just wanted like to bring them

2014
02:08:03,851 --> 02:08:08,700
along and tried everything. Beatings, um,

2015
02:08:08,860 --> 02:08:13,510
counselings, um, you know,
befriending, um, more beatings,

2016
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:16,090
did everything and,
and you know,

2017
02:08:16,091 --> 02:08:18,850
he would like make slight adjustments
for a little while and then he'd go back

2018
02:08:18,851 --> 02:08:22,090
to just being the way he was. And
eventually I said, okay, well we have to,

2019
02:08:22,420 --> 02:08:26,230
that's the way he is. That's the
way this person is. And you know,

2020
02:08:26,231 --> 02:08:28,480
how do we work with him?

2021
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:33,481
So he's working within the confines
of things that he can do and do them

2022
02:08:33,491 --> 02:08:34,324
acceptably.

2023
02:08:34,570 --> 02:08:38,560
But I think people get caught on the
idea that they're going to change people.

2024
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:39,940
And it's really hard and you see this,

2025
02:08:39,941 --> 02:08:43,000
especially with people getting involved
in relationships with people that they

2026
02:08:43,001 --> 02:08:45,580
think they're going to be able to change
and you're not going to be able to do

2027
02:08:45,581 --> 02:08:48,970
it. I have a question for you. Juggle in,

2028
02:08:49,210 --> 02:08:52,960
in your own life experience.
How do you separate

2029
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:59,650
the way of the universe?
Meaning in you personally,

2030
02:08:59,651 --> 02:09:03,610
the things that are just you that you
shouldn't try to change versus the things

2031
02:09:03,611 --> 02:09:06,760
that you should try to improve these?
I think that there,

2032
02:09:06,860 --> 02:09:09,970
there's the temptation for a lot of people
to say, well that's just the way I am,

2033
02:09:09,971 --> 02:09:13,780
but it's, it absolves them of the
responsibility of doing the work.

2034
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:18,550
I got asked a similar question and it'll
tie into it, but I got asked by, um,

2035
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:21,220
I was working with a company the
other day and a guy asked, you know,

2036
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:24,670
if I've got a guy that's really good at
something but a person that's not really

2037
02:09:24,671 --> 02:09:25,180
good shit,

2038
02:09:25,180 --> 02:09:28,450
should I just give up on trying to get
the person that's not good at that job?

2039
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:31,210
Give up on them and just let the
person that's good at it. Do it.

2040
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:35,470
And I said, well, yes and no. I mean,

2041
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:39,550
if we have somebody that is a really
good shot, like he's a sniper,

2042
02:09:39,580 --> 02:09:41,590
but we've got a guy that's
not a good shot. Okay,

2043
02:09:41,591 --> 02:09:44,290
so we're going to give the sniper all
the good missions and he's going to go do

2044
02:09:44,291 --> 02:09:46,180
all the tough shots. Okay.
Yeah, that makes sense.

2045
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:49,570
That doesn't mean we just let the other
guy never learned how to shoot. No,

2046
02:09:49,571 --> 02:09:53,200
we actually continue to train him and
make him better and I think it's the same

2047
02:09:53,201 --> 02:09:58,060
thing with your, your your individual
self. Right? If I've got weaknesses,

2048
02:09:58,750 --> 02:09:59,471
I don't just say,
well,

2049
02:09:59,471 --> 02:10:02,380
I'm just going to avoid being
in those areas where I'm weak.

2050
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:05,440
I'm going to actually go and
try and get better at them.

2051
02:10:05,590 --> 02:10:07,810
Now I'm not going to make that
the focus of my life. Right.

2052
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:12,310
I'm not going to try and
become a ballerina. Right.

2053
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:16,510
What I like to be more flexible.
Absolutely. Do I need to
work on that? Absolutely.

2054
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:18,850
But I'm not trying to become a ballerina.

2055
02:10:18,851 --> 02:10:23,290
I wouldn't focus on that because it
would be a significant waste of my time.

2056
02:10:23,291 --> 02:10:26,770
End of my entire life in a
very fruitless situation.

2057
02:10:26,830 --> 02:10:31,360
But that doesn't mean I shouldn't try and
be more flexible. Right? So I think you,

2058
02:10:31,420 --> 02:10:36,020
you, you still apply time too to try and
improve it, but you don't waste, you know,

2059
02:10:36,021 --> 02:10:37,730
you don't waste a valuable energy.

2060
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:40,100
You'd still look at what you're
good at and say, you know,

2061
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:43,550
I'm better at doing Jujitsu,
I'm better at whatever.

2062
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:45,870
Can I tell you,
uh,

2063
02:10:45,940 --> 02:10:50,940
one of the thoughts that for whatever
reason consumed my mind for about an hour

2064
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:53,330
and a half during my
silent meditation retreat,

2065
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:58,750
I was thinking about giraffes
can't dance this book,

2066
02:10:59,160 --> 02:11:02,950
this, this demon slayer
that crushes me on Amazon.

2067
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,420
Always buy like five spots.

2068
02:11:04,990 --> 02:11:09,670
When I launch a book and I
started thinking about how
incredible it would be to

2069
02:11:09,671 --> 02:11:14,010
take Jocko the cartoon character,
uh,

2070
02:11:14,050 --> 02:11:19,050
as seen in the Jocko approved logo on
your t and to have a parody of that book

2071
02:11:21,371 --> 02:11:22,061
called Jocko,

2072
02:11:22,061 --> 02:11:26,620
can't dance with like thought bubbles
of what you're thinking throughout the

2073
02:11:26,621 --> 02:11:31,510
book. In any case, for whatever reason,
that is what my mind decided to settle on.

2074
02:11:31,600 --> 02:11:34,970
And, uh, I'm sorry. Uh,

2075
02:11:37,410 --> 02:11:39,430
so confession over confession.

2076
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,740
Consider do you find that
yourself that you say like, Oh,

2077
02:11:41,741 --> 02:11:45,010
I'm not good at this Roman to avoid it?
Or do you find yourself getting focused?

2078
02:11:45,011 --> 02:11:45,731
Cause you know,

2079
02:11:45,731 --> 02:11:49,090
you're talking about what Musashi's wha
what they described Musashi do and as

2080
02:11:49,091 --> 02:11:52,330
earlier, which is I only worry about
things that are beating me. Right?

2081
02:11:52,360 --> 02:11:53,680
I only worry about the opponent,
the baby,

2082
02:11:53,710 --> 02:11:56,620
just like the only book you think about
as this book, giraffes can't dance,

2083
02:11:56,860 --> 02:12:00,190
which is the one book that
beats you because, and that's
what you're focused on.

2084
02:12:00,191 --> 02:12:02,460
Your worry about these other books
that you kicked the crap out.

2085
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:06,850
I also just like talking about it
because I love the fact that it's called

2086
02:12:06,851 --> 02:12:09,370
giraffes can't dance
and it kicks your ass.

2087
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:12,160
Do you think you get
focused on things that are,

2088
02:12:12,730 --> 02:12:17,500
that you shouldn't be focused on or
that you're wasting time on? Uh, I, I,

2089
02:12:18,140 --> 02:12:21,130
you kind of know what
you're good at. I do. Uh,

2090
02:12:21,131 --> 02:12:24,540
I think that I've become better at

2091
02:12:24,700 --> 02:12:29,700
working on or distinguishing between
low level weaknesses in high level

2092
02:12:32,141 --> 02:12:35,110
weaknesses.
And what I mean by that is if you imagine,

2093
02:12:36,370 --> 02:12:41,370
say a people have seen like a champagne
pyramid where sometimes built at

2094
02:12:42,041 --> 02:12:46,150
weddings where you stack up all of these
champagne glasses and you pour into one

2095
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:51,560
or it could be any type of glass and
it cascades down into the others. Uh,

2096
02:12:52,150 --> 02:12:54,250
where you could think of it
through a domino analogy.

2097
02:12:54,251 --> 02:12:57,100
I use this analogy a lot
looking at lead dominoes.

2098
02:12:57,101 --> 02:12:59,860
Like what can I do if I have a task list,
let's say,

2099
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:04,890
which of these five tasks we'll make
all of the others easier or irrelevant.

2100
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:10,800
And that'll help me sequence things in
the right order so that I'm not wasting

2101
02:13:11,260 --> 02:13:14,140
energy. Uh, if I have 10 units of energy,

2102
02:13:14,141 --> 02:13:18,280
I'd rather focus on identifying at
least to begin with the lead dominoes.

2103
02:13:18,280 --> 02:13:22,120
And so a high level
weakness would be a week.

2104
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:27,150
A lead domino is something that has
downstream negative effects on many

2105
02:13:27,341 --> 02:13:31,920
different areas even, uh, that
can compromise your strengths,

2106
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:36,280
right? Uh, so for me, for
instance, I think, uh,

2107
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:41,700
for a very long time I viewed,
uh,

2108
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:46,730
I only viewed impatience through the
lens of the benefits of aggression.

2109
02:13:47,070 --> 02:13:48,270
Because having a good,

2110
02:13:48,271 --> 02:13:52,380
authentic has always
been my model ever since.

2111
02:13:52,381 --> 02:13:57,381
I became fascinated by Dan Gable who
is about as close to a hundred percent

2112
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:00,300
offense,

2113
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:04,950
legendary wrestling a
competitor and coach,

2114
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:09,720
uh, ah man, I have a lot of stories
about Dan Gable, uh, incredible,

2115
02:14:09,721 --> 02:14:13,820
incredible guy. But uh, I,
what I've realized in the
last few years for instance,

2116
02:14:13,821 --> 02:14:18,600
is that there are low level weaknesses.
Let's say I am not a programmer.

2117
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:22,770
I am not good at a, B, c,

2118
02:14:22,771 --> 02:14:27,510
d or e skill that is more of a,
a technician's craft.

2119
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:31,590
I will not spend time on those things
if I can delegate it or outsource it.

2120
02:14:31,620 --> 02:14:36,620
But if there are core psychological
traits that are higher order that can

2121
02:14:37,741 --> 02:14:41,490
negatively impact other
things, then I've realized, uh,

2122
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:44,240
for the long haul.
Uh,

2123
02:14:44,250 --> 02:14:47,520
I do want to at least experiment with

2124
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:50,940
developing those capacities.

2125
02:14:51,730 --> 02:14:56,710
I think has helped me a lot is I'm always,
and I was,

2126
02:14:56,960 --> 02:14:59,830
when I was in the seal teams,
I was always looking at other people.

2127
02:15:00,220 --> 02:15:01,930
I was always looking at their leadership.

2128
02:15:01,931 --> 02:15:04,210
I was looking at what they're doing
and I was looking at why they weren't

2129
02:15:04,211 --> 02:15:06,460
getting along. I was looking at
what was wrong with the platoon.

2130
02:15:07,330 --> 02:15:11,560
And as I would sit there and watch these
people, I would learn from because,

2131
02:15:11,660 --> 02:15:15,460
and I'd say, you know, I'd see two people
that didn't get along. And I'd say, wow,

2132
02:15:15,470 --> 02:15:17,470
why don't get, why can't these guys
get along? What's wrong with them?

2133
02:15:17,471 --> 02:15:21,040
And I'd watch him and I'd see that, you
know, this one guy has a giant ego. Oh.

2134
02:15:21,041 --> 02:15:22,060
And so is the other guy.

2135
02:15:22,090 --> 02:15:25,450
And instead of one of them
disarming the other guy's ego,

2136
02:15:25,451 --> 02:15:28,690
they both can't figure that out. And so
they're just battling and it's, you know,

2137
02:15:28,691 --> 02:15:31,900
you got that in inside of a seal
platoon. It's a horrible thing. And,

2138
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:34,360
and so as I'd watch them,
it allowed me that,

2139
02:15:34,361 --> 02:15:37,780
then I could see it in myself where
I would see, oh, I like, I've,

2140
02:15:38,040 --> 02:15:40,810
I've got frustrated with someone I'd say,
or I'd get,

2141
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:44,230
I have a negative thought about someone.
I think,

2142
02:15:44,231 --> 02:15:47,590
why do I have that negative thought about
that person that's actually a bad ass?

2143
02:15:47,620 --> 02:15:52,620
Or it seems like a really strong
personality or a strong presence.

2144
02:15:52,810 --> 02:15:55,600
Right. Why do I have that? Oh,
I have that cause that's my ego.

2145
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:59,110
And it's the same thing with when
I see people getting excited, um,

2146
02:15:59,890 --> 02:16:02,740
I don't think excitement is usually
a positive thing. I mean it's not,

2147
02:16:02,741 --> 02:16:06,310
it's not a negative thing,
but sometimes people in a meeting,

2148
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:10,810
someone just immediately has
an opinion and, and I think,

2149
02:16:11,140 --> 02:16:12,170
and I watched their,

2150
02:16:12,200 --> 02:16:15,100
their opinion fall apart because
they didn't listen long enough.

2151
02:16:15,100 --> 02:16:16,570
They didn't assess things long enough.

2152
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:21,160
And so I hear them state their opinion
and they stayed it with vigor and with,

2153
02:16:21,190 --> 02:16:25,030
with conviction. And then you listen
to it and all of a sudden they, they,

2154
02:16:25,031 --> 02:16:30,031
they can't help but look bad
because what they thought was wrong.

2155
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:33,640
And I probably had the same thoughts as
I sat there and I kept my mouth shut and

2156
02:16:33,641 --> 02:16:36,850
I listened. And, and so I'd see people
do that. And I said, you know what,

2157
02:16:36,851 --> 02:16:39,570
when you're in a meeting and there's
people talking about things, do,

2158
02:16:39,600 --> 02:16:40,480
you don't need to say anything.

2159
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,660
You don't need to appear
stupid or whatever it is.
He better do appear stupid,

2160
02:16:43,661 --> 02:16:46,470
then open your mouth and remove
all doubt, right? This is just,

2161
02:16:46,480 --> 02:16:49,630
but I would learn these things
about people, which I think were,

2162
02:16:49,631 --> 02:16:54,260
were helpful to me just by watching an
and seeing people and being really, uh,

2163
02:16:54,940 --> 02:16:58,930
really kind of a jerk in my own mind.
Like I watch people like a jerk. Like,

2164
02:16:58,931 --> 02:17:03,520
why would you do that? What's wrong with
you? Very accusatory tone in my own head.

2165
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:07,240
But then it was really easy for me to
flip that back on myself all the time and

2166
02:17:07,241 --> 02:17:10,330
say, well wait a second. You do that too.
Wait a second. You make that same mistake.

2167
02:17:10,600 --> 02:17:13,330
So I think that from a
psychological perspective,

2168
02:17:13,420 --> 02:17:18,130
I think what's given me a good perspective
of my own psychology is watching

2169
02:17:18,131 --> 02:17:20,770
other people intently
and closely with the,

2170
02:17:21,010 --> 02:17:26,010
with the goal of actually helping them
correct that of bill going up to the guy

2171
02:17:26,141 --> 02:17:26,974
and say,
hey man,

2172
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:30,880
this is your ego versus that guy's ego
and you're either going to want to,

2173
02:17:30,890 --> 02:17:34,300
you is going to have to disarm the other
one or your guys are never going to go

2174
02:17:34,301 --> 02:17:35,950
along and this never do a move forward.

2175
02:17:36,430 --> 02:17:39,330
And so I think that really
helped me out a lot. I'm sure

2176
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:39,710
it,

2177
02:17:39,710 --> 02:17:44,710
and I have found certainly that there
are many benefits in my case of being a

2178
02:17:47,040 --> 02:17:51,200
solo practitioner, so
to speak, uh, being, uh,

2179
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:56,400
unemployed slash self employed
for decades now. But the,

2180
02:17:56,460 --> 02:18:01,460
one of the clear downsides is that I
don't have that in person peer group to

2181
02:18:01,771 --> 02:18:06,771
observe or superiors or subordinates to
observe it with the rare exception of a

2182
02:18:07,231 --> 02:18:10,170
handful of employees now.
But the,

2183
02:18:10,171 --> 02:18:14,130
what I ended up doing for myself to
try to improve because I didn't have,

2184
02:18:14,131 --> 02:18:17,520
I assumed, and I think this is good for
a lot of people, do assume that you,

2185
02:18:17,550 --> 02:18:22,550
you may not have sufficient self
awareness to accurately self diagnose your

2186
02:18:25,741 --> 02:18:26,820
weaknesses and strengths.

2187
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:30,570
So I would seek out environments
that made it very obvious.

2188
02:18:31,110 --> 02:18:33,750
And the way I did that,
and I think we saw,

2189
02:18:33,751 --> 02:18:37,130
she in a way alludes to this,
uh,

2190
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:41,880
is if you say are on the battlefield

2191
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:45,330
in massage case,

2192
02:18:45,630 --> 02:18:50,630
your strengths and weaknesses or at least
your weaknesses tend to become clearer

2193
02:18:51,330 --> 02:18:52,350
or magnified.

2194
02:18:52,710 --> 02:18:56,970
So if I could put myself into a really
intense training environment like Aka in

2195
02:18:56,971 --> 02:19:01,380
San Jose, a lot of professionals
there, uh, at the time,

2196
02:19:01,381 --> 02:19:06,381
Cain Velasquez and a number of others
and training with Dave in a handful of

2197
02:19:07,770 --> 02:19:12,510
folks, I could watch my response
to increasing levels of stress.

2198
02:19:12,511 --> 02:19:14,640
Like how did I respond to extreme heat?

2199
02:19:15,030 --> 02:19:19,770
What was the self talk when
I wanted to quit? Did I, uh,

2200
02:19:19,771 --> 02:19:23,850
at what point was I inclined to try to
find someone easy to roll with? Like,

2201
02:19:23,851 --> 02:19:28,480
how many rounds did it take?
Right? Wasn't it? And uh,

2202
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:33,560
and then could I then I would note that,
and I would actually take notes.

2203
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:37,040
I bring my notebook and just you can see
I have notebooks everywhere here and I

2204
02:19:37,041 --> 02:19:41,060
would note the, not just the technical
learnings and what I wanted to approve,

2205
02:19:41,061 --> 02:19:42,680
but the,
the,

2206
02:19:43,370 --> 02:19:47,660
the decisions and the self talk that
I made that I want to improve upon and

2207
02:19:47,661 --> 02:19:48,291
experiment with that.

2208
02:19:48,291 --> 02:19:53,291
So I used the physical arena as a
way to try to identify the high level

2209
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:58,300
weaknesses that I could
work on because uh,

2210
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:01,520
everybody has a plan until they
get punched in the face. Right.

2211
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:05,480
So it's all great and theoretically
academically beautiful to sit down and try

2212
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:08,870
to self analyze when you're journaling
in the morning, which I also do,

2213
02:20:08,871 --> 02:20:11,060
but it's quite another thing
to be like, okay, tough guy.

2214
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:15,620
Yeah. Even with that long
explanation, I just gave it,

2215
02:20:15,621 --> 02:20:19,370
look in all these people, I didn't
care. I wasn't consciously thinking,

2216
02:20:20,210 --> 02:20:23,510
actually it wasn't even consciously
thinking about it from a psychological

2217
02:20:23,511 --> 02:20:26,540
perspective. I was just thinking it
from a pragmatic, here's two guys,

2218
02:20:26,541 --> 02:20:30,150
why don't they get along? And then when I
would see myself, dude, I go, oh, you're,

2219
02:20:30,170 --> 02:20:34,850
you're like, you're doing the same
stupid stuff. It wasn't like this,

2220
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:37,400
um,
you know,

2221
02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:42,320
this idea of I was looking at myself
and I was just doing what I had to do.

2222
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:42,920
Right.

2223
02:20:42,920 --> 02:20:47,900
I guess there's always the subconscious
feeling of like trying to do better and

2224
02:20:47,901 --> 02:20:52,450
trying to self improve,
but I'm not a person that has the,

2225
02:20:52,540 --> 02:20:56,640
the constant like, um, I'm trying to
self improve. I think it's just a,

2226
02:20:56,900 --> 02:20:59,780
it's just a natural thing. Yeah.
I'm trying to get better of course,

2227
02:20:59,930 --> 02:21:02,270
but that's not, I don't think about
it. That's, I guess that's my point.

2228
02:21:02,340 --> 02:21:05,360
I don't think about, I'm not
focused on it. I'm just doing it.

2229
02:21:05,390 --> 02:21:08,130
I'm just doing it and living it
yet. Well, I think in [inaudible] in

2230
02:21:08,130 --> 02:21:13,050
your case, and uh, I have,
well we have some mutual
friends, I mean from the seals,

2231
02:21:13,051 --> 02:21:17,930
but also a force recon and a number of,

2232
02:21:17,990 --> 02:21:20,280
of friends who have,
uh,

2233
02:21:21,780 --> 02:21:25,950
been engaged at very high levels
in elite ranks within the military.

2234
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:30,130
And I think that in my
experience thus far, uh,

2235
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,070
most of them have,

2236
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:37,130
whether it's by virtue of the filtering
that their careers impose on them,

2237
02:21:39,660 --> 02:21:43,200
right? I mean you have thousand
people start at step one.

2238
02:21:43,201 --> 02:21:46,740
How many make it to step
a hundred? Uh, that they,

2239
02:21:47,010 --> 02:21:52,010
they self select an are selected to have
a high degree of what I would consider

2240
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:54,060
or what you could consider mindfulness,

2241
02:21:54,061 --> 02:21:57,650
which is usually associated with like
hippies and San Francisco with Didgeridoo

2242
02:21:57,651 --> 02:22:01,290
is and burning man and so on.
It's, it's a buzzword there.

2243
02:22:01,291 --> 02:22:06,291
But I think the ability to detach
in that way comes naturally to you.

2244
02:22:08,220 --> 02:22:13,220
And to many people I know who
also have made it to step 100,

2245
02:22:13,890 --> 02:22:15,330
they just seem in a military context,

2246
02:22:15,331 --> 02:22:20,331
if you don't have that you and certainly
you can get killed or get washed out

2247
02:22:20,370 --> 02:22:24,720
for many different reasons.
But I think if one of them seems to be,

2248
02:22:24,721 --> 02:22:26,250
if you no self awareness,

2249
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,710
you just, you get broken or you
get disqualified at some point or,

2250
02:22:31,770 --> 02:22:36,190
or you, you get as good as the machine
can make you. And I think that's,

2251
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:38,460
that's the real difference.
You get as good as the machine,

2252
02:22:38,461 --> 02:22:40,190
the machine's going to make
you good. Right? Right.

2253
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:45,540
But you the only person that can take you
pass what the machine can make as you.

2254
02:22:45,930 --> 02:22:49,290
And so if you're not self aware, if you
can't, if you can't figure that out,

2255
02:22:49,291 --> 02:22:51,900
if you can't look in the mirror and
see like things that you can correct,

2256
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:54,510
then you're, you're just going
to be what the machine made you,

2257
02:22:54,511 --> 02:22:57,120
which is a high quality
item. I mean, you know,

2258
02:22:57,121 --> 02:23:01,980
the military is filled with some
high quality guys, great guys,

2259
02:23:02,070 --> 02:23:04,050
fabulous guys that perform outstanding.

2260
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:08,840
But then there's like this one more
little level of guys that are where you,

2261
02:23:08,841 --> 02:23:11,460
you look at him and you go, man, that
guy is really good at what, why is that?

2262
02:23:11,460 --> 02:23:12,300
That's because that guy,

2263
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:14,250
the machine got him to here and
he's looking at myself going,

2264
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:17,580
what can I do better? He's got that
detachment and that's definitely,

2265
02:23:19,530 --> 02:23:24,090
definitely important. I got to
introduce somebody in this book now,

2266
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:29,040
um, that there's, his name is Sasaki.

2267
02:23:29,100 --> 02:23:33,660
Could Jiro Gun Room? I'd have
to see the last part. Yeah.

2268
02:23:33,661 --> 02:23:38,340
He got the first g. A. N. R. Y you
got new you guys to be a hard to say.

2269
02:23:38,980 --> 02:23:42,750
Come to, I guess I'm going to go
with what I'm calling. So this guy,

2270
02:23:42,751 --> 02:23:45,180
and he dances the in and
out throughout the book,

2271
02:23:45,181 --> 02:23:48,330
but this is Musashi's uh,

2272
02:23:48,520 --> 02:23:52,440
archrival the other swordsmen that's
got this incredible reputation only.

2273
02:23:52,441 --> 02:23:54,390
He's been a little bit more,
he stays on the scene more.

2274
02:23:54,391 --> 02:23:57,150
Musashi is going in trying to
farm and doing other things.

2275
02:23:57,600 --> 02:24:01,740
And this guy's kind of
on the scene and there's,

2276
02:24:01,770 --> 02:24:06,180
there's one part where these elderly
gentlemen are talking about who is truly

2277
02:24:06,181 --> 02:24:10,470
the best swordsman Slash Samurai in Japan.
And here we go to the book.

2278
02:24:10,500 --> 02:24:11,600
As he compared the two,

2279
02:24:11,601 --> 02:24:14,940
he had to admit that the most
Daimiel am I saying that right?

2280
02:24:14,941 --> 02:24:19,941
The time you meal would prefer could
he came from a good family and he had

2281
02:24:21,181 --> 02:24:23,790
started the art of war
thoroughly despite his youth.

2282
02:24:23,791 --> 02:24:27,780
He'd developed a formidable style of his
own and he gained considerable to fame

2283
02:24:27,781 --> 02:24:28,614
as a fighter.

2284
02:24:29,550 --> 02:24:34,550
The story of his brilliant defeat of men
from the old Bata Academy on the banks

2285
02:24:34,981 --> 02:24:36,300
of the Sumida river.

2286
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:40,740
And again at the dike on the condo
river was already well known.

2287
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,710
Nothing had been heard
from Musashi for some time.

2288
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:48,810
His victory at each show,
each GI Joe Gi had made his reputation,

2289
02:24:49,170 --> 02:24:54,170
but that had been years ago and soon
afterward had spread this story that the

2290
02:24:56,611 --> 02:25:01,200
story was exaggerated,
that Musashi was a seeker of after fame,

2291
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:05,970
who had trumped up the fight, made a
flashy attack, and then fled to mount. He,

2292
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:10,470
every time we saw she did
something praiseworthy,

2293
02:25:10,710 --> 02:25:15,120
a spate of rumors followed
denigrating his character and ability.

2294
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:20,370
It had reached the point where even the
mention of his name usually met with

2295
02:25:20,371 --> 02:25:24,910
critical remarks or,
or else people ignore them entirely.

2296
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:28,420
As the son of a nameless
warrior in the mountains of me,

2297
02:25:28,421 --> 02:25:31,420
Masaka his lineage was insignificant.

2298
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:38,530
So he kind of faded and he does
some dumb stuff too, right?

2299
02:25:38,560 --> 02:25:40,360
Like he does dumb things
like he's a young,

2300
02:25:41,260 --> 02:25:45,370
you didn't come from that from the ranks
that have people that were counseling

2301
02:25:45,371 --> 02:25:46,031
him and keep him in line.

2302
02:25:46,031 --> 02:25:50,770
So he did dumb stuff like have battles
against whole castles and attack people.

2303
02:25:50,780 --> 02:25:55,300
He was kind of crazy. Yeah. Right. And
so his reputation and then of course,

2304
02:25:55,870 --> 02:25:59,170
you know this is like a, I guess
ancient social media, right?

2305
02:25:59,171 --> 02:26:02,500
There was rumors and they would post
signs about people and they would do these

2306
02:26:02,501 --> 02:26:05,110
things to denigrate people's
reputations and such.

2307
02:26:05,111 --> 02:26:06,900
And they had done that
considerably to massage it.

2308
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:10,700
Just thinking about how
labor intensive it would be,

2309
02:26:11,360 --> 02:26:16,360
you're talking about spreading posters
like to hand create piles of posters that

2310
02:26:17,661 --> 02:26:19,970
you then go post to denigrate someone.

2311
02:26:19,971 --> 02:26:24,590
Like the equivalent of a tweet was
like sitting down for a week and a hand

2312
02:26:24,591 --> 02:26:26,330
making posters to put around town

2313
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:28,860
and they do it in this book that you do.
I mean it's full times.

2314
02:26:28,870 --> 02:26:33,040
They go on both sides. People write sign,
Musashi does it, the other people do it.

2315
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:37,330
It's um, yeah, it's, it's crazy.

2316
02:26:37,331 --> 02:26:40,210
And we're getting toward getting closer.
Closer.

2317
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:46,150
We saw she's wandering
in the mountains and

2318
02:26:47,970 --> 02:26:49,140
here we go back to the book.

2319
02:26:51,590 --> 02:26:54,260
At times he was so
tortured with his sword.

2320
02:26:55,150 --> 02:26:55,550
Okay.

2321
02:26:55,550 --> 02:26:57,830
It seemed like a weapon
that turned against him.

2322
02:26:57,980 --> 02:27:01,280
Among the possibilities he
considered was choosing the easy way.

2323
02:27:02,150 --> 02:27:06,470
If he could bring himself to live in
a comfortable, ordinary way with Ohsu,

2324
02:27:06,650 --> 02:27:07,790
life would be simple.

2325
02:27:08,150 --> 02:27:11,930
Almost any fife would be willing to
pay him enough to live on perhaps 500,

2326
02:27:11,931 --> 02:27:15,020
2000 bushels.
But when he put it,

2327
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:18,560
but when he put it to himself
in the form of a question,

2328
02:27:18,680 --> 02:27:20,510
the answer was always no.

2329
02:27:21,410 --> 02:27:25,070
An easy existence imposed restrictions.

2330
02:27:25,580 --> 02:27:27,350
He could not submit to them.

2331
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:29,160
Okay.

2332
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:32,850
Three's get, he got the idea, you know,
I could just marry to get a good job,

2333
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:35,280
make a hundred k a year,
we'll call it good.

2334
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:40,200
He doesn't like that though,
doesn't it? Not like it.

2335
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:45,160
The easy path has restrictions. It is
the discipline that provides freedom.

2336
02:27:45,490 --> 02:27:47,110
Apparently for Musashi

2337
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:52,850
done as a contemporary example, uh, one
of my a, I would consider him a teacher.

2338
02:27:52,851 --> 02:27:53,780
He certainly become a friend,

2339
02:27:53,781 --> 02:27:58,781
but a political originally at least when
he came to the u s a Polish political

2340
02:28:00,021 --> 02:28:04,430
refugee named Jersey Gregorich.
He's now in his sixties lives in Woodside,

2341
02:28:04,431 --> 02:28:05,150
California,

2342
02:28:05,150 --> 02:28:10,150
and he's a world champion and world
record holder and Olympic weightlifting.

2343
02:28:10,910 --> 02:28:15,710
Yeah, as is his wife. He, he, that was a
good podcast by the way. Oh yeah, he's,

2344
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:17,630
he's awesome.
He's so salty.

2345
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:20,900
And to give people a little bit of
back on the first time I met him,

2346
02:28:22,170 --> 02:28:27,170
I was just at the time suffering from
a malaise in a general fatigue with the

2347
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:32,300
hypersensitivity of the bay area.

2348
02:28:33,170 --> 02:28:37,790
And I walked in to meet him for the first
time to get an assessment and we sat

2349
02:28:37,791 --> 02:28:40,610
down and we drank Marco Polo black tea.

2350
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:42,920
It's the only tea that he drinks
and he's like, have a seat.

2351
02:28:43,050 --> 02:28:46,160
So I sit down and we're talking,
he's asking me about my goals,

2352
02:28:46,161 --> 02:28:47,270
about my athletic background,

2353
02:28:47,271 --> 02:28:51,320
past injuries and he's sitting across
from me is ease in great shape.

2354
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:55,550
He's in his sixties he,
he can still do well as an example,

2355
02:28:55,580 --> 02:29:00,230
I've seen him on an endo board. You
know, those aren't some balance boards,

2356
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:04,550
like a wobble board on top of a
cylinder with a loaded barbell.

2357
02:29:06,020 --> 02:29:10,040
He's holding a loaded barbell
in a position like a hand
clean on an Indo board.

2358
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,910
Uh, he's in his sixties throw
it up, you know, for like 150,

2359
02:29:13,911 --> 02:29:16,670
200 pounds and land in
a full ass to heels,

2360
02:29:16,730 --> 02:29:20,220
snatch on an Endovar that is legit.

2361
02:29:20,250 --> 02:29:25,160
And so he reached across sipping
tea and then he stopped mid,

2362
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:30,290
mid thought and reached across and sort
of pit pinched my right to and just said

2363
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:35,090
you owe to fat. So I just loved this
guy. Like after that I was like, yes,

2364
02:29:35,140 --> 02:29:36,200
we are going to work together.

2365
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:41,680
But his one of his mantras that he
uses for everything is easy choices,

2366
02:29:43,221 --> 02:29:45,860
hard life, hard choices, easy life.

2367
02:29:48,080 --> 02:29:51,860
Discipline Equals Freedom for sure.
That's awesome. That is awesome.

2368
02:29:53,270 --> 02:29:57,140
Did you like get on the program with him?
I did for quite a period of time. Yeah.

2369
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:59,420
And where you were you traveling down?
I mean,

2370
02:29:59,421 --> 02:30:03,350
how does do following instructions and
trust me coaching you are traveled down

2371
02:30:03,470 --> 02:30:07,430
regularly and um,
made excellent progress.

2372
02:30:07,460 --> 02:30:12,460
It's very to do Olympic weight lifting
the way that Jersey would want you to do

2373
02:30:13,191 --> 02:30:16,520
it. Uh, and which is the
way I would want to do it.

2374
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:21,050
You really need hands on
instruction. It's highly, highly,

2375
02:30:21,051 --> 02:30:22,850
highly technical. And, uh,

2376
02:30:22,851 --> 02:30:26,300
also you need a logical progression
because most people who just want to do a

2377
02:30:26,301 --> 02:30:28,220
weekend course and figure out the snatch,

2378
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:32,000
they do not have any of the
ankle or shoulder mobility,

2379
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:37,270
thoracic spine mobility to even perform
the right movement regardless of who the

2380
02:30:38,541 --> 02:30:39,110
instructor is.

2381
02:30:39,110 --> 02:30:42,710
They could have a 500 time world
champion teaching them and doing video

2382
02:30:42,711 --> 02:30:45,070
recording,
but if they had don't have the mobility,

2383
02:30:45,100 --> 02:30:48,230
there's going to hurt themselves. So
I went down regularly and then, uh,

2384
02:30:48,231 --> 02:30:49,250
when I was traveling with,

2385
02:30:49,251 --> 02:30:52,490
sent him video and he would
reply with video commentary,

2386
02:30:53,060 --> 02:30:54,740
a great experience.
I mean,

2387
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:59,830
I still think the Jersey style
relatively narrow stance as to the grass,

2388
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:06,890
uh, overhead squat, one of
the best movements. What, how,

2389
02:31:06,891 --> 02:31:10,850
why does his grip when he does that?
It's a snatch grip. So it'd be a wider,

2390
02:31:11,210 --> 02:31:15,020
wider grip, but he can, there are videos
of Jersey people can look them up.

2391
02:31:15,021 --> 02:31:19,710
J E R Z y Gregorich Gre,
g o r e.

2392
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:21,350
K a.

2393
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:24,940
Their videos that he is one of the most
flexible mobile humans I've ever seen

2394
02:31:24,941 --> 02:31:29,340
any strong as an ox.
But he can with his feet together,

2395
02:31:30,680 --> 02:31:31,080
uh,

2396
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:36,080
holding a say 35 pound plate overhead
with his hands flat underneath it.

2397
02:31:37,381 --> 02:31:39,150
Like he's holding a dinner platter,

2398
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:43,560
go down into a perfect
squat with his chest up,

2399
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:45,840
asked to his heels,

2400
02:31:46,350 --> 02:31:50,020
holding that overhead with his
fingers, basically touching. Yeah.

2401
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:55,170
Which people might say, Oh, I could do
that. Trust me. You can't like, trust me,

2402
02:31:55,171 --> 02:31:56,004
you cannot do it.

2403
02:31:57,190 --> 02:32:01,430
That's, that's awesome. So
we're getting towards the,

2404
02:32:01,480 --> 02:32:03,540
towards the end here,
this again, this, um,

2405
02:32:04,390 --> 02:32:09,390
rivalry is brewing and finally there is a,

2406
02:32:09,491 --> 02:32:13,360
speaking of social media,
there is a command issued by the castle.

2407
02:32:13,361 --> 02:32:17,080
And here's what it says on the 13th day
of this month at eight o'clock in the

2408
02:32:17,081 --> 02:32:22,081
morning on Fukushima in the
Nevado straights of Buzan Sasaki,

2409
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:29,320
could Jiro gone through a Samurai of
this Phif will add his lordship's bidding

2410
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,760
fight about with me.
You motto Masashi Masana,

2411
02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:39,780
a Ronin from the province of Nema Soka 80,

2412
02:32:39,810 --> 02:32:44,650
strictly forbidden for supporters of
either swordsmen to go to his aid or set

2413
02:32:44,651 --> 02:32:49,450
forth on the water between the
mainland and Fushi Nama and Funy Shama,

2414
02:32:49,451 --> 02:32:53,770
sorry until 10 o'clock on
the morning of the 13th.

2415
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:55,210
No sight seeing vessels,

2416
02:32:55,600 --> 02:32:59,830
passenger ships and fishing boats will
be permitted to enter the straights.

2417
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:06,550
1612 that, that, that, that document
right there. So there you go. It's on,

2418
02:33:07,860 --> 02:33:08,693
they're going to fight.

2419
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:13,750
And for people wondering what Ronan is
that as a master list warrior that is a

2420
02:33:13,751 --> 02:33:16,600
Samurai without a Lord

2421
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:22,510
floating a floating person,
Nin person.

2422
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:27,340
And uh,
you could think of them in some cases.

2423
02:33:27,341 --> 02:33:31,840
I mean they would either be freelance,
self directed learners,

2424
02:33:31,990 --> 02:33:36,070
an autodidact like Musashi
or they'd be mercenaries.

2425
02:33:36,430 --> 02:33:40,840
So ruined in, we're also swords for
higher negative connotation to it.

2426
02:33:41,590 --> 02:33:43,180
Negative connotation.
God,

2427
02:33:43,270 --> 02:33:46,760
I would say for sure a
negative connotation, uh,

2428
02:33:46,810 --> 02:33:49,450
simply because,
uh,

2429
02:33:49,570 --> 02:33:52,360
the lineage and association in Japan,

2430
02:33:52,420 --> 02:33:55,140
Japanese culture is so
important that if you,

2431
02:33:55,141 --> 02:34:00,141
if you don't have a master or a particular
fif that you're associated with a

2432
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:03,640
particularly if you come from,

2433
02:34:04,020 --> 02:34:09,020
you are born of unknown origins
are from a no name at warrior.

2434
02:34:10,180 --> 02:34:13,660
It is very much a,
an important class distinction.

2435
02:34:14,680 --> 02:34:18,220
And Saki also as I understand it,

2436
02:34:19,170 --> 02:34:23,290
and this may come up later, but
used a slightly different sword. Uh,

2437
02:34:23,440 --> 02:34:25,580
and yes and

2438
02:34:25,710 --> 02:34:29,500
uh, we we can get to that. Do you want
me to hold it? No, no, it's cool. He,

2439
02:34:29,560 --> 02:34:33,310
he uses a sword called the drying pole.

2440
02:34:34,600 --> 02:34:39,430
And for years until I was actually
prepping for this podcast,

2441
02:34:40,180 --> 02:34:43,990
I thought that that was a bad
ass name for a sword of course.

2442
02:34:44,200 --> 02:34:45,970
But what I thought I
was thought to myself,

2443
02:34:45,971 --> 02:34:49,750
that means like drives you have your
blood. That's what I thought it meant.

2444
02:34:49,930 --> 02:34:51,640
It drives you have is of your blood.

2445
02:34:52,180 --> 02:34:56,170
And then as I was researching
for this podcast, it's actually,

2446
02:34:56,171 --> 02:34:59,770
and correct me if I'm wrong, but from
what I found, there's a method of Clo,

2447
02:34:59,830 --> 02:35:03,820
of drying your clothes on a stick,
a long stick,

2448
02:35:04,120 --> 02:35:06,610
and his sword was longer than most swords.

2449
02:35:06,910 --> 02:35:10,630
And so the full name of it
was the closed drawing sword.

2450
02:35:11,230 --> 02:35:12,063
Did I get all that right?

2451
02:35:13,010 --> 02:35:15,150
That part,
I'm not sure if it makes sense to me.

2452
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:19,920
And I remember when I was in
Japan a number of years ago,

2453
02:35:19,921 --> 02:35:24,060
I go back as often as I possibly can and
I'm still in close contact with my host

2454
02:35:24,061 --> 02:35:28,050
family. I've been to my brother's weddings
and so on. It's just been fantastic.

2455
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:33,950
And I went back and I went
to a Japanese Sword Museum,

2456
02:35:34,110 --> 02:35:38,640
which was incredibly hard to
find and it was empty. And the,

2457
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:43,260
I'm decent at a,
still decent at reading Japanese,

2458
02:35:43,261 --> 02:35:46,110
but it's been a long time and
it's been almost 20 years,

2459
02:35:46,290 --> 02:35:48,240
more than 20 years since
I formally studied it.

2460
02:35:48,241 --> 02:35:51,150
So given there are
thousands of characters,

2461
02:35:51,660 --> 02:35:55,920
one gets a little rusty and I went
into this Japanese sword museum and the

2462
02:35:55,921 --> 02:35:59,730
displays and everything you can imagine.
I mean it's Japan, things are clean,

2463
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:00,833
meticulous.

2464
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:05,610
And I went in and it was just walls and
walls of displays with different sorts

2465
02:36:05,611 --> 02:36:06,444
from different areas.

2466
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:11,340
So I mean swords were talking
about swords from these arrows are,

2467
02:36:11,341 --> 02:36:13,620
they're preserved and they look brand new.

2468
02:36:14,340 --> 02:36:19,340
And I was walking around and there was
a gentleman who is cleaning and I asked

2469
02:36:19,801 --> 02:36:23,340
him a question at one point about how to
pronounce a character and he proceeded

2470
02:36:23,341 --> 02:36:27,360
to pause his cleaning and walk me through
the entire museum explaining how each

2471
02:36:27,361 --> 02:36:32,250
of them was used. And one of
them, or one type I should say,

2472
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:34,410
which I believe is what Sasaki used.

2473
02:36:34,690 --> 02:36:37,440
It is long and it's called the Daci.

2474
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:42,330
I think it's Dutchy and the difference
of the most remarkable differences. A it,

2475
02:36:42,331 --> 02:36:42,571
yes,

2476
02:36:42,571 --> 02:36:47,571
it's very long and it is curved and it
would be used very often by horsemen and

2477
02:36:49,951 --> 02:36:54,300
it was curved so that
they could strike down,

2478
02:36:55,640 --> 02:37:00,030
uh, their opponents without getting
the blades stuck in their bodies.

2479
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:05,820
Because if you have a straight blade or
relatively straight played like a Katana,

2480
02:37:06,240 --> 02:37:11,130
it's almost like having a straight bladed
hatchet that you swing into a tree.

2481
02:37:11,250 --> 02:37:13,770
It's like fuck. And it gets stuck.
Well if you're on horseback,

2482
02:37:13,771 --> 02:37:16,010
that's a big problem.
You lose your sword,

2483
02:37:16,850 --> 02:37:18,990
you're in a very bad position.
And so it would,

2484
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:24,000
it would be more of a slicing motion
as opposed to a chopping motion and the

2485
02:37:24,261 --> 02:37:26,420
Daci was very effective for that reason.

2486
02:37:26,421 --> 02:37:29,080
It's also another reason that
it tended to be longer. Yeah.

2487
02:37:29,300 --> 02:37:32,480
Cause you're fighting from on top of a
horse, so you've got to reach down. Yeah.

2488
02:37:32,481 --> 02:37:37,481
Apparently they're saying that this
sword was about nine to 12 inches longer

2489
02:37:38,001 --> 02:37:41,750
than the normal sword and they gave
it this name, that drawing Paul,

2490
02:37:41,810 --> 02:37:45,890
which again I always thought was about,
that's the way my mind works.

2491
02:37:45,891 --> 02:37:49,130
Echo Charles, don't be laughing. Oh.
Then it turned out it's just trying to,

2492
02:37:49,131 --> 02:37:51,290
everything's there,
were outside on a broom handle.

2493
02:37:51,390 --> 02:37:55,700
Everything is cooler in my brain.
Uh

2494
02:37:59,140 --> 02:38:03,620
Oh two who by the way, this whole time
that she's been in and out, she's, she,

2495
02:38:03,621 --> 02:38:07,160
they've never actually
like gotten together as,

2496
02:38:07,670 --> 02:38:11,900
as whatever mates or as
permanent partners. Right.

2497
02:38:11,901 --> 02:38:16,690
It's always just been this kind
of thing. Very Japanese. Yeah. Um,

2498
02:38:16,790 --> 02:38:20,420
oh is that very Japanese?
Yeah. Yeah. I would say so.

2499
02:38:20,450 --> 02:38:25,450
Just this a very what we would consider
sort of awkward tension that never has

2500
02:38:26,561 --> 02:38:30,290
some resolution. Right then that's
then that's exactly what this is.

2501
02:38:30,480 --> 02:38:35,480
And that's exactly where they've
been for 962 pages of a book. Right.

2502
02:38:35,510 --> 02:38:39,710
Awkward tension for 962
pages and God bless her,

2503
02:38:39,711 --> 02:38:42,020
she's still like saying,
Hey, I'm here for you.

2504
02:38:42,021 --> 02:38:45,290
Even if even though he told her
I love my sword and not you.

2505
02:38:46,340 --> 02:38:50,720
Well now to be fair, he said, I love my
sort more than I love you. No, he said,

2506
02:38:50,721 --> 02:38:55,180
I don't dislike you. Which
in the Musashi speak. Yeah.

2507
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,430
It's like I will love you
until my dying. True. True.

2508
02:38:59,960 --> 02:39:04,710
So she is going to say goodbye
to him because there's, you know,

2509
02:39:04,730 --> 02:39:08,120
this is, this is, uh, does it match
where someone is going to die and it's,

2510
02:39:08,300 --> 02:39:10,760
I guess I'm looking at it,
it's a little bit,

2511
02:39:10,761 --> 02:39:15,761
the older guy that is been out of practice
against the young stud that's in the

2512
02:39:16,911 --> 02:39:17,744
game fully.

2513
02:39:18,470 --> 02:39:22,550
So it seems like people are thinking
there's a good chance he's going to die.

2514
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:27,950
So He's having that final conversation
with her. Ohsu, please forgive me.

2515
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:33,080
I may seem harmless, but I'm not,
not where you're concerned. I,

2516
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:37,430
I know that. Do you truly? Yes,

2517
02:39:37,670 --> 02:39:41,240
but I beg you say one word for me.
Just one word.

2518
02:39:41,930 --> 02:39:43,160
Tell me that I'm your wife.

2519
02:39:44,140 --> 02:39:44,690
Okay.

2520
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:48,110
It would spoil it if I told
you what you know already,

2521
02:39:49,220 --> 02:39:50,630
but,
but

2522
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:54,460
she was sobbing with her whole body,
but with a burst of strength.

2523
02:39:54,461 --> 02:39:59,260
She seized his hand and cried. Say it
Sam, your wife throughout this life,

2524
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:02,980
he nodded slowly silently.

2525
02:40:04,120 --> 02:40:08,440
Then one by one he pulled her delicate
fingers from his arm and stood erect.

2526
02:40:09,340 --> 02:40:14,340
A Samurai's wife must not weep and go to
pieces when he goes off to laugh for me

2527
02:40:14,941 --> 02:40:18,150
out to send me away with a smile.

2528
02:40:18,720 --> 02:40:20,790
This may be your husbands last departure.

2529
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:27,740
Both knew the time had
come for a brief moment.

2530
02:40:27,741 --> 02:40:32,480
He looked at her and smiled.
Then he said until then,

2531
02:40:34,010 --> 02:40:37,640
yes.
Until then she wanted to return to smile,

2532
02:40:37,641 --> 02:40:42,200
but only managed to hold back the tears.
Farewell.

2533
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:46,310
He turned and walked with firms.
Strides towards the water's edge.

2534
02:40:46,810 --> 02:40:50,240
A parting word rose to her throat,
but refuse to be uttered.

2535
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:56,200
The tears welled up irrepressibly
she could no longer see him.

2536
02:40:57,830 --> 02:41:02,780
The strong salty wind ruffled Musashi
sideburns. His Komono flapped.

2537
02:41:02,781 --> 02:41:07,010
Briskly saw Suki bring
the boat a little closer

2538
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:12,380
though. He'd been waiting for over two
hours and new Musashi was on the beach.

2539
02:41:12,580 --> 02:41:14,840
Suzuki had carefully
kept his eyes averted.

2540
02:41:15,770 --> 02:41:18,950
Now he looked at Musashi
and said right away, sir,

2541
02:41:20,060 --> 02:41:21,650
we're the few strong rapid movements.

2542
02:41:21,950 --> 02:41:24,980
He pulled the boat in
when it touched the shore.

2543
02:41:25,160 --> 02:41:28,880
Musashi jumped lightly into the
prow and they moved out to see

2544
02:41:30,770 --> 02:41:34,580
oh to stop the south.
The shout was too Taros.

2545
02:41:34,640 --> 02:41:36,050
Another guy that's there on the scene.

2546
02:41:36,520 --> 02:41:38,420
Oh two was running
straight toward the water.

2547
02:41:38,690 --> 02:41:43,280
He raced after her startled to
Suki and Osu be joined the chase.

2548
02:41:43,330 --> 02:41:47,420
Oh Sue, stop. What are you doing?
Don't be foolish. Reaching her.

2549
02:41:47,421 --> 02:41:52,370
Simultaneously they threw her arms
around her and held her back. No,

2550
02:41:52,520 --> 02:41:55,490
no, she protested. Shaking
her at Sarah had slowly,

2551
02:41:55,640 --> 02:41:58,730
you don't understand what,
what are you trying to do?

2552
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:01,520
Let me sit down by myself.

2553
02:42:02,390 --> 02:42:07,220
Her voice was calm when they released
her and she walked with dignity to a spot

2554
02:42:07,221 --> 02:42:11,150
a few yards away where she knelt
on the sand, seemingly exhausted.

2555
02:42:12,410 --> 02:42:16,040
But she had found her strength.
She straightened her color,

2556
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:21,070
smooth her hair and bowed her head
towards Musashi's little craft.

2557
02:42:22,910 --> 02:42:24,920
Go without regrets.
She said,

2558
02:42:29,970 --> 02:42:34,350
that's how you do it right there.
So again,

2559
02:42:35,100 --> 02:42:37,680
it was mentioned or if,
if I didn't explain that well enough,

2560
02:42:37,681 --> 02:42:40,740
this battle is going to take place on a
little island in the middle of a stream

2561
02:42:41,730 --> 02:42:44,670
and I'm straight. Yeah.
Or is it a straight,

2562
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:46,860
what's the difference between those two?

2563
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:52,080
Um, well actually that's a great question.
I, the way I said this, this is fun. Okay.

2564
02:42:52,081 --> 02:42:55,500
So I mean a novel like this is
created in your own head, right?

2565
02:42:55,501 --> 02:42:59,010
It's an active experience of
creating, right? So in my head,

2566
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:00,750
and maybe I don't know what a straight is,

2567
02:43:01,170 --> 02:43:05,910
but the way I envisioned a
straight was almost like a uh,

2568
02:43:06,030 --> 02:43:10,110
small or extended so long,

2569
02:43:10,111 --> 02:43:12,370
but narrow sand

2570
02:43:12,520 --> 02:43:17,520
bank in the middle of say a river or a
but a wide river like Mississippi type.

2571
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:23,200
Yeah. That's kind of what I
pictured. I pictured a wide, a wide,

2572
02:43:23,201 --> 02:43:25,370
wide river that has a,

2573
02:43:25,450 --> 02:43:29,620
a little uninhabited sorta strip of
land in the middle. Yeah, exactly.

2574
02:43:29,621 --> 02:43:31,260
That's what I picture.
And that's what you picture too.

2575
02:43:31,270 --> 02:43:33,140
So I guess we created the same thing.

2576
02:43:35,950 --> 02:43:39,490
So he's in this boat and he's headed,
obviously he's running late

2577
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:45,910
and as per usual, as per usual.
And here we go to the book.

2578
02:43:46,650 --> 02:43:50,050
So Suki may have this,
what is it?

2579
02:43:50,860 --> 02:43:55,480
This broken or in the bottom of the boat?
I don't need it.

2580
02:43:55,690 --> 02:43:59,110
Why do you want it?
It's about the right size.

2581
02:43:59,350 --> 02:44:04,350
Musashi said cryptically he held the
slightly waterlogged or out with one hand.

2582
02:44:05,411 --> 02:44:07,660
And squinted down at to
see if it was straight.

2583
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:10,930
One edge of the blade was split off.

2584
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:14,860
He placed the order on his
knee and totally absorbed,

2585
02:44:14,861 --> 02:44:16,900
began carving with his short sword.

2586
02:44:17,800 --> 02:44:22,800
Suzuki cast backward glances
toward Shimo Sechi several times,

2587
02:44:24,251 --> 02:44:27,460
but we saw, she seemed oblivious
of the people he left behind.

2588
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:32,050
Was this the way a Samurai
approached a life and death battle?

2589
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,020
Two towns,
men like Suzuki.

2590
02:44:35,740 --> 02:44:38,020
It was cold and heartless,

2591
02:44:39,490 --> 02:44:41,470
so this is important.

2592
02:44:41,471 --> 02:44:45,910
He picked up this old waterlogged or from
the bottom boat says, can I have this?

2593
02:44:45,911 --> 02:44:48,580
The guy says, yeah, sure.
And now he starts carving it.

2594
02:44:51,080 --> 02:44:54,940
So Suki was growing more and more
nervous with each stroke of the skull.

2595
02:44:55,390 --> 02:44:58,960
He had broken out in a cold sweat.
His heart was palpitating.

2596
02:44:59,170 --> 02:45:01,840
How could a man going
into battle be so calm?

2597
02:45:02,710 --> 02:45:05,560
It would be a fight to the death,
no question about that.

2598
02:45:06,190 --> 02:45:10,900
Would he be taking a passenger back to
the main land later or cruelly maimed

2599
02:45:10,901 --> 02:45:11,734
corpse?

2600
02:45:12,280 --> 02:45:16,990
There was no way of knowing Musashi
thought Suzuki was like a white cloud

2601
02:45:16,991 --> 02:45:18,370
floating across the sky.

2602
02:45:19,570 --> 02:45:23,320
This was not opposed on
Musashi's part four. In fact,

2603
02:45:23,410 --> 02:45:27,760
he was thinking of nothing
at all. He was, if anything,

2604
02:45:28,150 --> 02:45:29,110
a little bored.

2605
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:34,780
He looked over the side of the boat at
the swirling blue water. It was deep here,

2606
02:45:34,840 --> 02:45:38,230
infinitely deep and alive with
what seemed to be eternal life.

2607
02:45:39,100 --> 02:45:42,160
But water had no fixed determined form.

2608
02:45:43,480 --> 02:45:44,111
Was it not?

2609
02:45:44,111 --> 02:45:48,490
Because man had a fixed determined form
that he cannot possess eternal life.

2610
02:45:49,730 --> 02:45:50,140
Yeah.

2611
02:45:50,140 --> 02:45:55,140
Does not true life begin only when
tangible form has been lost to Musashi's

2612
02:45:56,410 --> 02:46:00,490
eyes. Life and death seemed
like so much fraud off.

2613
02:46:01,720 --> 02:46:05,350
He felt goose pimples on his skin,
not from the cold water,

2614
02:46:05,440 --> 02:46:07,630
but because his body felt a premonition.

2615
02:46:08,770 --> 02:46:13,760
Fruit though his mind had
risen above life and death,

2616
02:46:14,030 --> 02:46:14,990
body and mind.

2617
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:20,020
We're not in a accord when every
pore of his body as well of his mind.

2618
02:46:20,061 --> 02:46:20,894
For God,

2619
02:46:21,050 --> 02:46:26,050
there would remain nothing
inside but being inside is being,

2620
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:28,490
but the water and the clouds.

2621
02:46:29,780 --> 02:46:33,740
So he's going into a full on like trans.
Yeah,

2622
02:46:36,520 --> 02:46:39,530
full on. Transcend. Skipping
ahead a little bit here.

2623
02:46:40,880 --> 02:46:45,350
They arrive at the island, go straight
in Musashi, flew off the quilted quote,

2624
02:46:46,790 --> 02:46:50,620
the bow advanced at a very
restrained pace. Says you could,

2625
02:46:50,621 --> 02:46:52,640
could not bring himself
to stroke with vigor.

2626
02:46:52,760 --> 02:46:56,030
His arms moved only slightly
exerting little force.

2627
02:46:57,290 --> 02:47:02,090
The sound of Bulbous was in
the air. So Suki, yes sir.

2628
02:47:02,120 --> 02:47:04,940
It's shallow enough here.
There's no need to get close.

2629
02:47:05,270 --> 02:47:08,120
You don't want to damage your boat.
Besides,

2630
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:11,710
it's about time for the
tide to turn silent.

2631
02:47:11,711 --> 02:47:14,900
Lisa Zukie fixed his eyes on a tall,

2632
02:47:14,901 --> 02:47:18,230
thin pine tree standing alone.
Underneath it,

2633
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:21,140
the wind was playing with
a brilliant red cloak.

2634
02:47:22,440 --> 02:47:24,710
Suzuki started to point,

2635
02:47:24,740 --> 02:47:29,740
but realize that Musashi had already seen
his opponent keeping his eyes on God.

2636
02:47:29,881 --> 02:47:34,580
UNRUH Musashi took a Russet
hand towel from his Ob,

2637
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:39,790
folded it in four length wise and
tied it around his wind blown hair.

2638
02:47:41,210 --> 02:47:46,210
Then he shifted his sort of short sword
to the front of his ob taking off as

2639
02:47:46,251 --> 02:47:47,084
long sword.

2640
02:47:47,210 --> 02:47:52,210
He laid it in the bottom of the boat
and covered it with a read Matt in his

2641
02:47:52,821 --> 02:47:57,050
right hand. He held the wooden
sword he had made from the broken or

2642
02:47:58,580 --> 02:48:00,670
this is far enough. He said, this is Suki,

2643
02:48:04,690 --> 02:48:05,523
so

2644
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:11,110
he's going to fight the best
swordsman in the world. He carves a

2645
02:48:12,650 --> 02:48:17,650
wooden sword out of an or on the way
leaves his long stored in the boat and

2646
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:23,750
there is a,
this is a novel,

2647
02:48:23,780 --> 02:48:26,510
but there's also some
historic precedent for this.

2648
02:48:26,570 --> 02:48:31,570
So he would routinely use wooden swords
when dueling with opponents who are

2649
02:48:33,411 --> 02:48:34,520
using live blades.

2650
02:48:39,400 --> 02:48:44,050
Okay, back to the book at that
moment, Musashi, his Hakama,

2651
02:48:44,110 --> 02:48:48,330
which is uh, pants. They're like,
yeah, it's kind of like a judge.

2652
02:48:48,331 --> 02:48:51,580
Japanese kilt, let's say, very, very long.

2653
02:48:51,581 --> 02:48:56,470
Usually it comes down to the ankles, has
it comma hitched, high on both sides,

2654
02:48:56,471 --> 02:49:00,760
jumped lightly into the sea landing,
so light be he barely made a splash.

2655
02:49:00,970 --> 02:49:04,210
He strode rapidly toward the
waterline is a wooden sword.

2656
02:49:04,211 --> 02:49:08,370
Cutting through the spray,
five steps, 10 steps.

2657
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:14,340
Suzuki abandoning his goal, watched in
wonderment, unconscious of where he was,

2658
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:15,570
what he was doing

2659
02:49:17,070 --> 02:49:22,070
has gone rouge street away from the pine
like a red streamer has Polish scabbard

2660
02:49:22,111 --> 02:49:23,790
caught the glint of the sun.

2661
02:49:25,200 --> 02:49:27,810
Musashi gone through,

2662
02:49:28,050 --> 02:49:32,070
planted his feet and resolutely in the
sand, unwilling to give up an inch.

2663
02:49:32,940 --> 02:49:36,900
We saw, she stopped and stood, still
exposed to the water and the wind.

2664
02:49:38,190 --> 02:49:42,520
A hint of a grin appeared on his face.
[inaudible]

2665
02:49:43,110 --> 02:49:44,190
he said quietly,

2666
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:48,840
there was an unearthly fierceness
in his eyes are forced pooling.

2667
02:49:48,841 --> 02:49:50,130
So irresistibly,

2668
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:55,290
it threatened to draw Kuduro inexcusably
into the peril and destruction.

2669
02:49:56,700 --> 02:49:59,580
The waves washed his wooden sword,
gone.

2670
02:49:59,581 --> 02:50:02,280
Roos were the eyes that shot fire,

2671
02:50:03,120 --> 02:50:08,120
the bloodthirsty flame burned in his
pupils like the rainbows of fierce

2672
02:50:08,731 --> 02:50:13,731
intensity seeking to terrify
and debilitate Musashi.

2673
02:50:15,990 --> 02:50:18,990
No answer.
Musashi,

2674
02:50:20,130 --> 02:50:22,320
the sea rumbled ominously in the distance.

2675
02:50:22,590 --> 02:50:25,530
The tide lapped and murmured
at the two men's feet.

2676
02:50:26,820 --> 02:50:30,990
You're late again, aren't you? Is that
your strategy? As far as I'm concerned,

2677
02:50:31,110 --> 02:50:34,950
it's a cowardly ploy.
It's two hours past the appointed time.

2678
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:37,710
I was here at eight just as promised.
I've been waiting.

2679
02:50:39,390 --> 02:50:40,920
Musashi did not reply.

2680
02:50:42,540 --> 02:50:47,540
You did this at Ici Joji and
before that at the [inaudible].

2681
02:50:48,780 --> 02:50:52,320
Your method seems to be to throw your
opponent off by deliberately making him

2682
02:50:52,321 --> 02:50:57,000
wait. That trick will get you
nowhere. We've got Unruh now.

2683
02:50:57,001 --> 02:51:01,650
Prepare your spirit and come forward
bravely so future generations won't laugh

2684
02:51:01,651 --> 02:51:04,680
at you.
Come ahead and fight Musashi.

2685
02:51:06,090 --> 02:51:11,070
The end of his scabbard rose high behind
him as he drew the great drying pole

2686
02:51:12,390 --> 02:51:16,440
with his left hand. He slid off the
scabbard and food into the water

2687
02:51:17,940 --> 02:51:21,330
waiting just long enough for a
wave to strike the refund retreat.

2688
02:51:22,110 --> 02:51:26,270
Musashi suddenly said in a quiet voice,
you've lost code.

2689
02:51:26,271 --> 02:51:30,990
Jiro what?
Gone Rue was shaken to the core.

2690
02:51:31,320 --> 02:51:36,030
The fights been fought. I say, you've
been defeated. What are you talking about?

2691
02:51:37,050 --> 02:51:40,080
If you're going to win,
you wouldn't throw your scabbard away.

2692
02:51:40,860 --> 02:51:42,270
You've cast away your future,

2693
02:51:42,570 --> 02:51:46,500
your life words nonsense.

2694
02:51:47,550 --> 02:51:51,780
Too Bad could ready to fall.
Do you want to get it over with?

2695
02:51:51,781 --> 02:51:56,250
Fast come, come forward. You bastard.

2696
02:51:58,160 --> 02:52:02,210
Oh Musashi's cry in
the sound of the water.

2697
02:52:02,211 --> 02:52:05,980
Rose to a crescendo together
stepping into the water,

2698
02:52:06,220 --> 02:52:09,340
the drying pole position
high above his head gone.

2699
02:52:09,341 --> 02:52:14,341
Rue faced Musashi squarely align of
White Foam Street to cross the surface as

2700
02:52:15,371 --> 02:52:18,610
Musashi ran up on shore to gone,
Roos left,

2701
02:52:19,480 --> 02:52:24,480
gone root pursued Musashi's feet left the
water and touch the sand at almost the

2702
02:52:24,491 --> 02:52:27,790
same instant that gone roos sword,
his whole body.

2703
02:52:27,791 --> 02:52:32,791
Hurdled Adam like a flying fish when
Musashi sense that the drying poles coming

2704
02:52:33,431 --> 02:52:34,264
toward him.

2705
02:52:34,330 --> 02:52:38,080
His body was still at the end of the
motion that had taken him out of a water

2706
02:52:38,081 --> 02:52:39,460
leaning slightly forward.

2707
02:52:40,450 --> 02:52:45,450
He held the wooden sword with both hands
extended out to the right behind him

2708
02:52:45,730 --> 02:52:49,630
and partially hidden
satisfied with his position.

2709
02:52:50,020 --> 02:52:55,020
He grunted and almost noiseless sound
that wafted before gone years face.

2710
02:52:56,110 --> 02:52:59,350
The drying poll had appeared to be
on the verge of a downward slice,

2711
02:52:59,680 --> 02:53:02,140
but it wavered slightly then stopped

2712
02:53:03,640 --> 02:53:05,500
nine feet away from Musashi.

2713
02:53:05,710 --> 02:53:08,950
Gone route changed directions
by leaping nimbly to the right.

2714
02:53:10,450 --> 02:53:13,510
The two men stared at each other Musashi,

2715
02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:18,560
two or three paces from the
water had the c two is back gone.

2716
02:53:18,570 --> 02:53:21,850
Rue was facing him.
His sword held high with both hands.

2717
02:53:23,140 --> 02:53:28,140
Their lives were totally absorbed in
deadly combat and both were free from

2718
02:53:28,721 --> 02:53:29,770
conscious thought.

2719
02:53:31,920 --> 02:53:34,620
The scene of battle was a perfect vacuum,

2720
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:38,980
but in the waiting stations and
beyond the sound of the waves,

2721
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:42,950
countless people held
their breaths above God.

2722
02:53:42,951 --> 02:53:47,470
UNRUH hovered the prayers and the hopes
of those who believed in him and wanted

2723
02:53:47,471 --> 02:53:50,590
him to live above Musashi.

2724
02:53:51,190 --> 02:53:52,960
The prayers in hopes of others

2725
02:53:55,310 --> 02:54:00,310
of Sado and Iorio on the island of Ohsu
and Ohsu got oh Sugi and Gono Sooki on

2726
02:54:03,051 --> 02:54:06,800
the beach of academy and
Mata Hace on their hill.

2727
02:54:08,390 --> 02:54:13,190
All their prayers were directed to heaven.
Here hopes,

2728
02:54:13,400 --> 02:54:18,400
prayers and the gods were of
no assistance nor was chance.

2729
02:54:20,510 --> 02:54:25,370
There was only a vacuum in
personal and perfectly impartial

2730
02:54:27,690 --> 02:54:32,690
is this vacuum so difficult of achievement
by one who has life the perfect

2731
02:54:33,211 --> 02:54:37,740
expression of the mind that has risen
above fought and transcended ideas.

2732
02:54:39,210 --> 02:54:41,280
The two men spoke without speaking.

2733
02:54:42,330 --> 02:54:46,260
Then to each came the unconscious
realization of the other,

2734
02:54:47,850 --> 02:54:52,080
the pores of their bodies stood out
like needles directed at the adversary.

2735
02:54:53,470 --> 02:54:54,300
Okay,

2736
02:54:54,300 --> 02:54:57,030
muscles, flesh, nail hair.

2737
02:54:57,120 --> 02:55:02,120
Even I browse all bodily elements that
partake of life for United into a single

2738
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:04,490
force against the enemy,

2739
02:55:05,240 --> 02:55:08,510
defending the living organism
of which they were parked.

2740
02:55:10,180 --> 02:55:13,720
The mind alone was one with the universe,

2741
02:55:13,810 --> 02:55:17,770
clear and untroubled like the
reflection of the moon in a pond,

2742
02:55:17,771 --> 02:55:22,750
a midst the ratings of a
typhoon to reach this sublime.

2743
02:55:23,050 --> 02:55:25,990
A mobility is the supreme achievement.

2744
02:55:28,130 --> 02:55:31,710
It seemed like he [inaudible] but
the interval was in fact short.

2745
02:55:32,390 --> 02:55:37,250
The time required for the waves to come
in and recede a half a dozen times.

2746
02:55:38,750 --> 02:55:43,750
Then a great shout more than vocal coming
from the depths of being shattered.

2747
02:55:44,481 --> 02:55:49,481
The instant it came from God Unruh and
was followed immediately by Musashi

2748
02:55:50,391 --> 02:55:51,224
shout.

2749
02:55:52,380 --> 02:55:55,440
The two cries like angry waves lashing.

2750
02:55:55,441 --> 02:55:58,560
A rocky shore sent their spirits skyward.

2751
02:55:59,640 --> 02:56:04,530
The challenger Sword raised so high that
it seemed to threaten the Sun Street

2752
02:56:04,531 --> 02:56:06,420
through the air like a rainbow

2753
02:56:08,070 --> 02:56:12,360
Musashi through his shoulder,
his left shoulder forward Jew,

2754
02:56:12,361 --> 02:56:16,290
his right foot back and shifted his
upper body into position half facing his

2755
02:56:16,291 --> 02:56:20,240
opponent.
His wooden sword held in both hands,

2756
02:56:20,241 --> 02:56:24,720
swept through the air at the same moment
that the tip of the drying pole came

2757
02:56:24,721 --> 02:56:27,030
down directly before his nose.

2758
02:56:28,190 --> 02:56:28,460
Okay.

2759
02:56:28,460 --> 02:56:32,420
The breathing of the two combatants
grew louder than the sound of the waves.

2760
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:35,900
Now the wooden sword was
extended at eye level.

2761
02:56:36,470 --> 02:56:40,800
The drying pole high above it's bearers,
head gone.

2762
02:56:40,801 --> 02:56:45,530
Rwe had bounded about 10 pieces away
where you had the seed of one side.

2763
02:56:46,730 --> 02:56:50,120
Though he had not succeeded in
injuring Musashi in his first attack,

2764
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:52,400
he had put himself in
a much better position.

2765
02:56:53,420 --> 02:56:57,580
How did he remain where he was the s with
the sun reflecting from the water into

2766
02:56:57,620 --> 02:56:58,161
his eyes.

2767
02:56:58,161 --> 02:57:02,480
His vision would soon have faltered than
his spirit and he would have been at

2768
02:57:02,481 --> 02:57:07,250
Musashi's mercy
with renewed confidence gone.

2769
02:57:07,251 --> 02:57:10,420
Rue began inching forward,
keeping a sharp eye out for it,

2770
02:57:10,421 --> 02:57:15,110
Chink and Musashi's defense and stealing
his own spirit for a decisive move.

2771
02:57:17,390 --> 02:57:19,310
Musashi did the unexpected.

2772
02:57:20,290 --> 02:57:20,710
Yeah.

2773
02:57:20,710 --> 02:57:23,530
Instead of proceeding
slowly and cautiously,

2774
02:57:23,650 --> 02:57:26,350
he strode bold boldly toward gone.

2775
02:57:26,351 --> 02:57:30,550
Rouge has soared projecting before
him ready to thrust into gone years.

2776
02:57:30,580 --> 02:57:34,960
Eyes be artlessness of this approach.

2777
02:57:35,170 --> 02:57:39,100
Brock gone route to a halt.
He almost lost sight of Musashi,

2778
02:57:40,360 --> 02:57:44,590
the wooden sword row straight
in the air with one great kick.

2779
02:57:44,591 --> 02:57:49,591
Musashi leapt high and folding his legs
reduced his six foot frame to four feet

2780
02:57:50,291 --> 02:57:51,130
or less.

2781
02:57:52,120 --> 02:57:52,730
Okay.

2782
02:57:52,730 --> 02:57:56,600
Yeah. God, Woo stored. Scream
through the space above him.

2783
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:00,440
The stroke missed,
but the tip of the drying,

2784
02:58:00,441 --> 02:58:04,860
Paul cut through Musashi's headband,
which went flying through the air.

2785
02:58:05,820 --> 02:58:06,340
Yeah.

2786
02:58:06,340 --> 02:58:11,340
Gone Rouge mistook it for his opponents
head and to smile flooded briefly across

2787
02:58:12,731 --> 02:58:13,630
his face.

2788
02:58:15,940 --> 02:58:20,940
The next instant his skull broke like
gravel under the blow of Musashi Sword.

2789
02:58:24,610 --> 02:58:25,443
Yeah.

2790
02:58:25,530 --> 02:58:28,590
Has Gone Rue lay with a sand,
met the grass.

2791
02:58:29,550 --> 02:58:32,340
His face betrayed no
consciousness of defeat.

2792
02:58:34,450 --> 02:58:36,250
Bloodstream from his mouth.

2793
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:37,180
Yeah,

2794
02:58:37,180 --> 02:58:40,660
but his lips form the smile of triumph.

2795
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:44,870
Oh No,
gone through.

2796
02:58:45,940 --> 02:58:46,430
Yeah.

2797
02:58:46,430 --> 02:58:47,600
For getting himself.

2798
02:58:48,280 --> 02:58:53,280
You warm a Kabuki chumped up and with
him all his knew their faces distorted

2799
02:58:55,751 --> 02:58:56,584
with shock.

2800
02:58:57,970 --> 02:59:02,890
Then they saw the Goda Sabu and EERE
sitting calmly and sedately on their

2801
02:59:02,891 --> 02:59:07,810
benches. Shamed. They somehow
managed to keep from running forward.

2802
02:59:08,680 --> 02:59:08,970
Yeah.

2803
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:11,280
They tried to regain
a degree of composure,

2804
02:59:11,430 --> 02:59:14,040
but there was no concealing
their grief and delusion.

2805
02:59:15,280 --> 02:59:15,940
Okay.

2806
02:59:15,940 --> 02:59:17,140
Some swallowed hard,

2807
02:59:17,141 --> 02:59:20,950
refusing to believe what they had
seen and their mind's went blank

2808
02:59:22,730 --> 02:59:26,680
in an instant. The island was quiet
and still as it had ever been,

2809
02:59:27,730 --> 02:59:32,080
only the rustle of the Pines and the
swing grasses mocked the frailty.

2810
02:59:32,440 --> 02:59:34,600
And the impermanence of mankind.

2811
02:59:36,830 --> 02:59:39,500
Musashi was watching a
small cloud in the sky

2812
02:59:41,490 --> 02:59:46,490
as he did his soul return to his body
and it became possible for him to

2813
02:59:47,191 --> 02:59:52,191
distinguish between the cloud and himself
between his body and the universe.

2814
02:59:56,840 --> 02:59:59,100
Sasaki could Jiro gone.

2815
02:59:59,101 --> 03:00:01,850
Rouge did not return to
the world of the living

2816
03:00:03,650 --> 03:00:04,880
lying face down.

2817
03:00:05,090 --> 03:00:10,000
He still had a grip on his sword
is tenacity was still visible.

2818
03:00:11,080 --> 03:00:13,510
There was no sign of anguish on his face.

2819
03:00:14,350 --> 03:00:14,940
Okay.

2820
03:00:14,940 --> 03:00:18,450
Nothing but satisfaction at
having fought a good fight,

2821
03:00:18,870 --> 03:00:20,880
not the faintest shadow of regret.

2822
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:27,720
The site of his own headband lying on
the ground sent shivers up and down

2823
03:00:27,721 --> 03:00:28,920
Musashi spine.

2824
03:00:30,930 --> 03:00:35,430
Never in this life he thought would
he meet another opponent like this?

2825
03:00:37,200 --> 03:00:40,350
A wave of admiration and
respect float over him.

2826
03:00:41,790 --> 03:00:45,840
He was grateful to [inaudible]
for what the man had given him

2827
03:00:47,340 --> 03:00:49,770
in strength in the will to fight.

2828
03:00:49,771 --> 03:00:54,771
He ranked higher than Musashi and it was
because of this that Musashi had been

2829
03:00:55,851 --> 03:00:57,710
forced to excel himself.

2830
03:01:00,510 --> 03:01:04,050
What was it that it enabled
Musashi do to defeat?

2831
03:01:04,170 --> 03:01:09,150
Cause she could Jiro skill,
the help of the gods,

2832
03:01:10,490 --> 03:01:14,690
while knowing it was neither of these
Musashi was never able to express a reason

2833
03:01:14,691 --> 03:01:15,620
in wards,

2834
03:01:16,700 --> 03:01:20,720
certainly was something more important
than either strength or godly.

2835
03:01:20,721 --> 03:01:25,721
Providence Koichiro had put his confidence
in the sword of strength and skill.

2836
03:01:29,840 --> 03:01:32,210
Musashi trusted in this sort of spirit.

2837
03:01:33,620 --> 03:01:33,910
Okay.

2838
03:01:33,910 --> 03:01:35,890
That was the only difference between them

2839
03:01:38,170 --> 03:01:43,000
silently. Musashi walked the 10
paces to Kuduro and knelt beside him.

2840
03:01:44,700 --> 03:01:49,230
He put his left hand near the nostrils
of could euro and found there was no

2841
03:01:49,231 --> 03:01:53,570
trace of breath
with the right treatment.

2842
03:01:53,571 --> 03:01:54,500
He may recover.

2843
03:01:55,220 --> 03:01:59,530
Musashi told himself and
he wanted to believe this,

2844
03:02:00,340 --> 03:02:04,990
wanted to believe that this Moza Vallian
of all adversaries would be spared,

2845
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:09,140
but the battle was over.

2846
03:02:10,270 --> 03:02:10,810
Okay?

2847
03:02:10,810 --> 03:02:14,460
It was time to go
farewell.

2848
03:02:14,490 --> 03:02:18,870
He said to [inaudible] then to the
officials on their beat benches,

2849
03:02:20,200 --> 03:02:24,820
having bowed wants to the ground. He ran
to the reef and jumped into the boat.

2850
03:02:26,140 --> 03:02:28,540
There was not a drop of
blood on his wooden sword.

2851
03:02:29,840 --> 03:02:31,820
The tiny craft moved out to sea.

2852
03:02:32,690 --> 03:02:33,070
Okay.

2853
03:02:33,070 --> 03:02:38,070
Who's to say where there is no record as
to whether gone rue supporters on Hiko

2854
03:02:39,400 --> 03:02:41,410
Jima attempted to take revenge.

2855
03:02:43,320 --> 03:02:44,080
Okay.

2856
03:02:44,080 --> 03:02:48,850
People do not give up their loves
and hates as long as life lasts.

2857
03:02:50,100 --> 03:02:53,580
Waves of feeling come and
go with the passage of time.

2858
03:02:54,930 --> 03:02:55,180
Okay.

2859
03:02:55,180 --> 03:02:56,770
Throughout Musashi's lifetime,

2860
03:02:57,010 --> 03:03:02,010
there were those who resented his victory
and criticized his conduct on that

2861
03:03:02,710 --> 03:03:05,420
day.
He rushed away.

2862
03:03:05,630 --> 03:03:10,040
It was said because he feared reprisal.
He was confused.

2863
03:03:11,210 --> 03:03:14,600
He even neglected to
administer the coup de Gras.

2864
03:03:16,230 --> 03:03:17,063
Yeah.

2865
03:03:17,310 --> 03:03:21,630
The world is always full
of the sound of waves.

2866
03:03:23,670 --> 03:03:28,670
The little fishes abandoning
themselves to the waves,

2867
03:03:29,250 --> 03:03:31,770
dance and sing and play.

2868
03:03:33,360 --> 03:03:36,660
But who knows the heart of
the sea a hundred feet down.

2869
03:03:38,830 --> 03:03:40,840
Who knows?
It's depth.

2870
03:03:49,940 --> 03:03:50,773
The end.

2871
03:03:55,100 --> 03:03:55,933
That is

2872
03:03:58,090 --> 03:03:59,390
how the book finishes up.

2873
03:04:04,320 --> 03:04:05,820
Who knows the heart of the sea,

2874
03:04:10,570 --> 03:04:12,220
who knows its depths.

2875
03:04:20,010 --> 03:04:24,600
And as I read that,
I wondered to myself,

2876
03:04:28,810 --> 03:04:30,640
are we just the little fishes?

2877
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:32,760
Yeah.

2878
03:04:32,760 --> 03:04:37,260
Abandoning ourselves to
the waves to sing and dance

2879
03:04:38,970 --> 03:04:39,803
and play.

2880
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:45,480
Is that what we're doing?

2881
03:04:47,620 --> 03:04:49,570
And I'm not saying don't have fun.

2882
03:04:50,170 --> 03:04:52,870
I'm not saying don't
sing and dance and play.

2883
03:04:53,680 --> 03:04:58,180
Enjoy life of course.
And relish the joy of life.

2884
03:05:01,180 --> 03:05:03,940
But I think you have to make sure
you don't dance your life away.

2885
03:05:07,000 --> 03:05:07,833
Yeah,

2886
03:05:08,060 --> 03:05:10,820
don't be one of the little fishes.

2887
03:05:14,420 --> 03:05:19,420
And in Docauto that final writing
of Masashi before he died,

2888
03:05:21,650 --> 03:05:22,940
the last thing he wrote,

2889
03:05:24,100 --> 03:05:24,720
okay,

2890
03:05:24,720 --> 03:05:27,480
was never stray from the way.

2891
03:05:31,290 --> 03:05:36,290
And I think that that's
what this is about.

2892
03:05:39,520 --> 03:05:43,780
All the fun and the singing and the
dancing and hold the play. It's okay,

2893
03:05:46,190 --> 03:05:47,023
it's good.

2894
03:05:51,040 --> 03:05:55,870
But all those things
can be distractions

2895
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:03,450
because there is a path,
there is a way,

2896
03:06:07,300 --> 03:06:10,750
and you know what that way is,

2897
03:06:10,751 --> 03:06:13,330
you know what you should be doing.

2898
03:06:17,120 --> 03:06:22,120
And it's hard to stay on that path
because it is the path of discipline

2899
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:29,170
and discomfort,
but it is the right path.

2900
03:06:29,800 --> 03:06:31,030
And did you know that?

2901
03:06:35,580 --> 03:06:40,580
And it is that path that will ultimately
lead you to where you really want to be

2902
03:06:46,060 --> 03:06:48,560
so that you can live

2903
03:06:53,230 --> 03:06:54,430
and you can die

2904
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:00,340
without regrets.

2905
03:07:04,720 --> 03:07:05,980
I think a lot of times,

2906
03:07:07,040 --> 03:07:07,873
okay,

2907
03:07:07,940 --> 03:07:12,940
people are trying to find the path and
they're looking all around different

2908
03:07:13,851 --> 03:07:18,290
places and different people in
different influences. But man,

2909
03:07:18,291 --> 03:07:19,930
I think so often that path.

2910
03:07:19,931 --> 03:07:24,110
Do you know what the path is and people
know what they're supposed to be doing,

2911
03:07:24,111 --> 03:07:27,560
but they just don't get on
the path and stay on the path.

2912
03:07:28,410 --> 03:07:32,610
Yeah, I agree. Word, something they
felt when they were eight or 12,

2913
03:07:33,510 --> 03:07:38,510
and they s they traveled the world or
travel through life's experiences trying

2914
03:07:39,571 --> 03:07:42,030
to find the answer that was in
front of them the entire time.

2915
03:07:42,950 --> 03:07:47,950
And so they come back to see what they
knew with different eyes and to recognize

2916
03:07:49,111 --> 03:07:52,740
that they knew the path all along,
which is something that,

2917
03:07:53,950 --> 03:07:54,620
uh,

2918
03:07:54,620 --> 03:07:59,620
I so enjoyed about this
book and the character both
real and certainly presented

2919
03:08:01,741 --> 03:08:06,741
by the author of Musashi who is using
his experiences in this domain of the

2920
03:08:08,281 --> 03:08:13,281
sword as a means of a
thematic interconnectedness.

2921
03:08:16,130 --> 03:08:19,590
And so unlike sus, uh, Cojito at the end,

2922
03:08:20,480 --> 03:08:23,550
he is not just a
technician with the sword,

2923
03:08:23,590 --> 03:08:27,870
although he is a brilliant technician.
He's tilling the soil,

2924
03:08:27,900 --> 03:08:32,640
he's constructing buildings,
which later he did quite a lot of,

2925
03:08:32,750 --> 03:08:33,150
uh,

2926
03:08:33,150 --> 03:08:37,710
in terms of architecture and overseeing
the building instead of destruction of

2927
03:08:37,711 --> 03:08:42,711
things and finding at the highest
levels of performance with the sword in

2928
03:08:45,090 --> 03:08:48,270
felling opponents, the, the principles,

2929
03:08:48,271 --> 03:08:51,300
the first principles that
he can apply everywhere.

2930
03:08:52,470 --> 03:08:57,470
And that's part of what fascinates me so
much about Musashi or anyone who's the

2931
03:08:57,481 --> 03:09:01,920
best at what they do is that it could
be anything. It could be pottery,

2932
03:09:01,950 --> 03:09:05,040
it could be sniping,
it could be calligraphy,

2933
03:09:05,041 --> 03:09:09,450
but like the best they see the depth,

2934
03:09:10,830 --> 03:09:12,230
they see the,
uh,

2935
03:09:13,010 --> 03:09:13,570
yeah,

2936
03:09:13,570 --> 03:09:18,570
the interwoven web is that can expand
from that one fine focus into everything

2937
03:09:19,391 --> 03:09:20,080
that they do.

2938
03:09:20,080 --> 03:09:25,080
And I think of that for
me at least is the path,

2939
03:09:25,810 --> 03:09:29,200
and maybe it's just coming off of a silent
retreat that I want to talk this way,

2940
03:09:29,201 --> 03:09:34,201
but it doesn't strike me as something
that is cleanly expressed in an Instagram

2941
03:09:35,320 --> 03:09:39,640
post or a quote necessarily.
It's more of a feeling like,

2942
03:09:39,641 --> 03:09:40,570
you know,

2943
03:09:41,410 --> 03:09:42,050
okay,

2944
03:09:42,050 --> 03:09:47,050
if you're sober and take a moment to
sit in the stillness and that stillness,

2945
03:09:47,930 --> 03:09:49,970
I don't mean sitting on a mountain top,
it could just be

2946
03:09:51,830 --> 03:09:53,210
five minutes of silence.

2947
03:09:53,320 --> 03:09:58,030
You first get up in the
morning and observe your own
mind and how you feel like

2948
03:09:58,060 --> 03:10:01,990
you know if you're on the path or not.
Or at least you know when you're not

2949
03:10:03,730 --> 03:10:06,130
totally agree. You know, you
know when you're not on it.

2950
03:10:06,610 --> 03:10:11,610
And I think that the feeling of
being on it when you're on the path,

2951
03:10:12,160 --> 03:10:15,160
it has that beauty of

2952
03:10:17,440 --> 03:10:22,440
mindlessness or no mind is
what they would say in say zen.

2953
03:10:22,840 --> 03:10:27,040
The state of no mind, and it sounds
like unconscious, but it's different.

2954
03:10:27,041 --> 03:10:29,020
It's not unconscious,
it's not subconscious.

2955
03:10:29,021 --> 03:10:34,021
It's something else where you feel that
you are exactly where you should be

2956
03:10:34,540 --> 03:10:38,140
doing exactly what you should be
doing and you're not planning,

2957
03:10:38,770 --> 03:10:43,420
you're just putting one foot in front of
the other on this path that you didn't

2958
03:10:43,421 --> 03:10:47,830
have to find it because in a way the
path was seeking you the whole time.

2959
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:50,950
And it's just a feeling.
It's a really,

2960
03:10:52,480 --> 03:10:55,990
it's a feeling I think
that everyone can have,

2961
03:10:56,020 --> 03:10:58,780
but they get so caught up,
we all get caught up.

2962
03:10:58,781 --> 03:11:01,930
I don't want to speak for you to
find, so I'll speak for myself. It's,

2963
03:11:01,931 --> 03:11:04,360
it's easy to get caught up in the noise,

2964
03:11:04,390 --> 03:11:09,390
in the shiny objects and just like
the little fish you were talking about

2965
03:11:09,971 --> 03:11:13,180
earlier,
it's like what you see that lure

2966
03:11:14,890 --> 03:11:18,550
to recognize it as a lure
is sort of the first step.

2967
03:11:19,330 --> 03:11:22,600
And then to realize that when you
look past the lure, all right,

2968
03:11:22,601 --> 03:11:26,350
there's a lure 16 inches in front of
you and then you're in an ocean that has

2969
03:11:26,740 --> 03:11:28,330
endless fathoms of death.

2970
03:11:32,100 --> 03:11:34,950
What a journey. Yeah. I the same,

2971
03:11:35,110 --> 03:11:40,110
the line that says the world is
always filled with the sound of waves.

2972
03:11:40,530 --> 03:11:41,220
It's like,
yeah,

2973
03:11:41,220 --> 03:11:45,270
those sounds are going on and the waves
are out there and there's little fishies

2974
03:11:45,271 --> 03:11:46,680
swimming around in the waves.

2975
03:11:49,870 --> 03:11:54,140
You, and I think you've
experienced this type of,

2976
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:58,260
that type of clarity in
many different contexts. Uh,

2977
03:11:58,310 --> 03:12:01,310
I haven't surfed much,
but I have done a bit,

2978
03:12:01,311 --> 03:12:02,990
certainly not as regularly as you have,

2979
03:12:02,991 --> 03:12:07,991
but the feeling of when I've been
out in surf that suddenly exceeded my

2980
03:12:10,491 --> 03:12:11,324
capacities,

2981
03:12:13,160 --> 03:12:15,740
which is also not necessarily
something I recommend,

2982
03:12:15,770 --> 03:12:18,380
but I've had this harrowing experience,

2983
03:12:18,381 --> 03:12:20,930
particularly as someone who didn't
learn to swim until I was in my thirties

2984
03:12:20,931 --> 03:12:24,950
which is a whole separate thing that
I think we covered in episode 50.

2985
03:12:26,840 --> 03:12:31,070
I have fear related to the ocean,
which I think is healthy on,

2986
03:12:31,110 --> 03:12:32,240
on a lot of levels.

2987
03:12:32,840 --> 03:12:37,840
When you're out there and suddenly sets
come in that are 70% of 102% bigger than

2988
03:12:39,351 --> 03:12:42,230
what you went in with the feeling of,

2989
03:12:43,220 --> 03:12:47,390
or just sitting calmly on your board
waiting for a set and looking out over the

2990
03:12:47,391 --> 03:12:47,721
water.

2991
03:12:47,721 --> 03:12:52,640
The sense of insignificance
that you feel is not a,

2992
03:12:52,970 --> 03:12:56,480
at least that I feel.
It's not a negative thing.

2993
03:12:57,530 --> 03:13:02,130
It's a very, uh, hesitate to use the word,

2994
03:13:02,131 --> 03:13:06,030
but I can't find a better one spiritual
experience where you're like, oh yeah,

2995
03:13:06,810 --> 03:13:10,530
that email,
that comment on social media,

2996
03:13:11,970 --> 03:13:15,180
that commitment I made to go to an event
that I run now really six months later,

2997
03:13:15,181 --> 03:13:18,000
don't want to go to who gives a fuck?

2998
03:13:18,600 --> 03:13:22,110
It's like we're a bunch of monkeys on
a spinning rock in the middle of this

2999
03:13:22,111 --> 03:13:23,880
whole thing.
Whatever this whole thing is.

3000
03:13:23,970 --> 03:13:26,610
And all that thing is singing
and dancing and playing it.

3001
03:13:26,611 --> 03:13:30,780
It's like compared to the depths of
the ocean, it means nothing. Yeah.

3002
03:13:31,170 --> 03:13:34,780
I think, yeah, it's, it's, uh,

3003
03:13:35,640 --> 03:13:36,473
it's,

3004
03:13:39,390 --> 03:13:43,750
I just, I love the purity of, uh,

3005
03:13:44,310 --> 03:13:47,790
despite his stupidity, let's be honest.
Right? We already talked about it. Like,

3006
03:13:47,791 --> 03:13:52,470
he made us a lot of stupid decisions.
Storming the jail. I mean, what do you,

3007
03:13:52,830 --> 03:13:56,670
what do you think's going to happen? And
so on and so forth. Despite all that,

3008
03:13:56,671 --> 03:14:01,350
coming back to what he knew,

3009
03:14:01,440 --> 03:14:05,280
one of the few things that he felt, I
shouldn't say no, felt to be true to him,

3010
03:14:05,281 --> 03:14:07,440
which was this commitment
to the way of the sword.

3011
03:14:07,630 --> 03:14:09,640
And it doesn't have to be a
commitment to the way of the sword,

3012
03:14:09,660 --> 03:14:13,260
but I've always had a certain envy,
uh,

3013
03:14:13,530 --> 03:14:16,020
for people including yourself,
who from a very,

3014
03:14:16,021 --> 03:14:19,860
very early age just felt

3015
03:14:21,080 --> 03:14:21,700
okay.

3016
03:14:21,700 --> 03:14:26,020
Ebay beacon for a direction that
called them. Yeah, really lucky.

3017
03:14:26,080 --> 03:14:29,680
I feel like I was really lucky in
that aspect where you meet people.

3018
03:14:29,710 --> 03:14:33,310
I've met for instance, Laird Hamilton,
I mentioned him earlier. He's like,

3019
03:14:33,311 --> 03:14:37,150
he still surfs every day,
wakes up at four,

3020
03:14:37,160 --> 03:14:41,590
stoked to go out and train
and uh,

3021
03:14:42,220 --> 03:14:46,030
he's on the path.
He's on the path and I mean this is a guy

3022
03:14:47,900 --> 03:14:48,733
who

3023
03:14:49,850 --> 03:14:53,630
he was with, I mean he's out
there with large tiger sharks,

3024
03:14:53,631 --> 03:14:56,720
which are routinely out
where he surfs in Hawaii,

3025
03:14:57,050 --> 03:15:00,020
where he spends a good portion of the
year and I've heard stories and these are

3026
03:15:00,021 --> 03:15:03,340
real,
these are not several hundred years later.

3027
03:15:03,341 --> 03:15:07,760
And Baelish storage is a real stories
where someone was bitten by a tiger shark

3028
03:15:07,761 --> 03:15:12,750
bleeding out. He went back
to a jet ski, they had a, Oh,

3029
03:15:12,751 --> 03:15:14,780
it took off at some piece of clothing.

3030
03:15:14,781 --> 03:15:19,781
He had put in makeshift tourniquet on
this guy who's bleeding in the water with

3031
03:15:20,391 --> 03:15:22,190
tiger sharks. Keep, mine's
already been bitten.

3032
03:15:23,390 --> 03:15:26,180
The key has been lost to
the jet ski hot wires,

3033
03:15:26,181 --> 03:15:29,520
the Jet Ski and brings the
Guy Back and saves them and,

3034
03:15:29,560 --> 03:15:34,160
and I'd say every few months he saved
someone's life in the water and he's in

3035
03:15:34,161 --> 03:15:39,080
his 50s and you're sitting in a,
in a steam room at one point.

3036
03:15:39,350 --> 03:15:41,640
And uh, I, I,

3037
03:15:41,790 --> 03:15:45,680
I in retrospect realized not a good idea
to try to outlast layered and the steam

3038
03:15:45,681 --> 03:15:50,280
room, but he was saying roughly
along these lines, like 20

3039
03:15:50,280 --> 03:15:54,960
once it's 20 feet, you can start to
have fun. Start to play around. He goes

3040
03:15:56,490 --> 03:15:59,070
20 to 20 to 30. Yeah,
you're really jamming.

3041
03:15:59,300 --> 03:16:04,300
It's like 30 to 40 you can definitely
get into the zone and he's like above 50

3042
03:16:04,501 --> 03:16:05,430
are not allowed to fall.

3043
03:16:07,230 --> 03:16:10,680
And that's his day and he has kids.

3044
03:16:11,070 --> 03:16:13,890
But as far as I can tell,
Gabby, who's just incredible,

3045
03:16:13,891 --> 03:16:15,900
incredible on so many
levels in her own right,

3046
03:16:16,890 --> 03:16:18,990
she understands like this is his path.

3047
03:16:19,020 --> 03:16:23,970
He's still chasing giants and he's
not going to stop. How could he,

3048
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:26,100
like that's part of who he is.

3049
03:16:27,060 --> 03:16:32,060
What do you think draws people like
in the wrong direction in their life?

3050
03:16:32,810 --> 03:16:35,490
I think it's just a little
distractions as you talk about.

3051
03:16:35,560 --> 03:16:38,040
It's a little distractions,
little things that just

3052
03:16:39,870 --> 03:16:41,700
pull you off.
And I think,

3053
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:46,350
I think maybe people don't want to accept
the fact like they know what the path

3054
03:16:46,351 --> 03:16:51,060
is, but they want to deny it for what?
For whatever reason. Like I think that's,

3055
03:16:51,090 --> 03:16:54,450
I think that can be part of it. Uh, the,

3056
03:16:55,110 --> 03:16:58,770
the distraction of the path.
I mean,

3057
03:16:59,280 --> 03:17:03,210
I will say for those people out there
who were like, oh, for God's sake,

3058
03:17:03,211 --> 03:17:06,750
like I don't know what my path is. I
can't define it. I don't know if I could,

3059
03:17:06,960 --> 03:17:11,670
if I could say to someone
with absolute conviction,

3060
03:17:11,910 --> 03:17:16,350
my path is x,
but I can tell when I've strayed,

3061
03:17:16,740 --> 03:17:19,230
if that makes sense.
There's a certain agitation,

3062
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:24,500
there's a certain scattered feeling that
I have and as to reasons people get off

3063
03:17:29,310 --> 03:17:32,910
the path. And I think people may have
multiple paths, but you are going to say,

3064
03:17:33,010 --> 03:17:34,590
I was going to say,
because I've been,

3065
03:17:34,750 --> 03:17:39,750
I'm trying to formulate what what we're
talking about because I know exactly

3066
03:17:39,811 --> 03:17:43,230
what you mean. Like like the
path is, it might not be like,

3067
03:17:43,231 --> 03:17:47,370
Hey I want to do this thing. Like there's
something else and, and I think it,

3068
03:17:47,430 --> 03:17:49,080
I think there's something else is

3069
03:17:51,060 --> 03:17:54,980
the path is how you are going to live.
Yeah.

3070
03:17:55,420 --> 03:17:57,720
That's not necessarily a
destination that you could,

3071
03:17:57,721 --> 03:18:01,560
you could follow the same path and get
to a bunch of different destinations,

3072
03:18:01,561 --> 03:18:04,050
but the path itself of
how you're going to live,

3073
03:18:04,230 --> 03:18:08,310
how you're going to go through life,
how you're going to do things,

3074
03:18:08,850 --> 03:18:10,830
that's,
that's what I'm talking about.

3075
03:18:10,860 --> 03:18:15,860
And even the path that I'm on could have
led to other things and in my life and

3076
03:18:16,230 --> 03:18:18,540
even though you know,
I was in the military for 20 years,

3077
03:18:19,050 --> 03:18:22,260
I'm not in the military anymore,
I'm still on the same path.

3078
03:18:22,290 --> 03:18:27,270
Like the path is the same of the way I'm
trying to live my life. That's the same.

3079
03:18:27,510 --> 03:18:31,650
And if I'm in, when I'm in business,
the way I, the way I run my business,

3080
03:18:31,651 --> 03:18:35,280
I'm Trump. I'm just on the
same path. It's the path.

3081
03:18:35,520 --> 03:18:38,430
It's like the way you're living
your life more than anything else.

3082
03:18:38,431 --> 03:18:41,490
And it doesn't matter if you're in
college, if you're starting a business,

3083
03:18:41,491 --> 03:18:43,380
if you're working for someone,

3084
03:18:44,250 --> 03:18:48,070
are you on the path that you're supposed
to be on? Are you living the way that

3085
03:18:48,070 --> 03:18:51,100
you feel you're supposed to live,
that you know you're supposed to live?

3086
03:18:51,700 --> 03:18:52,870
I think people get off that.

3087
03:18:53,110 --> 03:18:56,380
They get off that and then not living
the way that they know they should live,

3088
03:18:57,070 --> 03:19:00,310
regardless of circumstances. You've been
in horrible circumstances before we all,

3089
03:19:00,311 --> 03:19:05,311
we all go in situations where
things just went sideways and,

3090
03:19:05,450 --> 03:19:09,820
and you can either have stray off the
path and turn into something that you're

3091
03:19:09,821 --> 03:19:13,930
not, or something that you know you
shouldn't be or you can stay on the path.

3092
03:19:14,050 --> 03:19:19,050
You can continue to do the things that
you're supposed to do and do and live the

3093
03:19:19,091 --> 03:19:22,180
way that you want to live.
And really lately I've been talking about,

3094
03:19:22,181 --> 03:19:23,710
because I've been trying to explain this,

3095
03:19:25,890 --> 03:19:28,150
you know what the right thing to do is,
right?

3096
03:19:28,151 --> 03:19:31,750
You know what you're supposed
to do as a person, as you,

3097
03:19:31,780 --> 03:19:36,130
you know what you're supposed
to do. Do it, do that thing.

3098
03:19:36,190 --> 03:19:37,990
What is that thing that you spent?
You know,

3099
03:19:37,991 --> 03:19:41,800
you're supposed to live a certain way.
And, and when you don't live that way,

3100
03:19:42,190 --> 03:19:43,060
like you said,
there's,

3101
03:19:43,090 --> 03:19:46,690
there's friction and there's tension and
there's disruption and it doesn't feel

3102
03:19:46,691 --> 03:19:48,910
right. And when you live the
right way, it's often harder.

3103
03:19:49,120 --> 03:19:53,320
It often is less immediate gratification,
but the,

3104
03:19:53,560 --> 03:19:57,640
but the internal gratification that you
get from living the way you're supposed

3105
03:19:57,641 --> 03:20:00,580
to live is very satisfying.

3106
03:20:01,060 --> 03:20:06,060
And another thing I need to absolutely
point out is I am by no means sitting

3107
03:20:07,871 --> 03:20:12,871
here trying to say that I've always
maintained the worst human ever.

3108
03:20:13,871 --> 03:20:16,650
I'm horrible. And, and
you know, I was on with a,

3109
03:20:16,840 --> 03:20:21,070
with a guy named Charlie plumb came
on the podcast and a guy named Jim Jim

3110
03:20:21,070 --> 03:20:24,490
Conkle. Charlie plumb was a Vietnam,
uh, fighter pilot shot down,

3111
03:20:24,491 --> 03:20:26,800
spent six years in the Hanoi Hilton.

3112
03:20:27,220 --> 03:20:31,030
And another guy named Jim [inaudible]
uncle who was a fighter pilot in World War

3113
03:20:31,030 --> 03:20:35,440
II. And, and we got in this conversation
like about, you know, doing good and,

3114
03:20:35,530 --> 03:20:39,040
and these guys are just levels,

3115
03:20:39,100 --> 03:20:42,760
infinite levels above me as
far as being good people. And,

3116
03:20:42,860 --> 03:20:46,670
and I kind of went along
with the conversation almost
as if I was one of their

3117
03:20:46,710 --> 03:20:51,460
like had that level of goodness, which
I don't, you know, I mean I'm trying,

3118
03:20:51,670 --> 03:20:56,200
but you know, when I was a young
seal has a maniac, you know,

3119
03:20:56,201 --> 03:21:00,610
I made Musashi looked like
a brilliant saint when his
youth, you know, I was like,

3120
03:21:00,611 --> 03:21:05,611
how are easy maniac kid filled
with just mayhem in my brain and,

3121
03:21:06,330 --> 03:21:10,330
and all my friends, we were all the same
and we got after it. And so believe me,

3122
03:21:10,331 --> 03:21:15,040
I'm not trying to say that, but I
will say that as I've grown up, I've,

3123
03:21:15,130 --> 03:21:19,420
I've think I've gotten myself closer to
living the way that I know I'm supposed

3124
03:21:19,421 --> 03:21:23,020
to live or I the what I believe to be the
right way and the right path to be on.

3125
03:21:23,440 --> 03:21:24,460
And you know,

3126
03:21:24,461 --> 03:21:28,780
so I just wanted to make that quick caveat
that anybody that's listening that's

3127
03:21:28,781 --> 03:21:32,410
like, Oh wow, jack was really
just a saintly person. Go wrong.

3128
03:21:32,710 --> 03:21:36,580
I'm not even remotely making that claim.
Um,

3129
03:21:36,940 --> 03:21:40,060
but I am trying, I'll give
myself at least that much credit.

3130
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:45,040
I think that everyone is
a work in progress and

3131
03:21:46,850 --> 03:21:49,880
the path so to speak is

3132
03:21:50,850 --> 03:21:51,540
okay

3133
03:21:51,540 --> 03:21:56,130
illustrated for me in this book and I'll,
I'll get into a couple of specifics.

3134
03:21:56,131 --> 03:21:59,310
It might be helpful for people to think
about or at least had been helpful to me

3135
03:21:59,311 --> 03:22:00,420
as I think through

3136
03:22:01,980 --> 03:22:06,980
what distinguishes the relative lack
of friction and the scatteredness and

3137
03:22:11,251 --> 03:22:14,670
agitation versus states
without those things.

3138
03:22:15,000 --> 03:22:20,000
Because being on the path
is not necessarily for me
a feeling of overwhelming

3139
03:22:20,400 --> 03:22:25,050
joy and happiness per se.

3140
03:22:25,260 --> 03:22:27,390
It's,
it's a lack of

3141
03:22:29,580 --> 03:22:34,580
excess agitation and distractedness
and I think that what,

3142
03:22:36,390 --> 03:22:41,390
what I've found for myself is that as
I get older and feel more at peace with

3143
03:22:42,001 --> 03:22:45,740
what I'm doing and how I'm
behaving, like you said, it's,

3144
03:22:45,800 --> 03:22:50,800
it's having certain first principles in
mind that transcend any given project,

3145
03:22:52,470 --> 03:22:56,820
any given conversation, anyone
relationship. And early on, it's

3146
03:22:58,500 --> 03:23:03,450
as you're hoping to define yourself
or find yourself or build yourself,

3147
03:23:03,600 --> 03:23:05,020
you all,

3148
03:23:05,090 --> 03:23:09,690
he very often succumb because how could
you not to pursuing shiny object after

3149
03:23:09,691 --> 03:23:12,540
shiny object?
And in the beginning I think that's fine.

3150
03:23:12,541 --> 03:23:13,980
And even for a very long period of time,

3151
03:23:13,981 --> 03:23:17,400
you throw a lot against the wall to see
what sticks and to discover what you're

3152
03:23:17,401 --> 03:23:19,290
good at, what you're terrible
at, where your weaknesses are,

3153
03:23:19,291 --> 03:23:21,750
what your strengths are.
But over time,

3154
03:23:21,900 --> 03:23:25,260
whether you're looking at some of the
most successful investors in the world,

3155
03:23:25,261 --> 03:23:29,940
like Ray Dalio of Bridgewater associates,
they manage $160 billion at last count.

3156
03:23:30,630 --> 03:23:32,190
And uh,

3157
03:23:32,340 --> 03:23:37,340
or athletes like Marcello Garcia who
will not train a technique that he cannot

3158
03:23:38,521 --> 03:23:43,500
use on a 300 pound muscular opponent.
He just will not train. The ITI did not.

3159
03:23:43,501 --> 03:23:46,470
He does not drill techniques that he
cannot apply to someone twice its size.

3160
03:23:48,150 --> 03:23:52,710
And these are principles,
right? Whether it's safe and it,

3161
03:23:52,740 --> 03:23:56,640
and you can take principles from
one domain and transplant them,

3162
03:23:56,641 --> 03:24:01,641
which is why I think this book is such
an excellent illustration of the value of

3163
03:24:01,681 --> 03:24:06,630
becoming exceptionally,
exceptionally good at something in a very,

3164
03:24:06,631 --> 03:24:09,960
very narrow band.
Because when you do that,

3165
03:24:10,890 --> 03:24:15,890
the constitution and the frameworks and
the principles that you developed for

3166
03:24:16,321 --> 03:24:20,190
yourself can then be applied everywhere.
So in Jujitsu, let's just say,

3167
03:24:20,191 --> 03:24:22,350
and I'm talking out my
ass a little bit since,

3168
03:24:22,410 --> 03:24:27,410
I certainly don't feel qualified to speak
to too much on Jujitsu at this table,

3169
03:24:27,811 --> 03:24:32,580
but if you take something like
position before submission,

3170
03:24:32,640 --> 03:24:34,140
right?
Let's just say for what,

3171
03:24:34,160 --> 03:24:36,630
for whatever reason you adopt that
and that's worked very well for you.

3172
03:24:36,840 --> 03:24:39,540
You can apply that to a lot,
right?

3173
03:24:40,170 --> 03:24:43,880
You can apply that to a lot of things.
And uh,

3174
03:24:43,980 --> 03:24:47,980
when you start to really think about
precepts and principles and the Docauto

3175
03:24:48,090 --> 03:24:53,090
that last a short book or
treatise of Musashi is,

3176
03:24:54,070 --> 03:24:58,590
is in a fact, uh, a
bulleted list of precepts

3177
03:25:00,090 --> 03:25:03,090
and pretty tough to follow all of them,
all of them at the same time.

3178
03:25:03,091 --> 03:25:05,040
By the way if you read them,

3179
03:25:06,960 --> 03:25:11,640
but if you just have a few, I
ended a, they can be very plain,

3180
03:25:12,570 --> 03:25:13,890
very much plain speech.

3181
03:25:13,891 --> 03:25:17,190
I mean let's just say it's say what
you mean mean mean what you say

3182
03:25:19,980 --> 03:25:23,640
do what you say you are going to do
on time. I mean very simple, right?

3183
03:25:23,910 --> 03:25:27,690
Then you have a recipe book, you have an
algorithm which is really just a step,

3184
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:32,610
a set of steps that produce a
given no and predetermined outcome.

3185
03:25:32,611 --> 03:25:36,960
Usually
if you follow those you,

3186
03:25:36,961 --> 03:25:40,560
you can start to mold
and define this path,

3187
03:25:40,590 --> 03:25:43,320
your way of moving through the world
and interacting with the world,

3188
03:25:43,800 --> 03:25:47,400
but if you're stuck in say

3189
03:25:49,710 --> 03:25:53,670
the weather patterns of the world instead
of looking at sort of the tectonic

3190
03:25:53,671 --> 03:25:57,030
plate level and you're focused
on these things, it change very,

3191
03:25:57,031 --> 03:25:58,770
very quickly like the news cycle,

3192
03:25:59,400 --> 03:26:01,740
like what your friends are saying
on social media at all times.

3193
03:26:02,130 --> 03:26:06,600
The fear of missing out in
social expectations that are set,

3194
03:26:06,660 --> 03:26:09,900
that make you want to posture because all
of your friends are putting highlights

3195
03:26:09,901 --> 03:26:11,400
of their lives on the Internet,

3196
03:26:11,401 --> 03:26:15,450
which makes you feel like a failure
because it's not all glamour shots.

3197
03:26:16,500 --> 03:26:21,390
Those are all just shifting weather
patterns. They mean nothing and you just,

3198
03:26:21,480 --> 03:26:25,920
you should let those pass
as they say in this book,

3199
03:26:26,430 --> 03:26:27,890
it comes up a lot.
Uh,

3200
03:26:28,170 --> 03:26:33,170
as much as froth froth that comes
up a lot in Musashi and flies,

3201
03:26:36,661 --> 03:26:39,900
right?
Froth and flies and insects.

3202
03:26:40,920 --> 03:26:44,880
He's passing phenomena
versus thinking about,

3203
03:26:44,881 --> 03:26:47,160
in his case he uses the
mountains and so on,

3204
03:26:47,850 --> 03:26:50,850
but the lower levels that tend to be less,

3205
03:26:52,080 --> 03:26:55,380
they're less sexy, they
don't move as quickly. Uh,

3206
03:26:55,530 --> 03:27:00,530
but if you understand those slower
moving and by extensions a timeless

3207
03:27:03,961 --> 03:27:07,650
principles and you can use those
to carve and form and find,

3208
03:27:07,651 --> 03:27:12,390
rediscovered your own path than I think
it just gives you a much greater level

3209
03:27:12,391 --> 03:27:16,170
of peace in part because it gives
you a much greater level of agency.

3210
03:27:16,200 --> 03:27:21,200
You feel like you can craft
your experience of life
as opposed to being tossed

3211
03:27:24,450 --> 03:27:29,450
back and forth by the vagaries of fast
changing factors you have no control over

3212
03:27:34,170 --> 03:27:38,360
man. Well I suppose we
could talk about this, um,

3213
03:27:38,630 --> 03:27:42,100
indefinitely,
but we're using up too

3214
03:27:42,100 --> 03:27:47,020
much bandwidth already. Um, Echo.

3215
03:27:47,170 --> 03:27:48,640
Speaking of the path,

3216
03:27:49,120 --> 03:27:53,470
do you have any recommendations of maybe
how people could stay on the path and,

3217
03:27:53,670 --> 03:27:58,570
and, and, you know, maybe even
support? Sure. Real quick though,

3218
03:27:59,630 --> 03:28:03,400
as far as pronunciation goes,
when there's like a double consonant,

3219
03:28:03,520 --> 03:28:08,170
you kind of say I'm both. Huh? Like,
like this Dakota, you say dope.

3220
03:28:08,171 --> 03:28:09,940
Cotto yeah,
there's a little stutter in it.

3221
03:28:10,650 --> 03:28:13,900
Cause it's almost like you got to finish
the first K and then start the second

3222
03:28:13,901 --> 03:28:17,300
kid. Yeah. It's, it's, it's,
it's, yeah, it's kind of a,

3223
03:28:17,440 --> 03:28:20,410
I think it would be considered
what they call it. Glottal stops.

3224
03:28:20,411 --> 03:28:23,770
So like Hokkaido in Japan is
actually Ho guy though. Right? Right.

3225
03:28:23,830 --> 03:28:28,160
But if there was only one kid be
Hokkaido. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. We're,

3226
03:28:28,240 --> 03:28:32,800
school took me a long time, which was
really embarrassing in the beginning,

3227
03:28:32,860 --> 03:28:35,150
working on my pronunciation.
Uh,

3228
03:28:36,520 --> 03:28:40,210
I had to say the word school a lot. I
was going to school, walking to school.

3229
03:28:40,211 --> 03:28:42,310
When are you going to school and its goal,

3230
03:28:43,150 --> 03:28:46,390
which has that little stutter and man,
did I mess that up?

3231
03:28:48,060 --> 03:28:49,440
Well,
I certainly uh,

3232
03:28:49,960 --> 03:28:54,540
cast a broad apology to all of
my Japanese friends especially,

3233
03:28:54,541 --> 03:28:56,590
they're going to be going crazy.
I'm sorry.

3234
03:28:57,070 --> 03:28:59,280
It's interesting that you care because in,
in,

3235
03:28:59,460 --> 03:29:00,960
in the Hawaiian language they put a,

3236
03:29:01,720 --> 03:29:05,850
it's actually considered another
letter. It's, it's called the Oak Kenai.

3237
03:29:05,851 --> 03:29:10,540
It's basically an apostrophe. In Hawaii
there's a lot of vowels go together,

3238
03:29:10,570 --> 03:29:11,770
right?
So when you want,

3239
03:29:11,830 --> 03:29:15,310
when you want to do that little function
to separate them, you put the Oak Ina,

3240
03:29:15,311 --> 03:29:19,200
they're like, like the word Hawaii,
Hawaii. There's two eyes at the end.

3241
03:29:19,210 --> 03:29:22,450
So you say Hawaii, you remember you
were asking me, Oh, I just say call.

3242
03:29:22,590 --> 03:29:25,650
How do you say quiets it quiet?
[inaudible] I think technically it's cool.

3243
03:29:25,750 --> 03:29:28,690
I typically don't say cola anymore.

3244
03:29:29,560 --> 03:29:33,310
That's a whole nother theory. Very similar
but similar deal, right? Similar deal.

3245
03:29:33,320 --> 03:29:35,070
Like, this is with consonant, straight A,

3246
03:29:35,071 --> 03:29:38,330
and I don't want to take
us too far afield, but you,

3247
03:29:38,590 --> 03:29:43,590
there are some really weird similarities
between Japanese and other languages

3248
03:29:44,471 --> 03:29:49,471
where there may have been trade roots
established before the dawn of man in

3249
03:29:49,481 --> 03:29:51,330
weird places.
Uh,

3250
03:29:51,530 --> 03:29:56,530
so there are some commonalities
in Polynesian languages
and then you also find

3251
03:29:58,330 --> 03:30:03,290
incredible commonalities with
Turkish of all languages. Yeah.

3252
03:30:03,460 --> 03:30:04,900
Nearly identical grammar.

3253
03:30:05,110 --> 03:30:09,340
I remember when I was taking
linguistic classes and their,

3254
03:30:09,341 --> 03:30:13,030
what they would point out these weird,
weird commonalities that you say, wow,

3255
03:30:13,031 --> 03:30:17,740
that's, you know, like things that like
the number one things like the sun,

3256
03:30:17,830 --> 03:30:18,820
things that it,
you know,

3257
03:30:18,850 --> 03:30:21,800
everyone kind of has to have
created a word for it some point.

3258
03:30:21,830 --> 03:30:24,250
The other is definitely some
strings and I forget what they are.

3259
03:30:24,790 --> 03:30:29,120
I didn't study hard enough. I wasn't
on the path fit and closely enough.

3260
03:30:30,580 --> 03:30:32,150
But a lot of these languages like that,
you know,

3261
03:30:32,200 --> 03:30:37,030
even the pronunciation of like a is
Ah, you know, Japanese Hawaiian, yeah.

3262
03:30:37,240 --> 03:30:39,920
You know, all these very
soft bowels. Typically.

3263
03:30:39,980 --> 03:30:42,400
Yeah. Uh, a e O Ooh. Yeah.

3264
03:30:42,890 --> 03:30:45,320
And then that I is like e yeah.

3265
03:30:45,950 --> 03:30:50,950
Japanese people can handle Spanish is
probably the closest that I've seen

3266
03:30:51,620 --> 03:30:54,500
language that they can handle.
Any language that ends on consonants,

3267
03:30:54,501 --> 03:30:58,400
a lot is going to be so right. I
remember. They've such tough time.

3268
03:30:58,790 --> 03:31:02,390
They add the you at the end. Yeah.
The teams and Tim, Tim or Jeff,

3269
03:31:02,391 --> 03:31:07,390
the same mcbeaty or yeah, be it
a nub. I beat her. Mcdonald's
is Monica Donato. Yay.

3270
03:31:07,790 --> 03:31:12,290
And then they have a tough
time. Uh, but the, and the,

3271
03:31:12,320 --> 03:31:13,580
for those people wondering,

3272
03:31:13,610 --> 03:31:17,240
the reason they can't or have
so much trouble distinguishing
between r's and L's,

3273
03:31:18,560 --> 03:31:20,630
which many other Asian people do not.

3274
03:31:20,870 --> 03:31:25,870
But in the case of Japanese is because
they have a blended phoneme of blended

3275
03:31:26,121 --> 03:31:30,950
sound. It's a, it's a combination
of our l and d. So naughty you dude.

3276
03:31:30,960 --> 03:31:32,750
It is how they say it.

3277
03:31:32,780 --> 03:31:37,780
So that do that like sound is not clearly
distinguished into multiple consonants

3278
03:31:39,771 --> 03:31:42,230
in Japanese, which is why they have
so much trouble with r's and L's.

3279
03:31:42,231 --> 03:31:44,780
But you can teach them to
fix that in a few minutes.

3280
03:31:44,810 --> 03:31:46,430
If you explain how the
tongue is positioned.

3281
03:31:47,300 --> 03:31:52,300
And I remember at one point I give
credit to my first Japanese teacher,

3282
03:31:53,510 --> 03:31:54,530
Mr Shimano,

3283
03:31:55,310 --> 03:31:59,780
who was fantastic because we would
hit a sticking point in class,

3284
03:31:59,781 --> 03:32:03,860
we'd be going over some concept that was
really difficult for a native English

3285
03:32:03,861 --> 03:32:06,290
speaker,
his brain to wrap itself around,

3286
03:32:06,770 --> 03:32:10,370
like they have subject markers and the
difference between why God and if it's

3287
03:32:10,371 --> 03:32:12,740
known to the speaker, it's
this, if they're not known
to the speaker, it's that.

3288
03:32:12,741 --> 03:32:17,030
And you're like, what's like,
what does that even mean?
And he could sense because,

3289
03:32:17,031 --> 03:32:21,100
uh, I, I transferred
from a very weak school,

3290
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:26,120
very bad school on long island to a
very highly competitive school in New

3291
03:32:27,410 --> 03:32:31,490
Hampshire that had classes six
days a week, mandatory seated meal,

3292
03:32:31,491 --> 03:32:32,660
like dead Poets Society,

3293
03:32:32,661 --> 03:32:37,661
Mandatory Sports classes from 8:00 AM
or so to about 6:00 PM and the Japanese

3294
03:32:37,881 --> 03:32:42,020
class was very often the class after
sports. So people were wiped out,

3295
03:32:42,650 --> 03:32:43,550
hadn't had dinner,

3296
03:32:44,300 --> 03:32:48,500
and we'd be struggling in getting agitated
with some aspect of Japanese and he

3297
03:32:48,501 --> 03:32:51,020
could tell that we were,
we were, we were losing it,

3298
03:32:52,540 --> 03:32:54,710
but we still had 45 minutes to go.
So it's all right.

3299
03:32:56,150 --> 03:32:58,070
Had a really strong Japanese
accent and he'd be like,

3300
03:32:59,030 --> 03:33:04,030
we're gonna stop for a minute and I'm
going to attempt to say this word for you.

3301
03:33:04,250 --> 03:33:09,250
And you would write squirrel
on the blackboard if you
want to talk about a word

3302
03:33:09,650 --> 03:33:13,520
that would be designed to be Kryptonite
for Japanese person. And so he would,

3303
03:33:13,521 --> 03:33:18,521
he would take like five minutes for just
comedic effect to just go scar scorer,

3304
03:33:20,070 --> 03:33:24,860
screw. I need to do that for like two
minutes and we crack up and loosen up and

3305
03:33:24,861 --> 03:33:27,470
realize, okay, everyone is
learning a new language,

3306
03:33:27,471 --> 03:33:30,410
has some type of sticking point like
this. And then he'd be like, okay,

3307
03:33:30,500 --> 03:33:34,040
enough fun and games. Now back to
the hard stuff. He's an excellent,

3308
03:33:34,041 --> 03:33:38,220
excellent teacher. Yeah,
it's legit. Speaking of hard

3309
03:33:38,220 --> 03:33:41,130
stuff,
speak quick,

3310
03:33:41,131 --> 03:33:44,010
my brother please for
the love of God all good.

3311
03:33:44,130 --> 03:33:46,930
I was going to talk more about your
retreat, but we can talk about that later.

3312
03:33:48,000 --> 03:33:51,390
In the meantime,
wouldn't take care of her joints or gin.

3313
03:33:51,391 --> 03:33:56,310
main.com is a good spot to
get these joint supplements.

3314
03:33:56,340 --> 03:34:00,210
Chaco supplements, Super Krill
Oil, not just regular Krill oil.

3315
03:34:00,250 --> 03:34:04,530
Supercar Krill oil. Yeah, clearly. All
upstairs actually. Boom. There you go.

3316
03:34:04,710 --> 03:34:07,590
Also another one called
Jocko joint warfare.

3317
03:34:07,620 --> 03:34:12,510
It's a blend of joint degeneration,

3318
03:34:12,570 --> 03:34:13,410
warfare,

3319
03:34:13,770 --> 03:34:18,770
weapons check technically also
for some legit fitness gear.

3320
03:34:19,021 --> 03:34:21,900
If you're in the kettle, you into
kettlebells. Yeah, I have some in my, uh,

3321
03:34:21,990 --> 03:34:23,250
my garage here.
It's the only,

3322
03:34:23,280 --> 03:34:26,670
the only fitness tools I have right now
are two kilovolts. Boom. There you go.

3323
03:34:26,671 --> 03:34:30,390
So boom, I got mine from
on it. Yeah. Squat rack.

3324
03:34:31,620 --> 03:34:34,210
I go to a gym for that right now,
but yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll get,

3325
03:34:34,250 --> 03:34:37,890
I'll get kettlebells are
dope. Yeah. Especially the
ones from audit, by the way.

3326
03:34:37,980 --> 03:34:42,030
Werewolf gorilla,
bigfoot chimp.

3327
03:34:42,090 --> 03:34:45,460
I'm just listing the ones. Oh, I
thought you were calling me names.

3328
03:34:45,510 --> 03:34:47,200
The thing you're trying
out new names for me.

3329
03:34:48,200 --> 03:34:50,310
Those are the kettle kettlebells I
have, you know, the autistic one,

3330
03:34:50,770 --> 03:34:54,770
the dope months. Did you say artistic
or autistic artists? I'm just curious.

3331
03:34:54,771 --> 03:34:58,350
Just messing with and I don't
think they're up to stick at all,

3332
03:34:59,250 --> 03:35:03,990
but they are dope though. My opinion,
you're the regular ones. I have the ISO.

3333
03:35:04,010 --> 03:35:05,760
We're, we're sitting
here in Austin, Texas.

3334
03:35:05,761 --> 03:35:10,110
Not too far from Vaughn at HQ and I
actually bought two of the standard issue.

3335
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:14,700
I know you're like me. Yeah. Just cut,

3336
03:35:14,710 --> 03:35:18,600
not cut the decorations and just go.

3337
03:35:18,690 --> 03:35:21,840
I click got training in star
wars ones though. They do. Yeah,

3338
03:35:21,841 --> 03:35:25,650
the Darth Vader one and storm trooper.
The Darth Vader once. Cool. Yeah,

3339
03:35:25,680 --> 03:35:28,500
I've seen it. You got to kind of admit
it after awhile. You're like, okay,

3340
03:35:28,501 --> 03:35:31,470
I mean me, I don't care. I'm
like, Hey, come to my house.
See my kettle bells. Yeah,

3341
03:35:31,471 --> 03:35:34,020
they're dope. But some people
Jocko, they're like, no, you know,

3342
03:35:34,440 --> 03:35:36,240
wants to say hardcore,
but you got to admit it.

3343
03:35:36,270 --> 03:35:40,000
I'm more of a Boba Fett guy myself.
But yeah, I do like Darth Vader. Yeah,

3344
03:35:40,470 --> 03:35:44,730
check those out anyway on it.com Mecca.
And they got other stuff on there too. Um,

3345
03:35:46,350 --> 03:35:49,680
pretty much for any kind
of workout other than what,

3346
03:35:49,710 --> 03:35:54,150
like your typical gym workout,
like they have maces and whatnot.

3347
03:35:55,020 --> 03:35:59,310
So anyway, go down on it. Yeah. And just
as a side note for people listening,

3348
03:36:01,980 --> 03:36:05,700
don't, alright. I've had enough caffeine.
I've been off of caffeine for 10 days.

3349
03:36:05,701 --> 03:36:08,490
So we do a lot of personality
right now. Uh, all good.

3350
03:36:08,550 --> 03:36:13,320
Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
when it comes to working out or home gyms

3351
03:36:13,350 --> 03:36:14,183
or anything like that.

3352
03:36:14,220 --> 03:36:18,660
Don't say I can't start because I don't
have these seven pieces of equipment for

3353
03:36:18,840 --> 03:36:23,840
two years when I had very little money
and was training in Jujitsu when I just

3354
03:36:25,111 --> 03:36:27,540
moved to the bay area,
which is stupidly expensive.

3355
03:36:28,290 --> 03:36:30,660
I had roommates and no space whatsoever.

3356
03:36:30,690 --> 03:36:35,690
I had one 53 pound kettle bell and I did
everything with that kettle I did and I

3357
03:36:36,941 --> 03:36:40,180
got into that combined with Jujitsu,
that's all I had space for.

3358
03:36:40,181 --> 03:36:44,440
It was one kettle bell. I got into some
of the best shape of my entire life. Yeah.

3359
03:36:44,520 --> 03:36:46,750
You're like kettled off 53 pounds.
That's nothing. It's like, okay,

3360
03:36:47,320 --> 03:36:50,880
do 20 pistols with 50 pounder. Yeah. Yeah.

3361
03:36:50,970 --> 03:36:53,730
Let's see if you can do one
review the three pounds.

3362
03:36:54,420 --> 03:36:57,690
Cause a lot of people couldn't even do
one pistol with a 53 pound kettlebell.

3363
03:36:57,760 --> 03:37:01,190
Yeah. That's like the goal.
Yeah. Yeah. And I'll say,

3364
03:37:01,510 --> 03:37:03,610
I don't want to say I was
against kettlebells before,

3365
03:37:03,611 --> 03:37:06,650
but you know when they first kind
of came on the scene here. Yeah.

3366
03:37:06,910 --> 03:37:09,910
And then people were like, yeah,
kettlebells and look how cool we are.

3367
03:37:09,911 --> 03:37:12,910
You know how like when people do that,
you kind of build this kind of natural,

3368
03:37:13,060 --> 03:37:15,710
not resentment, but just
some resistance. Like,

3369
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:19,000
I'm not going to jump on your little band.
Like I see what you're doing, you know,

3370
03:37:19,060 --> 03:37:20,360
I'm a stick to this.
Or,

3371
03:37:21,010 --> 03:37:24,910
and then finally I got on the boat and
kind of shit it got on that earlier man.

3372
03:37:25,360 --> 03:37:29,740
Kettlebells and you don't need to be,
I will say not a doctor,

3373
03:37:29,741 --> 03:37:32,440
don't play one on the Internet,
but just to uh,

3374
03:37:32,590 --> 03:37:35,410
to keep Jockos liability
insurance premiums,

3375
03:37:35,411 --> 03:37:39,340
low kettlebells.
Don't get too fancy.

3376
03:37:39,341 --> 03:37:40,690
Kids with the kettle bells.

3377
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:44,890
Don't pick up a kettle ball for the first
time and tried to do snatches. Yeah,

3378
03:37:45,100 --> 03:37:47,920
it's a good way to, uh, get
reconstructive shoulder surgery.

3379
03:37:48,370 --> 03:37:52,510
You don't need to do a whole lot if you
just do two handed Kettlebell swings

3380
03:37:52,540 --> 03:37:56,590
properly, which I would not in my
book would not be above the shoulder.

3381
03:37:57,310 --> 03:38:01,290
And you do,
let's just say some Turkish getups,

3382
03:38:01,300 --> 03:38:05,620
even partial Turkish getups and
a handful of other exercises.

3383
03:38:05,621 --> 03:38:08,200
I'm particular wind mills
in caustic squads and so on.

3384
03:38:09,250 --> 03:38:10,740
You really don't need much and you,

3385
03:38:10,780 --> 03:38:14,950
you don't have to do potentially dangerous
ballistic movements to get a lot out

3386
03:38:14,951 --> 03:38:16,090
of kettlebells.
Yeah.

3387
03:38:16,120 --> 03:38:20,890
And I personally would even go further
and say don't do much like especially

3388
03:38:20,891 --> 03:38:23,550
like the like Turkish get the snatch too.

3389
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:27,370
Like these ones where snatch beautiful
color. Yeah. If you're trying to like,

3390
03:38:28,810 --> 03:38:30,340
let me get that big one.
Cause it's cool.

3391
03:38:30,341 --> 03:38:33,280
You look at them and this one's like
obviously bigger than the other.

3392
03:38:33,290 --> 03:38:35,920
I'm going to get down mean the
last time you were at my house,

3393
03:38:35,921 --> 03:38:39,620
I was over there dude. Every exercise
with the biggest kettlebells I asked me.

3394
03:38:39,621 --> 03:38:44,440
Yeah. So I dig it man. But man, if you
start doing these snatches or the man,

3395
03:38:44,441 --> 03:38:48,130
I had to have this big foot one,
it's 90 pounds and me.

3396
03:38:49,000 --> 03:38:52,280
So I can, I mean now I can boom, clean,

3397
03:38:52,281 --> 03:38:56,110
impressed one hand I'll go like, oh, go
to this side to this, that in to this,

3398
03:38:56,160 --> 03:38:58,930
you know, I'll do that.
And it wasn't like,

3399
03:38:58,931 --> 03:39:01,780
I don't know if I wasn't warm or
I just hit it at the wrong angle.

3400
03:39:01,781 --> 03:39:05,560
I got it up to here and
then when I pressed it up,

3401
03:39:05,561 --> 03:39:09,070
I think he was too far back. So it went
like when I press it was weird. You know,

3402
03:39:09,080 --> 03:39:11,320
kettle bells are they big tank back there.

3403
03:39:11,860 --> 03:39:14,320
So when I pressed it up it's
almost like it went backwards.

3404
03:39:14,410 --> 03:39:17,740
Messed up my shoulder a
little bit. Yeah. Yeah.

3405
03:39:17,741 --> 03:39:20,350
You will be able to press
as well as you can clean.

3406
03:39:20,440 --> 03:39:25,440
So if you cannot clean a weight
extremely smoothly to your side,

3407
03:39:28,780 --> 03:39:33,100
do not try to press it. Yeah. It had
been, just be careful. Start Light.

3408
03:39:33,140 --> 03:39:34,250
That's the point,
right?

3409
03:39:34,330 --> 03:39:35,510
Yeah.
Unless you're Jocko,

3410
03:39:37,100 --> 03:39:40,460
I'm not saying anything over
here because of liability.

3411
03:39:40,930 --> 03:39:45,710
I know I give the worst advice on this
kind of stuff, so sometimes yes, for sure.

3412
03:39:46,220 --> 03:39:50,900
Also if you don't have a copy of Musashi,

3413
03:39:51,170 --> 03:39:54,440
yeah,
I'm going to list it on the website,

3414
03:39:55,170 --> 03:39:57,440
a Goto Jocko podcast.com.

3415
03:39:57,441 --> 03:40:01,520
Go to the books section right there
on the top menu. Boom. Click on there.

3416
03:40:01,550 --> 03:40:03,230
It will be actually,
it's been on there.

3417
03:40:03,500 --> 03:40:08,060
It's been on there since you mentioned
it. It's been on there for a year. Yeah,

3418
03:40:08,750 --> 03:40:12,210
I'll put it right at the top. Don't even
have to scroll down. Boom. Click on it.

3419
03:40:12,880 --> 03:40:13,480
It is good.

3420
03:40:13,480 --> 03:40:17,960
I had another book to the page
or Cortland thousand percent.

3421
03:40:18,800 --> 03:40:21,900
That's a lot of percent. I'm on it. Uh,

3422
03:40:22,490 --> 03:40:26,750
so I have a brand new book that is out,

3423
03:40:26,751 --> 03:40:29,890
which Jocko is a part of as a,

3424
03:40:30,230 --> 03:40:32,960
as a continuation of our
lifelong partnership.

3425
03:40:33,820 --> 03:40:36,740
Jocko has a reappearance
in tribe of mentors,

3426
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:41,180
which is I think the easiest to read
book that I have yet put together.

3427
03:40:41,181 --> 03:40:46,181
It is a brand spanking new who has 130
people all asked the same 11 questions

3428
03:40:47,570 --> 03:40:51,430
that were most burning for me.
And uh,

3429
03:40:51,590 --> 03:40:55,880
is that a thousand page book because it's
this thick. It's shorter than Musashi,

3430
03:40:55,881 --> 03:41:00,080
which isn't saying much.
It is a about 650 pages.

3431
03:41:00,110 --> 03:41:05,110
Each profile is ranges between two in
10 pages and a number of the people who

3432
03:41:08,331 --> 03:41:10,010
came up in our conversation,

3433
03:41:10,040 --> 03:41:14,090
like Dan Gable who won a gold medal in
the Olympics for wrestling without having

3434
03:41:14,091 --> 03:41:17,690
a single point scored on him.
Ridiculous.

3435
03:41:17,691 --> 03:41:19,740
It's like winning Wimbledon and
that having a point scored on. Yeah,

3436
03:41:19,820 --> 03:41:24,800
it doesn't happen. People, uh,
and many, many, many others.

3437
03:41:25,040 --> 03:41:28,850
So it covers every possible
facet of human performance,

3438
03:41:28,880 --> 03:41:33,650
whether it's a physical
training, uh, expert meditators,

3439
03:41:33,680 --> 03:41:38,630
worldclass investors, the founders of
Facebook, Twitter, salesforce, linkedin,

3440
03:41:38,631 --> 03:41:41,630
you name it. If you want super,
super tactical and nuggets of advice,

3441
03:41:41,631 --> 03:41:44,900
including some from our
good friend Jocko Willink,

3442
03:41:45,870 --> 03:41:49,430
then Sharben mentors is a easy to digest.

3443
03:41:49,460 --> 03:41:51,860
Choose your own adventure book.

3444
03:41:52,160 --> 03:41:56,780
That would be a nice nonfiction
compliment to our friend Musashi. Yeah,

3445
03:41:56,920 --> 03:42:00,860
I'm put it up there right
next to it. Boom. And so what
that does is you click on,

3446
03:42:00,861 --> 03:42:03,920
it takes you through to
Amazon. Boom. What was the,

3447
03:42:03,921 --> 03:42:07,370
what was the website again for
your book page? Jocko, podcast.com.

3448
03:42:07,700 --> 03:42:11,020
I think it might be slash books maybe,
but easiest way,

3449
03:42:11,030 --> 03:42:14,600
you know the top menu on the website,
but it just, it looks from the pot,

3450
03:42:14,660 --> 03:42:18,710
from episodes, whatever I am. Yeah. Click
on there, boom. Click through there.

3451
03:42:18,770 --> 03:42:22,550
And if you're doing any other Amazon
shopping, you know, hey, carry on.

3452
03:42:23,110 --> 03:42:25,950
No one's going to stop you there.
Also subscribe to the podcast.

3453
03:42:26,840 --> 03:42:30,410
I was just going to say,
they may have already removed this,

3454
03:42:30,480 --> 03:42:32,160
a little glitch in

3455
03:42:32,190 --> 03:42:36,660
the system, but I used to be
able to buy trap bars and so on,

3456
03:42:36,661 --> 03:42:40,110
on Amazon prime with
no shipping trap bars.

3457
03:42:40,730 --> 03:42:43,480
So hex bar. Oh right,
right. It's like a hug,

3458
03:42:43,800 --> 03:42:46,910
like 60 pounds to a hundred
pounds of metal. Uh,

3459
03:42:47,040 --> 03:42:50,670
so while you're picking
up your brain food,

3460
03:42:50,750 --> 03:42:54,510
you can pick up your body
tools. Boom. Eventually dig it.

3461
03:42:55,590 --> 03:42:58,930
Amazon. Yeah, Amazon is pretty
good with their shipping situation.

3462
03:42:58,990 --> 03:43:03,500
I gotta tell you, even if the, you want
it, like whatever the next day, you know,

3463
03:43:03,600 --> 03:43:06,540
we were like good additional shipping.
It's like four bucks or something. Oh,

3464
03:43:06,541 --> 03:43:10,750
it's amazing. Yeah. He got something
right on that one. You know,

3465
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:14,580
I also subscribe to the podcast if you
haven't already on iTunes and stitcher

3466
03:43:14,820 --> 03:43:17,790
and Google play and Spotify.
I think,

3467
03:43:18,500 --> 03:43:23,070
I think real confident that
whatever you're listening to,

3468
03:43:23,071 --> 03:43:27,570
the podcast on, boom, subscribe. Also
on Youtube. If you haven't already,

3469
03:43:28,020 --> 03:43:31,890
there's more than just the podcast I
needed to. It's excerpts on Youtube.

3470
03:43:32,780 --> 03:43:36,780
What are you going to put some,
some takeaways or what did they call it?

3471
03:43:36,810 --> 03:43:39,250
Outtakes from this because there
were some pretty funny ones.

3472
03:43:41,930 --> 03:43:46,500
They were, but we were all
laughing. I think so. In fact, yes,

3473
03:43:46,530 --> 03:43:47,880
that's exactly what I'm going to do,

3474
03:43:48,090 --> 03:43:51,150
which is one of the many reasons to
subscribe to the Youtube Channel,

3475
03:43:51,330 --> 03:43:53,610
in my opinion.
What is the Youtube Channel?

3476
03:43:54,600 --> 03:43:58,380
Jocko podcasts do your big role,
the ubiquitous,

3477
03:43:58,620 --> 03:44:01,380
so make sure we spell it out.
I'm so bad at this.

3478
03:44:03,150 --> 03:44:07,260
I'm just the hand wavy PT Barnum
guy gets technically were true.

3479
03:44:07,290 --> 03:44:08,870
When we say subscribe to the podcast,

3480
03:44:08,880 --> 03:44:12,630
technically we are asking them to go
on Youtube, search for Jocko podcast.

3481
03:44:12,631 --> 03:44:16,240
Make sure it's the correct one. You
know, sometimes there'll be like jock, go

3482
03:44:18,630 --> 03:44:23,580
see Tim adding tons of, yeah, you
could just get, you could get,

3483
03:44:23,581 --> 03:44:26,610
and, uh, since this will not be
published for probably a few hours,

3484
03:44:26,611 --> 03:44:31,611
at least you guys could get a URL like
Jocko subscribed.com and then have it

3485
03:44:32,281 --> 03:44:36,360
point to a page on your website where you
have all of the links where people can

3486
03:44:36,361 --> 03:44:38,400
click for different services to subscribe.
Man,

3487
03:44:38,401 --> 03:44:42,960
I wish I had somebody that worked with
me that like did computer type stuff and

3488
03:44:43,020 --> 03:44:48,020
stuff like that because maybe they would
have done that at the beginning when we

3489
03:44:48,181 --> 03:44:51,870
first started this stuff like that.
I was thinking of all of these things.

3490
03:44:51,871 --> 03:44:54,510
This is what I'm going to buy
Jocko, podcasts, this and all this.

3491
03:44:54,511 --> 03:44:57,220
Then we can have them all and we'll,
I'll do this stuff. And then, um,

3492
03:44:57,270 --> 03:44:59,640
like your whole attitude.
You didn't tell me not to do it.

3493
03:45:00,210 --> 03:45:01,440
I'm not blaming this on you.

3494
03:45:01,441 --> 03:45:06,310
I'm just saying that that's
what I was real fired up to
do. But he's like, no man,

3495
03:45:06,340 --> 03:45:10,020
that's it. Jocko store. That's
it. You know, like super
simple. So I'm like, Oh yeah,

3496
03:45:10,021 --> 03:45:14,150
that's, that's cool right there. So like
all the cool little thing. I will, I'll,

3497
03:45:14,240 --> 03:45:19,180
I'll, I will jockos defense, you know, say

3498
03:45:21,060 --> 03:45:24,450
I see tears welling up in the
eyes. Uh, in Giagos defense,

3499
03:45:24,451 --> 03:45:29,451
I will say that a lot of people who try
to start podcasts or do x get caught

3500
03:45:32,890 --> 03:45:37,890
with the obsession on new tactics.

3501
03:45:39,520 --> 03:45:42,190
And then above tactics you would have
strategy and the most strategy would have

3502
03:45:42,191 --> 03:45:43,930
principles.
And so if,

3503
03:45:43,990 --> 03:45:48,490
if you're constantly focused on
optimizing for an additional 1% with these

3504
03:45:48,491 --> 03:45:52,960
tools, you get nowhere. On the
other hand, if I would say,

3505
03:45:53,080 --> 03:45:55,540
like you guys have done with
this podcast to focus on

3506
03:45:57,210 --> 03:46:01,620
exceptionally high quality,
that fixes a lot of problems.

3507
03:46:02,010 --> 03:46:06,780
And then other people use tactics on
your behalf and you don't have to be as

3508
03:46:06,781 --> 03:46:11,781
concerned with the ebb and flow
and expiration dates of said tools.

3509
03:46:12,600 --> 03:46:16,240
So there's always a good time.
Always a market

3510
03:46:18,730 --> 03:46:22,200
uncrowded market is great.
That's the only uncredited market.

3511
03:46:23,100 --> 03:46:27,510
Dang. See. And just to be
clear, when you were like that,

3512
03:46:28,050 --> 03:46:31,230
it wasn't that you were like
influencing me not to do it.

3513
03:46:31,231 --> 03:46:34,740
You just like the way you were was cool
to me. I was like, Dang, that's cool.

3514
03:46:34,741 --> 03:46:38,070
So I'm going to just keep
it super simple to me.

3515
03:46:38,071 --> 03:46:41,010
Just kind of trying to be like you.
But yeah, I thought of that same thing.

3516
03:46:41,011 --> 03:46:43,500
I'm going to have the thing and
it'll have all the links. Aw Man.

3517
03:46:43,501 --> 03:46:46,800
That'll be great. Then meanwhile he's
like, let's record a podcast, so, okay,

3518
03:46:46,801 --> 03:46:51,630
let's do that. You know, so we
let that other stuff go. Anyway,

3519
03:46:52,650 --> 03:46:57,360
Youtube, back to youtube,
Jocko podcast, regular logo,

3520
03:46:57,361 --> 03:47:00,420
black white letters. Boom. That's it.

3521
03:47:00,421 --> 03:47:04,440
That's the one that you want to
subscribe to. Also, Jack was the store.

3522
03:47:04,470 --> 03:47:09,450
It's called chocolate store and I see
that. No bells, no whistles. Jocko,

3523
03:47:09,810 --> 03:47:14,490
store.com t shirts, travel mugs,
bumper stickers, all that stuff.

3524
03:47:14,491 --> 03:47:17,430
Some rash guards,
new rash guards,

3525
03:47:19,450 --> 03:47:23,530
hoodies, picker, hoodies. I got
people sending Marines, thermometers,

3526
03:47:24,070 --> 03:47:28,910
Nebraska actually. Yeah,

3527
03:47:28,911 --> 03:47:31,110
someone did that to me
too. What about your, uh,

3528
03:47:31,120 --> 03:47:35,990
your crop tops with the discipline equals
love on them for those out of stock

3529
03:47:35,991 --> 03:47:38,440
still.
Those are out of stock broker

3530
03:47:43,540 --> 03:47:47,420
actually, but the women's stuff is back
in stock as well. That was out for awhile.

3531
03:47:47,630 --> 03:47:52,570
Luke girls, you know for the
girls, for the ladies, boom,
back in the game, big time.

3532
03:47:53,380 --> 03:47:58,330
Some patches in there. And again,
the rash guards where your kid,

3533
03:47:59,440 --> 03:48:02,590
I think that's the one. Yeah,
actually there's another one. Yeah,

3534
03:48:02,780 --> 03:48:06,880
you or got them around.
Any question about rash guards?

3535
03:48:07,420 --> 03:48:12,400
I always assumed because I had never seen
rash guards until a few years into the

3536
03:48:12,401 --> 03:48:14,140
Jujitsu game,

3537
03:48:14,141 --> 03:48:18,730
I guess or observing that I assumed
that rash guards became part of Jujitsu

3538
03:48:18,731 --> 03:48:23,680
because Brazilians also surf a lot and
would then just use them in the gym.

3539
03:48:24,100 --> 03:48:28,280
What is the function of the rash guard?
I've never understood that.

3540
03:48:28,281 --> 03:48:32,960
I knew that because let's say versus
wearing a tight fitting like sweat wicking

3541
03:48:32,961 --> 03:48:36,890
shirt. Well, I mean it's not going to
be as tight fitting as a rash guard is,

3542
03:48:36,891 --> 03:48:39,940
right? A rash guard is
as tight Vinnie's, uh,

3543
03:48:40,130 --> 03:48:43,880
piece of garment can be and therefore
your fingers won't get caught in it.

3544
03:48:43,881 --> 03:48:46,640
Your toes won't get caught in it,
it won't get in the way. And that's,

3545
03:48:46,820 --> 03:48:50,540
that's why now you can also just go
shirtless, but when you go shirtless,

3546
03:48:50,541 --> 03:48:55,490
now you've got ringworm and,
and all whatever other heinous forms,

3547
03:48:56,030 --> 03:48:59,420
diseases that live on the mat. And so
that's, and it's just Kinda, you know,

3548
03:48:59,820 --> 03:49:00,770
it just takes it one,

3549
03:49:00,830 --> 03:49:04,700
one separation away from pure nastiness
when you're rolling with everyone.

3550
03:49:05,140 --> 03:49:07,640
But you guys should make,
maybe I'm the only one with this issue,

3551
03:49:07,641 --> 03:49:08,840
but I always find,

3552
03:49:08,841 --> 03:49:13,490
I feel constricted at the neck and the
hot in certain rash guards so that all

3553
03:49:13,491 --> 03:49:16,610
rash guards, but if there were one
that gave some space to the neck,

3554
03:49:17,480 --> 03:49:18,510
that would be,
yeah,

3555
03:49:19,610 --> 03:49:22,910
I think some brands
will have a wider neck,

3556
03:49:23,020 --> 03:49:27,500
wider know some brands will actually on
purpose have like a higher neck. Right.

3557
03:49:27,501 --> 03:49:30,920
Some people want full coverage in the gym.
They want,

3558
03:49:30,950 --> 03:49:32,860
they don't want to make
human contact with anyone.

3559
03:49:32,940 --> 03:49:36,180
It's just the Spiderman outfit while
they're trying to throw it out.

3560
03:49:37,310 --> 03:49:41,220
There's people that were in a little
hoods, I'm not kidding. So yeah,

3561
03:49:41,360 --> 03:49:44,950
it's getting crazy. People with
like hair or something like that,

3562
03:49:46,160 --> 03:49:49,640
they'll do that hood thing.
That's cool. But I can get you,

3563
03:49:49,641 --> 03:49:51,800
I can give you whatever kind of Roger
you want to loose neck, rash, guard.

3564
03:49:51,801 --> 03:49:54,740
I'll get your loose. Recommend
that rash guard. No one piece.

3565
03:49:54,860 --> 03:49:58,580
Say Discipline Equals love. If you
could get me a discipline equals love.

3566
03:49:58,590 --> 03:50:02,630
UNITARDS for my reentry
to the Jujitsu world,

3567
03:50:03,660 --> 03:50:07,550
that'll go over good.
Just before I tapped at t Ferris out,

3568
03:50:08,530 --> 03:50:11,060
I commented on his garment,

3569
03:50:13,250 --> 03:50:16,370
but yeah. Hey Jocko, store.com that's
where you get them. They're cool.

3570
03:50:17,060 --> 03:50:20,120
Also psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

3571
03:50:20,121 --> 03:50:21,950
it's an album with tracks.

3572
03:50:22,070 --> 03:50:27,070
Tim Ferris that if
you're on the path Foley,

3573
03:50:28,850 --> 03:50:31,880
but you find those days or those moments,
whatever,

3574
03:50:31,940 --> 03:50:34,130
that maybe you might
want to get this store.

3575
03:50:34,131 --> 03:50:37,010
You feel like you're going to
choose to step off the path.

3576
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:40,730
That's what it's for really. It's not
like when you suddenly get distracted,

3577
03:50:40,731 --> 03:50:45,630
it's like I'm going to wake up at
what? Five and um, just to, to,

3578
03:50:45,631 --> 03:50:48,200
I'm not going to wake up at five.
I'm gonna Sleep in.

3579
03:50:48,440 --> 03:50:51,170
He listened to one of these tracks.
This specified tracked though.

3580
03:50:51,230 --> 03:50:55,040
Wake up and get a, what's it called?
Wake up and get her fruit wake up.

3581
03:50:55,041 --> 03:50:55,874
You can get after it.

3582
03:50:55,940 --> 03:51:00,620
What it is is you play it and it's Jocko
telling you why you should wake up and

3583
03:51:00,621 --> 03:51:05,120
get after it pragmatically in
his own Jocko away. But there's,

3584
03:51:05,210 --> 03:51:08,690
there's tracks for everything. No
waking up, slipping on the diets,

3585
03:51:08,691 --> 03:51:10,970
skipping the workout, blah,
blah, blah. All that stuff. No,

3586
03:51:11,030 --> 03:51:15,020
let me interject here or actually
take over if you don't mind please.

3587
03:51:15,140 --> 03:51:17,660
Because the psychological
warfare, tra, uh,

3588
03:51:17,810 --> 03:51:22,430
album on iTunes was a number
one spoken word album for about,

3589
03:51:22,431 --> 03:51:26,190
I think nine months straight.
And unfortunately, good

3590
03:51:26,190 --> 03:51:28,370
news and bad news,
it was just taken down for I,

3591
03:51:28,380 --> 03:51:33,000
we just got beat out as the number one
album. There's now a new number one album.

3592
03:51:33,420 --> 03:51:35,030
Giraffes can't dance is not,

3593
03:51:35,040 --> 03:51:39,690
you're asking the new number one album
on iTunes spoken word is discipline

3594
03:51:39,691 --> 03:51:44,070
equals freedom field manual. Now it
was number one. Did you share that?

3595
03:51:44,760 --> 03:51:46,140
I get the report every day.

3596
03:51:46,260 --> 03:51:50,040
So if you've been looking for discipline
equals freedom field manual in audio

3597
03:51:50,041 --> 03:51:51,120
form yet formula,

3598
03:51:51,121 --> 03:51:54,270
it's not on audible because then
you couldn't put it in your alarm.

3599
03:51:54,300 --> 03:51:56,400
You couldn't listen to tracks
whenever you want it to.

3600
03:51:56,401 --> 03:51:58,020
That's why we didn't do it that way.

3601
03:51:58,170 --> 03:52:02,670
We put it is an as an album
with tracks on Amazon music,

3602
03:52:02,671 --> 03:52:05,790
Google play,
Spotify apart everywhere.

3603
03:52:06,480 --> 03:52:10,830
I think you can ask Alexa, she'll deliver
it. Alexa, like boom, you're there.

3604
03:52:11,540 --> 03:52:14,940
Uh, so that's out. Also
on Amazon Jocko white tea.

3605
03:52:15,420 --> 03:52:19,050
Most people think it's the best tea that
they've ever had and it's guaranteed,

3606
03:52:19,160 --> 03:52:19,800
um,

3607
03:52:19,800 --> 03:52:24,660
and scientifically proven to increase your
deadlift to a minimum of 8,000 pounds.

3608
03:52:24,960 --> 03:52:29,460
We have all backed up data on that. A
little blind, double blind, Quik trip,

3609
03:52:29,461 --> 03:52:34,260
quadruple blind other books to get on
Amazon and we might as well just put all

3610
03:52:34,261 --> 03:52:38,580
these books on our website.
Uh, so first Tim, Tim,

3611
03:52:38,730 --> 03:52:42,780
obviously four hour workweek,
four hour chef,

3612
03:52:43,080 --> 03:52:46,740
four hour body tools of titans.

3613
03:52:47,160 --> 03:52:49,590
Those are all books,
awesome books.

3614
03:52:50,250 --> 03:52:54,060
And I was thinking about four hour work
week and what I was thinking about for

3615
03:52:54,061 --> 03:52:57,030
our work week that I think when
I read it for the first time,

3616
03:52:57,031 --> 03:52:59,850
which was before I knew you what it did,

3617
03:52:59,880 --> 03:53:04,030
I didn't follow anything in your
book for our work week. I didn't,

3618
03:53:04,110 --> 03:53:05,920
I don't even follow one
thing. Maybe May, I dunno,

3619
03:53:05,940 --> 03:53:07,200
maybe there's two or
three things in there.

3620
03:53:07,420 --> 03:53:12,420
What it did though is it made me look
at things in a different way cause you

3621
03:53:13,081 --> 03:53:16,320
were saying, look, here's this and
you looked at it from over here.

3622
03:53:16,440 --> 03:53:20,520
And what it showed me was like I can
look at things differently and you know,

3623
03:53:20,730 --> 03:53:22,680
like I said, I probably grabbed
a couple things from there.

3624
03:53:22,860 --> 03:53:25,470
But the most important thing
that it gave me was like, okay,

3625
03:53:25,710 --> 03:53:29,160
you don't have to look at this the way
everyone else is looking at it and that's

3626
03:53:29,161 --> 03:53:29,550
the,

3627
03:53:29,550 --> 03:53:34,550
that's the best damn drill you can get
from somebody or the best advice you can

3628
03:53:35,101 --> 03:53:38,060
get somebody who's like don't look at
things the same way. Everyone else.

3629
03:53:38,130 --> 03:53:39,390
There's a whole nother angle.

3630
03:53:39,630 --> 03:53:42,690
And once I saw what angle you were
looking at it from, I looked at,

3631
03:53:42,691 --> 03:53:44,550
I started saying,
well let's look at it from my ankle.

3632
03:53:44,551 --> 03:53:48,870
What does this going to look like from
over here? So that's a great book.

3633
03:53:48,871 --> 03:53:52,170
And again, the four hour chef,
which is, it's about cooking,

3634
03:53:52,171 --> 03:53:55,350
but it's really about learning.
It's really about learning for our body.

3635
03:53:55,351 --> 03:53:59,820
All kinds of good experiments
that you did on yourself.

3636
03:53:59,970 --> 03:54:03,390
You're similar to me in the fact that
I'm always chasing some different goal.

3637
03:54:03,391 --> 03:54:06,210
I'm either trying to do Max pull ups
or I'm trying to do a Max deadlift for,

3638
03:54:06,211 --> 03:54:07,950
I'm trying to cut down
my one mile run time.

3639
03:54:07,951 --> 03:54:10,650
I'm always got some random thing
that I'm trying to do. And I, and,

3640
03:54:10,950 --> 03:54:13,240
and I explained this,
I'm actually,

3641
03:54:13,241 --> 03:54:15,090
I actually explained it when
I was just on your podcast. I,

3642
03:54:15,510 --> 03:54:20,100
if I'm not going to get to a 600 pound
dead lift because my whole life would

3643
03:54:20,101 --> 03:54:23,500
have to be different and I wouldn't be
able to do other things that I to do.

3644
03:54:23,740 --> 03:54:28,740
So I get to an 80% or an 85% of what
I'm actually humanly capable of.

3645
03:54:28,840 --> 03:54:31,120
And then I'm looking for that next
goal because I'm not going to change my

3646
03:54:31,121 --> 03:54:32,960
entire life. Uh, but what, what the,

3647
03:54:33,040 --> 03:54:36,100
what the four hour body is good for is
you've got a lot of different things that

3648
03:54:36,101 --> 03:54:39,940
you can bounce from thing to thing and
they're all going to improve some aspect.

3649
03:54:39,941 --> 03:54:41,860
So I thought that was awesome.
Tools of titans,

3650
03:54:41,861 --> 03:54:46,861
obviously tons of of good information
from all a lot of different people and,

3651
03:54:48,390 --> 03:54:51,490
and now you've got tribal mentors
and it's interesting because

3652
03:54:53,080 --> 03:54:57,070
you know when we talk about for 20 minutes
or however long we were talking about

3653
03:54:57,071 --> 03:55:01,510
the path for, well for people
out there that are saying
like, well what, what path?

3654
03:55:01,780 --> 03:55:03,610
And I'm sitting here trying to explain it,
it's hard.

3655
03:55:03,611 --> 03:55:05,950
I don't think I did a good job.
I took a swing at it.

3656
03:55:06,220 --> 03:55:09,460
But what's cool is you get a book like
tribe of mentors and you can kind of get

3657
03:55:09,461 --> 03:55:13,180
a feel for what other people's paths are
and how they stay on them and way they

3658
03:55:13,181 --> 03:55:14,014
live their lives.

3659
03:55:14,140 --> 03:55:18,400
And then you can at least at a minimum
get a different perspective from

3660
03:55:18,401 --> 03:55:19,210
different people,

3661
03:55:19,210 --> 03:55:24,210
which just like four hour work week for
me is very important to see different

3662
03:55:24,491 --> 03:55:28,580
people's angles on the way
they look at things. It's,

3663
03:55:28,581 --> 03:55:31,950
it's like it's an eye opener at a minimum.
Yeah,

3664
03:55:31,950 --> 03:55:33,000
the Lens. I mean, if you,

3665
03:55:33,001 --> 03:55:38,001
if you have a set of different lenses
that you can look through to evaluate the

3666
03:55:38,431 --> 03:55:43,070
world and make decisions,
evaluate yourself and make
different decisions, it's,

3667
03:55:43,130 --> 03:55:47,430
it can really change your life and
the lives of those around you very,

3668
03:55:47,431 --> 03:55:49,110
very quickly. Uh, what's,

3669
03:55:49,170 --> 03:55:52,440
what's been fun about putting
together in this case,

3670
03:55:52,441 --> 03:55:55,560
tribe of mentors is that I'm asking
people the same 11 questions.

3671
03:55:55,561 --> 03:55:57,150
So for instance,
I might ask,

3672
03:55:57,600 --> 03:56:02,600
what do you do or what do you tell
yourself when you feel overwhelmed or get

3673
03:56:02,701 --> 03:56:07,290
distracted? As we were talking about
staying on the path, and I asked I,

3674
03:56:07,291 --> 03:56:10,230
that was one of the questions that I
sent to everyone and people were able to

3675
03:56:10,231 --> 03:56:13,920
pick and choose their questions.
But when you see that across disciplines,

3676
03:56:13,921 --> 03:56:17,460
and so you have everyone from say

3677
03:56:19,650 --> 03:56:21,630
David Lynch,
where Darren Aronofsky,

3678
03:56:21,631 --> 03:56:26,280
who were incredible
directors to the Dan Gables,

3679
03:56:26,400 --> 03:56:31,060
the, uh, Kelly Slater's most
decorated surfer of all time, uh,

3680
03:56:31,080 --> 03:56:35,730
to artists and investors and so on.

3681
03:56:36,660 --> 03:56:41,660
There are commonalities so you can spot
patterns and then assemble your own

3682
03:56:42,301 --> 03:56:45,240
toolkit of these first principles we've
been talking about. So, for instance,

3683
03:56:45,241 --> 03:56:47,430
one that I've been applying,

3684
03:56:47,490 --> 03:56:50,970
there are many that I've been
applying myself from the book. Uh,

3685
03:56:50,971 --> 03:56:55,330
you may have met Kyle Maynard before.
I know who he is, said I have better.

3686
03:56:55,340 --> 03:56:59,400
We have. So Kyle, incredible
guy, uh, congenital quad amputee,

3687
03:56:59,401 --> 03:57:03,240
that means he was born without arms
or legs, became a wrestler. I mean,

3688
03:57:03,241 --> 03:57:05,340
among many other things.
I mean, became a wrestler,

3689
03:57:05,550 --> 03:57:08,280
lost every match is for a season in his,
uh,

3690
03:57:08,310 --> 03:57:12,030
his dad supported him throughout it all.

3691
03:57:12,060 --> 03:57:15,900
They were accused of child abuse. He kept
competing and then he started winning.

3692
03:57:16,050 --> 03:57:18,630
And the same people who said it was
child abuse were like, oh, he isn't. Now.

3693
03:57:18,631 --> 03:57:22,970
He has an unfair advantage. Just people
can't grab his arms and legs. I was like,

3694
03:57:22,971 --> 03:57:26,940
really? Wow. What a world. And uh,

3695
03:57:27,170 --> 03:57:31,280
just a fascinating guy who has done a lot,
climbed Kilimanjaro.

3696
03:57:31,340 --> 03:57:33,290
I think he was the first
person ever to do so.

3697
03:57:33,340 --> 03:57:37,880
A quad amputee without prosthetics
carried the ashes of a, uh,

3698
03:57:38,800 --> 03:57:42,680
a fallen,
a member of our military to the top,

3699
03:57:42,681 --> 03:57:44,330
which was there one of their dying wishes.

3700
03:57:44,390 --> 03:57:49,390
And he gave a piece of advice that
he learned from a business icon,

3701
03:57:50,931 --> 03:57:55,931
which was you can't answer seven and
what that refers to is any time you are

3702
03:57:57,831 --> 03:57:59,030
rating for yourself,

3703
03:57:59,300 --> 03:58:03,320
say how important something is or how
much you want to do something on a scale

3704
03:58:03,321 --> 03:58:07,310
of zero to 10 you can't use seven.
If you're asking someone for feedback,

3705
03:58:07,370 --> 03:58:11,510
they can't use seven. Why? Because
all of a sudden now they can't choose.

3706
03:58:11,780 --> 03:58:16,520
What I realized after
reading it and is a safe,

3707
03:58:16,521 --> 03:58:20,030
comfortable, nebulous number,
and that's always seven.

3708
03:58:20,360 --> 03:58:25,360
Now you have to choose a six which is
barely better than 50% or an eight and

3709
03:58:26,660 --> 03:58:27,890
you,
you get to,

3710
03:58:27,920 --> 03:58:32,920
you accelerate your path
to better decisions almost
immediately just by adopting

3711
03:58:34,341 --> 03:58:38,480
that or the way that, say
Daniel Negreanu, fader Holtz.

3712
03:58:38,481 --> 03:58:42,440
These are two of the biggest
winning poker players of all time.

3713
03:58:42,830 --> 03:58:45,860
One in live, in person
tournaments, the other online,

3714
03:58:46,250 --> 03:58:51,050
and to look at their decision frameworks,
how they decide, how much to bet,

3715
03:58:51,051 --> 03:58:52,430
how they stake other people.

3716
03:58:53,000 --> 03:58:57,920
These are all tools that you can apply
everywhere. It's really cool stuff.

3717
03:58:58,350 --> 03:59:01,520
Uh, so yeah, travel mentors has been
a very, very fun book to put together.

3718
03:59:01,680 --> 03:59:06,300
Yeah, it's a, I've been on the road,
but one of your people sent it to me,

3719
03:59:06,301 --> 03:59:08,250
so I think it's waiting for me
at my house when I get back.

3720
03:59:08,251 --> 03:59:12,800
So I'm stoked on that one.
And what you showed me that flip through,

3721
03:59:12,880 --> 03:59:14,430
that's kind of why I know it's,

3722
03:59:14,431 --> 03:59:18,990
I'm going to be cool for people
to get again, find, find,

3723
03:59:19,350 --> 03:59:23,840
find the path, find various paths and,
and help them, guide them towards, there's

3724
03:59:25,400 --> 03:59:29,070
also run it a couple other books. One of
them is called way of the warrior kid.

3725
03:59:30,210 --> 03:59:33,270
It's about a kid who
turns into a warrior kid.

3726
03:59:34,620 --> 03:59:38,850
Best book ever. Uh, extreme
ownership book about leadership.

3727
03:59:39,430 --> 03:59:40,263
It's

3728
03:59:41,670 --> 03:59:46,140
combat leadership principles from war and
how to apply them in your business and

3729
03:59:46,141 --> 03:59:50,850
life. The discipline equals
freedom field manual. Um,

3730
03:59:51,270 --> 03:59:55,140
once again, to everyone that got
this book, including Tim. Yes.

3731
03:59:55,141 --> 03:59:59,490
Thank you for supporting it. Uh, also
the, the book because of your support,

3732
03:59:59,610 --> 04:00:02,940
it made the on New York Times bestseller
list, which is, which is pretty awesome.

3733
04:00:03,090 --> 04:00:07,560
Thank you everyone. Thank you, Tim.
Course. Um, that's awesome. And,

3734
04:00:07,620 --> 04:00:11,970
and you know the book,
it doesn't follow any formula really.

3735
04:00:12,060 --> 04:00:16,800
It's not normal. It's kind of
like this podcast is not normal.

3736
04:00:16,801 --> 04:00:19,720
It's not [inaudible] not everyone's going
to get it. Some people going to turn it

3737
04:00:20,010 --> 04:00:24,390
on this podcast and go eat. I don't
think I can listen to that. That's okay.

3738
04:00:24,480 --> 04:00:27,180
Same thing with the book.
That's okay too.

3739
04:00:27,390 --> 04:00:30,240
I'm not here to write things
that everyone likes him.

3740
04:00:30,241 --> 04:00:33,060
I'm not here to record a podcast and
everyone listens to, wants to listen to.

3741
04:00:33,150 --> 04:00:37,650
I'm okay with that. Um,
those of you that do get it,

3742
04:00:37,830 --> 04:00:40,770
thank you for forgetting it.

3743
04:00:41,690 --> 04:00:44,070
For those of you don't get it.
Why are you still listening?

3744
04:00:44,430 --> 04:00:49,380
Three and a half years later,
it's not punishing yourself there.

3745
04:00:49,460 --> 04:00:51,150
They're imposing discipline on themselves.

3746
04:00:51,180 --> 04:00:54,810
I can make it this guy's annoying
voice for another 20 minutes.

3747
04:00:56,090 --> 04:00:59,580
Like I said, the Audio version
is on empathy MP3 platforms.

3748
04:00:59,581 --> 04:01:02,430
I've been asked that 5,000
times on social media.

3749
04:01:02,431 --> 04:01:06,330
I've answered everywhere by the
way, everywhere. So that's good.

3750
04:01:06,540 --> 04:01:09,990
If you need some leadership support for
your team or for your business echelon

3751
04:01:09,991 --> 04:01:14,280
front, that's our leadership consulting
company. It's me, Leif, Babin,

3752
04:01:14,310 --> 04:01:16,020
JP to know Dave Burke,

3753
04:01:16,770 --> 04:01:21,420
info@echelonfront.com.
If you want to get it echo,

3754
04:01:21,421 --> 04:01:25,950
you got any clothing songs. That's
it. Thanks Tim. Again. Yeah.

3755
04:01:25,980 --> 04:01:26,820
Thank you gentlemen.

3756
04:01:27,000 --> 04:01:31,200
Then I use the word gentlemen loosely
if you want to keep this conversation

3757
04:01:31,201 --> 04:01:32,034
going.

3758
04:01:32,130 --> 04:01:37,130
We are actually on the interwebs
fairly heavily on Twitter,

3759
04:01:38,520 --> 04:01:43,200
Instagram and a face, a bulky,
um, echo is an echo. Charles.

3760
04:01:43,300 --> 04:01:47,490
I am at jockowillink and Tim
is at t Ferriss. Two R's,

3761
04:01:47,491 --> 04:01:52,140
two s's on Twitter,
on Instagram at Tim Ferriss.

3762
04:01:52,141 --> 04:01:56,070
Two R's, two s's on Facebook.
Tim Ferris, you got it.

3763
04:01:56,220 --> 04:02:00,390
Did I miss anything else? All right.
Tim, any closing thoughts from you sir?

3764
04:02:00,600 --> 04:02:02,430
Any closing thoughts?

3765
04:02:04,290 --> 04:02:09,290
I'll share one quote if people like quotes
that I think relates well to a lot of

3766
04:02:11,131 --> 04:02:15,990
what we talked about and certainly
Musashi and this is a quote from RK locus.

3767
04:02:16,230 --> 04:02:19,740
So by the sound of the name
you might guess it's very,

3768
04:02:19,741 --> 04:02:21,780
very old and it is,

3769
04:02:21,781 --> 04:02:25,140
we do not rise to the
level of our expectations.

3770
04:02:25,140 --> 04:02:27,210
We fall to the level of our training.

3771
04:02:28,770 --> 04:02:32,970
Hope is not a strategy as
James Cameron would say.

3772
04:02:34,830 --> 04:02:38,020
Train hard, train, train hard. Uh,

3773
04:02:38,790 --> 04:02:40,650
Tim as always,
thanks for everything.

3774
04:02:40,740 --> 04:02:45,390
I literally would not be sitting
here right now if it wasn't for you.

3775
04:02:45,870 --> 04:02:50,370
Um, and what's cool is you've helped
me out a lot, but more importantly,

3776
04:02:50,371 --> 04:02:54,360
you've helped out all kinds of people all
over the world. I think that's awesome.

3777
04:02:54,390 --> 04:02:56,910
The content that you put out,
the advice that you give to people.

3778
04:02:57,510 --> 04:03:02,510
And so thank you for what you've done
for me and thanks for what you do for all

3779
04:03:03,781 --> 04:03:07,830
kinds of people everywhere. Thank
you John. Much appreciated. Uh,

3780
04:03:08,100 --> 04:03:12,240
and while I'm thanking
people to close this out,

3781
04:03:12,241 --> 04:03:17,241
I'm want to thank the real warriors out
there better in uniform on the front,

3782
04:03:18,490 --> 04:03:21,610
holding the line against evil.
Thank you for what you do.

3783
04:03:21,611 --> 04:03:25,990
And those of you that are back
here in uniform at home, police,

3784
04:03:25,991 --> 04:03:30,640
law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,
all the other first responders,

3785
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:36,000
thank you all for keeping our homeland
safe and to everyone else that's

3786
04:03:37,511 --> 04:03:40,360
listening
this,

3787
04:03:40,361 --> 04:03:44,540
remember that the world is filled with
the sound of waves and the waves are

3788
04:03:44,541 --> 04:03:47,210
filled with little fishes.

3789
04:03:49,610 --> 04:03:51,920
Let them play,

3790
04:03:53,390 --> 04:03:57,590
let them dance.
Let them sing you.

3791
04:03:59,500 --> 04:04:04,500
You get on the path and stay on
the path and keep getting after it.

3792
04:04:08,200 --> 04:04:09,800
And until next time,

3793
04:04:10,070 --> 04:04:14,480
this is Tim Ferriss and echo and Jocko

3794
04:04:16,130 --> 04:04:16,490
out.
