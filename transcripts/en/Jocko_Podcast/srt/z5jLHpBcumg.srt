00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,860
This is Jocko podcast number
18 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,040
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,040
He who fights with monsters should be
careful lest he thereby become a monster.

4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,080
And if thou gies long into the abyss,

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,820
the abyss,
we'll also gaze into the

6
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,020
so said Nietzsche.

7
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,483
Okay.

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:46,740
And that is really what we're
dealing with here in the world.

9
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,320
In my world,

10
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,343
fighting,

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,720
fighting against a monsters.
And I'm talking about,

12
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,850
okay,

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,850
what goes on not only in the outside
world and the evil that's there,

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,120
but also when the world around
us and also inside your head.

15
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:16,010
Inside my head,
there's battles,

16
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,150
battles that can be raging

17
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,970
every minute of the day between strength
and weakness between the past and the

18
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:30,820
future,
between good and evil,

19
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,860
between light and dark, opposing
forces battling against each other.

20
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,380
And we,
we all see evil.

21
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,910
I mean,

22
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,200
of course there's those of us that have
been to war where we see concentrated

23
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:54,190
evil but evils everywhere around us,

24
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,020
around everyone.

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:01,050
Disease and crime and
murder and abuse and loss.

26
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,680
And there's predators out there.

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,160
Yeah.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,150
And there's prey
in nature and in humans.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,450
And as I've said before,

30
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,660
there's parts of the world
where we've built a nice bubble

31
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,710
where we can all but remove the evil
or at least distance ourselves from it.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,960
And in doing so,

33
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,670
we can almost almost forget about it

34
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,103
almost,

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,580
but it's a thin,
thin veneer,

36
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,103
okay?

37
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,950
And it doesn't take much

38
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:52,360
to release the demons.

39
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,750
It doesn't take much for
humanity to fall apart.

40
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,180
And that shows itself often in war,

41
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,020
which is one of those things

42
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,630
that can very quickly release the demons.

43
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,880
There are dead soldiers,
dead women, dead children.

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,950
Everyone's dead,

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,290
okay?

46
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,970
Shorn headed boys, sometimes
morose, sometimes laughing,

47
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:33,750
beaten up in our barracks were
broken jaws and ruptured lungs.

48
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,260
We were herded into this war
and killed by the hundred.

49
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,980
We didn't even know how to shoot.
We couldn't kill anyone.

50
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,070
We didn't know how all that we were
capable of was crying and dying

51
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,000
and die.
We did.

52
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,860
We called the rebels uncle and
when our boys throats were cut,

53
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,630
they begged the rebels, please uncle,
don't kill me. What did I ever do to you?

54
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,130
We so wanted to live. Get
that into your heads. You fat,

55
00:04:10,131 --> 00:04:13,250
smug generals.
Who sent us off to this slaughter.

56
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,450
We hadn't yet seen life
or even tasted it's sent,

57
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,850
but we had already seen death.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,000
We knew this smell of congealed blood on
the floor of a helicopter in a hundred

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
degree heat knew that the flesh of a torn
off leg turns black and that a person

60
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:37,151
can burn up entirely in lit
gasoline leaving just the bones.

61
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,480
We knew that body swell up in the heat
and we listened to every night to the

62
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,000
craze dogs howling in the ruins.

63
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,920
Then we started to howl ourselves
because to die at the age of 18

64
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,230
is terrifying.

65
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
We were betrayed by everyone and we
died in a manner be fitting real cannon

66
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,790
fodder silently and unfairly

67
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,370
by night. They'd kick the
living crap out of us by day.

68
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,140
We unload corpses.

69
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,110
I have no dreams in this tent and no
charred bodies chased me at night.

70
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,060
I just plunge into a dark pit where
there is nothing, not even war,

71
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,220
and I opened my eyes.
When it gets light,

72
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,300
a person changes very quickly in war.

73
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,800
He may be scared scared by a
dead body on the first day,

74
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,250
but a week later he can be
eating from a can while leaning,

75
00:05:43,251 --> 00:05:46,130
leaning on human remains
to be more comfortable.

76
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,650
That's a book we're diving into right now.

77
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,490
It's called a one soldiers

78
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,423
war.

79
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,323
Okay.

80
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,120
By R K D Bob Chanko.
He was a Russian soldier,

81
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,350
fought in both wars in Chechnya,

82
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,420
the first and the second the Russians
fought against the Chechen rebels

83
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,903
and

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,560
this is actually a book that a bunch of
people after we did a short piece in and

85
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:28,580
talked about the war in Chechnya and
the lessons learned from that war.

86
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,210
A bunch of people hit me on Twitter
and said to check out this book,

87
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:35,580
and I did and they were right.

88
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,610
It's a great narrative and it shows you
the impact of this war on the soldiers

89
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:45,360
that fought in it and once again

90
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,280
we are going to see the
veil of humanity ripped off.

91
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,930
I think it's important first to kind of
look at where these soldiers came from.

92
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,070
Back to the book here.
You won't find any smart,

93
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,050
handsome boys and these tents,

94
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,220
they were gotten out of a war by
their rich daddy's leaving it to us,

95
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:15,780
ordinary folk to die and Graziani the
ones who didn't have the money to pay our

96
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:20,760
way out. Heap Denise tents are
the sons of laborers, teachers,

97
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
peasants,
and blue collar workers.

98
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,480
Basically all of those who were made
penniless by the government's thieves,

99
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,720
thieving reforms,
and then left to waste away.

100
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,720
These tents contain the ones who didn't
know how to give a bribe to the right

101
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:41,280
person who, who thought that the army
service was the duty of every man.

102
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,430
Truth and nobility of heart are
no longer virtues in our world.

103
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,970
Those who believe in them
are the first to die.

104
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,713
Okay?

105
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,300
Now, one thing that I'm
about to get into is the,

106
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,910
the treatment of the Russian soldiers,

107
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,350
which is absolutely just gangster.

108
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:13,460
It's, it's, it's just gangsters.
The only way I can describe it,

109
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,590
the way that the soldiers were treated,

110
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:20,591
the way that the military was run was
just by brute force within the own chain

111
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:23,540
of command.
So there was no escape.

112
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,290
This is what they were dealing with.

113
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,390
So there's an unofficial set of rules,
a kind of a code of laws,

114
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,690
which if violated,
incur corporal punishment.

115
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,580
If I stuck my hands in my pockets,
I'd get a bump on the head.

116
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,140
That is the privilege of the older
soldiers, a spirit and a spirit.

117
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,380
There's what they call the new soldiers.
They call them spirits.

118
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,200
A spirits should forget
about his pockets entirely,

119
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,070
otherwise they will fill them up with
sand and sold them the sand chiefs,

120
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:59,010
the groin,
and two days later you have weeping sores.

121
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,680
You can get a beating for anything at all.

122
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,390
If a spirit doesn't show respect in his
conversation with an older soldier of

123
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,580
Grandad,
he'll get beaten up.

124
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,140
If he talks too loudly or goes about
the barracks clattering his heels,

125
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,730
he'll get beaten up if he lies on his
bed and the day he'll get beaten up.

126
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:22,200
If people back home send him good rubber
slippers and he decides to wear them to

127
00:09:22,201 --> 00:09:25,950
the shower, he'll get beaten
up and lose those slippers.

128
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,380
Okay.

129
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,310
And if a spirit even thinks of turning
down the tops of his boots are walking

130
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:36,480
around with his top button on Donner for
his cap is tip back on his head or to

131
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:41,370
one side or he doesn't do his belt up
tightly enough. Y'all thrash him so hard,

132
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,900
he'll forget his name. He is
a spirit, the lowest dregs.

133
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,940
And it is,

134
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,940
and it is his job to slave until the
older soldiers have been discharged

135
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,050
and then he goes on.
So that's sort of the,

136
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:03,110
that's sort of the basic
military situation that
they're in and that he's raised

137
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:05,530
in and that sort of the,

138
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,630
the garrison meaning not the combat
situation, but just the garrison,

139
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:14,160
the standard Russian situation.
If you're a soldier, now,

140
00:10:14,161 --> 00:10:15,480
here's the situation he's in,

141
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,800
but there is none of this in our regimen.

142
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,940
All of that stuff is just child's play.

143
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,800
It's the big leagues here.
I can walk how I like and where,

144
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:31,750
what I like and it doesn't bother anyone.

145
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,920
They beat us for completely different
reasons. Our older conscripts,

146
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,020
I've already killed people and buried
their comrades and they don't believe

147
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:45,310
they'll survive this war themselves.
So beatings here are just the norm.

148
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:51,040
Everyone is going to die anyway. Both
those doing the beating and their victims,

149
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,360
so what's the big deal?

150
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,210
There's the runway two steps from here
and they keep bringing back bodies by the

151
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,860
dozen. We'll all die here.
Everybody beats everyone.

152
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,980
The devils with three
months of service to go.

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,960
The officer's the warrant officers,

154
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,870
they get stinking drunk and
then hammer the ones below them.

155
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,480
Even the colonel's beat the majors,

156
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:17,730
the majors beat the lieutenants and
they all beat the privates and the Grand

157
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:22,120
Dad's beat. The new recruits, no one
talks to each other like human beings.

158
00:11:22,121 --> 00:11:25,510
They just smack each other in the
mouth because it's easier that way.

159
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Quicker and simpler to understand because
you're all going to bite it anyways.

160
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,880
You bitches because there
are unfed children back home
because the officer Corps

161
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,440
addled with impoverishment
and hopelessness because
the devil has three months

162
00:11:41,441 --> 00:11:46,270
left because every second man is shell
shocked because our motherland makes us

163
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,470
kill our own people,

164
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,600
our own people who speak Russian and we
have to shoot them in the head and send

165
00:11:52,601 --> 00:11:54,340
their brains up.
Walls,

166
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:58,510
crush them with tanks and tear them to
pieces because these people want to kill

167
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:02,230
you because your soldiers
arrived yesterday straight
from training and today the

168
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,240
already lying open on the airstrip as
lumped lumps of charred flesh and flies

169
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:11,080
lay eggs in there,
open eyes.

170
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,670
And because in a day the company has
reduced to less than a third and God

171
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:16,270
willing,

172
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,270
you'll stay among that third because the
one thing that everyone knows is how to

173
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,240
get drunk and kill,
kill and kill some more.

174
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,920
Because a soldier is a stinking Rach and
a spirit doesn't have any right to live

175
00:12:31,921 --> 00:12:34,770
at all and to beat him is
actually to do him a favor.

176
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,680
Okay,

177
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,360
I'll teach you what war is
about you pricks. You can have,

178
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,750
you can all have a smack in the mouth
so you don't think life is too rosy and

179
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:48,020
thank your mother that she didn't
have you six months earlier or you,

180
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,580
you'd all be dead now.

181
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,850
Everyone hates everyone
else in this regimen.

182
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,430
The hatred and madness hang over the
square like a flower black cloud.

183
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,630
And this cloud saturates
young boys with fear,

184
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,930
just like pieces of barbecue meat
being marinated in lemon juice only.

185
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:14,980
They get stewed and fear and hatred before
they get sent off to the meat grinder.

186
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,450
It will be easy.
It will be easier for us to die there.

187
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,590
So you've got some, uh, you know,

188
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,200
the things were the things you
hear me talking about all the time,

189
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,640
the camaraderie, the, the, a spree decor,

190
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,960
the Brotherhood,
all of it's just gone.

191
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,130
Now you're going to get to a point in any,

192
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:44,630
he does get to it where you get to the
frontline troopers when they're fighting

193
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,110
and they rely on each other and
they have the normal soldierly,

194
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,470
brotherly comrade love for each other.
But as a unit,

195
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,820
throughout the ranks, you can
see it's, it's, it's awful.

196
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,043
Hmm.

197
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,590
And this is before we
even get to the fighting.

198
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,450
Yeah.
Lev vanished toward evening.

199
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:16,590
He wasn't the first to go missing a couple
of weeks earlier to soldiers from the

200
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:20,410
eighth company had taken a
machine gun and tried to go home.

201
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,950
No one looked for your cove lev.

202
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,700
The storming of grass knee was underway
and second battalion tried in vain for

203
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:35,150
the third day to take the cross
shaped hospital suffering,

204
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:39,680
high casualties and we were bogged down
for the third day at the first row of

205
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,120
houses in the private district.

206
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,830
The storming operation was faltering
and we didn't have time to look.

207
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,510
They listed him as a deserter,

208
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,240
wrote off his rifle as lost in and closed

209
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,073
the case.

210
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,660
It was the old man and this
is like they're a sort of
a special police unit that

211
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:02,300
they had within the military Oman.

212
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,100
It was the Oman who turned up are missing
man during the night while they were

213
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:11,480
mopping up in the first
line in one cottage seller,

214
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,090
they found a mutilated body.

215
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,320
The rebels had slid him
open like a tin of meat,

216
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,640
pulled out his intestines and use them
to strangle him while he was still alive

217
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,040
on the neatly whitewashed walls above
him written in his blood were the words,

218
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,580
I'll Akbar God is great.

219
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,380
So now you get a little bit from the enemy

220
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,500
and we already talked about the abuse
and now we're going to get into some some

221
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:51,870
blue on blue,
some fratricide.

222
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,580
Half an hour later we got
shelled by self propelled guns.

223
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,880
I'm standing in the street with a company
commander when the first house on the

224
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:03,460
right suddenly shutters and
start to collapse in the center.

225
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,750
A huge split spreads down from
the ninth floor, balconies,

226
00:16:07,751 --> 00:16:12,160
girders and floor support spew out and
seem to hover in the air turnover and

227
00:16:12,161 --> 00:16:14,440
then drive themselves into
the ground with a thud.

228
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,820
Small debris scatters into the
yard after the heavy blocks.

229
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:21,910
We don't know what's happening
and squat down instinctively,

230
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
crawl behind a rusty shrapnel riddled
garage and look all around us than we

231
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:29,950
realize that it's friendly fire.

232
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,980
The company commander
fumbles for the headphone,

233
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,340
have the radio on my back and starts
to call it a battalion commander.

234
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,560
I crawl over to the spare radio that
standing on open ground with the commander

235
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:45,670
scrambling after me still wearing
the headphones, one after the other.

236
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,130
Him standing over my head and
me crouch between his legs.

237
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:50,650
We shout into the mouthpiece
for them to cease firing,

238
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,060
tangled up in the wires and
the headphones. We forget
all about the shrapnel.

239
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:58,630
All we can think about is reporting
that we are here and they should hold

240
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:01,810
shelling that we must
stop them from hitting.

241
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:04,990
Our guys are infantry men.

242
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,730
Pour out of the house and Stan dumbstruck
on the porches not knowing where to

243
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:10,564
run.

244
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,160
Huge hundred and 50 millimeter
shells weighing more than 60 pounds.

245
00:17:15,161 --> 00:17:19,390
Roar through the air above us
and below up the upper floors.

246
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:23,710
One blast erupts, a whole vertical
section of the building vanishes.

247
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,160
Leaving just rusty steel end trails
jutting from the shattered walls.

248
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,930
Another shell flies down the middle of
the yard and hits the House on the left

249
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:36,190
before it explodes.

250
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,170
Time loses meaning we
lie behind the garage,

251
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,640
pressing ourselves into the snow.
How long this lasts, I have no idea.

252
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,010
Finally,
it's

253
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,550
over with too seriously wounded.

254
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,630
The shell that flew down the middle of
the yard exploded right inside their

255
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:59,400
headquarters.
While two men were there,

256
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,510
the leg in one side of them was blown to
pieces and the other had both legs torn

257
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:08,040
off.
Again,

258
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:12,210
we run the wounded to the carrier on
stretchers and load them inside again.

259
00:18:12,211 --> 00:18:16,500
They make no sound except for when one
opens his eyes and says quietly get my

260
00:18:16,501 --> 00:18:17,334
leg.

261
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,430
[inaudible] picks up the severed remnants
of the leg and carries it up along

262
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,780
beside the stretcher.

263
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:31,360
Five of them carry him in pieces for
taking his torso and one his leg.

264
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,520
They load him into the carrier.
The limb is placed inside behind him.

265
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,470
The other wounded man dies.

266
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,480
Some insight here, and I think
this is, this is a striking,

267
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,250
and I remember when you're a kid,
you grow up, you watch war movies,

268
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,660
you watch war documentaries,

269
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:57,360
you watch World War II films and
they're all in black and white.

270
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,370
And sometimes people think that war is
black and white because that's what you

271
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:03,204
see.

272
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,700
Okay?

273
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,420
And he thought the same
thing and here he is.

274
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,670
I always used to think that war was
black and white, but it's in color.

275
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,471
It's not true.

276
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:20,060
What the song says that birds don't
sing and trees don't grow in war.

277
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,883
In fact,

278
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:27,290
people get killed in the midst of such
vivid color among the green foliage of

279
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:32,291
the trees under the clear blue sky and
life hums on all around the birds brim

280
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:37,910
with song. The grass blooms
with brightly colored flowers.

281
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,270
Dead people lie on the grass and they
are not a bit scary in appearance as part

282
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:45,650
of this multicolored world.

283
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,280
You can laugh and chat alongside them.

284
00:19:49,281 --> 00:19:52,190
Humanity doesn't freeze and go
crazy at the site of a body.

285
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,700
It's only frightening
when people shoot at you

286
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,400
and it's very frightening
that war is in color.

287
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,290
Talking about some of the civilians,

288
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,860
especially the mothers,

289
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,100
the mothers have at worst of all in this
war, they don't belong to either side.

290
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,280
They get brushed off from the Russian
generals or our or our soldiers shoot at

291
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:26,460
them.
And as one priest we freed from captivity,

292
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:29,940
told me the Chechens take them off
into the mountains and raped them,

293
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:32,970
killed them,
and feed their innards to their dogs.

294
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,700
They've been betrayed by everyone. These
Russian women, they die by the dozen.

295
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:43,410
Yet still they wander around
Chechnya with their photos,

296
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:45,180
searching for their sons

297
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,340
and what's happening to the sons.

298
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,450
Here's what's happening to the sons.

299
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,200
Then the Cheshin start killing our guys.
They took prisoner,

300
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,460
they shout from the end of the street
to get our attention and show a few

301
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:11,930
soldiers badly beaten and with
their hands tied behind their backs.

302
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,450
The Chechens laugh and shout something
at us and their language and then quickly

303
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,030
put one of the prisoners on his side,
on the asphalt,

304
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,840
pin his head with a foot and stab
him twice in the throat with a knife.

305
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,120
The boy jerks is tied hands and whimpers
and a black trickles spreads from a

306
00:21:33,171 --> 00:21:34,920
slash throat onto the road.

307
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,320
The Chechens go back around the corner,
leaving him to die on the asphalt.

308
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,720
He lies a long time on his side without
moving and then he starts to twitch.

309
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,350
He jerks is bound hands and tries to
turn over as if he's uncomfortable.

310
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,270
Then he falls quiet again.

311
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,460
It is painful for him to move and he
obediently lies on his side with a gaping

312
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,470
throat that keeps pumping a black trickle

313
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,610
when we think he's already dead. He
starts to twitch again and tries to crawl.

314
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,940
Then goes still again.
This goes on a long time.

315
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,510
Blood pours from his throat
and smears across his face.

316
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,950
His jacket has slipped down to his
elbows and when he jerks his arms,

317
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,310
blood spurts from an artery
on to its bare shoulder.

318
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,530
Bastards says murky,
unable to bear any longer.

319
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:37,200
He jumps up and shouts over the buildings,
just kill him.

320
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:40,770
You fuckers shooting you bastards.
Bastards.

321
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,200
He on slings,
his rifle,

322
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,410
but OCIP POV and loop
managed to grab the barrel.

323
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,140
They grip his arms and
press him to the ground.

324
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:51,890
Okay.

325
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:56,360
Murky squats holding his head in
his hands and moaning bastards,

326
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,630
bastards,
bastards to he whimpered whispers

327
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:04,020
the boys soon starts to choke.

328
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:08,190
He can't breathe and blood sprays
from his mouth as he costs.

329
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,570
Sometimes he loses consciousness
for a while and lies motionless.

330
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:15,210
Then he comes to and once
again tries to crawl.

331
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,240
When he stops moving altogether,

332
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:23,970
the chuck and shoot him in
the back with tracer rounds,

333
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,700
the bullets pass through his
body and ricochet into the sky.

334
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,100
They also kill the rest of the prisoners.

335
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:37,870
This time they don't appear from around
the corner. All we hear are screams

336
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,080
before they cut each boys throat.
They shout all Akbar.

337
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,030
We hear this several

338
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,810
times and an hour later they throw
the bodies out into the street

339
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,033
savagery

340
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,523
and

341
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,580
unfortunately savagery
breeds more savagery

342
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,570
and the downward spiral.

343
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,040
Okay,

344
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,840
of sadism
and in humanity.

345
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,340
Meanwhile,

346
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,870
stories of horrors elsewhere in
Chechnya kept filtering back to us.

347
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,060
A friend of mine told me how his
battalion entered some village or another.

348
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,380
It didn't get shelled much
and was almost intact,

349
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,660
but around the main square,

350
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,310
we're large crosses upon which
Russian soldiers had been crucified.

351
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,650
They'd been nailed up by their hands
and each had a few bullet holes in his

352
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:51,850
chest.
They had all been castrated.

353
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,780
The commander ordered them to
do a sweep through the village.

354
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,800
All the men who could be found
were herded it up into the square.

355
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,930
They were thrown down in piles and
our soldiers started to hack them up.

356
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,480
One guy pinned to cheshin to the ground
with a f with his foot while another

357
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,400
pulled off his pants and with two or
three hefty slashes severed his scrotum,

358
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,070
the serrated blade of the knife snag
the skin and pull the blood vessels from

359
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:24,904
his body

360
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,740
in half a day.
The whole village was castrated.

361
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,920
Then the battalion moved out,

362
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,630
are dead men remained on the crosses.

363
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,130
As I said,
savagery

364
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:50,190
breeds more savagery

365
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,770
and
yeah,

366
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,980
here's one of the worst parts are,

367
00:25:58,981 --> 00:26:03,350
I think this is one of the
worst parts psychologically for,

368
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,340
for this soldier,
for our Katie

369
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,130
and many of the soldiers that were
farting, fighting alongside him.

370
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,050
We don't know what we are fighting for.

371
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,700
We have no goal, no morals or
internal justification for what we do.

372
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,440
We are sent off to kill and to meet
our deaths, but we don't know why.

373
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,380
We just drew the short straw happened
to be born 18 years ago and grow up just

374
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:40,040
in time for this war and our blame

375
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,013
ends there.

376
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,100
The only thing we have is hope.

377
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:51,260
The hope that we will survive and
preserve our sense of self and be able to

378
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,300
remain human beings.

379
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,660
We all feel the adjustive at all.
We feel the injustice,

380
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,330
injustice of it all so
acutely with our 18 years.

381
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:09,090
Each one of us that survives this war
will truly believe that such evil should

382
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,410
never happen again.

383
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,120
Every shell that he had us tore
apart both the flesh and the soul.

384
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Our whole outlook on life crumbled and
collapsed beneath this demonic fire and

385
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:27,420
there was nothing to
fill the emptiness in it.

386
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,340
The only thing we have left is
ourselves and our brothers in arms.

387
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,690
All we know of life is death.

388
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,130
If anyone ever asks me,
what were you fighting for?

389
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,210
I will reply for those who
clung to the ground next to me.

390
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,250
We fought only for each other.

391
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:57,220
Our entire generation may have died in
Chechnya, a whole generation of Russians,

392
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,800
even us.
Those of us who stayed alive,

393
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,910
can they really be those same 18
year old laughing boys who wants,

394
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:07,870
got seen off to the army
by their loved ones? No,

395
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,653
we died.

396
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:12,770
Okay.

397
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:14,180
We all died in that war.

398
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,623
Okay.

399
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:27,110
Now there's a point where,

400
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,020
where are Katie, the author, he's,

401
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:35,710
they're under fire and obviously,
you know,

402
00:28:35,711 --> 00:28:40,711
he's feeling the pressure of being under
fire and there's a sniper and he thinks

403
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:44,500
he knows where the snipers, but
he isn't, he's not 100% sure.

404
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,950
He just kind of thinks, hey, I think I
saw something. And he calls for fire.

405
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,550
You know the word she directs
heavy, heavy cannons, um,

406
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,570
from some armored vehicles
towards that fire.

407
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,970
And the next day or two days later,

408
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,240
he finds out that the,

409
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,200
what happened to the people that were
killed in that was like an an eight year

410
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:10,960
old or a nine year old
girl and her grandfather.

411
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,163
Okay.

412
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,900
And so here's his thoughts on that.

413
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,063
Okay.

414
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,750
Yesterday I murdered a girl.

415
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,950
I suddenly felt sick and there
was nothing I could do about it.

416
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:32,040
There was nowhere to go and beg
forgiveness. I had murdered them.

417
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,340
And he was irrevocable.

418
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,600
Now I would be a child killer my whole
life and I'd have to live with this.

419
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:44,440
Eat, drink raised
children. Be Happy and sad,

420
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:47,890
laugh and cry. Be Ill, love

421
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,810
and and kiss.
Olga.

422
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,300
Touch this pure radiant creation
with hands that had murdered.

423
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,110
Touch her face, eyes, lips, breasts,

424
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:07,111
so tender and vulnerable and leave
greasy traces of death on her clear skin.

425
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,780
These hands, these damned hands. I
should cut them off and discard them.

426
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,270
I will never get them clean.

427
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:21,271
Now I stuck my hands between my knees
and started to rub them on my pant legs.

428
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:27,430
I understood that this was psychosis
madness, but I couldn't help it.

429
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,010
It seemed my hands.

430
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:34,630
It becomes sticky like when you've eaten
food in a dirty cafe under the sun.

431
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:40,090
Murder had stuck to them.
The vilest kind of murder

432
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,630
and I couldn't get it off.

433
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:52,700
The next day he's in the Chow Hall.

434
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,760
They're eating and one of his buddies
hands him a 10 with some oatmeal in it.

435
00:30:57,831 --> 00:31:02,000
Here, eat this. We saved
it for you. Thanks.

436
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,990
I took the tin and absently.
Started to wolf down the cold oatmeal.

437
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:07,783
Then I stopped.

438
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:12,920
Remember how the Chechens hit
us yesterday? You know what?

439
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,910
It turns out we killed a girl when we
fired back an eight year old girl and her

440
00:31:16,911 --> 00:31:17,744
grandfather.

441
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,030
Okay,

442
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:23,600
and here's the response from a whole leg.
It happens.

443
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,190
Don't think about it. It'll pass. If
you're going to put yourself through hell,

444
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:30,650
every time it happens,
you'll go out of your mind.

445
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,230
People here kill and get killed.
They kill us. We kill them.

446
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,830
I've killed too.
It's just war.

447
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,900
Our own lives aren't worth a thing here,
let alone someone else's.

448
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:48,860
Don't think about it.
At least not until you get home right now,

449
00:31:48,861 --> 00:31:52,310
you're still too close to her.
She's dead and you're alive,

450
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,460
but you're both still
rotting in one place.

451
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,640
Only she's below ground and you're above
it and the difference between you may

452
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,680
only be one day

453
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,580
now going to a another little section
where they've gone into a place called our

454
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:17,750
gun and they've got a,

455
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,420
a pretty secure perimeter
and an old factory.

456
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,410
We are halted for the fourth day in a row
at the canning factory in [inaudible].

457
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,530
It's the best place we've been so
far during our deployment and we feel

458
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,470
completely safe inside the
fence that skirts the perimeter.

459
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,090
The trouble with this war is that we are
in a permanent state encirclement and

460
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:42,620
can expect to be shot in
the back at any moment,

461
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,630
but here we are sheltered,
we relax.

462
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,680
April has arrived in the sun,
has already beating down.

463
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,650
We rock around practically naked wearing
only are caught off long Johns and army

464
00:32:57,651 --> 00:32:59,570
boots and we are,

465
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,250
we are like as brothers
and brothers we are for,

466
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:08,360
there's no one in the world closer
than emaciated soldiers with lice,

467
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,400
bitten armpits,

468
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,970
son Brown next and otherwise
white putrefying skin.

469
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,393
Yeah.

470
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,411
While he's there,

471
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:24,411
he's reflecting on some of the
things he's seen and he says,

472
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:29,760
I remember the photo we found near
shot toy of the little cheshin boy,

473
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,590
he's only about seven,

474
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,190
but he's showing off with a
rifle in his hands while as Matt,

475
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,420
while his mom stands alongside beaming,
had her little grown up son.

476
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,630
How proud she is of him.

477
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,340
So full of joy for the holy warrior
who already knows how to hold a rifle.

478
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,280
Okay.

479
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,150
There will be even greater pride in
her eyes when he severs the head of his

480
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:58,151
first Russian prisoner at the age of 17
at 20 hill attack a column and kill more

481
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:02,510
people and at 22 he'll
run his own slave camp.

482
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,640
Then at 25 they will hunt him down
from a helicopter like a wolf,

483
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,150
flush him into the open
and fire rockets at him.

484
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,680
As he darts between shell craters,
splattering has guts all over the place.

485
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,320
Then he'll lie in a puddle and
stare at the sky with half open,

486
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:22,910
lifeless eyes.
Now,

487
00:34:22,911 --> 00:34:27,590
nothing more than an object of
disgust as lice crawling to his beard.

488
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,650
We've seen warriors like
this grown up from such boys,

489
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,720
from cubs into wolves,

490
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,150
and to think my mother would have flayed
the skin from my back with a belt if

491
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:45,950
I'd ever thought to pose with a
weapon when I was a kid. Enough,

492
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,540
no sense in dwelling on this.
Now later,

493
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,850
everything later.

494
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:03,490
So we kind of talked about
the suffering that they,

495
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:08,020
the, the abuse that they're
taking from, from their own,

496
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,960
from their own military leadership.

497
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,210
We talked about the friendly
fire situation to beyond
the harden an enemy that

498
00:35:16,211 --> 00:35:21,211
gets raised to fight and on top of all
that there's nature and in disease that

499
00:35:22,181 --> 00:35:23,260
they have to deal with.

500
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,233
Okay.

501
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,620
My bleeding starts again and my long
Johns are permanently and crusted with

502
00:35:31,621 --> 00:35:34,380
blood.
We all have it.

503
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,480
Your rectum swells up and out,
several centimeters.

504
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:44,820
Half your backside hangs out and you
sit resplendent like a scarlet flower.

505
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,050
Where are we? Where are we
supposed to find wiping material?

506
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,080
We stripped the remaining scraps of
wallpaper from the store rooms and rasp at

507
00:35:55,081 --> 00:36:00,081
our poor backsides inflicting further
harm on ourselves and sending blood

508
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:05,160
gushing from our pants.
War is not just attacks,

509
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,890
trenches,
firefights and grenades.

510
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,960
It's also blood in feces
running down your rotting legs.

511
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,010
It starvation,
lice and drunk and madness.

512
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,920
It's swearing and human debasement.

513
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,270
It's an inhuman stench and clouds
of flies circling over our battalion

514
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,810
and as time goes on,

515
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,800
he's sort of starting to
feel like the end of the war.

516
00:36:34,801 --> 00:36:36,840
At least the end of his
deployment is going to come,

517
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,250
which starts to actually
intensify the fear for him.

518
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,043
Hmm.

519
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,050
I live with fear constantly. Now you
began that day and it doesn't abate.

520
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm scared all the time.

521
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,860
The fear alternately turns slowly like
a worm somewhere below my stomach or

522
00:36:57,861 --> 00:37:01,160
floods through me low
with a hot flush of sweat.

523
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,100
This is not the tension I experienced
in the mountains, but pure animal fear,

524
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,500
I can no longer sleep.

525
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,540
I don't trust the centuries and spend
most nights in the admin building or on

526
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:15,440
the parade ground.

527
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,760
I always keep my chest harness stuffed
with loaded magazines that have traded

528
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,520
for food and cigarettes.
I have about,

529
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,720
I have about 25 magazines
and it still seems to few.

530
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:32,030
I also empty a few clips of bullets
into my pockets and hang about a dozen

531
00:37:32,031 --> 00:37:36,950
grenades from my belt. It's still
not enough. If they storm us,

532
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,540
I want to be fully armed.

533
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,523
Okay,

534
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,680
and that's how he kind of finishes
out in that complete state of fear

535
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,350
and then it's over.

536
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,670
The battalion leaves for where we
are beat to be discharged for us.

537
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,030
The war is over,
it starts to rain.

538
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:11,410
The tires of the vehicles squeal on the
wet asphalt and rainbow is glimmer in

539
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:13,500
the spray thrown up by the wheels.

540
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,340
I open the hatch and stick
my face out under the rain.

541
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,180
Large drops fall straight
in evenly on my skin.

542
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:26,850
The Sun hangs heavily on the horizon
and our column cast long shadows and its

543
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:27,684
rays

544
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,210
and that's it.
Peace.

545
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,110
This warm damp is the last day of our war.

546
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,820
Shepell is dead and so many others.

547
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:49,300
I remember all of my comrades,
I remember their faces,

548
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:53,650
their names at last.
We have peace boys.

549
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,210
We waited so long for it,
didn't we?

550
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:04,150
We so wanted to meet it together to go
home and not park company until the whole

551
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,400
platoon had been to everyone else's home.

552
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,190
And even after that we would
stay together, stay together,
live as one community,

553
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,710
always close,
always there for each other.

554
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,910
Yeah.

555
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,320
What will I do without you?

556
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,410
You are my brothers given to me by
the war and we shouldn't be separated.

557
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:33,630
We'll always be together.
We still have our whole lives ahead of us

558
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,293
now

559
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:42,360
as we hear a lot about these days,
the war ended

560
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,633
okay,

561
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,040
but it wasn't over.
It wasn't over for these guys

562
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,473
and

563
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,880
at this point are,
Katie is now

564
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,670
back in his back in the
city and he's talking,

565
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:08,680
he's walking around and he's dealing with
people and you're going to see here he

566
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,420
meets up with some other veterans,

567
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:14,320
wounded veterans that are
basically on the street

568
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,580
about a million military personnel pass
through Chechnya and the 10 years after

569
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:27,020
the start of the first war in 1994
that's the population of a large city,

570
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,660
50 divisions of seasoned soldiers
who bring their philosophy,

571
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,840
the philosophy of war back to civilian
life with them when they return.

572
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,070
Yeah.

573
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,000
At the age of 18 they had already killed
men who are sometimes older than their

574
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:48,860
fathers and saw how these grown men
died from the bullets unleashed by their

575
00:40:48,861 --> 00:40:49,730
hands.

576
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,380
There were no voices of authority
and there was no god either.

577
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:00,140
They were ready for anything. There were
no women in their world, no children,

578
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,590
no old men, no sick people, no cripples.

579
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,520
There were just goals,
dangerous ones,

580
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,130
safe ones and ones with potential.

581
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,230
Three of them,
meaning three the veterans,

582
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:20,090
three of them meet and sit in the subway
near my metro station every morning.

583
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:23,000
They have five medals between them,

584
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:28,760
six crutches to artificial
limbs and one leg.

585
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,210
Okay.

586
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,310
And a common hatred for the whole world.

587
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,510
They've been coming here for a few years
now to sing songs and they are always

588
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:43,250
the same songs in the same order.
They sing terribly,

589
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,050
but that doesn't bother them.

590
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,710
They hate the people they are singing for.

591
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,180
They see the world from below and not
just because they are only have half their

592
00:41:56,181 --> 00:42:00,080
bodies left, but because half
of their souls are gone too.

593
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,000
They're closer to the spit drenched
asphalt than to people's faces.

594
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:09,620
They no longer have the strength to get
up and start a new life on plastic legs

595
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,150
and no longer wished to.

596
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,060
These young men don't want to
try to keep up with life anymore.

597
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,820
All they want is for the war to last
forever and for them to be a part of it

598
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,820
for furnishings.
One of them brought a small travel rug,

599
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,270
a small kitchen to cushion
to sit on and a tape player.

600
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,590
When two of his comrades leave,
he stays there on his own.

601
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,320
I don't know his name and it
doesn't matter. He is my brother.

602
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,680
They all are brothers
given to me by the war.

603
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,850
The whole of Moscow is
filled with such brothers.

604
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,010
There's at least one in each subway.
He spoke first.

605
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,100
Where did you fight then brother?

606
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,400
I told him then he started
to remember stuff where when?

607
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:08,410
How? He told me about getting his leg
torn off. When his carrier got ambushed,

608
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,900
a shell hit the armor by his right hip.

609
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:16,540
He didn't lose consciousness and even
saw has ripped off leg jerking and the

610
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:20,980
boot scraping on the rivets.
I didn't ask him anything,

611
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,670
just listened in silence and he calmly
spoke and without any hysterics just

612
00:43:27,401 --> 00:43:32,270
discussing life.
I don't understand this world.

613
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,650
These people, why are
they alive? What for?

614
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,850
They were given life at birth and
didn't have to pry it away from death.

615
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:46,220
Have a good life people.
But how do they spend it?

616
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:50,960
Do they want to invent a cure for aids
and build the world's most beautiful

617
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,350
bridge or make everyone happy?
No,

618
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,900
they want to rip everyone off,

619
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,390
stashed away as much money
as they can and that's it.

620
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,110
So many boys died.
Real kids.

621
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:08,180
And these people here fritter their lives
away as ignorantly as a kitten playing

622
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:13,130
with a ball and have no idea why
they are alive. Pointless people.

623
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:18,080
A whole world full of pointless people,
a lost generation.

624
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,490
And it's not we who are the
last generation, it's them.

625
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,890
Those who didn't fight, they are.
If their deaths could bring back,

626
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:30,890
just one of those boys did.

627
00:44:30,891 --> 00:44:33,330
I'd all of them without hesitation.

628
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,620
Every single one of them
is my personal enemy.

629
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:45,970
He lights a new cigarette from the stub
of his last and pours a fresh shot of

630
00:44:45,971 --> 00:44:46,804
vodka

631
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:52,360
and then he laughs easily and
his eyes flashed with hatred.

632
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,800
You can't go on enjoying yourself
while two hours flight away.

633
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,200
People are killing each other. Children
are still dying and there's starvation,

634
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,730
and yet those people are willing to pay
700 rubles for a theater ticket that's

635
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:11,400
2000 for the family just
to amuse themselves.

636
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,040
You can live for two months
and Chesney on that money.

637
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,120
I must be concussed because
I don't understand this.

638
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,100
I just can't get my head around it.

639
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,550
There's a war going on in their
country and they don't give a damn.

640
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,970
So in that case, why we shouldn't
give a damn about them either.

641
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,980
Not one of them should ever die
without knowing what war is.

642
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:42,290
I want for them to to cry out at night
and cry in their sleep and without waking

643
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,490
to dive under the bed.

644
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:49,491
When the New Year's Eve fireworks are
exploding in the yard and wine there from

645
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:51,240
terror like we did,

646
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:55,860
they are as guilty of our
deaths as those who killed us.

647
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,330
Who sent us to the slaughter.

648
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,350
Why weren't they striking in Moscow and
blocking the roads when we were being

649
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:03,640
killed and Graziani.
Why?

650
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:08,320
Why weren't they screaming and tearing
their hair out when they saw on TV?

651
00:46:08,321 --> 00:46:11,320
How dogs fed off the flesh of their boys.

652
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,240
Why was there no revolution
uprising or civil unrest?

653
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:22,410
How could they send their sons off to
this slaughter and then go and have fun,

654
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:27,070
live, drink beer and earn money
while they were dying down there?

655
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:32,320
While jets were flattening the mountains
and tearing apart children and women

656
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:37,590
when wounded Cheshin kids rotted in
sellers wrapping the stumps of their limbs

657
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,860
in rags and infection
crept across the wounds.

658
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,580
There are also guilty of these deaths.

659
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,990
We are here to get what's
ours and we are ready to kill

660
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,230
his hatred of Bates as suddenly as it
it weld over his eyes recede once again

661
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:03,110
behind a film of indifference,

662
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,240
half truths everywhere.
Half sincerity have friendship.

663
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,480
I can't accept that here in civilian
life they only have half truths and the

664
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:20,590
small measure of truth we
had in war was a big lie.

665
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,810
So many boys died and I
survived the whole time.

666
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,280
I used to wonder what for

667
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,840
they were better than
I was when I survived.

668
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,690
Surely this is not by pure chance.

669
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,440
Maybe I lived so that others remember us.

670
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:50,100
I am a reminder.
He says,

671
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,713
okay,

672
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,650
it's
obviously a,

673
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:04,971
you know,
this is,

674
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:09,971
this is psychological damage and this is
someone that is still reeling from the

675
00:48:13,521 --> 00:48:17,210
war.
And I can tell you when I,

676
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,860
when I came home from my last deployment,

677
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,473
okay.

678
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,220
You know,
I didn't feel like that,

679
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:27,090
but I understand what
he's talking about when,

680
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:31,710
when I came home from my last deployment
and knowing what great sacrifices

681
00:48:31,711 --> 00:48:35,250
Americans were making overseas,
including my friends,

682
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:40,380
I remember walking around town
in just looking at people and

683
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,933
okay,

684
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:48,010
it is difficult to make that transition
mentally back to where people care about

685
00:48:48,021 --> 00:48:53,021
the stupidest things and
you're complaining about
things that are just no human

686
00:48:53,571 --> 00:48:56,060
being should ever be given
the right to complain about.

687
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,450
And as that individual
right there was saying,

688
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:03,410
okay,

689
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:06,110
kind of what I say,
what are you doing with your life?

690
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,330
What are you doing with your life?

691
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:09,843
Hmm hmm.

692
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:14,210
Because people have paid dearly
to give you that freedom.

693
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,920
So what are you doing with it?

694
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,493
Okay.

695
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,950
And now we get the authors view

696
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,930
and you can kind of hear
his struggle as well.

697
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:37,130
No one returns from the war ever.

698
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,580
Mothers get back a sad semblance of
their sons embittered aggressive beast

699
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,930
hardened against the whole world and
believing in nothing except death.

700
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,003
Yeah.

701
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,970
Yesterday's soldiers are no
longer belong to their parents.

702
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,950
They belonged to war and only
their body returns from the war.

703
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,380
Their soul stays there,

704
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,570
but the body still comes home

705
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,460
and the war within it dies gradually
shedding itself in layers scale by scale.

706
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,000
Slowly, very slowly. Yesterday's soldier,

707
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:26,060
sergeant or captain transforms from a
soulless dummy with empty eyes and a out

708
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:30,680
soul into something like a human being.

709
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:37,740
The unbearable nervous tension ebbs
away the aggression simmers down.

710
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,830
The hatred passes the loneliness of Bates.

711
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:48,770
It's the fear that Lingus law lingers
longest of all an animal fear of death,

712
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,590
but that two passes with time.

713
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,390
Okay.

714
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,450
And you start to learn
to live this life again.

715
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,070
You learn to walk without checking the
ground beneath your feet for mines and

716
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:07,071
trip wires and step on man holes on the
road without fear and stand at your full

717
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:09,420
height in the open ground.

718
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:11,640
Yeah,

719
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,450
and you go shopping,
talk on the phone and sleep on a bed.

720
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:17,640
Okay.

721
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,180
You learn to take for granted
the hot water and the taps,

722
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:23,610
the electricity and the central heating.

723
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:28,280
You no longer jumped at loud noises.

724
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:34,830
You start to live at first because that's
how it's worked out and you've stayed

725
00:51:35,591 --> 00:51:38,470
alive. You do it without
gaining much joy from life.

726
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:42,490
You look at everything as a windfall
that came your way through some whim of

727
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:43,324
fate.

728
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,820
You lived your life from cover to cover
in those hundred 80 days you were there

729
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,540
and the remaining 50 odd years can't add
anything to that time or detract from

730
00:51:56,681 --> 00:52:00,910
it.
Then you start to get drawn into life.

731
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:03,820
You get interested in this game,
which isn't for real.

732
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,200
You pass yourself off as a fully fledged
member of society and the mask of a

733
00:52:10,691 --> 00:52:15,691
normal person grows onto you no longer
rejected by your body and those around

734
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:20,290
you think you are just
the same as everyone else,

735
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:27,620
but no one knows your real face and
no one knows that you are no longer a

736
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:31,660
person. Happy, laughing.

737
00:52:31,661 --> 00:52:34,660
People walk around you accepting
you as one of their own,

738
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,820
and no one knows where you've been,

739
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,990
but that doesn't bother to you anymore.

740
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,970
You now remember the war is some
cartoon horror movie you once saw,

741
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:50,680
but you no longer recognize
yourself as one of its characters.

742
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,770
You don't tell anyone the truth anymore.

743
00:52:53,771 --> 00:52:57,880
You can't explain what war really is
to someone who's never been there.

744
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,830
Just as you can't explain green to a
blind person or a man can't know what it's

745
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:03,970
like to give birth.

746
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:08,530
They simply don't have the
necessary sensory organs.

747
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,490
You can't explain or understand war.

748
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,270
All you can do is experience it.

749
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:18,310
Okay?

750
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:21,700
You're still waiting for something all
these years. God knows what though.

751
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:26,340
You simply can't believe that it ends
just like that. Any consequences,

752
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:32,010
you're probably waiting for someone to
shed some light on at all for someone to

753
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:35,040
come up to you and say, brother,
I know where you've been.

754
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,660
I know what war is and I know
what you've been fighting for.

755
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:46,250
That's very important to know why
and what for why the brothers,

756
00:53:46,291 --> 00:53:50,400
the war gave to you had to die.
Why people were killed,

757
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,140
why they were fired on goodwill,
justice, faith and love,

758
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:57,450
crushed children and bombed women.

759
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,920
Why the world need to lose that girl I
saw on the runway with her smashed head

760
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,130
and a bit of her brain lying
in an ammo box next to her.

761
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,980
Why?
But no one tells you.

762
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:20,770
And then you yesterday's soldier,
sergeant or captain,

763
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:22,960
start to explain it to yourself.

764
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:27,970
You take a pen and paper and produce
the first phrase. As you start to write,

765
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,210
you still don't know what it'll be.

766
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,020
A short story or a poem or a song.

767
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,770
The lions come with difficulty.

768
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:43,390
Each letter tearing your body like
a shard being pulled from a wound.

769
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:49,510
You feel this pain physically as the
war comes out of you and dawn to paper

770
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,400
shaking you so that you can't see the
letters you are back there again at death.

771
00:54:54,401 --> 00:54:56,620
Once them once more rules,
everything.

772
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,960
The room fills with moaning and fear.
And once again, you hear the big guns,

773
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:06,250
the screams of the wounded and people
being burned alive and the whistle of

774
00:55:06,251 --> 00:55:08,950
mortar shells falling
towards your prone back,

775
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,230
the dead rise from their graves
and form up a great number of them.

776
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,780
Every one who is dear
to you and was killed,

777
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,250
you can already spot the familiar faces.
Igor Vaseline.

778
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,200
Four i's the platoon commander.

779
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:29,730
They lean towards you and whisper and
they're whispering. Fills the room.

780
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,870
Go on brother.
Tell them how we burned in the carrier's.

781
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:39,110
Tell them how we cried in surrounded
checkpoints in August of 1996 how we

782
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:42,780
whimpered and begged them not to kill
us as they pinned us to the ground with

783
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,370
their feet and slit our throats.

784
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:48,150
Tell them how boys' bodies
twitch when bullets hit them.

785
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:53,630
You survived only because we died there.
Go on.

786
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,740
They should know all this.

787
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,700
No one should die before
they know what war is

788
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:05,680
and tinge with blood.

789
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,360
The written words appear
one after the other.

790
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,870
Vodka is down by the pint.

791
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,790
While death and madness sit behind besides
you nudging you and correcting your

792
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:22,550
pen,
and there you are.

793
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:26,200
Yesterday's soldier,

794
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:31,230
sergeant or captain can cost a
hundred times shot to pieces,

795
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:36,100
patched up, reassembled,
half crazed and stupefied.

796
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,240
And you write and write and wine with
helplessness and sorrow and tears pour

797
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:43,960
down your face and stick into your stubble

798
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,770
and you realize

799
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,270
that you should not have
returned from the war.

800
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:14,230
And that is,

801
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:18,913
yeah,

802
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,730
where the book closes

803
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,340
and those,
those are the demons.

804
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:31,930
Those are the demons.
Why did I survive?

805
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,740
Why not them?
What about the innocence we killed?

806
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:38,470
Am I good for anything else besides war?

807
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,290
And it's not just a war
that brings out demons.

808
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,370
Life does

809
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:57,450
stress and mayhem and accidents
and crime and madness and loss.

810
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,770
Those are demons

811
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,210
that attack,
that attack your soul,

812
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,193
okay?

813
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:18,060
And there's a saying
and it's something like,

814
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:24,570
if I kill all my demons,
did my angels,

815
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,850
they die too.

816
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,630
And I say,
no.

817
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:41,970
I say,
do not kill your demons,

818
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:43,560
okay.

819
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:48,220
Instead
understand them,

820
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,343
know them.

821
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,500
It's one of the oldest tenants of war.
You have to know your enemies too.

822
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:57,880
You can defeat your enemy.

823
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,880
And the best trick the devil can play
is to make you think he's not there.

824
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,470
And that's what these do demons do.
They hide deep.

825
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,100
They pick away at you
and they set up on you.

826
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,000
But don't pretend that
the demons aren't there.

827
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,170
You've got to know him.
You got to understand them.

828
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,240
Bring them in, hold them
close, hold them tight

829
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:37,610
so you can control them

830
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,920
so you can recognize their form and
their presence and their actions.

831
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:54,520
And when I read about those soldiers
living in the streets, barely living,

832
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:02,270
lost on alcohol and drugs, I
think, at least in my mind,

833
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,140
it's not because they
surrendered to the demons,

834
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,210
okay?

835
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:13,680
It's because they didn't see them.
They didn't know that they were there.

836
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:17,190
They didn't recognize them
and they got ambushed.

837
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:19,303
Okay?

838
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:22,560
And in fighting
you own fighting.

839
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,380
It's the punch that you don't
see that knocks you out.

840
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:30,410
And in war, it's the ambush that
you don't see that kills you

841
01:00:33,310 --> 01:00:38,310
and in your mind it's got to be
the thoughts that you don't see.

842
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,660
The things that you don't
acknowledge that you try to ignore.

843
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:45,230
The ones that you try and say aren't
there that you don't admit to.

844
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,910
Those are the ones that get you.
Those are the ones that drag you down.

845
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,670
Those are the ones that make you weaker,
that control you,

846
01:00:56,140 --> 01:01:01,140
pull you into a bottle of pills or
of booze or into rage or depression.

847
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:11,240
When you see an alcoholic or a drug
addict or someone that has some f'ing

848
01:01:12,211 --> 01:01:13,440
dragging them down,

849
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:20,620
it's often because they failed to truly
admit that that demon is there and that

850
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:23,660
demon has control over them

851
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,910
and they fail to recognize that
they can control the demon.

852
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:39,200
I see no, your enemy,

853
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:46,010
no your demons and that way
you can control them and
fight them and keep them at

854
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:52,200
bay
and you don't need to kill them.

855
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:56,340
In fact, I don't even know if you
can kill them. They're part of you.

856
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,630
They're part of what makes you you.
They're part of what makes me me.

857
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,940
I don't want to kill them
because if I killed my demons

858
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,900
then maybe I kill my angels as well.

859
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:19,230
What you need to put them in their place.
You need to control,

860
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:25,010
keep those demons in check
so they don't sneak up on you

861
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:33,490
and nash.
It ended up controlling you.

862
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,830
And there's one more piece to this.

863
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:46,010
The stronger that you get,
the weaker the demons get,

864
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:50,180
the more you control them,
the easier they are to control.

865
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:58,650
It just takes that awareness and that
ownership and that recognition and the

866
01:02:58,961 --> 01:03:00,130
mindset

867
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:10,770
so that you can live your
life as you should in control

868
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:14,950
and on your terms.

869
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,133
Okay.

870
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:21,700
Not on the terms of the
demons in your head.

871
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:28,540
So
see them

872
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,170
and watch them and control them.

873
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:36,763
Okay.

874
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,773
Own them

875
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:44,180
and then live your life.

876
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:55,693
No,

877
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,773
once again,

878
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,880
it appears that I have
gone to that dark place.

879
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,240
Yeah. Who recommended that book, by the
way? Do you remember? Yeah, I, I'll, I'll,

880
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:10,470
I'll have to figure it out.
But you know,

881
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:14,010
I think part of that in,
you know,

882
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:17,730
you and I were talking prior
to this and I had to tell you,

883
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:23,170
you know, this is part of me. I,

884
01:04:23,190 --> 01:04:27,660
I've attempted to sit down a couple of
times with the big positive podcasts and

885
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:28,500
I'm sure we will,

886
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,313
but

887
01:04:32,170 --> 01:04:34,300
I got some demons in there
too that are talking.

888
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:35,680
Yeah.

889
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,860
And this is what they're drawn to.
And I want to face him.

890
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,030
I want to face him,
I want to look at them,

891
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:46,780
I want to go toe to toe with them.

892
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:54,090
And another thing is as
both full soldiers said,

893
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,530
people shouldn't get to live
without knowing what war is like.

894
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:05,060
Because until you know what war is like,

895
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:09,920
or at least until you open your
mind to understand what it is,

896
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,710
where it comes from,
what it does to people,

897
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,170
then that's a whole,

898
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,380
it's a whole part of humanity
that you're not seeing.

899
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:21,910
And it's the darkest part.

900
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:26,280
And you got to recognize that,

901
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:31,320
especially because if you don't recognize
that that darkness is there again,

902
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,260
you're not going to see the
beauty you have in your own life.

903
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:42,030
And you know what? That was dark and
that was deep. And you know what?

904
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,470
In the next 10 minutes, you and I
are gonna be laughing at something.

905
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:50,820
We're going to be Jim joined something.
We're gonna have some fun.

906
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:53,760
And I think in that respect,
the podcast,

907
01:05:55,310 --> 01:06:00,310
it reflects life because life has ups
and downs and has misery and it has

908
01:06:02,661 --> 01:06:03,171
sadness.

909
01:06:03,171 --> 01:06:08,030
And it also has font and it has
laughter and that's what reality is.

910
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:16,360
And all those pieces for me that struggle,

911
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:19,360
the struggle and the pain

912
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:26,230
that is life. That is the
education. That's the reward,

913
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:31,600
that experience that you get,
that's what makes you better.

914
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,500
And I think that's why
we keep ending up here.

915
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:50,370
We don't dwell there and I don't dwell
there and I don't think people should

916
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:51,634
dwell there.

917
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:56,560
That's one of the best
things about recognizing when
you've got these things in

918
01:06:56,561 --> 01:07:00,220
your head. If you try and ignore them,
they stay there when you face them.

919
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,390
Guess what?

920
01:07:01,390 --> 01:07:04,960
I can move on and in 10 minutes you
and I are going to be laughing about

921
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:08,390
something. I don't know
what yet. Probably at you.

922
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,730
Mm hmm. There we go. We're already there.

923
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,950
The demon for the night has
been faced, my friend. Yeah.

924
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:19,463
Okay,

925
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:24,570
so now let's get to the good stuff.
To the light,

926
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:29,610
the Internet stuff, the Internet stuff.

942
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:31,280
this book right here,
the book that I read tonight,

943
01:08:31,490 --> 01:08:34,900
I know it was a hardcore book and
it was real deep and dark in it's,

944
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:39,740
it's tough read, uh, mentally. But it's
also a great read. I forgot to say this.

945
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,920
The book is called one soldiers war.
I said it, but I said it briefly.

946
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:44,030
I'm saying it clearly now.

947
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:49,210
One soldiers war by our Katie Bab Chanko
eats a great book and go to Amazon and

948
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,440
buy it because it's, it's just, uh,

949
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:58,400

your eyes to a part of the world that

950
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:01,550
most people try to ignore and I
don't believe you should ignore it.

951
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:05,210
So check that out and you can buy the
best you put the rest of the books on the,

952
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:10,880
I'm starting to put the back. Oh,
we're lagging a little bit like,

953
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,910
and that's my fault because I didn't
make it clear enough that you know that

954
01:09:13,911 --> 01:09:17,240
that was important. Yeah, that's
absolutely true. It is not your fault.

955
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:22,520
And this one will be up there. That
one is up there. Put it that way.

piece of that, which is awesome.

961
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:41,330
It's a good way to
support the, uh, websites.

962
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:46,330
We can buy camera equipment and so we
can buy new knives to put on the desk.

963
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,390
Actually we have a very good supply.
Knives,

964
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:55,260
got a bunch of cold steel knives they
sent out, which are awesome. Yes. Um,

965
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,540
and then yeah,
there it is.

966
01:09:56,541 --> 01:10:00,650
And if you want to further
support the podcast,

967
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:02,970
you can get some shirts if you like,
if you think they're,

968
01:10:03,050 --> 01:10:06,660
they're cool and need where discipline
equals freedom. That a cool,

969
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:10,240
and when the was head on it, it says good
backwards when you're looking at here.

970
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:15,790
So I was talking to a guy
and was basically saying,

971
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:19,130
hey, listen man, you know,
we were going back and forth.

972
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:23,030
We were texting and I
forget what started it off,

973
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:26,360
but it was something along the lines
of, you know, you've got, you know,

974
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:30,530
you got to just put your ego in check
here. And he said something like,

975
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:33,830
you know, we all need to put
her on. I said, oh no. He said,

976
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:35,750
I gotta put my ego in
check, ego in check. I said,

977
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:38,690
we all got to put her ego in check.
I go, I get to work on that too.

978
01:10:38,691 --> 01:10:41,720
Of course we always do. And he said, yeah,

979
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:46,730
and I'm not the one that has a t shirt
with my face on it. And I said, yeah,

980
01:10:46,731 --> 01:10:51,140
you're also not the one that wrote a 300
page book about yourself and who has a

981
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:54,500
podcast that's named after.
That's just your name.

982
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,980
So believe me,
we all got to work on it.

983
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,660
Well that shirt thing is different
because I made the shirt like that was my

984
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,840
idea to put this shirt like that.
And then, and then the, the bumpers,

985
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:08,420
the president.
But if you haven't seen those yet,

986
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:13,860
Echo made Jocko 2016 bumper stickers.
So yeah,

987
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,390
I did it for the greater good. I
guess that's, uh, I guess that's cool.

988
01:11:18,391 --> 01:11:22,020
I wonder what kind of cars are those
going to be on? Are they going to be on,

989
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:27,150
you know, Volkswagens. Are
they going to be on a Mercedes?

990
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:29,520
So who's going to put those on? What
are we going to see? I think we've seen,

991
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:34,680
I think we see Fords and Chevys
maybe for the most part. Yeah.

992
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:36,690
Oh sure. Yeah. I don't know.

993
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:39,800
Get some European
vehicles in their t three.

994
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,360
We'll see you pretty good nonetheless.

995
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:46,850
If you want a bumper sticker on your car,
whatever kind of car you got,

996
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:51,990
um, you can get though that Jocko,
store.com as well. Um, yeah, sure.

997
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:55,260
It's bumper stickers, all this stuff if
you want them. All right, let's go. Cool.

998
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:59,840
First Question
Jacko.

999
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:04,470
As someone who has been getting after it
for as long as for a long time and has

1000
01:12:04,471 --> 01:12:08,030
incurred injuries along the way,
I see that you're a fan of MobilityWOD.

1001
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,930
I've been into star at
stuff for a while myself.

1002
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,960
Do you have any perspective
on the difference that
mobility inform can have on

1003
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,720
performance, not just on
addressing or preventing injuries?

1004
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:25,160
Did you encounter any material
like this on your younger days,

1005
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:30,080
in your younger days as a seal at an
age when a lot of younger guys will just

1006
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:35,081
slam through things as someone who is
still very active in your forties I'm

1007
01:12:35,241 --> 01:12:36,074
curious,

1008
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:41,260
I'm curious to hear what your thoughts
are versus how your 20s self was.

1009
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:43,333
Well,

1010
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:47,600
so the first part of the question
about form and technique and mobility

1011
01:12:47,660 --> 01:12:51,830
affecting performance. Absolutely.
I mean technique these king, right?

1012
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:54,380
In any sport, and it's funny
when you break into a new sport,

1013
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,650
you realize how important technique
is because you think I can do that.

1014
01:12:57,740 --> 01:13:00,230
And then you try it and you go,
Whoa, there's a lot of technique.

1015
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:01,700
Jiu Jitsu is a classic example,

1016
01:13:01,701 --> 01:13:04,880
but any sport that you play that
looks like it's not that hard,

1017
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:09,560
you go ahead and try it. You realize how
much of a s every sport is technique.

1018
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:11,450
So technique is absolutely important.

1019
01:13:11,451 --> 01:13:16,370
Mobility is also important and it'd being
able to move well and move smoothly.

1020
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,560
You know, there's that whole, I don't
know if it's a trend going on right now,

1021
01:13:21,561 --> 01:13:25,550
but this idea of movement training, you
know, it's the same thing. You know, how,

1022
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,600
how are you going to move? Well,
how do you move your body well?

1023
01:13:29,601 --> 01:13:33,590
So mobility is absolutely going to
make you a better performer. Now,

1024
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:37,940
when I was younger
did,

1025
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,060
I mean we just did not do this stuff.
It was just merciless,

1026
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:46,260
no stretching, bad diet, no mobility.

1027
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:51,420
And when we were sore or whatever,
we just just were sore.

1028
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:56,250
I mean, that was it. Um, and, and,

1029
01:13:56,251 --> 01:14:00,060
and looking back,
I wish we knew more of that stuff.

1030
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,060
We just didn't know it at the time.
Maybe people knew it. I didn't know it.

1031
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:07,080
My buddies didn't know it.
We just did what we did.

1032
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:11,560
We just worked out hard and just dealt
with the pain. And when we were sore or,

1033
01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:15,490
or had an injury, we just sucked
it up and just drove through it.

1034
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:18,520
And I'm sure that's not good.

1035
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:23,230
So I think there should definitely
be a focus on this kind of stuff. Um,

1036
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:28,420
and it, you know, I think with one
of the thing that's, I think like me,

1037
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:33,400
I need more focus on that because I,
I don't know enough mobility work.

1038
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,480
I done enough for stretching.

1039
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:37,960
Nevermind let's a mobility is like
a moderate and a stretching. Right.

1040
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:40,950
And that's what actually, you know,
you know Eddie Bravo who's a Jujitsu,

1041
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:44,770
if you don't know who that
is, that Jujitsu black belt,
really a creative game.

1042
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:49,720
But he won't give somebody their black
belt unless they can do the lotus cit,

1043
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,990
which is crazy. I mean, I can't
come close to doing a lotus sit,

1044
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:57,110
which when you put your feet on
top of your thighs and he's told,

1045
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,500
I've heard him talk a couple
times about, um, you know,

1046
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:03,370
guys that were completely inflexible,
big football players. And then he's like,

1047
01:15:03,371 --> 01:15:05,200
hey, you know, you can't get your
black belt or you can do let us,

1048
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:08,320
and these dudes just put their
mind to it and can do it.

1049
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:11,350
So just like anything else,
you need to set some goals.

1050
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:16,000
I don't think I'm quite willing to step
out onto the, I'm going to do a lotus,

1051
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,970
but who knows.
Maybe that's not money,

1052
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:21,130
just sat in the sand and
or and make it happen.

1053
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:26,260
And I think though I think things can,
all people can go too far with that stuff.

1054
01:15:26,261 --> 01:15:27,490
And I've said this before,

1055
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:33,130
like some of that extreme yoga where
you're just tying yourself in knots and

1056
01:15:33,131 --> 01:15:36,520
going beyond what a human is supposed
to be able to do and that's not,

1057
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,610
I don't believe that's good for you.
And I have a couple friends.

1058
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:42,210
I have one friend in particular
that was a hardcore yoga guy.

1059
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:46,750
He was in the seal teams.
He got out hardcore yoga guy and,

1060
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,700
and he said it,

1061
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:52,360
he said he believes it caused a lot of
problems when he got older in his back

1062
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:55,840
and his spine and his neck and his joints.
Cause you develop laxity,

1063
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:59,590
develop looseness,
you have a higher probability.

1064
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:04,360
So I think you should stretch
and be capable of the full
range of motion of what

1065
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:08,560
a normal,
well oiled human should be able to do.

1066
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:14,110
I think once you start putting your
arms, you know, backwards, upside,

1067
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:16,930
down and behind and between your
legs and then back up again,

1068
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:18,460
I think you're going to
have issues with that.

1069
01:16:18,910 --> 01:16:23,910
I also think I do get some mobility
from the workouts that I do from,

1070
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,980
I do deep squats, right? I go
all the way down on squats.

1071
01:16:26,981 --> 01:16:31,390
I do a lot of overhead squats. I do
muscle ups, I do full range of motion,

1072
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:35,410
pull ups and dips. I'm getting that
movement, doing surfing, Jujitsu. I mean,

1073
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:39,430
you're constantly, you gotta stay,
you gotta keep moving, you know?

1074
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:41,200
That's what I think you gotta do.
You gotta keep moving.

1075
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:45,550
You got to move in ways that are varied
and in make you move in different

1076
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:47,620
directions. Running,
swimming, surfing, Jujitsu,

1077
01:16:47,950 --> 01:16:51,130
all different kinds of working on just
getting after it basically. You know,

1078
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:55,780
and that's another thing that I did
write down here as a note is, man,

1079
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:59,710
when I was younger, w w we just
didn't tap that often in the Jujitsu.

1080
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:02,800
And you know you,
everybody asks me every,

1081
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,400
everybody that hits me up on Twitter
and says first day of Jujitsu class

1082
01:17:06,401 --> 01:17:10,040
tomorrow, what's, what's your advice?
My advice is tap early and tap

1083
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,530
often because your ego,

1084
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,650
if you let your ego control
the tapping mechanism,

1085
01:17:15,651 --> 01:17:19,130
you're going to get hurt and it might not
be instant. Like my neck is jacked up.

1086
01:17:19,131 --> 01:17:22,070
I've had neck surgery
that's from dean lister,

1087
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,050
that's from being in a gay teens and not
tapping and being in arm chokes and not

1088
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:27,411
tapping.

1089
01:17:27,411 --> 01:17:30,680
And that's from 20 years of not tapping
to that stuff because I can take a

1090
01:17:30,681 --> 01:17:34,430
pretty good joke. So it's cool that
you didn't happen, you got out,

1091
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,790
but after 20 years, guess
what? You got some neck damage,

1092
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:41,420
sun and it's not to get it written
originally in Bud. That definitely,

1093
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:45,260
definitely buds had something to do
with it too, but just wear and tear.

1094
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:49,730
But the additional wear and tear from
from Jujitsu definitely, you know,

1095
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:52,820
I think had a little something to do
with it, which was all unnecessary.

1096
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:57,260
It was just, Hey, I'm not going to
tap to this choke. It hurts my neck.

1097
01:17:57,290 --> 01:18:01,460
I hear some noises in there, but I'm
not tapping to it. It's not smart. Yeah.

1098
01:18:01,461 --> 01:18:06,461
Especially those neck ones because there
is an element of pain tolerance that

1099
01:18:06,621 --> 01:18:08,660
can help you in the next stuff.

1100
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:14,290
But you get an Armbar as a new guy and
then you're rolling with another guy

1101
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:16,220
who's kind of new,
but he might know how to do the arm bar.

1102
01:18:16,221 --> 01:18:20,480
He might be kind of spasming going hard
and unnecessarily because he doesn't

1103
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:24,200
know the control yet. And
if you don't tap, really,

1104
01:18:24,201 --> 01:18:28,550
that's when you're getting get jammed
up. Tap early in, tap off in people.

1105
01:18:29,270 --> 01:18:32,420
Or if he start tapping right when
you feel the pain, that's wrong too.

1106
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:36,560
Because a lot of times guys will put you
in it and it's kind of understood that

1107
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:39,320
boom, you're locked in, you know
you're not going to anywhere.

1108
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:41,660
So they kind of expect the tap. You
don't tap think, I might think, oh,

1109
01:18:41,661 --> 01:18:45,170
I'm not doing it right or I'm not a,
he has more flexibility as one thought.

1110
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:48,890
One thought only crank
harder. Do it harder. Exactly.

1111
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,800
Especially if it was locked in. So
it's like, all right, and then boom,

1112
01:18:51,801 --> 01:18:54,320
you're hurt and not good raw deal.
Not good

1113
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,170
as far as flexibility though.
Um,

1114
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,900
and Eddie Breville actually said
this in a way where, you know,

1115
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:07,790
little kids like little babies, two years
old behind their heads, no problem. Yeah.

1116
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:10,070
But for the most part,
but they're not going to do this weird Yo,

1117
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:12,770
you know how like some guys are there
like double jointed or something.

1118
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,480
They won't be able to
do that kind of stuff.

1119
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:19,481
But so put loosely these two year olds,

1120
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:23,570
they have full flexibility and you just
lose it over time. As you gain muscle,

1121
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:26,990
you gain rigidity as your, you know,
everything gets stronger and stuff.

1122
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:30,830
And if you don't put your body through
those motions, you just kind of lose it.

1123
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,950
So let's say if you were
into stretching for,

1124
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:36,760
from the beginning of the genetics
will play a part in that, um,

1125
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,420
how stretchy you can be,

1126
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:43,460
but so in a way you can get back there,

1127
01:19:43,461 --> 01:19:46,880
you just kind of work on getting
that works. Let's just like anything,

1128
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:51,350
any workout. Yeah. But yeah, pushing it
too far seems kind of weird because like,

1129
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:52,680
yeah, let's say, I don't know what,

1130
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:56,840
you can stretch your shoulder way behind
your back, like way behind your back.

1131
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:59,060
You don't have any really
real strength there.

1132
01:19:59,350 --> 01:20:02,540
But meanwhile it's so easy to be back
there and you know, and I don't know,

1133
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:07,070
it does, it seems like your joints kind
of get rigid for to be stronger. Right?

1134
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,070
I agree.

1135
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,150
It's a bone before. Yeah, I
agree. Support. Next question.

1136
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:18,870
How did the seals deal with fatigue,

1137
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:23,900
soreness and beat down and the beat
down of buds and SQT without getting

1138
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:28,920
injured? Well, you just get used
to it. And, and again, you know,

1139
01:20:28,921 --> 01:20:31,470
I say this all the time buds and the SQT,

1140
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:34,080
which is the kind of the initial
training after you get done with buds,

1141
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:36,150
which is the basic underwater
demolition seal training,

1142
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:39,120
that's a short part of your career.
I mean,

1143
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:42,220
it's literally a fraction of
your career means nothing. Um,

1144
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:47,100
but just like any working out,
you get used to it.

1145
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:50,820
And if it's like when you work out,
when you,

1146
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:54,150
if you haven't worked out for a long
time or someone that's someone that just

1147
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:56,700
starts working out from nowhere,
never worked out before,

1148
01:20:56,701 --> 01:21:00,180
they're going to be sore as a
hell when they first work out.

1149
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:04,230
I just had this happen to me cause
I got, I won, I went on the road,

1150
01:21:04,231 --> 01:21:07,380
I went on a road trip, multiple backed
back road trips that I went overseas,

1151
01:21:07,381 --> 01:21:09,750
came back when I came back I got sick.

1152
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,840
So I was for like three weeks,

1153
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:16,920
I hadn't squatted heavy at all.
I had nobody at,

1154
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:20,760
all I did was bodyweight squats,
you know, pistols, just lunges.

1155
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:23,610
That's how I worked my legs. There's just
no way. So you just do what you can do,

1156
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,310
you know,
hotel room in some strange part of Europe.

1157
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:30,870
And when I came back I was all happy
and I got on that squad. Once I,

1158
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:35,250
then I was sick and then once I got
done being sick, I finally felt good.

1159
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:37,890
I got back on that squat rack and man,

1160
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,570
my legs were destroyed
for four or five days.

1161
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:45,960
I'm talking, you know, having
a hard time sitting down,

1162
01:21:45,961 --> 01:21:50,130
having a hard time standing
up. It was gnarly. And, but,

1163
01:21:50,131 --> 01:21:53,370
but that's just because my body just,
it just wasn't,

1164
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,340
it lost that element.

1165
01:21:56,790 --> 01:22:00,840
So of course if you just started working
out and you're walking around sore all

1166
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:05,610
the time, that's, that's, that's
because you got to get used to it. Um,

1167
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:10,560
and in buds you do get injured just
because it's massively repetition.

1168
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:13,440
You know, there was a guy that
we had that was a trainer,

1169
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:16,830
an athletic trainer for a
professional sports team. And

1170
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,490
when he was there,
there's a great example,

1171
01:22:20,491 --> 01:22:23,970
there's something called Patella femoral
syndrome, which is when your Patella,

1172
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:26,340
because of the way you're running,
it rubs on your,

1173
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,710
your femur and it becomes problematic.

1174
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:34,460
And he said in like a whole season in the
NFL or he would see maybe one of those

1175
01:22:39,270 --> 01:22:42,540
injuries may be too,
and you'll have to figure out what it is.

1176
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:47,760
And when he was working in buds,
he would literally see 30 of those a week.

1177
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:51,660
So you just get to see, I mean there's
more people, there's 10 times the people,

1178
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:54,450
but it still was massive
amount of injuries.

1179
01:22:54,451 --> 01:22:56,550
And it's the same thing in the
seal teams and the seal teams.

1180
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:00,420
It's your shoulders, it's your back,
it's your knees, it's your ankles,

1181
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:05,170
you get abused and it's,

1182
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,100
it's not the working out that does
it to you. It's not working out.

1183
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:12,310
It's carrying a guy on your shoulder,
over the rocky terrain,

1184
01:23:12,311 --> 01:23:15,760
out in the desert and tripping on
ankle bats. What? You get hurt,

1185
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:20,230
it's jumping over off of a wall and you
land on a cinder block that breaks and

1186
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:21,220
you bro, you know, it's,

1187
01:23:21,221 --> 01:23:25,780
that's the kind of stuff the working
out doesn't really do it to you.

1188
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:31,510
I actually, wow. One of the things
when, when I was a tasking to commander,

1189
01:23:31,511 --> 01:23:36,460
we were going through land
warfare training and I would
work out every day and I

1190
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:40,030
would roll with guys like teach them
some Jujitsu and enroll with them.

1191
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:42,640
And I would, you know,
guys are, cause you know,

1192
01:23:42,641 --> 01:23:45,220
we're working hard during
the day or during the night.

1193
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:49,870
And I was kind of making fun of some guys
that were taking Motrin and I was like,

1194
01:23:49,871 --> 01:23:53,890
you don't need that. You're weak.
And stuff like that. And sure enough,

1195
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:55,330
right after we got done,

1196
01:23:55,331 --> 01:23:59,620
I got something called Bursitis in
my elbow because in land warfare,

1197
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:01,600
you're constantly getting down to
the desert. You're crawling, you're,

1198
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,930
and then I was in Jiu Jitsu on the mat
and I just banged it a couple of times

1199
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:08,920
and sure enough, my elbow swelled
up and I had to take Motrin.

1200
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:13,900
Yeah, don't, uh, don't
open your mouth Jocko.

1201
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:19,270
Just keep it to yourself.
Um, so, you know, and again,
I was, I was hammering guys,

1202
01:24:19,271 --> 01:24:22,430
but in a joking manner. And so they
hammered me right back when I had the,

1203
01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:27,310
the Motrin pills to try and
heal that up. Um, but it is,

1204
01:24:27,311 --> 01:24:28,630
like I said, it's the, it's the,

1205
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:32,920
the injuries come from not
from working out. In fact,

1206
01:24:32,980 --> 01:24:37,690
I always think that the working out
prevents the injuries. You know,

1207
01:24:37,720 --> 01:24:40,540
that I think that's true with everything.
I think that's true with Jujitsu.

1208
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:43,750
I think that's true with life. You,
you, you work out, you're strong.

1209
01:24:43,751 --> 01:24:47,530
You're joints are strong, you, your muscle
density is better. Your, I mean, just,

1210
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,000
just work out because it'll prevent
injuries more than more than I don't worry

1211
01:24:52,001 --> 01:24:54,370
about, I look at working out,
not as is going to happen.

1212
01:24:54,371 --> 01:24:56,140
I look at working at it
as injury prevention.

1213
01:24:56,950 --> 01:25:01,950
And the last thing is you shouldn't need
to like completely crush yourself every

1214
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:06,610
day in your workouts.
I mean,

1215
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:10,000
you shouldn't be going to a point that
you have massive muscle soreness over

1216
01:25:10,001 --> 01:25:14,410
your whole body or over even body parts.
You don't need to do that.

1217
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:19,060
You don't need to do that. Uh, you know,
do you want to push yourself? Yeah.

1218
01:25:19,061 --> 01:25:19,811
You want to push yourself,

1219
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:24,130
but you want to be so sore that you
aid like can't perform your job.

1220
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:30,010
Uh, and also I like, you
know, active rest, you know,
I hardly ever just do nothing.

1221
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,900
Occasionally I will
occasionally I'll just, man,

1222
01:25:31,901 --> 01:25:36,580
I'm broke down and just
eat steak and just chill.

1223
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:41,740
But, uh, but I like to do the active rest,
you know, I like to do some kind of jogs,

1224
01:25:41,741 --> 01:25:45,730
swam, surf, whatever. And
you know, actually Jujitsu,
like if I have a sore back,

1225
01:25:46,150 --> 01:25:49,930
I love getting on the Mat. It just
loosens everything up. Feels so good.

1226
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,720
But that's only at a certain level.
Yeah.

1227
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,680
Cause when you're a white belts are a
bunch of belts or hope, purple belts, Ben,

1228
01:25:56,681 --> 01:26:00,190
that Bri and it's just a battle. You're,
you're getting off the mat. So we're,

1229
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:03,350
I don't get off the mat so often. She did
too. Seldom seldom do I get off the mat.

1230
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:07,820
Like man, I'm tired. I mean we train
today. I'm not, that was a no factor.

1231
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:10,640
You know what I mean? It's just,
Oh yeah, we trained the pill.

1232
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:15,600
If you get into the takedown elements
though, the that will even, yeah,

1233
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:18,980
it'll be hard on your back. But even
the takedown elements, you know,

1234
01:26:18,981 --> 01:26:21,080
if you're just going to do pure takedowns
yeah, but I'm going to take down,

1235
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:22,720
it's going to last how
long if your back sore,

1236
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:27,920
full guard and work something
else. Yeah. So that's it.

1237
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,160
In the bottom line is you work out,
you do some of these workouts,

1238
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:33,080
you'll get used to it,
you'll get in the zone.

1239
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:37,700
And then you won't be so sore all the
time. Yeah. That as that bucket of rest,

1240
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:40,880
I uh, I that's important.
That part where you're like,

1241
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:43,540
don't beat your doubt yourself.
Done. Cause the exercise,

1242
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:47,090
it technically freely split hairs here.

1243
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,240
The exercise doesn't make you stronger.

1244
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:55,880
The recovery from the exercise is
when you get stronger. So yeah,

1245
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:57,920
that was part of the whole
system that makes you strong.

1246
01:26:57,921 --> 01:27:01,040
But when you recover from that exercise,
that's when you're stronger.

1247
01:27:01,370 --> 01:27:03,890
I'll give you them. So, yeah.

1248
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,940
But the workout itself is what
induces the recovery, so. Sure.

1249
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:12,000
Yeah. So there you go. Um, you,

1250
01:27:12,050 --> 01:27:14,110
well I guess so it's all kinds
of different philosophies, right?

1251
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:17,440
Different approaches. It's like
you, you prefer the active rest, um,

1252
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:21,200
and not going hard everyday.
Some people they prefer go hard every day,

1253
01:27:21,201 --> 01:27:25,940
but then they'll have a straight up to
three days off. It's completely, you know,

1254
01:27:26,060 --> 01:27:30,470
um, but yeah, the, you know, recovery from
the exercise. That's, that's the tickets.

1255
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,810
And when I say go hard, I mean like
the muscular, you know, destroy,

1256
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:40,070
like if you can do squats until you can't
walk, you can't do that all the time.

1257
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:44,120
Yeah. You don't need to write,
you need to initiate the growth.

1258
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:49,510
You don't need to destroy them. Yeah.
And, and you can do, you, you know,

1259
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,040
you can put with them with
the metabolic conditioning,

1260
01:27:52,041 --> 01:27:54,230
you can really can destroy
herself a lot more often.

1261
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,550
And if you're doing it right,

1262
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:59,240
you shouldn't really be getting muscularly
sore from your metabolic condition.

1263
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:02,890
Yeah. If you're doing it right.
Right. But then again, he's a,

1264
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:06,840
isn't that really a spectrum as well? It
is a spectrum. It can be like a heavier,

1265
01:28:07,490 --> 01:28:10,070
quicker. That's the, that's
the beauty of working on,

1266
01:28:10,071 --> 01:28:11,710
that's why you should never
get bored with working out.

1267
01:28:11,711 --> 01:28:12,544
Cause you can change though.

1268
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:13,743
Okay,

1269
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:20,860
next one. Next question.
Jacko did you ever use,

1270
01:28:20,861 --> 01:28:25,270
do you do to in combat,
would it a striking art be
better for combat situations?

1271
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,210
Okay. So, yes. And, uh,

1272
01:28:30,510 --> 01:28:33,990
definitely this is one of the
things where I was actually,

1273
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:38,010
I read things about this and people say,
well no,

1274
01:28:38,011 --> 01:28:41,940
I mean why would a seal ever have to
use, you know, hand to hand combat?

1275
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:47,150
They have a rifle, they have a pistol,
they've got buddies with them. So you,

1276
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:50,370
if you've, if you have to
use your hand to hand combat,

1277
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:51,240
you've done something wrong.

1278
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:56,370
And that's actually completely wrong
because you know, it's very simple.

1279
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:59,760
You go into a room where there's people
in there and none of them were armed and

1280
01:28:59,761 --> 01:29:02,220
you have to get control of them.
You just start shooting people.

1281
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:03,880
You're going to have to get control them.
Right.

1282
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:08,250
So how do you get control
of them? Well, again,

1283
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:12,810
how does striking give you control of
someone? The answer is it does not.

1284
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:18,060
Unless you have a miracle touch that
you can just knock people out with one

1285
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:20,610
touch and then you can handcuff them.
People don't,

1286
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:25,170
boxers don't knock each other
out consistently. You know,

1287
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:27,960
it's,
it's very difficult to knock someone out.

1288
01:29:28,650 --> 01:29:32,310
And so this idea that, you
know, striking is better.

1289
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:37,430
You absolutely have to know how to strike,
but striking is a very,

1290
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:41,520
a very inconsistent way to
get control of somebody. Very,

1291
01:29:41,521 --> 01:29:43,710
very inconsistent way
of controlling people.

1292
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:48,830
And actually the sad thing is is that
it's striking is the most traumatic to

1293
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:54,660
the, to the person that you're
applying it to. And you know,

1294
01:29:54,661 --> 01:29:58,140
we used to do something or we were taught
something called the muzzle strike,

1295
01:29:58,170 --> 01:29:58,441
right?

1296
01:29:58,441 --> 01:30:02,730
Where you'd basically hit the person with
the muzzle of your gun and the people

1297
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:07,020
that were teaching it would
be like thinking that that
just stopped people like

1298
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:10,240
Yo, you give them one good muscle strike
because it does, it seems like, you know,

1299
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:15,140
a muzzle is a very strong, I mean a very
small point of impact and you think all,

1300
01:30:15,141 --> 01:30:17,730
if I put all my force behind
this small point of impact, man,

1301
01:30:17,731 --> 01:30:20,760
it's really going to hurt
somebody and take them down.

1302
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:26,630
And I saw hundreds of muzzle strikes
and they're really brutal and they,

1303
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:29,770
what they do is they cut you,

1304
01:30:29,790 --> 01:30:34,470
they cut you open very badly as a
lot of really bad cuts with rifle,

1305
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:38,640
a rifle and a,
but they sell them.

1306
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,950
Did they actually knock the person out?

1307
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:45,090
So what do you do then you muzzle strike
them again and then what do you do

1308
01:30:45,091 --> 01:30:46,980
after that? You muzzle strike
him again and when you do it,

1309
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:50,400
so you end up just to beat in a
meeting them Dang. But it's, but it's,

1310
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:53,990
but it's a harsh beating because
you, you using, uh, uh, you know,

1311
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,700
a pretty sharp muzzle of a weapon which
is cutting them open. So it's, it's,

1312
01:30:58,740 --> 01:30:59,910
it's not the best.

1313
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:03,540
Whereas if someone can get control of
somebody in the grappling type scenario,

1314
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:07,500
get control of them, you know, clinch
with them, take them down quickly.

1315
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:12,530
You can get control and very quick quickly
and they feel it and they resist less

1316
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:18,021
because they kind of feel owned and
they also don't feel like you're hurting

1317
01:31:19,231 --> 01:31:21,510
them. Whereas when you're
striking them in the face, man,

1318
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:24,600
what's your natural answer? Reaction?
If I strike you in the face,

1319
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:26,850
you can put your hands up.
Well if you put your hands up,

1320
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:29,070
maybe you're trying to attack me now I
got to hit you even harder. So it's uh,

1321
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:33,000
it's kind of a kind of a bad deal.
So yeah.

1322
01:31:33,001 --> 01:31:35,400
And then once you get a person on the
ground, obviously the more you know,

1323
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:39,940
the better you're going to
do. And that's why, you know,

1324
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:41,340
it's good.
It's good to have that.

1325
01:31:41,341 --> 01:31:44,580
Well roundedness but you
definitely want to use, you know,

1326
01:31:44,581 --> 01:31:45,900
you definitely want to
have a good ground game.

1327
01:31:45,901 --> 01:31:50,580
You want to have good striking
too, of course. And, but
the Jujitsu and the ground,

1328
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:53,460
the ground game is very important
because you've got to control people.

1329
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,680
And in a combat situation,

1330
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:59,110
everybody you come up against is not
a combatant and they still need to get

1331
01:31:59,111 --> 01:31:59,531
controlled.

1332
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:02,740
And some people you can just motion
to them to get down and that's great.

1333
01:32:02,741 --> 01:32:05,050
And then you can tell him to
lay down and that's great.

1334
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:08,410
And you can have your interpreter tell
them to put their hands behind their back

1335
01:32:08,411 --> 01:32:11,080
and then that's great. Or
you can say that, you know,
you can learn a few phrases,

1336
01:32:11,081 --> 01:32:14,110
which we always did. We always knew a
few phrases to tell them to, you know,

1337
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:15,670
get down,
show me your hands or whatever.

1338
01:32:16,240 --> 01:32:21,240
But then you get the person that maybe
they don't respond to what you're saying

1339
01:32:21,251 --> 01:32:23,890
and why aren't they responding? And
this is something I see, you know,

1340
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:25,660
in some of these police videos

1341
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:32,710
when I yell at you, you know,
get down, get down. Well,

1342
01:32:32,711 --> 01:32:35,290
you might be scared,
you might not know what I'm talking about.

1343
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:37,540
You might have headphones on,
you might be deaf,

1344
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:40,960
you might just be frozen with fear.
You might be a bad guy,

1345
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:43,330
you might be getting ready to
run all those different things.

1346
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,980
But if you're not doing what I tell you
to do, I got to get you to the ground.

1347
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:53,230
So how am I going to do that? And again,
I can walk up and take a swing at you,

1348
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:57,370
but you know, I've been punched
in the face many, many times.

1349
01:32:58,060 --> 01:33:01,000
Haven't been knocked out but twice.

1350
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:06,940
So all the times I've been punched
in the face, you know, many,

1351
01:33:06,941 --> 01:33:08,530
many times, I don't
know how many, but many,

1352
01:33:08,531 --> 01:33:11,620
many times it's hard to knock someone out.

1353
01:33:11,621 --> 01:33:13,830
So if you think cause you
walk over and strike someone,

1354
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,320
they're going to knock them out
and then you're gonna have control.

1355
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:19,780
But it's just not true. It's
just a fallacy. So you're
going to have to know some.

1356
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,600
And that the thing, this all goes
back to this, you know this case,

1357
01:33:22,601 --> 01:33:25,990
and I forget what the case was,
but somebody got choked years ago,

1358
01:33:25,991 --> 01:33:30,220
like in the 70s by a police officer
and I think they died or whatever,

1359
01:33:30,221 --> 01:33:35,140
but they banned choking. They banned
choking from most police forces.

1360
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:37,180
So that's why these guys,
what do they do?

1361
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,970
They pull out their Bhutan's and
start beating people. That was a big,

1362
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:41,920
big thing with Rodney King.
You know,

1363
01:33:41,921 --> 01:33:46,030
why didn't someone just go and put this
guy to sleep and he'd have no marks on

1364
01:33:46,031 --> 01:33:49,780
his body? You know, he'd be okay. You
could bring him back to the jail cell.

1365
01:33:49,781 --> 01:33:52,750
He's not going to have contusions.
He's not going to have the crappy down.

1366
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:54,640
We have no permanent damage whatsoever.

1367
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,180
But it wasn't allowed because of the,

1368
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:02,380
because of the political situation
that had happened years before,

1369
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:05,290
you weren't allowed to teach someone how
to choke someone and put them to sleep.

1370
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:09,460
Completely incapacitate them. Yeah. I
mean, the choke hold is a beautiful,

1371
01:34:09,610 --> 01:34:13,080
powerful thing. And when you
have, when you have, I mean,

1372
01:34:13,081 --> 01:34:16,360
you saw the Rodney king
tape, I mean there's, I don't
know how many cops or where,

1373
01:34:16,361 --> 01:34:18,940
but there's multiple cops beating him.

1374
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:21,220
That's a classic example
of what I'm saying.

1375
01:34:21,221 --> 01:34:23,080
Just because you strike someone doesn't,

1376
01:34:23,081 --> 01:34:26,050
even with a Billy club doesn't
mean they're going to stop.

1377
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:31,160
Whereas when you put a choke
hold on somebody, they are
going to sleep, you know,

1378
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:36,570
they are going to sleep 100% and when you
have three cops going against one guy,

1379
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:41,620
someone's going to get a
choke hold on. You know, and,

1380
01:34:41,650 --> 01:34:45,130
and despite what they did to Rodney
King beating him, he wasn't stopping.

1381
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,520
And so yeah, it's one of those things
I really hope that the, uh, the,

1382
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:53,470
the law enforcement gets the
ability to use, to, to train better,

1383
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:58,500
to use choke holds to use other forms
of grappling because it is absolutely

1384
01:34:58,521 --> 01:35:02,450
superior from a law enforcement
perspective. And from a,

1385
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:05,960
and from even from, like I said,
from a military perspective,

1386
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:09,470
when you go into a room and
there's noncombatants in
there that you have to get

1387
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:12,200
control over,
you don't want to start beating people.

1388
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:17,420
You want to use the minimum
required force. And yet when
people aren't compliant,

1389
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:22,060
you have to be able to do
something. Yeah. So yeah, the,

1390
01:35:22,061 --> 01:35:27,061
the minimum required force
that essentially makes
striking obsolete if you're

1391
01:35:29,331 --> 01:35:32,270
trying to approach it that way, or
if that's the regulation, you know,

1392
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:37,430
what if it's not in the regulation,
if you're, if you're a human yeah.

1393
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:42,170
And you've got a woman that is scared
or doesn't speak your language or as

1394
01:35:42,171 --> 01:35:47,060
petrified or whatever the case may be,
your answer is to Stryker in the face.

1395
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:48,710
Right. And what does, by the way,

1396
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:51,840
what does her husband do when
you strike her in the face? Yeah.

1397
01:35:52,100 --> 01:35:53,270
As opposed to if you come over,

1398
01:35:53,271 --> 01:35:56,510
you put your hands on or you gently push
her to ground, you feel some resistance.

1399
01:35:56,511 --> 01:36:00,350
Maybe you have to do some sort of
manipulation of a joint to get to control.

1400
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:05,000
But that is so much more mild than
a muzzle strike to the face. Yeah.

1401
01:36:05,001 --> 01:36:09,710
And if you know what to do, if you know
what you did to the no brainer. Yeah.

1402
01:36:09,711 --> 01:36:14,300
And it's, it's not hard to do to people.
And even in you'll see sometimes um,

1403
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:15,930
when when someone's trying to get,
you know,

1404
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:19,910
gain control and they'll put their arm
behind their back like chicken wings

1405
01:36:19,911 --> 01:36:23,090
situation, they'll do it
all hard. Like real hard.

1406
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:25,610
Cause they kinda got to
add that element of pain.

1407
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:28,960
So the guy will kind of quote
unquote know bell most Jujitsu stuff,

1408
01:36:29,010 --> 01:36:32,360
you don't have to put that pain. It's just
that controlling. Like you just can't.

1409
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:34,130
That's why a lot of people
were talking about this today.

1410
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,180
How a lot of people after they get their
first time in Jujitsu or something or

1411
01:36:38,181 --> 01:36:42,080
early on and you did so guy will tap
them out and they'll have this thing in

1412
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:45,490
their mind like oh I just have to
go harder. You know I can just,

1413
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:48,680
I can gain some kind of control.
I just got to go harder. But it,

1414
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,690
because it's not a hard thing.

1415
01:36:50,691 --> 01:36:55,310
It's not like aggressive feeling
to get controlled like that.

1416
01:36:55,340 --> 01:37:00,340
You're just simply controlled and you
know this ties so much to life cause we

1417
01:37:02,091 --> 01:37:02,690
talk about,
I'd be,

1418
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:05,990
you hear me talk about this all time
and I was going back and forth with

1419
01:37:05,991 --> 01:37:07,220
somebody on Twitter the other day about,

1420
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:10,820
I'm like you got to use the indirect
approach with people, right?

1421
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,720
So picture this next time you're dealing
with a person that's combative and I

1422
01:37:14,721 --> 01:37:18,440
mean now I'm talking about
verbally combative or, or their,

1423
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:23,240
their ideas are combative against your
combatives is the first thing you want to

1424
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:26,750
do. Go up and punch him in the face
or muzzle strike them. Right. Cause,

1425
01:37:26,751 --> 01:37:28,010
what is the reaction to be?

1426
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:31,130
What the reaction is going to be
able to immediately be defensive.

1427
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,770
You don't want to put
people in that predicament.

1428
01:37:33,860 --> 01:37:37,160
You want to use the Jujitsu on them.
You want to,

1429
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,520
you want to get them feeling comfortable
when you're going to sleep. You,

1430
01:37:40,940 --> 01:37:43,730
when somebody puts a choke hold
on you, you're done. I mean,

1431
01:37:43,731 --> 01:37:47,240
you're just going to sleep.
You sneak in behind. So,

1432
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:51,860
so don't get this idea that when you're
dealing with people in a confrontation,

1433
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,130
not only physically,
but a verbal or a mental confrontation.

1434
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:59,070
I'm not even talking about a confrontation
in, you know, yelling in the street.

1435
01:37:59,071 --> 01:38:01,170
I'm talking about in the office.

1436
01:38:02,010 --> 01:38:03,840
I'm talking about dealing
with one of your subordinates.

1437
01:38:03,841 --> 01:38:07,650
I'm talking about dealing with your
boss or whoever. Think about using,

1438
01:38:07,651 --> 01:38:10,500
instead of thinking about,
hey, I'm going to, you know,

1439
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,460
smash this person in the face and that's
going to bring me the win. No, it's not.

1440
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:19,440
Generally, it is not generally what
brings you the win is, okay, hey,

1441
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:24,000
where's what's going on? Let's sneak in
there. Let's get inside their head. Let's,

1442
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:26,640
let's not aggravate the situation.

1443
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:32,830
Let's bring the situation towards a
better area where we can use our control.

1444
01:38:36,820 --> 01:38:39,430
Yeah. You won't get the win,
you'll get a fight. Oh yeah.

1445
01:38:39,431 --> 01:38:41,950
You definitely get a fight even though
that's not the goal. Yeah. You'd be,

1446
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:46,650
if they are combative and your answer
is to be more combative, you know,

1447
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:50,440
and I hear answer, you know their answers
gonna be. Yeah. Even more so. Yeah.

1448
01:38:50,580 --> 01:38:53,080
Then you got yourself
a fight hener in them.

1449
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:56,920
Gracie's they're doing good stuff with
law enforcement using you get to an

1450
01:38:56,921 --> 01:39:00,850
actual police tactics. So it
comes from, you know, in context,

1451
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:02,290
if you're,

1452
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:07,290
if you're a police officer out there or
you're in law enforcement in the hangar,

1453
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:08,620
that's great.
Guess what?

1454
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:11,830
There's a Jujitsu studio everywhere
in the country right now.

1455
01:39:11,860 --> 01:39:15,700
Go train some Jujitsu. Just go
start training. No big deal.

1456
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:18,400
Just go start training.
Yeah,

1457
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:23,530
and I have, I have a friend, um, Craig,
he's from, from, from Hawaii. He,

1458
01:39:23,531 --> 01:39:27,280
um, good copy. You see them on Facebook.

1459
01:39:27,281 --> 01:39:29,650
I'll like repost stuff.
Sometimes he'll like,

1460
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:31,630
he'll come down to the skate park whether,
you know,

1461
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:35,220
he got called or whatever
and he'll be ready. Yeah.

1462
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:38,990
Do some skating or he'll race
somewhere or whatever. He's, but he's,

1463
01:39:38,991 --> 01:39:42,640
he's that you did too. I think he's a
purple or brown belt. Has the confidence.

1464
01:39:42,670 --> 01:39:47,350
Yeah man. That's what it is. He has the
confidence. Yeah. That's awesome. Yup.

1465
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:52,180
Can Be be a good guy, you
know. Good guy with the power.

1466
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:57,040
Next question Jocko.

1467
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,960
How did you prepare for buds specifically
and where were you physically

1468
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:04,520
wise within your class?

1469
01:40:05,810 --> 01:40:08,720
It must be a physical night around here.

1470
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:12,290
Physical activity nights. Well that's
what the questions are tonight,

1471
01:40:12,291 --> 01:40:17,240
it seems like. So how did I prepare for
buds? Well, again, you've got to go back.

1472
01:40:17,241 --> 01:40:19,040
This is now 1989,

1473
01:40:20,270 --> 01:40:23,780
1990 and added.

1474
01:40:23,781 --> 01:40:26,690
I prepare for buds back then.
Well, we didn't know anything.

1475
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,600
I didn't know anything. There was
no media, there was no internet,

1476
01:40:29,601 --> 01:40:34,550
there was nothing. There wasn't
even any books. So what did,

1477
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:37,850
what did I do? And it wasn't even a week,
it was just an eye because I was alone.

1478
01:40:38,180 --> 01:40:41,060
I didn't know any seals. I didn't
know when he was at an, um, in,

1479
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:44,150
in any kind of special operations at all.

1480
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:49,640
So you're just young and stupid and just,
okay. So I just looked at it and said,

1481
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:55,480
it appears that seal training is a bunch
of running and swimming and pushing

1482
01:40:55,660 --> 01:41:00,660
pushups and pull ups and rope climbs and
dips looks to me like in the pictures

1483
01:41:03,911 --> 01:41:05,050
that the recruiter showed me,

1484
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:09,130
they were wearing boots and and fatigues.

1485
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:12,280
So what did I do?
Went to the army navy store,

1486
01:41:12,340 --> 01:41:15,100
bought a couple pair of fatigue pants,

1487
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:20,130
bought a couple pairs of jungle boots
that looked like what I saw in the

1488
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:25,600
recruiting office and I
just ran with boots on.

1489
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:28,510
I swam, I did pull ups, pushups and dips.

1490
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:31,330
That's what I did to get ready for it.

1491
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:35,440
There was no periodization
and there wasn't any plan.

1492
01:41:35,441 --> 01:41:37,870
There was no why wasn't
doing the Wad that you know,

1493
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:39,370
there was no workout of the day.

1494
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:43,980
I just ran and swam and did involves
pushups and dips and I did them a lot and,

1495
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:47,110
and,
and actually I did them a lot,

1496
01:41:47,111 --> 01:41:51,880
but I didn't even know what I was capable
of or what even a person was capable

1497
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:54,700
of because back then you could look
up on the Internet and say like,

1498
01:41:54,701 --> 01:41:59,470
what's good as far as pullups
go? Yeah. I had no idea.

1499
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:04,810
You know, so I think I could
do 18 that solid. No, it's not.

1500
01:42:04,811 --> 01:42:09,760
Not when you're going through
seal training, but you
know, you just had no idea.

1501
01:42:09,761 --> 01:42:13,150
I just said okay, that's, and I didn't
know how to do get to be able to do more.

1502
01:42:13,180 --> 01:42:17,050
I mean I just did a bunch
and doesn't that work though?

1503
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:20,400
I mean it didn't that work. Yeah, it did.
Yeah. I mean you do a bunch of pull ups.

1504
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:22,610
Yeah. You do a bunch of pull ups
and you get better at pull ups.

1505
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:24,830
You do a bunch of dips, you get better
at dips, you do a bunch of pushups,

1506
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,210
you get better at pushups.
And Luckily I ran with boots on.

1507
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:30,400
That's one thing that got
lot of guys had trouble with.

1508
01:42:30,401 --> 01:42:33,460
I think nowadays they use these,
they're almost like tennis shoes.

1509
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:38,110
The boots that they run with
are like really light in
buds. They're really light,

1510
01:42:38,111 --> 01:42:42,130
athletic kind of boots.
But back in the day they were straight,

1511
01:42:42,131 --> 01:42:46,000
just hardcore jungle boots and, and a
lot of guys at Brahms, Shin splints,

1512
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,740
stress fractures and all that.

1513
01:42:47,741 --> 01:42:50,230
And I was good to go because I was
used to running in boots cause I was a

1514
01:42:50,231 --> 01:42:54,550
knucklehead. And then the other part of
the question physically, where was I?

1515
01:42:54,570 --> 01:42:57,280
My class, I was about in the middle
of the pack. That's where I was.

1516
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:02,350
I was not the fastest, I was not the
fastest runner, not the fastest swimmer.

1517
01:43:02,351 --> 01:43:04,180
I wasn't the fastest
at the obstacle course.

1518
01:43:05,020 --> 01:43:10,020
I actually failed a run when I decided
in my ultimate brilliance that I would

1519
01:43:13,631 --> 01:43:18,580
just pace myself for this run and uh,
failed.

1520
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:22,150
The run missed at the time it gets the,

1521
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:24,700
the run was supposed to be four miles,

1522
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:27,940
but back in those days there was
no supervision on the instructors,

1523
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,710
like limited supervision I should say.
And so the runs would be 4.3 miles,

1524
01:43:32,740 --> 01:43:37,630
4.6 miles to 4.2 miles, 3.8 miles. You
just didn't really know and it was fine.

1525
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:39,810
I mean that's the way it should be.
And,

1526
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:41,500
and actually you weren't
allowed to wear a watch,

1527
01:43:41,501 --> 01:43:43,870
so you had no idea what you're
doing. So I just said, oh,

1528
01:43:43,871 --> 01:43:48,640
I'm going to pace myself and keep
a good steady pace and I failed.

1529
01:43:48,970 --> 01:43:53,300
And so from then on there's only one way
I ran it was, it was as hard as I could,

1530
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,340
as literally as hard as it,
when they blew the whistle to go.

1531
01:43:55,341 --> 01:43:57,640
I just ran as hard as I could
until the thing was over weight.

1532
01:43:57,641 --> 01:43:58,640
So why do you feel though?

1533
01:43:58,641 --> 01:44:02,900
Like did you just pace yourself too
slowly or dd pays itself and then shoot,

1534
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:06,410
you started gassing anyway. No, I
paced myself and it wasn't fast enough.

1535
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:10,560
That's it. I faced myself and
it wasn't fast enough. I just,

1536
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:15,140
and I was there, I was right
behind the cutoff point. You know,

1537
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:18,890
they're like boom. And the guy ahead of
me, he gets through and he, you know,

1538
01:44:18,891 --> 01:44:22,760
one guy ahead of me, he gets turned
away like, no, you failed man.

1539
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:27,140
So I never paced myself again.
All I could do to sprint. That's,

1540
01:44:27,200 --> 01:44:28,790
that's the way a lot of the
evolutions where for me,

1541
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,450
I just had to just go as
hard as I could because I,

1542
01:44:31,451 --> 01:44:33,680
I wasn't the best at any of it.
And

1543
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:38,690
the only thing I was maybe a
little bit better at was anything,

1544
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:41,120
I've talked about this before, we have
anything that I had to carry weight,

1545
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:44,050
like a rucksack. I was a little
bit better at the normal. No,

1546
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:48,560
definitely not stellar,
but um, but you know,

1547
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:49,394
I had a,

1548
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:54,400
I had an NCL NCAA water polo champion
in my buds class and I had a Olympic

1549
01:44:57,591 --> 01:45:00,050
alternate gymnast in my Buds Class.

1550
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:04,640
And both those guys were stud
athletes. I mean, they're both,

1551
01:45:05,210 --> 01:45:07,460
I mean those are some of the top,
top athletes in the world. I mean,

1552
01:45:07,461 --> 01:45:12,461
if you win the NCAA championships of
water polo and you're an Olympic alternate

1553
01:45:12,980 --> 01:45:16,310
gymnast, you know, you're
just a of specimen.

1554
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:21,320
And both of those guys
quit. Yeah. And there I was,

1555
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:25,400
Joe average. But uh, yeah,

1556
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:29,810
the bottom line is though, you get
to the, you get to the seal teams,

1557
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:33,110
no one cares about buds.
No one cares about that stuff.

1558
01:45:33,140 --> 01:45:35,300
It's a baseline of training and that's it.

1559
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,690
That's why I don't talk about it
that often. It's like who cares?

1560
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,870
He and bud was there like
people who would, um,

1561
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:46,820
like let's say I was really
good at running miles. Was
there people who would be,

1562
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:50,020
you could tell they were showing
off to be like first, you know, oh,

1563
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:52,370
everyone's trying to win. They're
gonna start to go first. And if you,

1564
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:55,580
if you ran track more cross country,

1565
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:59,960
you are going to be fine in buds for
running unless you got stress fractures.

1566
01:46:00,140 --> 01:46:03,530
If you swam or you played
water polo or whatever,

1567
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:06,050
you are going to be fine in the running.

1568
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:10,340
So if you did some kind of high school
sport that was related to those two,

1569
01:46:10,341 --> 01:46:13,730
you are going to be pretty good to
go. Yeah. But where they'd like, oh,

1570
01:46:13,731 --> 01:46:15,860
so when you say they were trying to
win, they're trying to be first. Yeah,

1571
01:46:15,861 --> 01:46:20,630
of course. Everyone's trying to win. Yeah.
And this is, I mean, right, aren't you?

1572
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:23,890
I am. It seems like I, yeah,

1573
01:46:26,270 --> 01:46:30,880
I tried. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, you're in
that situation, right? You're Beth win.

1574
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:35,240
Be The guy, the man. Next question.

1575
01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:36,883
Let's do it.

1576
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:41,630
One of the most powerful tools I've
used as a military leader is rehearsals.

1577
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:46,940
I would love to hear your thoughts
on rehearsals. So rehearsals,

1578
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:50,370
and this is actually shocking
that I've never about rehearsals.

1579
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,560
Rehearsals like what? Like, oh, we're
going to do it. You're doing a commission,

1580
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:58,530
like a dresser and a practice for you.
And they're totally critical.

1581
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:03,690
And one of the biggest parts of
preparing for an operation correctly,

1582
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:08,100
you know, we used to have this,
they used to say one third planning,

1583
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:11,310
one third gear prep,
and one third rehearsals.

1584
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:14,550
That's how you're supposed to
spend your time. And it's, it's a,

1585
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:19,140
it's a rule that gets violated very
often because people spend too much time

1586
01:47:19,141 --> 01:47:21,510
planning and not enough time rehearsing.

1587
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:24,870
So we would always,

1588
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:28,260
I would always try and push the rehearsals
as much as possible and I would,

1589
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,050
when I was, uh, when I
was in charge of troops,

1590
01:47:31,051 --> 01:47:35,670
I would try and push rehearsals and then
when I was training troops I would try

1591
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:37,530
and get them to rehearse.
But it's hard. Like I said,

1592
01:47:37,531 --> 01:47:39,570
people get drawn into the planning piece.

1593
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:44,580
But a plan without a rehearsal
is not a plan really. So,

1594
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:50,190
you know, definitely use the
rehearsals, rehearse as much as you can,

1595
01:47:50,191 --> 01:47:53,160
be hard on yourself during rehearsals,
rehearse contingencies.

1596
01:47:53,161 --> 01:47:57,750
That's something we used to do that I
was pretty intent on was rehearsing the

1597
01:47:57,751 --> 01:47:59,490
contingency.
So what could go wrong here?

1598
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,010
What could go different
at the target area?

1599
01:48:02,011 --> 01:48:05,070
What's a different alternate route that
we might have to hit the target from?

1600
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:07,770
And just just go through a
couple of those contingencies.

1601
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:12,570
And actually when you do that,
make sure you, if you are hearse,

1602
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:14,970
a couple continuing, if you
rehearse your, your main plan,

1603
01:48:15,150 --> 01:48:16,890
let's say you walk through it three times,

1604
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:20,370
then you rehearse two
or three contingencies,

1605
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:23,520
go back and do the main
plan two more times.

1606
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,680
Just so that's what they leave with
the, you want that in their heads. They,

1607
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:29,730
you want that in their heads because
otherwise it'll be a little bit of

1608
01:48:29,731 --> 01:48:34,710
confusion. But you definitely want to
rehearse some contingencies as well.

1609
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:40,070
And we also would rehearse the things
that were the things that happened all the

1610
01:48:40,441 --> 01:48:44,970
time. So even, you know, a good
example was like are breached team,

1611
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:48,360
which is the team that kind of goes in
to blow up a door so you can get in the

1612
01:48:48,361 --> 01:48:50,040
building and they have
their little procedures.

1613
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:54,510
We'd heard that Bruce preaching would
rehearse over and over and over again so

1614
01:48:54,511 --> 01:48:56,820
that they're really just smooth and good
and they don't have to talk and they

1615
01:48:56,821 --> 01:48:59,790
can do things very
quickly. And, and you know,

1616
01:48:59,820 --> 01:49:02,100
the way we got into
vehicles now to vehicles,

1617
01:49:02,101 --> 01:49:05,400
we always rehearsed that even
though we'd rehearsed it by,

1618
01:49:05,401 --> 01:49:07,680
I mean by the end of deployment,

1619
01:49:07,681 --> 01:49:10,410
you've rehearsed that hundreds of
times and you still go there, hey,

1620
01:49:10,411 --> 01:49:11,800
dismount the vehicles and,

1621
01:49:11,970 --> 01:49:16,140
and get information because
it's just another time,

1622
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:20,160
more muscle memory for everybody.
And you could do it with all the,

1623
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:22,950
all the stuff that you do in the field,
you know,

1624
01:49:22,951 --> 01:49:26,520
whether you're calling it a
helicopter for a casualty evacuation,

1625
01:49:26,521 --> 01:49:29,250
how you're going to set up that landing
zone. You Rehearse that a few times,

1626
01:49:29,251 --> 01:49:32,100
just do it, you know, a couple of
times before you roll out an operation.

1627
01:49:32,101 --> 01:49:34,080
That way when it happens,
everybody knows what to do.

1628
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:39,530
And this obviously translates
directly to everything else.

1629
01:49:40,621 --> 01:49:42,870
I mean, especially in business, I mean we,

1630
01:49:42,900 --> 01:49:45,540
we work with construction
companies and you know,

1631
01:49:45,541 --> 01:49:49,480
I talk a lot of times talk about with
construction companies because they lose

1632
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:51,850
lives,
they lose money,

1633
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:54,730
they lose jobs because they have,

1634
01:49:54,850 --> 01:49:58,630
if they have safety incidences and
how do they handle when they happen,

1635
01:49:58,631 --> 01:50:00,430
what are you do? So, you know,

1636
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:02,980
rehearsing the emergency procedures
and when something happens,

1637
01:50:02,981 --> 01:50:07,120
rehearsing the setup before you
start a certain type of, you know,

1638
01:50:07,121 --> 01:50:11,750
construction operation, that's good.
Even with the sales world, like when I,

1639
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:15,340
when I, you know, a lot of
teams that every business has,

1640
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:18,580
well just about every business has
some sort of sales force in it, right?

1641
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:22,800
Would that are trying to sell things and
how do you rehearse for them? Well you,

1642
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:24,520
you do some role playing where you know,

1643
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:27,730
somebody gets on and plays the
super hard client, you know,

1644
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:31,260
somebody gets on and complaints,
how do you eat late?

1645
01:50:31,261 --> 01:50:33,970
Let's rehearse how you're going to
talk through when somebody calls up to

1646
01:50:33,971 --> 01:50:36,460
complaint and in two or three iterations,

1647
01:50:36,520 --> 01:50:40,270
people will improve on how they handle
complaints and how they handle a super

1648
01:50:40,271 --> 01:50:43,090
hard client.
How they overcome some objections.

1649
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,330
But you do that through rehearsal and
it makes you just makes you better.

1650
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:48,760
You know, it's um, you know that the,

1651
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:53,860
I mean another rehearsal would be like a,
we work with the gas oil industry,

1652
01:50:54,100 --> 01:50:57,190
so how are they going to
handle when there's a leak,

1653
01:50:57,220 --> 01:51:01,060
how are they going to handle when there's
some kind of a ecological problem or a

1654
01:51:01,061 --> 01:51:05,710
fire or what are you gonna
do you know? Oh, you're going
to dial this number. Okay,

1655
01:51:05,711 --> 01:51:07,300
let's check that,
that number of my works.

1656
01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:10,030
How long has that number been in this
little pamphlet that's been sitting by the

1657
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:14,560
phone? You know, when's the last time
that got checked out? Uh, where's,

1658
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:18,820
where is the communications notes?
What if they get hit?

1659
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:22,570
What's the alternative plan? So
just, yeah, rehearsals are awesome.

1660
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:25,420
The finance world, we see
it as well. What kind of,

1661
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:30,100
what if there's a drastic downturn
in the market or a drastic upturn?

1662
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:33,940
Do you have a rehearsed plan
of what you're going to do,

1663
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,520
who you're going to contact
if you have decisions to make?

1664
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:40,280
Triggers have been hit. Just
rehearse that stuff. Yeah,

1665
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:45,250
just rehearse it so everybody
knows and it's very, very helpful.

1666
01:51:45,251 --> 01:51:47,290
I know when I was in charge of training,
I had a very,

1667
01:51:47,291 --> 01:51:52,291
a very squared away and fired up a
corpsman who is our medical support.

1668
01:51:53,590 --> 01:51:57,070
And he just, you know, I talked about
rehearsals one time or whatever,

1669
01:51:57,071 --> 01:51:57,730
and he came to me and said,

1670
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:01,000
we're going to rehearse all
of our casualty evacuations
for all of our different

1671
01:52:01,001 --> 01:52:05,500
training sites. So, and he did. And he'd
come back and he'd find, you know, hey,

1672
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:07,030
guess what?
This is what I found on this one.

1673
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,300
The life flight that we were supposed
to call didn't exist anymore.

1674
01:52:10,810 --> 01:52:13,510
They went out of business or they
changed their number or whatever,

1675
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:17,790
or this Lz that we were planning on
using has a house on it now, you know.

1676
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:21,970
And so we found real stuff. And you know
what this particular guy, great guy,

1677
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:27,190
he in that time, he got all those
casualty evacuation plans squared away.

1678
01:52:27,191 --> 01:52:27,850
And in that,

1679
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:32,850
in that year we actually did two real
casualty evacuation from training sites

1680
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:36,700
for real critical injuries in
both of them went super smooth,

1681
01:52:36,701 --> 01:52:40,600
all because of his efforts
and they ran full rehearsals,

1682
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:44,880
full rehearsals. And so just,
just that kind of thing,

1683
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:49,700
those things save lives for sure.
Just doing those full rehearsals.

1684
01:52:49,701 --> 01:52:53,180
So yes, rehearse, rehearse and rehearse

1685
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:57,650
in anything that you're doing.
Cause it'll make you better. Yes.

1686
01:52:57,651 --> 01:53:02,651
But I would think that anytime you're in
a situation where it being on the spot

1687
01:53:02,941 --> 01:53:07,560
is a big factor, you know,
where, where you have to make
a decision quick, you know,

1688
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:11,930
you don't have a day or two days
to analyze and make a decision. Um,

1689
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:13,440
feel like that would,

1690
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:18,540
rehearsal would be a critical part of
preparing for something like that. Yeah.

1691
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,160
And you can do that with

1692
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:21,820
decision making.
Sure.

1693
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:26,110
You can set up all kinds of rehearsals
for decision me for decision making in

1694
01:53:26,111 --> 01:53:27,600
whatever industry you're in just,

1695
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,670
but what I like to do is make
those decisions critical,

1696
01:53:30,700 --> 01:53:34,270
make those challenging so that
you're putting somebody on the spot,

1697
01:53:34,271 --> 01:53:36,100
you're putting a leader in a spot.
And I'll tell you what,

1698
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:38,320
one thing that's very cool about this,

1699
01:53:38,321 --> 01:53:40,490
and this is something you could
carry over to everything you do it,

1700
01:53:40,491 --> 01:53:41,830
it goes to decentralize command,

1701
01:53:41,831 --> 01:53:46,831
it goes to instilling initiative and
people you run rehearsals where the only

1702
01:53:48,311 --> 01:53:53,250
solution is to go outside
the box of the plant.

1703
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,190
Oh,
during the rehearsal,

1704
01:53:54,191 --> 01:53:59,191
during the rehearsal or rehearsal where
the only solution is to disobey what the

1705
01:53:59,231 --> 01:54:00,064
order is.

1706
01:54:01,510 --> 01:54:04,120
And the reason I'm bringing this up
specifically as it cause you're talking

1707
01:54:04,121 --> 01:54:07,900
about rehearsing when there's
decisions that need to be made.

1708
01:54:07,901 --> 01:54:11,800
So this is going a little bit from
rehearsal almost into a training scenario,

1709
01:54:11,801 --> 01:54:14,770
right? So we're getting
away from rehearsal where
you're rehearsing a specific

1710
01:54:14,771 --> 01:54:19,771
operation into a training scenario where
what you're trying to do in training is

1711
01:54:20,171 --> 01:54:21,640
you're trying to get people to think.

1712
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:23,530
You're trying to get people
to think on their own.

1713
01:54:23,531 --> 01:54:26,470
And that is the most beautiful
thing that you want as a leader,

1714
01:54:26,471 --> 01:54:29,800
as you want all your people thinking and
you want them to be able to think with

1715
01:54:29,801 --> 01:54:34,180
a completely open mind at mine that's
been completely freed from constraints.

1716
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:37,240
And the way that you do that,
one of the ways that you do that,

1717
01:54:37,241 --> 01:54:41,230
one of the methodologies you can use
to do that is everybody's got their box

1718
01:54:41,231 --> 01:54:42,550
right that they're stuck in.

1719
01:54:42,970 --> 01:54:47,970
So you formulate a problem that the
only way that they're going to solve the

1720
01:54:49,331 --> 01:54:52,390
problem is to get outside of that
box. And you know, one of the,

1721
01:54:52,450 --> 01:54:55,930
one of the best ones is you put somebody
in a situation where you put parameters

1722
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:58,120
on them and you say, Hey, no matter what,

1723
01:54:58,121 --> 01:54:59,560
you're not allowed to go across this line.

1724
01:55:01,030 --> 01:55:03,130
And then you put them in a situation
would have to cross that line.

1725
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:05,680
And the only way they're going
to win us across that line.

1726
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,950
And then they come back and they said,
well you told me not to cross that line.

1727
01:55:09,250 --> 01:55:09,731
You know what?

1728
01:55:09,731 --> 01:55:12,370
I didn't tell you to get you all your
guys killed or I didn't tell you to,

1729
01:55:12,580 --> 01:55:16,510
to not make that investment
even in this critical situation.

1730
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:17,980
Or I didn't tell you not to do that.

1731
01:55:17,981 --> 01:55:21,340
If we had an ecological disaster
that was going on, right?

1732
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:26,440
So you need to train
people to use common sense.

1733
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:30,070
That's what you want to train me to do.
And it's very hard.

1734
01:55:30,071 --> 01:55:35,071
You'd be surprised at how at how
constrain people's brains get mine,

1735
01:55:36,941 --> 01:55:39,280
yours, everybody. We get stuck.

1736
01:55:39,550 --> 01:55:44,340
And so it's great to do drilling and
training where you are opening up the mind

1737
01:55:44,341 --> 01:55:48,690
and freeing the mind from any kind of
constraint where you can see things from

1738
01:55:48,930 --> 01:55:51,960
varied perspectives that
are different from your own.

1739
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:57,080
And you can see outlets and solutions
that you would never have seen if you trap

1740
01:55:57,451 --> 01:55:59,070
yourself inside your box.

1741
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,210
And those are the kinds of training
scenarios that are outstanding.

1742
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:07,680
And those are the kinds of training
scenarios that make people better leaders

1743
01:56:07,681 --> 01:56:09,690
and better decision makers.

1744
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:13,980
Because the key thing that they learn
how to do is they learn how to detach.

1745
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:16,290
Even at that moment,
we talk about it all the time.

1746
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:21,000
But if you can't detach
from that situation and you
can't detach far enough away

1747
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:24,060
from the picture to see that the only
way you're going to solve this problem is

1748
01:56:24,061 --> 01:56:27,180
by going across that line that
you were told not to go across.

1749
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:31,830
If you can't make that detachment,
you're never going to cross that line.

1750
01:56:31,950 --> 01:56:35,040
You're never going to open your mind.
You're never gonna see that solution.

1751
01:56:35,490 --> 01:56:37,620
And that is a horrible trap to be stuck in

1752
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:44,940
the movie boiler room where the, during
the training, they give them a, you know,

1753
01:56:44,941 --> 01:56:46,140
it's a sales thing,
right?

1754
01:56:46,380 --> 01:56:50,520
They even miss index all these index
cards with rebuttals. Right? Like,

1755
01:56:50,610 --> 01:56:55,180
oh my wife won't let me buy
this. You know? Oh, your
wife runs your family, right?

1756
01:56:55,181 --> 01:56:59,310
Yeah. Yup. You ever see that
movie boiler room? I have
seen it. I have seen it. Yeah.

1757
01:56:59,311 --> 01:57:01,360
There's some good,
good training in there.

1758
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:05,100
And how to overcome those objections and
people become better at. And the more,

1759
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:07,920
the more you give them to chew on,
the better they'll get at.

1760
01:57:07,930 --> 01:57:12,810
It's the same thing where you're
trying to give people the tools,

1761
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,581
but you know,

1762
01:57:14,581 --> 01:57:17,250
I want to go into that scenario and I
want to ask them a question when I'm

1763
01:57:17,251 --> 01:57:18,540
training them that they've never,

1764
01:57:18,541 --> 01:57:20,940
I want to give them an objection
that they've never heard before.

1765
01:57:21,210 --> 01:57:23,940
Let them think on their feet, let them
see, let them step back and say, Hey,

1766
01:57:23,941 --> 01:57:26,430
you know what? This one's
not in the cards. Where am I
going to go with it? Right.

1767
01:57:26,460 --> 01:57:30,180
Yeah. The card seems like that would fall
within rehearsal. Right, right, right.

1768
01:57:30,460 --> 01:57:32,090
[inaudible] expanded rehearsal.
Yeah,

1769
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:36,480
I bet you they get 95% of the,

1770
01:57:36,870 --> 01:57:40,440
of the common objections that you get.
You know, you talked to a car salesman,

1771
01:57:40,441 --> 01:57:42,850
they hear x amount of objections.
You talked to uh,

1772
01:57:43,130 --> 01:57:46,890
a phone salesman or an aunt
or net sales men or you know,

1773
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:51,120
whoever calls you up on the phone, they
hear the same, the solar people, right.

1774
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:54,450
The solar people call you all the time
or the power company calls you with this

1775
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:57,570
or the cable company, the other cable
company calls you with their offer.

1776
01:57:57,780 --> 01:58:00,090
They hear the same objections all
the time, you know what I mean?

1777
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:02,400
So they train for those for sure.

1778
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,020
Browse and me numbers of coming down to
Vons and they were like, hey, you know,

1779
01:58:07,110 --> 01:58:10,230
hey come here. I got
some tech this out. It's,

1780
01:58:10,231 --> 01:58:14,970
I'm the ones where you can
sponsor a child, one of
those kinds of things. Right.

1781
01:58:15,270 --> 01:58:18,750
So I was like, Hey, you
know, yeah, you know, we, we,

1782
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,960
we donate but we like to research and
look into and before I could really finish

1783
01:58:24,241 --> 01:58:26,030
the sentence,
I was going to say we,

1784
01:58:26,130 --> 01:58:29,220
I like to look into all the programs that
we donate to or things are considered

1785
01:58:29,221 --> 01:58:30,910
delineating too.
Before I could finish this,

1786
01:58:30,911 --> 01:58:33,000
that or right when I finished
the sentence, he was like,

1787
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:36,600
a lot of people are concerned about
where the money goes and all this stuff.

1788
01:58:36,601 --> 01:58:39,960
And he knew everything that was like,
oh, these guys are getting advanced city.

1789
01:58:40,330 --> 01:58:43,600
Yeah, man. Tough. He's prepared and
he rehearsed. Good for animas trained.

1790
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:49,070
Next question,
Jocko for the podcasts.

1791
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:53,080
What's your opinion on
calisthenics versus weights?

1792
01:58:55,750 --> 01:58:59,500
Again for me both,
I like them both.

1793
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:03,970
You know with calisthenics you
get that endurance strength,

1794
01:59:03,971 --> 01:59:06,700
you get some flexibility
and some mobility out of it.

1795
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,010
They're pretty natural movements,
right?

1796
01:59:09,011 --> 01:59:11,620
They're pretty natural movements or
things that you're doing with your human

1797
01:59:11,621 --> 01:59:13,780
body.
So they're going to be more natural.

1798
01:59:14,050 --> 01:59:17,530
Weights obviously make you stronger,

1799
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:19,900
more explosive.

1800
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:25,470
At a certain point they also
can be more injury inducing.

1801
01:59:26,020 --> 01:59:29,410
Sure.
And add another point.

1802
01:59:29,470 --> 01:59:32,200
They're also less injury inducing.

1803
01:59:32,500 --> 01:59:37,420
So there's a certain point where if you
have an injury in your shoulder and you

1804
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:41,860
normally would do handstand pushups,
which means you're lifting up 230 pounds.

1805
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:47,200
Well with weight training you could
lift up 40 pounds if you want to.

1806
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,370
Right? So, so there's,

1807
01:59:48,400 --> 01:59:53,400
it goes both ways where
sometimes calisthenics might
be the more injury inducing

1808
01:59:54,011 --> 01:59:57,400
thing and sometimes weight training
might be the more injury inducing things.

1809
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:03,100
That's why you got to balance the two of
them, you know? And for instance, when I,

1810
02:00:03,101 --> 02:00:08,101
if I like I hurt my ankle a couple of
months ago and I could not put any weight

1811
02:00:08,621 --> 02:00:12,130
on the scroll bar. So I was just
doing, you know, pistols and,

1812
02:00:12,520 --> 02:00:17,450
and you know, air squats,
jumps and box jumps, you know,

1813
02:00:17,451 --> 02:00:20,320
as using things that war didn't have
any way cause I could do all that.

1814
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:25,070
But the minute I put weight on my
back, Yo, anything above bodyweight,

1815
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:28,510
it started to hurt. And so I just
needed to let that thing he'll,

1816
02:00:28,511 --> 02:00:32,590
and I used the calisthenics to
get me there. And then the same,

1817
02:00:32,591 --> 02:00:34,660
exact opposite.
I had a,

1818
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:38,830
my shoulder was tweaked six months
ago and I was having a hard time doing

1819
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:42,280
handstand pushups cause it was just the
wrong angle. And so I was just using,

1820
02:00:42,730 --> 02:00:43,563
just using,

1821
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:46,930
I was doing press with a lighter weight
than my body weight in order to keep the

1822
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:49,090
blood moving in quarter,
in order to keep the,

1823
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:54,190
in order to keep the system moving. Cause
that's what I think you've got to do.

1824
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:58,180
So I think you gotta be, you gotta
find a balance of both, which means,

1825
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:01,390
which means I'm not great
at either one of them.

1826
02:01:01,391 --> 02:01:04,690
I'm not going to win in any
weightlifting competitions.

1827
02:01:04,691 --> 02:01:08,620
And I'm not going to win in a
gymnastics competition either. And

1828
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,010
there are some guys,
especially now,

1829
02:01:12,011 --> 02:01:16,480
I mean there's some guys that are
getting in sick shape. Um, you know,

1830
02:01:16,481 --> 02:01:18,760
you watch the guys in the
crossfit games right now,

1831
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:24,400
they're savages and they're doing both
the calisthenics and the weightlifting.

1832
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:28,870
And actually I was reading something
about it the other day and it's becoming

1833
02:01:28,871 --> 02:01:33,760
more weightlifting focused and you know,
whether it's Olympic, what is crossfit?

1834
02:01:33,761 --> 02:01:36,280
The crossfit, I shouldn't say
it's getting that more focused,

1835
02:01:36,281 --> 02:01:40,520
but if you want to win the crossfit games,

1836
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:42,770
you got to be able to
lift some heavy weights.

1837
02:01:42,771 --> 02:01:47,240
You got to be able to dead lift a lot,
snatch a lot, clean and jerk a lot.

1838
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:52,010
And if you can dead lift a lot,
clean and jerk a lot and snatch a lot,

1839
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,730
you're going to be able to do. And at
least you practice the other movements,

1840
02:01:55,731 --> 02:01:58,400
the muscle up, the pull
ups, you're gonna be,

1841
02:01:58,401 --> 02:02:03,401
you're gonna be much more apt to be able
to do those things then the other way

1842
02:02:03,501 --> 02:02:04,070
around.

1843
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:08,980
Hmm. So I mean it's for somebody that can

1844
02:02:09,930 --> 02:02:14,930
do a bodyweight snatch is more likely
to be able to do 50 pull ups in a row,

1845
02:02:16,860 --> 02:02:19,920
then somebody that's able to do 50 popes
in the role and that's their focus in

1846
02:02:19,921 --> 02:02:23,550
life is able to automatically
do a bodyweight snatch. I mean,

1847
02:02:23,551 --> 02:02:28,250
that's just the reality of it.
That's what I think right now. Um,

1848
02:02:28,770 --> 02:02:31,880
but the bottom line is on those,
I use both of them. I find,

1849
02:02:31,890 --> 02:02:36,890
I like to try and find that balance and
I think I use both of them according to

1850
02:02:37,081 --> 02:02:39,570
what my body prescribes me

1851
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:46,320
and a lot of this stuff,
putting the book together,

1852
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:48,300
that fitness Ebook.

1853
02:02:49,020 --> 02:02:53,430
So I got some folks that are helping
me out with it and they're gonna,

1854
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:55,200
they're gonna, you know,
I'm gonna put these,

1855
02:02:55,620 --> 02:02:59,070
these things into the
fitness ebook at some point.

1856
02:02:59,430 --> 02:03:01,920
I don't know when it's going to get out.
This stuff takes a long,

1857
02:03:01,950 --> 02:03:03,330
you don't think it's going to take long.

1858
02:03:03,720 --> 02:03:06,870
Amen. But it does, it's um,

1859
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:10,740
the cal settings versus weights.
Um,

1860
02:03:11,520 --> 02:03:16,250
it depends fully on what result
you want. Good. That is true.

1861
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:19,610
So I think a lot of times you speak
kind of from the same, you know,

1862
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:21,710
with the same results in mine,

1863
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:26,090
but like if you want
to put on muscle mass,

1864
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:30,910
it's real cut and dry. That weight
is gonna is gonna help you. Um,

1865
02:03:31,690 --> 02:03:35,340
and again, what's in my
opinion, interesting with, um,

1866
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:39,950
like Kenneth Calisthenics. It's
a, uh, bodyweight squats, right?

1867
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:44,180
Anything where you're pushing
your own body through space,

1868
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:45,800
not necessarily with the weight,

1869
02:03:45,801 --> 02:03:49,790
but as far as that exercise has
more neuromuscular activation.

1870
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:54,570
So if you do squats rather than leg
press that has more neuromuscular

1871
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:59,210
activation. Oh yeah. But I mean,
I'm not saying that the, the,

1872
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:04,340
but you're talking about also weighted
squats. Yes, exactly. Yeah, yeah.

1873
02:04:04,370 --> 02:04:07,840
Forever. Yeah. So basically
what I'm saying is it's kind of,

1874
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:12,500
I haven't used any kind of
like weightlifting machine
and I don't remember how

1875
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:17,090
long. Yeah. So like curls. You know
how you always do curls all the time.

1876
02:04:17,091 --> 02:04:18,020
Like if you did,

1877
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:25,370
somebody said the other day somebody
posted a picture of some of the bumper

1878
02:04:25,371 --> 02:04:27,710
stickers on their squat
rack and somebody said,

1879
02:04:27,711 --> 02:04:31,390
we need to make a bumper sticker
that said like this is a no Korean,

1880
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:35,030
which I got it, which I got a big
kick out of. And you know what though?

1881
02:04:35,360 --> 02:04:39,530
I will say this. That being said, I
don't think I've said that this. Sure.

1882
02:04:39,810 --> 02:04:43,710
I'll tell you what. I have a bicep that's
been a little bit bothersome. You know,

1883
02:04:43,711 --> 02:04:46,160
it's got a little tweak in it for a while.
Yeah,

1884
02:04:46,170 --> 02:04:51,170
it's been like that for awhile and I
actually will now do some curls to get

1885
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,980
this, just to get that full range
of motion with some weight on it.

1886
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,930
And I feel like that is,

1887
02:04:57,931 --> 02:05:02,931
I feel like I should have kept doing curls
and maybe I injured my bicep a little

1888
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:07,680
bit from the lack of some focus
training around it. I could be wrong,

1889
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:08,401
I could be wrong,

1890
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:13,401
but I feel suspect of my
training methodology because
I hadn't done curls and a

1891
02:05:13,891 --> 02:05:15,690
long, long time because, you
know, you're thinking, hey,

1892
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:20,340
why would I do curls when I can do cleans?
Right, sir? That's, that's sort of a,

1893
02:05:20,640 --> 02:05:22,860
that's my mentality. But
now I think, you know,

1894
02:05:22,861 --> 02:05:27,000
what do cleans and then it
wasn't curls to, you know,

1895
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:30,240
work the bias of it. And the same thing
with, uh, with, uh, with the triceps.

1896
02:05:30,780 --> 02:05:35,780
And the same thing with all these
movements that I kind of tend to blow off

1897
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:38,520
because they're not full
body multi joint movements,

1898
02:05:38,521 --> 02:05:42,630
which is sort of the gospel of strength
and conditioning. Um, you know,

1899
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:45,450
I want to do squats, I want to do dead
lifts, I want to do clean and jerks.

1900
02:05:45,451 --> 02:05:50,100
I want to do these movements
where I'm using my whole
body. But I think, you know,

1901
02:05:50,101 --> 02:05:53,580
what,
why not accent those with some,

1902
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:57,240
a little bit more focused just for the,

1903
02:05:58,080 --> 02:06:02,140
the additional work on a
focused area, the, and that,

1904
02:06:02,150 --> 02:06:06,280
and the benefit that, that gives you a
strength in that specific spot. So, yeah,

1905
02:06:06,450 --> 02:06:10,950
I'm sure. Uh, I'd love to
hear some opinions about
that on, you know, somebody,

1906
02:06:10,951 --> 02:06:15,951
you get some feedback to me and tell me
I'm either an idiot that evening or that

1907
02:06:16,051 --> 02:06:17,010
those are correct.

1908
02:06:17,011 --> 02:06:20,250
And if I hope I hear it's correct cause
I'll do it more than I do right now.

1909
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,670
What, like curls and stuff.
Just, just, just more folks,

1910
02:06:22,671 --> 02:06:24,660
some focused body part exercises.

1911
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:28,000
Well again,
and I think this is really important and

1912
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:31,810
of course you're working
out for you of course.

1913
02:06:31,811 --> 02:06:33,580
I mean that's just the
nature of working out.

1914
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:36,510
You can't and someone else can't get your
results from your work, you know? Right.

1915
02:06:37,240 --> 02:06:39,160
So again,
like I said,

1916
02:06:39,190 --> 02:06:42,590
it depends on what you want
out of working out. True.

1917
02:06:42,610 --> 02:06:45,430
So you know how you just said,
that's the gospel of,

1918
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:47,320
of strength and conditioning
is that a full body weight.

1919
02:06:47,321 --> 02:06:51,010
So you prefer these things.
That's not everybody, you know.

1920
02:06:51,011 --> 02:06:54,820
So if let's say someone who's, you know,
he's worked in the office or whatever,

1921
02:06:54,821 --> 02:06:56,950
he wants to lose some weight
or he's kind of a, you know,

1922
02:06:56,951 --> 02:07:01,050
more of a skinny person and he wants to
put on muscle mass for a bunch of reason.

1923
02:07:01,051 --> 02:07:03,790
He wanted to get stronger.
He wants to be able to like push press.

1924
02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:07,120
Those people should do squat and dead
lift. Sure, yeah, agreed. Agreed.

1925
02:07:07,180 --> 02:07:10,450
But if you want to put on muscle mass,

1926
02:07:10,451 --> 02:07:15,160
like in your shoulders or your arms, both,
everything you do these other things,

1927
02:07:15,161 --> 02:07:17,830
curls, you know, not everyone's for that,

1928
02:07:18,040 --> 02:07:21,850
but that's not to say that that's
not a benefit Fishel type of workup.

1929
02:07:22,450 --> 02:07:26,490
That's a reality. Yeah. Not a
reality that I choose to participate.

1930
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:29,380
You're already kind of, you know, you
have muscle mass, so it's easy, you know,

1931
02:07:31,090 --> 02:07:36,010
you see check yes. On hate on the
bodybuilding program. No, there's no heat

1932
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,930
coming from me. Not much. Anyways.
All right, cool. Last question.

1933
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:44,130
I'm going to write my ebook on.
Don't hate on the bodybuilding.

1934
02:07:46,420 --> 02:07:48,940
I want a copy Darko.

1935
02:07:50,080 --> 02:07:54,910
Do you ever compromise? And if so, when.

1936
02:07:57,250 --> 02:07:58,083
Okay.

1937
02:07:58,240 --> 02:08:03,240
When you're dealing with other people
in dynamic situations and relationships

1938
02:08:05,801 --> 02:08:09,700
and deals, you're trying to make
things happen. Of course, yes.

1939
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,410
In fact,
I mean in many aspects,

1940
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:17,050
leadership is really all about compromise,

1941
02:08:17,820 --> 02:08:22,820
about finding the common ground between
different teams and merging different

1942
02:08:23,921 --> 02:08:28,921
approaches to the same problem in
bridging these personalities of the people

1943
02:08:30,851 --> 02:08:34,570
that don't get along with each other
that you might not get along with

1944
02:08:37,870 --> 02:08:42,640
reaching agreements in different
courses of actions, all these things,

1945
02:08:43,650 --> 02:08:46,900
they all require compromise

1946
02:08:49,110 --> 02:08:54,110
and actually in many cases the failure
to compromise is a failure to succeed.

1947
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:58,050
That's just the way it is.

1948
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:02,760
But those,

1949
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:08,750
of course those are all external
compromises with other people,

1950
02:09:09,121 --> 02:09:14,121
other human beings that have their own
personalities and egos and issues and you

1951
02:09:20,191 --> 02:09:23,790
as a person or I,
I have to work with them.

1952
02:09:24,870 --> 02:09:27,450
I have to make some compromises with them

1953
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:30,190
cause they're not me.

1954
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:36,910
But internally it's different.

1955
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,850
I mean with myself,
I have to hold the line

1956
02:09:45,050 --> 02:09:49,770
and there's areas within myself
where I cannot compromise.

1957
02:09:51,430 --> 02:09:54,820
I'm going to work hard,
I'm going to train hard,

1958
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:58,450
I'm going to try and improve myself.

1959
02:10:00,440 --> 02:10:04,820
I'm going to own my mistakes,
I'm going to confront them.

1960
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:11,900
I'm gonna face my demons

1961
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:18,430
and I'm not gonna give up
or give out or give in.

1962
02:10:18,490 --> 02:10:20,020
I'm going to stand

1963
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:27,040
and I'm going to maintain
my personal self discipline.

1964
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:33,510
They do my utmost

1965
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:39,040
to live a life that is worthy

1966
02:10:41,290 --> 02:10:43,120
of the sacrifices

1967
02:10:45,430 --> 02:10:49,540
that were made for me and for us.

1968
02:10:51,860 --> 02:10:53,240
And on those points

1969
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:59,660
there will be no compromise.

1970
02:11:01,490 --> 02:11:06,330
Yeah. Not now. Not ever

1971
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:17,020
good.
I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1972
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:19,493
So

1973
02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:25,480
thanks to all youtubers out there for
tuning in and listening and thanks for,

1974
02:11:28,430 --> 02:11:33,430
thanks for gutting it out when it gets
dark here and we start talking about the

1975
02:11:34,101 --> 02:11:35,090
horror,

1976
02:11:38,440 --> 02:11:41,860
the horror tonight and one soldiers war.

1977
02:11:42,010 --> 02:11:44,430
And when we did it with the forgotten
the Highlander and we did it with a

1978
02:11:44,431 --> 02:11:48,160
machete season,
I know it's hard to listen to,

1979
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:52,740
but I'll tell you,

1980
02:11:55,280 --> 02:12:00,280
doesn't it just make the sunrise in
the morning that much more glorious

1981
02:12:03,870 --> 02:12:06,380
when the light comes into your world.

1982
02:12:08,220 --> 02:12:13,220
So thanks for connecting with us
through the interweb that this book was

1983
02:12:13,351 --> 02:12:15,300
actually from people on Twitter.

1984
02:12:16,360 --> 02:12:16,610
Okay.

1985
02:12:16,610 --> 02:12:21,050
So you all made me smarter and made
me better and gave me a different

1986
02:12:21,051 --> 02:12:25,850
perspective. So thank you for doing
that. Thanks for supporting the podcast,

Babin,
my brother from the seal teams,

2003
02:13:26,060 --> 02:13:29,320
and that's available in hardcover,
kindle or audio,

2004
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:34,140
the audio book Lafe and I actually, the
chapters that we wrote, so if he had,

2005
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:38,130
if you like listening to this, maybe you
like listening to that, check it out.

2006
02:13:38,400 --> 02:13:41,920
And as always,
Oh,

2007
02:13:41,921 --> 02:13:46,600
you troopers out there in the
field out there battling demons,

2008
02:13:47,860 --> 02:13:52,860
be they fear or guilt or alcohol or sugar
or ego or anger or procrastination or

2009
02:13:56,350 --> 02:14:01,030
whatever form of weakness
you are up against.

2010
02:14:03,640 --> 02:14:07,900
Fight those demons. Take
the fight to them, stand up,

2011
02:14:08,110 --> 02:14:11,940
face them,
get after it.

2012
02:14:15,180 --> 02:14:19,230
Until next time,
this is Jocko and deco

2013
02:14:21,110 --> 02:14:21,590
out.
