This is Jocko podcast number
one 26 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,353
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,750
Good evening echo from good evening and
tonight also joining us is Mr. David

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,770
Burke. Good evening Dave. Good evening.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,430
On September 27th,

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,430
1950 approximately 60 American prisoners
who had been confined in prison were

7
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:30,810
taken into the prison yard and groups
of 14 with their hands wired together.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,210
These men were forced to sit,
hunched in,

9
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:41,100
hastily dug ditches and then were shot
by North Korean troops at point blank

10
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:45,930
range with American m one rifles
using armor piercing ammunition

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,430
of the two seriously wounded survivors.

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,800
Only one lived to recount
the gruesome details

13
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,470
on of civilians estimated at between
5,000 and 7,000 and as well as soldiers of

14
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:09,931
the Republic of Korea or also slaughtered
between September 23rd and September

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,693
27th,
1950

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,820
Sergeant Carrie h y now formally
with the 23rd Infantry Regiment.

17
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:25,631
Second Division Korea was the sole
survivor of the infamous infamous Tasia on

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,930
massacre
and he testified

19
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,300
at a congressional hearing and I'm
going to read some of that transcript.

20
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,370
Here's sergeant,
why now?

21
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,640
Toward the last,

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,510
they was in a hurry to leave
Tayshaun to evacuate Tasia on.

23
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,260
So they took approximately the last
three groups pretty close together.

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,240
I witnessed the group
right in front of me shot.

25
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:54,790
Okay.

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,080
After they were shot,

27
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,520
we was taken to the ditch and
sat down in the ditch and shot.

28
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,500
And then Senator Potter asks what
happened to you when you were shot?

29
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,443
Yeah,

30
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,930
sergeant. Why? L replies,

31
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,560
I leaned over against the next
man pretending I was done for

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:15,640
okay.

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,620
In firing.
They hit my hand.

34
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,470
Yeah.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,000
Senator Potter. How were you
sitting in the ditch? Sergeant.

36
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:28,320
Why now? They was aiming at my
head. I have a scar on my neck,

37
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,670
one on my collarbone and another in
my hand. They hit me three times.

38
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,460
And you play dead? Yes sir. After
they thought everyone was dead,

39
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,350
they started burying us.

40
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,690
I came pretty close to getting panicky
about that time, but somehow or another,

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,220
I figured as long as I had some breadth,
there was hope.

42
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,160
In other words, you were buried
alive. That is right, sir.

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,350
I add in that whole group that I was with,

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,390
there was not a man that begged for mercy
and there was not a man that cracked

45
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,460
under the ordeal
sergeant.

46
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,060
How long were you buried alive?
That is hard to say, sir.

47
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,711
As I say,

48
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:21,190
I was shot around five o'clock in the
morning and I stayed in the ditch until

49
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:24,070
that evening until what time?
It was dark.

50
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,330
I would say approximately eight hours.
Seven or eight hours.

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Now that is from a report on Korean War
atrocities written by the subcommittee

52
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,400
on Korean War investigations.

53
00:03:43,401 --> 00:03:47,750
And I want to repeat one line
again from sergeant. Why now?

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,360
He says in that whole
group that I was with,

55
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,420
there was not a man that begged for mercy
and there was not a man that cracked

56
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,770
under the ordeal.

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,440
So think about that.

58
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:14,170
Think about the will and the discipline
of those men to be facing certain death

59
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,610
at the hands of the murderous enemy,

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,940
but to face death with solve them
silence and show no signs of breaking.

61
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,200
And I've said before that war
brings out the worst in people,

62
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:36,440
but it also brings out the best

63
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,740
and that is but one of thousands upon
thousands of examples of the dedication of

64
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,810
our military fighting men.

65
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,250
And I'm going to read you another
example from the same bor around the same

66
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:59,130
time,
but this one is an award citation

67
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,303
and it reads,

68
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,910
the president of the United States of
America takes pleasure in presenting the

69
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:08,940
silver star to first lieutenant armor,

70
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,360
Thomas Wilford Fife United States army
for Gallantry in action as a member of

71
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,060
company B 72nd tank battalion,

72
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,150
Second Infantry Division in action
against an armed enemy on 19 September,

73
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,440
1950 in the vicinity of young
saying Korea. On that date,

74
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,240
Lieutenant Phife was in command of a
platoon of tanks charged with the support

75
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,390
of infantry elements.
In the defense of young saying perimeter,

76
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,460
the enemy attacked his position
with superior numbers and a fanatic

77
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:46,461
determination to penetrate through
to the division main supply route.

78
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,470
The enemy attack was successful in routing
the friendly elements and inflicting

79
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:56,370
casualties to the extent
that the organization and
combat effectiveness of the

80
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:58,790
positions was completely disrupted.

81
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,800
Realizing the seriousness
of the situation,

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,410
Lieutenant Fife disregarded
the heavy enemy,

83
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:11,390
fire and dismounted from the protective
armor of his tank to reorganize the foot

84
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,870
elements.
After reorganization,

85
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,070
he remained on the ground and successfully
reestablished the positions by

86
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:24,360
controlling both the foot elements
and his tanks by means of radio

87
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:28,670
communications.
During this same date,

88
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,790
while engaged in a friendly
attack against the enemy,

89
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,690
lieutenant fife again displayed
gallantry by refusing evacuation.

90
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:39,620
After being wounded,
the leadership,

91
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,540
loyalty and gallon actions demonstrated
that day by lieutenant fife are in

92
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,740
keeping with the highest
traditions of the military service.

93
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,760
So Lieutenant Phife was under
attack from devastating enemy fire,

94
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,450
but he did not remain in the protection
of his tank. In fact, he did the opposite.

95
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:07,080
He exited his tank to organize
troops and stop the enemy attack.

96
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:09,990
He risked his life to lead his men.

97
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,900
Then he would continue to
lead even after wounded. Now,

98
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:21,220
Korea was not the first war
for Lieutenant Tom Fife,

99
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:27,850
nor would it be his last lieutenant fife
had actually already fought in World

100
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,913
War II.

101
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:35,150
He fought in Korea and
he fought in Vietnam.

102
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,450
He also received three Purple Hearts for
each of the three times he was wounded

103
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:45,680
once in each war and in addition
to the silver star from Korea,

104
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:50,681
he also received another silver star for
his service in Vietnam and a Legion of

105
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:56,051
Merit and a distinguished flying cross
and survived all that and served our

106
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:00,560
great nation for 25 years.

107
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,290
And I will say that it is my absolute
honor to have retired Colonel Thomas Fife

108
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,280
on the podcast today.

109
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,710
Sir,
thank you for coming on.

110
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,970
It's nice to be here.
I think

111
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,890
I listen to that story.

112
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,810
It brought back gears.
Quite frankly,

113
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,180
I'm upset just because
of the memory of that.

114
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,120
It was a horrible experience,

115
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:45,610
but one that had to get
done and I still remember

116
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,130
getting out of that tank and wondering
why in the hell I was doing it.

117
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,410
But
something had to done.

118
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,150
When you see thousands of people coming
at you and you have nothing but your

119
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,303
weapons

120
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,860
and the guys needed some help.
They just,

121
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,713
they were willing to

122
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,290
I guess, run. I don't know
what that was, what they were,

123
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,020
they needed leadership and that's the
only thing I could think of to get out and

124
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,300
try to be there with them.

125
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,260
And thank God we turned them around
and we were able to stop the enemy.

126
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:35,980
Okay,

127
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,980
you can't understand what it's like to
be there and having thousands of people

128
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:47,251
compression at you in the best you can
do is shoot your tank guns and machine

129
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:52,540
guns. And he just kept coming
and she just kept coming. I mean,

130
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,070
talk about discipline is, those
guys were disciplined too. And uh,

131
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,870
we had to get our guys together
and we did. And it was,

132
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,500
I think I was lucky. I
was damn lucky by the way.

133
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,210
My wounds weren't dead serious.

134
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:13,780
I got shot in the ass and it closed up.

135
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,690
The wound closed up and so
it stopped bleeding. And

136
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,570
for all practical purposes,
I was as good as new for a while.

137
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,060
So, I mean, it wasn't that
serious a wound. I mean,

138
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,213
I,

139
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,910
I'd hope to be evacuated
to Japan but didn't work.

140
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,040
So, so your million dollar wound turned
out to be like a 50 cent was again,

141
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,350
at least it was, it was, uh, you know,

142
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:50,020
you, when you, when I got wounded,

143
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,220
I felt the blood rush into my pants

144
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,040
and then it stopped.

145
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,090
So why not keep going so
far as that's concerned?

146
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,800
The wound was debt over it.

147
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,390
And when I finally got to the
Mash Hospital, the doctor said,

148
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,760
that's when we can do for you.
It's going to work.

149
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:14,860
It's way out or stay there forever.

150
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,820
It eventually worked his way out,

151
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,580
which is how I have
ended up being evacuated

152
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,120
when we were up in North Korea
and, uh, got to a hospital ship,

153
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,000
Navy hospital ship,
and they

154
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
took the piece of metal out of my butt.
And

155
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,450
then MacArthur just said,
general MacArthur had said,

156
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,030
we're going to be home
by thinks by Christmas.

157
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,720
So my objective is get off
that hospital ship as fast.

158
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:52,600
I couldn't get back to my unit.
And

159
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,630
of course the Chinese hit.
Yeah.

160
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,460
And so I was now trying
to get back to my unit

161
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,410
in the army was totally screw it
up. We didn't know where, who was.

162
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,293
So I ended up

163
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,250
to be young Yang Gland in and [inaudible]
the capital of North Korea and the

164
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,470
airfield was totally surrounded by fire.

165
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,130
We were destroying all of our
equipment and whatever else.

166
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,680
We I our plane,

167
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,460
the plane landed and I
had to go find my unit.

168
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,260
Nobody knew where it was. So I got
on the road and started hitchhiking.

169
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:46,790
Yeah.

170
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,790
That's the guy who came along who happened
to be a classmate of mine who was in

171
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:55,810
Salem car. He stopped, saw me pick me up,

172
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,880
don't we backed him where he was,

173
00:12:57,881 --> 00:13:01,810
which was core headquarters and they
didn't know where and how am I afraid it

174
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:06,310
was. So finally he told me
back to the mash hospital,

175
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,490
another mash hospital and
the Mash Hospital knew where
my unit was and they took

176
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:17,710
me back to my inner in an ambulance.
I wasn't wounded.

177
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,430
Just a way to convey,
get me back to my unit.

178
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,310
I still remember those days.
Terrible experience,

179
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,223
but fun.

180
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:33,000
It's hard for people to understand that.
Again,

181
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,630
I have that discussion with people
a lot when you're saying, hey,

182
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:40,680
this was the worst time of my life
and also the best time of my life.

183
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:45,280
At the same time, let's,
uh, let's, I mean we'll,

184
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,290
let's get into Korea,

185
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:51,060
but let's talk a little bit about sort
of where you came from, how you grew up.

186
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,510
Um, starting with, uh, I
guess Sioux City, Iowa.

187
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:58,270
That's right.
Well,

188
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,323
I was

189
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,170
a kid growing up in the middle
of the United States. Uh,

190
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,420
I was reminded on the way over here,
I wish talking

191
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,830
when Pearl Harbor happened,

192
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:22,270
I was 16 or almost 16 years old.

193
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:27,271
I was in a movie theater and they
staffed the movie and he announced that

194
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,010
Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor.

195
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,320
I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was.

196
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,470
Now I knew where the
Hawaiian islands where,

197
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:41,390
but I didn't know Pearl Harbor was
in the Hawaiian islands. You'll,

198
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,220
when you're an Iowa v,
there's no oceans. Nobody,

199
00:14:46,221 --> 00:14:50,130
not nobody.
You don't think about oceans.

200
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,460
And so here we were in this movie
and I was almost 16 as I said,

201
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,640
and I said, Oh hell, the world be
over before I ever get called in.

202
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,380
Well, that turned out to be wrong. So, uh,

203
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,910
as I said,
I was going through high school.

204
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,690
My whole objective,
why was in high school,

205
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:18,800
it's going to become a chemical
engineer and go to Cornell University.

206
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,940
Why?
Because my best friend's

207
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,340
oldest brother-in-law was,

208
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,090
was a chemical engineer
working in Sumatra.

209
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,360
What may you grown up on? Io Sumatra sound
like a pretty good thing to be doing.

210
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:43,040
So I asked who I wanted to be a chemical
engineer and I was going to go to

211
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:47,720
Cornell because he went to Cornell and
that was going to be what I was going to

212
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:50,900
do. Well, the war happened

213
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,710
and I suddenly became
18 and you get drafted.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,250
It's hard for people to realize today,

215
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,480
every place you go,
people who are in uniform,

216
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,080
when people walking around
in civilian clothes,

217
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:14,300
the only people who were in civilian
clothes or those who couldn't qualify

218
00:16:14,301 --> 00:16:17,810
because of physical disabilities.

219
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,260
So everybody was in uniform
no matter where you weren't.

220
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,050
So I got drafted
and fortunately

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
my dad was smart enough to send me off
to Iowa state before I was 18 and I got

222
00:16:35,481 --> 00:16:40,280
two quarters in as an engineer.
So the army has great wisdom,

223
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,460
decided to debate me,
accommodate engineer,

224
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,520
which was a hell of a lot
better than being an infant.

225
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,930
But as far as I was concerned.

226
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,300
So I went to Fort Jackson,
South Carolina.

227
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,030
Now when you're from Sioux
City, Iowa, Columbia,

228
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,750
South Carolina is eons away.

229
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,460
It took us five days on a
damn train to get there.

230
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,530
So we got there in all of us
soldiers get off the train.

231
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:20,290
And this first sergeant got
us all lined up there and uh,

232
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:27,280
he's calling role and he
says Fifi and I l five.

233
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,430
And from that moment on, I was Fifi. And

234
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,320
so anyway,
the,

235
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,080
that was in March of 1944 44.

236
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,210
And so we went to basic training.

237
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,730
It learned to be a competent engineer.

238
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,330
And I became a demolition specialists.

239
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,710
Now it's hard for people to realize,

240
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,310
here's a kid who grows up in Sioux city,

241
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:09,420
Iowa and suddenly is handling explosives.

242
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,290
I had no more idea of doing
that in a man in the moon.

243
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,060
So
in the training,

244
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,540
we were primarily learning to build
bridges and take care of roads.

245
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,810
That was our primary mission.
But we're also,

246
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,950
we're taught to be instrument combat
engineers have a secondary responsibility.

247
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,180
And so we, uh, ended up,

248
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,920
uh,
fortunately going to Europe

249
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,900
when we were in training, we had no idea
which direction we were going to go.

250
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,280
But in retrospect,

251
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:01,260
I've always felt that we were lucky
to go to Europe rather than to the

252
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,640
southeast. However, uh,

253
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,170
when I got to Europe,

254
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,750
it was colder than hell.

255
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,360
I wasn't so sure that was a really big
decision, but it worked out all right.

256
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,553
But,
uh,

257
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,040
but our primary role was
to go to Europe and become,

258
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,740
uh, take care of the roads and, uh,

259
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,530
all the things that engineers do.
It's a,

260
00:19:28,531 --> 00:19:31,990
you showed up there is where you
write it around the, the battle,

261
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,260
the bolts timeframe. Yes. I mean the bad,

262
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:41,290
the bulge was as I remember right
around Christmas time of 1944,

263
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,280
44.
Yeah.

264
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,450
And we got to the continent
right at that time.

265
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,500
But I unit went to Luxembourg.
Uh,

266
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,230
it primarily was helping

267
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,230
General Patton's army turn,

268
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,620
make a 90 degree turn and go
north to help stop the Germans.

269
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,820
And so the roads had to
be taken care of and,

270
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,840
and that's what our unit was doing.
So we prime during the,

271
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,280
the actual combat have best Tom.

272
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,820
We were working on roads and
keeping the roads open for the,

273
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,150
uh, Patton's army to get up there. Uh,

274
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,100
our unit
eventually,

275
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,200
uh,
eliminated the Germans,

276
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,050
the last Germans from Luxembourg in
the little town called [inaudible],

277
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:56,830
which is on the Yarra river right across
from the Sig free border for a secret

278
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,330
line. And, uh,

279
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,440
so the 1250 fifth engineer combat
battalion turned in an infantry outfit for

280
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,220
brief, very time. February 12th, 1945,

281
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,310
we got rid of all the Germans,

282
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,610
glass Germans in its
country of Luxembourg,

283
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,180
combat engineers. We
always, I always have to,

284
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,290
we'll always want to give them their
due because they continue to keep roads

285
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:28,891
open.
And when,

286
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:32,730
when when we were fighting in Ramadi
was the combat engineers primarily that

287
00:21:32,731 --> 00:21:37,020
they had the duty of of mine clearance
and it was a brutal and date,

288
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,530
I mean obviously a highly dangerous job
for them to be out there clearing those

289
00:21:40,531 --> 00:21:43,410
minds and keeping those roads open.
That's a, it's a hell of a job.

290
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,613
Well,

291
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,010
as a demolition specialists,
one of my other,

292
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,590
one of my jobs was mine,

293
00:21:52,591 --> 00:21:57,591
Clarence and I was operating
a mine sweeper on this road
down into the valley at

294
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:05,781
the end and and behind me where the were
two tanks from the calvary unit and the

295
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:15,720
Germans could see the tanks.
I guess they could see us too,

296
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:17,750
but they sure the hell was,

297
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,290
she could looking at the tanks and
shooting at the tanks and a lot of their

298
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,140
machine gun fire wood ricocheted off
the tanks and that's how I got hit with

299
00:22:30,991 --> 00:22:33,270
ricochet off the damn tank.

300
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,390
Got into my leg and arm.
But superficially,

301
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:42,210
I mean all I just go back to age station,

302
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,950
get bandaged up and back into my unit.
It wasn't,

303
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:48,870
wasn't any a hospitalization at all,
that kind of stuff.

304
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,310
Another 50 cent wound for it.
Exactly. I'd be, I had a lot of those.

305
00:22:55,150 --> 00:23:00,100
So how long were you, so did you stay
over over in Europe until the war ended?

306
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,170
No, I actually, actually in March, uh,

307
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,740
the unit got orders for me to return
to the United States because I had

308
00:23:10,741 --> 00:23:12,960
appointments in the United
States military academy.

309
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,620
And so my very first airplane
ride was from Lee Age,

310
00:23:19,081 --> 00:23:22,110
Belgium to Paris.
And I was,

311
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,770
I remember going into this office in
Paris and I was dressed in my battle gear,

312
00:23:30,181 --> 00:23:33,700
so to speak, and they'd looked
at me and he said, and I had,

313
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:38,320
it's still over the where I was still
wearing my steel helmet and the, and the,

314
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:44,040
I can still remember this is sergeant
scene. We've got to take care of this guy.

315
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:44,880
We got to dress him.

316
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,210
And so they put me in
all brand new clothes.

317
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:55,460
Two days later, I was on an airplane
flying back to United States.

318
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:01,250
27 hours later in five stops in route.

319
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,660
We ended up in Washington DC.
So,

320
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,320
and so I ended up my first
time it ever visit to Pentagon.

321
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,343
Here's this

322
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,290
19 year old PFC dressed
in brand new clothes,

323
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,420
walking into the Pentagon.
And I can tell you,

324
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:33,170
I wasn't sure what the hell I was doing
when I finally got orders to go to

325
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:37,500
Cornell University,
Cornell University,

326
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:42,120
but for to get re academic,
uh,

327
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,740
get reoriented towards academics.

328
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:48,320
So wait,
so you had orders to west point,

329
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,560
but they were going to send you to Cornell
for a little while to prepare for it?

330
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,480
Well, no, I had

331
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,320
an appointment to the academy.
Okay.

332
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,230
If you had an appointment as academy,
in fact, this is still true today.

333
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,280
If you're having an
appointment of the academy,

334
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:11,281
they've take you out of combat and
bring you back some place safe.

335
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,230
And what they brought us back.

336
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,800
There was about 300 of us at Cornell,
all uh,

337
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,250
from different parts of the service,
whether it be army, air force,

338
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,040
back downstairs. It was US army,
air corps, and uh, we were there

339
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,900
for them to get re

340
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:42,480
acclimated to the academia. Turn
your brain back on. Yeah. Thank you.

341
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,680
And so that was, at this
point, did you know,

342
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,070
did you know you wanted to
stay in the army as a career?

343
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:52,860
Had you enjoyed your time in
Europe? And he said, you know what,

344
00:25:52,861 --> 00:25:55,650
I think I'm going to do think
them to go the distance or no,

345
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,480
I had no, I had no idea.
It wasn't until after.

346
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,450
Well,
very quickly

347
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,830
my appointment to the academy
was an alternate appointment
and is the principal,

348
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,680
if he qualifies, the alternate doesn't
get to go in. My principal qualified.

349
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:27,220
So now where they do with
me in the earliest great,

350
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,350
infinite wisdom decided to send
me to officer candidate school.

351
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,180
So they sent me down to Fort Belvoir
to the engineer officer Candy School.

352
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:41,990
The army knew they're going to need a
lot of second lieutenants over in the

353
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,790
Southeast Asia.
And so anyway,

354
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,180
in the middle of officer candidate
school and warrant Japan ended.

355
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,780
Now what? Well, they stopped
officer caddies based,

356
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,000
slow it down I guess is the right word.
And,

357
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,190
but I continued on in, graduated, uh,

358
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,530
into January of 1945 and here
I wasn't out to set lieutenant.

359
00:27:08,741 --> 00:27:12,230
So you've got your commission.
Yeah, and I had an and I,

360
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,110
and now I also had a principal
appointment to the military academy,

361
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,660
so whether they do it,

362
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,200
so they kept me at Fort
Belvoir training recruits.

363
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,580
And then in July they discharged me from
the army to enter the military academy

364
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:34,200
as a cadet. And July 1st, 1946

365
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,830
it was somewhere in there

366
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,013
that

367
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,340
I started to like the army.

368
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,323
Got It.

369
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,810
But I knew if I wanted to be an engineer,

370
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:52,610
I damn well had to get a college
education. Well, we're better to go,

371
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,980
going to placements, supposed to
train you to be an army engineer,

372
00:27:57,981 --> 00:28:01,700
which is this case west point.
So I could,

373
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:06,020
I went onto west wine and spent
four years there obviously,

374
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,300
and graduated in 1950.

375
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,720
So you got commissioned, they took your
king mission away for four years. He got,

376
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,280
and then they give it back
to you at the end of 40 days.

377
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,850
We only rank I've ever had was in the
army with twice my second lieutenant.

378
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,403
Yes,
that's right.

379
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:24,733
Eh,
sir.

380
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:29,610
In West Point at this point is being
run by just all World War II veterans of

381
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,440
I'm sure.

382
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes. In fact, a r e m

383
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,730
our tactical officers who were all
lieutenant colonels who had been battalion

384
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:49,061
commanders of some short in World
War II in Europe or in the air force,

385
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,730
tactical tactical officer of my company.

386
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:00,740
The first two years was an artilleryman.
And the second two years was, uh,

387
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:04,160
uh, uh, air force. Well,

388
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:09,650
it was US Army Air Corps became the
air force, uh, lieutenant colonel.

389
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,810
So it ended,

390
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,080
the superintendent was a Maxwell Taylor
and a common dant was guiding the

391
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,730
Paulding Harkins who was colonel hearkens.
He was a gentle patents,

392
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,840
a hatchet man.
And uh,

393
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,110
and the deputy commandant was a guy.

394
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,120
But John Kay waters who was
a general patent sending law.

395
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,550
So,
uh,

396
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,990
so they were all when

397
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,990
World War II veterans. Yes. And, and
as were you at the time that had to be,

398
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,370
was that fairly unique or was there a lot
of other guys that were prior enlisted

399
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,490
that were coming to west point?
Um,

400
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,630
uh,

401
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:02,290
my class who started about 1100 of us,

402
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,160
uh,

403
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,450
I would guess several hundred
were veterans of some sort.

404
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,730
Uh, Navy Army, army,

405
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,710
air corps. Uh, yes.

406
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,240
I would say about two or 200.
200 to 300.

407
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:24,070
I don't remember exactly.
Yeah.

408
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:29,230
Now when you're going through
west point, the war ends, are you,

409
00:30:29,231 --> 00:30:34,231
is his war on the horizon for you or did
you guys have an attitude kind of like,

410
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,620
well,
you know,

411
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,270
we're going to go and be peace time
army officers for the next however many

412
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:43,600
years?
Or did you see trouble brewing?

413
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,470
No, John, no trouble brewing. I mean,

414
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:52,770
I don't think anybody really herself
what was going to happen? Korea, uh,

415
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,400
in fact t z,

416
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:01,310
the only thing that was trouble if he
would was the Berlin airlift happened.

417
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,160
While we were it could it.

418
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,730
And so he saw that kind of thing.

419
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:13,380
But I guess in maybe in our naivety,

420
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:17,880
we figured that nobody was going
to pull the plug and really

421
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,460
have the Russians attack or vice versa,
where we're going to do anything. Uh,

422
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,020
see. So when you graduate,
what's your next move?

423
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:29,150
What was your next move
after you graduated?

424
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,670
Well,
it wasn't my move.

425
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,700
North Korea invaded South Korea and
here generally present Predator prey.

426
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,230
President Truman decided

427
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,520
to send to US troops to Korea.

428
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,670
Now one of the things when you,

429
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,590
when you graduate a
buy order rank,

430
00:31:56,591 --> 00:32:01,510
you're allowed to choose your branch
and then where you want to go.

431
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,350
Well,
my experience was

432
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,480
being in front of that tank and getting

433
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:16,000
shrapnel, I decided I didn't want
to be out in front of the tank.

434
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:18,800
I wanted to be in the tank.
So I chose,

435
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:23,860
I chose not to be an engineer's again.
I chose to go into the armor.

436
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,470
So I chose to go to once again,

437
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,893
uh,

438
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:35,380
grown up on Iowa state of
Washington was somewhere,

439
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,400
who knows where. So I chose
Fort Lewis, Washington.

440
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:42,320
There's a place I'd want to go visit.

441
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,030
So that's my first post was to
go to Fort Lewis, Washington.

442
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,320
Did it turned out to
be the 29th, 29th? No,

443
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,940
the 70 shagging tank battalion, which
was part of the Second Infantry Division.

444
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,770
President Truman,

445
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,930
while I was on my honeymoon in Canada,

446
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:10,260
decided to send a second
division off to Korea.

447
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,940
So in my infinite wisdom,

448
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,170
not knowing just what happening,
well,

449
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:22,290
I was in Canada and I called home to
wish my mother and Dad Happy 4th of July.

450
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,060
Oh,

451
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,650
G army had shin,
a telegram to my parents' house.

452
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,660
Shane for me,

453
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,650
get my ass for real estate
as soon as possible.

454
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,183
Well,

455
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:48,140
I'm halfway there when I'm up in Alberta,
Canada.

456
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,130
So we drive off to Fort Lewis.

457
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,230
And so I arrived at Fort
Lewis, uh, middle of July.

458
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,420
Now you got to,
I'm now a tank platoon leader.

459
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,210
Never been in a tank before.

460
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,980
Let me tell you actually an experience.
Most people don't want to have.

461
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,230
I, the only thing I had going, by the way,

462
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,090
many years later,
my platoon sergeant told me,

463
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:27,140
he said at that time he was my gunner.
He said,

464
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,960
we've fairly,
really fortunate.

465
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,380
We had a guy who had been
in combat in World War Two

466
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,150
not knowing that I didn't know
a damn thing about a tank,

467
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:44,060
but the good news is the sergeant was
smart enough to teach me how to be

468
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,560
somewhat of a tanker

469
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:52,720
on the ship on the way over to Korea.
So you had no, you, you showed up.

470
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,650
You were, you get done with your,
or you cut short your honeymoon,

471
00:34:56,651 --> 00:35:00,700
you go straight to Fort Lewis and
then you immediately glowed up.

472
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,430
Yes.
My first tank right west from the port,

473
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,610
not from the motor pool at Fort Lewis to
the port of Olympia to put the tank on

474
00:35:11,141 --> 00:35:15,760
the ship and goodbye.
That was my first tank.

475
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:20,300
Correct. Yeah. That's the point you made
about, you know, not just that you're,

476
00:35:20,301 --> 00:35:22,560
you're sergeant was smart
enough to teach you,

477
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:27,150
but equally important is that you are
smart enough to listen and we get all

478
00:35:27,151 --> 00:35:29,850
kinds of young officers and I'm sure you
saw him through the years that they're

479
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:32,390
not smart enough to listen to the
people that have the experience. And,

480
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,020
and that's a huge lesson learned yet
seems to always need to get learned by,

481
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,280
I wish I've told more people when asked,

482
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,750
what do you do to be successful?
I say listen to your sergeants,

483
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,680
listened to your sergeants,
asks them,

484
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:58,650
don't be afraid to ask because I'll
tell you their job is to make you

485
00:35:58,651 --> 00:35:59,580
successful.

486
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,510
And unfortunately there are too many
people who don't have egos that can allow

487
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,633
them to do that.

488
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,300
No doubt about it.

489
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,630
They think it's going to make them
look bad when it actually yes,

490
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:14,630
it actually elevates them in the
eyes of the sergeant. Yeah. And Yup.

491
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,650
So your trip overseas,

492
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:22,860
you're on the ship and
you show up in Korea.

493
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,933
Yes.

494
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,890
You can't understand

495
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,750
what it's like to be several
miles off shore and begin to smell

496
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,440
what's going to be turned out to beads.

497
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:46,610
Puerto Busan where you could smell it
before he ever got there and we knew we

498
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:49,320
were pulling into and hadn't never,

499
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,810
I've never been to that part of the
world and my whole life and we offloaded

500
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,200
ourselves from the troop ship,

501
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,110
waited for our tanks to come on the,

502
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,380
on the other ships and we spent four days
in in Pusan waiting for the equipment

503
00:37:10,871 --> 00:37:14,320
to come and then offloading it and
getting it ready to go into battle.

504
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,240
Then at what point this is,

505
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:22,930
this is like the battle of [inaudible].

506
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,400
This is the Pusan perimeter and this
is the beginning of it right now.

507
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:28,110
This is for those of you that don't know,

508
00:37:28,111 --> 00:37:29,790
this is North Korean troops coming down,

509
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:34,791
100,000 North Korean troops coming down
and have you guys basically squeezed on

510
00:37:35,291 --> 00:37:39,840
to, it's almost a peninsula. It's like
a little not have land that sticks out.

511
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,160
35 miles radius from the
shitty of who Sean was,

512
00:37:45,171 --> 00:37:49,100
the Pusan perimeter.
That was the last character he held.

513
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,490
Everything else was held
by the North Koreans.

514
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,710
It's so when you landed there, that's
the situation they were in. Yes.

515
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,960
And how did you guys, and how did
you and your troops feel about that?

516
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,980
I don't think we were even cognitive.
How serious it was

517
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,650
after we loaded a tanks
onto the rail cars.

518
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,660
She go to the rail,
head of marrying would just,

519
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,060
I don't know,
the 20 miles,

520
00:38:26,061 --> 00:38:30,020
25 miles from Busan where
we offloaded the tanks.

521
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,940
He said where I first
went into combat in Korea.

522
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,410
Eh,
I don't really know that.

523
00:38:41,411 --> 00:38:46,320
We thought how serious it was.
It got you.

524
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,070
I got the impression

525
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,690
several days later when the
division assistant division
commander called all the

526
00:38:56,891 --> 00:38:59,800
hospitals in the singer
NGLs together in a,

527
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,660
in a place and he's dead men.
We live or die here.

528
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:11,180
And I've thought to myself, what in the
hell did I get myself into here? Yeah.

529
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,200
But that's, that's what
it was. I mean, we would,

530
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,620
I it, you know, in hindsight, yeah.

531
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,500
I have read books about
what happened in Korea

532
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,920
and we really didn't understand that.

533
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,330
I mean we were just
there doing a job and uh,

534
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,130
I don't think we really understood
how perilous the situation was.

535
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,270
And at any point while you were there,

536
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,840
did you understand the
peril of the situation to,

537
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:50,841
or would you just in your particular
battles day by day trying to hold the line

538
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:53,590
where you were at?
Didn't it?

539
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,780
Was the communications is kind of not
effective enough to really for you to

540
00:39:57,781 --> 00:39:59,300
understand the bigger picture?
We,

541
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,850
we had no idea what the bigger
picture was. I mean honest to God,

542
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:09,340
we were just doing our
job and as I said earlier,

543
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,530
watching these waves of
people come across it. Yeah.

544
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,201
Knack.

545
00:40:15,201 --> 00:40:20,201
John River will never ever
go away from my memory.

546
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,390
I mean people were just coming,
coming, coming and all we were doing,

547
00:40:25,391 --> 00:40:26,350
it was shooting,
shooting,

548
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:30,400
shooting and neighbor
just keep coming and uh,

549
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:33,960
yeah,

550
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,490
we managed to hold the line
and they didn't penetrate.

551
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,260
So No,

552
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:47,820
the answer is we didn't
understand this as a situation

553
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,693
as your,

554
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,170
were you holding the line
specifically you guys,

555
00:40:53,171 --> 00:40:55,420
you are holding the line on that river.
Yes.

556
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,540
And so they were going to have to try
and cross that river to get through the

557
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:03,040
line. When they swimming. Where are they
taking boats with? What were they doing?

558
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,773
They were waiting.

559
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,700
It was, it wasn't that, it wasn't
it, it was pretty wide river,

560
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:14,690
but it wasn't that deep. So they
were able to wade across, uh,

561
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,370
yeah. And they'd be just
keep coming. I mean,

562
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,170
and then how long,
how long did that particular,

563
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:26,030
how long were you under intense
waves of attacks like that?

564
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:29,030
It was like a tone. Was it like
20 days or something of the whole,

565
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,930
the whole thing I think lasted, I
dunno, 20 days or something. That was,

566
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:33,783
was going to say,

567
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,200
I,
I don't know,

568
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,420
it seemed like forever,

569
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,840
but I think it was probably
over and two or three,

570
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,970
a couple of weeks.
Uh,

571
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,980
my first
involvement,

572
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:05,220
we've got off the tanks off the flat car
and then we rolled into action and my,

573
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:12,230
uh, uh, lead tank

574
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,150
right in front of my very eyes exploded.

575
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:25,550
We'll never forget watching the tank
commander go sailing out into the ditch to

576
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,860
the right and the tank exploding.

577
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,830
We are rounded a curve
and unbeknownst to us,

578
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,710
never to Russian tanks,
man by Koreans

579
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,320
up just draw.

580
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:48,120
And they fired at this
tank and we had him,

581
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,420
my Virginia was in force,
uh,

582
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:55,500
Sherman tanks and gas

583
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,270
engines and they fired him.

584
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,060
They fired into the gas tank
is Hillel thing exploded.

585
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,530
And so my first day in Korea combat

586
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,200
one tank destroyed
fire people,

587
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,230
which at that time tank had a crew of
five or all four of them were killed in

588
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:25,400
the tank to tank commander.
It was back in the United States.

589
00:43:25,401 --> 00:43:28,740
And less than two weeks after we
left over three weeks after we left.

590
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:33,450
And that was my first
day in combat in Korea.

591
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,853
And uh,

592
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:41,040
so from then on we got into the,

593
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,840
the perimeter and spent a couple
of weeks there. I don't know.

594
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:50,000
I don't, I don't remember. Uh,

595
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,010
you read earlier by the citation,
it was September 19th,

596
00:43:56,011 --> 00:43:59,620
which when I was one of the reason, I
know that was September 19th. So if,

597
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,020
because you,
what you read,

598
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,810
I didn't remember what exact
data dates it was. Yeah.

599
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:11,990
Cause it wasn't too long after that
happened that we had to Inchon landing and

600
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:16,950
everything broke out and
we were heading north.

601
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,160
So it was a couple of weeks.
I don't know.

602
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,600
When you were from a leadership
perspective dealing with losing guys in

603
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:30,440
comparison to when you were in World
War II and you weren't necessarily in

604
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:34,020
command of, but you're seeing people get
wounded, you're seeing people get killed.

605
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,420
What was your mindset? What
was your perspective? Um,

606
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,890
as a leader when guys
were getting wounded,

607
00:44:41,891 --> 00:44:44,800
guys were getting killed and then
you had a bunch of, you know,

608
00:44:44,801 --> 00:44:47,060
you were saying that your sergeant,
you,

609
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:51,520
they felt they were lucky to have someone
that had been in combat before and

610
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:54,340
then all of a sudden I know that they
were looking to you saying, okay,

611
00:44:54,341 --> 00:44:56,050
well what do we do now,
boss?

612
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:01,340
Yeah. Well one thing about, uh,

613
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:02,660
in a tank,

614
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:09,430
the grooves are inside the tank and as
with the radio you could direct people to

615
00:45:11,901 --> 00:45:14,320
do this and do that.
Uh,

616
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,500
and so I just told them what they
should be doing and they did it.

617
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:24,540
I mean, I didn't, uh,

618
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,270
leadership is just telling people

619
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,720
what they should do and they're trained
to do it and they do it. I mean, uh,

620
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,470
I, I learned, actually I learned,

621
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,970
I talked to a grownup on Iowa leadership.

622
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,680
I didn't even know what that was.

623
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,060
I learned what leadership
was all about at West Point.

624
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,220
And that's the major difference.

625
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,850
When I was in World War Two,

626
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,490
I was just taking care of myself.

627
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:09,590
I wasn't really too concerned
about the other guy,

628
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:13,160
what was going on.
We were all just doing our job.

629
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,820
That's very different when
you're in a combat situation. Uh,

630
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,610
and you got people
depending on each other.

631
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:30,880
And we were all dependent upon each other
when we're in a tank platoon and each

632
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:37,400
of us were trained to do a
job and they did it. I mean,

633
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,590
one of the,
one of the things my petunias

634
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,150
didn't exist prior, I
mean, on paper it existed.

635
00:46:49,151 --> 00:46:50,770
It didn't exist physically.

636
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,930
So what happened when we were activated,

637
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,240
the guard house was emptied out and
we got replacements from Fort Hood,

638
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,280
Texas.
And that was my platoon.

639
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:10,080
One of the best soldiers in my platoon
was my loader who had spent most of his

640
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:14,000
army career in the guard house.

641
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,520
But you can't believe what a great
soldier wasn't. Combat. I mean,

642
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:23,650
cause he knew what he was doing and
he was trained to do it and he did it.

643
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,990
I will never forget those young men.
I mean,

644
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,793
I'm still in

645
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,260
email contact with my former gunner,

646
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,430
who's now retired as a
command sergeant major,

647
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:42,770
but he still calls me lieutenant

648
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,600
does. He was, he kept my ass on a
trouble, I'll tell you that. Right?

649
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,100
I mean he,

650
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,630
he taught me more about how to be a
platoon leader than anybody will ever

651
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,300
understand.
And

652
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,370
I guess the leadership training I had
at west point combined with what these

653
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:12,121
young member teaching me allowed
me to become pretty effective.

654
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:16,780
A leader throughout,
not just my military career,

655
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:20,680
but my commercial career too. I, I,

656
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:25,710
I'm a strong believer in that leadership
works not just in the military but in

657
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,840
commercial business.

658
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:34,840
Yeah.
You talked about leadership inside a tank.

659
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,190
What did you see in and how did you see
what was going on that got you to get

660
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,820
out of that tank and tell you that you
needed to get out of that vehicle and

661
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:43,320
start driving

662
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,250
and what's going on in the ground?

663
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,890
I wish I knew the answer to that.
I mean it just did it. I made,

664
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,650
I knew something had to be done and

665
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,500
my radio communications with these
guys on the ground wasn't working.

666
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:09,840
So you've got to, you got to communicate.

667
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,260
And the only way you can communicate
if the radio isn't working,

668
00:49:13,261 --> 00:49:14,750
you've got to get your butt off the,

669
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:20,030
off the tank down there so you can
talk to these guys because they weren't

670
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:21,390
trying to talk to me.

671
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:25,230
I was trying to talk to them and get them
figuring out what the hell they should

672
00:49:25,231 --> 00:49:28,500
be doing.
So I just did it.

673
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:31,620
I don't know what prompted me to do it.

674
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,790
It's a good question

675
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,410
cause I have no idea. You know, I talk
about that sometimes I talk about, uh,

676
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:45,490
as a leader, being able to
identify what I would call it.

677
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:50,610
I just called the void of leadership and
it's very easy to see when you are used

678
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:55,150
to seeing leadership filling the void.
When you see a void of leadership,

679
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,830
if you're aware to look for it,

680
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,190
it's really easy to see when it's
there and you go, wait a second,

681
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,870
someone needs to step
in here and take charge.

682
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:05,860
And so you had that instinct of hey,
there's a void of leadership here.

683
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,780
I got to do something and here we go.
That's right.

684
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,610
As much as you said to yourself at one
point I'm going to be inside that tank

685
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:16,150
and then the damn time you needed
the tank you got out of it.

686
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,410
Well in hindsight he had to do
what you had to do, I will say.

687
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:27,020
And then when, what, once you
guys held the line and you,

688
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,760
it's funny because I use that
expression a lot just talking about,

689
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:32,311
you know,

690
00:50:32,311 --> 00:50:35,450
a holding your line with your personal
discipline and holding the line with your,

691
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:39,860
your subordinates.
And we use it metaphorically.

692
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,980
And it's incredible to see here and talk
to you about actually literally holding

693
00:50:46,371 --> 00:50:47,204
the line

694
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:53,000
when you guys got done holding the
line and you had defeated that,

695
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:57,770
that onslaught from, from the North
Koreans. What was the next phase?

696
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,130
Move out and move north.
And we,

697
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:13,200
the first weeks we moved four or five
miles at the most [inaudible] we moved

698
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:19,300
hundreds of miles and I remember

699
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:27,390
going as fast as we could north to marry
up with the guys who invaded it inches.

700
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:34,450
And we just kept going.
I mean,

701
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,653
I,

702
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:45,190
I don't remember how many opportunities
we had to really get into combat.

703
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,973
Uh,

704
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,520
after we cleared the Pusan perimeter
until after we got Dorth of sill.

705
00:51:55,550 --> 00:52:00,530
I mean, we, uh, the invading army,

706
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,420
the invasion force, uh,
invaded it pretty well,

707
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:07,280
cleared all that stuff away.

708
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,670
And so the city of Seoul was open when we,

709
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,010
we went right through it and

710
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,460
we kept going north.
Uh,

711
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:24,040
the enemy was retreating pretty fast and
we were just going as fast as we could

712
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:29,030
drive enough to roads
in the, uh, in fact, uh,

713
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:35,300
our unit got almost the Yellow River,
uh,

714
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:39,690
which is what about the time
they decided the take the,

715
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:42,530
take the staff out of my butt.

716
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,470
So I was sent back to the
hospital ship and in the heart

717
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,630
that's when you got shrapnel was when you
were up by the, by the Yalu River? No,

718
00:52:50,631 --> 00:52:52,670
no. That's all that had
already. That's right.

719
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:54,710
That had happened earlier
and now it's coming back.

720
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,390
The staff was working,
no.

721
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,140
One of the things you got to remember
is this piece of metal is in my,

722
00:53:07,081 --> 00:53:11,280
but now in a tank,
the tank commander sits,

723
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:13,860
has a little thing,
just cities,

724
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:17,460
but on while he's riding
around in the turret,

725
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:21,660
well you don't do that when you have
a piece of metal working his way out.

726
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:24,660
It is painful to say the least.

727
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,830
And so I couldn't hardly
wait for that to happen,

728
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:32,760
but they wouldn't let me go back to the
hospital until it got reasonably close

729
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:36,810
to the surface.
So when it got close to the surface,

730
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:42,110
they evacuated me and it was in November
of 1950 that they sent me back to the

731
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:45,384
hospital ship.

732
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,400
And then, then I think you covered
this, but then you got done,

733
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,180
the metal comes out and then you go
back again cause you're trying to,

734
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:57,090
you're thinking here to get
home by Christmas if you
can get back to your unit.

735
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,990
And I, I got back to the unit eventually,
but I didn't get home by Chrysalis.

736
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,770
In fact, they, uh, by that,

737
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:09,030
by the time I got back to the unit,
we were the second division.

738
00:54:09,031 --> 00:54:12,380
It had already moved back south,
uh,

739
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,470
almost to the, um, the
Han River. And so I've,

740
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:24,050
I've found the unit again somewhere
south of somewhat north of the Han River,

741
00:54:25,171 --> 00:54:29,250
but still we were still in North Korea,

742
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:32,790
but it was the south part of North Korea.

743
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,280
And were you in a situ?
W did you guys get dug in?

744
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:39,050
Because I know part of
the Korean War was like,

745
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:41,450
they dug in and it was
almost like trench warfare.

746
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:45,440
Did you enter that phase or were you
still guys still moving north and south?

747
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:45,850
Yep,

748
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:50,120
we do. Uh, as tanks we never dug in.

749
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:54,970
Now later on,
uh,

750
00:54:55,530 --> 00:55:00,530
hang tin line stabilize pretty much
around the 38th parallel and there's a lot

751
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:01,874
of

752
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,520
digging in a defensive positions as well.
Uh,

753
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:11,660
but that was more infantry,
not not the tanks.

754
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:15,110
So how did you, how did
you end up, what was the,

755
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,540
what was the last phase of
you being over there like and,

756
00:55:17,541 --> 00:55:20,610
and what ended up bringing
you back to the states?

757
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:22,900
Uh,
well,

758
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:32,740
the line sort of stabilized around the
38th parallel that we would go forward

759
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,380
and then we come back. We would
go forward, come back, uh,

760
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:47,230
oftentimes, uh, the,

761
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:52,630
we would
do patrolling I guess is the right word,

762
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,420
patrolling and forced

763
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,800
a tank company with an f to company
attached ratting on the tanks would blast

764
00:56:03,101 --> 00:56:08,050
forward, uh, to some enemy position, uh,

765
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:12,700
it into a firefight,
take the ground,

766
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:16,120
and then we'd move back again.

767
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,980
We were just going back and forth,
uh,

768
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:23,060
around that so-called, uh, uh,

769
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:29,200
now turned out to be the 38th parallel.
But it was generally that sector.

770
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,220
Uh,
uh,

771
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,140
oftentimes the infantry would

772
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,680
get into a lot more heavy
firefights and the tanks would,

773
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:48,570
uh, I spent a lot of time
supporting infantry. Uh,

774
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,090
tax was my tank guns,

775
00:56:51,390 --> 00:56:55,850
machine guns covering their
advancements forward. But uh,

776
00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:00,390
dug in, no, we never, their
tanks for never dug in.

777
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,030
And then how long did that last?
For what, how long did you,

778
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,320
was your unit deployed over there
and wasn't the whole unit that,

779
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,420
that ended up going home?

780
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,280
No, no, at, uh,

781
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:18,910
at a certain point decided at people who
had been there a year would come home

782
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,460
and we started a rotation and,
uh,

783
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:27,230
I was one of the first ones
to rotate out of my unit

784
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:33,910
because I had some decorations and because
I'd been there a year and et Cetera,

785
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,490
I had a lot of points. And so, uh,

786
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,360
I was sent back,
I guess,

787
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,423
uh,

788
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:52,210
I got back to the United
States Labor Day of 1951,

789
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,100
so I was evacuated.

790
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,730
The word evacuated is probably not the
right word. We just shipped back home.

791
00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:03,723
Yeah.

792
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:09,090
And then so you get back home, you know
where you are coming home from Korea,

793
00:58:09,091 --> 00:58:13,050
it's obviously you at least experienced
some pretty intense stuff. And you know,

794
00:58:13,051 --> 00:58:14,430
you hear a lot of times,

795
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:18,240
especially nowadays with guys coming
home from Iraq and Afghanistan with guys

796
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,060
struggling to readapt to,

797
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:24,760
to life back in America.

798
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,960
And I think it's a little bit different
because when you came home you were

799
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:32,650
still in the army. And I think that's
the best thing for veterans. You know,

800
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:33,221
if you're still in,

801
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:36,010
I think the veterans that have the
hardest time are veterans that get out and

802
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:38,500
then all of a sudden the Brotherhood
that they are used to is gone.

803
00:58:38,501 --> 00:58:41,680
And the mission that they're
used to is gone. But is that,

804
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,640
is that what you experienced
and you came home and you,

805
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:48,250
you still had your mission of
moving forward in the army?

806
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:49,560
Yes.
I mean,

807
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,670
I had no feeling of not being appreciated.

808
00:58:57,090 --> 00:59:01,890
I mean, uh, obviously I,
uh, when I came back, I

809
00:59:03,690 --> 00:59:05,690
came back, uh, uh,

810
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:10,650
I had a daughter born while I was in
Korea, scaring the hell out of me.

811
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,870
I mean, I, I would have,
I still remember this

812
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:21,500
four month old child I
held for the first time,

813
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,300
first time I've ever held any buddy
that size scared the hell out of me.

814
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,483
It would be,

815
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:30,770
I was more scared about death and a
lot of the things to happen to me.

816
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,820
But anyway, I came
back, went to Fort Knox,

817
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:41,150
uh, when they sent me now they sent me
to school, learn to be a platoon leader.

818
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:45,580
And so, and then they, uh,

819
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:50,050
asked me if I wanted to stay there
at Fort Knox and run an officer,

820
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:53,240
candy company.
And I did.

821
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,630
And so we spent several years running
and Asta Candy Company and then,

822
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:01,083
uh,

823
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,900
they decided they didn't need it any more
officer candidate school at Fort Knox.

824
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,500
So they closed that down.

825
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:15,130
And I got selected to be
an aid to a John Waters.

826
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:23,170
John Waters does with General
Patton's son in law and a

827
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,160
wonderful experience.
Learned a lot

828
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:34,640
from a real gentleman. Uh, he was, uh, he,

829
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:38,980
he,
he was a bigger general that time became,

830
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,880
say two stars, but he eventually
retired as a four star general.

831
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,240
And, uh, but he taught me a lot about

832
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:52,460
being a, being an officer. Uh,

833
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,990
that's much about leadership,
but being an officer and a gentleman,

834
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,860
he was a outstanding
person.

835
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:06,470
And, uh, I learned from him.

836
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:08,903
I mean,

837
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,070
you know, when you, when
you're working as an aide,

838
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,710
you get pretty close to
somebody and, uh, uh,

839
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:23,890
always feel very fortunate that I
was able to be his aid and learn.

840
01:01:25,060 --> 01:01:28,720
I don't know if you know,
he's the one in the movie,

841
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:32,540
but General Patents and then, uh, uh,

842
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,860
troops into rescue somebody
in a prisoner of war camp.

843
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:41,130
He was the one who was into prisoner
of war camp and he was wounded very

844
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,560
seriously there. But I mean, and uh,

845
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:49,480
it was quite a experience working
for him for several years.

846
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:53,200
That was multiple years, pardon?
Multiple years as an aide.

847
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:57,960
I vent a two and a half
years has, is eight. So,

848
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:02,770
and then as he went on to his assignments,

849
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:05,260
I went onto my assignments and,
uh,

850
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:10,270
one of the experiences I had,
uh,

851
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,150
in 1956,
56,

852
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:20,010
I was a company commander,
a chain

853
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:24,320
company, and [inaudible]
Germany said, yeah.

854
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:29,780
And he at that time was running the
military assistance command in Yugoslavia

855
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,540
and he decided to come up and visit me.

856
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,870
Now here's the major general,

857
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:42,650
and he's coming to visit this
captain and bomb holder Germany.

858
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:43,913
And it was,

859
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,450
you can't believe all the
other stuff that went on,

860
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:56,520
what the hell's he general coming to
see you for it, et Cetera, et cetera.

861
01:02:56,521 --> 01:03:00,840
But anyway, we, we got
through all that. But, uh, he,

862
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:01,973
he was,
uh,

863
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:07,130
he didn't come to visit me in Vietnam
when he was Pacific commander, but, uh,

864
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:11,940
he was, uh, he took care of
watching what I was doing.

865
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,270
So it was,
it was an experience,

866
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,890
wonderful experience and a great
learning experience to be his aid.

867
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:21,510
Yeah.
I was actually an aid to,

868
01:03:21,511 --> 01:03:25,380
for the admiral that was in charge of
all the seals and it was a very similar

869
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:27,120
situation for me.
It was a great guy.

870
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:30,510
And I learned aton about,

871
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,330
about the way the whole big machine work,

872
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,580
which you have no idea when
you're a young Hulu Danny,

873
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:38,710
you have no idea what's going
on behind the scenes. And,

874
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:41,310
and I definitely got to
learn a lot about that.

875
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,860
And the same thing you just talked about,
you know,

876
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:47,370
I had just had a great
relationship with them and, and uh,

877
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:52,170
he took care of me and my guys on
many occasions, uh, which was great.

878
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,340
And since he was the
admiral at one time we were,

879
01:03:56,490 --> 01:04:01,490
he was a surfer and I was organizing a
trip for us to go to Hawaii and we were

880
01:04:02,641 --> 01:04:05,280
going to see some of the seals
that were stationed out in Hawaii.

881
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:09,450
And the big thing I had to do is get
organized so that when we got picked up at

882
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:10,080
the airport,

883
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:15,080
there were surfboards in the vehicles
ready to take us directly to surfing.

884
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:19,650
As soon as we showed up the safe no,
people say, what do you want these sexy,

885
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:23,220
you just get the surf boards ready.
That's what you need to do for the boss.

886
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:29,190
Um, and then, so you did that, you end up,

887
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:33,630
you end up, so 56, you're over,
you're a company commander.

888
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,600
And what happens in between then and,

889
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:41,690
and then, uh, I was,

890
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,610
um,
a unit,

891
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,600
second harmed second armored
division and at that time,

892
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:52,920
um, and 57, uh,

893
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:57,500
they had something they were going
to rotate the fourth division,

894
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,710
which Fourth Armored Division,
which I had been at Fort Hood.

895
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:06,220
They rotate it to Germany in the second
armored division to go to rotate back to

896
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:10,220
port hood.
However,

897
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:15,221
I'd only been in country a little over
a year and I wasn't eligible to rotate

898
01:05:16,431 --> 01:05:18,340
back.
So they

899
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:20,680
uh, uh, in her

900
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:26,350
decision for those of
us who weren't eligible,

901
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:27,940
had to be reassigned.

902
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:32,590
And I was reassigned to be at the
secretary of the general staff.

903
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:36,940
It Heidelberg,
which is US Army Europe.

904
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,560
So non going from being a company
commander in bomb holder Germany,

905
01:05:41,561 --> 01:05:43,120
which is the end of the line,

906
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:47,740
all the way to the very
senior army command in Europe.

907
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:53,730
And I'm working now for a four star
general in his general staff organization.

908
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,190
And I had,
uh,

909
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:03,310
once again a chance to go from learning,

910
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,750
knowing what's going on down
here to watching what's going on,

911
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:11,750
very senior leadership. And, uh, it was,

912
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:16,180
it another opportunity,
uh, for a year and a half.

913
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:20,260
I had that job and it was just
a great experience learning

914
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,280
if you would the other
extreme of where you'd been.

915
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,060
That was my,
and then

916
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:34,650
rotated back to the United States
and 59 to become a math professor.

917
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:41,131
It was point would I spent four years
being a math professor and then went to

918
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:48,460
the Army Command General Staff
College at Fort Leavenworth.

919
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:54,390
And then the army decided that
they needed to have people

920
01:06:57,310 --> 01:07:00,250
contracting McNamara's Whiz kids

921
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:03,910
in.
So

922
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,650
they figured that somebody had been
teaching math, probably could not.

923
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:15,380
So they sent me the University
of Michigan to get a degree in,

924
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:23,970
which turned out to be operations
research. But the army sent me to be,

925
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,990
get a degree in automatic data processing,

926
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,790
which they didn't have such a
thing at Michigan. But uh, Eh,

927
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,200
closest thing to it was industrial
engineering operations research.

928
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,520
So I spent two years
there getting a degree.

929
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:45,820
And then I rather than go back to
the Pentagon for utilization tour,

930
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:48,800
I volunteered to go to Vietnam.
So I,

931
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,593
and uh,

932
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,800
when you say that they will,

933
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:55,710
the army knew that they needed
someone to counteract the whiz kids.

934
01:07:55,711 --> 01:07:57,490
And I've talked about the Whiz kids at,

935
01:07:57,510 --> 01:08:01,350
I've covered them somewhat because the,

936
01:08:01,351 --> 01:08:04,500
a lot of the people operational
on the ground said, hey, these,

937
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,920
these statistics that you're coming up
with don't take into account the human

938
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,690
aspect of these kind of,
this conflict in Vietnam.

939
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:15,560
So was that something that was felt and,

940
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:19,040
and understood inside the army at
that time? I mean, clearly it was,

941
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,850
yes.

942
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:24,770
That's the whole idea was to take somebody
who knew something about the army and

943
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:29,730
give him some education to these kids.

944
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:32,180
So called kids had,
uh,

945
01:08:32,730 --> 01:08:35,820
and statistical analysis
and all that stuff.

946
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:40,760
And so to be the other part of the,

947
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,570
of the,
of the board,

948
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,980
and that was to be my utilization tour.

949
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:49,013
So

950
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:52,280
there's a great example of that
and it's, it's the battle. The,

951
01:08:52,281 --> 01:08:56,210
I drank valley and um,
Colonel Moore talks about it,

952
01:08:56,630 --> 01:09:00,020
the fact that the,
what the whiz kids basically said,

953
01:09:00,610 --> 01:09:02,810
well one of the things that they said was,
okay,

954
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,310
we can kill 170,
uh,

955
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:11,330
Vietnamese soldiers for every
one of ours that, that they kill.

956
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:15,650
So statistically we'll just keep running
that problem over and over again and

957
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:20,630
we'll end up winning. And I always point
out and which, which everyone points out,

958
01:09:20,631 --> 01:09:24,950
and I'm sure you had pointed out as well
as what they didn't take into account

959
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:27,230
is the fact that number one,

960
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:32,910
170 Vietnamese killed to the Vietnamese
was not as big of a deal as we thought

961
01:09:34,251 --> 01:09:35,084
it would be.

962
01:09:35,150 --> 01:09:40,150
And we also didn't take into account that
one American dead is a lot bigger than

963
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:45,020
the statisticians thought it
would be to us. And that's just a,

964
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:49,340
it's a huge tragedy to go
into that situation like that.

965
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:51,370
Well,
in fact,

966
01:09:51,371 --> 01:09:56,371
I many times thought a body count was
the dumbest thing we've ever come up with

967
01:09:59,260 --> 01:10:02,680
is a measure of success in combat.

968
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:08,910
And I said that I don't know how many
times and I am still convinced that was

969
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:16,180
the dumbest thing we've
done over the time.

970
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:21,660
And I was there participating
in it and it was terrible.

971
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,580
Yeah. So let's, let's
go to Vietnam. So you,

972
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:30,180
you volunteered for Vietnam in 1966 or 65.

973
01:10:30,181 --> 01:10:33,690
66. Okay. And did he, do
they automatically say, okay,

974
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:35,970
well you're a lieutenant colonel,
that means you're going to,

975
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,800
you're going to take over
a squadron or a battalion.

976
01:10:38,110 --> 01:10:43,060
Oh, shit was the case.
In fact, the fact that

977
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:50,120
give him the army mark credit and just
do now a nation along with everybody

978
01:10:52,031 --> 01:10:52,660
else.

979
01:10:52,660 --> 01:10:57,660
I was a lieutenant colonel arrived in
country and I was assigned initially to be

980
01:10:58,481 --> 01:11:03,481
the executive officer of the
Combat Operation Center of Mac v,

981
01:11:05,711 --> 01:11:09,400
which is the headquarters
of all in the company.

982
01:11:09,401 --> 01:11:14,400
Operation Center was Westmoreland's,
uh, operation center.

983
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:15,623
And uh,

984
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:20,130
it was run by a Marine Brigadier
General Bill Jones by name.

985
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,210
Uh, and uh, it was a great man. I mean,

986
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:28,500
and I was his exact and uh, and we, uh,

987
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:34,380
caught, ran the war, so to speak
the word. We as a very loose term

988
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,560
from the coc and uh,

989
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:46,350
that was, uh, headquarters
right there in Saigon.

990
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:51,540
And, uh, it was a cushy job.

991
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:56,550
I mean, that'd be, went to
work on a regular hourly basis.

992
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,200
I used to go in at night once in a while
because President Johnson was going to

993
01:12:01,201 --> 01:12:06,201
talk to some of the action officers
trying to find out what was happening to

994
01:12:06,421 --> 01:12:08,430
these patrols that we were sending out.

995
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,980
That's a serious sign of Micromanagement,
Huh? Well, let me tell you,

996
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,460
it was micromanagement of the first order.
And I sought,

997
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:23,150
absolutely sought an in happening
more often than I care to remember.

998
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,653
And,

999
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:30,440
but I had one of the evenings I
met one of my former colleagues,

1000
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:34,380
uh,

1001
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:39,310
armor who was commanding the
first and the fourth Carrea,

1002
01:12:39,340 --> 01:12:40,800
the first infantry division.

1003
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:46,440
And he told me he was going
to rotate home in December.

1004
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:51,060
I said, can I get that job?
He said, he take me up.

1005
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:55,260
And he introduced me to General
Depue who was division commander.

1006
01:12:56,100 --> 01:12:58,710
And I went up and I passed the test.

1007
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:02,940
He'd have to know
general the Pew. And, uh,

1008
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:08,790
he was a no nonsense
guy. Uh, he, he would,

1009
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:12,080
people thought I was
crazy because general,

1010
01:13:12,081 --> 01:13:17,070
the pew was relieving Battalion Commanders
for incompetence, right and left.

1011
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:22,500
And I figured, you know, if
you go up and do your job,

1012
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,690
you're going to be okay.
It went up

1013
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:31,310
and Gerald appeal energies interviewed
me and general Hollins worked,

1014
01:13:31,581 --> 01:13:35,950
yet it was the assistant division
commander and Hollingsworth in Busia. No,

1015
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:39,570
Kaverman I mean, uh, and he couldn't,

1016
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:44,610
the two of the two of them
passed on me said it was okay.

1017
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:50,090
And so I got reassigned to command
of the first and fourth Camry,

1018
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:54,960
uh,
in December of 1966,

1019
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,120
which was, uh, a plum job. That was,

1020
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:06,150
it was not only a plum outfit,
but it general,

1021
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,030
the pew used to Calvary Squadron.

1022
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:13,900
Like it should be used many times later.

1023
01:14:14,260 --> 01:14:19,260
My successors who are all
not as lucky as I was.

1024
01:14:19,810 --> 01:14:21,430
I mean,
I was able to

1025
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:27,120
fight my unit has a unit. I had, uh,

1026
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,660
uh,
three ground troops.

1027
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:34,590
One cal,

1028
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:40,060
Amina d troop was a helicopter school.

1029
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:45,360
A troop had 31 helicopters in it and I
had division commander would assign a big

1030
01:14:49,491 --> 01:14:53,440
company here, the tank battalion
that was assigned to my unit.

1031
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:56,740
And then since there wasn't
any real enemy aircraft,

1032
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:02,340
he assigned the several of the batteries
of the any aircraft unit to my unit.

1033
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:07,090
So I had, uh, a unit

1034
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:12,930
unparalleled in history because general,

1035
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:17,931
the pew believed the calvary was supposed
to go find the enemy and keep them

1036
01:15:18,101 --> 01:15:19,750
there until he's an
infantry could show up.

1037
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:24,100
And we did it more often than not in

1038
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:30,060
one of the stories I tell people.
Aye.

1039
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,450
Aye.
Aye.

1040
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:35,470
I'm self-styled King of the
Michelin Rubber Plantation,

1041
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:41,560
which is, you know, 70
square miles of trees. And

1042
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:48,460
historically there's little
communities of workers throughout the,

1043
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,820
the, this place. And

1044
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:58,480
it became these little towns
became havens for the North Korea,

1045
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:03,390
for the North Coast, north
Vietnamese. And uh, uh,

1046
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:08,700
so we took it upon ourselves to evacuate
everybody out of the little villages to

1047
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:13,981
the perimeter of the plantation and then
took it upon ourselves to destroy the

1048
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:23,070
villages because the north Dorothy enemies
were coming in at night using these

1049
01:16:23,861 --> 01:16:27,160
places. In Shelly, our units.

1050
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:32,740
So we were destroying
all these little hamlets.

1051
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:34,300
In fact,

1052
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:39,300
I had an engineer company assigned to
me in one of the contest was between the

1053
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:44,200
captain who was the engineer
company commander in myself.

1054
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:49,440
I'd give her my chopper and he'd be
down on the ground and he was going to

1055
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:55,210
implode these village.
Now if he imploded them all,

1056
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:58,240
he won any of the villages.

1057
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,600
Buildings would still be standing.
I won.

1058
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:07,540
Now what did we win a beer
and more often than not I won.

1059
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,850
He didn't win.
He didn't lose many.

1060
01:17:10,851 --> 01:17:15,851
But we got some in the spring of 1967

1061
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:25,330
ambassador Ellsworth
bunker arrives in Vietnam.

1062
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,800
The first unit he wants to visit is mine.

1063
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:37,150
There is everybody is what in the world
of why did he pick this and why does he

1064
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:42,500
come to see you?
Well,

1065
01:17:42,501 --> 01:17:45,740
he gets out there and all the,
now he's got a four star general

1066
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:51,080
three star general and then
division commander, all wisdom,

1067
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:56,150
and they were out in the middle of
nowhere. I'm briefing to ambassador.

1068
01:17:58,010 --> 01:18:02,630
I get it most so many
savers. He says, colonel,

1069
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:08,980
I got more correspondence of my desk
from the French about what in the hell

1070
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:14,120
you're doing up here destroying their
village and all the people and causing all

1071
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:17,120
this commotion. What are you
doing and why you're doing it.

1072
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:23,540
And I explained to him that why we were
doing it because they disabilities were

1073
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:28,541
being havens for the north and they were
coming in and Shell and are killing our

1074
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:33,800
troops. And I've always
remembered him. See, colonel,

1075
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:37,790
he just keep doing what you're doing
and I'll take care of the French.

1076
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:42,110
And I said, cat machine. I mean,

1077
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:46,220
I still get emotional.
Was that that man,

1078
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:49,670
that gentleman understood
what the hell was going on.

1079
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:55,130
And here we talk about State Department
people not knowing what's going on.

1080
01:18:55,370 --> 01:19:00,110
He knew what was going on and he told
me to keep doing what I was doing and I

1081
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:00,944
did it.

1082
01:19:02,870 --> 01:19:07,870
But I will always remember
him is I think at the time,

1083
01:19:07,971 --> 01:19:09,050
I'm not sure this,

1084
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:13,320
he was either the oldest or next
oldest ambassador we ever had in,

1085
01:19:13,321 --> 01:19:17,280
in in the State Department. But he
goes out there trapping around in the,

1086
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:21,830
in the boonies with me.
And it was a rare experience.

1087
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:26,810
But anyway, it was a, it was
one of those days, you know,

1088
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:30,200
when you really think you counted.
Yeah.

1089
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:36,500
And he was, to me, that's leadership too.

1090
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,020
You know, he, he was, he knew
what the hell was going on and he,

1091
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:46,040
he was able to tell me to keep doing
what I was supposed to be doing. Yeah.

1092
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,200
He was,
he was a great man.

1093
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,460
So those operations,

1094
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:54,990
that was that the primary
type of operation that
you'd be doing is going into

1095
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,290
areas,
uh,

1096
01:19:56,490 --> 01:20:00,510
and basically disrupting
what the enemy was up to.

1097
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:05,790
Basically, we, the mission
was searching, destroy,

1098
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:11,040
and what we did was go find,

1099
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:15,560
try to find the enemy
and then destroy him. Uh,

1100
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:20,370
so in that,
in the Michelin Plantation,

1101
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:26,370
we thought the enemy was not there,

1102
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:31,680
but we spent, uh, there was
something called the iron triangle.

1103
01:20:32,190 --> 01:20:37,050
North of Saigon is about
30 miles north of Saigon.

1104
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:41,340
Uh, which of of our
operational area. And, uh,

1105
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,560
it was traditionally a haven for the,

1106
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:53,360
the north end or the whoever.

1107
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:56,190
Anyway,
the guys that were shooting at us,

1108
01:20:56,610 --> 01:21:01,610
and you never know whether the north
Vietnamese are there are constricted south

1109
01:21:03,331 --> 01:21:07,170
Vietnamese, but they all
look the same to me. And uh,

1110
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:11,220
they still do. I, I'm never in Korea.

1111
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,780
I couldn't tell the difference
between North Korea and South Korea.

1112
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,720
And I still could never
tell the difference.

1113
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:19,140
When you're south Vietnamese
and north Vietnamese, they, it,

1114
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,960
it maybe there's a way,
but I never figured it out.

1115
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:28,370
And so we just went in and constantly
we're searching and destroy and if we,

1116
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,840
if we find the enemy and strength,

1117
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:39,380
our job was to hold them there until
generally few and the could get his,

1118
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:40,110
uh,

1119
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:44,850
infantry into helicopters and bring
them in and really defeat the enemy.

1120
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,003
Uh,

1121
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:52,040
on occasion we got in more of a
firefight and we expected to be,

1122
01:21:52,411 --> 01:21:56,150
but we, we generally, uh,

1123
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,150
we're pretty good at finding them in.

1124
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:05,190
The tanks would roll right through this
forest and not the trees right down.

1125
01:22:05,191 --> 01:22:08,320
And it was,
it was no problem at all of it.

1126
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:12,740
And I was in my helicopter directing you,

1127
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:16,890
you could see in, you tell
the tanks where to go, uh,

1128
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:18,790
in the tanks and Avycaz,

1129
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:23,430
which were primarily what
the unit was all about.

1130
01:22:24,930 --> 01:22:28,710
And so we,
that was our job.

1131
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:33,740
Yeah. So often I read about units that
were over there that never, or very,

1132
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:38,570
very seldom would they see the enemy.
They would lose guys to sniper fire.

1133
01:22:38,571 --> 01:22:41,630
They'd lose guys to mortar fire,
they'd lose guys to booby traps.

1134
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:45,830
But very seldom would they see the enemy.
And you know,

1135
01:22:45,831 --> 01:22:47,330
obviously there's units that
are different than that,

1136
01:22:47,331 --> 01:22:51,290
but it sounded like you were able to
find the enemy on a fairly regular basis.

1137
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:55,870
Oh yes. Are they found us? Aye.

1138
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,710
Aye. Aye. Aye.

1139
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:00,220
You know,
who finds who is,

1140
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:04,540
is not sure there's an answer to that.
But yes,

1141
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,060
we more often that we got
in, we had contact, uh,

1142
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,250
uh, I had, uh,

1143
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:17,580
more than I would like
to remit casualties. Uh,

1144
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:23,280
which didn't happen because
they couldn't find the enemy.

1145
01:23:23,281 --> 01:23:26,010
I can tell you they could find us,
you know,

1146
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,590
and often remember,
uh,

1147
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:32,820
somebody a long time in
my goal in my career.

1148
01:23:32,821 --> 01:23:36,900
Tell me something about
reconnaissance by fire. And I,

1149
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:41,160
I remember with a tank you had a lot of
machine guns and you could do a lot of

1150
01:23:41,161 --> 01:23:46,161
reconnaissance by fire and in
trouble with Ricardo by fires.

1151
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,620
Yeah.

1152
01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:52,110
You never know whether
they see you or not.

1153
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,220
You just know there's somebody shooting
at you. Well that's good enough.

1154
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:02,130
That's good enough. We don't need any,
no other, he's aiming at you or not.

1155
01:24:04,850 --> 01:24:07,440
Uh, when you, uh,

1156
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:12,490
one of the things that also I talk
about and I've read a lot about is the

1157
01:24:13,251 --> 01:24:17,510
Vietnam war being very difficult from a
leadership perspective for some leaders

1158
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:22,070
more than others.
But because you had draftees and,

1159
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:26,030
and you had draftees, not just
draftees that got drafted in, okay,

1160
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:27,620
I'm going to go do my duty.
But draftees,

1161
01:24:27,621 --> 01:24:32,150
they got drafted that literally did not
believe in what was happening and barely

1162
01:24:32,151 --> 01:24:36,930
even believed in America as a country.
How much of that did,

1163
01:24:36,931 --> 01:24:39,710
did you see and what do you,
what was your,

1164
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:41,600
what was your leadership approach to those

1165
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,100
troops? I saw the zero of that. I mean,

1166
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:51,630
I don't know. I was just absolutely lucky.
I know I'm not that naive. I mean, uh,

1167
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:56,210
I'll tell you the last few guys have been
talking to and reading about this and,

1168
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,170
and there's something
that I've noticed a trend.

1169
01:24:58,171 --> 01:25:02,130
So have you heard the term millennials
about the new up and coming kids?

1170
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:05,000
I know what millennials, so
people complain about, you know,

1171
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:08,970
especially from a leadership perspective,
people talk to me about, well, you know,

1172
01:25:08,971 --> 01:25:10,530
I've got my company and
we've got these new,

1173
01:25:10,770 --> 01:25:14,220
these kids checking into millennials.
They're different, they're entitled,

1174
01:25:14,221 --> 01:25:18,750
they don't want to work as hard. And
I, I started thinking about my head,

1175
01:25:18,840 --> 01:25:22,980
well, basically you've got a workforce
that's a little bit different.

1176
01:25:23,340 --> 01:25:28,230
And this is very similar to the
draftees and Vietnam who had a different

1177
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:29,064
attitude.

1178
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:34,320
And what I've found from good
leaders is it didn't matter.

1179
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,050
It didn't matter that they had
draft these. As a matter of fact,

1180
01:25:37,051 --> 01:25:40,410
a general Ngukurr Yama who I just
talked about when I talked to,

1181
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,750
when I asked him about draftees,
he said,

1182
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,690
I didn't even know who was a
draftee and who was a lifer.

1183
01:25:45,691 --> 01:25:49,650
I couldn't tell the difference. And, and,
uh, Colonel Hackworth wrote in his book,

1184
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:54,540
he wrote, I love the draftees
because they were straight shooters.

1185
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,000
They didn't,
we weren't trying to protect their career.

1186
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:58,230
They tell you what they thought,

1187
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:00,780
and you could take their input and
you could do something good with it.

1188
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:04,130
Uh,
I've

1189
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,260
said all along,

1190
01:26:07,310 --> 01:26:12,310
the soldiers I served with in
three different wars got better.

1191
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:16,760
And they were all draftees.
I mean, I didn't never,

1192
01:26:16,761 --> 01:26:20,780
Sarah with an all volunteer outfit.
They were all,

1193
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,720
no matter where I was,
they were draftees.

1194
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:28,340
And they all did their job.
I mean,

1195
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:34,140
I've never had anybody tell me,
uh,

1196
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:38,240
wasn't their job. It wasn't, this
wasn't what they wanted to do. It was,

1197
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:39,493
they just did it.

1198
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:44,460
And I don't know this
leadership or I don't just,

1199
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,750
it just the way it was. And, uh,

1200
01:26:50,270 --> 01:26:53,120
they were all proud to be in our outfit.
I mean

1201
01:26:56,060 --> 01:27:00,110
now I'm sure other people later on.
I mean,

1202
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:04,110
I've heard of people later on in,
uh,

1203
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,290
in Vietnam having little
problems with drugs and all that.

1204
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,530
We didn't have any of
that. Now, fortunately,

1205
01:27:12,531 --> 01:27:14,930
I left in 1967,

1206
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:20,470
so I'm not sure how
things got worse perhaps.

1207
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:23,960
But, uh, I think, uh,

1208
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:28,830
drugs are an issue period.
Uh,

1209
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:32,300
but I don't know. I didn't have
any of that kind of a problem.

1210
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:37,670
And as I said earlier, I'm
not naive. Uh, I believe in,

1211
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:41,390
uh,
knowing exactly what's going on.

1212
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:45,440
What you find out is walk
around and talk to people.

1213
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:50,210
You don't sit in your tent
or in your helicopter.

1214
01:27:50,211 --> 01:27:53,120
You got to go down and talk to the guy
on the ground and find out what the

1215
01:27:53,121 --> 01:27:55,520
hell's going on. And that's, you know,

1216
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,520
there's a fellow who wrote a book,
his name was Peters,

1217
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:05,780
and this is many years later,
and he, he wrote the book,

1218
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:10,781
it's called management by walking around
and here's a guy made a fortune just

1219
01:28:11,121 --> 01:28:14,510
doing what I used to do.
It's,

1220
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,000
it's scary,
but it's true.

1221
01:28:20,030 --> 01:28:21,920
That's what leadership is all about,

1222
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:26,921
is find out what's going on and
then using it some common sense to

1223
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:34,460
tell people this is what you're supposed
to do, or give them some guidance.

1224
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:39,470
But I mean,
people who used to tell me,

1225
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:43,310
well, you know how to do things cause
you could order with people to do things.

1226
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:48,080
And I've seen,
let me tell you some ordering a guide,

1227
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:53,060
you get out of a tank to fix the track
when somebody shooting at you is not

1228
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:56,810
anybody willing to just do it.

1229
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:00,290
He's going to do it because he knows
if he don't get the track fixed,

1230
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:04,050
we're going to get ass killed. I
mean, we're going to get going.

1231
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:09,200
He's going to do it because that's his
job and that that may be leadership.

1232
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:11,303
But I'll tell ya,

1233
01:29:11,670 --> 01:29:15,540
it's discipline that comes
from people being trained,

1234
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:19,590
right and taught right and treated right.
You don't,

1235
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:23,760
if you don't treat people right,
they deserve to treat you wrong.

1236
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:29,550
And I'm a great believer in
treating people the right way.

1237
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:30,801
Well,
I,

1238
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:34,790
I'm just from hearing you
talk about treating people
the right way and listening

1239
01:29:34,791 --> 01:29:38,510
to people, you, you're,
you know, you say when,

1240
01:29:38,570 --> 01:29:40,940
when I told people to do
stuff, they did it well. Yeah.

1241
01:29:40,941 --> 01:29:43,460
That's because you treated them
well. You listen to him, you,

1242
01:29:43,530 --> 01:29:46,130
you had those relationships with your,
with your troops.

1243
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,380
And that's what makes people,
like you said,

1244
01:29:48,381 --> 01:29:51,290
when you got to have somebody that's
going to go to go out and fix the track

1245
01:29:51,291 --> 01:29:53,150
under fire,
well that's somebody that's,

1246
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:55,610
they're not going to do that just
because you ordered to do it.

1247
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:57,680
You better have some,
some relationships.

1248
01:29:57,681 --> 01:30:02,250
You better have treated them well
and they must understand why.

1249
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:05,180
The why on the mission as to
like, hey, why this is important.

1250
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:11,240
So when you,
when you look back at World War II,

1251
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:13,550
Korea,
Vietnam,

1252
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:18,740
I was from a tactical perspective,
actually maneuvering troops.

1253
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:23,330
Is there any big lessons that you
would think back of that you say,

1254
01:30:23,331 --> 01:30:26,810
this is something that I did consistently
or this is something that I would

1255
01:30:26,811 --> 01:30:29,480
never do because I knew
it would cause problems?

1256
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,083
Hmm.

1257
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:34,870
I can't think of anything.

1258
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:36,383
Ah,

1259
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:42,520
I'll go back to what I said earlier.
I've always believed,

1260
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,610
and maybe it's just from growing
up in Iowa, I don't know,

1261
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:51,090
just treat people like you'd like to
be treated yourself and it worked out.

1262
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:56,220
Uh,
I don't know.

1263
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,870
I told you about my first
sergeant called me Fifi

1264
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:07,300
which pissed me off quite frankly,
but uh,

1265
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:12,780
cause he was a guy who didn't treat
people like people like to be treated.

1266
01:31:14,110 --> 01:31:19,110
And I've always was amazed how much I
exalted and the fact when he got busted,

1267
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:26,790
I mean w we were in England on
the way over to continent and uh,

1268
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:31,300
he, he got busted for, I
don't know what reason,

1269
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:35,050
but he got busted back to
him. I mean, being a private,

1270
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,220
that's a big jump from first
sergeant founded via private.

1271
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:41,710
And I was happy

1272
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:46,730
because I didn't think this guy was,
he,

1273
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:51,140
he's also the guy when I took the test
to see what I could be smart enough to go

1274
01:31:51,141 --> 01:31:54,460
to the military academies said,
what the hell are you taking a test for?

1275
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:57,650
Therefore you're not smart
enough to go to the west point.

1276
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:03,790
Then I always would like to be able to
say to this guy, if I ever saw him again,

1277
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,970
I'm sure he's dead by now.
I told you so.

1278
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:10,600
But you know,
uh,

1279
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:15,820
if you don't treat people
like they should be treated,

1280
01:32:16,310 --> 01:32:16,820
they,

1281
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:21,370
you deserve to be
treated the opposite way.

1282
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:26,110
And, uh, I just have always practiced
or tried to practice it anyway.

1283
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:30,310
And uh,
so far it's been relatively successful.

1284
01:32:30,770 --> 01:32:35,590
So that's a huge underpinning
of leadership from,

1285
01:32:35,620 --> 01:32:38,200
from everything I've seen.
Everything I've ever read,

1286
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:39,820
every person I've ever talked to,

1287
01:32:40,990 --> 01:32:45,990
if you care about your people you care
about and you want to treat them well as

1288
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:50,560
human beings, that's the underpinning
that really makes leadership work.

1289
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:53,380
And it's a lot of times,
and you mentioned this earlier,

1290
01:32:53,381 --> 01:32:56,260
a lot of times from the
civilian side, they think, well,

1291
01:32:56,261 --> 01:32:58,690
in the military you can just order people
to do things and they'll just do it

1292
01:32:58,691 --> 01:33:01,570
because you're the boss.
And that's not true.

1293
01:33:01,571 --> 01:33:05,040
And it's actually when I got out of the
military and I started working in the

1294
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:08,980
civilian sector, I thought to myself,
well, if, well, if you didn't want, if,

1295
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:11,770
if you want somebody to do something and
they don't do it, you can just fire him.

1296
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:13,780
But that's not true either.
Because guess what,

1297
01:33:13,781 --> 01:33:15,310
you'll run out of people really quick.

1298
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:19,450
And so what you have to do is you have
to lead. That's what you have to do.

1299
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:20,650
One of those,

1300
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:25,390
the most core underpinnings of leadership
is really caring about the people that

1301
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:30,040
work for you. And I think
the more you care about them,
and I know for me, like I,

1302
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:34,960
I, I cared more about my
guys then I did about myself.

1303
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:38,500
I wanted to make sure that they were okay
and that things were going to go well

1304
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:42,790
for them. And that was always my
priority, my, my real priority.

1305
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:45,530
And Andy,

1306
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:50,940
I suppose someone that was
a very jaded might think,

1307
01:33:50,981 --> 01:33:53,950
well then you know, you're, you're
going to get passed over. You're not,

1308
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:56,470
things are going to work out good for you
because you're more worried about your

1309
01:33:56,471 --> 01:34:00,940
troops. And the opposite is
actually true and my career was,

1310
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:05,920
was it was beautiful and all I ever tried
to do is take care of the people that

1311
01:34:05,921 --> 01:34:07,040
work for me.
Okay.

1312
01:34:07,480 --> 01:34:10,780
Because that's the way
you get to be successful.

1313
01:34:12,450 --> 01:34:16,720
You know,
hiring people

1314
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:21,850
are working with people. You
know, in civilian sector,

1315
01:34:21,851 --> 01:34:24,580
you hire people in the village a week,

1316
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:27,830
whoever it was that
that was it get people.

1317
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:30,230
But I what he said,

1318
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:36,490
your job is to make the boss
successful and vice versa.

1319
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:38,900
The boss's job is to
make Dennis successful.

1320
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:44,440
And if you've worked at it works
out for both of you and to meet

1321
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:51,560
leadership,
you know,

1322
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:58,640
we talk about it, but it's easy if
you follow few basic principles,

1323
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,900
you don't have to have all
the stuff that goes mean.

1324
01:35:02,901 --> 01:35:04,610
People write books on leadership.

1325
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:09,290
You've probably written books on
leadership yourself. Yes indeed.

1326
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:14,390
But the fact of matter, there's some
basics and you just expand on it.

1327
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:19,520
You don't,
it isn't that magic.

1328
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:22,580
If you just follow a few basic principles.

1329
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:27,380
One of the things we talk about in
the book actually is simple, not easy,

1330
01:35:27,940 --> 01:35:32,830
because it is, there's the end. We say
that in our book as well as we're not,

1331
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,800
we didn't vent to me this,

1332
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:38,090
this is stuff that's been around and
there's no Eureka moments and we're not

1333
01:35:38,091 --> 01:35:41,300
claiming to have at
anything startlingly new.

1334
01:35:41,570 --> 01:35:44,380
This is fundamental stuff
that if you think about it,

1335
01:35:44,490 --> 01:35:46,430
some of it might be stuff
you already do as a leader.

1336
01:35:46,670 --> 01:35:50,390
Someone would be stuff that you know you
should do as a leader and just making

1337
01:35:50,391 --> 01:35:53,130
it clear for people to understand is,
is probably the,

1338
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:57,410
the only real benefit of the book itself.
It's like, okay, this is good stuff,

1339
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,970
but nothing,
no rocket science there.

1340
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:05,800
I didn't need to be a whiz kid to
write that book. I can find it.

1341
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:08,510
So did you,

1342
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:13,490
you mentioned earlier when we were not
recording that you actually ended up

1343
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:18,190
going back to Vietnam as and where
you a civilian at that time? Yes.

1344
01:36:22,110 --> 01:36:22,850
Okay.

1345
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:25,430
Well,
my wife and I like to travel.

1346
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:30,830
So we've traveled most of the
places in the world by now.

1347
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:36,280
And she wanted to go back and
see where I had been in Vietnam.

1348
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,710
And a nice,

1349
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:46,520
wasn't too sure about that. But
anyway, we had this opportunity.

1350
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:47,653
And uh,

1351
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:53,000
so we went back and I went to Hanoi,

1352
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:59,530
which was an experience and they go to
the Hanoi Hilton and seeing how they've

1353
01:37:01,791 --> 01:37:06,791
turned that into a propaganda
place and have still remember,

1354
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:11,090
seen his picture on the wall of uh,

1355
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:16,760
Senator Mccain and a couple of other guys,

1356
01:37:16,761 --> 01:37:17,930
I can't remember the names.

1357
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:22,610
Another one was what high
school classmate of mine,

1358
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:24,223
uh,

1359
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:31,110
but day by name who was an air
force or a retired colonel,

1360
01:37:31,830 --> 01:37:33,760
he got the medal of honor.
But anyway,

1361
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:38,920
in every showed them in these white
pants and white over shirt is if they've

1362
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:45,050
read up on a barbecue, you know, Indian,

1363
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:49,170
you know, everything you've
heard about this place was just,

1364
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:54,100
and they showed you some of the
cages that they had people in.

1365
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,070
We have had

1366
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:59,640
to get guests on the podcasts
that were in the Annoy Hilton.

1367
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:05,210
And one of them went back and was talking
us through that same propaganda went,

1368
01:38:07,831 --> 01:38:12,570
went back to them and only Hilton
as a civilian. And just the, uh,

1369
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:17,490
the feeling he had was,
was pretty strong.

1370
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:22,940
I can't imagine. I mean, uh, but you know,

1371
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:29,200
when I was there, I was just seeing
it from the propaganda and what they,

1372
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:31,330
cause it's,
it's a big

1373
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:37,430
tourist attraction apparently
for the Vietnamese. And, uh,

1374
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:42,930
so we obviously saw it
and knew what it was and,

1375
01:38:44,680 --> 01:38:45,820
and for what it was.

1376
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:51,640
And I hear all kinds of stories
about the people that were there,

1377
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:52,900
you know, but, uh,

1378
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:58,440
and then we went from there to
Denang and then down to Saigon.

1379
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:05,520
And, uh, I'd hired a, uh, uh,

1380
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:08,350
a car and a guide to take us up,

1381
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:14,020
back up to my own operational area
and Joe through the Michelin Rubber

1382
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:17,343
Plantation,

1383
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:22,510
which was sort of a fun experience to see.

1384
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:26,850
Now it's no longer, Michelin
is a state on, uh, uh,

1385
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:30,240
they took it over obviously
from the French, but, uh,

1386
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:35,680
it looks exactly the same. I mean,
trees are lined up, rubber trees,

1387
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:38,020
just rubber trees, rubber trees. And

1388
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:43,790
people are out there
working the trees. And, uh,

1389
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:47,620
I don't know if you know this,
this is an aside,

1390
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:51,700
you cannot burn a living rubber tree.

1391
01:39:52,150 --> 01:39:55,420
It won't burn.
And I've tried hard.

1392
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:58,390
I mean,
I had Flint,

1393
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:03,450
I have two flame throwers in my unit and
we tried hard to burn those trees down

1394
01:40:04,031 --> 01:40:07,600
on the sides of the road.
Doesn't work, doesn't work.

1395
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:11,530
And so anyway,
the,

1396
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:16,840
but we went back up to the old
operation or a in the same place.

1397
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,690
I was pretty close to her.
I got wounded

1398
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:26,740
when I was in Vietnam.

1399
01:40:27,250 --> 01:40:32,250
I was in my helicopter flying over this
river and I was pretty close to where

1400
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:37,050
that happened. I could do that because
I had to map coordinates of what I,

1401
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:38,740
where I had been wounded before.

1402
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:43,490
Otherwise I'd guarantee I'd never be
able to recognize the place. But, uh,

1403
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:48,250
but I, my old, uh, base camp,

1404
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:53,940
which was because I had helicopters of
where they had an airfield and now being

1405
01:40:54,371 --> 01:40:57,820
turned into a, a strip mall. So,

1406
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:02,500
so washed all that happening.
And uh, but it was a

1407
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:07,080
scene. Saigon again was, uh,

1408
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:11,710
an amazing experience to see
what's what they've done.

1409
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:13,780
You see all these tall buildings now,

1410
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:19,470
but the one officers' club that was on
the roof of one of the hotels is still

1411
01:41:24,131 --> 01:41:28,810
there exactly the same. And we, my
wife and I went up and had lunch there

1412
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:33,280
and
it,

1413
01:41:33,281 --> 01:41:36,070
my time before I went out to the unit,

1414
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:40,510
I used to go up there
and we'd go up to eat.

1415
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:44,980
You Watch out here and see the,
uh,

1416
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,900
the sabers, not sabers. Um,

1417
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:55,180
what do you, what do you call the
browns that are stressors? The tracers.

1418
01:41:55,210 --> 01:41:59,410
Thank you.
See all the tracers from being fired up,

1419
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:00,910
upper back down.

1420
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:06,150
And it was sort of unique experience
because you really weren't fighting a war

1421
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:12,280
in Saigon, you know, it was, it was

1422
01:42:13,810 --> 01:42:18,220
so different from there when
you went out into the field. So,

1423
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:23,410
but, uh, it was, it was fun to go
back and see what they've done.

1424
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:29,790
And I was impressed with how much the
south Vietnamese have really been serious

1425
01:42:31,871 --> 01:42:35,170
about getting real business and
going and a lot of things happening.

1426
01:42:35,171 --> 01:42:38,380
Business was up north.
It's still a GRE.

1427
01:42:38,970 --> 01:42:42,310
It was still a grant at the
time. Very Agrarian. You, it mean

1428
01:42:44,200 --> 01:42:47,410
very few tall buildings,
very few businesses,

1429
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,760
and so that you could identify and
maybe it's still the same that goes,

1430
01:42:53,810 --> 01:42:56,950
that was, that was 11
years ago now. But, uh,

1431
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,890
and I don't know what's
changed to over there,

1432
01:42:59,891 --> 01:43:04,840
but so the north Viet Mimi's one no war,

1433
01:43:04,841 --> 01:43:09,370
so to speak. Uh, I say that
with tongue in cheek actually,

1434
01:43:09,371 --> 01:43:10,940
but they won the war.

1435
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:15,790
But I'm not sure that the south Vietnamese
aren't coming back and taking over

1436
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,880
and running the country. They certainly
have the financial strength there. Uh,

1437
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:25,600
and I hope that's a way it,
eventually it will work out

1438
01:43:25,770 --> 01:43:27,210
well the way the rest of the world's gone.

1439
01:43:27,211 --> 01:43:32,211
It's in freedom and
democracy and capitalism that
eventually wins the long war.

1440
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:35,310
And we've seen that worldwide. So
hopefully it'll happen for them as well.

1441
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:39,450
How'd you get wounded your third, your
third time getting wounded in Vietnam?

1442
01:43:40,990 --> 01:43:43,140
Well I was,

1443
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:46,630
I was one of the missions we had

1444
01:43:48,310 --> 01:43:53,310
every evening we'd go into a perimeter
and most of the time we'd be in a

1445
01:43:54,621 --> 01:43:59,480
perimeter around artillery unit so they
could fire at night without worrying

1446
01:43:59,481 --> 01:44:00,950
about getting over run.

1447
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:06,670
And so I put all of our unit in this
perimeter from my helicopter flying around

1448
01:44:11,240 --> 01:44:12,073
and

1449
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:18,130
I noticed a bunch of sand pants
evacuating the area we had.

1450
01:44:22,310 --> 01:44:26,630
So I thought in my John Wayne felling,

1451
01:44:27,380 --> 01:44:32,200
I want to go down and shoot some
of these guys. So I got to pilot,

1452
01:44:33,230 --> 01:44:35,780
I was flying in this case,
uh,

1453
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,980
in a a two passenger,
I mean one passenger

1454
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:45,890
bubble helicopter. And uh, anyway,

1455
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:50,070
so I had this in 40,
he noted him 40 years.

1456
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,790
It's as far as it looks
like a shotgun shell.

1457
01:44:53,180 --> 01:44:58,140
And so I'm up there and I'm
shooting at these guys in the Sam,

1458
01:44:58,141 --> 01:45:02,600
Ben,
and I'm doing pretty good,

1459
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:05,550
uh, missing a lot, but he,

1460
01:45:05,590 --> 01:45:08,390
so one of them shot back

1461
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:15,170
and my God,
it hit me in the leg.

1462
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:20,990
And so I told the Jabber Pout,
take me back down to the headquarters,

1463
01:45:20,991 --> 01:45:23,210
which voters squat and surgery was.

1464
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,710
And he will never forget,
he,

1465
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:32,790
he took my pants away and there was
blood spray write out all the way out,

1466
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:37,760
at least 18 inches from my leg.
Hit something.

1467
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:40,310
They call this burger.
And he said,

1468
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:46,190
this is a captain speaking to me,
colonel, you goddamn dumb, son of a bitch,

1469
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,000
you could be dead.
So anyway,

1470
01:45:50,001 --> 01:45:55,001
he bandaged me up and the metal
still there still in my leg.

1471
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:57,620
But,
uh,

1472
01:45:58,070 --> 01:46:02,120
where you, where you, are you returning
to duty though, right? Oh yeah. I mean,

1473
01:46:06,090 --> 01:46:09,810
I hadn't been in command more than
30 days. I was scared to death.

1474
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:14,760
I couldn't be evacuated. Hell,
I had finished up my tour.

1475
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:15,780
Let me,
I mean,

1476
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:20,850
so one of my friends named Tim Kennedy
is a green baret and he has a TV show

1477
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:25,050
coming out called hard to kill. I think
maybe we need to get, you all guys

1478
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:30,180
know,
somebody might take me up on it.

1479
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:36,190
Uh, I, I've been fortunate. I mean,

1480
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:41,440
a lot of people got hurt a lot more
serious than I've been. Uh, uh,

1481
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:45,950
and, uh, I've seen some, in fact, uh,

1482
01:46:46,300 --> 01:46:51,200
I've had too many her
seriously, I had, uh,

1483
01:46:52,390 --> 01:46:54,310
one of my, uh, my

1484
01:46:56,870 --> 01:47:01,870
axel was in the helicopter and got shot
up to the seat of the helicopter and all

1485
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:05,081
the shrapnel,

1486
01:47:05,081 --> 01:47:09,910
everything went right into
his leg and he was forever,

1487
01:47:10,090 --> 01:47:13,160
uh, in bad shape. I mean, I mean,

1488
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:16,810
I've seen a lot of people
get hurt pretty badly. Uh,

1489
01:47:18,410 --> 01:47:21,490
I been, I've been fortunate. I mean,

1490
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:28,690
but I'm also had the attitude, I'm not
going to get shot and killed. I mean,

1491
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:33,880
no, it's worked out. But, uh,

1492
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:37,540
going back to, well, you know,

1493
01:47:37,541 --> 01:47:41,290
when I got out of that
tank to go back in Korea,

1494
01:47:41,860 --> 01:47:44,200
I had no more idea that I
was going to get killed,

1495
01:47:44,201 --> 01:47:49,060
that that wasn't going to enter into
my mind. I just had something to do.

1496
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:54,190
And uh,
that may be foolish,

1497
01:47:54,700 --> 01:47:57,220
but, uh, it's just the way it was.

1498
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:03,010
Yeah. I think if you're,
if you were thinking about
what could happen, you know,

1499
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:05,670
wouldn't do anything, you
couldn't do anything. Right. Yeah.

1500
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:08,250
So you're,

1501
01:48:09,340 --> 01:48:13,060
you wrap up your squadron commander
in Vietnam and again, I, I mean,

1502
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:17,560
you were taking, how often would you
guys, you're getting in firefights a lot.

1503
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,740
What was your,
what was your cash rate of casualties?

1504
01:48:20,741 --> 01:48:23,530
Like how many guys did you lose?

1505
01:48:23,531 --> 01:48:25,900
How many people were killed while
you were there as a squatter

1506
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:30,750
commander? How many were
killed? Probably 10.

1507
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:36,330
Not too many. I mean, uh,

1508
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:43,260
when you have a calves,
do you know what an ache have is?

1509
01:48:43,290 --> 01:48:44,980
That's a personnel carrier.
I mean,

1510
01:48:45,630 --> 01:48:50,570
it cast has her armored calvary
assault vehicle, but it's, uh, it's,

1511
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:54,630
it was the [inaudible] back in those days.
I don't know.

1512
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:55,680
I don't know what they're called.

1513
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:59,610
We still used [inaudible].
We used them one thirteens in Ramadi,

1514
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:02,960
the same exact vehicle.
So we are very familiar with it.

1515
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:04,110
We both written in the back.

1516
01:49:04,430 --> 01:49:05,000
Yeah,

1517
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,000
well they're pretty well protected and
the tanks or we had patent tanks and

1518
01:49:12,321 --> 01:49:16,460
they're protected. So, uh, yeah,

1519
01:49:16,580 --> 01:49:20,650
we had casualties, uh, because in,

1520
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,360
in a,
in a calvary troop,

1521
01:49:24,350 --> 01:49:29,120
we have infantry right in the outcasts.
So when he get out, he got her.

1522
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:34,340
But I don't know the statistics. Uh,

1523
01:49:35,470 --> 01:49:37,910
I,
I wrote enough letters

1524
01:49:39,800 --> 01:49:44,690
but not very mean one is
more than enough, but, uh,

1525
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:51,640
I, I don't remember how
many I wrote. Uh, but,

1526
01:49:51,641 --> 01:49:55,570
uh, cause I did that for
everybody was who's killed? Uh,

1527
01:49:57,270 --> 01:50:01,570
but, uh, I don't, I don't
know the statistics, uh,

1528
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:07,230
not to not overburden burdened.
I mean, in this incident,

1529
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:08,683
uh,

1530
01:50:11,470 --> 01:50:14,950
I got several people's names on the wall.
Uh,

1531
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:21,970
I go there every year.
She's just to stand there.

1532
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:29,190
But I don't know Jack who, I
don't know the answer. Understood,

1533
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:30,033
sir.

1534
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:33,970
When you got home from Vietnam,
you know,

1535
01:50:33,971 --> 01:50:38,830
you talked about coming home from Korea,
Netherlands in uniform,

1536
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:40,413
and

1537
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:41,731
you know,

1538
01:50:41,731 --> 01:50:46,410
we hear stories of guys coming home from
Vietnam and they literally get told,

1539
01:50:46,411 --> 01:50:48,060
don't wear your uniform around.

1540
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:52,950
How different was the reception
from World War II Korea to Vietnam?

1541
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:56,713
Well,

1542
01:51:00,590 --> 01:51:02,310
coming back from,
um,

1543
01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:05,840
from Vietnam

1544
01:51:07,820 --> 01:51:11,150
was a sad experience.
Uh,

1545
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:17,030
we thought we've been doing a good job.
We, that we were doing the right job. Um,

1546
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:21,240
and I came back to the Pentagon and

1547
01:51:24,340 --> 01:51:29,340
I sort of witnessed the experience
of the country being up in arms.

1548
01:51:33,861 --> 01:51:37,940
About Vietnam. Um,

1549
01:51:39,050 --> 01:51:41,860
so,
uh,

1550
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:45,910
it didn't feel too appreciate it
I guess is the right word. Uh,

1551
01:51:46,490 --> 01:51:51,200
and yet it didn't feel like I felt
like I'd been doing a good job.

1552
01:51:51,660 --> 01:51:55,220
Uh,
so I don't,

1553
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:00,880
I didn't have, I didn't
have any bad feelings. Uh,

1554
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:08,500
most of those feelings about what was
going on came after I got out of it.

1555
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:10,461
I mean,

1556
01:52:10,461 --> 01:52:15,461
I retired in [inaudible] 69 and things
began to go to hill in the country about

1557
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:21,690
what we're doing over there.
A

1558
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:28,020
while right after I got out, I guess, uh,

1559
01:52:29,810 --> 01:52:33,200
my job and uh,
when I got out,

1560
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:36,170
I mean when I came home was in,

1561
01:52:36,740 --> 01:52:39,500
it's at the secretary of defense's level.
I,

1562
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,320
I told you earlier,

1563
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,250
the army was send me to school
to learn to it with kids.

1564
01:52:47,900 --> 01:52:51,110
Well, guess what? When I came back,

1565
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:55,430
army sent me to be a whiz kid.
I was,

1566
01:52:56,120 --> 01:53:00,800
I was standing up to the
secretary and General Staff,

1567
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,520
Helen n two ovens organization,
which was called systems analysis.

1568
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:12,090
And they asked for all the whiz kids were,
and they had a representative,

1569
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:15,740
the army, Navy, Air Force,
Marine Corps, all four of us.

1570
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:20,550
And we were sure the other end
is a teetotaler. We were, we,

1571
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,960
we were supposed to balance some of
these smart young men that were the quote

1572
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:31,940
kids. And as I tell people,
I've never a whizzer a kid,

1573
01:53:31,941 --> 01:53:36,590
but I was in that organization
and if it was an experience,

1574
01:53:37,790 --> 01:53:40,280
they wouldn't let me
work on anything army.

1575
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:45,440
And I had, because they knew
I had to go back to the army.

1576
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:48,230
She, that was, and you had to,

1577
01:53:48,290 --> 01:53:53,290
you had to be sitting there and making
decisions that could be a against the

1578
01:53:54,111 --> 01:53:54,944
army,

1579
01:53:55,830 --> 01:54:00,140
what the army wanted as
opposed to one of the wonders,

1580
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:02,790
one of the things I was involved with,

1581
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:06,770
because I was involved with
the navy and the air force,

1582
01:54:08,450 --> 01:54:11,720
the navy wanted to build
another nuclear submarine.

1583
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:14,803
Well,

1584
01:54:16,530 --> 01:54:19,890
there's only so many capital
ships that was by law.

1585
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:25,880
So Davey,
I asked why there was,

1586
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:30,770
I can't remember now, I think 13 capital
ships or whatever the number was. I, yeah,

1587
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:32,900
why is that number 13?

1588
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:39,970
It took quite awhile for them to figure
out the answer and it really was very

1589
01:54:40,461 --> 01:54:44,660
simple. You're going back to the League
of nations. Parley, introduce, I mean

1590
01:54:46,340 --> 01:54:49,390
1920 something when they,

1591
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:55,070
they pop partly down to the
various world war of one winners.

1592
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:58,550
There are number of capital
shifts. I, he called battleships,

1593
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:03,830
numbers of ships that each country would
have and that's where the number came

1594
01:55:03,831 --> 01:55:07,010
from. Whoa. I,

1595
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:12,440
Dan was just, uh, now

1596
01:55:14,840 --> 01:55:19,550
I learned to ask that question
because when I was going to Michigan,

1597
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:24,920
one of the professors said,
he's just in statistics class.

1598
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:32,470
I want to know what you wanted or watch,
not what the results are.

1599
01:55:32,710 --> 01:55:35,610
I want to know what the
assumptions are and know.

1600
01:55:35,710 --> 01:55:40,690
So I was asking this assumption,
why is your x number of capital ships?

1601
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:45,810
It was just simple question. I, I
didn't know I was creating a challenge.

1602
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:47,920
I mean it,
it,

1603
01:55:48,160 --> 01:55:51,270
it turned out to be
exactly what I was saying.

1604
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:56,600
It was a strange phenomenon for them
to try to figure out why there was that

1605
01:55:58,861 --> 01:56:02,160
number.
I don't know what the world is now,

1606
01:56:02,161 --> 01:56:04,530
but I can tell you at that point,

1607
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:09,550
this was the 1968, I guess. Uh,

1608
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:13,680
it was, uh, a question that
they took a while to answer.

1609
01:56:15,240 --> 01:56:16,073
By the way,

1610
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:19,140
I don't know how many capital shifts
we'll have and I don't know what to call

1611
01:56:19,141 --> 01:56:23,310
the day, but we have a lot more than
I think we had back in those days.

1612
01:56:24,360 --> 01:56:28,980
So what made you decide to retire?
Well,

1613
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:32,790
I had 25 years in the military

1614
01:56:34,650 --> 01:56:39,100
and I decided I wanted to think
about doing something else. Uh,

1615
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:47,820
part of it was I used to
listen to people tell me,

1616
01:56:49,140 --> 01:56:52,470
you just order people to do
things and they do it. I said,

1617
01:56:52,471 --> 01:56:54,330
that's just a lot of Bulani.

1618
01:56:55,860 --> 01:57:00,210
So I wanted to go and see
who got my, if you would, uh,

1619
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:04,800
teeth on trying something
Savine would world.

1620
01:57:05,790 --> 01:57:06,670
So,
uh,

1621
01:57:07,650 --> 01:57:11,550
I signed a bunch of resumes
out and I eventually

1622
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:18,920
was hired to go down to a Texas and a
fellow that hired me was retired navy

1623
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:32,260
aviator, who by the way, uh,

1624
01:57:32,640 --> 01:57:37,320
as an aside with assigned to the
first squadron, I think it's called,

1625
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:40,320
it flew jets off aircraft carriers.

1626
01:57:42,090 --> 01:57:46,410
Guy By name of Felix to
Blonsky was a wonderful man.

1627
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:51,420
And, but if you wanted
to know what time it was,

1628
01:57:51,421 --> 01:57:54,850
he'd tell you how to build a watch.
So there's that.

1629
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:58,590
But he, he, uh,

1630
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:02,520
he hired me and our job there

1631
01:58:03,790 --> 01:58:04,623
no,

1632
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:11,310
was to figure out how to use from Ltvs,

1633
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:14,290
uh,
computer resources,

1634
01:58:14,410 --> 01:58:18,130
how to use these and civilian application.

1635
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:21,003
And

1636
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:30,180
one of the things we did
was we developed for Dallas

1637
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:38,140
x's and o's that they used
to do on the job board,

1638
01:58:39,160 --> 01:58:40,840
on the computer screen,

1639
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:48,150
and just became a way that apparently
Dallas cowboys would teach the guys how to

1640
01:58:50,440 --> 01:58:52,210
react to whatever plays it was.

1641
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:58,080
So that was using some
of this fancy technology,

1642
01:58:58,931 --> 01:59:03,931
that LTV head to build something
that was applicable in Savannah life.

1643
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:10,720
Well,
laying of LTV,

1644
01:59:10,721 --> 01:59:12,050
Lang Timko vote

1645
01:59:14,020 --> 01:59:17,540
suddenly got challenged
because he was creating, uh,

1646
01:59:18,490 --> 01:59:20,050
a huge empire

1647
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:26,530
and the antitrust people got after him.
And all of a sudden,

1648
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:31,040
our organism,
the part that I was in was,

1649
01:59:31,041 --> 01:59:35,380
went from 30 people to four. And that
was one of the four. And I don't know,

1650
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:36,161
to this day,

1651
01:59:36,161 --> 01:59:39,970
I still don't know why they can't meet
you because I'd just been there less than

1652
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:44,800
a year. But the guy who had tried
to hire me into computer sciences

1653
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:51,970
previously offered me a
job with computer sciences.

1654
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:54,880
I mean,
even though I had a job,

1655
01:59:55,150 --> 02:00:00,150
I knew that this place was not a
place that had longterm open up B.

1656
02:00:00,550 --> 02:00:05,550
So I went to work for computer science
as an ethnic 15 years there and,

1657
02:00:05,561 --> 02:00:09,910
uh, and ended up retiring from there, uh,

1658
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:13,240
is one of the presidents and
one of their divisions. And, uh,

1659
02:00:16,720 --> 02:00:21,580
one of the things that
my bosses used to say,

1660
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:26,770
I was one of the few leaders,
they had been a lot of managers,

1661
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:28,083
but,
uh,

1662
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:32,650
I was leading a group and
we became very successful,

1663
02:00:33,070 --> 02:00:35,950
much more so than I ever
imagined we could be.

1664
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:41,500
It was primarily in sales and marketing.
And I had a boss that said,

1665
02:00:41,501 --> 02:00:46,501
who was from my BM and
strict IBM suit kind of guy,

1666
02:00:47,200 --> 02:00:50,170
you know, you've heard all
the stories. And he said,

1667
02:00:52,360 --> 02:00:53,193
he said,

1668
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:58,200
if I would go back to my comrades at IBM
and tell him that I just hired a former

1669
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:04,060
army colonel to piano sales,
they all think I was God damn crazy.

1670
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,850
And so anyway,

1671
02:01:07,630 --> 02:01:11,680
I had a great career
computer sciences and uh,

1672
02:01:13,090 --> 02:01:16,630
as I said, I retired from there and

1673
02:01:18,370 --> 02:01:23,020
I'm not a typist.
When I was going to high school,

1674
02:01:23,350 --> 02:01:26,770
if you took typing, you weren't
going to college, it was back.

1675
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:32,910
So this thing called voicemail
appeared to me and I thought,

1676
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:37,090
so
another fill on,

1677
02:01:37,091 --> 02:01:41,360
I started a company in
the voicemail business,

1678
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:45,650
1984. And, uh, it,

1679
02:01:46,040 --> 02:01:51,040
it was pretty successful and we sold it
in 1998 and I've stopped working since

1680
02:01:55,041 --> 02:01:55,874
then.

1681
02:01:58,080 --> 02:02:00,360
Well that is awesome.

1682
02:02:00,400 --> 02:02:05,220
I know we've kept you here for
a couple hours now and uh, um,

1683
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:09,930
probably a good place to at least stop
for this, for this particular session.

1684
02:02:10,410 --> 02:02:12,390
Um,
is there anything else you want to say?

1685
02:02:12,391 --> 02:02:14,960
Anything else you want to
close out with what I can,

1686
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:18,060
I can say this that I met my wife,

1687
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:20,093
uh,

1688
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:24,620
on my first assignment
from the Pentagon and I,

1689
02:02:25,430 --> 02:02:30,430
my job in the Pentagon among other things
was to control the number of troops on

1690
02:02:31,641 --> 02:02:32,990
the ground in Vietnam.

1691
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:37,940
Congress mandated be 550,000
people on the ground.

1692
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:44,240
My job was to be shared
that that number was mitt.

1693
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:47,150
So when the secretary of
defense went to Congress,

1694
02:02:47,151 --> 02:02:51,530
he could always say that
we have never heard. So

1695
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:58,010
on a quarterly basis I would go to
Hawaii and in people from Hawaii,

1696
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,570
Thailand,
Korea,

1697
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:04,720
Philippines and Hawaii would all meet
at the headquarters here up on the hill.

1698
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:09,800
And we'd go over,
cause what,

1699
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:14,450
when Westmoreland a lot to replace
an attic battalion was an infant.

1700
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:17,360
You pertained to different numbers
and everything's different.

1701
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:22,780
So we had to do all this monitoring and
keeping track of how many troops we hit.

1702
02:03:25,970 --> 02:03:30,410
My wife was a school teacher in California
and she was over there on a vacation

1703
02:03:31,100 --> 02:03:35,930
and one of my former
colleagues from Vietnam,

1704
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:40,190
she knew him and some on another.

1705
02:03:41,390 --> 02:03:45,140
We met
for the next two years,

1706
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:50,360
we dated cross country. She didn't
California, me and the Pentagon.

1707
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:55,490
And I would go every quarter to the
Hawaiian islands for this meeting I'm

1708
02:03:55,491 --> 02:03:56,324
telling you about.

1709
02:03:56,510 --> 02:04:01,510
So I'd plant the meeting to be started
on Tuesday so I could fly from here to

1710
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:07,820
California,
spend some time with her.

1711
02:04:08,390 --> 02:04:11,750
Then I'd fly off after Hawaiian islands.

1712
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:16,280
And then on the way back I'd step into
the same thing and it'd be a backer.

1713
02:04:16,640 --> 02:04:19,070
So anyway, we got married in, uh,

1714
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:24,590
19 after I got out or retired and 69.

1715
02:04:24,591 --> 02:04:27,830
And we got married in October 69. And, uh,

1716
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:32,480
the reason I'm still living
today is because of her.

1717
02:04:34,880 --> 02:04:39,720
She keeps me alive, takes
care of me. I made a,

1718
02:04:40,470 --> 02:04:42,960
uh, so she's, she's, uh,

1719
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:47,470
the principal reason that I
can sit here and talk to Ya.

1720
02:04:48,450 --> 02:04:50,640
Well then we'll say thank you,

1721
02:04:50,641 --> 02:04:55,530
you for coming on and we'll say thank
you to your wife for getting you here.

1722
02:04:55,890 --> 02:04:59,230
Cause uh, sir, once again,
this has just been a,

1723
02:04:59,231 --> 02:05:02,070
an absolute honor to
be able to talk to you,

1724
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:07,190
to be able to hear the stories and the
lessons that you learned and thank you.

1725
02:05:08,100 --> 02:05:12,570
Well from all of us for, for
your service, your sacrifice.

1726
02:05:13,050 --> 02:05:14,730
And it's been an honor.

1727
02:05:14,910 --> 02:05:18,500
Well,
you all deserve the honor to meet

1728
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:23,550
you guys.
I don't know what I'd be,

1729
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:27,510
what it would be like to be in the
service today, frankly. I mean,

1730
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:31,140
I see these guys,
my,

1731
02:05:31,530 --> 02:05:33,720
my nephew deployed six times,

1732
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:37,950
twice to Iraq,

1733
02:05:38,460 --> 02:05:43,460
once for the Somali extraction
plus three other times,

1734
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:46,740
just the flying, you know, and

1735
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,033
now

1736
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:55,530
how he did this, I'll never know,
but he never left camp Pendleton.

1737
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:58,110
I mean he did.
He,

1738
02:05:58,250 --> 02:06:03,250
he was a drill sergeant down at MCRD,

1739
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:07,270
but he'd commute back to
back to Pendleton. I mean,

1740
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:12,480
his wife lived there the whole time.

1741
02:06:12,481 --> 02:06:16,600
He was 20 some odd years in the
Marine Corps on the same. I,

1742
02:06:17,070 --> 02:06:20,130
I never figured that out.
I moved around like,

1743
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:24,570
but my wife would tell you
she,

1744
02:06:24,660 --> 02:06:28,390
she and I got married after I got
all this room for an our 17th outs.

1745
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:34,080
We've only been married for
almost 49 years. I mean,

1746
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:38,540
so everybody said, well, you were in
the military. We didn't do it this way.

1747
02:06:38,790 --> 02:06:43,410
She was never in the military. We, we
moved all the time since then. I mean,

1748
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:46,470
you stay in San Diego,

1749
02:06:48,050 --> 02:06:52,000
I'll do my best, sir, I'll
do my best. And again,

1750
02:06:52,030 --> 02:06:54,220
you have to absolutely.
The troops that are out there today,

1751
02:06:54,221 --> 02:06:57,820
and there's a lot of troops that listen
to this guys out there hold the line and

1752
02:06:58,300 --> 02:07:02,080
doing those deployments over
and over again. But you know,

1753
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:06,340
the work that we do today is based on
the lessons that we learn from your

1754
02:07:06,341 --> 02:07:11,230
generations, from the three wars that
you fought and what you passed on to us.

1755
02:07:11,290 --> 02:07:14,980
And it was an honor for us to
continue to carry the flag.

1756
02:07:14,981 --> 02:07:19,210
So thank you. See You keep
carrying it. Yes. Here. Yes sir.

1757
02:07:20,050 --> 02:07:25,050
And Colonel Tom Fife has departed
and obviously it is a honor to uh,

1758
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:32,590
get to talk to him and thanks for
setting that up Dave. Yeah, man,

1759
02:07:32,591 --> 02:07:37,360
that was awesome. Much appreciated.
Three war veteran, I mean,

1760
02:07:37,361 --> 02:07:40,990
come on,
come on.

1761
02:07:41,080 --> 02:07:45,700
That's just unbelievably awesome to sit
and listen to and, and you know what,

1762
02:07:45,701 --> 02:07:48,670
thanks Dave for setting that up
and also thanks to everyone that,

1763

1774
02:08:37,771 --> 02:08:39,160
I dunno if you've ever been on the,

1775
02:08:40,020 --> 02:08:43,410
in the situation of running out of super
crew. When you depend on Super Krill,

1776
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:49,200
it's bad situation and if you ever
want to reduce the risk of running out,

1777
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:55,020
do the subscription thing, that's what
I do. Kind of subscription subscription.

You just get your allotted amount per
month or however often you need it.

1780
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:04,230
Also pre mission supplement.
It's called

1781
02:09:04,310 --> 02:09:08,450
discipline. Hold on Dave, you
are firing up on discipline.

1782
02:09:09,410 --> 02:09:13,010
You, you said, you said to me and
I quote, I live on discipline.

1783
02:09:13,850 --> 02:09:18,530
It has become a daily part of my life for
sure. You've got it in the brain. Yup.

1784
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,060
You use it before you work. Yup. You're
studying, you're working, you're prepping.

1785
02:09:23,510 --> 02:09:27,140
That's your go to this stuff is awesome.
I use it probably more than I should.

1786
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:32,480
Yeah, it's a jet. I don't know if
there is a, some kind of uh, you know,

1787
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:34,100
limitation health wise,

1788
02:09:34,130 --> 02:09:39,120
like if you're drinking nine
gallons and gallons. Yeah.

1789
02:09:41,450 --> 02:09:42,620
Jack.
All right.

1790
02:09:42,680 --> 02:09:45,080
Well there, there it is.
It's at the of everything.

1791
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:49,550
Pre Mission preworkout pretest taking,
pre meeting,

1792
02:09:49,551 --> 02:09:50,430
pre Jujitsu Zoo

1793
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:55,010
and now you're going to get
mad or whatever or you're
going to make you give me

1794
02:09:55,011 --> 02:09:58,100
your attitude because you know you make
fun of me cause I wanted it to taste

1795
02:09:58,101 --> 02:09:59,670
good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1796
02:09:59,671 --> 02:10:03,560
You make fun of me and there's not even
that much I can say about that because

1797
02:10:03,770 --> 02:10:08,000
it's a legitimate thing. True
for, for me the Jocko to be like,

1798
02:10:08,001 --> 02:10:11,120
oh I want it to taste good. It's kind
of a weakness, right? It's kind of soft.

1799
02:10:11,121 --> 02:10:14,540
Right.
Well that being said,

1800
02:10:15,110 --> 02:10:20,090
we have another flavor coming. I'm going
to tell you what, well, first of all,

1801
02:10:20,110 --> 02:10:23,060
it's a two things. Well first of all,
it tastes good. Yeah, I know Bro.

1802
02:10:23,130 --> 02:10:26,610
Second of all it's,
it's,

1803
02:10:27,230 --> 02:10:31,340
it's basically Pina Colada,
but I can't call it that.

1804
02:10:31,341 --> 02:10:34,130
And it's like I can't do,
I can't do

1805
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,520
that. It's going to be called the
coconut pineapple. Sure. You know,

1806
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:41,780
we're not going just straight Pina
colada cause I just can't. This is not,

1807
02:10:41,781 --> 02:10:44,930
that's not how, no, no,
that's not out, eh. Yeah.

1808
02:10:44,931 --> 02:10:48,950
You did mention that and I'm impressed
that you sticking with the delicious,

1809
02:10:49,470 --> 02:10:53,440
a luxurious tastes
clean, you know, do that.

1810
02:10:53,450 --> 02:10:56,480
But that's one of those things like you
like Pina Colada, you like that flavor.

1811
02:10:57,500 --> 02:10:59,240
Like I've heard of people
not really liking it,

1812
02:10:59,270 --> 02:11:01,880
but that could have to do with the fact
that you know how like when you drink

1813
02:11:01,881 --> 02:11:05,900
alcohol too much and it has like a
star, like Tequila, we'll have it.

1814
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:08,270
Peanut coladas is like that.
If you just drink too many of them,

1815
02:11:08,271 --> 02:11:11,840
you get drunk and that experience
now you can never drink it again.

1816
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:15,350
Now if you smell it,
you feel off. Tequila.

1817
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:17,660
Tequila is like that for sure.

1818
02:11:20,090 --> 02:11:21,500
During my younger years,

1819
02:11:21,501 --> 02:11:26,501
I had like a 14 month hiatus from
Jaeger after I had a bets bad sitch.

1820
02:11:28,260 --> 02:11:32,480
Yeah, so peanut clouds. I was young
and stupid. You know what young,

1821
02:11:32,481 --> 02:11:36,800
stupid and motivated like you know when
you're actually motivated the coroner to

1822
02:11:36,801 --> 02:11:41,420
do with this. That's bad.
Dumb. Yeah, but check,

1823
02:11:41,690 --> 02:11:43,520
if you haven't had that
experience with Pina Colada,

1824
02:11:43,521 --> 02:11:47,420
I would assume that that's a,
that's a pretty high rate of acceptance.

1825
02:11:47,421 --> 02:11:51,200
As far as deliciousness goes. In my
opinion or in my, by my estimation,

1826
02:11:51,201 --> 02:11:55,760
I think my hypothesis or whatever.
Nonetheless it's called disciplines,

1827
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:56,541
pre mission.

1828
02:11:56,541 --> 02:12:01,541
This whether you love Pina Colada or
love lemon lime ish flavor with other

1829
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:06,560
delicious factors in it.
That's a good thing.

1830
02:12:06,561 --> 02:12:10,580
But it's good because it makes your brain
more healthy and your body pre mission

1831
02:12:10,620 --> 02:12:13,000
preworkout pretest taking pre meeting,
pre Jujitsu,

1832
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:17,240
pre workout cognitive and
physical force multiplier.

1833
02:12:17,241 --> 02:12:19,400
This is what that is.
So get on now.

1834
02:12:19,401 --> 02:12:23,180
And of course also Giza in rash guards.
Dave Burke.

1835
02:12:25,430 --> 02:12:29,150
Yeah. You missed the milk.
Yeah, I didn't really miss it.

1836
02:12:29,151 --> 02:12:33,080
I was going to save it for last but not
all. I'll get back in my lane over here.

1837
02:12:33,090 --> 02:12:36,680
No, because the just had a whole thing.
I was going to do it. Brash cards.

1838
02:12:36,681 --> 02:12:37,191
Tell me about it.

1839
02:12:37,191 --> 02:12:40,220
I feel like we should do the molten now
cause you've got kind of kind of brought

1840
02:12:40,221 --> 02:12:45,130
it up, which is you know, if for lack
of a better term it's actually it,

1841
02:12:45,190 --> 02:12:49,370
it is a better term. It's not
protein, it's protein powder,

1842
02:12:49,730 --> 02:12:54,470
but it's a better term for this particular
protein powder milk, mint chocolate.

1843
02:12:54,471 --> 02:12:56,990
Just because he didn't know
deeper brick here on the milk yet.

1844
02:12:57,110 --> 02:13:00,050
He's not on the market and just told
me he's going to get it this week.

1845
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:04,550
Well I will say this, I never was into
protein powder. Aside from, you know,

1846
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:07,580
you're still in high school, you're
still not, I'm still hearing the mold,

1847
02:13:09,860 --> 02:13:11,330
right? Correct, correct.

1848
02:13:11,570 --> 02:13:15,050
But this one is one of those good ones
were kind of like you and the discipline

1849
02:13:15,051 --> 02:13:18,880
where you're like pounding it all the
time. So I give my daughter dessert.

1850
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:23,630
Oh yeah, this is a dessert straight
up, straight up desert is that good?

1851
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:27,350
And don't put a couple of drops of
the dill in there. Tried to do that.

1852
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:31,070
But two drops, little Manila putting
an egg and put it in the blender.

1853
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:36,060
In fact, you know what? Don't do it. Don't
do it. You'll be in the same boat as me.

1854
02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:38,830
That's when the last, it's like a
dessert and those protein nights.

1855
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:42,090
Good man cause I used to make
these milkshakes when I was young.

1856
02:13:42,350 --> 02:13:45,510
I'm just a homemade
probably.

1857
02:13:46,890 --> 02:13:51,210
Probably it nonetheless thing used to
make these milkshakes when I was young

1858
02:13:51,211 --> 02:13:54,060
they were,
they had vanilla egg,

1859
02:13:54,210 --> 02:13:57,270
like a teeny tiny piece of banana milk

1860
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:04,110
and some other stuff,
some sugar in there and it was good.

1861
02:14:04,110 --> 02:14:06,090
It was like a solid milkshake like good,

1862
02:14:06,091 --> 02:14:07,600
like almost like you
bought it from a grower.

1863
02:14:07,601 --> 02:14:12,120
May spot is no joke when it comes
to milkshakes. Simulator, mint,

1864
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:16,530
mint chocolate, peanut butter,
peanut butter, chocolate,

1865
02:14:17,550 --> 02:14:21,600
chocolate, peanut butter milk is on
its way. Straight up. Dave Burke.

1866
02:14:21,601 --> 02:14:22,860
When you get on it you're
going to stay on that.

1867
02:14:22,861 --> 02:14:26,160
So you're just going to be pounding
discipline and mock like all day. The way,

1868
02:14:26,161 --> 02:14:26,994
the way Dave Berg,

1869
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:32,070
only days easier look like echo
Charles swollen six months, dude,

1870
02:14:32,130 --> 02:14:34,860
lifting, Jujitsu, walk, all that stuff.

1871
02:14:34,890 --> 02:14:39,000
Also ds and rash guards.
We can talk about that if you want,

1872
02:14:39,001 --> 02:14:42,120
unless you have another suggestion on
what else I should talk about at this

1873
02:14:42,121 --> 02:14:44,850
point. I'm, I'm saying I want
to do the right thing over here.

1874
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:48,660
I know what I'm saying. Dave Berg kind
of get you up. Dave Berg. He diggy right?

1875
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:49,470
I do.
I have to.

1876
02:14:49,470 --> 02:14:54,470
So here's the one good thing
about starting Jujitsu with
45 I discovered the one

1877
02:14:54,661 --> 02:14:59,460
good thing about it instead of starting
at 15 is I never had any of those

1878
02:14:59,461 --> 02:15:03,120
stories where I tell about
how uncomfortable the gear
is or how the rash guards

1879
02:15:03,121 --> 02:15:05,790
gave me, you know, are they,
these are hard to wash.

1880
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,700
I got origin main gives time
to go from the get. Go ahead.

1881
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:15,540
Someone that never had a flip phone in
1994 just woke up and they had an iPhone

1882
02:15:15,631 --> 02:15:19,790
six started with the iPhone 10 out
of the gate. Origin man, rash guards.

1883
02:15:19,791 --> 02:15:22,890
So I don't know what it's like to have
grown up with all that terrible. Gary,

1884
02:15:22,891 --> 02:15:24,480
you guys use what it was like.

1885
02:15:28,200 --> 02:15:31,470
Well that's actually good news
in my, in my opinion. You know,

1886
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:34,650
because working,
not working,

1887
02:15:34,651 --> 02:15:38,850
but you know like working out and doing
your due to the in a junk g pry the

1888
02:15:38,851 --> 02:15:40,020
first gear head man.

1889
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:44,250
You know how you like any like you ever
when you buy your first suit, same deal.

1890
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,030
Like you didn't know.

1891
02:15:45,030 --> 02:15:48,620
I Dunno in my like I don't know how that
thought that was just like, oh I see.

1892
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:51,600
Go suit on, let me go buy one. I
don't know, whatever. So same thing.

1893
02:15:51,601 --> 02:15:56,360
So I went and bought a g and it was like
I bought a cheap one 40 bucks. I know.

1894
02:15:56,370 --> 02:15:56,740
Straight up.

1895
02:15:56,740 --> 02:16:01,680
See I bought my first Guiyu isn't a key
I bought from the Quito store cause the

1896
02:16:01,681 --> 02:16:05,820
Jujitsu place, they were like, it's 100
bucks. I'm like, oh cool. Not Happening.

1897
02:16:05,970 --> 02:16:09,630
I'll go find a different one.
And I found that the Cheapo unbleached.

1898
02:16:09,631 --> 02:16:10,464
Have you ever heard of this?

1899
02:16:10,710 --> 02:16:15,270
Unbleached cotton that was even cheaper
than the bleach color. It's an off white.

1900
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:18,670
Yeah. It feels like it's filled with
steel wool scratching getting your skin.

1901
02:16:19,230 --> 02:16:24,170
But that's hard. And it lasted like
four weeks. So yeah, get a quality,

1902
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:29,100
give yourself an orgy gay. That was
Nikita. Quito, Quito Gig. It looked,

1903
02:16:29,950 --> 02:16:30,100
it

1904
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:34,950
felt similar. Yeah. From the
external viewpoint to a Jujitsu guy,

1905
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:39,700
but it wasn't,
and it damn sure wasn't made in America

1906
02:16:41,290 --> 02:16:42,160
made in Maine.

1907
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:47,200
You know what's awesome is tend to know
to literally know the people because

1908
02:16:47,930 --> 02:16:52,060
we'd been to the factory. I know that
people that, that made those, I know them.

1909
02:16:52,110 --> 02:16:55,610
Yeah. I like I say, Oh hey, how are you
doing? Oh, I'm over here making a key.

1910
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:59,260
That's real. That's what's
happening. Yeah. And on top of that,

1911
02:16:59,410 --> 02:17:01,540
not to mention the cotton,

1912
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:05,410
that was a loom to right there in the
building by the way, is from America too.

1913
02:17:05,411 --> 02:17:09,910
That's something you, so I was talking
about Pete, about this, the cotton,

1914
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:15,180
it's not all carpets. It's um,
what does it Polly, Polly, Polly.

1915
02:17:15,310 --> 02:17:20,310
So it's a poly cotton blend and I thought
that the two strands were different

1916
02:17:20,590 --> 02:17:23,890
and it's woven together.
Nome, the, they make that,

1917
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:28,690
that actual thread is co cotton,
poly cotton,

1918
02:17:28,870 --> 02:17:32,590
the thread, the thread itself
that you weave is, that's why,

1919
02:17:32,710 --> 02:17:35,350
that's why you can put it in the dryer
to dry like a normal piece of clothing,

1920
02:17:35,410 --> 02:17:36,850
not four hours.

1921
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:39,760
You call it out in yourself to hang it
up cause it's all cotton and it just

1922
02:17:39,820 --> 02:17:44,490
holds onto the water. Vic cast gets
out of their main America. Oh good.

1923
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,060
So yeah. Good, good. Dave
Burke, boom. Origin G,

1924
02:17:49,510 --> 02:17:52,270
no history of discomfort in other geese.
No.

1925
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:57,280
No Stinky area of the house where wet
ghees are hanging up for four days now.

1926
02:17:59,650 --> 02:18:01,480
And I'll say this for
all this stuff at origin,

1927
02:18:01,660 --> 02:18:04,690
everything they make is awesome on
their website that talk about the uh,

1928
02:18:04,691 --> 02:18:06,730
the Hoodie and they call it the
most comfortable of any ever.

1929
02:18:07,090 --> 02:18:09,100
I grew up a hundred
percent wearing hoodies.

1930
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:11,500
If you grow up in southern California,
when it gets really cold out,

1931
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:12,363
you put on a Hoodie.

1932
02:18:12,850 --> 02:18:16,150
The origin Hoodie is the most
comfortable hoodies I've ever owned.

1933
02:18:16,600 --> 02:18:20,890
So that stuff is legit. No joke. No,
no personal offense to you, Dave,

1934
02:18:20,891 --> 02:18:24,340
because I respect you. I do, I
really respect you as a person,

1935
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:29,520
but your level of measuring comfort is
not even close to echo and echo is a sort

1936
02:18:29,861 --> 02:18:33,970
of the quality comfort control guy and
he has already made this statement.

1937
02:18:33,971 --> 02:18:38,971
So you saying is like everyone
is listening on whenever
you were in the Marine

1938
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:40,090
Corps,
you know you've done some,

1939
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:43,270
you know you've done some tough stuff in
your life and they're looking at echo.

1940
02:18:43,271 --> 02:18:44,680
They're like, wait, they have echo fits.

1941
02:18:44,681 --> 02:18:49,150
It's comfortable where in that
actual Steven has meaning. Yeah,

1942
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:51,760
yeah, I will. But I will
say, you know, sure.

1943
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:55,000
Like of course Dave Burke of course
we all knew that. You know I've, yeah,

1944
02:18:55,180 --> 02:18:58,000
I am the gold standard of
comfort evaluation for sure.

1945
02:18:58,150 --> 02:19:02,410
I think and I will second that.
It is the Hoodie and the pants by the way.

1946
02:19:03,970 --> 02:19:07,090
So yeah, get those as
well. All made in America.

1947
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:10,430
The compression gear and rash guards,
all that.

1948
02:19:10,780 --> 02:19:13,900
I'm just saying there's all this stuff
on the website or did you mean.com and

1949
02:19:13,930 --> 02:19:17,800
get all this stuff. The hoodie,
the geese, the rash guards,

1950
02:19:18,410 --> 02:19:21,790
sweat pants, other stuff. A lot of
cool stuff on there. Check it out.

1951
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:26,350
You want something? Get something.
Also the immersion camp.

1952
02:19:26,410 --> 02:19:28,070
Did you get to camp? Boom. Just

1953
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:33,070
got a message from someone from Florida
young lady from Florida saying saying,

1954
02:19:33,680 --> 02:19:36,620
I want to go to the emerging camp,
but I won't know anyone there.

1955
02:19:37,850 --> 02:19:42,620
And the only one from Florida.
What do you think? Hey,

1956
02:19:42,621 --> 02:19:43,550
you know me kind of.

1957
02:19:43,551 --> 02:19:46,930
I guess if you could send me the message
or you know me probably know Jocko to

1958
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:50,690
echo, you know me and that means you
know Dave Burke, no, three of us,

1959
02:19:50,900 --> 02:19:55,640
three people already. And here's the
good thing where when you go there,

1960
02:19:55,670 --> 02:19:59,240
we technically sure knew each other.
And you knew Pete.

1961
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:00,590
That was the first time I met Pete.

1962
02:20:01,130 --> 02:20:04,610
I met probably what?

1963
02:20:04,850 --> 02:20:09,050
Like the first 15 minutes
we met about 20 people

1964
02:20:10,970 --> 02:20:13,190
and we hung out with those 20 people.

1965
02:20:13,191 --> 02:20:16,100
Plus the other people you meet
over the days. The whole time.

1966
02:20:16,160 --> 02:20:18,560
It wasn't the kind of like, oh,
I don't really know that a man.

1967
02:20:18,561 --> 02:20:21,080
I'm hanging over here and they're over
there. It wasn't, it's not like that.

1968
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:24,740
You ever heard of those
dating sites? No. Seriously.

1969
02:20:24,890 --> 02:20:27,410
You put in dot. You look at, okay,

1970
02:20:27,411 --> 02:20:30,230
so I grew up before dating sites or
I got married before dating sites,

1971
02:20:30,231 --> 02:20:33,320
so I was just like,
who do the game back in the day?

1972
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:36,560
Like you got to go to a place where you
can hopefully meet a girl, right? Yeah.

1973
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:41,510
They've odds of meeting a girl are not
the girl that you like and that has some

1974
02:20:41,511 --> 02:20:44,750
sort of remotely similar interests and
you go into a bar over the hundred girls

1975
02:20:44,751 --> 02:20:47,960
in there and like you're lucky if
there's one of them there that's remotely

1976
02:20:47,961 --> 02:20:51,050
interested in what you're
interested in and you can connect.

1977
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:52,850
Then you've got to meet them and you got
to go up and talk to him and all this

1978
02:20:52,851 --> 02:20:53,684
stuff.
It's real hard.

1979
02:20:54,140 --> 02:20:58,540
Then they made the match dating things
online where you put in your stuff. Yeah,

1980
02:20:59,060 --> 02:21:03,350
and then you meet that one person and
you connect with them and you have all

1981
02:21:03,351 --> 02:21:06,260
these things in common. This
situation, you think about it,

1982
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:09,020
you're actually just going into a place
where everyone's into the same thing

1983
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:09,620
that you're going to do.

1984
02:21:09,620 --> 02:21:12,220
It's like walk into a bar and
everyone likes the same stuff there,

1985
02:21:12,650 --> 02:21:16,180
likes Jujitsu and wants to train
and wants to hang out and that's,

1986
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:17,510
that's what makes it cool.

1987
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:21,640
Yeah. Yeah. No, no dating
you typically. But Hey, yeah,

1988
02:21:22,570 --> 02:21:24,190
that's a good point.
It wouldn't kind of,

1989
02:21:24,480 --> 02:21:29,480
you kind of converge on the topic of
Jujitsu and then kind of everything else

1990
02:21:30,221 --> 02:21:32,580
spawns from there. Yeah, totally.
It really seemed like to me,

1991
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:36,480
and then everything spins back to
Jujitsu. Yeah, it was good fun.

1992
02:21:36,481 --> 02:21:41,130
So my input is to go,
that's what I think.

1993
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:44,430
I think go when in doubt
go. It's going, I'm going,

1994
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:49,290
life is going good firms
jps considering he'll go,

1995
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:52,110
he'll probably end up
calling. Yeah. So we'll be,

1996
02:21:52,111 --> 02:21:57,111
it'll be a little ETF reunion
tour of the Zhou sheets.

1997
02:21:58,250 --> 02:22:03,000
Yup. Great. And when you go there
knowing zero people, you'll leave.

1998
02:22:03,001 --> 02:22:05,850
They're not only knowing more people,
but they'll be kind of your friends.

1999
02:22:05,910 --> 02:22:10,600
I will guarantee you'll have more actual
friends after you leave guaranteed to

2000
02:22:10,650 --> 02:22:14,850
the lady that emailed me. That's what
I think that all that, that's cool.

2001
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:17,460
And even if you will
know some people there,

2002
02:22:17,461 --> 02:22:20,850
I say go to because you can
immerse yourself in Jujitsu.

2003
02:22:20,851 --> 02:22:23,700
Best Way to learn and you know,
let's face it, you're in Maine.

2004
02:22:23,701 --> 02:22:28,050
There's a bunch of lobster.
They serve lobster. Yeah.

2005
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:31,170
That was one of the highlights
in my opinion. Anyway. Yeah,

2006
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:35,640
so it is on August 26 through
September 2nd two sessions.

2007
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:39,510
Go to both if you want, but yeah, two
sessions. There you go. All Levels.

2008
02:22:40,060 --> 02:22:45,060
Also for fitness gear going to
[inaudible] dot com slash Jocko they got

2009
02:22:45,151 --> 02:22:49,320
kettlebells, battle ropes, jump ropes,
all kinds of stuff. Good stuff. Very up.

2010
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:50,790
You work out,
get some new gear.

2011
02:22:50,910 --> 02:22:54,180
It'll actually get you more in
the mood to do a workout when you,

2012
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:56,970
when they gear comes in.
I guarantee that. Well,

2013
02:22:56,980 --> 02:22:58,320
I don't know if I can guarantee that,

2014
02:22:58,321 --> 02:23:00,600
but if that's how it was for
me when I got the jump room,

2015
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:04,680
then all of a sudden I'm a jump roper.
It seems sane. It's good. Anyway,

2016
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:07,980
a lot of cool stuff on there. A lot of
good information on there too. By the way.

2017
02:23:08,400 --> 02:23:13,400
If you'd beginning like kettlebells are
you beginning other workout movements

2018
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:16,740
and you want to know some tips and you
know even some nutrition stuff really

2019
02:23:16,741 --> 02:23:20,190
good. Anyway, go there on
it.com/chocolate good way to support.

2020
02:23:20,220 --> 02:23:23,970
Also when you get the books that
Jocko reviews on this podcast,

2021
02:23:23,971 --> 02:23:27,300
I organize them on Jocko
podcast.com on the top.

2022
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:32,750
You click on books from episodes and
it takes you to the page and it has,

2023
02:23:34,770 --> 02:23:35,820
that's right.
You guessed it.

2024
02:23:35,821 --> 02:23:40,650
The books by that was for
four on episodes by episodes.

2025
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:43,620
You see what I'm saying? Anyway,
click on there, takes you to Amazon,

2026
02:23:43,621 --> 02:23:46,800
you can shop and get your books,
get whatever else do you want from Amazon,

2027
02:23:46,920 --> 02:23:51,720
your batteries or duct tape,
whatever. Keep shopping. Do you also,

2028
02:23:52,470 --> 02:23:55,380
good way to support is to subscribe to

2029
02:23:55,950 --> 02:24:00,870
stitcher, iTunes, Google play, Spotify.

2030
02:24:00,871 --> 02:24:04,470
Do you subscribe on Spotify or Arrow?
I've been to Spotify.

2031
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:07,580
There's a lot more apps for podcasts now.
Yeah,

2032
02:24:07,650 --> 02:24:12,180
I think I'm going to explore some of
them to Daily News of comes up daily.

2033
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:15,870
Um, yeah. Well either way, the point
there is little change to their thing.

2034
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:19,500
What do you mean there? There's,
there's there layout or something.

2035
02:24:19,590 --> 02:24:22,650
So now it pops up
different is definitely now

2036
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:29,560
I know, but it's like you ever realize
when, when you the layout of something,

2037
02:24:29,580 --> 02:24:32,350
so this was the big thing on Facebook.
When do you get on Facebook deeper?

2038
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:36,600
Do you remember? 2014
14 Dang, that's, that's,

2039
02:24:36,990 --> 02:24:40,020
that's pretty early environment
for school. Okay. There you go.

2040
02:24:40,260 --> 02:24:45,260
So were you in on Facebook when they kind
of changed the layout of Facebook from

2041
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:49,530
something to something to like newsfeed
negative Jocko Jocko doesn't know

2042
02:24:49,531 --> 02:24:52,920
anything about this. You know what I'm
talking about at all? Huh? No I didn't.

2043
02:24:53,070 --> 02:24:56,250
I didn't get on Facebook troll
to till probably like 2000 I was,

2044
02:24:56,251 --> 02:24:56,971
might've been on,

2045
02:24:56,971 --> 02:25:01,160
but I didn't actively do anything on
it till like maybe a year ago. Yeah,

2046
02:25:01,990 --> 02:25:05,280
maybe a year and a half. So the
layout of Facebook was like, you know,

2047
02:25:05,281 --> 02:25:08,460
you had your profile picture and I even,
I'm just trying to remember what it was.

2048
02:25:08,461 --> 02:25:11,100
It was like, I don't even remember
what it was, but it was like,

2049
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:15,000
I think like your wall or something
like that where it's like you're just,

2050
02:25:15,001 --> 02:25:16,590
you're your own stuff,

2051
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:20,760
and then they all of a sudden switched
it to this newsfeed situation.

2052
02:25:20,790 --> 02:25:24,550
You know how like now it's like everyone's
stuff that you're basically how it is

2053
02:25:24,551 --> 02:25:28,530
now and they just switched it and
people were mad. It was like jade,

2054
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:30,700
like change their life,
you know? They were pissed.

2055
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:34,720
That's what you sounded like when you
just talked about the apples. That's,

2056
02:25:34,980 --> 02:25:37,720
you know, you had that same
effect on your brain. Anyway,

2057
02:25:38,050 --> 02:25:39,640
subscribe to the podcast
is what I'm saying.

2058
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:44,560
Regardless of the layout of any iTunes
or any other applications that the layout

2059
02:25:44,561 --> 02:25:48,910
has or has not changed. Good way to
support also wherever youtube channel.

2060
02:25:48,911 --> 02:25:50,500
So subscribe to that if you want.

2061
02:25:50,550 --> 02:25:53,860
And if you're interested in the
Wii video version of this podcast,

2062
02:25:53,861 --> 02:25:57,700
once you put chocolate looks like, or Dave
Burke in this case, what he looks like.

2063
02:25:57,701 --> 02:25:58,390
Pretty handsome,

2064
02:25:58,390 --> 02:26:03,160
I think as far as handsome
ghosts or Colonel Tom five yes.

2065
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:04,930
See what he looks like.
Yeah.

2066
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:07,310
Typically those are the ones
that people want to see.

2067
02:26:07,311 --> 02:26:09,830
You know they want to see the guests.
I want to see what they look like,

2068
02:26:09,960 --> 02:26:12,910
what we look like. Yeah. It
kind of already know except me.

2069
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:15,550
I guess they don't really know what
I look like cause I still do get,

2070
02:26:15,551 --> 02:26:19,360
hey you don't look like how you sound,
which is an actual thing.

2071
02:26:19,361 --> 02:26:23,770
You can look like how you sound like you
look like how you sound check and the

2072
02:26:23,771 --> 02:26:25,510
same day Burke looks how it sounds,

2073
02:26:26,590 --> 02:26:29,590
but it's not a one to one that's not a
face to like your voice sounds like this.

2074
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:31,890
So your face is gonna look like
it's not like that. It's like your,

2075
02:26:31,891 --> 02:26:33,280
your voice sounds like this.

2076
02:26:34,480 --> 02:26:38,320
So your face can look like this
kind of real like this group,

2077
02:26:38,321 --> 02:26:42,040
this little variety of faith possible
faces as soon what I'm saying,

2078
02:26:42,430 --> 02:26:45,970
that's how it works for you. Your
voice does. I'm outside of that group.

2079
02:26:45,971 --> 02:26:47,980
My face is outside of
that group apparently.

2080
02:26:48,550 --> 02:26:51,920
So if you're interested in that
sort of thing, youtube boom.

2081
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:54,190
Also got the excerpts on
there if you want. You know,

2082
02:26:54,191 --> 02:26:56,830
some of the lessons that chocolate talks
about, you know, you want to share them,

2083
02:26:56,831 --> 02:26:57,260
they're there,

2084
02:26:57,260 --> 02:27:00,820
they're condensed or actually they're
not condensed or just taken out it,

2085
02:27:01,540 --> 02:27:03,880
you know, made little videos on there. Um,

2086
02:27:04,030 --> 02:27:07,030
also enhance excerpts to put
some music on there. Make a more,

2087
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:09,220
somebody asked for tracks,

2088
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:13,480
enhanced excerpt tracks into
psychological warfare available on iTunes.

2089
02:27:14,910 --> 02:27:19,900
Let me, does that make sense? Yeah.
Enhance into an [inaudible] for too,

2090
02:27:19,901 --> 02:27:24,460
by the way. Yeah, I agree. Even a
lot of requests for things like that.

2091
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:25,421
I agree,

2092
02:27:25,421 --> 02:27:29,830
but not from a personal
interest standpoint because
the psychological warfare

2093
02:27:29,831 --> 02:27:34,750
one is still very effective.
100% effective for me,

2094
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:41,260
which I will talk about after I talk
about the fact that Jocko has a store.

2095
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:45,520
It's called Jocko store Taco store.com.
This is where you can get the t shirts,

2096
02:27:45,521 --> 02:27:47,650
let's say discipline equals freedom,
like the one I'm wearing right now,

2097
02:27:47,860 --> 02:27:51,460
or the Jocko podcast shirt basic,
but very nice.

2098
02:27:51,660 --> 02:27:54,790
The one that Dave Burke is
wearing right now also missed.

2099
02:27:54,791 --> 02:27:57,520
Where are you telling me you got called
out with the Jocko podcast tee shirt.

2100
02:27:57,521 --> 02:27:59,110
Where was that?
I'm wearing this exact shirt.

2101
02:27:59,111 --> 02:28:02,950
I'm at Disneyworld with the
family two weeks ago from a cross.

2102
02:28:02,951 --> 02:28:05,110
The way I get a good evening echo,

2103
02:28:05,530 --> 02:28:10,200
that's the standard legit man
standard mode of is good evening echo.

2104
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,750
Very good. Yeah, it looks
good on you. Of course.

2105
02:28:14,140 --> 02:28:16,180
And even if you want the
one that Jocko has on now,

2106
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,340
the one that Jocko
always has on right now,

2107
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:22,520
the one he has on right now and always
has done. You see what I'm saying? Anyway,

2108
02:28:22,521 --> 02:28:23,150
if you want that,

2109
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:27,380
that shirt going Jocko store.com or if
you want a Hoodie or if you want a hat or

2110
02:28:27,381 --> 02:28:31,040
if you want to rash guard anyway,
just go in there. You can see,

2111
02:28:31,041 --> 02:28:33,500
you know if you want to support that way.
There's a lot of cool stuff on there.

2112
02:28:33,501 --> 02:28:38,060
If you want something, get something
that's called Jocko store.com also,

2113
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:43,310
just like Jocko mentioned, psychological
warfare is an album with tracks.

2114
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:48,020
Basically these tracks are each track.
You can get these on iTunes by the way.

2115
02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:51,980
So east track is Jocko telling you how
to get past certain weaknesses that you

2116
02:28:51,981 --> 02:28:52,814
might have,

2117
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:58,010
might have on your
campaign against weakness.

2118
02:28:58,340 --> 02:29:01,340
So you know you're on the path, right?
We're working out, we're waking up early,

2119
02:29:01,341 --> 02:29:05,330
some of us, and you know we're
reading more of whatever we're doing.

2120
02:29:05,331 --> 02:29:07,140
Sometimes you don't want to do that.
You don't do that everyday.

2121
02:29:07,220 --> 02:29:10,490
You just don't feel like it on some days,
but you still should do it.

2122
02:29:10,730 --> 02:29:13,550
We all know that sometimes you don't feel
like it's who you're about to skip the

2123
02:29:13,551 --> 02:29:15,680
workout. Boom, you listened
to a certain track.

2124
02:29:16,100 --> 02:29:18,670
Duck will tell you why you should
skip the workout and it's effective.

2125
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:22,130
You won't skip the workout. Take it
from me. I know 100% from experience.

2126
02:29:22,750 --> 02:29:26,870
It's what it is. Get it on
Itunes, check. You know.

2127
02:29:26,871 --> 02:29:28,520
Also speaking of subscribing,

2128
02:29:29,250 --> 02:29:34,130
I have another podcast now that's
called the warrior kid podcast.

2129
02:29:34,220 --> 02:29:37,550
Good one by the way. Yeah,
Uncle Jake has lessons.

2130
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:40,220
The name of the podcast is where
you're going to ask uncle Jake.

2131
02:29:40,280 --> 02:29:45,280
Uncle Jake answers questions from little
warrior kids around the world and you

2132
02:29:45,651 --> 02:29:49,040
can get that, play it for your
kids. There's no foul language.

2133
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:52,430
There's no talk about
the mee Lai massacre.

2134
02:29:52,610 --> 02:29:56,960
It's totally separate to your kids won't
get a stumble upon something that they

2135
02:29:56,961 --> 02:29:59,300
shouldn't be listening to that
they're not ready for yet.

2136
02:29:59,301 --> 02:30:01,010
So you can check that out.
Also,

2137
02:30:01,011 --> 02:30:06,011
Jocko white tea is available on Amazon
and if you're going to order it will then

2138
02:30:06,231 --> 02:30:11,100
go ahead and just go ahead and order
some more weights for your barbell too,

2139
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:12,050
because you're gonna need them.

2140
02:30:13,130 --> 02:30:17,750
You need about 8,000 pounds worse and
that's a minimum guaranteed dead lift.

2141
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:21,710
Also, there's cans of white tea coming
soon. They're gonna be here in June.

2142
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:26,420
They're going to be available on
Amazon in June. Victory in a can. Yes,

2143
02:30:26,450 --> 02:30:31,210
certified organic. Never thought you'd
hear me say that now. Did Ya? Yeah.

2144
02:30:31,220 --> 02:30:32,770
Certified Organic.
There you go.

2145
02:30:33,740 --> 02:30:38,420
We're going to get rid of all the
horrible energy drinks that are out there

2146
02:30:38,480 --> 02:30:42,710
making people sick and we're going to
place it with Jock, Jocko white tea,

2147
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:46,790
which is 8,000 pounds of pure power.

2148
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:48,770
Let me ask you this about chocolate tea.

2149
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:54,010
Would you consider making the microdose
or a version that doesn't have just a

2150
02:30:54,531 --> 02:30:59,420
micro dose of caffeine? If you
drink the F no, probably not.

2151
02:30:59,510 --> 02:31:01,190
No more caffeine. No. The,

2152
02:31:01,340 --> 02:31:06,340
the Jocko white tea can I think is two
servings and I think it's 30 grams total.

2153
02:31:06,831 --> 02:31:08,750
I'll confirm that. Yeah,
I shouldn't have said it.

2154
02:31:09,190 --> 02:31:11,270
Would you ever consider
making like another,

2155
02:31:11,300 --> 02:31:14,160
another version in the
future or anything like that?

2156
02:31:14,161 --> 02:31:19,090
It's something with more hype person
and more.

2157
02:31:20,430 --> 02:31:23,730
I don't know. I don't think so.
Okay. I don't think so. Cause um,

2158
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:28,560
if you want more you can drink
more or go get something, you know,

2159
02:31:28,590 --> 02:31:32,550
something that's gonna make you
all jittery. That's fine. Uh,

2160
02:31:32,740 --> 02:31:36,870
books away the warrior kid series
to series of books. By the way,

2161
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:42,000
there's two of them right now. There will
be more. I got to, I got an a note on

2162
02:31:43,980 --> 02:31:48,110
social media and it was
from an eight year old war.

2163
02:31:48,111 --> 02:31:52,440
Your kid named Addison and she wrote this,
dear Mr Willink,

2164
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:55,920
I absolutely love your book
way of the Warrior Kid.

2165
02:31:56,130 --> 02:32:00,820
I think it's the best book ever.
You know what I'm saying? Uh,

2166
02:32:00,840 --> 02:32:03,990
it taught me about discipline
and commitment. Now,

2167
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:07,530
every day I trained before school
and trust me, it helps a lot.

2168
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:11,580
Your friend Addison. So there
you go. Listen to Addison,

2169
02:32:11,910 --> 02:32:14,430
pickup the way of the warrior
kid and pickup marks mission,

2170
02:32:14,760 --> 02:32:19,740
the second book so your kids can
get stronger, smarter, faster,

2171
02:32:19,770 --> 02:32:20,603
an overall.

2172
02:32:21,670 --> 02:32:25,890
And if you want to support a particular
warrior kid that's on the move,

2173
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:28,830

Life challenges, struggles, pain,

2246
02:37:23,660 --> 02:37:27,200
suffering on certainty.
Look at the past,

2247
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:31,500
but could a guy like Tom Five,
look what he's been through,

2248
02:37:31,620 --> 02:37:34,080
see what men and women have gone through,

2249
02:37:34,081 --> 02:37:39,081
what they've been subjected to and
how over and over and over again,

2250
02:37:39,390 --> 02:37:43,710
we see human beings that rise
against and they overcome

2251
02:37:46,550 --> 02:37:50,330
to keep putting one foot
in front of the other.

2252
02:37:50,450 --> 02:37:55,370
Keep fighting to move forward
and keep getting after it.

02:37:56,540 --> 02:37:57,220
Okay,

2254
