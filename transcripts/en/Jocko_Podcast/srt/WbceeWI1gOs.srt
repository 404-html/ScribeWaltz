00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,320
This is Jocko podcast number
31 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,010
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,100
Vornado Simpson watched three
men concluding Hutto and
Hudson go into a hut with

4
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:22,941
a girl aged about 17 her
trousers were forcibly removed.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,610
The girls held down
while she was violated.

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,550
Simpson observed this from the door.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,510
Fagan was also part of the girls
or deal when they were finished.

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,840
The helpless captive were shot dead.

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,810
Her face completely blown away.

10
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
Torres stabbed several people with a
Bowie knife and was seen by Hutto raping a

11
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:54,360
girl. She was crying,
fighting, and resisting him.

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,380
Another soldier held her down

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,100
for Simpson. The crucial moment was
when he shot the woman and baby.

14
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,020
Soon after entering the village,

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,830
I went to turn her over and there was
a little baby with her that I had also

16
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:16,710
killed.
The baby's face was half gone.

17
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,950
My mind just went.

18
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,530
The training came to me and I just
started killing old men, women,

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,520
children, water buffaloes, everything.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,120
Yeah,

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,340
we were told to leave nothing standing.

22
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,930
We did what we were told regardless
of whether they were civilians,

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,430
they was the enemy. Period. Kill.

24
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:46,840
If you don't follow a direct order,
you can be shot yourself.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,370
Now what am I supposed to do?

26
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,060
You're damned if you do and
you're damned if you don't.

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,040
You didn't have to look for people
to kill. They were just there.

28
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,050
Okay,

29
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,850
I cut their throats, cut off their hands,
caught out their tongue, their hair,

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,800
scalp them.
I did it.

31
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,520
A lot of people were doing
it and I just followed.

32
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:11,860
I just lost all sense of direction.

33
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,560
I just started killing any kind
of way I can kill. It just came.

34
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,140
I didn't know I had it in me after I
killed the child. My whole mind just went.

35
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,600
It just went and after you start,

36
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,770
it's very easy to keep on.
The hardest is to kill the first time,

37
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,730
but once you kill,

38
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,390
then it becomes easier to kill the next
person and the next one and the next one

39
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,950
because I had no feelings,
no emotion, nothing.

40
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,930
I just killed.
I wasn't the only one that did it.

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,320
A lot of people in the company did it.
Hung them up all types of ways.

42
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,270
Any type of way that
you could kill someone.

43
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,740
That's what they did that day and me lie,

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,190
I was personally responsible
for killing about 25 personally.

45
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,370
I don't think beforehand anyone
thought we would kill so many people.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,280
I mean we're talking
about four to 500 people.

47
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,180
We almost wiped out the whole village,
our whole community.

48
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,610
I can't forget the magnitude of the number
of people that we killed and how they

49
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,950
were killed.
Killed in lots of ways.

50
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,860
Do you realize what it's like killing
500 people in a matter of four or five

51
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:31,150
hours. It's just like the gas
chambers. What Hitler did.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,820
You line up 50 people, women, old
men, children and just mow them down

53
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,320
and that's the way it was from
25 to 50 to 100 just killed.

54
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,750
We rounded him up to
meet a couple of guys,

55
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,770
just put the m 16 on automatic
and just mowed them down.

56
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,110
Good evening, Echo. Good evening.

57
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,163
Well,

58
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,730
that was an excerpt from a book called
four hours and me lie by Michael Bilton

59
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:17,340
and Kevin Sim,

60
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,700
and when I was prepping for this,

61
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,240
I mentioned to a couple people that I
was going to do me lie on the podcast

62
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:33,060
next.
And surprisingly,

63
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,540
a lot of people didn't
know what it was and,

64
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,990
and I thought everybody knew about me.

65
00:04:39,991 --> 00:04:44,760
Lie To me, lie is a war crime.

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,440
It's an atrocity.

67
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,630
And what makes it so hard to talk about
is that it was an atrocity and a war

68
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:58,170
crime that was committed
by American soldiers.

69
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,420
Now,

70
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,420
of course there's people out there that
like to claim that you know that America

71
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:10,900
is this evil imperialistic empire,
which I am killing you.

72
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:14,200
It is not,
not by any stretch.

73
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,150
America isn't any incredibly benevolent
nation with a conscience and a saw that

74
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,790
as a whole

75
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,860
is good in have we done some things
in the past that don't reflect that we

76
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:36,430
absolutely have, but for the most
part, we have stood up for the week.

77
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,460
We have liberated the oppressed.
We defeated the Nazis,

78
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:41,770
we defeated the Imperial Japanese army.

79
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,070
We give aid and military assistance and
education in money to less fortunate

80
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,600
people all over the world all the time.

81
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,820
We are a good nation filled with,

82
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,870
for the most part,
good people,

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,800
but not all good people

84
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,350
and people

85
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,200
inside of people inside of humans.

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,050
There can be something very dark

87
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,380
in some times that darkness can

88
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,370
override the light

89
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,471
in.

90
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:35,471
That is exactly what happened in a small
village in Vietnam called me lie on

91
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:41,450
March 16th,

92
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,780
1968 zero seven 15 in the morning,

93
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,180
a massacre
in atrocity,

94
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,400
the murder of hundreds
and hundreds of old men,

95
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,550
women and children on armed,

96
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,620
begging for mercy,
shot,

97
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,000
stabbed, blown up, raped,

98
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:16,310
tortured, killed, murdered,

99
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,233
and no,

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,080
I don't like talking about this is
specially when it's Americans that are

101
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,780
committing the sin.

102
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,600
When we talk about the Nazis in Germany
and we've talk about the Chechens and

103
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:41,490
garage need,
we talk about the Japanese Shinto in the,

104
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:44,490
in the Malaysian jungle
on the Hutus in Rwanda.

105
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,610
I don't like that,
but this is us.

106
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,023
Okay,

107
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,150
still the question comes,
it came into my mind.

108
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,950
Do I do this?
Do I talk about this?

109
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:09,970
Can I talk about this in the
bottom line is not can I,

110
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,380
but we have to. We have to cover
this. We have to talk about it.

111
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,460
We can't ignore it. We can't deny
it. We have to take ownership of it

112
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,370
to admit it,

113
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,710
to air it out and to keep it in the
front of our minds to ensure that we do

114
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,020
everything we can

115
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,150
to make sure nothing like
this ever happens again.

116
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,520
War is hell

117
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,250
and me lie is the ninth circle of hell,

118
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,830
the part,

119
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:03,110
and let's go there to
make sure we remember

120
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,560
and start by looking at
the path that led there

121
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,230
and in order to look at the path that
led there or we're going to start just by

122
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,260
a little bit of broad strategy because
there's plenty of blame to go around.

123
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,580
And when you look at the broad
strategy in the way it was laid out,

124
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,230
here's a little piece on general
Westmoreland who was running,

125
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,910
running the strategy in Vietnam.

126
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:38,560
General Westmoreland strategy of attrition
also had an important effect on our

127
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:42,100
behavior.
Our mission was not to win.

128
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:46,270
Terrain receives positions,
positions, but simply to kill.

129
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,080
To kill Communist and kill
as many of them as possible.

130
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,880
Stack them up like cordwood
victory was a high body count.

131
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,430
Defeat a low kill ratio
wore a matter of arithmetic.

132
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,250
The pressure on unit commanders to produce
as many corpses was intense and they

133
00:10:07,251 --> 00:10:11,390
in turn communicated it to their troops.
It's not surprising,

134
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:16,391
therefore that some men acquired a
contempt for human life and a predilection

135
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,713
for taking it.

136
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:19,890
Okay,

137
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,460
so that that's, that's the, that's
the environment that you're in,

138
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,630
the environment you're in,
that's being encouraged to kill,

139
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,250
kill as many as possible.
That's coming from the top.

140
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:36,750
That's the broad strategy not
to win this hill. It's kill

141
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,510
and who you talking to and who's
receiving this. Here's a little,

142
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,080
a little piece on Charlie Company,

143
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,340
which is the army unit that this is
based on and that that committed this

144
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,090
atrocity.
We were kids 1819 years old.

145
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,610
I was 21 years old at the time.

146
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,940
I was one of the oldest people
around there among the common grunts.

147
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,330
Most of them had never
been away from home before.

148
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,790
They went into service and
they ended up in Vietnam.

149
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,910
Many of them because they thought they
were going to do something courageous on

150
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,110
behalf of their country.

151
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,750
So young kids and, and
nowadays, if you're young kid,

152
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:21,500
you're 1314 1618 you know,
guess what?

153
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:23,300
You might not have
traveled around the world,

154
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,020
but you've seen the world because you
have television, you have the Internet,

155
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,030
you can see all these parts of the world.

156
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:31,430
You can see all different
cultures and people. Well,

157
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,760
when you're from Iowa in 1967 you,
you,

158
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,920
you, you don't know anything about this.
So you're getting, next thing you know,

159
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,600
six months later you're in Vietnam

160
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,880
and here's a little bit of where you're
going to get your attitude from back to

161
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:55,210
the book to the troops of Charlie company.
Two American troops in general,

162
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:59,620
all Vietnamese were goofs,
dinks, dopes and slopes.

163
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,330
Soldiers who could not find the Vietnamese
who were their enemy soon struck out.

164
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:07,390
Why aren't we at the Vietnamese who
were supposed to be their friends?

165
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,030
How can you tell the enemy?

166
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,240
Varnado Simpson said they all look the
same to which another meal I veteran

167
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:19,480
added in the end.
Everyone in that country was the enemy.

168
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,980
In all wars. It is common for the enemy
to be dehumanized. But in Vietnam,

169
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:29,760
American soldiers also
dehumanize their allies.

170
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,550
Charlie company had not been in Vietnam
long before the pattern of brutality

171
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,480
leading to me.

172
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:41,310
Lie began their own losses and
injuries hastened the process.

173
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,350
Hatred, fear, racism and
revenge turned to beatings,

174
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,870
torture, rape, murder.

175
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,730
All of these offenses were committed
with impunity by individuals and groups

176
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:58,410
from Charlie company. And the weeks
before the massacre finally at me,

177
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:02,520
Eli, they discovered that having
dehumanize the Vietnamese,

178
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,170
they had also dehumanized themselves.

179
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,393
Okay,

180
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,380
so you're going to see this escalation.

181
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,010
And it's just like we
talked about with the,

182
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:20,011
with the Russian soldiers in Chechnya
and how it starts when they don't shave.

183
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,810
Yeah. And then they don't clean their
weapon and they don't stand watch.

184
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:23,580
And then the next thing you know,

185
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,390
they're not doing their duty
and they're being overrun.

186
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,120
You're going to see a similar escalation
here all around lack of discipline.

187
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,180
But it's in a way that they treat
the local populous. And you know,

188
00:13:37,181 --> 00:13:41,260
I had one of my high
school teachers was a,

189
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,830
was a Vietnam veteran and when
I was going to high school,

190
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,590
the movie platoon came out
and,

191
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,890
and you can tell, actually you can
tell that the movie platoon, the La,

192
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,720
the book we did platoon
leader by Jim Mcdonough,

193
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,710
there's so many scenes in that book that
you can tell all of the north read that

194
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,300
book and put some of
those scenes in the movie.

195
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,340
There's no doubt about it because
even a character named Barnes in the,

196
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,040
in the book and in the movie

197
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,980
well platoon also showed,
you know,

198
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,830
a very high,

199
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,700
it portrayed the Americans in a very
rough light in many of the situations.

200
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,250
And when I talked to my, one of my
teachers in high school that wasn't,

201
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,140
was a Vietnam vet. And
he just said, you know,

202
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,870
the thing that they didn't show very
well because they show the guys coming in

203
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:33,130
and in really beaten people,
killing people,

204
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,570
burning villages. And what he
said was, you know, Jocko wheat,

205
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,120
we would walk around the village and
one of our guys would hit a booby trap.

206
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,830
Every day,
every other day,

207
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,010
and the villagers are out there
walking on the same trails,

208
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:51,920
but they're not getting blown up.
And after

209
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,320
weeks and then months of this
happening of me losing two guys,

210
00:14:57,321 --> 00:15:00,950
three guys, six guys getting blown
up, getting killed, losing their legs,

211
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,420
losing their arms, losing their
lives, and the Vietnamese villagers,

212
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:09,890
they're not hitting anything.
Eventually in in our minds,

213
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:10,880
they become guilty.

214
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:11,903
Hmm.

215
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,983
Now,

216
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:19,110
when you have leadership that can
explain and restrain and control,

217
00:15:20,591 --> 00:15:23,560
you can keep that stuff controlled,

218
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,160
but when you have leadership
that buys into that attitude,

219
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,550
you end up in a very bad situation,
which is where we're heading here in Ely.

220
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,573
Hmm.

221
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,130
Now,
back to the strategy.

222
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,870
The aim of American strategy was simple
to kill Vietcong in such large numbers

223
00:15:42,871 --> 00:15:46,170
that they would not be replaced
or could not be replaced,

224
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,730
but how was this to be achieved without
at the same time killing large numbers

225
00:15:50,731 --> 00:15:51,630
of civilians?

226
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,520
This was a problem to which no one on
the American side ever discovered a

227
00:15:56,521 --> 00:16:00,540
satisfactory answer.
It was the biggest failure of the war.

228
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,340
It was a failure magnified enormously
by American strategic thinking.

229
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:10,320
For Westmoreland. Vietnam was a
war of attrition, a meat grinder,

230
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,000
as they called it in the Pentagon.

231
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,370
The object he explained was to bleed
the north to waken in the communist mind

232
00:16:17,371 --> 00:16:21,570
the notion that they were draining their
population to the point of national

233
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:26,571
disaster for generations to
come to achieve this goal
and to win a war in a war

234
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:28,500
of attrition,

235
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,190
Americans had to kill Vietcong fighters
faster than the communists could replace

236
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,220
them as befits a great industrial power.

237
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:38,610
The war was to be fought
on an industrial scale,

238
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,350
Westmoreland like patent before him
intended to construct a killing machine.

239
00:16:43,351 --> 00:16:45,990
So for noble as to be irresistible,

240
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,600
it's sheer size and power would pay
rise the enemy in this submission.

241
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,000
So there you go.
Once again,

242
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,660
it's very clear what the goal
is from a strategic level.

243
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,120
Kill as many as you can.

244
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,930
Yeah,

245
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,470
and this, this kind of spells out
how determined they were to do that.

246
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,250
Back to the book from the beginning
of American involvement involvement.

247
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,420
It'd become common practice for patrols
to call for artillery or narrow strike

248
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:19,270
if they received even
sniper fire from a village,

249
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,270
irrespective of whether
civilians also sheltered there.

250
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,230
By the end of 1966 fighter bombers were
making up to 400 such stories a day

251
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,040
added to be 52 raids in the country.

252
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:38,041
This meant that around 825 tons of bombs
were delivered every day a figure that

253
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:44,710
doubled by the tonnage of high explosive
fired by fired off by artillery.

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,380
The solution in Vietnam,

255
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,710
general debris told the visiting
emissary from the Pentagon is more bombs,

256
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,890
more shells, more napalm till the
other side cracks and gives up,

257
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,470
and that's what they got in 1967 and
article in life magazine claim that the

258
00:18:04,471 --> 00:18:09,471
cost of killing a single
Vietcong guerrilla was $400,000
which included the cost

259
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:12,870
of 75 bombs in 150 artillery shells.

260
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,470
No nation in history had waged a war
with such little regard to expense.

261
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,100
Only days before me, Eli, Robert Mcnamara,

262
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,510
this retiring secretary of defense would
remind an audience gathered to record

263
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:30,960
his farewell from the Pentagon. That
more bombs had been dropped on Vietnam.

264
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,280
Then on the whole of Europe
during the whole of World War Two

265
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,110
so that's just, that's crazy. Especially
for me from my perspective, having,

266
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:49,090
having been in the war in Iraq and having
known guys that fought in Afghanistan,

267
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,960
the this idea that they take sniper
fire from a village and in calling air

268
00:18:55,391 --> 00:18:58,720
strikes on the village is just something
that would not happen. Then you're,

269
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,890
that's why when people,
when people frame America as being this,

270
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:07,891
this power that just goes and crushes
and kills all these civilians,

271
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,980
I know for a fact it's not true. Yes,
obviously it happened in Vietnam,

272
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,970
but we go through great
lengths almost sometimes.

273
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:20,870
I'm telling you almost sometimes absurd
lengths to protect the civilian populace

274
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,030
in Iraq and Afghanistan. I could bring,
I could bring so many people on here,

275
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,420
on this program, just, just
seals. But I could bring any,

276
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,740
anybody from all kinds of diff,

277
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,130
every branch of the military to come
here and say, Oh yeah, here's what we,

278
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:35,200
here's the situation.
My guys were pinned down under fire.

279
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:37,750
We tried to get bombs dropped on
this building. No one would do it.

280
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:40,480
We couldn't do it. We weren't allowed
to do it. Yeah. And, and that's,

281
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,060
that's the reality today.
And you know,

282
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,150
part of that is we've matured as a nation.

283
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:49,460
Obviously we see there that that's
a problem. I mean, I'm not incur.

284
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:51,430
This is the way we should fight.
You know,

285
00:19:51,431 --> 00:19:53,140
sometimes we go too far in one direction.

286
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,360
This was obviously too far
in the other direction.

287
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,583
[inaudible]

288
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,630
in, in Iraq. I remember you
mentioned something about the,

289
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:09,430
the, um, the enemy in Iraq
would use the civilian populace.

290
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,920
Oh, there's no doubt about
it. For like shields.

291
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:15,130
And they literally used
used kids as shields.

292
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,130
They knew our rules of engagement.

293
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,160
They knew that if they stayed in buildings
that were close to a mosque or work

294
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,220
close to a hospital,
that we wouldn't bomb it,

295
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,290
that we wouldn't hit it with with armor.

296
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,410
So they were very smart about how they
took advantage of our rules of engagement

297
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,880
and then we had to adjust our tactics.

298
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,200
So there there's no doubt the enemy
figures out what your rules of engagement

299
00:20:38,201 --> 00:20:42,400
are and then they start to press you in
the seams of that rules of engagement is

300
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,320
try and take advantage of it
to the best of their ability.

301
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,130
Do you think that that that's
kind of an indicator that they

302
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,970
cared about their civilians less
than you cared about their activity,

303
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,770
that that is 100% accurate?
Of course. I mean the,

304
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,270
the Al Qaeda and surgeons
and now the Isis in Iraq,

305
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,570
they don't care about civilian
casualties at all. They don't care.

306
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,690
They literally don't care their own
their own. Well, that's crazy. Yeah.

307
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,820
In the civilians, okay. This is something
that never gets portrayed correctly.

308
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,460
The civilians don't want isis in charge.

309
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,420
The civilians didn't want outside in
charge. They knew what that would lead to.

310
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,450
And yeah, al Qaeda would use
their children as shields.

311
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,510
I mean I literally had snipers of mine
that shot al Qaeda guys carrying machine

312
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:35,890
guns in one hand and a
baby and the other hand.

313
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,640
And luckily we had really
good snipers. Yeah. So

314
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,760
back to the book here, we get to
talk a little bit about the company.

315
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:53,800
The company that this is about Charlie
company and a company is the company

316
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:59,270
soldiers generally around 150
people and you'll have three.

317
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,930
Generally you'll have
three platoons in there.

318
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:05,230
So your platoons are going to be 40,
50, maybe 60 people. Sometimes it's,

319
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,240
it's actually a lot more
flexible than people realize.

320
00:22:07,241 --> 00:22:11,620
Sometimes in already army company we'll
have five platoons but generally three

321
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,390
platoons. What they'll have. So you know,

322
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:17,230
we're talking here probably about 150
guys in Charlie Company and they're guys

323
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,930
they lay out that kind of go into a
quick background of the different guys.

324
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:27,700
And really what it ends up showing you
is a, is a cross section of America.

325
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,770
Uh, some, some highlights, you know,

326
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:34,240
they got a guy named Fred Fred
Whitmere from just north of Pittsburgh.

327
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,250
You got a guy named Kenneth Hodges
from Dublin, Georgia. Um, uh,

328
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:42,310
farmer's boy.
You got a guy from Portland,

329
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:45,760
Oregon named Greg Olsen,
who's, who's a Mormon,

330
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,290
a devout Mormon and,
and you know from a good family,

331
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,250
you got another guy named Harry Stanley
from Gulf Port Mississippi who was

332
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,400
brought up by his mom who believed in
hard work school and Church on Sundays.

333
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,480
So you're looking at a
fairly normal cross section.

334
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,890
Michael Bernhardt came from a middle
class Catholic family from Long Island,

335
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,320
so he got just the,

336
00:23:10,321 --> 00:23:14,890
the troops are just a cross
section and then you get to

337
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:22,050
one of the leaders in Charlie company
in charge of second platoon and his name

338
00:23:23,441 --> 00:23:27,130
was William laws,
Cali lieutenant Calley

339
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,370
and he's going to end up
being are the monster year.

340
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,730
So back to the book,

341
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,790
who was Kelly in the early seventies a
small industry grew up trying to find the

342
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:46,340
answer toilers at this
looked for a monster,

343
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:50,960
but all they found was a nonentity,
a blend young man burdened.

344
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:55,961
It seemed with as much ordinariness as
any single individual could bear and

345
00:23:56,571 --> 00:24:01,220
almost too much of a conventional and
commonplace to retain what is necessary

346
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,900
for human identity.

347
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,650
To press [inaudible] to the press,

348
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:11,540
Kelly was just about as
average in American as ever
came out of the nondescript

349
00:24:11,541 --> 00:24:13,040
middleclass streets of Miami.

350
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,470
He could be any young American.
He was the quiet American.

351
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,970
It was noted with astonishment that he
emerged from a background which most

352
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:27,830
would regard as coming close to
the American ideal. Elsewhere,

353
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:31,910
it was said that his life could have
been lifted from the cover drawing of the

354
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:36,911
old Saturday evening post is averageness
had made him so invisible at one

355
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:41,540
college he attended that all anyone
could remember about him was that he paid

356
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,860
his rent regularly.

357
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,040
The many who combed through his
life found no shred of deviance,

358
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,450
nor even a single distinctive feature
other than his height. Five, four,

359
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,950
five feet, four inches. He'd
come from a stable family.

360
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,070
He'd been neither particularly
popular or unpopular.

361
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,970
He had no particular talents
and few, if any, enthusiasms,

362
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,510
water skiing was the closest he ever
got to violence throughout a long

363
00:25:11,631 --> 00:25:14,690
education.
He'd shown no aptitude for learning.

364
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,410
His college career simply fizzled out

365
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,660
and that's one of the things,

366
00:25:22,661 --> 00:25:27,340
I mean you can see this guy
just is a white your blank
White Brett of just plain,

367
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,920
just plain and that's
what they find about them

368
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,430
now of a company itself.

369
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,350
They say back to the book
Charlie company was very average,

370
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,370
so so Charlie company actually reflects
Cali and the fact that Charlie company

371
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:47,750
as a whole is pretty normal for a
company of army soldiers in Vietnam and

372
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:52,751
investigation ordered by the army chief
of staff in 1970 re revealed that 87% of

373
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:57,680
Charlie company's ncrs or
high school graduates nearly
20% above the army's norm.

374
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,490
Most of the men in Charlie Company
were between 18 and 22 years old.

375
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,230
Nearly half the company was black.

376
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,650
The piers report concluded that there
was little to distinguish Charlie company

377
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:08,180
from other rifle companies.

378
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:12,170
The men were generally representative
of the typical cross section of American

379
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:14,660
youth assigned to most combat
units throughout the army.

380
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,980
They brought with them the diverse traits,
prejudices and attitudes,

381
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:23,180
typical of the various regions of the
country and segments of society from

382
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:24,080
whence they came.

383
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:27,190
Okay.

384
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,180
Normal people.

385
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:34,320
And why it's important to remember that
as we dive into this and as this story

386
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:35,681
develops,

387
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:40,681
you're going to see these normal
people do completely demonic things.

388
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,320
And now we talk a little bit here
about there in Hawaii and they're going

389
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:56,430
through some training to
prepare them for Vietnam.

390
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,820
Back to the book,

391
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,380
what most Charlie Company
veterans remember about the
training was its unreality

392
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,800
and how little it prepared them for
what they had to face in Vietnam.

393
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,080
For Fred Woodmere, it seemed they had
been preparing for World War II or Korea.

394
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,720
Calli thought they could go to Vietnam
and be Audie Murphy's kicking the door,

395
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,930
running the hooch,
give it a good burst kill.

396
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,480
Bernado Simpson said you can't
have no type of training.

397
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,930
Can compare with what war's like none.

398
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,110
There's no such thing as preparedness
for war. We trained and we should,

399
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:40,740
we're so psyched up and they program
you to kill and to go to Vietnam,

400
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,150
you know? But once you get there,
it's a different situation.

401
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,153
Now.

402
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:53,770
I spent my last three years in the
military training guys for Warren. I have,

403
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,890
I'll tell you right now,

404
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,300
we train guys really well for war and the
training that I received preparing for

405
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:03,740
war did a great job and we improved upon
that. The more combat experience we got,

406
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,320
the better we got at training
and preparing guys for war.

407
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,790
But you can see how you could you,

408
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,870
you know how important the training is
and the training has got to be realistic

409
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,910
to the situations you're going
to be put in. And clearly,

410
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,240
you know they them saying that this
was like World War II or Korea.

411
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:24,590
Well in World War II,
Korea,

412
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:26,960
there's vast differences between
what you're dealing with Vietnam.

413
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,780
I mean World War II or Korea,
you're fighting against the enemy.

414
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:34,840
Uniformed troops that are on the other
side of a line that are attacking you,

415
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,811
right?
That's what,

416
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:39,500
that's what world war two and Korea
was very much like for the most part,

417
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:45,010
another person in a different uniform
that you aren't going to fight and kill

418
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,300
and here we just have
something totally different.

419
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,470
People that are mixed in with
the villages, there's no fee.

420
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,910
There's no front line anywhere.
They're dressing the same.

421
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,370
Sometimes they have a gun,
sometimes they don't. It's,

422
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,630
it's an infinitely challenging,
more, more challenging situation.

423
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,370
Now here we go back to the book.
According to Cali,

424
00:29:04,371 --> 00:29:09,260
the only lesson every GI learned
was not to trust anybody.

425
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,860
It was drummed into us.
Be Sharp on guard.

426
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,910
As soon as you think these people
won't kill you, zap in combat,

427
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,340
you haven't friends,
you have enemies.

428
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,660
Over and over again at ocs we
heard this and I told myself,

429
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,780
I'll act as if I'm never secure as if
everyone in Vietnam would do me in as if

430
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,420
everyone is bad.

431
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:34,963
Yeah.

432
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,900
Michael Bernhardt was also concerned.

433
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:39,990
Charlie company did not match up to
the high standards that have order and

434
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:43,060
discipline. He had learned at
the Lasalle military academy.

435
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,190
So this is one of the
soldiers. He had gone to a, uh,

436
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:50,200
a military type high school where they
had good discipline and they learned

437
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:54,460
about the military. And then when he
got in he went to airborne school.

438
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:58,660
So he was more the higher
end soldier back to the book,

439
00:29:58,661 --> 00:29:59,710
trained as a parachute,

440
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,890
as he was disappointed to have been
transferred to a run of the mill infantry

441
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:06,220
company.
Bernhardt was unusual for an enlisted man.

442
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,640
He was a military animal,
a stickler for authority,

443
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,030
and was happiest when things
were being done by the book.

444
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,930
But it was not this system
that bar bothered Bernhardt.

445
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,700
He believed that good soldiers
not only needed discipline,

446
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:30,080
but liked it. It was the lax
discipline in Charlie company.

447
00:30:30,081 --> 00:30:33,620
And the fact that officers did not always
insist on their orders being carried

448
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:36,680
are out that worried him
in an argument with Kelly.

449
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,420
Shortly after arriving in Hawaii,

450
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,220
he found the young lieutenant callow
and lacking in leadership qualities.

451
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,130
So right now we're already seeing some,

452
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,850
some chinks in the armor
of lieutenant Calley.

453
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:55,500
And if you remember what
Hackworth said about, about me,

454
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,343
Eli,

455
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:00,780
he talked about Kelly and
he said that Kelly had been

456
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,453
uh,

457
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,220
kicked out or failed.

458
00:31:05,221 --> 00:31:09,720
He'd failed officer candidate school
three times and they just wanted to, hey,

459
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:13,020
we need more guys. We need to have
better numbers getting through.

460
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:17,310
Go ahead and pass the guy. So you've got
a guy that lacks leadership and it is,

461
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,100
I mean it's interesting the talk
about how bland this guy is.

462
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,370
I mean somebody that's that bland
that they literally have nothing,

463
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,540
no characteristics.

464
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:28,050
Obviously the guy lacked some leadership
characteristics as well because he has

465
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:32,610
no characteristics and now you've got
the young soldiers looking at the guy and

466
00:31:32,611 --> 00:31:36,450
thinking he doesn't have,
he doesn't have any leadership.

467
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,230
And this is a, this is a part that
I highlighted because I think it's,

468
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,090
it's an interesting perspective of
what it was like to go to Vietnam.

469
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,370
Back to the book, we flew over on
a Kent Continental Airlines plane,

470
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,930
Fred Whitmere recalls.
It was a weird situation,

471
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,870
a civilian plane with a
civilian stewardess and crew.

472
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:02,400
They were flying both ways.
They were flying people out as well as in,

473
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,560
so they got to see both ends.

474
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,490
I remember getting off the plane and
the stewardess just stood there crying.

475
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:09,450
As we unloaded,

476
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,620
they were more attuned to what we
were getting into than we were.

477
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,760
That's pretty surreal.

478
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,883
Now

479
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,690
they start talking about what it's like
there and what they're doing and there's

480
00:32:33,321 --> 00:32:37,220
a, there's a province, they're that they,

481
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,980
they're to concentrate on

482
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,760
a province in Vietnam and some of the
problems that they have there in a

483
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:47,430
province deemed correctly to be
overwhelmingly sympathetic to Vietcong.

484
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,110
This meant eliminating the countryside.
The villages were bombed,

485
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,180
burned down and pull verist.

486
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,140
Sometimes villagers would be warned in
advance that their homes were about to be

487
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,530
wiped off the face of the earth,
sometimes not.

488
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,990
It was common practice to shell or bomb
any village from which the US soldiers

489
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:09,590
had taken any fire, even small
arms without any warning at all.

490
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:15,770
The destruction was on an almost
unimaginable scale. So again,

491
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,630
is this something that in the wars that I
fought in, that we would, this is on we,

492
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,610
we would never do that.
It wasn't just like, oh,

493
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:26,690
we took rifle fire from a village bomb.
The whole thing that was not happening.

494
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:34,230
This was the reality behind Westmoreland's
prediction in 1965 that the war will

495
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:37,110
bring about a moment of
decision for the peasant farmer.

496
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:41,670
He will have to choose if he stays alive.

497
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,620
American officials frequently referred
to this choice. The choice is yours.

498
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:48,690
One leaflet dropped on
villages proclaimed.

499
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:53,730
If you refuse to let Vietcong use your
villages and hamlets as their battlefield,

500
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:58,700
your homes and lives will be spared.
1 million leaflets,

501
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:03,701
leaflets a day were being dropped on
quieting province [inaudible] province at

502
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:05,094
this time.

503
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:10,520
The whole exercise assumed that the
largely illiterate peasants could actually

504
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:16,041
read them from 1965 to 1970 to 50 billion
leaflets were dropped over Vietnam,

505
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,740
1500 each for every
member of the population.

506
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,083
So

507
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:29,710
that's just w when you think about we're
dropping these leaflets to tell the

508
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:31,410
people what to do and,
and most of the popular,

509
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,110
a lot of the population is illiterate.
Hey, get out of your village. Well,

510
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,660
there's a piece of paper flying from
the sky and I don't know what it says.

511
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,743
Yeah.

512
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:45,550
Back to the book to stay and be killed
or to go join thousands of other refugees

513
00:34:45,551 --> 00:34:49,630
in the squalor of refugee camps or the
mushrooming shanty towns around the towns

514
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,090
and cities.
What kind of a choice was this?

515
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:55,350
But for the Americans,

516
00:34:55,351 --> 00:35:00,351
the whole point of clearing an area of
countryside of its people was so that

517
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:03,510
anyone who remained must be Viet Cong.

518
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:06,540
These areas became free fire zones.

519
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,680
Anything that happened to someone who
chose to remain in or return to a free

520
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:14,850
fire zone was their own fault.
They could expect the worst.

521
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,890
The belief that people had been given a
chance to get out, had made their choice,

522
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,450
made the strategy morally
workable in a free fire zone.

523
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:28,680
The pursuit of a high body count could
proceed unencumbered by the need to

524
00:35:28,681 --> 00:35:32,310
discriminate between combatants
and civilians at all.

525
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,630
Nowhere was this Brit breathtaking
carelessness of human life greater than in

526
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,633
night.

527
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,700
No one was actually saying kill civilians,

528
00:35:45,701 --> 00:35:49,750
but no one's strive to keep them alive
because the killing of civilians came to

529
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:51,220
be seen as unavoidable.

530
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:55,930
Less and less time was spent on seeing
how it could be avoided to American

531
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:56,764
spokesman,

532
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:01,600
the death or injury of noncombatants
who was always accidental and inevitable

533
00:36:01,601 --> 00:36:06,160
tragedy of war and therefore
somehow uncorrectable

534
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,130
me. What do you eat? You do. It doesn't
take a genius to figure this out.

535
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,890
When did the Americans are bombing
your village and they're killing your,

536
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:25,360
your son, your husband, your
wife, whatever. I mean at what,

537
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,460
whose side are you going to be
on? You know, it's, and we know,

538
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:31,050
we know that the VC were brutal.

539
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,710
We'll look at the end of platoon commander
when the VC come in and murder the

540
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,130
half the village or three quarters the
village and burned down their huts and

541
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:41,060
blow up all their, all their
hooches. We know that the VC,

542
00:36:41,061 --> 00:36:44,040
you were capable and and evil,

543
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:50,590
but when our strategy is,

544
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:54,410
hey, give him a quick warning, drop some
leaflets, tell them if they stay there,

545
00:36:54,411 --> 00:36:57,950
they're VC. And if not, hey, we gave him
a chance. So if they're standing there,

546
00:36:57,951 --> 00:36:58,790
there must be VC.

547
00:36:59,110 --> 00:36:59,943
Hmm.

548
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:07,580
Charlie company's spent December guarding
bridges and practicing in the deserted

549
00:37:07,581 --> 00:37:08,930
village of Duke foe.

550
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:14,830
The army called it in country orientation
and Australian advisor was brought

551
00:37:15,351 --> 00:37:19,430
into instruct the company on
how to distinguish between
noncombatants, Viet Cong,

552
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:24,320
regular suspects and sympathizers.
He said it was very difficult.

553
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,100
So did other instructors from
the South Vietnamese army,

554
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,270
they got the same story
from former Viet Cong.

555
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,540
The Australian emphasize that you
should be extremely leery of children.

556
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,380
Medina testified later in
Medina is the company commander.

557
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,390
So the company has three platoons in it,

558
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,740
the overall in charge of the company's
guy named Medina. Now think about this,

559
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:54,050
not only, you're just
distinguishing between good and
bad. You got noncombatants,

560
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:56,720
which are, you know, friendly
civilians, Vietcong, regulars,

561
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,390
suspects and sympathizers.

562
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,520
And now you've got the Vietnamese
soldiers who are from Vietnam.

563
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,240
Obviously they're saying how hard
it is to distinguish who's who.

564
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,100
And then the Viet Cong,

565
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:15,130
the captured Viet cong themselves are
saying that it's very difficult to know

566
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:16,154
who's who.

567
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,560
So how is a kid from Iowa going
to be able to tell the difference?

568
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,080
We will expose to something
that went far beyond the world.

569
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,100
As we knew it said Fred Whitmere. We
had just left Hawaii with all its hotels

570
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:40,750
and nightclubs and bars and we wound up
in Vietnam where people went right out

571
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:44,290
and shit and the rice patty in the
morning drop their drawers right along the

572
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,340
trail at any time.

573
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,930
It was hard to consider people in the
modern day and age living like they did.

574
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,220
I think it would against our
value of what human life is.

575
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,810
Kelly was always frustrated
in his attempts to keep
the children away from his

576
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:04,330
men when they were guarding
bridges at duck foe,

577
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,180
all the men love them, gave the
kits, candies, cookies, chewing gum,

578
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,410
everything he said later,
not me, I hated them.

579
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,330
I was afraid of the Vietnamese kids.
So you know,

580
00:39:19,331 --> 00:39:22,060
you've got the Australian guy saying,
hey, look, be leery of the kids.

581
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,350
You got the kid from Iowa, the normal
American grunt. He loves the kids,

582
00:39:26,351 --> 00:39:30,100
he's good and he's giving them gum. He's
giving them food, playing with them.

583
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,040
It's all good. Meanwhile, Cali, again,

584
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:35,950
you start seeing the indicators
of what's about to take place.

585
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:40,480
You got a guy that's saying I hated them,
I hated them.

586
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:45,520
It's hard to develop hatred for
it. For a kid, for a five year old.

587
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,613
Nope.

588
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,330
Now they,
they become part of a,

589
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,000
a unit that's called Task Force Barker,

590
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,540
which is a multiple companies
of which Charlie companies,

591
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,260
one of them. And, and this lieutenant
colonel, look, battalion commander,

592
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,100
he is the, he is the commander of
this task force and they actually,

593
00:40:11,101 --> 00:40:12,300
his name is Colonel Frank Barker.

594
00:40:12,301 --> 00:40:17,301
So they named the task force after
him and they send them up to this,

595
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:23,040
to this province.
Now inside there,

596
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,080
back to the book,
inside their fire bases,

597
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,250
men of 10 men of the task force enjoyed
as much of the American world as could

598
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:34,230
be flown in by helicopter. They received
their mail, American newspapers,

599
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,110
Cold Beers, steaks, ice cream,

600
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,660
Coca Cola and playboy magazine.

601
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,810
But all around them was
the world of the Viet Cong.

602
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,200
And I got another, uh, another
interesting thing from this book just to,

603
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:54,580
just to show the extent that
they, that they did this, there's,

604
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:59,660
there was 40 ice cream plants built in
Vietnam to supply the troops with ice

605
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:06,060
cream, the and, and each Bu. Another
figure that I read was that each,

606
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,040
each person in each
soldier in Vietnam used uh,

607
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:14,820
a hundred pounds of supplies at day.
Crazy.

608
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:20,263
Okay.

609
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,730
Now the guys,
they move into this new projects,

610
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,760
province Quain NY and they
start to encounter some combat

611
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,000
and I'm very careful to say
they're not encountering,

612
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,220
they're not really encountering VC,

613
00:41:39,221 --> 00:41:43,240
they're not getting an a
bunch of firefights but
they are getting in some and

614
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:46,030
this is there,
they're in their first fire fight in here.

615
00:41:46,031 --> 00:41:49,010
We go back to the book of the
men in their first firefight.

616
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,030
We're discovering things about
each other and about themselves.

617
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,130
Greg Olson recalled we were pinned
down in a trench taking a lot of fire.

618
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,170
Sergeant Cowan was on one side,

619
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,770
one side of me putting up his helmet
to get some bullet holes in it.

620
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,980
Almost like it was a
music on the other side.

621
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,340
There was this other guy just
sobbing. He'd come on, glued,

622
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,840
crawling around like a dog.
Just lost it.

623
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:18,290
The first platoon withdrew under cover
of massive artillery bombardment.

624
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,860
According to some of the men,
Kelly was totally lost.

625
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,180
He led them back towards the river.
As they broke cover,

626
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,710
the snipers started up again.

627
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,670
Ron Weber Kelly's radio
operator took a shot,

628
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,490
which shattered his radio
set and tore his kidney out.

629
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,280
He died a few moments later.
Charlie company's first killed in action.

630
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,470
His horrified companions lifted him
onto the Hovering Med evac helicopter,

631
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,320
a Gi and shock blubbered and how old,

632
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,330
no one had known much about shock before.
If we got hit much harder,

633
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:56,060
we would all go into shock.
Cali told his count,

634
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:59,840
his court martial nearly three
years later. It was terrifying,

635
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,070
a terrifying experience.
In later years,

636
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:08,690
Kelly admitted that he'd been careless.
He led his men into an exposed position,

637
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:13,370
so they're in a firefight and they're
trying to break contact and Cali leads a

638
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:15,800
mountain to an open area and
gets one of his guys killed.

639
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,340
And then he asked to report back.
He got in a firefight. Okay, look,

640
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,550
how'd it go? Let's report back.
What's the body count? Cause that,

641
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,560
remember this is all about killing
is all about killing. Yeah,

642
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,470
and so he passes up the body count and
here's how he comes up with his body

643
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:39,460
count.
Ask later how he arrived at a body count.

644
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,510
Kelly had replied, you just make an
estimate off the top of your head.

645
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:48,400
There is no way to really figure out
exact body count. As long as it was high,

646
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,230
that's all they wanted.
I generally knew that if I lost a troop,

647
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,480
I better come back with a body count of
10 say I shot at least 10 of the enemy,

648
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,080
which was pretty hard when
you're only fighting one sniper,

649
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,980
so you've got these guys out in
the field and they're reporting,

650
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:08,290
they're just making up the body count.
Now think about what,

651
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:11,810
how the what the effect is house
on the war effort because General

652
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:13,330
Westmoreland's up there saying,
hey,

653
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:15,220
we're going to kill them until
they can't take it anymore.

654
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:18,040
Well guess how many people they killed,
right there is zero.

655
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:23,190
They didn't kill that sniper
and yet they're reporting
that they killed 10 well,

656
00:44:23,591 --> 00:44:27,820
you multiply that over the whole country
and every unit that's out there that's

657
00:44:27,821 --> 00:44:30,460
making up these body count
numbers and guess what?

658
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:33,900
Eventually Westmoreland thinks we're
doing a good job and killing a lot of bad

659
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,190
guys,
but we're not killing nanny.

660
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:36,683
Yup.

661
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,320
Yeah. And that can jam you up when you
have that like you in a different type of

662
00:44:41,321 --> 00:44:46,321
scenario where you're getting reports
on a certain level of progress and

663
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:48,130
therefore a lot of times the decision,

664
00:44:48,131 --> 00:44:53,131
the next decisions to be made are based
on that oh 100% 80 any situation that

665
00:44:53,501 --> 00:44:54,334
you're in,

666
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,780
if you've got your troopers and your
subordinate leadership with a mindset that

667
00:44:58,781 --> 00:45:02,650
they would rather lie to you, then tell
you the truth about what's happening.

668
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:03,011
You're not,

669
00:45:03,011 --> 00:45:05,290
you're never gonna be able to make good
decisions because you're making your

670
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:06,820
decisions based on lies.
Yup.

671
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,453
Yeah.

672
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,220
Back to the book, frustration and anger
ate away at the company's a spree decor.

673
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,170
The men stopped believing that
Charlie Kong, meaning the Vietcong,

674
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,360
was afraid of Charlie
company faith in Medina,

675
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,160
the company commander was still high,

676
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:29,040
although some Gis felt he
pushed the company to hard.

677
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,560
Cali was another matter.

678
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,340
Opinion on him was universally hostile
according to one GI and his platoon Kelly

679
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,590
was a glory hungry person.

680
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,310
The kind of person who would have
sacrificed all of us for his own personal

681
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:46,830
advancement.
John Smale,

682
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,920
our squad leader in third
platoon called him a nervous,

683
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:52,140
excitable type who yelled a lot.

684
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,800
I think it's important for you to know,

685
00:45:55,801 --> 00:46:00,801
smelled talk told the army cid that Cali
was so disliked by members of the unit

686
00:46:01,381 --> 00:46:02,940
that they put a bounty on his head.

687
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,390
None of the men had any respect
for him as a military leader.

688
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,240
Greg Olson thought he was incompetent.

689
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,810
I remember instances that we
were lost one time at night.

690
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:16,260
Everyone knew we were lost,
but Calli wouldn't admit it.

691
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:22,160
So there you go. You got a guy, we talk
about this all the time. It's like, oh,

692
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:25,790
what do you do if you make a mistake,
you own the mistake. If you need help,

693
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,970
you say, Hey, you know what? I'm not sure
we were on the map right now. Let me get,

694
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,920
let me get someone up here and
do a map study helped me out.

695
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,850
Let's figure out where we are, but
instead he just lies. He doesn't admit it,

696
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:39,050
he doesn't own it, and no one is
going to have respect for them.

697
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,561
Back to the book,

698
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:46,300
someone else thought Kelly acted like a
small guy who had been pushed around a

699
00:46:46,301 --> 00:46:48,940
lot by bigger people
before he joined the army.

700
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,990
Now that he had a 40 he didn't know
how to use it and he didn't listen to

701
00:46:52,991 --> 00:46:57,520
suggestions. We, I talk
about this all the time.

702
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,440
If you're in a leadership position,

703
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:02,410
you need to listen to your people
up and down the chain of command.

704
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:05,500
This is one of the main thing that he's
getting called out on it, doesn't it?

705
00:47:05,501 --> 00:47:08,170
But when he's wrong and
doesn't listen to suggestions,

706
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,640
many commented that there was something
about him that rubbed people the wrong

707
00:47:12,641 --> 00:47:14,050
way.
Medina,

708
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,830
the company commander gave his junior
lieutenant a tough time and ridiculed him

709
00:47:17,831 --> 00:47:18,790
in front of his men.

710
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,710
The captain called him
lieutenant shithead regularly.

711
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:28,860
One Gi remembered that tended to minimize
your opinion of him are get recalled.

712
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:33,400
Others recalled that Kelly's attempt to
win flavor with Medina were frequently

713
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:36,160
rebuffed with a sarcastic
listen sweetheart.

714
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,860
So now we have another situation where
you have a subordinate leader that's not

715
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:44,890
doing a good job.
He's not being a good leader.

716
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:47,440
People don't respect him and what his,
what is his superior,

717
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:50,410
don't undermining them in front of
his troops instead of counseling.

718
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,930
And instead of helping them set up,
pulling them aside and say, hey,

719
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,670
it's okay to admit when you're wrong.
Hey,

720
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,410
you need to take
suggestions from your guys'.

721
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,210
Instead he's calling them a
shithead lieutenant shithead
undermining him all the

722
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,420
time. So now you got, you get put
in Cali need even worse position.

723
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:05,563
Hmm.

724
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,160
Now
they continue to patrol.

725
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,190
They're starting to take some casualties
and they start to go down the spiral.

726
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:20,530
Okay.

727
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:24,730
Back to the book. Charlie company's drift
toward brutality. Took very little time.

728
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,460
It began with beating up suspects in
villages and quickly became more serious.

729
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:35,200
Bernhardt state aloof from the process.
Fred Woodmere did not.

730
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,400
They had explained that Geneva Convention
to us during our training and in the

731
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:43,210
beginning we did what we thought was
right and just turn a prisoners over.

732
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,530
But it was kind of hard after you'd been
there a while and you started seeing

733
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,450
learning, finding out what
real experience is all about.

734
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,950
Here you are fighting an enemy who
doesn't follow the Geneva Convention,

735
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:01,220
but you have to abide by it. It's like
being at a football team where you don't,

736
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,210
where you have to follow the rules to
the letter and the other team can do

737
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:07,990
whatever the hell they like.
The voices of authority in the company,

738
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:13,110
the platoon sergeants and officers
acknowledged that this executing prisoners

739
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,180
was a proper way to behave.
Who were the grunts to disagree with it?

740
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,040
We supported it.
So

741
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,680
they've started to execute prisoners,

742
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,200
which is obviously against
the Geneva Convention,

743
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,140
but the way they're looking at it,
they're seeing that the sergeants and the,

744
00:49:31,141 --> 00:49:35,850
and the platoon commanders are like,
okay with it. So the grunts, okay,

745
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,260
I guess that's the way it's going to be.

746
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,273
Hmm.

747
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,760
And we'd mirror goes on to say the first
time I saw something really bad was the

748
00:49:44,761 --> 00:49:47,370
point at which we
stopped taking prisoners.

749
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,440
We'd been there about a month and a half
or maybe two months. There was one guy,

750
00:49:52,441 --> 00:49:56,580
Medina had shoot the prisoners. Instead
of having everyone around and shoot them,

751
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,320
we would walk them down towards the,

752
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,430
they would walk them down towards the
beach or behind some sand dunes and shoot

753
00:50:02,431 --> 00:50:07,020
them a couple of shots and they were done.
As time went by,

754
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,710
things were done, ears
cut off, mutilation.

755
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:16,050
One prisoner had his arms tied
straight out on a stick. One woman was,

756
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,960
one was a woman and one was a man.

757
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:22,020
There was no question that
these two were Vietcong.

758
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,920
The woman was working as a nurse and
we found them in a tunnel with all the

759
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:28,100
medical supplies and we
knew they were the enemy.

760
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:33,830
Lit cigarettes were put inside the elastic
of the guy's pants and we watched him

761
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,020
dance around because they
were burning his ass.

762
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:38,090
Okay.

763
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:41,930
I think it was a bit of making him talk
in a bit of venting our frustrations.

764
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:45,170
A bit of both.
I don't remember what happened to them,

765
00:50:45,171 --> 00:50:46,940
whether they were turned over or shot.

766
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,700
The more it went on,
the more you didn't trust anyone.

767
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,520
You didn't believe anybody because
you didn't know who was who.

768
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,390
You didn't know who the
enemy was as we went on.

769
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:00,730
Yeah.

770
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,610
More and more prisoners.
Prisoners would be executed.

771
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:08,590
I would say it was a regular occurrence.
I did abuse someone, a prisoner,

772
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,490
a Papasan.

773
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,660
I found myself doing the same things
that had been going on all along.

774
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,790
I found myself caught up in it. We
caught his beard off. That was an insult.

775
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,810
A Papasan with a beard is considered as
the wise man had to cut off their beard

776
00:51:22,811 --> 00:51:27,490
was a real sign of disrespect to them.
You found yourself punching them around,

777
00:51:27,491 --> 00:51:32,140
beating them up, trying to get them to
talk. I never did hit anyone with a rifle.

778
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,900
I've taken a knife to them.
I never tortured anyone to death.

779
00:51:37,170 --> 00:51:39,840
I think I probably saw
people tortured to death.

780
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,120
So you hear this guy using this verbiage,
you find yourself punching them around.

781
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,070
It's almost as if it's not, it's not him.
He's detailed. He's like detached. Yup.

782
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,760
Right. We talk about being detached. Well,

783
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:53,730
he's detached from doing something that
he knows he shouldn't be doing. Yeah.

784
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,940
It seems like he comes back and kind
of checks back in every once in awhile.

785
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,600
It's like, Dang. I kind of woke up
and found myself doing this thing.

786
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:05,970
Bernhardt and outsider as usual,
watch the downward spiral.

787
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,380
It started with just plain prisoners.
Prisoners you thought were the enemy.

788
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,320
Then you'd go onto prisoners who
weren't the enemy and then the civilians

789
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:18,560
because there was no difference
between the enemy and civilians.

790
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:22,400
It came to a point where
a guy could kill anybody

791
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,670
during an interrogation.
In one village,

792
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:31,170
here we Stanley was standing only 10
feet away while the Cali and another Gi

793
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:34,050
Herbert Carter interrogated
and old farmer.

794
00:52:35,130 --> 00:52:38,670
Lieutenant Calley asked some questions
and then Carter hit the old man in the

795
00:52:38,671 --> 00:52:42,720
mouth twice with his fist.
Then Carter push the old man into a well,

796
00:52:42,721 --> 00:52:47,010
but the old man spread his legs and arms
and held on and didn't fall into the

797
00:52:47,011 --> 00:52:50,910
well. Then Carter hit the old man
in the stomach with his rifle stock.

798
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,760
The old man fell.
The old man's feet fell into the well,

799
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,560
but he was holding on with his hands.

800
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:59,190
Carter hit demands fingers trying
to make him fall into the well.

801
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,840
Then lieutenant Calley
shot the man with Zim. 16

802
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,000
for some Gis instance like these showed
that the official attitude to brutality

803
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:15,540
was permissive.
What resulted was a moral vacuum,

804
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,310
a moratorium on restraint
and self control.

805
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,690
Common decency became optional.

806
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:27,230
A matter of personal inclination even
who refuse to be drawn in were left,

807
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,940
left Morley,
thrown off balance.

808
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:34,950
Greg Olson was in the village when Crowley
and Carter through the old man down

809
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:37,170
the well,
I was in the village.

810
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,560
I remember seeing people
butted in the head with rifles,

811
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,760
but you start losing your sense of what's
normal. You don't give up your morals,

812
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:46,830
but you become a lot more tolerant.

813
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,010
We believe this behavior
was pretty common place.

814
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:53,250
I didn't think we were doing anything
different from any other unit.

815
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,150
You really do lose your
sense not of right and wrong,

816
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,090
but your degree of white right and wrong

817
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:07,130
and Michael Bernhardt who watched what
was happening from the sidelines was

818
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:11,750
already viewed with some mistrust by
Medina Kelly and others in the company.

819
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:17,030
When I saw American soldiers committing
acts that could be called atrocities if

820
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:17,960
someone else had done them.

821
00:54:17,961 --> 00:54:21,200
I began to think that maybe I
just been too naive all my life,

822
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,070
that this is the way things really were.
Little by little,

823
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:28,910
I began to see that this group of
men was getting out of control.

824
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:33,080
Discipline was beginning to wear
off without military discipline.

825
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,400
They were alone in the country
with no point of reference.

826
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,450
The things they had brought from their
families and schools were far away and

827
00:54:41,451 --> 00:54:45,160
beginning to disappear.
Fred,

828
00:54:45,161 --> 00:54:50,161
Weird Mirror felt Fred Woodmere to felt
things going from bad to worse and felt

829
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:53,110
himself drawn along with the tide.

830
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,980
If it ever occurred to me that things
were getting out of hand or that I was

831
00:54:56,981 --> 00:55:00,640
questioning what I myself might be
capable of doing, I suppressed it.

832
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:05,470
It did creep up in my mind because you
still have those values of what is right

833
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:08,230
and what is wrong that you
have been taught all your life.

834
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,840
I think the frustration got to me,
but I also think I began to enjoy it.

835
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,400
That's what's scary because at the
time you find yourself enjoying it.

836
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,480
I guess you could term it this
superiority we had over them.

837
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:25,450
It's a strange feeling.
In retrospect.

838
00:55:25,451 --> 00:55:30,451
You look back on it and wonder how you
yourself could have done it 20 years

839
00:55:30,521 --> 00:55:34,330
later. When you look back at things
that happened, things that transpired,

840
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:37,600
things you did. You say,
why? Why did I do that?

841
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:41,080
That is not me.
Something happened to me.

842
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:46,480
You reach a point over there where you
snap. That's the easiest way to put it.

843
00:55:46,481 --> 00:55:47,680
You finally snap.

844
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:52,300
Somebody flicks a switch and you
are completely different person.

845
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,240
There's a culture of violence,

846
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,350
of brutality with people all
around you doing the same thing.

847
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:10,680
Continuing down the spiral.
Leonard to Gonzales,

848
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:14,160
a member of second platoon
SAR rapes committed.

849
00:56:14,161 --> 00:56:16,590
Every time the company
went through a village,

850
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:19,490
okay,
one

851
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:24,160
squad got one girl, one
lady. Then they told me, go

852
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,930
in there and I said,
no I won't.

853
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:29,950
So what I did is I went inside
and she looked real bad.

854
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:35,320
The only thing I can do for the lady is
like, I got the canteen and I wiped her.

855
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:40,180
She was awful for spiring. I wiped
her forehead. I tried to help her.

856
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,550
She got scared of me.
I was part of them.

857
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,510
I tried to tell her I don't have nothing
to do with it. I helped her to her feet.

858
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,630
I took her to the, well, I
got some water from the well.

859
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,950
Then another squad heard about 13 guys
who did their thing with this woman and

860
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:00,520
we're going to try her out.
And I told them to leave her alone.

861
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,870
And then at that time I just
walked off. I said, forget it.

862
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:10,210
I don't want to kill my own men. I
tried to tell her, get out of here.

863
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,180
Go.
She was going to run.

864
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,440
But after 13 guys got to her,

865
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,750
it's hard to walk.

866
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,990
They're losing it.
There's no leadership.

867
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,143
They're losing it.

868
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,080
Now the get into a,
they get,

869
00:57:44,081 --> 00:57:49,081
they get in a minefield and they take
some casualties into mind field and here's

870
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:53,380
Medina's account of what
happened in this mine field.

871
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,730
We started sweeping the area as
best we could with mine detectors,

872
00:57:57,731 --> 00:58:00,700
taking pieces of toilet paper and
marking the minds that we found.

873
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:04,930
We had one individual that we
could not evacuate that was dead.

874
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:06,790
I took the medic that was with me,

875
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,200
the platoon medic from first platoon
and he and I moved to the minefield to

876
00:58:11,201 --> 00:58:12,460
where an individual was lying.

877
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:17,260
He was split as if somebody had taken a
cleaver and write up from his crotch all

878
00:58:17,261 --> 00:58:21,040
the way up to his chest cavity.
I had never seen anything like it.

879
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,090
That looks so unreal in my entire
life. The intestines, the liver,

880
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,910
and the stomach and the blood
just looked like plastic.

881
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,460
We took a Poncho and we spread it out
and started and the and the medic started

882
00:58:33,461 --> 00:58:34,960
to pick them up by the legs.

883
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:38,620
I reached underneath his arms to place
him under the Poncho and we set them on

884
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:42,580
top of another mine.
The concussion blew me back.

885
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,010
I fell backward. As I got up the martyr,
the medic was starting to go to pieces.

886
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:54,030
I looked at him as if he had stood behind
the screen and somebody had taken a

887
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:57,820
paintbrush with red paint and
splattered it through the screen.

888
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,740
He had blood all over him.

889
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,000
I grabbed him as he started to pass
me and I shook him and I said, my God,

890
00:59:04,001 --> 00:59:06,730
don't go to pieces on me.
You're the only medic I've got.

891
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,890
I have these people that are
hurt. I hit him. I slapped him.

892
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:16,570
I knocked him to the ground and I helped
him to get back up and I saw on his

893
00:59:16,571 --> 00:59:18,550
religious metal a piece of liver

894
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:22,520
and I tried to get it off the individual

895
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,780
before he seen it.
The individual was very shook up.

896
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:28,960
Yeah.

897
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,330
Everybody was shaking.
The three men were dead.

898
00:59:31,331 --> 00:59:34,060
Another 12 suffered ghastly injuries.

899
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:39,130
Few could forget their own fear or the
screams of the wounded or the gruesome

900
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:41,680
task of loading the medivac helicopters.

901
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:46,270
When you've been through a minefield and
put the remains of your friends in body

902
00:59:46,271 --> 00:59:48,730
bags,
nothing shocks you anymore.

903
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:52,660
So that mind field

904
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:59,550
costs some three dead and
12 severely wounded in,

905
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,520
we talk about [inaudible] a lot in here.
We talked about them with Jodi,

906
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,770
Jodi medic who got blown up by an IED.

907
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:12,790
There's no, there's no one to
fight. The bomb goes off in.

908
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,470
That's it. Well, who did
this? Who Do you blame?

909
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:22,150
Well, let me answer that question
for these guys. Most of all,

910
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:27,220
they blame the Vietnamese, not the Viet
Cong who they could not see or find,

911
01:00:27,221 --> 01:00:31,090
but the Vietnamese and the villages who
did not warn them of the minefields and

912
01:00:31,091 --> 01:00:32,170
of the booby traps,

913
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:37,200
same thing my school teacher told me
they're starting to apply the blame to

914
01:00:37,331 --> 01:00:39,790
these,
to these Vietnamese villagers.

915
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,273
Hmm.

916
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:49,220
Lieutenant Calley noticed the
change in the mood of the men.

917
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,290
He had been on leave at
the time of the incident,

918
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:54,780
so he wasn't around when this happened.

919
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,873
Hmm.

920
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:58,790
He'd been on leave at
the time of the incident.

921
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:02,210
It had returned the Lz uptight
in time to meet the helicopters,

922
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:05,660
fairing the dead and injured from now on.

923
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:09,590
The men in his platoon no longer gave
candy to the Vietnamese children.

924
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,010
They came across while on
patrol in the villages.

925
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:18,190
Instead Cali noticed with some
satisfaction they kicked everybody aside.

926
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:23,360
Even the nice sweet kids, he could
hardly be refrained from telling them,

927
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,400
well I told you so

928
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,370
now they are starting to,

929
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:41,250
after that incident they're starting
to now assemble information and

930
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:45,870
intelligence for this raid that
they're planning in Milano.

931
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:49,083
So,

932
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,380
and I think it's really important to
take a look to where this intelligence is

933
01:01:53,381 --> 01:01:57,040
coming from and how this cause it paints
a very important part of the picture of

934
01:01:57,041 --> 01:02:01,580
what these guys are being told back to
the book and intelligence roundup for

935
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:02,830
March,

936
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:07,450
1968 prepared respectively summed
up the state of knowledge was this,

937
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:12,870
although some 10 district remained
relatively quiet during this period,

938
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:16,660
elements of the 48th and
existing local force units,

939
01:02:16,661 --> 01:02:20,490
probably roned roamed
the district countryside,

940
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:26,450
the hills north and northwest of me
lie area where probable base camps for

941
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:34,071
elements of the 48th battalion and it
probably received supplies from the

942
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:39,000
peninsula.
So

943
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:43,890
the 48th is an enemy unit,
an enemy, a battalion,

944
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:49,650
and you, you can hear the word probable
being used, gave the probably in the area,

945
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,540
the villagers probably support them.

946
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:56,780
So there isn't a claim being made from
higher from above the chain of command,

947
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:03,330
but you're going to hear that change.
So above the chain of command, there's,

948
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:07,110
there's higher intelligence sets making
these claims that there's probable VC

949
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:09,420
there that they're probably work in
this area that they're probably getting

950
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:12,150
supported from the village
as well as this filters down,

951
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:17,430
it turns from probable to like definite.

952
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:23,760
There is a strange discrepancy between
what the army thought it knew about the

953
01:03:23,761 --> 01:03:26,430
Vietcong and what the
task force thought it.

954
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:31,431
New Army intelligence made only tentative
claims by contrast Rams Dell and for

955
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:37,680
that matter Qutech
we're almost pontifical.

956
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:41,880
So these are the two intelligence
guys at the task force level.

957
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,980
So does that make sense?

958
01:03:43,981 --> 01:03:47,760
So you've got the higher army above them
is telling them, hey, there's probably,

959
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:50,730
there's probably that and these guys are,
are basically starting to say, no, no,

960
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:54,780
this is VC. This is what the what.
This is what's happening factually.

961
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:59,610
Is that Kinda like, like the game of
telephone? One of the little, yeah, it is.

962
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:00,481
And it's also,

963
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:04,680
you're gonna find as I go into this at
both these guys aren't experienced. Mm.

964
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:06,510
So I'll get to it.

965
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:11,160
There was a kind of perverse destiny that
brought the two overweight and middle

966
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:12,390
aged American captains,

967
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:17,391
Ramsdale and Ku talk together
in Tet Kwong NY city.

968
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,890
Both were new boys to the real world of
intelligence assessment in a battle zone.

969
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:24,570
Both were inexperienced,

970
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,600
both desperately eager to establish
a reputation Ramsdale had provided to

971
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:31,321
intelligence,

972
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:36,321
to Cu tag prior to me lie operation and
the curious convergence of their views.

973
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:41,571
Irresistibly suggests that it was indeed
Rams Dell who had provided intelligence

974
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:45,060
for the attack on me,
lie itself,

975
01:04:45,570 --> 01:04:50,550
suggestions at the 48th
local force battalion was up
to 400 strong that everyone

976
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:54,990
in the village was Viet Cong or Viet
cong sympathizer and that at seven on

977
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:55,860
Saturday morning,

978
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,160
all bonafide civilians would have
left the village for the market.

979
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:04,700
All these views were shared by Remes
and Qutech and accepted uncritically by

980
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:07,350
task force barker.
So think about that.

981
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:12,710
You got these guys saying there's 400
up to 400 enemy in the area that the

982
01:05:14,431 --> 01:05:17,620
village is all Vietcong sympathizers

983
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,630
and that on a Saturday,
every one that's her actual civilian,

984
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:25,420
we'll have left at seven o'clock
in the morning for the market.

985
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:29,530
You can't make that claim about any
group of civilians in the world that

986
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:31,340
everyone's going to do something
at the same time. Yeah.

987
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,830
Impossible that you could do.
You could make that claim.

988
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,823
Hmm.

989
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,840
Back to the book asked later about
intelligence indicating that no civilians

990
01:05:41,841 --> 01:05:43,850
will be left in the village
at the time of the attack.

991
01:05:43,851 --> 01:05:47,690
Ramsdale replied that the civilians went
to market early in the morning because

992
01:05:47,691 --> 01:05:48,524
of the heat.

993
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:50,200
Okay.

994
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,250
They testified it appears in a similar
vein in the civilian market and it's

995
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:56,890
really in population area.
There were several markets,

996
01:05:56,891 --> 01:06:00,250
large markets where all the people would
gather each day because they had no

997
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,350
refrigeration or anything like it.

998
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:07,970
With hindsight, it appears
naive, even simple minded.

999
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,660
Yet in 1968 this nugget of anthropological
insight along with the corollary that

1000
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,970
everyone who is not at
the market was Vietcong,

1001
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,670
was deemed unchallengeable
right by Ramsdale,

1002
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,770
considered impeccable by Qutech and
passed on on the amended to the bitter man

1003
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:29,560
of Charlie company seeking
revenge for their losses. The,

1004
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:32,960
this is just a, this is a horrible,
it's a horrible situation. And I had,

1005
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:38,410
I had situations like that
occur with me where it was Earl,

1006
01:06:38,901 --> 01:06:43,901
my first deployment to Iraq
where we got almost like a movie.

1007
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:46,750
We would get maps of,

1008
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:50,760
of a city area and there'd be a
red x on the target building. Yeah,

1009
01:06:50,761 --> 01:06:54,260
you're bad guys in this building.
And I remember one time we went out,

1010
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:59,261
we hit the building with a red x on it
and we didn't find anything or it was all

1011
01:06:59,970 --> 01:07:00,281
we all,

1012
01:07:00,281 --> 01:07:03,230
we all are the people that we got out
of there turned out to be not the person

1013
01:07:03,231 --> 01:07:06,230
we were looking for.
And as we did further analysis,

1014
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,800
we realized that the building
was the wrong building in,

1015
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,610
in after that I got very
critical about, okay, who,

1016
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,810
who put the red x on this building?
Tell me who did that and why they did it.

1017
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:20,650
I want to know, I'm not just going
off of you. Put a red x on a building,

1018
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,960
doesn't mean anything to me.
I want to know who did that.

1019
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,140
And I had another situation where
we went in and hit a building,

1020
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,980
you know where there were suspected bad
guy. We had intelligence on the sky,

1021
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:37,010
was a finance a year and had money
and was giving it to the insurgence.

1022
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,940
And so we went and captured him and
searched his house and you know,

1023
01:07:40,941 --> 01:07:42,780
Birla blew his door off. So we, we,

1024
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:46,820
we caused impact to his house.

1025
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,870
And then when we got him back,
we, after we talked to him,

1026
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:52,370
we figured out this guy was not bad.

1027
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:56,820
And as I pulled the string on what,

1028
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,280
where this intelligence came from,

1029
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,580
that eventually led somebody to put a
red x on his house and describe the guy

1030
01:08:01,581 --> 01:08:04,640
and who he was.
I found out that it was actually he,

1031
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:09,230
the guy owned a business and he had fired
one of his employees and when he fired

1032
01:08:09,231 --> 01:08:13,670
one of his employees, well his employee
went and told the Americans, hey,

1033
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:15,620
this guy's a bad guy.
This guy's funding.

1034
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:19,100
You know,
in search it's got a little disgruntled.

1035
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:23,360
So all you had to do is dig in and find
a little bit more about the information

1036
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:25,220
and you figured out it was
a disgruntled employee.

1037
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:27,350
So guys out there in the field right now,

1038
01:08:27,390 --> 01:08:29,330
when you're always
questioning your intelligence,

1039
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:31,790
nothing against the intelligence folks,
they're going to do the best they can,

1040
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,980
but they're not the ones that are
going to get the blood on their hands.

1041
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,340
So question the intelligence,
find out what the sources are,

1042
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:41,390
find out where the information came from.
Ask who drew that red x.

1043
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:44,090
Ask who said there's not going
to be any villagers in the,

1044
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:47,480
in the no civilians in the village
after seven o'clock in the morning.

1045
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,070
Ask those questions.

1046
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,790
Meanwhile, the loss is these guys
are continued to take casualties.

1047
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:01,270
So they took, what was it,
three killed and 12 wounded.

1048
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:05,230
And now they got Sergeant
Cox killed by a booby trap.

1049
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:08,530
They got a Dyson lost both legs,
Hendrickson's blinded,

1050
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:11,770
suffered groin injuries
and lost an arm and a leg.

1051
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:17,760
So they're continuing to take casualties
and on top of the casualties that

1052
01:09:17,981 --> 01:09:21,220
they're taking, you starting to
get an escalation of behavior,

1053
01:09:21,221 --> 01:09:23,980
of negative behavior.
And here's an example of that.

1054
01:09:23,981 --> 01:09:27,640
Back to the book of village or passing
on a bicycle was beaten up but managed to

1055
01:09:27,641 --> 01:09:31,870
escape. A woman working in the fields was
shot when somebody shouted that she was

1056
01:09:31,871 --> 01:09:35,420
carrying a weapon.
When the squad came closer,

1057
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,670
they discovered she was
on armed and still alive.

1058
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:42,800
They shot her again and kicked her body
to a pulp. Somebody stole her ring.

1059
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,050
They were now close to their base and
angry villagers storm the camp and protest

1060
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:53,200
against the murder.
Medina managed to hush it up.

1061
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,510
No one was charged with any offense.

1062
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,680
Medina said later that the woman had
been discovered with a detonator still in

1063
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:00,514
her hand.

1064
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,570
Kelly commented that Medina wasn't about
to lose men just because they kicked a

1065
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:08,120
Vietnamese kid or kill
the damn innocent woman.

1066
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,340
He had to keep a combat effective unit,

1067
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:16,370
so now you've got clear cover up
going on by the chain of command. Hey,

1068
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:18,440
she had a detonator,
she didn't have a detonator

1069
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:26,660
and it's very visible to see this downward
spiral from a letter from Greg Olson,

1070
01:10:30,721 --> 01:10:31,710
who like I said,

1071
01:10:31,711 --> 01:10:36,711
he was the the Faithful Mormon kid and
he writes a letter to his dad back in the

1072
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:42,190
states. Dear Dad, how's everything
with you? I'm still here on the bridge.

1073
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:43,450
We leave Saturday.

1074
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,010
One of our platoons went out on a
routine patrol today and came across 155

1075
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:52,210
millimeter artillery round. That
was booby trap. It killed one man,

1076
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:57,480
blew the legs off to others and injured
two more and it all turned out a bad

1077
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:02,650
day. Made even worse on
their way back to to Dottie,

1078
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,340
which is there the name of their camp.
They saw a woman working in the fields.

1079
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,640
They shot and wounded her.

1080
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:12,840
Then they kicked her to death and empty
their magazines in her head. They,

1081
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:17,400
every little kid they came across. Why
in God's name does this have to happen?

1082
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,700
These are all seemingly normal guys.

1083
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,550
Some more friends of mine for a while

1084
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,390
they were wild like animals.

1085
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:32,070
It was murder and I'm ashamed of myself
for not trying to do anything about it.

1086
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:35,460
This isn't the first time, dad.
I've seen it many times before.

1087
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,080
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

1088
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:39,480
I guess I just want to
get it all off my chest.

1089
01:11:40,230 --> 01:11:43,020
My faith and fellow man
is all shot to hell.

1090
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:47,070
I just want my time to pass
and I just want to come home.

1091
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,500
I really believe as you do dad,

1092
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:53,700
there's a cause behind all this and
if it is God's will for me to go,

1093
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:58,560
I would rather do it here than
home on a freeway. Saturday,

1094
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:02,730
we're going to be dropped
by air in an Nva stronghold.

1095
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:07,020
I'm hoping I'll be able to get out of
here for a few days to go to a conference.

1096
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:11,250
Don't expect any letters from me for
awhile, but please keep writing them.

1097
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,840
I love and miss you and mom so much.

1098
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:18,600
Your son Greg.

1099
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:26,330
So again highlighted in there
the normalicy of the guys
and how they're starting

1100
01:12:26,331 --> 01:12:29,860
to slide the clear.
It's obvious to,

1101
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:34,280
to Greg Olson that what's happening
is wrong. It unfortunately,

1102
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,170
he's not stepping up and saying anything.

1103
01:12:36,171 --> 01:12:39,260
He's not bringing it to the attention
of anyone. He's letting it happen.

1104
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:45,010
Back to the book with
these most recent losses,

1105
01:12:45,011 --> 01:12:49,900
Charlie company was down to 105 men
since arriving in Vietnam three months

1106
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:53,800
before they had suffered 28 casualties,
including five killed,

1107
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:58,720
three of them in action.
All the casualties, all the
casualties come from mines,

1108
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:00,580
booby traps and snipers.

1109
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:05,440
They had never seen or encountered
the enemy in any strength.

1110
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,140
There had been no heavy contact.

1111
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:12,490
They were battle scarred
without being battle hardened.

1112
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:21,090
So you, you can imagine
again, it's what my,

1113
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:24,390
what's what my high school teacher
told me they're, they're viewing.

1114
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:25,650
They're taking these casualty to head.

1115
01:13:25,651 --> 01:13:30,540
It's very similar to Iraq and Afghanistan
where I think in in Iraq it was 75% of

1116
01:13:30,541 --> 01:13:32,580
the casualties are from ids,

1117
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:35,880
so there's no one to shoot
at after an IED blows up,

1118
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,110
oftentimes there's nothing to shoot at.

1119
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,180
Now
with those casualties,

1120
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:50,250
with that viewpoint, they're starting
to prepare. As I said for this,

1121
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:55,310
this assault on me lie
in back to the book,

1122
01:13:55,801 --> 01:14:00,150
although no written record of the briefing
survives a witnesses all agree on the

1123
01:14:00,151 --> 01:14:03,540
general thrust of cu tax contribution.
This is the intelligence officer.

1124
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,770
The 48th LF battalion was
dispersed throughout the area,

1125
01:14:08,970 --> 01:14:11,920
but the latest intelligence,
the assemble officers were told,

1126
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:17,040
suggested that VC headquarters and two
companies totaling over 200 fighting men.

1127
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:23,250
We're located in me live for the
civilian population population.

1128
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:27,940
We're all active sympathizers with the VC.

1129
01:14:28,690 --> 01:14:29,830
By seven in the morning,

1130
01:14:29,980 --> 01:14:33,280
most noncombatants would have
left the village for the market.

1131
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:37,590
So just to make that clear
what we're expecting,

1132
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:42,650
they're expecting to go in to me lie
and find over 200 fighting men and all

1133
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,910
active sympathizers with the VC.

1134
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,990
Now they start to ask some
questions like, okay, what at the,

1135
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,480
at the task force level,
back to the book,

1136
01:14:57,481 --> 01:14:59,310
what was to happen to the village itself?

1137
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:02,760
Task Force officers left the meeting
with the clear impression that Barker had

1138
01:15:02,761 --> 01:15:05,040
ordered the destruction of all houses,
dwellings,

1139
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:08,580
and livestock in the meal
in the Milwaukee area.

1140
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:12,060
Although there is some doubt as to whether
this was a direct order or something

1141
01:15:12,061 --> 01:15:12,960
that had been assumed.

1142
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:16,800
Qutech recalled barker saying that
the village was to be destroyed.

1143
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:18,780
He wanted the area cleaned out,

1144
01:15:18,781 --> 01:15:22,140
he wanted it neutralized and he
wanted the buildings knocked down.

1145
01:15:22,590 --> 01:15:24,090
He wanted the hooches burned,

1146
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:27,920
he wanted the tunnels field and he
wanted the livestock and chickens runoff

1147
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:29,250
killed or destroyed.

1148
01:15:29,940 --> 01:15:34,350
He wanted to neutralize
the area for Medina. Also.

1149
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,810
Those were Barker's clear instructions

1150
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:40,590
and what was to happen to the civilians.

1151
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:45,060
There is nothing to suggest that
barker explicitly ordered the murder of

1152
01:15:45,061 --> 01:15:47,130
ordinary people have me lie,

1153
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:52,230
but the previous failures of the task
force and the demand for more aggression,

1154
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:56,730
the intelligence picture of an community
entirely controlled by the Vietcong,

1155
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,360
the bland assumption that civilians
would be gone to the market,

1156
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:04,680
the totally unjustified
belief that innocent people
had been worn to get out of

1157
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,270
the area.
In other words,

1158
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:11,271
the entire scorched earth concept of the
operation plan to neutralize the area

1159
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:17,120
drove irresistibly to the conclusion
that here was a free fire zone in which

1160
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:20,820
even the people we're to be eliminated.

1161
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,710
Now that's,

1162
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:32,250
so that's the company commanders getting
the brief from the battalion commander,

1163
01:16:33,071 --> 01:16:35,950
from the task force commander.
That's the impression that they get.

1164
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:40,420
Now we start to get into your Chinese
telephone game because now how does that

1165
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:44,320
get translated down the chain of command
and even with the battalion commander

1166
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:46,870
talking to the company commanders,
there's,

1167
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:51,040
it's not super solid what the
actual orders were. It's not a,

1168
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:53,560
it's not super solid. No one's said,
hey, they said kill women and children.

1169
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:56,700
It's kind of implied. Well, maybe he
said he wanted everyone destroyed.

1170
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:57,730
What does destroyed mean?

1171
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:04,860
So now we get to where Medina is talking
to his troops and his subordinate

1172
01:17:04,991 --> 01:17:06,220
leadership.
The company.

1173
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:11,221
Commander Medina grabbed the shovel from
a quarter ton trailer and drew a map of

1174
01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,080
[inaudible] in the dirt at his feet.

1175
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:18,680
As he described the coming
engagement tomorrow,

1176
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:22,610
he told them was Charlie
company's chance to get even

1177
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:27,660
Medina relayed what he learned at Barker's
briefing earlier in the afternoon,

1178
01:17:27,870 --> 01:17:28,703
the Viet Cong,

1179
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:33,360
the 48 Vietcong Battalion were in me
lie with the strength of between 250 and

1180
01:17:33,361 --> 01:17:37,680
280 so actually he just
increased that number cause the,

1181
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:41,760
the report that he was given was 200 now
he's saying between two 50 and two 80

1182
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,920
this meant that Charlie company would
be out numbered more than two to one but

1183
01:17:46,921 --> 01:17:50,550
they were not to worry because helicopter
gunships would be on the American side.

1184
01:17:50,730 --> 01:17:53,340
He told them to expect
a hell of a good fight.

1185
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,990
He told them that all innocent
civilians would have gone to the market.

1186
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:05,790
He's just amplifying what he was told
but what was going to happen to the

1187
01:18:06,071 --> 01:18:06,904
village.

1188
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:07,940
Yeah.

1189
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:09,650
I told them we had permission.

1190
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:13,970
Colonel Barker had received permission
that the village could be destroyed since

1191
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:18,200
it was a VC stronghold to burn down
the houses to kill all the livestock,

1192
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:23,030
to cut any of the crops that might feed
the VC to cave the wells and destroy the

1193
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:23,864
village.

1194
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,310
Okay,

1195
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:28,640
and what was going to happen
to the innocent civilians?

1196
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,480
Somebody at debriefing asked him,
do we kill women and children?

1197
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:36,530
It was an astounding question that speaks
volumes about the temper of the men,

1198
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,430
but the fact that such a question
was indeed asked is not disputed.

1199
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:44,930
Where testimony is divided
is what Medina replied.

1200
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:49,160
My reply to that question was, no,
you do not kill women and children.

1201
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,120
You must use common sense. If they have
a weapon and are trying to engage you,

1202
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:56,180
then you can shoot back,
but you must use common sense.

1203
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:02,180
But many of the men got a different
message. This is sergeant Hodges,

1204
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:03,800
right?
Recollection of the briefing.

1205
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:09,230
This was a time for us to get even
a time for us to settle the score,

1206
01:19:09,231 --> 01:19:10,790
a time for revenge

1207
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:15,510
when we can get revenge
for our fallen comrades.

1208
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,980
The order we were given was to kill
and destroy everything that was in the

1209
01:19:19,981 --> 01:19:22,830
village. It was to kill the
pigs, dropped them in the wells,

1210
01:19:22,831 --> 01:19:25,920
pollute the water supply kill,
cut down the banana.

1211
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:28,860
Trees burned the village burden,
the hooches. As we went through it,

1212
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:33,390
it was clearly explained that we were,
that there were to be no prisoners.

1213
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,430
That order was given.

1214
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:38,640
The order that was given was to
kill everyone in the village.

1215
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:43,810
Someone asked if that meant that women
and children and the order was everyone

1216
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,780
in the village because those people
in that village, the women, the kids,

1217
01:19:48,781 --> 01:19:50,640
the old men were VC.

1218
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:54,600
They were Viet Cong themselves or
they were sympathetic to the Vietcong.

1219
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,140
They were not sympathetic
to the American marcons.

1220
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:01,860
It was quite clear that no one
was to be spared in that village.

1221
01:20:05,060 --> 01:20:09,930
So pretty clear what sergeant
Hodges thought. So Medina says, no,

1222
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:11,970
I didn't tell him. I told him you
had to use their common sense.

1223
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:15,270
If they're shooting at you, then you
kill him. Hodges didn't hear that.

1224
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:18,360
And back to the book.
Sergeant Hodges was not alone.

1225
01:20:18,361 --> 01:20:22,830
In his interpretation of
Medina's briefing, many senior
NCO has left the meeting,

1226
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:27,540
convinced that the order was to
kill everyone. Staff Sergeant Bacon.

1227
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:31,440
We were to kill all Viet Cong and all
Vietcong sympathizers in the village.

1228
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:36,060
Sergeant West. It was a search and destroy
mission. We were to kill everything.

1229
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,390
Staff Sergeant Fagan kill everyone.

1230
01:20:40,140 --> 01:20:44,670
Sergeant Cowen to kill everything that
was in the village enlisted men to

1231
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:47,040
glimpse La Martina Gonzales,

1232
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:50,790
Lloyd Parsh Moss later testified
that this is what they heard.

1233
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,080
Flint even remembered the
question someone asked,

1234
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:57,450
are we supposed to kill women
and children? And Medina replied,

1235
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:01,740
kill everything that moves.
Harry Stanley said,

1236
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,390
Captain Medina told us
that the intelligence that
established that me lie for

1237
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,700
was completely enemy controlled.

1238
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:13,650
He described the formations we were to
use following day and told us to carry

1239
01:21:13,651 --> 01:21:17,820
extra ammunition. He ordered us
to kill everything in the village.

1240
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:21,420
The men in my squad talked about amongst
ourselves that night because the order

1241
01:21:21,421 --> 01:21:23,580
to kill everything in the
village was so unusual.

1242
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:28,590
We all agreed that Captain Medina
meant for us to kill every man, woman,

1243
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:30,480
and child in the village,

1244
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:37,080
but not everyone agreed that Medina had
ordered everyone in the village to be

1245
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:39,960
killed. Greg Olsen, who's
foreboding letter to his father,

1246
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:43,770
had been posted only two days before has
a completely different recollection of

1247
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:44,604
the briefing.

1248
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:49,380
There clearly absolutely wasn't an order
to go in and slaughter everybody in

1249
01:21:49,381 --> 01:21:51,990
that village and anybody
that says so is a liar.

1250
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:56,430
Medina said that any villagers were to
be rounded up in airlifted to refugee

1251
01:21:56,431 --> 01:21:59,070
camps. That was specifically
addressed in the meeting.

1252
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:02,670
If I thought I was going to get on a
helicopter that morning with clear orders

1253
01:22:02,671 --> 01:22:04,680
that I was going to
slaughter every living,

1254
01:22:04,681 --> 01:22:06,570
breathing human being in that village,

1255
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:11,820
I'm sure to God it would have been
so appalling and unthinkable. I mean,

1256
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:12,930
I'm not that stupid.

1257
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,990
I know they couldn't have forced
me to do something like that.

1258
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,250
Others two denied.
There was any explicit order.

1259
01:22:21,910 --> 01:22:23,680
It was like Medina's Ben Addiction.

1260
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:27,760
Michael Bernhardt said he didn't
actually say to kill every man,

1261
01:22:27,761 --> 01:22:30,970
woman and child in me lie.
He stopped.

1262
01:22:30,971 --> 01:22:35,971
Just short of saying that he gave every
other indication that that's what he

1263
01:22:36,641 --> 01:22:40,300
expected.
Whatever Medina actually said,

1264
01:22:40,570 --> 01:22:44,470
there can be no doubt about the impression
he made to get the most of the men

1265
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,620
to hurt pride.

1266
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:51,790
He offered satisfaction
to grieving soldiers.

1267
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:56,230
He offered a chance to strike
back to bitter and resentful men.

1268
01:22:56,380 --> 01:22:58,660
He offered an end to the frustration.

1269
01:23:00,220 --> 01:23:02,800
Medina let slip,
the dogs of war

1270
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:05,990
me

1271
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:10,620
lie for was thrown in the path
of their vindictiveness and fury.

1272
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:14,850
Charlie company was going to get it wrong.
It's revenge.

1273
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:20,480
The task force would get its body count
this time there would be no mistake.

1274
01:23:28,900 --> 01:23:30,640
So that's where,

1275
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:38,990
that's the attitude that these guys
roll into the operation with and it is

1276
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:49,790
not the right attitude Dav going into
the situation because if case you haven't

1277
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:53,280
figured this out yet,
the village that they're going into,

1278
01:23:54,570 --> 01:23:59,370
there's no battalion of Viet Cong
fighters, there's no fighters at all.

1279
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:05,110
And here they start their attack.

1280
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:10,990
March 16th,
1968 seven 15 in the morning

1281
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:15,190
out in the fields of farmer,

1282
01:24:15,191 --> 01:24:20,080
frantically raised his hands by way
of both greeting and to show he had no

1283
01:24:20,081 --> 01:24:24,670
weapon. He was immediately filled
by a burst from a machine gun

1284
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:28,720
along with the gun ships.

1285
01:24:28,721 --> 01:24:33,160
Almost everyone in first and second
platoon's was firing their weapons and now

1286
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:37,120
third platoon was joining in the
moment of Vietnamese was spotted.

1287
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:42,450
Volleys of fire were loosed off and
the enemy fell wounded or dying,

1288
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:47,530
who is a parent to Bernhardt as it was
to virtually everyone gathered there on

1289
01:24:47,531 --> 01:24:51,610
the ground that they were
receiving no return. Fire it all.

1290
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:53,890
There was no incoming

1291
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:00,870
hold.

1292
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:05,190
Came across a hut which had
been raped with bullets inside.

1293
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:07,440
Burkholder discovered three children,

1294
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,280
a woman with a flesh wound in her
side and an old man squatting down,

1295
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:12,570
hardly able to move.

1296
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:17,610
He had been seriously wounded
and both legs from six feet.

1297
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:22,740
Burke called aimed his 45 caliber pistol
and pulled the trigger causing the top

1298
01:25:22,741 --> 01:25:24,390
of the man's head to fly off.

1299
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:29,610
It was a site that would forever
be etched in maples memory.

1300
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:35,010
Burke hold claim to have shot
the old man as an act of mercy.

1301
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:40,250
Okay.

1302
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:44,720
Harry Stanley saw that the fleeing
villagers were offering no resistance.

1303
01:25:45,230 --> 01:25:47,600
His friend Alan Boys
who lived in New Jersey,

1304
01:25:47,601 --> 01:25:50,930
only a couple of miles from maples
came up behind him with a Vietnamese

1305
01:25:50,931 --> 01:25:54,800
foreigner aged between 40
and 50 years in custody.

1306
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,450
He wore black pajamas and his shirt
hung open so that Stanley could see his

1307
01:25:59,451 --> 01:26:03,980
chest. Boys pushed the man forward
to where Stanley standing beside the

1308
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,830
trail suddenly and for no reason.

1309
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:10,130
Boy stabbed the man with the bayonet
attached to the end of his rifle.

1310
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:13,160
He fell to the ground grasping for breath.

1311
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:18,560
Boys killed him and then grabbed
another man being detained,

1312
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:23,270
shot him in the neck and threw him into
a well lobbing and him 26 grenade after

1313
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:27,200
him. That's the way you got
to do it. He told Simpson,

1314
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,740
Robert Lee, the platoon
medic, joined in the frenzy,

1315
01:26:33,741 --> 01:26:36,290
but can find his efforts
to slaughtering animals.

1316
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:38,480
He killed a cow that had been injured.

1317
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:43,660
Lee was from a farming
community and didn't want to
see the bees suffer upfront.

1318
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:45,140
He and the platoon sergeant,

1319
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,170
Isaiah Cowan could see women
and children being slain.

1320
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,870
They were stunned by what was
happening all around them.

1321
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:54,770
The further they went into the village,
the more bodies they found

1322
01:26:57,880 --> 01:27:00,070
to county, and he's another guy, Conti.

1323
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,710
The men appear to all psyched up when
they landed. The shooting wants a,

1324
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:05,920
began created almost a chain reaction.

1325
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:09,520
He joined in without killing
anyone inside the village.

1326
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,620
His comrades appeared out of control.

1327
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:16,690
Families huddled together for safety and
houses in yards and in bunkers only to

1328
01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:21,550
be mown down with automatic weapon fire
or blown apart by fragmentation grenades,

1329
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:26,500
women and children were pushed into
bunkers and grenades thrown after them.

1330
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:30,640
At one point,
wandering off on his own,

1331
01:27:30,641 --> 01:27:34,150
conti found a woman aged about
20 with a four year old child.

1332
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:39,790
He forced her to perform oral sex on him
while he held a gun at the child's head,

1333
01:27:40,270 --> 01:27:41,290
threatening to kill it.

1334
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:50,580
Half a dozen people from both
platoons then witnessed a stocky,

1335
01:27:50,581 --> 01:27:54,240
blond haired second platoon soldier
from Kansas City called Gary Ross.

1336
01:27:54,241 --> 01:27:57,660
Lovitz become a sterically when troops
from first platoon were walking,

1337
01:27:57,661 --> 01:27:59,820
a small group of villagers
back for screening.

1338
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,860
Raw chevettes age 25 was older than most
of the grunts in the company standing

1339
01:28:04,861 --> 01:28:07,770
almost six feet tall and
weighed close to 230 pounds.

1340
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:12,090
He made a surprise grab for Roy Woods
[inaudible] and demanded the weapon as a

1341
01:28:12,091 --> 01:28:15,150
trade for his m 79 but
would wasn't having any.

1342
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:19,200
Don't turn them over to the company.
Rush of it's appealed to.

1343
01:28:19,201 --> 01:28:20,880
Those gathered there,
kill them.

1344
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:25,800
Wood is physically by far is the smaller
of the two men held tightly onto his

1345
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:30,020
rifle. Roster of Zen, snatched
a hold of Bernado Simpsons.

1346
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:35,070
M 16 turned and shot a Vietnamese farmer
in the head would began feeling sick at

1347
01:28:35,791 --> 01:28:38,640
the side of the man's brain spilling
on the ground as he turned away.

1348
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,740
Rush of it's shot.

1349
01:28:40,741 --> 01:28:44,610
Two more peasants in the head before
handing the gun back to Simpson

1350
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:50,110
in the northern position of the village.

1351
01:28:50,111 --> 01:28:55,111
Second platoon had also run Bismarck
employing the routine combat assault

1352
01:28:55,751 --> 01:28:57,880
technique used by Kelly Steven Brooks.

1353
01:28:57,881 --> 01:29:02,881
Men also approached line abreast in
three squats firing as they moved,

1354
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:06,780
they came to dwellings and yelled out,
lie day in Vietnamese for come here.

1355
01:29:08,190 --> 01:29:10,320
The villagers at the villagers sheltering,

1356
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:13,950
sheltering inside homemade
shelters or bunkers,

1357
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:16,830
fragmentation grenades were tossed inside.

1358
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:19,380
Homes were sprayed with automatic fire.

1359
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:24,140
Children aged six or seven came toward
them with their hands out stretch saying

1360
01:29:24,141 --> 01:29:24,974
chop chop.

1361
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:29,190
They asked for Food and candy they had
received from other American soldiers on

1362
01:29:29,191 --> 01:29:31,440
the two previous visits to the village,

1363
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:37,160
the soldiers Skype them down after one
group of Vietnamese were killed in front

1364
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:41,220
of a hot. The first squad
leader, Sergeant Kenneth,

1365
01:29:41,221 --> 01:29:44,730
she'll began telling his men that
he didn't like what they were doing,

1366
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:47,370
but that they had to obey orders.

1367
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:50,370
The villagers at huddled
together for safety,

1368
01:29:50,371 --> 01:29:54,000
but the Americans poured fire into them,
tearing their bodies apart.

1369
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:59,120
One man firing a machine gun at random
other using m sixteens on automatic.

1370
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:06,880
Brooke's Radio Operator,
Dean fields,

1371
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:10,780
witness for Natto Simpson shoot a woman
with a baby from a distance of about 25

1372
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:14,470
meters or arm was shot almost
completely off at the wrist.

1373
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,510
All that it held. All that held it
on was a fragile piece of flesh.

1374
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:22,080
She ran into a coach and someone yelled,

1375
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:25,060
in order for her and
the baby to be killed.

1376
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:31,390
Max Hudson, the weapons
squad leader formed a machine
gun team with Floyd, right.

1377
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,190
As soon as they past the tree line,

1378
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:37,210
they were confronted less than 30 feet
away by a middle aged woman climbing out

1379
01:30:37,211 --> 01:30:40,360
of a tunnel, using both
hands. She was on armed,

1380
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,850
but they opened fire and she
fell back into the tunnel.

1381
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:45,790
Hudson and right took
turns on the machine gun.

1382
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:49,240
Whenever they came across any Vietnamese,
they opened fire killing them.

1383
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:52,840
Hudson could see people
firing all around him.

1384
01:30:52,841 --> 01:30:56,920
The whole scene was one of chaos and
confusion with people moving, yelling,

1385
01:30:56,950 --> 01:31:01,810
and shouting. Some of the
troops were afraid they would
be shot by their own men.

1386
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,303
Okay.

1387
01:31:08,340 --> 01:31:11,370
In the clearing in a
clearing near a small coach,

1388
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:16,050
a group of 15 Vietnamese had been gathered
for women in their thirties three in

1389
01:31:16,051 --> 01:31:20,100
their 50s three girls in their late teens
and five children ages between three

1390
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:25,101
and 14 standing around where seven or
eight soldiers from different squads,

1391
01:31:25,321 --> 01:31:26,250
including Hutto,

1392
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:30,720
Torres and raw chevettes Gonzales heard
someone yell that if anyone was behind

1393
01:31:30,721 --> 01:31:33,510
the Vietnamese to take cover because
they were going to open fire.

1394
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:39,630
A shot rang out when a bullet penetrated
the head of a young child being carried

1395
01:31:39,631 --> 01:31:42,360
by its mother,
blowing out the back of its skull.

1396
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,680
Others began firing until
the entire group was dead.

1397
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:51,150
Gonzalez could stand no more.
He turned away and vomited.

1398
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:56,880
Few words were spoken until someone said,
let's move out.

1399
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:58,610
Yeah.

1400
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:00,340
A soldier over a tunnel

1401
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,200
yelled for the occupants to come out.

1402
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:05,800
Gonzales moved closer and could hear
people responding as if they were about to

1403
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:06,450
comply.

1404
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:11,450
Where upon the soldier through in a
grenade and yelled fire in the hole,

1405
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:13,300
telling everyone to stand clear.

1406
01:32:15,610 --> 01:32:20,610
Kelly had been called twice that morning
on the radio by an anxious Medina.

1407
01:32:21,940 --> 01:32:23,140
What is happening over there?

1408
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:27,700
Medina did demanded to know challenging
the slow progress of the first platoon.

1409
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:32,500
He wanted Kelly to get his men
back online and keep moving.

1410
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:37,180
This made the young platoon commander
nervous throughout his time with the

1411
01:32:37,181 --> 01:32:37,810
company.

1412
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:42,430
He had frequently been made the bud of
Medina's jokes Medina new Cali couldn't

1413
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:45,700
command the respect of his men.
Now under pressure,

1414
01:32:45,790 --> 01:32:50,140
Cali replied that large
groups of civilians had
gathered and were slowing the

1415
01:32:50,141 --> 01:32:53,770
platoon down.
Never want to accept excuses.

1416
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:56,740
Medina told Kelly simply
to get rid of them.

1417
01:32:57,460 --> 01:33:01,660
So when Kelly came across meet low and
conti and the clearing and said take care

1418
01:33:01,661 --> 01:33:06,520
of them. His intention was clear. It was
his way of getting Medina office back.

1419
01:33:07,900 --> 01:33:12,040
Conti thought nothing of the implications
of Kelly's request when you re simply

1420
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:15,130
replied. Okay. Like many in the company,

1421
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:20,110
he regarded the man as a joke and resented
cat the way Kelly tried to suck up to

1422
01:33:20,111 --> 01:33:24,100
the men one minute by calling them by
their first names and then shouted and

1423
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:24,731
bawled at them.

1424
01:33:24,731 --> 01:33:29,731
The next conti felt his platoon commander
had absolutely no leadership ability.

1425
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:32,680
Among the squatting.

1426
01:33:32,681 --> 01:33:37,681
Vietnamese were 10 to 15 men with beards
and 10 woman women as well as a handful

1427
01:33:38,381 --> 01:33:41,170
of very elderly,
gray haired women who could hardly walk.

1428
01:33:41,710 --> 01:33:43,690
The rest were children of all ages,

1429
01:33:44,590 --> 01:33:47,290
from babies up to early teens.

1430
01:33:48,450 --> 01:33:52,930
Calley who is carrying a bandolier
of ammunition on one shoulder said,

1431
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:54,790
I thought I told you to take care of them.

1432
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:59,680
Me Though responded somewhat naively,
we are.

1433
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,700
We're watching over them.
No re re posted Cali.

1434
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:08,470
I want them killed. He moved over to
where conti was standing beside me low.

1435
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:14,640
We'll get online and fire into them.
Conti and meet though.

1436
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,140
Look to each other and backed off.

1437
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,170
Neither of them wanting a part
in what was about to happen.

1438
01:34:20,070 --> 01:34:24,330
Cali losing his temper beckoned them
toward him. Come here, come here.

1439
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,460
Come on. We'll line them
up. We'll kill them.

1440
01:34:27,410 --> 01:34:30,720
Conti searching for an excuse pointed
out that he was carrying a grenade

1441
01:34:30,721 --> 01:34:33,000
launcher and he didn't
want to waste ammunition.

1442
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,360
Perhaps he could keep guard over by the
tree line in case anyone tried to get

1443
01:34:36,361 --> 01:34:39,960
away.
He suggested Kelly turned to meet low

1444
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,390
fire.
When I say fire,

1445
01:34:44,740 --> 01:34:49,090
Conti stood behind them as Kelly and me.
Low standing side by side, blazed away.

1446
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,950
The stood only 10 feet from their
hapless victims. Changing magazines.

1447
01:34:53,951 --> 01:34:57,800
From time to time the Vietnamese screamed,
yelled,

1448
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:01,690
and tried to get up.
It was pure carnage.

1449
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,090
Has heads were shot off along with limbs.

1450
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:06,790
The flesh of your body
parts were ripped to shreds.

1451
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:12,940
Meet low had taken 23 fully
loaded magazines for his m
16 in his pack when they

1452
01:35:12,941 --> 01:35:16,360
had left Dottie,
he fired in a spraying motion.

1453
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:21,820
He noticed one man dressed in red fall
dead as he fired the rifle on automatic

1454
01:35:21,821 --> 01:35:25,300
until the magazine was exhausted.
Then he reloaded.

1455
01:35:26,050 --> 01:35:29,740
He switched to semiautomatic fire
and loaded the third magazine.

1456
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:33,640
After a minute or so,
meatloaf couldn't continue.

1457
01:35:34,630 --> 01:35:35,370
Okay.

1458
01:35:35,370 --> 01:35:37,350
Tears flooded down his cheeks,

1459
01:35:38,670 --> 01:35:39,010
okay.

1460
01:35:39,010 --> 01:35:43,660
He turned, stuck his rifle and caught
these hand and said, you shoot them conti.

1461
01:35:43,661 --> 01:35:47,770
Push the weapon back. If they are going
to be killed, I'm not going to do it.

1462
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:51,820
Let him do it. He said,
pointing at Cali. By this time,

1463
01:35:51,821 --> 01:35:55,660
Conti could see only a few
children were left standing.

1464
01:35:56,500 --> 01:36:00,970
Mothers had thrown themselves on top of
the young ones in the last desperate bid

1465
01:36:00,971 --> 01:36:03,400
to protect them from bullets
raining down on them.

1466
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,980
The children were trying to stand up.
Kelly open fire again,

1467
01:36:09,490 --> 01:36:13,450
killing them one by one.
Conti swore at him.

1468
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,110
Finally,
when it appeared to be all over,

1469
01:36:17,890 --> 01:36:21,130
Kelly calmly turned and
said, okay, let's go.

1470
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:27,060
Suddenly someone yelled out that more
Vietnamese, five women in six children,

1471
01:36:27,061 --> 01:36:30,100
some distance away.
We're making a break for the tree line.

1472
01:36:31,350 --> 01:36:34,590
Kelly burst out, get
them, get them, kill them.

1473
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,470
Milos face was flushed.

1474
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:42,920
His eyes were still full of tears.

1475
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:47,570
When he arrived with grease sick at the
ditch site and found Kelly sitting down,

1476
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:51,770
we've got another job to do.
He said, looking up them,

1477
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,800
about 10 members of the
platoon were guarding.

1478
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:59,000
40 to 50 Vietnamese babies were
crying and crawling around.

1479
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:00,590
James Darcy,

1480
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:05,710
a heavy set Irish Italian from Brooklyn
was looking at a man in white robes with

1481
01:37:06,141 --> 01:37:10,040
a goatee beard whom he took
to be a Buddhist monk praying
over an elderly woman.

1482
01:37:11,180 --> 01:37:13,970
She was seriously ill and had been
carried through the village on a narrow

1483
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:18,680
wooden platform, which the Vietnamese
used as a bed. Kelly was now on his feet.

1484
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:22,670
Hairy Stanley appeared on the scene and
tried to question the monk who is crying

1485
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,310
and bowing as he tried to
make himself understood,

1486
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,800
Kelly couldn't understand him.
[inaudible]

1487
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,630
who had attended Vietnamese
language classes in Hawaii,

1488
01:37:32,631 --> 01:37:37,310
tried more questions and got nowhere.
Kelly was getting more and more impatient.

1489
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:41,000
Where had the Viet Cong gone?
Where were the weapons?

1490
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:44,450
Where were the Nva when
the man shook his head,

1491
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:46,490
Cali struck him in the
mouth with his rifle,

1492
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:51,440
but just then a child aged about two
years and parted from its mother,

1493
01:37:51,441 --> 01:37:53,600
managed to crawl up to
the top of the ditch.

1494
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:57,360
Darcy watched horrified as
Kelly picked up the child,

1495
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:01,620
shoved it back down the slope and shot
it before returning to question the monk,

1496
01:38:02,310 --> 01:38:04,710
the villagers pleaded
for the holy man's life.

1497
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:09,390
Stanley asked the bearded man the same
questions in Vietnamese that Kelly was

1498
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:12,120
asking in English in an effort
to diffuse the situation,

1499
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:17,190
but the monk vainly replied that there
were no north Vietnamese soldiers in the

1500
01:38:17,191 --> 01:38:19,350
village.
There were no weapons.

1501
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:21,230
Yeah.

1502
01:38:21,230 --> 01:38:25,430
Stanley translated these replies
immediately. Kalee grabbed the monk,

1503
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:26,690
pulled him round,

1504
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:31,870
hurled him into the patty and open fire
with Milos m 16 as the elderly Mama

1505
01:38:33,230 --> 01:38:36,740
Sohn, lying pro streps
prostrate tried to get up.

1506
01:38:38,450 --> 01:38:40,280
She too was killed.

1507
01:38:41,780 --> 01:38:45,920
More Vietnamese shepherded by soldiers
were arriving on the scene and Kelly

1508
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:48,740
indicated Emilio and boys,
he wanted everyone killed.

1509
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,040
He began pushing peasants
into the irrigation channel.

1510
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:56,510
Others joined in using their rifle butts
to shove whaling Vietnamese down the

1511
01:38:56,511 --> 01:39:00,560
sleep steep slope.
Some jumped in by themselves.

1512
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,350
Others sat down on the
edge moaning and crying,

1513
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:07,970
clearly aware that disaster was imminent.

1514
01:39:08,990 --> 01:39:10,160
It was a pitiful sight,

1515
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:11,483
okay?

1516
01:39:11,650 --> 01:39:13,780
Until the time all the firing started,

1517
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:18,430
Herbert Carter had been kneeling beside
Darcy quietly playing with a couple of

1518
01:39:18,431 --> 01:39:21,490
children. Darcy said, incredulously,

1519
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:25,240
I think Kelly wants them all killed.
Carter said,

1520
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:30,480
oh no, he can send me to jail,
but I'm not going to kill anybody.

1521
01:39:30,490 --> 01:39:33,740
Said Darcy beginning to move away and
wondering what would happen to him for

1522
01:39:33,741 --> 01:39:34,930
refusing to fire.

1523
01:39:35,620 --> 01:39:39,640
Darcy was another one who liked to play
with the children earlier in the day.

1524
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:40,600
He'd been devastated.

1525
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:43,300
After he opened fire and killed
someone running from the village,

1526
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,370
it turned out to be a
woman and carrying a baby,

1527
01:39:45,371 --> 01:39:49,840
and Darcy was horrified and ashamed
by what he had done. Olsen had seen.

1528
01:39:49,841 --> 01:39:51,190
He was really caught up about it.

1529
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:52,530
Yeah.

1530
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:56,640
A woman standing next to Robert Maples
showed him a bullet wound in her left arm.

1531
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:59,670
He felt helpless.
There was nothing he could do for her.

1532
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:03,420
Kelly shoved her in the
ditch and told Maples,

1533
01:40:03,510 --> 01:40:05,730
load your machine gun
and shoot these people.

1534
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:09,690
Maple shook his head and replied,
I'm not gonna do that.

1535
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,320
Kelly turned his m 16 on Maples
as if to shoot him. Then in there,

1536
01:40:14,250 --> 01:40:17,850
maples will surprised and relieved when
some of the other soldiers interpose to

1537
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:22,830
protect him. Kelly backed
off. Seconds later,

1538
01:40:23,940 --> 01:40:25,650
he and me low began firing.

1539
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:31,290
A machine gun opened up and one of the
squad leaders tried to usher the man into

1540
01:40:31,291 --> 01:40:33,600
line so they can all fire simultaneously.

1541
01:40:34,410 --> 01:40:39,300
Darcy stewed completely frozen watching
disbelievingly as the Vietnamese tried

1542
01:40:39,301 --> 01:40:43,290
frantically to hide under one another.
Mother's protecting babies.

1543
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:44,920
Yeah.

1544
01:40:44,920 --> 01:40:48,900
Screaming at Dorsey above the sounds of
the [inaudible] on full automatic meat.

1545
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:51,580
Low continued pouring
shells into the ditch,

1546
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:54,290
crying hysterically

1547
01:40:54,290 --> 01:40:57,470
once more. He stopped for a
second. Why are you firing?

1548
01:40:57,590 --> 01:41:01,560
He pleaded with Darcy fire.
Why don't you fire? Okay.

1549
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:05,220
The onlookers saw remnants
of shredded human beings,

1550
01:41:05,250 --> 01:41:09,930
hundreds of pieces of flesh and bone
flying up in the air as the shallow ravine

1551
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:14,620
was repeatedly sprayed with bullets
magazine.

1552
01:41:14,621 --> 01:41:18,640
After magazine was reloaded
during the mass execution,

1553
01:41:25,870 --> 01:41:27,340
it has all this,

1554
01:41:29,930 --> 01:41:30,763
okay.

1555
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:35,420
Horrendous scene is unfolding.

1556
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:39,440
There is actually a,
a photographer there,

1557
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,860
military photographer,
aim haberly

1558
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:47,060
and he's taking pictures

1559
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:55,290
and he, it was almost like he was
just instinctively shooting. He,

1560
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:57,210
he kind of detached himself.

1561
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:58,453
Hmm.

1562
01:41:59,690 --> 01:42:03,020
And here's what he said. I knew it was
something that shouldn't be happening,

1563
01:42:03,290 --> 01:42:04,550
but yet I was part of it.

1564
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:09,140
I think I was in a kind of a daze from
seeing all these shootings and not seeing

1565
01:42:09,200 --> 01:42:12,140
any return fire yet.
The killing kept going on.

1566
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:15,350
The Americans were rounding up
the people and shooting them,

1567
01:42:15,351 --> 01:42:16,790
not taking any prisoners.

1568
01:42:17,480 --> 01:42:20,990
It was completely different to my
concept of what war is all about.

1569
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:24,920
I kept taking pictures. That was my
job as a photographer to take pictures,

1570
01:42:25,070 --> 01:42:30,070
a normal reaction I have with a camera
just picking up and keep on shooting,

1571
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:32,120
trying to capture what
is happening around me.

1572
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:36,620
I feel sometimes that the camera
did take over during the operation.

1573
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:41,300
I put it up to my, I took a shot,
put it down. Nothing was composed.

1574
01:42:41,390 --> 01:42:44,840
Nothing was pre thought, just the
normal reaction of a photographer.

1575
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:46,970
I was part of it.

1576
01:42:47,180 --> 01:42:50,750
Everyone who was there was part of it
and that includes the general and the

1577
01:42:50,751 --> 01:42:53,900
colonel flying above in their helicopters.
They're all part of it.

1578
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:56,413
Yeah.

1579
01:42:56,660 --> 01:42:57,493
We all were.

1580
01:42:58,200 --> 01:42:58,790
Okay.

1581
01:42:58,790 --> 01:43:00,110
Just a one big group.

1582
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:07,250
Now as all this is is happening,
you've got Medina,

1583
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:11,330
who's the, again, the company commander.
He sorta coming up from the rear

1584
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:17,600
and he starting to assess what he's seeing
back to the book.

1585
01:43:17,601 --> 01:43:20,990
While mudita might not have seen
mass executions taking place,

1586
01:43:20,991 --> 01:43:24,650
the evidence of his own eyes told
him what everyone else could see,

1587
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:29,030
that some kind of massacre had occurred.
In fact,

1588
01:43:29,031 --> 01:43:30,590
it was a worse than a massacre.

1589
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:35,960
Too many of Medina's men were taking
sword pleasure in sadistic behavior.

1590
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:40,520
Several became double veterans,

1591
01:43:40,850 --> 01:43:45,590
GI slang for the dubious honor of
raping a woman and then murdering her.

1592
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,240
Many women were raped and sodomized,
mutilated,

1593
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:54,740
and had their vaginas ripped
open with knives or bay and nets.

1594
01:43:55,780 --> 01:43:56,270
Okay.

1595
01:43:56,270 --> 01:43:59,870
One woman was killed when the muzzle
of a rifle barrel was inserted into her

1596
01:43:59,871 --> 01:44:02,090
vagina and the trigger was pulled.

1597
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:07,820
Soldiers repeatedly stabbed their victims,
caught off limbs,

1598
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:12,600
sometimes beheaded them.
Some were scalped,

1599
01:44:12,790 --> 01:44:16,770
others had their tongues caught
out or their throats slit or both

1600
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:21,970
Tommy Lee Moss saw Vietnamese place
their hands together and bowed.

1601
01:44:21,971 --> 01:44:26,410
Agreed Americans only it'd be beaten
with fists and tortured club with rifles

1602
01:44:26,411 --> 01:44:28,420
and stabbed in the back with bayonets.

1603
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:34,570
Martin Fagan saw bodies which had been
shot in the head at point blank range.

1604
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:38,740
He could tell because the penetration
of an m 16 round create a shock wave

1605
01:44:38,741 --> 01:44:41,320
inside the skull,
forcing the brain completely out.

1606
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:43,070
Okay.

1607
01:44:43,070 --> 01:44:47,900
Other victims were mutilated with the
signature c company or the shape of an ace

1608
01:44:47,901 --> 01:44:49,760
of spades carved into the chest.

1609
01:44:50,840 --> 01:44:54,590
Fagin figured this had been done as a
warning to the superstitious Vietnamese.

1610
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:58,550
It was widely believed that they regarded
the ace of spades as a sign of bad

1611
01:44:58,551 --> 01:44:59,384
luck.

1612
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:00,960
Okay.

1613
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,920
Troops from all three platoons carried
out wanting and mindless acts of

1614
01:45:04,921 --> 01:45:05,754
brutality.

1615
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:11,710
The second platoon were already amongst
the most notorious rapists and Charlie

1616
01:45:11,711 --> 01:45:16,450
company. Even the platoon
commander joined in on occasions.

1617
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:23,740
Raw chevettes forced the women too on
dress with the intention of having sex

1618
01:45:23,741 --> 01:45:28,420
with all of them. If they didn't strip,
he said he was going to shoot them.

1619
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:31,300
He singled out one woman
telling her to boom, boom him.

1620
01:45:32,020 --> 01:45:34,780
She became a Richele and
the other women panicked,

1621
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,910
yelling and screaming
and begging for mercy.

1622
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:39,310
Russia vits decided to let them have it.

1623
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,880
He fired several rounds
and killed them all

1624
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:47,440
and now we got [inaudible] again.

1625
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:50,330
He's the photographer and
this is what he's witnessing.

1626
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:53,630
Just as soon as I turned away, I
heard firing. I saw people drop.

1627
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:57,680
They started falling on top of each other,
one on top of another.

1628
01:45:58,190 --> 01:46:01,040
I just kept walking.
I did not pay attention to who did it.

1629
01:46:01,370 --> 01:46:04,430
By that time I knew what the score was.
It was an atrocity.

1630
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:09,440
I felt I wanted to do something to stop
this as though as we were going through

1631
01:46:09,441 --> 01:46:09,951
the village,

1632
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:14,630
I asked some soldiers why they more or
less shrugged their soldiers and kept on

1633
01:46:14,631 --> 01:46:15,464
with the killing.

1634
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:16,770
Okay.

1635
01:46:16,770 --> 01:46:19,950
It was like they were fixed on one thing,
search and destroy,

1636
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,960
and that meant killing civilians.

1637
01:46:22,980 --> 01:46:25,950
I noticed this one small boy
had been shot in the foot.

1638
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:27,630
Part of the foot was torn off.

1639
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:30,540
He was walking towards a group
of bodies looking for his mother.

1640
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:31,910
Okay.

1641
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:36,290
I put up my camera up to my eye,
I what's going to take a photograph?

1642
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:41,630
I didn't notice a Gi down beside me with
his m 16 rifle pointed at the child.

1643
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:43,180
Yeah.

1644
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:45,760
Then suddenly I heard the crack
and through the view finder,

1645
01:46:45,761 --> 01:46:49,360
I saw this child flip over
on top of the pile of bodies.

1646
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:54,540
The Gi just stood up and walked away.

1647
01:46:55,560 --> 01:47:00,420
No remorse, nothing. The other
soldiers had a cold reaction.

1648
01:47:00,570 --> 01:47:04,080
They were staring off into space
like it was an everyday thing.

1649
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,680
They felt they had to
do it and they did it.

1650
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:12,600
That was their job. It was weird.
Just a shrug of the shoulder.

1651
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:17,640
No emotional reaction.
Now,

1652
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:19,680
above this,
you had

1653
01:47:21,190 --> 01:47:23,100
above this horror.

1654
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,910
You had helicopters that were
flying around. They were,

1655
01:47:27,720 --> 01:47:30,630
some of them were gunships,
some of them were there to pick people up,

1656
01:47:30,631 --> 01:47:33,330
drop people off.
Some of them were commanding control.

1657
01:47:33,570 --> 01:47:37,770
Helicopters were some senior leadership
was flying around trying to observe the,

1658
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:41,990
the battles that took place.
And we do end up with a, uh,

1659
01:47:42,780 --> 01:47:47,610
with a, a real hero here, a
hero that's a helicopter pilot

1660
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,273
and

1661
01:47:53,430 --> 01:47:58,080
his name is Hugh [inaudible] Thompson Jr.

1662
01:47:59,370 --> 01:47:59,900
Okay.

1663
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:04,190
And he's flying around
and I'll go to the book.

1664
01:48:04,191 --> 01:48:07,850
Thompson marked several wounded people
on the ground with green smoke a signal

1665
01:48:07,851 --> 01:48:08,780
that they needed help.

1666
01:48:10,100 --> 01:48:15,100
Returning to the mee Lai area about
9:00 AM after the first refueling.

1667
01:48:16,281 --> 01:48:19,820
Thompson immediately noticed that people
who were previously injured were now

1668
01:48:19,821 --> 01:48:20,654
dead.

1669
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:25,100
There are groups of bodies as well as
many dead water buffalo over the radio.

1670
01:48:25,101 --> 01:48:29,120
He warned the gunships to fire only when
they could positively identify enemy

1671
01:48:29,121 --> 01:48:29,954
target.

1672
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:34,640
They had good visibility as they
hovered sometimes only four feet,

1673
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:39,170
five feet off the ground.
Gunner Lawrence Colburn in the doorway,

1674
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:43,310
didn't want to look at the corpses
out in the patty.

1675
01:48:43,311 --> 01:48:47,720
Fueled beside a dike 200
meters south of the village.

1676
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:52,490
They watched a small group of soldiers
approach and injured Woman Age 20 Thomson

1677
01:48:52,491 --> 01:48:53,690
had marked her with smoke.

1678
01:48:54,050 --> 01:48:58,220
They were flying close enough for Colburn
to look at her face as she lay half in

1679
01:48:58,220 --> 01:48:59,053
and half out of the dike.

1680
01:48:59,630 --> 01:49:03,380
She made a feeble gesture with her hand
and was obviously you need of help.

1681
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:05,760
Thompson put the aircraft into a stand,

1682
01:49:05,761 --> 01:49:07,910
still hover only a few
feet off the ground.

1683
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:11,210
The high gunship told the
ground forces on the radio.

1684
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:13,520
You have a wounded over
where the bubble is hovering.

1685
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:19,190
Thompson and his crew watched as an
infantry offer officer wearing captain's

1686
01:49:19,191 --> 01:49:22,970
bars on his helmet, came up to the
woman product or with his foot,

1687
01:49:23,330 --> 01:49:24,200
and then killed her.

1688
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:28,640
Those and the helicopter could
hardly believe what they were seeing.

1689
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,330
Minutes later,
over on the eastern side of the village,

1690
01:49:32,331 --> 01:49:36,890
they saw dozens of bodies in the air,
negation, ditch movements from the ditch,

1691
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:40,790
convinced them there were people
still alive, not far away.

1692
01:49:40,791 --> 01:49:43,040
A group of infantry men
taking a cigarette break,

1693
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:47,270
sat around on the ground and
relaxed taking off their steel pots.

1694
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:51,220
It was obvious there was
no fire fight taking place.

1695
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:55,990
So now what happens is,
is Thompson,

1696
01:49:56,140 --> 01:50:01,060
he's starting to get you starting to be
totally disturbed by what he's seen down

1697
01:50:01,061 --> 01:50:01,420
there.

1698
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,350
So he lands a helicopter and gets out
of the helicopter and he goes over and

1699
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:08,170
talks to a young infantry officer.

1700
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:11,920
Young infantry officer came,
came up,

1701
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:14,410
and Thompson questioned him about
what was happening on the ground.

1702
01:50:14,530 --> 01:50:17,770
The officer said there was none of his
business because he was in charge of the

1703
01:50:17,771 --> 01:50:18,640
ground troops.

1704
01:50:19,210 --> 01:50:23,050
Several members of Cali's platoon
observed Thompson's intervention.

1705
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:25,750
Kelly had gone to speak with
the bubble helicopter pilot.

1706
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:30,820
Stanley overheard Cali telling sledge
forward sledge afterward that the pilot

1707
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:33,850
hadn't liked what he'd,
what was taking place.

1708
01:50:34,270 --> 01:50:37,510
He don't like the way I'm running
the show, but I'm the boss here.

1709
01:50:38,140 --> 01:50:42,270
Olsen who wanted no part in the executions
at the irrigation ditch had moved to

1710
01:50:42,280 --> 01:50:47,080
150 meters out to the patty.
Fueled to set up a perimeter of defense.

1711
01:50:47,380 --> 01:50:52,150
He saw the pilot angrily shaking his
arms and just stipulating frustrated.

1712
01:50:52,300 --> 01:50:55,360
Thompson lifted off again and
circled the area for a few minutes.

1713
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:59,170
Almost as soon as he took off
his worst fears were confirmed

1714
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:05,110
and [inaudible] reported the sergeant was
now shooting. The people in the ditch.

1715
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:08,650
Thompson began thinking about what
the Nazis had done in the last war,

1716
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:12,850
marching people to a ditch and blowing
them away furious with himself and

1717
01:51:12,851 --> 01:51:14,770
everybody else.
He finally snapped.

1718
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:19,810
He flew over the northeast corner of the
village and spotted a group of about 10

1719
01:51:19,811 --> 01:51:23,290
civilians, including children running
towards a homemade bomb shelter,

1720
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:26,590
pursuing them or a group
of from second platoon.

1721
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:29,170
Returning to the village
from the murders expedition.

1722
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,500
Based on all he had seen in
the village that morning,

1723
01:51:32,501 --> 01:51:35,440
it was obvious to Thompson what would
happen when the troops got to the fleeing

1724
01:51:35,450 --> 01:51:36,283
civilians.

1725
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:41,230
He landed his aircraft between the
villagers and the soldiers and radioed the

1726
01:51:41,231 --> 01:51:41,741
gunships.

1727
01:51:41,741 --> 01:51:45,730
He needed help screaming to his crew
that he had to get the people out of the

1728
01:51:45,731 --> 01:51:46,121
bunker.

1729
01:51:46,121 --> 01:51:51,121
He issued an instruction that bewildered
Colburn if the Americans began shooting

1730
01:51:51,611 --> 01:51:54,970
on the villagers. Thompson said
Colburn would turn his machine gun on.

1731
01:51:54,971 --> 01:51:58,510
The Americans opened up on him,
blow him away. Thompson urged him.

1732
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:01,870
Colburn turned his gun
around to face the GIS.

1733
01:52:01,990 --> 01:52:05,230
Though he was unsure whether he would
be able to open fire on his own.

1734
01:52:05,231 --> 01:52:07,870
Men concerned for their own safety.

1735
01:52:07,871 --> 01:52:11,860
Collbran wasn't sure it was a good idea
to land in the middle of a combat zone.

1736
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:16,540
The pilot confronted, confronted the
lieutenant in charge, Steven Brooks.

1737
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:19,990
He said he wanted to help get
the peasants out of the bunker.

1738
01:52:20,080 --> 01:52:22,960
Brooks told him the only way to
do that was with hand grenades.

1739
01:52:23,740 --> 01:52:26,740
Thompson shouted that he would personally
get them out and told the lieutenant

1740
01:52:26,741 --> 01:52:28,270
to stay put.
With that,

1741
01:52:28,271 --> 01:52:32,140
he went across the bunker and gingerly
coax the civilians to come out.

1742
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:36,160
Crew members in the gunships overhead.

1743
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:40,150
Her Thompson announced over the radio
that an old man was sitting in the path of

1744
01:52:40,151 --> 01:52:42,610
the troops near the door
of a small bomb shelter.

1745
01:52:43,150 --> 01:52:44,830
Thompson's voice was choking with,

1746
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,750
he swore obscenities cursed and pleaded
with the aero crew to come down and help

1747
01:52:50,751 --> 01:52:51,950
rescue civilians.

1748
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:57,350
One pilot initially queried at the request
and Thompson threatened that if the

1749
01:52:57,351 --> 01:52:59,390
infantry open fire on the civilians,

1750
01:52:59,391 --> 01:53:02,360
his machine gunner would turn
his guns on the Americans.

1751
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:05,990
Danny millions are worn
officer on the low.

1752
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:10,790
Gunship realize the delicate nature of
the drama unfolding below and knowing

1753
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:13,760
that Thomson couldn't talk directly
with the ground troops radio,

1754
01:53:13,761 --> 01:53:18,170
the hide gun ship to tell the
infantry to stop killing millions.

1755
01:53:18,171 --> 01:53:19,130
And Brian Livingston,

1756
01:53:19,131 --> 01:53:23,600
the another pilot landed their ships
and flew the Vietnamese two men,

1757
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:28,790
two women and five or six children four
miles away to the safety of the road,

1758
01:53:28,791 --> 01:53:30,170
which ran west.

1759
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:32,763
Yeah,

1760
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:35,650
I mean it's uh,
you can't get any more drama than that.

1761
01:53:36,880 --> 01:53:41,880
And eventually Thompson gets back
to base and I'll go to the book.

1762
01:53:46,660 --> 01:53:50,950
They arrived back at Dottie at about
11:00 AM Thompson got out of the aircraft

1763
01:53:50,951 --> 01:53:52,480
and threw his helmet on the ground.

1764
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:57,490
He told his section leader what had
happened and when millions and Livingston

1765
01:53:57,491 --> 01:54:01,570
landed, they confirmed it. A group of
them sought out their company commander,

1766
01:54:02,050 --> 01:54:06,190
Major Fred Wonky in the aviation sections,
operation van.

1767
01:54:07,360 --> 01:54:11,050
They told him everything that he had seen
walk you walked up the hill to the low

1768
01:54:11,051 --> 01:54:14,770
ceiling, 10 of attack operation center
and pass the information onto barker.

1769
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:18,790
He in turn quickly got on the
radio to his executive officer,

1770
01:54:19,330 --> 01:54:20,710
Major Charles Calhoun,

1771
01:54:20,711 --> 01:54:25,060
who was flying in a helicopter over the
battlezone Calhoun was instructed to

1772
01:54:25,061 --> 01:54:27,250
find out what was happening
and get it stopped.

1773
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:30,430
There had been allegations
that civilians had been shot.

1774
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:34,210
Barker wanted assurance from Edina that
nothing of this kind was happening.

1775
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:40,680
The order went out to
Charlie company to cease fire

1776
01:54:45,960 --> 01:54:49,740
and they did.
And

1777
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:57,370
almost as quickly as it started,
it stopped.

1778
01:54:59,020 --> 01:55:03,310
And
it shows you

1779
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:08,920
that this whole time when all
this horror was taking place,

1780
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:15,950
anybody could have stopped it.
Had they stepped up

1781
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:20,300
and said something and spoke.

1782
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:23,930
Now it might've been hard for someone
that's a junior enlisted guy that's 18

1783
01:55:23,931 --> 01:55:25,550
years old that thinks he's
carrying out the mission,

1784
01:55:25,551 --> 01:55:27,350
but any of those people
in the leadership position

1785
01:55:29,390 --> 01:55:32,120
and even some of the folks that weren't
leadership positions, if you're,

1786
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:37,610
if you're there and you start to say, no,
this isn't going to be happening. I mean,

1787
01:55:37,611 --> 01:55:40,010
and you did your were some guys
on the ground that resisted,

1788
01:55:40,610 --> 01:55:42,980
but no one was able to actually stop it.

1789
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:48,240
It's one of those bizarre things
when I, when I, when I hear that,

1790
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:52,200
that all it took was that order. See
Foreign. Okay, we'll stop shooting it.

1791
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:53,443
Hmm.

1792
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,400
It shows you the power of leadership.

1793
01:55:59,280 --> 01:56:00,113
Yeah,

1794
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:03,900
and the responsibility

1795
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:09,860
of leadership.
Now as this story goes forward,

1796
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:16,030
the first thing that happens is a big
coverup and they talk about this operation

1797
01:56:17,481 --> 01:56:22,481
like it was just a great victory
over the VC and in fact a message.

1798
01:56:23,271 --> 01:56:24,140
I'm going to the book here,

1799
01:56:24,141 --> 01:56:27,140
a message of congratulations
for the pink feel operation.

1800
01:56:27,141 --> 01:56:28,070
That's what the operation is called.

1801
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:31,850
Pinkville was received from
General Westmoreland himself

1802
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,270
in a post script.

1803
01:56:36,271 --> 01:56:40,430
The brigade commander described the
me lie operation as having been an

1804
01:56:40,431 --> 01:56:41,900
outstanding success.

1805
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:47,450
The Praiseworthy Role of units and the
11th Infantry Brigade directly reflects

1806
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:51,950
your expert guidance, leadership, and
devotion to duty. He wrote to Medina,

1807
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:54,140
copying the memo to Barker.

1808
01:56:55,600 --> 01:57:00,280
The quick response and professionalism
displayed during this action has enhanced

1809
01:57:00,281 --> 01:57:03,340
the brigades image in the
eyes of higher commands.

1810
01:57:05,440 --> 01:57:09,400
So there you go.
Within a few hours,

1811
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:14,350
the army's PR machine was pumping out
a colorful image of daring do by the

1812
01:57:14,351 --> 01:57:15,580
American troops.

1813
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:22,320
The Mac v Communique issued
later the same day from Saigon,

1814
01:57:22,321 --> 01:57:23,310
gave brief details.

1815
01:57:23,311 --> 01:57:28,311
The operation announcing that American
division forces had killed 128 enemy,

1816
01:57:29,190 --> 01:57:31,710
six miles northeast of quieting city.

1817
01:57:32,340 --> 01:57:37,340
US troops surrounded reds kill 128 and
there was another headline that went out

1818
01:57:38,911 --> 01:57:42,570
that said,
TF barker crushes enemy's stronghold.

1819
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:47,220
That attitude continues now Barker,

1820
01:57:47,610 --> 01:57:52,610
the battalion commander ends up
being killed before he's killed

1821
01:57:55,470 --> 01:57:59,190
his. He releases his
assessment of the operation,

1822
01:57:59,191 --> 01:58:02,940
and this is where you start to see a seat
cover up written all over this. Here's,

1823
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:05,700
here's barkers official report.

1824
01:58:07,020 --> 01:58:10,050
This operation was well planned,
well executed and successful,

1825
01:58:10,290 --> 01:58:14,850
friendly casualties were light and the
enemy suffered heavily on this operation.

1826
01:58:14,851 --> 01:58:18,840
The civilian population supporting the
VC in the area and numbered approximately

1827
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:23,250
200. This created a problem and population
control and medical care of those

1828
01:58:23,251 --> 01:58:26,610
civilians caught in the fire
of opposing forces. However,

1829
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:30,810
the infantry unit on the ground and
helicopters were able to assist civilians

1830
01:58:30,811 --> 01:58:35,811
and leaving the area and in caring for
and or evacuating the wounded just lies,

1831
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:41,650
just lies. Then another, another, uh,

1832
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:44,680
piece.
Barker was generally concerned,

1833
01:58:44,860 --> 01:58:48,490
genuinely concerned that civilians
be protected in future operations.

1834
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:52,000
And there's no way he could have known
that dreadful atrocity being committed by

1835
01:58:52,001 --> 01:58:53,830
Charlie company at the
time it was happening.

1836
01:58:54,040 --> 01:58:57,550
But it's clear he quickly
became part of the coverup.

1837
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:01,570
He knew civilians had
died and a lot of them

1838
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:07,340
now the, so, so this starts to
gain a little bit of traction.

1839
01:59:07,341 --> 01:59:09,440
People are starting to talk about,
there's rumors.

1840
01:59:09,441 --> 01:59:14,420
So even though these big nice headlines
come out and the official report comes

1841
01:59:14,421 --> 01:59:16,340
out,
but people start to know about it.

1842
01:59:17,180 --> 01:59:21,290
And so they start sending Charlie
company in all kinds of crazy long term

1843
01:59:21,291 --> 01:59:25,790
operations out in the field and they
start to feel like, well, go to the book.

1844
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,690
Gis felt they were being sent out in,

1845
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,550
in the hopes that they
all might be killed.

1846
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:33,930
They tried to bury us
out there with Merck.

1847
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:37,340
Bitterly remembered after me lie.

1848
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:40,520
We went out in the field
for three months straight.

1849
01:59:40,940 --> 01:59:42,530
We never came back into the villages.

1850
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:45,320
Our trips to the base camps
were few and far between.

1851
01:59:45,860 --> 01:59:48,980
They had a problem and dealt
with us by trying to hide out,

1852
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:53,690
hide us out in the jungle, hoping
we'd all get killed. But we didn't.

1853
01:59:59,130 --> 02:00:03,900
So a guy, like I said,
people are talking about it.

1854
02:00:03,901 --> 02:00:04,920
There's rumors about it.

1855
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:10,160
And there's a guy named ride an hour
who checks in to Charlie company and he

1856
02:00:12,361 --> 02:00:15,450
starts hearing stories. He starts
hearing stories. He starts,

1857
02:00:15,451 --> 02:00:17,070
they start telling them,
they start talking.

1858
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:19,320
And this is why you can't
ever cover anything up.

1859
02:00:19,470 --> 02:00:21,210
This is why coverups never work.

1860
02:00:21,211 --> 02:00:24,090
Never try and cover anything up because
it's going to come. It's gonna come out,

1861
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:27,420
it's going to come out. If
you try and cover something
up, it's going to come out.

1862
02:00:27,421 --> 02:00:29,850
That's the way it works.
So

1863
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:36,240
this guy a ride an hour after he
hears enough and he talks to all these

1864
02:00:36,241 --> 02:00:39,630
different people that are more involved
and they tell them what they did and

1865
02:00:39,631 --> 02:00:43,170
what went down. And he kind of
gathers all that information.

1866
02:00:43,890 --> 02:00:48,540
And here we go back to the book
riding Hauer. He writes a letter,

1867
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:52,770
he writes a letter that explains what
he had learned, what he'd found out.

1868
02:00:53,430 --> 02:00:57,840
And here we go, right? And Hauer
posted the letter on April 2nd,

1869
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:02,180
1969 to you doll and 30
prominent men in Washington DC,

1870
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:07,080
including President Nixon, the
secretary defense, Melvin Laird,

1871
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:10,890
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
staff, Edward Kennedy, Barry Goldwater,

1872
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:13,080
Eugene McCarthy,
and William Fulbright.

1873
02:01:14,100 --> 02:01:17,520
He sent the letters registered mail
thinking that staff opening them would be

1874
02:01:17,521 --> 02:01:20,250
bound to take the comments,
the contents more seriously.

1875
02:01:20,670 --> 02:01:24,030
And here's a little excerpt from the,
from the letter gentlemen.

1876
02:01:24,870 --> 02:01:27,810
It was in late April,

1877
02:01:27,810 --> 02:01:31,320
1968 that I first heard of Pinkville
and what allegedly happened there.

1878
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:35,850
I received that first
report with some skepticism,

1879
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:40,010
but in the following months I was to
hear similar stories from such a wide

1880
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:43,880
variety of people that it
became impossible for me to
disbelieve that something

1881
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:48,881
rather dark and bloody did
indeed occur sometime in March,

1882
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:53,540
1968 in a village called Pinkville
in the Republic of Vietnam.

1883
02:01:59,010 --> 02:02:02,070
So that's how the story breaks there.

1884
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:05,670
Start to investigate
it within the Pentagon.

1885
02:02:05,671 --> 02:02:08,010
They start to investigate it as great.
This book is Great.

1886
02:02:08,011 --> 02:02:12,210
It goes into a ton of detail on what
that's like, how that takes place,

1887
02:02:12,690 --> 02:02:17,500
the people that are running it and
there's good, honest, solid, you know,

1888
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:20,520
army leadership that says,
oh no, we're going to,

1889
02:02:20,550 --> 02:02:22,380
we're going to find out what
happened and we're going to,

1890
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:23,850
we're going to do something about it.

1891
02:02:24,750 --> 02:02:27,300
So the cover up isn't
throughout the chain of command.

1892
02:02:27,301 --> 02:02:30,090
There's people that that try
and put a stop to it. Now,

1893
02:02:30,150 --> 02:02:32,790
the other thing that turns very

1894
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:37,380
interesting on this is obviously
when it hits the public,

1895
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:43,580
and one of the most shocking impacts
to the public took place on television.

1896
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:46,680
And,
and if you remember at this time,

1897
02:02:46,740 --> 02:02:49,950
and I don't know if this was like for
for you because you're a little bit

1898
02:02:49,951 --> 02:02:54,630
younger than me, but when I was a kid,
we had three TV channels. You know,

1899
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:59,660
there was no 57 or 147 or 1000 TV
channels and there was no internet.

1900
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:02,980
We didn't really,
there wasn't really radio shows anymore.

1901
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:05,700
So if the family was going
to do something at night,

1902
02:03:05,730 --> 02:03:09,330
at six o'clock at night or seven
o'clock at night together after dinner,

1903
02:03:09,930 --> 02:03:11,910
there was a good chance they were
going to sit down and watch TV.

1904
02:03:12,260 --> 02:03:16,470
And now you go back this 1969 so
it's even more focused on television.

1905
02:03:18,540 --> 02:03:23,540
And so what happens is this story
breaks on TV with an interview,

1906
02:03:24,330 --> 02:03:26,520
and I'll go to the book with me.
Those confession

1907
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:33,220
television was for most
Americans, quintessentially
a medium of entertainment.

1908
02:03:33,970 --> 02:03:38,970
Milos confession was truly
an extraordinary departure
from the vapid diet of

1909
02:03:39,071 --> 02:03:43,840
soap operas, comedy programs,
and quiz shows. News, however,

1910
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:48,760
was important to American
audiences. Walter Cronkite
was a national institution.

1911
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:54,100
Milos interview was delivered virtually
without warning to an audience of

1912
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:59,020
millions of parents and children
waiting excitedly for news of Apollo 12

1913
02:03:59,021 --> 02:04:03,160
astronauts returned from the moon and
the splashed down into the Pacific Ocean.

1914
02:04:04,030 --> 02:04:05,920
So that's what that everyone thinks.
That's where they're going to, oh,

1915
02:04:05,921 --> 02:04:10,090
let's get the kids to watch the news and
we'll find out about Yay. Yay America,

1916
02:04:10,930 --> 02:04:15,080
back to the book. Instead, their
living rooms appeared. The GOC,

1917
02:04:15,081 --> 02:04:18,730
his figure of a young man from Indiana,
me low,

1918
02:04:18,731 --> 02:04:22,120
brought to the audience are
raw truth about Vietnam.

1919
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:24,760
They would prefer not to have known.

1920
02:04:25,450 --> 02:04:29,770
He chillingly described lining up
first the first group of villagers and

1921
02:04:29,771 --> 02:04:33,520
shooting them down, expanding four
clips of ammunition in the killing.

1922
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:36,610
There were 17 bullets to a clip,

1923
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:40,860
which Wallace deducted deduced 68 shots

1924
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:44,250
at the ditch execution site.

1925
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:48,450
Me Lo said he was ordered to fire
single shots to conserve ammunition.

1926
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:52,740
Wallace wanted to know why he did it

1927
02:04:55,870 --> 02:04:58,060
and here's the interview.
Why did I do it?

1928
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:03,900
Because I felt like I was ordered to do
it and it seemed like that at the time I

1929
02:05:04,031 --> 02:05:07,810
felt like I was doing the right
thing because I lost buddies.

1930
02:05:07,930 --> 02:05:11,920
I lost a damn good buddy, Bobby
Wilson, and it was on my conscience.

1931
02:05:12,610 --> 02:05:14,590
So after I'd done it,
I felt good,

1932
02:05:15,370 --> 02:05:18,730
but later on that day
it was getting to me.

1933
02:05:20,030 --> 02:05:20,800
Yeah,

1934
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,540
you're married,
right?

1935
02:05:23,080 --> 02:05:26,380
Children to how old?

1936
02:05:27,040 --> 02:05:31,750
The boy is two and a half and the
little girl is a year and a half. Well,

1937
02:05:31,751 --> 02:05:36,370
obviously the question comes to mind.
The father of two little kids like that.

1938
02:05:36,490 --> 02:05:40,240
How can he shoot babies?
I didn't have the little girl.

1939
02:05:40,330 --> 02:05:44,530
I just had the little boy at the time.
How do you shoot babies?

1940
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,370
I don't know.
It's just one of them things.

1941
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,610
How many people would you
imagine were killed that day?

1942
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:57,400
I would say three 70
what did these civilians,

1943
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:01,000
these, particularly the women and
children, the old man. What did they do?

1944
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:05,890
What did they say to you? Were they
weren't begging or anything? No. No,

1945
02:06:05,950 --> 02:06:09,970
or right. They were
begging and saying, no, no,

1946
02:06:10,120 --> 02:06:14,020
and their mothers were hugging their
children, but they kept on firing.

1947
02:06:15,010 --> 02:06:19,660
Well, we kept on firing. They was
waving their arms and begging.

1948
02:06:21,820 --> 02:06:26,200
Did you ever dream about all this
that went on and Pinkville? Yes,

1949
02:06:26,201 --> 02:06:31,060
I did and I still dream about it.
What kind of dreams?

1950
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:35,620
I see the women and children
in my sleep some days.

1951
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:38,500
Some nights I can't sleep.

1952
02:06:39,940 --> 02:06:41,440
I just lay there thinking about it.
Yeah.

1953
02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:44,630
Yeah,

1954
02:06:44,630 --> 02:06:46,300
so that's not exactly the,

1955
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:50,090
the friendly news that you're expecting
to see about the Apollo mission.

1956
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:57,160
Now
this thing goes to trial and again,

1957
02:06:57,161 --> 02:07:00,010
you got to get into the book to
see how all this breaks down,

1958
02:07:00,910 --> 02:07:02,170
but a couple highlights.

1959
02:07:02,320 --> 02:07:06,430
Here's lieutenant Calley
during the trial and how he,

1960
02:07:06,460 --> 02:07:11,380
how he testified on what he did

1961
02:07:13,340 --> 02:07:17,290
and it's a good insight into his mindset.
Here we go. Key lieutenant Calley.

1962
02:07:17,470 --> 02:07:22,000
I was ordered to go in there and destroy
the enemy. That was my job that day.

1963
02:07:22,120 --> 02:07:26,560
That was my mission. I was given. I did
not sit down and think in terms of men,

1964
02:07:26,561 --> 02:07:29,410
women, and children, they
were all classified the same.

1965
02:07:29,530 --> 02:07:33,820
And that was the classification that
we dealt with just as enemy soldiers.

1966
02:07:34,210 --> 02:07:36,310
I felt then,
and I still do that.

1967
02:07:36,311 --> 02:07:40,270
I acted as I was directed and I carried
out the orders that I was given and I do

1968
02:07:40,271 --> 02:07:44,710
not feel wrong in doing so.
And

1969
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:46,153
Yeah,

1970
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:52,140
you know, we, we get very used
to the, uh, the media. I mean,

1971
02:07:52,141 --> 02:07:55,590
we're in a media circus nowadays
because there's so much media.

1972
02:07:55,770 --> 02:07:59,460
There's social media, there's cable media,
there's internet media. I mean, we get,

1973
02:07:59,550 --> 02:08:02,880
there's a circus of media
now and you get a lot,

1974
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:05,460
I would say you can get a
lot more distracted. I mean,

1975
02:08:05,461 --> 02:08:07,710
new stories here don't last that long,
but this was,

1976
02:08:07,770 --> 02:08:12,770
this was a big news story and it was
really dividing the country in a way,

1977
02:08:13,710 --> 02:08:16,590
even more so than the country has
already been divided by the Vietnam War.

1978
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:20,970
But in, I'll go to the book
here. To many Americans,

1979
02:08:21,120 --> 02:08:25,470
Cali was a hero and they believed
that with the guilty verdict,

1980
02:08:25,471 --> 02:08:29,040
he was found guilty. A great injustice
had been perpetrated upon the army.

1981
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:34,460
And in Vietnam they gave an example here
in Vietnam that soldiers at case on had

1982
02:08:35,761 --> 02:08:40,761
hastily raised defiance sign that
said a troop first Cav solutes,

1983
02:08:42,451 --> 02:08:47,230
William Calley.
So you got people that are saying,

1984
02:08:47,231 --> 02:08:50,650
Hey, what, you know, Kelly was,
Kelly did the right thing out there.

1985
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:53,930
On top of that,
uh,

1986
02:08:53,950 --> 02:08:57,690
this was a good example of what the
attitude of some Americans were at,

1987
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:00,130
was at a,

1988
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:05,260
a World War II veteran went into an
army recruiting office in Mobile,

1989
02:09:05,261 --> 02:09:08,380
Alabama to make an extraordinary request.

1990
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,230
He had flown bombing
missions over Germany,

1991
02:09:11,231 --> 02:09:15,340
which had killed innocent civilians and
wanted to be arrested for war crimes

1992
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:17,760
despite in,

1993
02:09:17,761 --> 02:09:21,220
and another good example
that somebody sent a goat,

1994
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:26,060
a Billy goat of living Billy goat and
send it to the White House and it had a

1995
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:30,910
jacket on and the jacket said,
scape goat on it. And this, this is,

1996
02:09:31,090 --> 02:09:32,050
this is pretty cool.

1997
02:09:32,051 --> 02:09:37,030
The response that the army
and the government had to
this Kelly is not a scape

1998
02:09:37,031 --> 02:09:42,031
goat nor a poor lieutenant singled out
to bear the entire burden of a difficult

1999
02:09:42,641 --> 02:09:43,474
war.

2000
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:49,080
Declared a high level army memorandum
circling amongst senior staff at the White

2001
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:50,050
House,

2002
02:09:50,050 --> 02:09:55,050
his act stand alone in infamy among known
atrocities for the US forces in a war.

2003
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:00,340
If Kelly is let go or let
off with a slap on the wrist,

2004
02:10:00,490 --> 02:10:03,880
the message to all soldiers
must read anything goes.

2005
02:10:05,200 --> 02:10:06,730
The implications for the army,

2006
02:10:06,850 --> 02:10:10,330
let alone the nation are incalculable,

2007
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:13,000
but clearly in tolerable.

2008
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:15,250
Okay,

2009
02:10:15,250 --> 02:10:19,900
so they did a hold the line
and recognize that that

2010
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:23,840
that this was not good.

2011
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:29,300
And at the same time you still got
these people that were saying that,

2012
02:10:29,301 --> 02:10:33,770
look, this is, this is a
war and here's, here's a,

2013
02:10:33,810 --> 02:10:37,310
a quote from the book
take by way of example,

2014
02:10:37,311 --> 02:10:42,311
the following the American soldier in an
officially sanctioned wrath is a thing

2015
02:10:42,321 --> 02:10:47,240
so ugly in dangerous that it would
take a Kipling to describe him.

2016
02:10:48,630 --> 02:10:53,130
Not a description of me lie,
but the observation of James h blunt,

2017
02:10:53,131 --> 02:10:57,150
a young lieutenant later to come later
to become a judge on the behavior of

2018
02:10:57,151 --> 02:11:00,180
troops in the Philippines
60 years before Vietnam.

2019
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:05,340
Here's another comment about
what that war was like.

2020
02:11:05,370 --> 02:11:08,910
The the war in the Philippines.
Our men have been relentless,

2021
02:11:08,940 --> 02:11:13,290
have killed to exterminate men, women
and children, prisoners and captives,

2022
02:11:13,410 --> 02:11:18,410
active insurgents and suspected people
from lads have 10 up in idea prevailing

2023
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:23,340
that the Filipino was
little better than a dog.

2024
02:11:24,780 --> 02:11:29,780
And another comparison here from the
book in the Dakotas General William

2025
02:11:32,010 --> 02:11:35,040
Tecumseh Sherman had written to
General Ulysses Ulysses s grant.

2026
02:11:35,250 --> 02:11:37,260
We must act with vindictive,

2027
02:11:37,320 --> 02:11:42,090
earn earnestness against the
Su even to the extermination,

2028
02:11:42,240 --> 02:11:47,100
men, women and children. Nothing else.
We'll reach the root of the case.

2029
02:11:47,170 --> 02:11:51,540
It was talking about the Indian
wars there. And then another one,

2030
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:57,740
just a description that sort of
explains how horrible war is.

2031
02:12:00,270 --> 02:12:03,630
And this one was from World War II.
What kind of award to civilian?

2032
02:12:03,631 --> 02:12:07,170
Suppose we fought anyways,
we shot prisoners in cold blood,

2033
02:12:07,350 --> 02:12:12,120
wiped out hospitals, strafed light
lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy.

2034
02:12:12,121 --> 02:12:14,430
Civilians finished off the enemy wounded,

2035
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:18,930
toss the dying into a hole with the dead
and in the Pacific boiled the flesh off

2036
02:12:18,931 --> 02:12:19,321
enemies,

2037
02:12:19,321 --> 02:12:23,580
skulls to make table ornaments
for sweethearts or carved
their bones into letter

2038
02:12:23,581 --> 02:12:24,414
openers.

2039
02:12:25,690 --> 02:12:26,270
Okay.

2040
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:30,260
That was written by an American
warp corresponded, Edward L. Jones.

2041
02:12:34,150 --> 02:12:34,983
Okay.

2042
02:12:35,730 --> 02:12:36,563
Now

2043
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:43,340
where were those where those ideas
become so disturbing and again,

2044
02:12:45,570 --> 02:12:49,650
W war is hell,
war is dark or is evil.

2045
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:53,880
How the things happen.
And again,

2046
02:12:53,881 --> 02:12:55,800
when you have a lack of leadership,

2047
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:00,180
things get even worse

2048
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:06,820
and it can happen even to
these apparently normal guys.

2049
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:13,220
And here's Michael Bernhardt talking
about what it was like in what he thought

2050
02:13:14,010 --> 02:13:18,480
of people after he got home. I had seen
people who look like everybody else,

2051
02:13:18,570 --> 02:13:23,570
normal people doing atrocious things and
I really wasn't sure how anyone would

2052
02:13:24,541 --> 02:13:28,920
have acted in the same situation.
I thought I knew human nature.

2053
02:13:29,250 --> 02:13:32,340
I thought that people were basically good,
that they couldn't do this.

2054
02:13:32,490 --> 02:13:35,730
I thought most of the values
people held were pretty solid.

2055
02:13:36,330 --> 02:13:41,330
That when we defined things as good or
bad that they were good or bad and that

2056
02:13:42,271 --> 02:13:44,220
we would know when
something was really bad,

2057
02:13:45,580 --> 02:13:48,400
but I had seen that this was not the case.

2058
02:13:49,270 --> 02:13:51,430
I wasn't sure I could trust anyone.
Again,

2059
02:13:51,610 --> 02:13:56,230
I wasn't sure I could ever get close to
anyone or confide in anyone very closely

2060
02:13:56,231 --> 02:13:57,820
because of what I'd seen over there.

2061
02:14:00,160 --> 02:14:03,290
And going back to the leadership piece,
and this is from the book,

2062
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:08,630
what steps were taken to Holt,
the run of beatings, thefts,

2063
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:11,210
rapes,
tortures and murder,

2064
02:14:11,660 --> 02:14:16,660
which prodded Charlie company
down the road to me lie none.

2065
02:14:18,410 --> 02:14:23,060
Who among the chain of command that found
on its bottom rung Lieutenant William

2066
02:14:23,060 --> 02:14:24,800
Calley and rose through Medina Barker,

2067
02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:29,540
Henderson and cost or gave any kind of
moral lead or example that might have

2068
02:14:29,541 --> 02:14:34,340
prevented the moral destruction
of the company? No one

2069
02:14:36,510 --> 02:14:41,190
in place of clear leadership.
There was paper leadership,

2070
02:14:41,970 --> 02:14:43,380
the rules of engagement,

2071
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:47,280
numerous codes of conduct
and all other directives,

2072
02:14:47,281 --> 02:14:51,330
all of which contained
the loftiest intentions.

2073
02:14:53,030 --> 02:14:55,550
There was nothing wrong with
these regulations and spirit.

2074
02:14:55,551 --> 02:14:59,120
They were a recognizable expression
of the American ideal at war.

2075
02:14:59,330 --> 02:15:02,870
A blueprint for order
in the midst of hell.

2076
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:09,630
They simply never became
part of the soldiers reality
because they weren't never

2077
02:15:10,570 --> 02:15:14,470
seriously in forced and
without emphatic enforcement.

2078
02:15:14,471 --> 02:15:19,471
They corresponded as much to the world
of the common grunt as roadmaps of Mars.

2079
02:15:24,630 --> 02:15:25,463
That

2080
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:29,960
total lack of leadership,

2081
02:15:31,880 --> 02:15:34,340
that lack of moral courage

2082
02:15:38,990 --> 02:15:39,823
and

2083
02:15:40,100 --> 02:15:40,933
okay,

2084
02:15:41,530 --> 02:15:45,700
as we close this out, it goes in
the book here and says, once again,

2085
02:15:45,701 --> 02:15:48,280
the darker side of war
has gone underground.

2086
02:15:49,330 --> 02:15:53,020
Me Lie is no longer a
public burden or concern.

2087
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:57,820
The burden of guilt and the burden of
responsibility have fallen onto the

2088
02:15:57,821 --> 02:16:01,660
soldiers themselves.
Shit,

2089
02:16:01,870 --> 02:16:04,300
that man of Charlie company
used to tell each other

2090
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:07,250
rolls down hill

2091
02:16:10,140 --> 02:16:13,890
and we'll close out with the words from

2092
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,690
Varnado Simpson.

2093
02:16:18,950 --> 02:16:19,780
Okay,

2094
02:16:19,780 --> 02:16:23,200
who's in his own little private
hell with his memories of this?

2095
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:28,470
As you sit shaking from side to side in
his chair alone in his house in Jackson,

2096
02:16:29,170 --> 02:16:30,100
Mississippi,

2097
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:33,850
how can you forgive?

2098
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:37,680
I can't forgive myself for the things,

2099
02:16:38,820 --> 02:16:41,370
even though I know that it was
something that I was told to do,

2100
02:16:41,520 --> 02:16:46,410
but how can I forget that or forgive?
It's easy for you to say,

2101
02:16:46,411 --> 02:16:48,900
well,
go ahead with your life,

2102
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:54,210
but how can you go ahead with your
life when this is holding you back?

2103
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:59,490
I can't put my mind to
anything. Yes, I'm ashamed.

2104
02:16:59,640 --> 02:17:03,600
I'm sorry I'm guilty,
but I did it.

2105
02:17:05,130 --> 02:17:09,080
You know,
what else can I tell you?

2106
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:16,560
It happened.
It happened

2107
02:17:22,640 --> 02:17:23,473
it as we

2108
02:17:27,180 --> 02:17:28,230
think about this book

2109
02:17:29,870 --> 02:17:33,390
and you should go and get this book and
you should read this book and you should

2110
02:17:33,391 --> 02:17:38,391
experience this level of darkness in the
world so that we can all remember to be

2111
02:17:42,720 --> 02:17:43,710
vigilant

2112
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:49,010
against this power of darkness,
which,

2113
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:52,793
okay,

2114
02:17:52,800 --> 02:17:55,800
I suppose we have to admit

2115
02:17:57,680 --> 02:18:01,010
that that darkness is in every man's soul

2116
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:08,150
lurking
and waiting,

2117
02:18:08,600 --> 02:18:11,090
waiting for a moment to strike out.

2118
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:19,460
But we,
we need to counter that.

2119
02:18:22,390 --> 02:18:25,540
We need to counter that,
that evil

2120
02:18:29,210 --> 02:18:31,850
with good.

2121
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:36,050
And we need to do that with
the power of leadership.

2122
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:42,010
And you can see in these situations where
leaders led men to do things that they

2123
02:18:42,801 --> 02:18:45,200
knew were wrong.
They knew they were wrong,

2124
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,330
things that they didn't want to do.

2125
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:55,370
Killing children as tears are
streaming down their faces.

2126
02:18:55,670 --> 02:18:59,450
And if you can lead men to do
things that they know are wrong,

2127
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:04,580
imagine the power and the influence you
have as a leader to lead people to do

2128
02:19:05,031 --> 02:19:09,800
things that are right and that people
know are right in that are good

2129
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:19,170
and you are leader.
I am a leader.

2130
02:19:19,230 --> 02:19:24,030
No matter what your station in
life or your position or your rank,

2131
02:19:24,180 --> 02:19:28,400
you are a leader.
When you step up and lead,

2132
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:34,810
you are a leader and you can make a
difference and you can have an impact and

2133
02:19:36,271 --> 02:19:41,160
you can affect the outcomes
of so many things in the world

2134
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:48,030
by stepping up
and leading.

2135
02:19:50,730 --> 02:19:55,530
Oh Way from the evil in a way.
From the darkness.

2136
02:19:58,330 --> 02:19:59,163
Yeah,

2137
02:19:59,820 --> 02:20:00,780
and toward the light.

2138
02:20:08,720 --> 02:20:09,150
Okay.

2139
02:20:09,150 --> 02:20:10,320
Then I know that was a,

2140
02:20:14,390 --> 02:20:17,480
that's a rough book and
this is a rough podcast.

2141
02:20:19,150 --> 02:20:19,983
Okay.

2142
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,890
In, in, like I said, I was,

2143
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:26,030
I was questioning whether
to actually do this or not.

2144
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,073
Okay.

2145
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:31,040
In in at certain points
when I was reading this,

2146
02:20:31,130 --> 02:20:34,100
I mean this is my fourth time reading it,
I think,

2147
02:20:34,780 --> 02:20:39,780
and even when I was reading it just
now on the podcast for this recording,

2148
02:20:42,830 --> 02:20:47,090
I could,
I could hear a numbness in my voice.

2149
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:51,980
I could hear it as I'm talking about the
killing and the gunning down and the f

2150
02:20:52,220 --> 02:20:54,320
eight so much,

2151
02:20:57,570 --> 02:20:59,040
and I know it's going to be brutal.

2152
02:20:59,041 --> 02:21:03,550
I know people are going to be impacted
by this and maybe not everyone's going to

2153
02:21:03,560 --> 02:21:05,280
make it through this
and I understand that,

2154
02:21:08,070 --> 02:21:10,110
but we owe it to ourselves

2155
02:21:11,740 --> 02:21:16,740
to know history and to know and understand
evil and to understand how quickly it

2156
02:21:21,161 --> 02:21:26,161
can come about and to see these
indicators and to know that if you're in a

2157
02:21:26,411 --> 02:21:28,810
leadership position,
you start to see things going sideways.

2158
02:21:28,811 --> 02:21:33,790
You've got to put a stop to them before
they get out of hand before they turn

2159
02:21:33,791 --> 02:21:34,750
into this.

2160
02:21:35,410 --> 02:21:36,243
Hmm.

2161
02:21:40,990 --> 02:21:45,940
Maybe at some point we'll look for
some topics that are a little bit more,

2162
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:53,460
I guess, lighthearted, lighthearted, eh,

2163
02:21:53,480 --> 02:21:56,540
but I'll tell you what my only issue
with that is you want a topic that's

2164
02:21:56,550 --> 02:22:00,890
lighthearted. You can find them anywhere.
You can go get him anywhere. There's a,

2165
02:22:00,980 --> 02:22:01,813
there's a whole,

2166
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:05,660
actually there's a whole section
for a podcast that's called comedy,

2167
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:09,320
right?
It's called comedy that that exists.

2168
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:12,110
There's no section that says the darkness,
I guess there is one.

2169
02:22:12,111 --> 02:22:14,660
It's called Jocko podcast.
You want to hear about the darkness,

2170
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:17,210
you want to hear about things that are
going on in the world that aren't good.

2171
02:22:17,540 --> 02:22:20,630
This is it here where the people
that are dealing with reality,

2172
02:22:23,260 --> 02:22:24,000
okay.

2173
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,560
You know, I know this, this is for
everybody and that's okay. That's okay.

2174
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:29,911
You know,

2175
02:22:29,911 --> 02:22:34,911
we're talking about heavy topics here in
the reason we're talking about the dark

2176
02:22:35,791 --> 02:22:39,240
is because we want to be enlightened.
We want to know about

2177
02:22:40,180 --> 02:22:41,110
these things.

2178
02:22:45,100 --> 02:22:49,450
I don't think we're going to have time
for Q and a because I just talked about

2179
02:22:49,451 --> 02:22:53,790
that book for a really long time.
Um,

2180
02:22:54,580 --> 02:22:59,410
so what we'll do is do a Q and
a for the next podcast. And

2181
02:23:00,910 --> 02:23:04,900
for this one we'll let
it stand on its own.

2182
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:12,690
And I know it might be a rough podcast
to think about wanting to hear more of

2183
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:17,610
them, but if you do want to hear
more of these podcasts, Echo,

2184
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:22,200
what can these folks do to
support the podcasts? Well,

2185
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,300
as I always recommend,
sure, support the podcast,

2186
02:23:27,390 --> 02:23:31,740
but you can also support
yourself with supplementation

2187
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:36,510
on it, on it has the best supplements. Uh,

2188
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:41,540
the actual supplements that I take
chocolate takes on it.com/jocko,

2189
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:47,310
you can get 10% off. So support yourself
physically and financially in that way.

2190
02:23:48,070 --> 02:23:51,840
Um, I would recommend,
what do you think? Well,

2191
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:55,830
what's the number one you think Krill oil?

2192
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:00,660
I think it depends on who you are. I
thank you for you. [inaudible] Krill oil.

2193
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:05,610
All you, uh, uh, alphabet I like. Yeah,

2194
02:24:05,611 --> 02:24:08,380
and they're just a anyway, so
Alpha brain, good for your brain,

2195
02:24:08,410 --> 02:24:11,340
makes you think quicker. It makes you
like you did you just say Alpha brain?

2196
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:14,910
Cause I got the whole song right here
for me as Jocko drinks off of brain

2197
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:18,510
instant, by the way. Um, it
makes you think, you know,

2198
02:24:18,511 --> 02:24:20,580
like when you search for
words, like in your, you know,

2199
02:24:20,581 --> 02:24:24,670
when you're trying to think of a
word sometimes. Yes, yes. From brain.

2200
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:29,000
You feel like Levy pathways to them, the
words a little bit closer. Yeah, yeah,

2201
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:34,080
yeah. Actually you can read all about,
it's called a nootropic Alpha brain. Yes.

2202
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:38,760
Good free rein anyway. A
krill oil goodfree joints.
That's the one Jocko takes.

2203
02:24:38,761 --> 02:24:40,620
That's why he's so functional.

2204
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:45,100
I would say for lack of a better term
proving channel. I like that word though.

2205
02:24:46,110 --> 02:24:50,230
And warrior bars, that's a new one
right there. The warrior bores that.

2206
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:53,040
That's not like some, you know,
they, they've been having,

2207
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:54,780
well actually nootropics
pretty it needs to,

2208
02:24:54,781 --> 02:24:57,270
but you know how you have protein
powder that's been around,

2209
02:24:57,450 --> 02:24:58,650
but where are your party?
That's a,

2210
02:24:58,651 --> 02:25:01,680
that's a new twist on things that
good about what's good about,

2211
02:25:01,681 --> 02:25:04,440
like you talked about protein powder.
That's like a powder, right? Well,

2212
02:25:04,441 --> 02:25:08,460
you get a protein bar,
that's a thing that's been
manufactured. Right? Like a bar.

2213
02:25:08,910 --> 02:25:12,090
Yeah. The warrior bar is
like food. Yeah. Yeah.

2214
02:25:12,120 --> 02:25:15,610
So that makes it a little
bit better in my mind. Yeah.

2215
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:17,790
It's cause I want to eat food. Yeah. So,

2216
02:25:17,791 --> 02:25:22,080
so it's kind of like in the direction
of a beef jerky situation, but more,

2217
02:25:22,081 --> 02:25:25,630
even more. Anyway, let's look
at it. The thing is there's two,

2218
02:25:25,631 --> 02:25:28,660
there's two major differences between
beer for beef jerky and warrior bar and

2219
02:25:28,661 --> 02:25:32,560
that is beef jerky, dry
warrior bar, not dry.

2220
02:25:33,370 --> 02:25:36,250
Delish. Yup. And then a shroom tech.

2221
02:25:36,251 --> 02:25:40,720
Good for like high intensity
kind of prolonged stuff. Do
Jitsu. If you're into it.

2222
02:25:40,721 --> 02:25:45,700
Wrestling, metcon met, cross fit.
Well there you go. Shroom tech.

2223
02:25:45,850 --> 02:25:50,530
Boom. Yeah, improve your output, your
performance, utilize oxygen better.

2224
02:25:50,980 --> 02:25:54,490
Anyway, it's really good.
Like really good. Um,

2225
02:25:54,491 --> 02:25:56,980
also another way to support the podcast.
If you're in the mood to,

2226
02:25:57,340 --> 02:25:59,110
before you do your Amazon shopping,

2227
02:25:59,440 --> 02:26:03,730
go to Jocko podcast.com and click on the
Amazon link. What does that cost you?

2228
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:08,970
That doesn't cost you anything except
for literally literally three seconds.

2229
02:26:08,971 --> 02:26:12,430
So your time, three seconds. And you
support the podcast. Yup. I like that.

2230
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:16,840
In one click. Maybe like a one 10th
of a calorie maybe finger clip.

2231
02:26:17,460 --> 02:26:19,180
I like that. But yeah, super easy.

2232
02:26:19,181 --> 02:26:22,640
The main thing asking people
to donate money there. No.

2233
02:26:23,270 --> 02:26:25,770
Amazon's going to donate the
money. Yeah, they're going to,

2234
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:30,610
they're going to support the podcast like
collective. Yeah, it's good. Um, so boom,

2235
02:26:30,611 --> 02:26:34,300
there you go there. I guess the
main thing is to remember to do it.

2236
02:26:34,860 --> 02:26:37,110
You know when you, you're trying to
get that duct tape real quick. Oh,

2237
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:41,010
I got to make that time so he
can ship that same day. You know?

2238
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:41,560
Then you've got to,

2239
02:26:41,560 --> 02:26:44,620
you just want to maybe take some
Alpha brain that'll help you remember.

2240
02:26:44,990 --> 02:26:49,630
I like that anyway. Or, or
if you want some chocolate
stuff, like some cool shirts,

2241
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:54,190
Jocko, store.com I'm seeing a new
shirt. Is that correct here? Yes.

2242
02:26:54,191 --> 02:26:57,670
We have a new shirt. The trooper
shirt, Dutch. It's got a name.

2243
02:26:58,150 --> 02:27:02,030
Are we naming shirts now?
We have to name it.

2244
02:27:02,220 --> 02:27:05,560
So this is,
some people don't Echo Charles.

2245
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:09,760
He is an artist.
He's an artist.

2246
02:27:09,940 --> 02:27:13,980
And so that's why he has to Dame
the t shirt. Yeah. You know, you,

2247
02:27:14,090 --> 02:27:17,740
you just have to name it because that
makes you feel like it's a piece of art

2248
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:23,590
is it's a piece. Because you just said
the trooper shirt as if that's the thing.

2249
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:27,490
But here's the thing though, with this
shirt and with like with all the shirts,

2250
02:27:27,491 --> 02:27:29,650
it's not just like, well I'm going
to call it the trooper shirt.

2251
02:27:29,650 --> 02:27:32,170
Cause I think that sounds cool.
It's like there's different layers.

2252
02:27:32,171 --> 02:27:34,310
It's not just a shirt with a saying
on it. And like this, believe me,

2253
02:27:34,910 --> 02:27:37,780
it's not just, you're saying it's not
just called the trooper tee shirt.

2254
02:27:37,840 --> 02:27:41,860
It actually is. Yeah. Like we were
coming and you're wearing it right now.

2255
02:27:41,870 --> 02:27:46,750
If you're on youtube, you can
check it out. Three colors. Ooh,

2256
02:27:46,751 --> 02:27:50,230
that's a unique when usually we'll have
two tellers protest, something like that.

2257
02:27:50,440 --> 02:27:54,620
No, but you can protest it. And this
is why. So the people who signed up on,

2258
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:59,440
on the insider's group,
the email list, uh, I,

2259
02:27:59,740 --> 02:28:04,440
people that are enlisted troopers,
you know the Jocko podcast there as well.

2260
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:07,950
How do they do that?
Well, we'll jump on Jocko,

2261
02:28:07,951 --> 02:28:11,410
star.com right on the front and you just
put your email address and I don't spam,

2262
02:28:11,560 --> 02:28:13,150
that's not what it's for.
This is what it's for.

2263
02:28:13,160 --> 02:28:16,270
This is one of the things that it was
for and the people who are on the list

2264
02:28:16,310 --> 02:28:19,030
notice where,
hey,

2265
02:28:19,031 --> 02:28:23,260
I got a new shirt design
idea. You know, uh,

2266
02:28:24,230 --> 02:28:27,560
I don't know what colors really to
what are the best colors, right?

2267
02:28:27,590 --> 02:28:31,310
I know what colors I like. Yeah,
I'll do a black one. I'll do. But,

2268
02:28:31,311 --> 02:28:35,060
so what I did was I sent an email to
everybody instead of what, here's what,

2269
02:28:35,061 --> 02:28:37,400
here's the design,
here's what it kind of will look like.

2270
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:40,820
What color shirts are we doing? What color
shirts do you guys like? So there's a,

2271
02:28:40,880 --> 02:28:45,110
there was a vote. There was input
received. Yes. Yeah. Like, uh, yeah.

2272
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:49,700
And the consensus was these three
colors, like a dark red. Oh.

2273
02:28:50,030 --> 02:28:52,400
Which actually turned out
even better than I thought,

2274
02:28:52,401 --> 02:28:56,840
and I was enthusiastic about
the red and the Odi Green.

2275
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:59,570
I support Odie green
that way if you have to,

2276
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:01,420
you never know when you
might have to go tactical

2277
02:29:04,390 --> 02:29:05,290
purpose things,

2278
02:29:05,610 --> 02:29:10,130
things that can be good for normal
situations or tactical situations.

2279
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:12,320
That's why I like Odie green tee shirts.
Yeah.

2280
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:16,310
Just in case you get a spring into
getting after it spontaneously.

2281
02:29:16,490 --> 02:29:19,490
And then of course we've got the black,
but that was the consensus overall.

2282
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:23,540
The green there was a charcoal
had a strong strong, um, you know,

2283
02:29:24,260 --> 02:29:28,820
but uh, yeah. Is the green, the red and
the black. But anyway, yeah, it's a cool,

2284
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:33,470
check it out if you want to
look at the details of it
there. Um, yeah, you're good.

2285
02:29:33,560 --> 02:29:36,620
Anyway. If you want to support
the podcast that way, get a shirt.

2286
02:29:36,740 --> 02:29:41,360
This trooper shirt isn't the only
one, but man, I, I, I'm pretty,

2287
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:44,390
I'm pretty fired up about it.
It looks good. I think. Anyway,

2288
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:49,840
there's other ones on there too that are
cool and a coffee mugs and stickers if

2289
02:29:50,931 --> 02:29:54,990
you're down. I like, but yeah, that's
the way, those are the ways and uh,

2290
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:59,810
for the people who have been
and do Dang to say thank you.

2291
02:29:59,811 --> 02:30:02,900
It'd be like not even
doing it halfway justice.

2292
02:30:02,970 --> 02:30:06,510
Yeah, definitely. Thanks everybody
I feel for doing that. And you know,

2293
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:07,420
you know what's weird,

2294
02:30:07,420 --> 02:30:11,400
you always talk about like how you got
to see that you got to see the dark to,

2295
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:14,430
to appreciate it,
appreciate the light. Right.

2296
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:19,560
I actually just,
cause we just got done with that dark,

2297
02:30:19,561 --> 02:30:23,580
dark darkness of a book in just
having a conversation right now.

2298
02:30:23,610 --> 02:30:28,230
I'm so happy just to be like
here and talking and we're,

2299
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:33,260
we're selling some cool t shirts and
drinking just to be just in this situation

2300
02:30:35,100 --> 02:30:39,930
and know that we have this goodness
around us is, uh, is really good.

2301
02:30:39,931 --> 02:30:44,931
So I think it is worth venturing into
the dark so that you can appreciate the

2302
02:30:45,091 --> 02:30:45,924
light.

2303
02:30:45,960 --> 02:30:50,130
If you want to hear more
of this kind of things.

2304
02:30:50,370 --> 02:30:51,540
Obviously you've got the podcast,

2305
02:30:51,570 --> 02:30:56,310
you can also pick up a book written
by myself and my brother Leif Babin.

2306
02:30:56,670 --> 02:30:58,230
It's called extreme ownership.

2307
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,810
You can buy the book or
you can buy the audio book,

2308
02:31:00,811 --> 02:31:03,120
which is actually Lafe and I reading it.

2309
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:06,450
So you'll get some more
information in there.

2310
02:31:06,451 --> 02:31:10,740
And that's everything I talk about
is, is in that book. I mean that's,

2311
02:31:10,770 --> 02:31:14,220
that's the basic principles of combat
leadership that we put in there.

2312
02:31:14,690 --> 02:31:18,770
Let me add one thing about extreme
that book extreme ownership.

2313
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:24,360
It's good. It's like Dang, this is you fee
or I dunno, everyone's different but me,

2314
02:31:24,361 --> 02:31:28,410
I felt like more of an adult after
like 10 incorporating these like,

2315
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:33,810
but here's the thing that you do take
away is the people around you will notice

2316
02:31:33,840 --> 02:31:37,200
that you're a better person to be around.
And I,

2317
02:31:37,201 --> 02:31:39,240
I thought I was like pretty nice anyway,

2318
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:44,300
but you'll feel people like gravitating
towards you more because like any

2319
02:31:44,570 --> 02:31:48,060
abrasive and everyone has varying
levels of abrasiveness in them.

2320
02:31:48,061 --> 02:31:50,880
Even if it's just a teeny tiny little bit,
everyone has self.

2321
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:56,300
But what that does is it makes you work
with people in a way less abrasive way.

2322
02:31:59,820 --> 02:32:02,610
So people want to be around
you when things go. Now,

2323
02:32:03,690 --> 02:32:08,550
I would say that's, that's a very good
assessment and I'll tell you that I was,

2324
02:32:08,670 --> 02:32:11,910
felt it, especially when I was in
the, when I was in the military,

2325
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:15,930
in the seal teams, when,
when I was doing something,

2326
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:18,960
people wanted to come with
me. Yeah. It was all good.

2327
02:32:18,990 --> 02:32:20,730
We all wanted to get after it together.

2328
02:32:20,970 --> 02:32:24,480
So that's probably an
indicator of the principals

2329
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:29,080
in the book at work in my life.
Yeah. You don't have some people,

2330
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:33,670
um, I mean, I dunno, maybe
us, whatever, where, you know,

2331
02:32:33,671 --> 02:32:36,340
you'll have a small little
conflict or a little something,

2332
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:37,910
little friction with somebody's

2333
02:32:40,300 --> 02:32:43,420
conflict in Wa maybe at work
or even at home or whatever.

2334
02:32:44,110 --> 02:32:47,050
I would say it's pretty rare.
Like I'm not,

2335
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:50,470
like if there was some friction
that came up between me and anyone,

2336
02:32:50,500 --> 02:32:54,820
even my friend, my wife or something,
it would stand out so much nowadays.

2337
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:57,700
Like it would come up better person,

2338
02:32:58,140 --> 02:33:02,340
you become better person. Yeah. That,
and that's at the end. That's all.

2339
02:33:02,500 --> 02:33:06,920
But like I said, it's like if you, if you
follow it, if you, you're like, Dang, I,

2340
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:09,160
you know,
I value this and I'm going to,

2341
02:33:09,280 --> 02:33:13,360
you actually incorporate
it as time goes on.

2342
02:33:13,420 --> 02:33:18,070
That's how it is. Where if you get
friction or some adversarial situation,

2343
02:33:18,071 --> 02:33:22,810
even if it's not yours, you're like,
Dang, I see that from a mile away,

2344
02:33:23,410 --> 02:33:26,040
you know, and it sticks
out. So it's not, I mean,

2345
02:33:26,050 --> 02:33:29,830
some people it's part of their everyday
thing just for road rage or I don't know

2346
02:33:29,870 --> 02:33:33,130
any of the thing, but it's, yeah,
it's good man. It's good like that.

2347
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:34,530
Well thanks.
I appreciate it.

2348

Echos, add Echo Charles.
I am at jockowillink.

2352
02:33:53,370 --> 02:33:54,270
That's on Twitter.

2353
02:33:54,300 --> 02:33:58,350
The Facebooky and even have a little
bit to the Instagram going on.

2354
02:33:58,830 --> 02:34:01,530
If you've actually answered most of the,
well,

actually every single thing that
comes on Twitter, I will respond to.

2356
02:34:05,280 --> 02:34:06,870
I'm going to see how long
I can keep that up for,

2357
02:34:07,080 --> 02:34:10,710
I don't know how long it's gonna last.
It's getting pretty hardcore right now,

2358
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:16,940
but I'm definitely reading everything
that's coming in and we appreciate the

2359
02:34:17,171 --> 02:34:21,000
feedback we get from you guys and you guys
bring it a little light to all worlds.

2360
02:34:21,010 --> 02:34:25,330
Much appreciated.
And thanks for bringing that light to us.

2361
02:34:27,070 --> 02:34:28,090
And most of all,

2362
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:33,820
thanks for going out there
and getting after it.

2363
