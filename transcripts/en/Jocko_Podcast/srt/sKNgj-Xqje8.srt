00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,540
This is Jocko podcast number
49 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,420
Jocko Willink.
Oh,

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,010
it starts off quiet.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,913
Wait,

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,560
when you're young,

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,830
you don't quite know where it comes from
and at first you don't even know what

7
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,724
it is,

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,540
but you know it's something.

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,400
You feel it,
you feel it growing.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,390
You're just a child, but
you feel it. Something,

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,540
something inside of you.

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,790
And at some point,
that thing

13
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,910
it crosses over.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,760
It goes from being something
that you don't fully recognize.

15
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,610
Something that you don't
completely understand.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,030
It goes from that

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,450
to being you.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,380
Those things become you.

19
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,660
It is you.
Eat is your emotions.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is sadness and happiness
and passion and anger and joy,

21
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,890
and it is rage

22
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,290
and those things,
those emotions,

23
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:38,570
the burn.
