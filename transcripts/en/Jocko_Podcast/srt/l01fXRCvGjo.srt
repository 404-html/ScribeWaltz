1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,190
This is Jocko podcast number
one 32 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,130
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,903
Okay.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,070
The warriors are all dead.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,410
Okay.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,570
They lie on the more field.

7
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,720
Yeah,

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,600
they struggled but shall not enter.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,150
They went but shall not return.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,433
Okay.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,600
The planes are flat and wide.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,830
The way home,
as long

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,750
their swords lie beside them,

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,250
they're black bows in their hand.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,090
Though their limbs were torn,

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
their hearts could not be repressed.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,680
They were more than brave.

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,070
They were inspired with the spirit of woo,

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,100
steadfast to the end.
They could not be daunted.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,610
Their bodies were stricken down,

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,450
but their souls have taken a mortality

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,130
captains among the ghosts

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,920
heroes among the dead

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,280
and that is an excerpt from an ancient
Chinese poem written by Q one and there's

25
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,870
not many details of his life.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,320
He was a patriotic poet that lived
around 300 BC and the poem refers to the

27
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,470
spirit of woo,
which I like

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,410
cause woo means Marshall

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,050
as in martial arts,

30
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:14,430
as in things that are related to war
and things that are related to fighting.

31
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,190
Well that's a Wu means of war.

32
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,920
Three is talking about the spirit of war.

33
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,970
And of course China has an incredibly
rich history of art and culture and fought

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,500
for thousands of years.

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Many dynasties that I've
carried on that rich culture.

36
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,290
But we also of course know that
China has a long history of war.

37
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,240
The Knowledge About Warren,

38
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:54,241
we've already looked at one
of the fundamental books
about Warren strategy from

39
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,880
Sun Tzu,
the art of war.

40
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,900
And today we're going to take a look at
another important document that comes

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,980
from China.
It's called the 36 stratagems.

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,880
And this document has been
around for a long time

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,850
and it's actual origin is
debated where it came from.

44
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,220
There's some people that say Sun Tzu
wrote it. Actually, there's a, uh,

45
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,450
another military
strategist named Zeus Dang.

46
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,250
And some people think he wrote it,
but the current prevailing view

47
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,780
is that it's a compilation of information
that was compiled by different people,

48
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,980
different authors over the year,
over the years.

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,850
And the actual version that I'm using
was compiled by a guy named Peter Taylor.

50
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,970
And if you remember, so 36 stratagems,

51
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,370
that's what it's called,
the 36 stratagems.

52
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,230
And if you remember from a
recent podcast that we did,

53
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:01,300
stratagem doesn't mean strategy.

54
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,520
It doesn't mean that it's a trick.
That's what it means. It's a subterfuge,

55
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,290
it's a, it's a sneaky
maneuver to get what you want.

56
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,220
That sort of strategy is now this
book is divided up into six sections.

57
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,670
The first three are
for when you're winning

58
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,520
and the second three are
for when you're losing.

59
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,920
The winning stratagems are advantageous,

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,260
opportunistic and attacking.

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,850
And the other like losing type strategies
when you're losing our confusion,

62
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,810
deception and desperation.

63
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,090
And you don't want some of
these we've heard before summer,

64
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,210
a new take on an old idea or an old take
that we think is a new idea in all of

65
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,104
them.

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,390
Reinforce kind of what we know and allow
us to think about these things a little

67
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:04,600
bit different way and see them from
a different angle. So here we go.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,950
The 36 stratagems

69
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,460
number one sneak across the
ocean in broad day light.

70
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,530
And so after they give that,
that's the actual, that's the,

71
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:21,790
that's the stratagem right there.

72
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,520
And so you've got to give a little
explanation around some of them.

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,840
And Peter Taylor does it in this book.
He,

74
00:05:26,841 --> 00:05:29,650
he lines them out and I've
actually seen there's a,

75
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,270
there's another copy of this same book
where they all have the sort of general

76
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,310
uh,
explanation.

77
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,670
A lot of them have the same general
explanation own almost as if it's part of

78
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:43,030
the same book,
but to hit that part.

79
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:46,450
So it says number one sneaker
across the ocean in broad day light.

80
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,310
What does that mean?
What you often,

81
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,880
what you see often you do not doubt and
what is familiar becomes uninteresting

82
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,920
and a perfect cloak for
the unusual and unexpected.

83
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,620
This strategy means that you can mask
your real purpose by using the ruse or a

84
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,250
fake target that everyone
takes for granted. Tactically,

85
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,580
this is known as the open
faint in front of everyone.

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:14,960
You Point West when your goal is
actually in the east. For example,

87
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:18,950
a goalkeeper when facing a penalty shot
will often stand to one side or the

88
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,784
other,

89
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,270
effectively inviting the opposing player
to aim towards the open space when in

90
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:26,720
fact the goalkeeper reacts
and moves to this exact space,

91
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,180
the moment when the shot is taken.
Thus saving the goal.

92
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,193
No,

93
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,503
pretty clear.

94
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,760
Next one to besiege way to rescue Zau

95
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,710
besiege way to rescues out when the enemy
is too strong to be attacked directly

96
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,610
than attack something they hold
close to them or value dearly.

97
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,670
So this is a little bit different
than just a flank, right?

98
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,920
A flank means I'm going to
hit your weak point. This is,

99
00:06:55,921 --> 00:06:57,900
I'm going to attack something
that you care about.

100
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,550
Take the indirect approach
and find their Achilles heel.

101
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:04,140
So that is the weak point.
But the first,

102
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,000
the first explanation is
not just the weak point,

103
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,590
it's I'm going to attack something
that you are, you care about.

104
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,250
Thinking about how do,

105
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,090
how you do this in a relationship like
a well in a business relationship or

106
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:19,770
something and insults. Oh yeah.
There you go. All kinds of things.

107
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,290
Back to the book of the origin of this
proverb is apparently from the Warring

108
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,290
States period when the state of way
attacked Zau and laid siege to its capital

109
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,190
hand,
Dom Zau term to key for help.

110
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,880
But the key general son been determined.

111
00:07:38,881 --> 00:07:41,790
It would be unwise to meet
the army of way head on.

112
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:46,650
So instead he attacked their
capital on hearing the news,

113
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,840
the army of way retreated in haste and
the tired troops were then ambushed and

114
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:52,674
defeated.

115
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,790
The idea here is to avoid a head on
battle with a strong enemy and instead

116
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:59,400
striking his weakness elsewhere so
that that part we've heard before.

117
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:00,234
We know that part,

118
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,160
but I liked the idea of attacking
something that they care about more.

119
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,200
I mean that's a classic. That's
a classic like classic is, Oh,

120
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:14,460
I can't get to you but I'm going to get to
your kids. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll,

121
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,590
I'll kill your kids. That's
always the worst. Right.

122
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,150
And you know all your movies that you
watched. Yeah, they always do that.

123
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,950
What? So that as far as comparing
it to a flank flank is like,

124
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,380
I mean comparatively speaking,
what just,

125
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,990
I mean obviously to go
to the side of the side,

126
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,320
is this somewhere the metal shielded
or bunk, right bunker, right number.

127
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,570
Yeah.
Number three,

128
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:44,690
kill with a borrowed knife attack using
the strength of another in a situation

129
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,800
where using one's own strength is not
favorable trick and ally into attacking

130
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:53,790
him or bribe an official to turn trader
in your favor or use the enemy's own

131
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,690
strength against him.

132
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,370
Borrowing a knife to kill
may seem rather to devious,

133
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:03,660
but fundamentally it's making use of
others' resources for your own gain and

134
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:06,000
sometimes without your
opponent's knowing it.

135
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,950
There's some underhanded
stuff with this for sure.

136
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:14,290
The idea here is it caused damage to your
enemy by letting a third party bricked

137
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,250
by getting a third party to do the deed.
In fact,

138
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:22,050
it can be said that your enemy's enemy
is your front, which we've heard before.

139
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,310
Kill with a borrowed knife.
That's a good one. The,

140
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,090
I keep thinking about when I read these,

141
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,390
I think about people interacting with
other people and how someone will get

142
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:39,170
someone all spun up like, Oh,
can you believe echo did this?

143
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,510
You shouldn't say something about that.
You're right and like, like do that way

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,040
number four wait to at leisure
while the enemy labors,

145
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,270
it is an advantage to choose the time
and place for battle in this way.

146
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,940
You will know when and where
the battle will take place.

147
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,230
While your enemy does not encourage your
enemy to expend his energy in feudal

148
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:05,640
quests to while you conserve
your strength, when he is
exhausted and confused,

149
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,650
you attack with energy and purpose.

150
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,260
What part of Jujitsu did you
not understand right there?

151
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,440
So he asked me that the other day is it
isn't a tactic to let someone get tired

152
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,310
and 100% yeah. It's like one
of the foundational principles.

153
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,200
Yeah. I mean if you look at the
early UFC, if you look at hoists,

154
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:32,280
Gracie in the early UFC,
that was,

155
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,910
I would say he used that term, that
tactic a majority of the time. Yeah.

156
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:39,600
That's like what essentially did you
through is like when they started it like

157
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,360
caleal grief. He was a little guy,
whatever, and that's the, yeah,

158
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:42,931
that's what he would say.

159
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:45,900
The whole time you cook up and they
call it cooking and look at all,

160
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,950
it's part of the deal. No cookie
dough. That's good. I like that.

161
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:53,430
I haven't heard that one in a while.
Number five,

162
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,680
loot a burning house.

163
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,850
When a country is beset by
internal conflicts or when
disease and famine ravages

164
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:04,530
the population or when
corruption and crime are rampant,

165
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,260
then it will be unable to
deal with an outside threat.

166
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,770
This then is the best time to attack.
These are devious,

167
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,800
aren't that when you read
them, they're devious. Amen.

168
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,390
Marshall with the Marshall Way. Yeah.
You know what? I've seen some companies,

169
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,580
some businesses that do that right
there and they do it well. Yeah.

170
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,640
When they're really,
when they're really hostile,

171
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,090
they sew the seeds of all that,
all the chaos,

172
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,780
all the ravages and all the famines
and all the corruption and crime.

173
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,060
When a company's really devious,

174
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,320
they sow those seeds with the other
company and then they watch them fall part

175
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,480
of them. Then they go in
and take them down. Yeah.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Luda burning house means taking personal
gain from bad situations that your

177
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:54,190
enemies are facing. While a house is
ablaze or during major disturbance,

178
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,540
there'll be enough confusion to make
it easy and accessible to steal or take

179
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,290
advantage of the situation.
When your enemy is in a
state of confusion and chaos,

180
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,110
it prevents the perfect
opportunity to wipe them out.

181
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,870
Number six, make a sound in the
east then strike in the West.

182
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,333
In any battle,

183
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,290
the element of surprise can provide an
overwhelming advantage even when face to

184
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:21,400
face with an enemy.

185
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,360
Surprise can still be employed by
attacking where he least expects it.

186
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,710
The idea here is to get the enemy to
focus on his on one location and then

187
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:32,530
attack a weekly defendant spot in boxing.

188
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,180
Fainting is a body movement
or an incomplete attack
used primarily to create a

189
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,620
certain reaction from the opponent.

190
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:44,220
The idea is to create an opening or draw
the opening into responding or draw the

191
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:48,310
opponent into responding so that you may
anticipate and counter with a prepared

192
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:51,280
attack.
In order for faints to be successful,

193
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,350
they must make the opponent believe
that a punch is a real thing coming.

194
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,360
So we've talked about that before.
You can't,

195
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,250
you can't do the weak attempt
at a submission as well.

196
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:06,820
With Andy, last night we've been having,

197
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:12,420
we've been having some wars
lately and last night he,

198
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,220
and it's funny and this is,
there's a whole,

199
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,860
there's a whole thing going on because

200
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,890
psychologically,
right,

201
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,100
if there's a timer on paying attention
to it psychologically and like I know how

202
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:30,730
much time I can survive
in certain situations,

203
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:33,430
so I might take a risk that
I know, hey, if I end up,

204
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,500
I'll take this risk right now there's,
there's,

205
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,700
there's a minute and 18 seconds left.
I'm going to take a risk.

206
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,310
The risk is going to take me 18 seconds.
If I make it great,

207
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,610
if I, if, if the risk pays off great,
we're going to be in a good spot.

208
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,720
If the risk doesn't pay off,
well then I've got,

209
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,570
it's going to take him 10 seconds to get.
Now I've got 50 seconds.

210
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,950
I know how long it's going to take.

211
00:13:56,951 --> 00:13:59,350
The set some things at the time it was
good to go. You're going to be okay.

212
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,280
Last night it was close, close, close.

213
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:10,120
I'd play the game of risk. Took a risk.
They didn't pay, you know, going off.

214
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,780
Yeah we were going, they took
the risk, didn't pay off,

215
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,130
ended up in a bad situation and,

216
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,810
and he was straightening out my arm
and,

217
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,210
and I got out of the arm lock and he
slapped a triangle on me and I'm hard to

218
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:32,380
triangle too cause I'm just like large.
Right? He slapped a triangle on me.

219
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,990
If you do get the triangle on me, it's
going to be pretty deep. Now it's,

220
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,480
and I was like, it was literally
that was thinking of myself. He's,

221
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,050
he doesn't have time to finish this.
He does not even like,

222
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't even have to defend this right
now because he doesn't have time to

223
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:49,540
finish it. So he slapped it on there. I
didn't even defend. And then I was like,

224
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,433
oh no,

225
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,940
this thing is tight, tight,
and then the bell rang.

226
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,730
I laughed because it's not,
it happens all the time. Yeah.

227
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,490
That timer thing is like,
that's a real thing.

228
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,560
You can almost physically feel the time,
but here's,

229
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,910
here's the thing is if there's no timer,
if we don't have a clock running,

230
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,260
my game is different yet I won't
take that risk. I'll super patient.

231
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,060
Super. You know, sarge
used to joke about it.

232
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:17,871
Sergeant be like,
oh,

233
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:21,860
Jocko was going to hang onto your arm and
work that arm with not moving for like

234
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,580
seven minutes. He's going to say he's
hanging out. This is all good with me.

235
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,670
I'm over here just, I'm just,
I'm just cruising. I got your,

236
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm not letting go of it. That's not
happening. I'm going to sit here.

237
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,850
I didn't know that. You have a little
bit, you're using some strength.

238
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,420
You're using a little bit
to just maintain. Yup. I'm
going to let that happen.

239
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,170
I'm going to let you cook. I'm going
to cook me a little bit, but you see,

240
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,050
you could cook stuff in five
minutes. Right? You know,

241
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,980
it's hard to cook something
in five minutes. It's true.
Well yeah, that is true.

242
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:52,220
Generally speaking, that tie
like, you know, it's a different,

243
00:15:52,221 --> 00:15:52,971
the difference between,

244
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:57,610
you know how like some roles you'll go
against the wall or something, you know,

245
00:15:57,611 --> 00:16:00,710
you just, and you go against a wall
and then sometimes you're like, hey,

246
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:03,860
we're by the wall in the corner or
whatever. So let's go to the middle.

247
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:06,950
Or sometimes you know, depending on
who your role with what the tempo,

248
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:10,010
what the mood is. He just
no walls fair. All good.

249
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,440
So that's what the timer kind of is to,
you know, or that's what it feels like.

250
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,430
You can almost feel it where it's like,
okay, the tenant, when the time goes off,

251
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,780
the time is game. This is all part of
the game now. But if there's no time,

252
00:16:23,781 --> 00:16:25,600
it's kind of like, it doesn't
have that. So you kind of have,

253
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,270
I have more fun role and with Andy
when we do, when we have the timer,

254
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,360
because that means every three minutes
I'm taking a risk and I'm trying to make

255
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:38,780
something happen. Or, or if he's in a
dominant position, which he, you know,

256
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:41,630
he gets him really dominant positions
and he's really good at maintaining them

257
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:45,290
and he tries to get it done in that time.

258
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,940
Otherwise he'd be cooking me for a longer
time, I guess. Which would not be fun.

259
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,260
No. So I should say that could
be all right. Next section.

260
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,650
Stratagems for opportunistic situations,

261
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,290
create something from nothing.

262
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,130
Make somebody believe there was something
when there was in fact nothing or

263
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:08,030
simply put lie.

264
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,740
One method of using this strategy,

265
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,140
Mr. Creating an illusion
of something's existence,

266
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:16,610
when in fact it does not exist.

267
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:19,460
Another is to create an illusion that
something does not exist when it in fact

268
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,430
us pretty obvious. You know, it's
a good thing to think about it.

269
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,431
Like even if you're of the attitude
that you don't want to lie,

270
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,850
it's good to know these stratagems that
other people can use them on you. Yeah,

271
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,610
fully. And the lie, I mean that seems
like a conceptual life. Like, you know,

272
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,190
you know the guy who gets
fired up and puts the,

273
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,010
puts on this huge display isn't
that sort of ally, you know,

274
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,860
ferocious and crazy.

275
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,980
And then it's kind of usually
just to cover up something
else. Yeah, that's true.

276
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,860
Or if you get, like, if you're going
to spend just a moment in time,

277
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,190
Sam Harrison,

278
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,980
Jordan Peterson just dropped in here and
started having a discussion about what

279
00:17:58,981 --> 00:17:59,970
was the line,
what was,

280
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,840
I'm sure that would just take this
whole thing to a different place.

281
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:06,870
Well,

282
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,750
I'm sure the first thing they would do
is determine what is considered a lie.

283
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,410
Conceptually, it's like any, any
deception really. Yeah, yeah, that's true.

284
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,900
So like look, if me and
you are in a, I dunno,

285
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,610
MMA fight or something and my
ankle is straight up sprained,

286
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,490
I'm not going to show it.
You know,

287
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,970
like my natural inclination
is to limp on that thing.

288
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,700
But I'm going to go out of my way
to just show that I'm not, you know,

289
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:36,060
it's no factor. Is that a lot? Yeah. Yeah,

290
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,610
it is right here. Yeah. I'm
in fact injured. I met there.

291
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:44,960
I bet we're going to get people that
are like, no, I lie is technically no.

292
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,210
There's probably some technical
definition that's puts it beyond just a

293
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,010
deception. Yeah. That's my guess.

294
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,450
Intentional deception.
It's weird cause here's the deal.

295
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,120
We know what Elias.
Yeah, we know what Elias,

296
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,790
we know what it is. We know what is
the line? What is it? I Dunno man.

297
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:07,680
There's that gray area. I'm telling you
there's that gray area. Check small,

298
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,180
but yeah.
All right.

299
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,840
We will not have a discussion about that

300
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:15,271
next.

301
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:20,271
Openly repair the gallery roads but
sneak through the passage of Chin gang

302
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,213
deceive the enemy.

303
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,250
We've been obvious approach that we'll
take a very long time while surprising

304
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:28,990
and by taking a shortcut and
sneaking upon him the clock.

305
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,990
Just classic fundamental strategy.
Next,

306
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:37,680
I like this one.
Watch the fires burning across the river.

307
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,910
Delay the delay entering the field of
battle until all the players have become

308
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:47,760
exhausted,
fighting amongst themselves at that point.

309
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:51,820
Go in at full strength and
pick up the pieces. When was,

310
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,770
this is exactly remember that the person
that just asked on the last podcast

311
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:58,710
about how to stop getting interrupted.

312
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,820
This is what we're talking about dude,

313
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,930
that right there and let other people
like to have their conversation and fire

314
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:07,440
their ammunition and then when they're
done fighting amongst themselves and

315
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:10,260
they're exhausted going at full
strength and pick up the pieces.

316
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,640
When a serious conflict breaks
out within the enemy alliance,

317
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,110
all you have to do is be patient and
wait quietly for the chaos to build up

318
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,850
because of once this internal conflict
intensifies than self destruction will be

319
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:26,490
the outcome besides the patient,

320
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,070
besides being patient,

321
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,250
make preparations for any advantage
that might come out of the chaos.

322
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,030
So sometimes you just got to sit across
the river and watch the fires burn for a

323
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:38,580
little while. And it's interesting
because that's exactly what that is

324
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:44,760
cause you're compelled to
interrupt back then all this stuff.

325
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,790
But it's good to sit back and
remember that the fires burn light,

326
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,000
the fires burn number 10

327
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,253
yeah,

328
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:56,780
hide a knife behind a smile

329
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,450
charm and ingratiate
yourself with your enemy.

330
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,480
And then when you have gained his trust
to move against him and secrets sons,

331
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,860
who's it most often quoted advice,

332
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:12,620
was to keep your friends
close and your enemies closer.

333
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,640
But here the stratagem
is far more duplicitous.

334
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,240
Okay.

335
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,240
In that it advises that the sole purpose
of keeping your enemy close is not just

336
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:29,150
to understand them and be prepared
for any aggression from them,

337
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:34,330
but is to deceive them with a treasonable
act that would see their downfall,

338
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,740
hide behind a knife for the smart.

339
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,770
So I was having a conversation with a
guy the other day and the question is,

340
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,790
if you've run something up the chain
of command to the absolute top,

341
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,180
you can't bring it up anymore.
And actually this was a person

342
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,540
in the fire services. If you've
brought something so far, departments,

343
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,130
if you brought something up the chain
of command to the absolute top and you

344
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:05,150
still haven't gotten what you wanted,
what would you do?

345
00:22:05,151 --> 00:22:06,800
Then they were asking me and I was like,
well,

346
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:09,440
there's some a lot of things you
could do that in that situation,

347
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,390
you know you've got less because the,
the,

348
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:15,590
the topic was basically if
training should be harder, right?

349
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,680
If people aren't training harder and I'm
bringing it up the chain of command and

350
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,570
people say, no, it's fine.
No, it's fine. No, it's fine,

351
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,550
and you believe that the strong,

352
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,730
that people should be training hard
so we're more prepared to do our job.

353
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,220
What would you do? Then Jocko, and I was
like, well, you know, you, while you cook,

354
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,560
you know what you could do. You could
say, okay, you know what you don't want.

355
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,160
Listen to me. Fine. I'm going public.

356
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:40,940
I'm going to write an article in the
newspaper about how our department is not

357
00:22:40,941 --> 00:22:44,660
prepared to handle emergencies.
That's what I'm going to do. Okay?

358
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,700
And then they're going to listen.

359
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,650
Okay,

360
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,920
now let's think about that. Let's
think about that outcome, right?

361
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:55,550
The outcome is there's a
decent chance you get fired.

362
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,420
You definitely aren't getting promoted,
you.

363
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,520
And so whether you get fired
or you don't get promoted,

364
00:23:01,521 --> 00:23:04,280
you get stuck in this position where
you have no influence on. By the way,

365
00:23:04,281 --> 00:23:07,040
did you get any check training change,
know now could there,

366
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:12,041
is there a possibility that
the public takes note and goes,

367
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,090
Oh wow,
this is wrong and we're going to,

368
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,870
we're going to have another election and
we're going to replace this fire chief

369
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:20,330
or whatever. Is there a chance that
could happen? There's a chance,

370
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,110
how'd that fire chief end up in
that position? He's a political guy.

371
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,810
He knows how to make things happen.
He knows how to take care of himself.

372
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,600
And if you think he's gonna let some
little article out in the newspaper,

373
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,930
get him deposed from his position,
you're wrong.

374
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,160
You're under Matt estimating your,
your enemy at this point. Yeah,

375
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,820
so don't do that. So I said,
what if instead of doing that,

376
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:47,060
you wrote let's say same idea you a
positive article about the fire department

377
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:50,270
and it made everyone look good and
the chief looked at you like you were

378
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:52,580
spreading the good word. And he
says, oh, well, you know what?

379
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,980
I appreciate you putting up that article.
That was really good.

380
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:58,730
It made us look good. He mastered that
part music. I liked your article. Well,

381
00:23:58,731 --> 00:23:59,151
you know,
chief,

382
00:23:59,151 --> 00:24:01,940
I just want to let people know what
we're doing over here and now you're

383
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:06,080
building trust. You're building trust with
him and now he says, Oh, you know what?

384
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,720
Yeah, you, you know what? You
should run this thing over here.

385
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,820
Once you run that little thing and you
take that thing and you run it and you

386
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:13,910
keep it in the box that you know he
would like it in and then he goes, hey,

387
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,930
you know you did a good job with that.

388
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,190
I'm going to get you
up a little bit higher.

389
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,080
And eventually you get to a position of
influence where you actually can make

390
00:24:21,081 --> 00:24:23,930
the change that you want to make.
Now again,

391
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,110
the thing is when I say things like this,
people are always,

392
00:24:27,111 --> 00:24:31,070
they don't want to hear it.
Like when, when when someone,

393
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,530
they think they know me and
they're like, oh, you know what?

394
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:37,730
And I was saying this the other day at
a different company that everybody wants

395
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:39,920
me to say, you know what you're going
to do when a situation like that,

396
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,090
you come in with a battle ax and you
start swinging and you take out everyone

397
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:45,590
that's in your way.
That's how you win,

398
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,410
and I wished that that was true, but
it's actually not true. It's not true.

399
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,450
You don't win. You don't win when
you do that. Yeah. You have to think.

400
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,370
You have to play the game. What you have
to do is hide a knife. Gone to smile.

401
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,240
Now that's, that's very true.
Treasonous. He calls it,

402
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,360
but if your goal, if your goal,
let's take the fire department.

403
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:13,361
If your goal is to actually do a better
job and save more people's lives because

404
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:16,580
you've trained more and that's the knife
that you're trying to get out in the

405
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,560
end. Is that a bad thing? No,
it's actually a good thing.

406
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,070
You're not hiding the knife
behind a smile. You're hiding.

407
00:25:22,071 --> 00:25:24,860
Save lives behind a smile.
That's what you're doing.

408
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:30,110
This takes tactical patients.
Yeah. Tactical patients.

409
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,860
That's a word people used to throw around
because they thought it sounded cool.

410
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,040
It does. It does. It's
a real thing though.

411
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,050
And if you don't have tactical patience
to play the, to win the long war,

412
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,200
it's a long war. Years.
They can take years.

413
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,830
This situation that they're talking to,
this fire guy the other day,

414
00:25:47,831 --> 00:25:52,460
that situation could take
years to unfold years,

415
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,120
but,
and we've talked with,

416
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:01,121
if you just make a stink and cause
problems and run up the run your mouth and

417
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:05,630
cause all this, all this focus and
bring the spotlight to the bad areas,

418
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,760
guess what?
You're not even going to get,

419
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,400
you're not going to get moved up into
putting in a better position. Yeah.

420
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,760
So don't do that. Yeah. So crazy.

421
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:18,761
That's like a lot of times the advice
you'd give is literally the exact opposite

422
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,580
of what it feels like we should do.
And it's like you feel like, Hey,

423
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,820
I need to do this. I just need
to know how can you tell me how?

424
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,430
And you don't tell how you say,
hey wait, you need to do this. No,

425
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:31,220
you don't need to do that. You need to do
the exact opposite of that. You're like,

426
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:35,090
aw man,
it's not what you think you me up.

427
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,350
But um,

428
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,860
I will say through experience that your
answers tend to be right 100% the time.

429
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,890
Yeah. People a lot of times
you don't hear anyone.

430
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,540
When I was younger I didn't want to hear
them either. Yes, that part is true. Yeah,

431
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:52,200
for sure. When when I was younger
I was like screw that guy. Yeah.

432
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:56,780
What am I do cultivate a relationship
with this, this guy? Yeah. He's,

433
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,550
we know on sat,
you know there's a,

434
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,650
there's a military term onset tried.
I used to,

435
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,180
that used to be my staff used to be.

436
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:09,210
That used to be as bad as that was the
worst adjective I could use. I'd be like,

437
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:13,050
that guy's unsat
or you know,

438
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:16,650
whatever it was to gear people like well
how's that gear unsat cause you'd get

439
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:20,490
marked like on an inspection UNSAT,
which meant on satisfactory.

440
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,930
I need to bring that back man.
It's been awhile. But yeah,

441
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:28,140
Jeremy Cake not too used to always say
that sat on set cause you could have

442
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:31,380
sense to that was if you
were to say to me like,

443
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,370
oh how was that dinner last
night? Sat meaning it was, it was,

444
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,840
it was good. It was fine. I said
that they knew was that sat unset.

445
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,590
You have to put sat and on onset kind
of together for sat to make any sense

446
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:47,280
whatsoever. Naturally check. All right,

447
00:27:47,281 --> 00:27:52,110
number 11 preserve the plum tree or sorry,

448
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,470
sacrifice the plum tree to
preserve the peach tree.

449
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,340
There are circumstances in
which you must sacrifice shirt,

450
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,420
short term objectives in order to
gain the desired longterm goal.

451
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,120
This is the scapegoat stratagem whereby
someone else suffers the consequences

452
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,260
and the so the rest do not pretty,
pretty straightforward. That one.

453
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,170
I think some of these strategies
that are straightforward,

454
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,880
what's good about hearing them is that
you recognize them because it might seem

455
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:24,930
obvious, but then you, when you're
doing it, you do it. You're like,

456
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:26,250
well I don't know. We
could and you say, oh wait,

457
00:28:26,251 --> 00:28:28,120
you know what we're actually
doing? We're, we're,

458
00:28:28,121 --> 00:28:30,690
we're sacrificing the plum
tree to spare the peach tree.

459
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:31,800
That's what we're gonna do right now.

460
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,380
Once you commit to that or
you understand it fully,

461
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:38,970
then you can execute it with
more authority. Yes. Was
she in the in the wild too?

462
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:42,150
Cause like if you have that, that
framework to stick to, you know like,

463
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,790
oh this is what we're going to do kind
of thing and all these other variables

464
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:48,720
happen on equity, you know, unplanned
stuff. But you have that to stick to it.

465
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,910
It makes it way more clear
to the commander's intent.

466
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,410
The commander's intent
is very clear and so on.

467
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:56,310
And we know what we're going to do.
That's what's going to happen. Number 12

468
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:57,750
okay.

469
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,570
Take the opportunity to pill for a goat,

470
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,800
a while carrying out your plans.

471
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,310
You need to be flexible enough to
take advantage of any opportunity that

472
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:12,600
presents itself however small
and avail yourself of any profit,

473
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:15,720
however slight. That's a
good one. I think it's,

474
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,580
I think it's important
to keep in mind though,

475
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,670
that you don't want to get
pulled off track, right?

476
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,300
You want to keep focused on your mission
and all of a sudden you can be running

477
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:27,060
around gathering up goats
while your real target escapes.

478
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,830
So let's not get too crazy with that
one. But again, let's keep it in mind.

479
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,860
Next section.
Strategy for attacking situations.

480
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,700
Number 13

481
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,460
stomp the grass to scare the snake.

482
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,740
Do something unnamed but spectacular to
provoke a response of the enemy there by

483
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:55,090
giving away his plans or position or
just taunt him. Do something unusual,

484
00:29:55,091 --> 00:30:00,091
strange and unexpected as this will
arouse the enemy suspicion and disrupt us

485
00:30:00,311 --> 00:30:03,310
thinking.
This is recon by fire.

486
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,950
Just fire some rounds and maybe the
enemy shoots back or you're not,

487
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:10,240
and now you know where they are.
Next,

488
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:14,860
borrow a corpse to resurrect the soul.

489
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,830
Take an institution,

490
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:24,430
a method or even an ideology that
has been forgotten or discarded and

491
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:27,050
appropriate it for your own purpose.

492
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:32,860
Revive something from the past by giving
it a new purpose or bring to life old

493
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:35,301
ideas,

494
00:30:35,301 --> 00:30:40,301
customs or traditions and reinterpret
them for your to fit your purposes.

495
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,620
Here's,
here's an example is like Hitler,

496
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,380
he brought back,

497
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,700
he would bring back like old viking
symbols and route that route.

498
00:30:57,351 --> 00:30:59,240
The Viking tradition like,
hey,

499
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:04,010
you're a viking where vikings and
they have like little symbols. That's,

500
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:08,150
that's exactly what it is and just
use that so then people have a deeper

501
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:12,020
connection with with this thing.
Yeah,

502
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,693
makes sense.

503
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Next 15 entice the tiger to
leave it's mountain layer.

504
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:24,900
Never directly attack an opponent who's
advantages derived from its position.

505
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,540
Instead,
Laura him away from his position,

506
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,110
thus separating him from
his source of strength.

507
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,400
The strategy is based on the idea that
the tigers powerful only when it's in its

508
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:36,240
natural environment,

509
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,690
but if removed from that environment
becomes weaker and more vulnerable.

510
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,530
I don't know if a tiger is weak,
a not a good environment.

511
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,580
I think a tiger could still kill me
pretty quickly. Even in a city street,

512
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:50,760
maybe in the water he
couldn't. No, that's not true.

513
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:54,210
No personnel in Sri Lanka.

514
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:59,450
The Tigers would swim like
they would swim and pull fish,

515
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:03,250
get into boats and pull
fishermen to their death. Yeah.

516
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,400
How's that for a nightmare and
that's rough. That's again,

517
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,280
pretty clear. You know what? This isn't
Jujitsu. You get someone to play that,

518
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,760
not their game. Yeah. Oh, you got a good
guard. Cool. On the pole. Garland room,

519
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,000
or really well, why did you do to founded
yet again? It's you take a guy who's,

520
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:23,520
you know, what's the traditional
method of fighting? I'm a standup.

521
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,670
Throw punches and kicks. Adam.
Yeah, so Jujitsu, it's like, oh,

522
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:30,690
you take them out of the punching
and kicking situation to the ground.

523
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,680
No punches, no kicks and effective
boom. That's as you who shits. Yup.

524
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,460
You're not in your special place anymore.
This is,

525
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,960
this is an interesting one.
Number 16 in order to capture one minute,

526
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,270
let one must let loose cornered.

527
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:51,680
Pray will often mount a final
desperate attack to prevent this.

528
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,160
You let the enemy believe he
still has a chance for freedom,

529
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:59,270
his will to fight thus dampened
by his desire to escape.

530
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,490
When in the end the freedom is proven,

531
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:04,280
a false owed and the enemy's
morale will be defeated.

532
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,340
You surrender without a fight.
So we've, we've heard that one.

533
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,280
That's the golden bridge.
We just heard it from Frederick the great,

534
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,270
I think we also heard it from the Getty's.
They're saying,

535
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,690
give the people a little out. They see
that. They see that chance to escape.

536
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,210
I remember,
I think it was for Getty,

537
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,770
it's was saying did they would just leave
their weapons because they want to get

538
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:23,380
away so bad.
They just leave their weapons and,

539
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:25,550
and then you're just waiting for him.
Slaughter.

540
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,950
If an enemy has no way to retreat than
desperation will increase their bravery

541
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:32,150
and ferocity of their fight.

542
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,950
So you always offer them room for
retreat and in such a retreat there,

543
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,930
their morale will be low.
Next,

544
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,320
tossing out a brick to get a jade gem
bait someone by making him believe he

545
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:53,900
gained something or just make them react
to it and obtain something valuable

546
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:58,250
from him in return.
Pretty straight forward.

547
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,350
The real meaning is to attempt this to
tempt through the offering of something

548
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,810
useless in order to
gain something valuable.

549
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,110
It is a tactic that
utilizes baiting the enemy.

550
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,880
The point of this tack is to throw out
bait that does not seem like bait on the

551
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:16,910
other hand is important to have a keen
sense of judgment to ensure you do not

552
00:34:16,911 --> 00:34:18,620
take the enemy's bait in return.

553
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:22,730
The ability to look past the immediate
gain and see the longterm cost is a

554
00:34:22,731 --> 00:34:23,564
valuable skill.

555
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,740
So if you're in a leadership situation,

556
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,990
sometimes you hold the line,
you appear to hold the line on something,

557
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:39,000
and then you, then you let you let
it go. Right. You know, like like,

558
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,080
do you want to do something a certain way?
And I'm like, well [inaudible] I don't,

559
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,470
and it's something I don't care
about. Yeah. I hold the line.

560
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:46,370
I was going to give you a
nice victory at the end of it.

561
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:50,180
I didn't already know that, but yeah,
yeah. You feel like, oh yeah, I see.

562
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:53,540
I was right. You're happy. I made
it happen. Yeah. Make it happen.

563
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,720
I was able to convince [inaudible] to do.
I didn't care.

564
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,590
I'm not going to tell you that.
I was like, no, you know what?

565
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,820
That seems like a good design
for that t shirt that go with it.

566
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,250
Next,
defeat the enemy by capturing their chief.

567
00:35:10,251 --> 00:35:15,251
If the enemy's army is strong but it's
but is allied to the commander only by

568
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:19,010
money, superstition or threats,
then take aim at the leader.

569
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:20,900
The commander falls,

570
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:23,870
the rest of the army will disperse
or come over to your side.

571
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,900
If however they are allied to the leader
through loyalty than beware the army

572
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,650
can continue to fight on after
his death out of vengeance.

573
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,100
That one's straight

574
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,580
forward,

575
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,870
but that is something that's very
important to recognize is is what kind of

576
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:46,320
loyalty the people that
you're going against. What
kind of loyalty do they have?

577
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:48,000
I work with businesses all the time.

578
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:53,001
There's businesses that established a
massively loyal employee base and the

579
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:57,780
people are their way. They are loyal.
They're not there for the money.

580
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,600
The money is like part of it, but they're
there because they want to be there.

581
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,910
Those companies and somebody,

582
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,840
somebody comes in and starts trying to
mess with those companies. Blood bath,

583
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:11,190
it is a blood bath.
Okay.

584
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:15,000
Now that's the, now we're getting
into stratagems when you are losing,

585
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,620
so things change a little bit.
Now we're on the losing side.

586
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,330
Number one is stratagem tragic
for confused situations.

587
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,333
This is a good one.

588
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,460
Remove the firewood from under the
pot if something must be destroyed,

589
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,360
destroyed the source.

590
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,870
The strength of the fire
determines whether the water
will boil and the strength

591
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:38,550
of the fire comes from the burning wood.

592
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,120
It may not be wise to confront
the boiling water directly,

593
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,370
but by taking the wood
from under cooking pot,

594
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,740
the boiling water will soon be cool.
In other words,

595
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:48,450
do not confront your
opponents strong points,

596
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:51,180
but instead remove the source
of his strength. Yeah, that's,

597
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:55,080
I don't know that I necessarily agree
with the last part there that not

598
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,230
attacking the strong points.
I think it's huge.

599
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,060
I would say watch out for
the volatile points and you,

600
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:04,680
you don't attack the things that can
do you damage like boiling water,

601
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,090
you attack something that's a little bit
detached and you go after the source.

602
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,610
I think what he's talking
about is like they call it,

603
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,190
it's a problem solving method.
If I'm not mistaken.

604
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,240
This to this direct in the systemic, oh
yeah, for sure. Yes you are correct. Yes.

605
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,730
Yeah. Attacked at the source.
Right. You know of these problems.

606
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,930
It's like you know the plant at home,
right?

607
00:37:30,931 --> 00:37:35,040
You got a tree growing in the yard.
The leaves are turning Brown.

608
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,010
That's upon us not even fall. The
leaves turning Brown. You know what?

609
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:41,430
Paint those leaves green.
That's the worst. Yeah, exactly.

610
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,620
That's attacking the boy
and that's a direct, yeah,

611
00:37:43,621 --> 00:37:47,970
that's a direct problem solving
approach or or I always say water.

612
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:51,120
The leaves don't want her to leave.
You don't want it to leave your water,

613
00:37:51,121 --> 00:37:55,860
the roots and then over time. That's a
systemic approach. That's the one. Yeah.

614
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,580
Kind. You roll deep. Sure.

615
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,530
Next Dis.

616
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,730
Number 20 disturb the
water and catch a fish.

617
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:10,350
Create confusion and use this
confusion to further your own goals.

618
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,020
Originally it means to stir the water,

619
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,880
the sediments in order to cloud the Ver
the vision of the fish and therefore

620
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,620
catch the fish here.

621
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,710
It means to create confusion so that
the enemy does not know what is real and

622
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:26,880
what is not. A confused enemy is
more vulnerable to any attack. I was,

623
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,870
I was rolling with Taylor the
other day. Sure. And we were doing,

624
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,771
we were standing up,

625
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:35,710
you know when we are getting after it
and tailors flows you that don't know.

626
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:38,350
Taylor is a beast.
He's and he's like barely human.

627
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:43,351
He's a beast and he wrestled and he does
Jujitsu and he's just sick grappler and

628
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:47,380
fighter by the way. No one will
fight him, which really makes me mad.

629
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:50,080
He's like he will fight anyone
and no one will fight him.

630
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,270
He just keeps destroying people.

631
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,240
No one wants to fight him cause you
get nothing out of it. Cause he's not,

632
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:57,940
he doesn't, his record is new. I
think he's three and oh right now.

633
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,120
So you wouldn't, if you beat a three
no fighter, that means nothing.

634
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,990
If you lose two or three in o fighter
you that that's not good for you.

635
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,720
No one smart is going to
take a fight with him.

636
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,490
I'm probably not helping by
saying this right now. Yeah,

637
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,020
not anybody that's hearing this is like,

638
00:39:11,021 --> 00:39:12,760
okay well that's one person
I'm not going to fight.

639
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,020
My point in this was we were,

640
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,770
we were doing take downs or we had
gotten to a point where we're doing take

641
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:24,771
downs and he must've thrown 87 fakes it
me in like three seconds where I was,

642
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,400
I had no idea what was
happening cause I puff.

643
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:38,350
So he definitely disturbed the water,
caught the fish

644
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,290
that used to happen with Sarge Sarge,

645
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,740
who's an awesome restaurant
and Jujitsu and if,

646
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,280
if he hadn't been doing much
wrestling he would, he would,

647
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,460
I could read that he's going to come
because he's just got a sick blast.

648
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:57,700
Double like sergeants, blast
doubles, just sick and,

649
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,650
and he just comes in full power
and it's just hard to stop. But

650
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,360
if he hasn't been wrestling, he
really, he knows he can just,

651
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,410
he just goes into like, okay,
I'm gonna hit up last double.

652
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,670
Like I'm tired of
playing around and stuff.

653
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,700
And so he gets that look on
his face and I could read it,

654
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,630
cause I know him for 25 years and he'd
get the blast, double look on his face.

655
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,980
I remember one time,
you know,

656
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:24,520
I must've sprawled on him like
two or three times in a day. And,

657
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,340
and it was,
it was kind of,

658
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,190
I could see he was a little bit
surprised that he wasn't dead.

659
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:34,420
He didn't take me down. And
I was like, yeah. So I told
him, I said, hey, you know,

660
00:40:34,421 --> 00:40:37,360
when you haven't wrestled for awhile,
you don't set it up, you just do it.

661
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,020
And then we wrestled again
and he'd set up again,

662
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,990
just 47 little touches my
face to pull my arbitrary,

663
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,370
donate to this here pushed me there,
drag this good slap here, boom.

664
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:51,670
And all of a sudden here comes the blast
off of which I didn't know was coming.

665
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,980
That makes a big difference.
Yeah. Get them waters blurred up.

666
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:00,490
Yup.
Alright.

667
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,583
Hmm.

668
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,670
Sluff off the CICADAS.
Golden Shell.

669
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,290
Cicadas like a cricket or
like a grasshopper. Mm.

670
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,840
This stratagem is mainly used to
escape from an enemy of superior force.

671
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,710
Mask yourself by either leaving
you're flamboyant traits behind,

672
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:29,450
thus going incognito or just masquerade
yourself and create an illusion to fit

673
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:33,080
your goals of distract others.
So the grasshoppers,

674
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:36,490
crickets at some point in their,
what's it called, the lifecycle,

675
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,400
like spam lifecycle. Sure.
Yeah. They, they basically,
their skin, whatever it is,

676
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,040
they're shell. Yeah. They have
to, they get rid of it. They molt.

677
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,300
Yeah. They get rid of it.
Yeah. Well you can do that too.

678
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:54,200
Yeah. You can leave some stuff behind them
if people think that's still going on,

679
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:59,120
but really you're escaping. Yeah. When
a cricket has grown to a certain stage,

680
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:03,200
it's sheds its outer shell and leaves the
empty shell behind this empty shell is

681
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:07,340
often mistaken for our wheel cricket.
Yeah. It's kind of like on total recall,

682
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,770
remember total recall the movie Arnold
Schwarzenegger? I don't remember what,

683
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,960
I don't fully remember it.
Yeah. So, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

684
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:19,880
He comes in as that woman? Yeah. Well,
yes. Okay. Oh yeah, there's that part too.

685
00:42:19,881 --> 00:42:23,420
Yeah, they the lady. Yeah, two
weeks. Right. Then it malfunctions,

686
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,290
throws the head and it's an explosion.
I was thinking more like the Hologram.

687
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,640
They always, they had this hologram
thing where it's like, oh, you know,

688
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,310
it's him, but it's just the
Hologram. Meanwhile, he's,

689
00:42:34,311 --> 00:42:38,030
I think escaping for something like this.
I went and saw when I was in college,

690
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:41,210
I had to go see a Shakespeare play,
which was cool. I'm down with that.

691
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,760
I would bring my Shakespeare
book to the place.

692
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:48,761
I had my notes when I was there and it
was funny because after the play was

693
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:55,760
over, they went, they like
brought out the cast and was,

694
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:56,720
you know,

695
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,720
kind of introducing them with some details
about their career and the woman that

696
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:03,350
played that woman,

697
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,190
that head came apart and Arnold
Schwarzenegger was inside her.

698
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,700
She was in the Shakespeare play and
here she was just getting off stage from

699
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:19,180
crushing some Shakespeare and I think it
was Richard the third and the highlight

700
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,450
that they pointed out of her whole career.

701
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:29,170
It was that she was like the woman in the
Arnold Schwarzenegger movie whose head

702
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:33,890
came apart and total recall. That was
actually, and then then it was in,

703
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:38,330
in the pamphlet that they give
you when you go to the play.

704
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,610
It was telling this guy
did this and this guy was,

705
00:43:40,611 --> 00:43:43,130
it has been in this and this guy
was in the royal listen, you know,

706
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,250
and then it's got her and it says
she played the woman in total recall.

707
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,020
Yeah, but here's the thing
about that, like on paper,

708
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,710
literally on paper that
doesn't, that sounds like, oh,
this little thing, but bro,

709
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:58,010
that was a huge part of the
movie. Let's face it, two weeks,

710
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:01,490
how long are you going to be on Mars?
Two weeks. And it's like, whatever.

711
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,970
Do you have any vegetables or something
like that. And then she goes two weeks.

712
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:09,000
Oh Dang. Thing starts malfunctioning.
Boom, boom. They identify them.

713
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:14,100
Emmett's big part of the movie. Bigger
than Shakespeare. Arguably. Yeah, no.

714
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:20,060
All right. This is one is a little bit
of a contradiction. Listen to this one.

715
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:23,960
Number 20 to shut the door to catch
the thief, to capture the enemy.

716
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,820
You must plan prudently
if you want to succeed,

717
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:29,990
do not rush into action before you move
in for the kill first caught off your

718
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:34,890
enemy's escape routes and caught off any
routes through which outside help can

719
00:44:34,891 --> 00:44:35,251
reach them.

720
00:44:35,251 --> 00:44:40,251
So that is the opposite
of having a golden bridge,

721
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:43,460
having an escape route that your people
can get out of. So you've got to,

722
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,370
if you've got a note, does that
mean now they're both in valid? No,

723
00:44:47,371 --> 00:44:51,090
actually to me it means they're both
valid. But you need to recognize,

724
00:44:51,091 --> 00:44:52,470
because for instance,

725
00:44:52,471 --> 00:44:55,320
let's say you're in a situation where you
surround the enemy and all of a sudden

726
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:57,290
they start fighting really
hard cause you're like, Hey,

727
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,460
I'm going to fall 22 I'm going to,
I'm going to surround,

728
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:00,930
everyone are going to
keep them locked in there.

729
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,170
You do that and they start fighting really
hard and you're losing a lot of guys

730
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,840
that you know, hey, open up a
little spot for him to escape. Yeah.

731
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,770
And let him run away and we'll be
waiting for him over here. Yeah.

732
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,890
So just because things
are opposites do not,

733
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,500
does not mean they negate each other.
Yeah. It's one of those deals where,

734
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,600
you know, it's circumstantial, right?
Like in Jujitsu it's like, Oh yeah,

735
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,280
does this scenario, you know,
going against this guy, does this,

736
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,180
uh,

737
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,180
should I use strength and power
and should I hustle a lot?

738
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,730
We'll that strategy work with
this guy or is it like, okay,

739
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,150
I should play more passive or
something like that. No, that's true.

740
00:45:39,151 --> 00:45:43,620
And actually to get even more
tactical and Jujitsu, you could,

741
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,670
you could,

742
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,230
let's say you mount someone
and they started just getting
crazy cause they don't

743
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:52,350
want to take a good getting completely
nuts and you're trying to choke him,

744
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:55,260
try to choke because you've got every day
and they're getting nuts and you can't

745
00:45:55,261 --> 00:45:59,130
do it if you open a little spot for them
where they think they can sneak out.

746
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,520
But you're waiting for him there with
the arm lock. Yeah. Yeah. Get the W.

747
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:08,790
Yeah, actually, yeah. That is really
how it kind of works. Where, yeah,

748
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:10,380
when you get mountain you
want to hold position.

749
00:46:10,381 --> 00:46:13,830
I mean as far as traditional to do
through, for lack of better term,

750
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:18,030
you get mount, you want to
hold the position right?
Don't want to lose position.

751
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:22,110
You can get flipped over, but if you can
hold them out, good. But if he's big,

752
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,680
strong, the starts, you know that
last desperation attempt, boom,

753
00:46:25,681 --> 00:46:28,470
you got to kind of let them
hopefully turns over. Really,

754
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:31,270
that's usually what they do. If they don't
have the experience and then boom, you,

755
00:46:31,271 --> 00:46:35,300
you, so you essentially give
up the mountain, but, but
you get it. Even he was like,

756
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,500
if you talk about a big strong guy,
that's your more experienced,

757
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:42,620
even just you could prevent them
from pushing you up in a way,

758
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:43,080
right?

759
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:47,040
You could block that door down when
there's no escape or you could let them do

760
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,880
it a little bit. You can have that little
thing and then boom. Yeah, arm locked.

761
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:54,600
Just whatever's better for the
peds situation. Sure. Next,

762
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,170
befriend a distant state
while attacking a neighbor.

763
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,580
It is known that nations that border
each other become enemies while nation

764
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:06,870
separated by distance.
Next number 23 be friend,

765
00:47:06,871 --> 00:47:09,750
a distant state.
While attacking a neighbor,

766
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,560
it is known that nations that
border each other become enemies.

767
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:18,120
While nation separated by distance
and obstacles make better allies.

768
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,900
When you are the strongest in one field,

769
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:26,220
your greatest threat is from the
second strongest in your field,

770
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:29,040
not the strongest from another field.

771
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,450
That's a, that's a good
thing to think about. Hmm.

772
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,220
That's a good thing to think about.

773
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,660
When you were the strongest in one field,

774
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:45,650
your greatest threat threat is from the
straw second strongest in your field.

775
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,610
That makes sense. See that business
all the time, right? The, the, the,

776
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,440
the company that makes pizzas isn't
worried about the company that makes cars.

777
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,700
Yeah, that's true. Right?
They're more about the other
companies that make pizzas.

778
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,730
Nope.
Next 24

779
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:04,540
okay.

780
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:08,980
Obtain safe passage to
conquer the state of Gill.

781
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:12,920
Gail is a state.

782
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:18,080
Borrow the resources of an
ally to attack a common enemy.

783
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,630
Once the enemy is defeated,

784
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,760
use those resources to turn on the allied
that lent you them in the first place.

785
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,090
That's under handed situation right there.

786
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,820
It's underhanded situation right
there, isn't it? Yeah, it's bad. Yeah.

787
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,700
Careful with that one.
But you can see it now.

788
00:48:37,701 --> 00:48:41,330
It's something you gotta watch out for.
Well, if that's your enemy to begin with,

789
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,860
I'm assuming, yeah, that fits
your enemies to begin with,

790
00:48:45,861 --> 00:48:48,110
but if how much of your
enemy is going to help you,

791
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,650
they help you and then you
just turn this down the track.

792
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,700
Got To be careful of that. I think that's
the definition of backstabbing. Yeah.

793
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:58,063
Okay.

794
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,290
Yeah, that might be the day. That is the
actual definition. All right. Next one.

795
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,760
Stratagems for deception situations.

796
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,250
Number 25 replaced the
beams with rotten timbers.

797
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,470
Disrupt the enemies formations, interfere
with their methods of operations,

798
00:49:18,471 --> 00:49:22,760
changed the rules which they are used
to following and go contrary to their

799
00:49:22,761 --> 00:49:27,410
standard training. That's all
really good stuff. In this way,

800
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:29,270
you remove the supporting pillar,

801
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,690
the common link that makes a group
of men and effective fighting force.

802
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:34,910
This goes back to what you just said.
I mean,

803
00:49:34,911 --> 00:49:39,770
it's clearly go away from what they're
used to, right? That's what we do.

804
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:43,430
That's what Jujitsu was supposed to
be. Everyone's going to, like you said,

805
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,560
they're going to stand and try and
punch you. We're not going to do that.

806
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,700
We want to take them down to the ground.

807
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:53,050
Next 26 point at the mulberry tree while
cursing the locust tree to discipline,

808
00:49:57,831 --> 00:50:00,230
control or warn others who status,

809
00:50:00,231 --> 00:50:05,231
position or status or position excludes
them from direct conversation or

810
00:50:05,481 --> 00:50:09,410
confrontation.
Use analogy and Innuendo.

811
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:13,400
When names are not used directly,

812
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,950
those accused cannot retaliate without
revealing their complicity. Oh,

813
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,740
well that's sneaky.
You know,

814
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:25,310
that's like when you're in the meeting
and there's the person up the chain of

815
00:50:25,311 --> 00:50:28,820
command they haven't been showing up
on and you start saying, you know,

816
00:50:28,821 --> 00:50:29,654
we got people,

817
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:33,170
you'll bill hasn't been on time and
you're really talking about them.

818
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,790
I have to use this sometimes

819
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:40,760
have to use it sometime because we will
work with companies and the company,

820
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,120
let's say, let's say the CEO
brings us into the company.

821
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,870
Sometimes we figured out that the CEO is
the one that's the root of the problem

822
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,770
and one of the reasons that they're,

823
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,260
the root of the problem is because they
don't think they need to change anything.

824
00:50:55,250 --> 00:51:00,170
And so they bring us in to change
everyone else. Guess who needs change?

825
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,170
The big man,
the big man,

826
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,560
the reason that they don't want to
change is because they got the ego that

827
00:51:06,561 --> 00:51:07,760
prevents them from listening.

828
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:13,810
So to go in and directly confront them
on what they need to change is not going

829
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:18,590
to be effective. So to go
in and give, I've given,

830
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,360
I've given a whole presentation,

831
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:23,780
I did this one time where I gave a whole
presentation and maybe I've done it

832
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,940
more times, but there's one time
that I specifically remember,

833
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:30,300
I gave a whole presentation to,
you know,

834
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,950
the 15 people, the senior
executive leadership of a company.

835
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,090
The entire presentation was
directed at one person, the CEO,

836
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,230
and I was going, it was about
ego. It was about, you know,

837
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,840
keeping that in check and how you don't
know everything and how you got to let

838
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:46,310
your listen to your subordinates
and all those things.

839
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:47,360
He wasn't doing any of those things.

840
00:51:48,590 --> 00:51:52,700
So isn't there like a basic tactic that
I think people do all the time instead

841
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:56,810
of, you know, like I'm the boss and I'm
holding the company meeting and whatever.

842
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,010
And, and you know, let's say there's one
guy who always shows up late to work,

843
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:05,340
I dunno. And in the meeting
he'll be like, hey guys, we've,

844
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,370
we've got to show up on time.
It's very important,

845
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:11,570
but just the very use of the word
wheat rather than pointing at one guy,

846
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,880
you know, we got to show up
at the time we got to do this.

847
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:17,270
It's kind of like the person
who is who he's talking about,

848
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:20,360
Kinda like he feels it. Yeah.
That's a good way to start.

849
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,210
There's some people that even
when they're not part of that we,

850
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:28,670
and so sometimes you have to
escalate that to you. Yeah.

851
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:33,220
But that defeats the purpose of that.
And it's defeated. You can, if you,

852
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,370
if the strategy doesn't work,

853
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,380
you might have to escalate into something
a little bit more direct, you know,

854
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,330
break out the battleax.
Yeah.

855
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:42,380
That's always the last option is just
to make sure everyone wants to break out

856
00:52:42,381 --> 00:52:45,980
the battle ax. That's what
everybody wants to do next.

857
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:49,250
27 feign madness.

858
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:53,720
But keep your balance,
hide behind the mask of a fool,

859
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,610
a drunk or a madman,

860
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,970
to create confusion about your
intentions and motivations.

861
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,180
Lor Your opponent into under estimating
your ability until overcompensate

862
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:09,390
overconfident. He drops his
guard, then you may attack. Yeah,

863
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:13,100
that like the movie white men can't jump.
You ever see that?

864
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,840
So he did it woody. Oh, and he
made it like he couldn't play ball.

865
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:21,500
Like he was just this Dork Geek,
what do you call a chump, whatever.

866
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:24,350
That's what they'd call him chump.
Like he's Super Dorky.

867
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,160
He goes and everyone else
is just so cool and boom,

868
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,930
flashy and all this stuff. He comes in,
he's a super nerdy and you know, boom.

869
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:35,070
Of course they pay a cam, you know,
kind of thing. And then he beats him.

870
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,260
Would he beat them with flashiness or
would he beat them with, with traditional,

871
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,270
let's call it just who's your
style? Hardworking. Yeah.

872
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,250
Well no, he had legitimate
skill. He was like this. So yeah,

873
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:53,510
he'd come in, he'd be
Super Dorky. And then, um,

874
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,140
at first he tricked them.
So he came in the introduction to him.

875
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,800
He was like the acting all Dorky. And
then the guys, the Wesley snipes in them,

876
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,480
they're all playing basketball
and they're, you know,

877
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,180
get into little arguments or whatever
won't guy gets hurt or is Bunyan on it or

878
00:54:07,181 --> 00:54:10,920
something. And they're like, hey, we need
another guy. And then the guy who's like,

879
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:15,290
you know, let's, you know, get
him or whatever. So they're
like, Hahaha. You know?

880
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,350
Yeah, you got him. Whatever they
play, he ends up to be pretty good,

881
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:22,890
doesn't show a lot, but he's like pretty
solid. And then they're like, hey,

882
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:25,980
you guys lucked out. You had this
Dorky guy, you guys kind of lucked out.

883
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:28,230
And he's like, Oh yeah, you
know, maybe you did look up,

884
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,820
or maybe I'm just better than you,

885
00:54:29,970 --> 00:54:32,300
but they're already convinced he's the
stork you got in there and I cough.

886
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,370
I'm better than you. He was like, all
right, well, it's been kind of thing.

887
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,300
They're already convinced.
Bull Shark consist scenario.
Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

888
00:54:39,301 --> 00:54:43,950
Same exact thing. Yeah. Yeah.
That's pretty obvious one.

889
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,040
And I think,
I think one thing that,

890
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,820
again to take away from this
is if you know these things,

891
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:55,940
you're less likely to be suckered
in by them. Yeah, that's,

892
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,250
that's the most important thing. Yeah.
That you see the pool shark thing,

893
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,730
I saw a guy who really
clumsily tried to do that.

894
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:04,620
He'd worked in night club,

895
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:08,910
we had a pool table in there and this
guy came in and he like acts like he's

896
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:12,260
like, he comes in and just a normal
guy, he comes in with his own key.

897
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:17,250
Oh by the way, his own pool
stick, which is an indicator.

898
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:22,050
Yeah. Like total giveaway. And he didn't,

899
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:26,520
comes in and then immediately when like
he kind of enters the little scene,

900
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:27,930
you know,
the little area where the pool,

901
00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:31,920
he acts like he's just kind of drunk
and just real oblivious, you know,

902
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:36,270
he just total just switches to a
different guy. And here's the thing, we,

903
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,230
you can't let drunk people walking
around in the bar. So you know,

904
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:43,380
when waitresses or other, or the manager
would come by and they'd be like, Hey,

905
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:46,560
is that guy that guy's to junk? Like, why
are you kind of like keep an eye on him?

906
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:49,800
And I'm like [inaudible], he's
not drunk. He's like acting drunk.

907
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:52,170
So I go talk to them just
to sort of make sure.

908
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:55,590
And he was just like all normal talking
to me. I'm like, no man. But yeah,

909
00:55:55,591 --> 00:55:58,170
he tried no one. I mean it wasn't
like no one to get my phone.

910
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,680
He wouldn't get money from anyone.
Well, here's the thing. No,

911
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,030
because it was like a nightclub.
It wasn't a competitive pool hall.

912
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,970
No one cares. No one's going
to take is, no one's even
gonna bet. They're like, Bro,

913
00:56:09,971 --> 00:56:12,690
we're just cruising. I'm like, why are
you, you know, wanting to bet kind of.

914
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:14,340
I'm not saying that happened,
but I'm saying that's the,

915
00:56:14,341 --> 00:56:18,690
I guess in this day and age you'd have
to be pretty dumb to fall for this.

916
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,390
Anyone who will haul
scenario to beat this guy,

917
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,160
you got to really think you
can beat them. Right. Otherwise

918
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,980
you'd just be dumb. Alright, next,

919
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,810
remove the ladder.
When the enemy has ascended to the roof.

920
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,720
This is another one that kind of is a
little bit contradictory with Bates and

921
00:56:36,721 --> 00:56:38,710
deceptions. Laura, your
enemy into treasures.

922
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:42,220
Treacherous terrain then caught off his
lines of communication and avenue of

923
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:43,810
escape to save himself.

924
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,260
He must fight both your own forces
and the elements of nature. Okay,

925
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:49,350
I see what makes a little bit different.
It's the elements of nature partner.

926
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:49,600
Yeah,

927
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,060
because otherwise we're
just doing something that
we talked about wasn't good,

928
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:55,120
which is don't give them any escape.
Then they're going to fight really hard,

929
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:58,630
but if you put them in a situation
where they've got to fight to both the

930
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:01,060
elements of nature and you,
that makes sense.

931
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,043
Okay.

932
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:08,620
29 deck the tree with false blossoms.

933
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,090
Tying silk blossoms on a dead tree gives
the illusion that the tree is healthy

934
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:17,770
through the use of artifice and disguise.

935
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:21,460
Make something of no value,
appear valuable of no threat.

936
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:26,350
Appear dangerous of no use a peer useful.
Pretty straightforward.

937
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,933
Yeah.

938
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:33,630
No. Who does a lot of that
stilts and your role with stilts?

939
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,030
He like Bates, he puts his
arms, he's super flexible. Yes.

940
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:42,370
And he'll put his arm way over there
and it'll be all obvious. I've,

941
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:44,430
I've tried to tell him
stilts when you hear this,

942
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,480
if you backed off your,

943
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:53,970
your exposure a little bit, it'd
be more believable. Yeah. Right.

944
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,520
Cause it smell real.
It doesn't smell real easily.

945
00:57:56,550 --> 00:57:59,790
He liked taps the ground with his
arm but he sticks it all out there.

946
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,590
Like any bends it enough.

947
00:58:01,591 --> 00:58:04,230
So it's almost an a perfect camera like
we're going to do is go for this but

948
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:06,270
he's so flexible. If you go for
it, he's going to off balance.

949
00:58:06,271 --> 00:58:10,620
He's going to put his hooks in cause
he's six foot something like six foot six

950
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,560
year and super flexible.
You ever think with him,

951
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,840
I don't know if this is the case or not.

952
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,160
We ever think cause I think there's every
once in a while where he's overdoing

953
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:24,040
it because he's trying, you know it's
like a like a charades. You're right.

954
00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:26,080
That might be part of it. Yeah. You know,

955
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,710
he's over doing that so
much that you don't do it.

956
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:31,620
Cause I'd actually actually you're right,
we've had that conversation.

957
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:35,460
He's told me before that sometimes he
would stick something out cause he knew I

958
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:38,850
had it so good that if you just tried to
make it look so obviously I wouldn't go

959
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:41,460
for it. He was right.
He's actually correct.

960
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,220
There's a lot of times when I see him
do something like I am suspect with

961
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:47,190
everything he does, everything
he does, I'm suspect. Yup.

962
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,590
Any 200% like you think you're going
to pass the guard. He's going to,

963
00:58:49,591 --> 00:58:53,910
he's got some little scam
going. Yeah. He's trying to
trick you. Yep. So be careful.

964
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:59,400
Number 30 some scam scam.

965
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,280
It's going to stab you in the door.

966
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,810
Make the host and the
guest exchange roles.

967
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:11,400
You serp leadership in a situation
where you are normally subordinate.

968
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,860
Infiltrate your target initially.

969
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:18,950
Pretend to be a guest to be accepted
but develop from inside and become the

970
00:59:19,321 --> 00:59:22,090
owner later. Tell it's
the same, same, same

971
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,650
hair already talked about with
the fire department scenario

972
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,200
because that method is a lot better than
the method of battleaxe cause you won't

973
00:59:33,891 --> 00:59:36,020
even make it through the front door
if you're holding an ax. Right.

974
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:38,210
Then I'm gonna let you in.
They're actually,

975
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:42,330
the more I kind of listened
to you kind of is the,

976
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,590
the battle ax approach.
Really. Most of the time,

977
00:59:45,591 --> 00:59:47,360
all that does is create another war.

978
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:51,050
He just basically took one war
and made another war in there.

979
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,790
Now you got two major wars, by the
way, that's, it seems to be the result,

980
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,870
you know, just to give
everyone a little bit of relief

981
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,530
where the battle ax is appropriate,

982
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,680
a hundred percent appropriate is
with yourself and your own life.

983
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,310
You know what I mean?
That's the difference. That
doesn't give anybody relief.

984
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:14,210
Yeah, it does. Because you can use that.
You want to use it, you want to use it,

985
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:16,390
but you gotta use it on yourself,
not on herself. I want, Oh,

986
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,320
you're saying people don't
want you to at yourself.

987
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:23,060
How do you going to fix yourself? You
fix it. All right, well listen, I mean,

988
01:00:23,061 --> 01:00:27,050
we'll get that weakness
and no real. Let's see.

989
01:00:27,051 --> 01:00:28,880
That's the exact thing I'm
talking about with you,

990
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,960
because the strange thing is that the
other methodology doesn't work with

991
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:35,360
yourself. If you're like negotiating
with Chris [inaudible]. You know what,

992
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,330
I'm not really that way. He can. I'm
going to play the long game with myself.

993
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,890
I'm just one donut. Not that big of a
deal. I mean really, I don't know. Nope,

994
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,420
don't do that. Battleaxe
yeah, see, so that yet again,

995
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:52,421
it goes along with your whole thing where
I don't want to hear that when I say I

996
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:56,870
want to bring up the battle
ax fright jungle. Right.

997
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:00,380
You want it to be for everyone
else causing the problems.

998
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,940
But that's not the way it works.
Only can use the battleax on yourself.

999
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,120
That's where you use it.
And when you do that,

1000
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:13,130
what you do is you do solve the problem.
It's the actual, so what's interesting,

1001
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,720
there's a dichotomy here I tell
people with, with everyone else,

1002
01:01:17,721 --> 01:01:20,490
don't use the battle ax. That's
where they want to use the battle ax.

1003
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,420
They don't want to use the
battleax on themselves.

1004
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:25,550
But that's where I tell him
to use the battleax. Yeah,

1005
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,790
it's a strange world fair that rights
are out. Life gets a lot easier.

1006
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,910
It's harder at first, but he
ends up easier. But yeah, it's,

1007
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:39,110
it's so 1000 million percent can something
be a thousand million percent? Surely,

1008
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:44,000
but if it could be one of the one
of those things and it's yet again,

1009
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:47,480
one of your things where it's like,
Hey Jocko, I'm trying to do this.

1010
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:49,940
I need to do this. Tell me the
best way to do it, and your,

1011
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:53,090
and your answer isn't okay. This is
how you do this better. It's, hey,

1012
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,790
you don't want to do that. You
want to do this. Oh, by the way,

1013
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:58,280
that's the exact opposite of
what you think you need to do.

1014
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:02,900
That's your whole thing. Same exact thing
with your battle ax analogy. I'm like,

1015
01:02:02,901 --> 01:02:05,960
Hey, I need to take a battle ax to
my boss, man. He just doesn't get it.

1016
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:09,110
All this stuff and you're like,
Oh yeah, oh no, you don't.

1017
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:12,320
You actually have to take the battleax
yourself. That's your whole thing.

1018
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:16,070
Yes it is. Yeah, because if you
take the battle ax your boss,

1019
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:17,450
so you're going to get hit,

1020
01:02:17,451 --> 01:02:20,100
you create another war to
yourself and you cut off the

1021
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,690
the hostility.

1022
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:26,190
You smash the d,

1023
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,050
The hostility that you
have towards your boss.

1024
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,660
If you use the battleax on that hostility
and you start treating them with

1025
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:33,990
respect and trying to
build a relationship, guess
what? You're going to win.

1026
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,910
If you use the battle ox on him,

1027
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,400
he's going to break out a
bigger battle ax and guess what?

1028
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:42,270
He has one because he's the boss.
He's got a much bigger battle ax.

1029
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:45,910
Yes, he does, and technically isn't
that the whole watering the roots thing?

1030
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,133
You know

1031
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,230
the systemic problem solving. Start
with yourself. You know, that's,

1032
01:02:52,231 --> 01:02:55,710
that's definitely part of it.
That's part of it. In their

1033
01:02:57,570 --> 01:03:02,340
next stratagems for desperate situations,

1034
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,920
number 31 the beauty trap.

1035
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:11,090
Send your enemy beautiful women
to cause discord within his camp.

1036
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,370
This strategy can work on three levels.
First,

1037
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:18,450
the ruler becomes so enamored with the
beauty that he neglects his duties and

1038
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:20,330
allows his vigilance to Wayne.

1039
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:25,320
Second other males at court will begin
to display aggressive behavior that

1040
01:03:25,321 --> 01:03:29,070
inflames minor differences, hindering
cooperation and destroying morale.

1041
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:35,300
Third other females at court motivated
by jealousy and envy begin to plot

1042
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:38,910
intrigues further
exacerbating the situation.

1043
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,580
This is also known as the honey trap.

1044
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,740
The honey trap. They do that
on Rambo. First blood part too.

1045
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:52,140
He had that. Remember that cohort, you
have them check him and he had a girl,

1046
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:56,730
a Vietnamese girl, if I'm not mistaken,
and he meets her, her name is Ko.

1047
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,890
Yeah.
So they go and they got to take down,

1048
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:05,900
you know they got to say the Po adobes
and the girl disguises herself as I think

1049
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:11,190
a Vietnamese prostitute if I'm not
mistaken on a moped. Honey trap. Yeah.

1050
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,720
So they're like, oh, neglecting
their duties, all this
stuff. Boom. They come in.

1051
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:20,130
But to add to the whole scenario,
she's like actual warrior either.

1052
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:23,400
So it's like double layers and
you know she's getting after it,

1053
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:27,810
getting totally getting after it.
Check number 32

1054
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,630
the empty Fort Strategy when the enemy
is superior numbers in your situation is

1055
01:04:32,631 --> 01:04:36,950
such that you expect to be overrun that
any moment than drop all pretense of

1056
01:04:36,951 --> 01:04:41,510
military preparedness and act calmly so
that the enemy will think you're setting

1057
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:42,344
an ambush.

1058
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:47,480
The strategy is to be used sparingly
and only after one has first developed a

1059
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:49,550
reputation for military prowess.

1060
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:55,100
This also depends on having a clever
opponent who in proceeding the trap may

1061
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:56,900
overthink his reaction.

1062
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:03,080
Don't takes guts, but I guess
the the, it normally takes guts,

1063
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,410
but you might not have any other choice.
Right?

1064
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,000
Like you're choking your chances like,
okay,

1065
01:05:08,001 --> 01:05:09,650
we're just going to act
like this is no big deal.

1066
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:12,230
Just going to act like
this is no big deal.

1067
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:14,270
Who was telling me a story about that?

1068
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,830
Maybe it was you or it was jade

1069
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,860
about being an Australia where you're
telling me about that was that jade?

1070
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,360
Possibly. What was the
store like? Oh yeah,

1071
01:05:28,361 --> 01:05:32,100
I was telling you going into the alley.
Yeah, I was telling you about jade story.

1072
01:05:32,101 --> 01:05:35,230
Okay. Yeah. Was that on the podcast
that you did that? I don't think so,

1073
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:39,580
but the point is, jade had
a choice act like, okay,

1074
01:05:39,581 --> 01:05:44,530
so he sees a situation could be
hostile, and his choice was like, okay,

1075
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,620
I don't really have a choice here.
I can either act scared,

1076
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:50,920
in which case I'm going to
become a victim that's, that's,

1077
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,850
or I can act nonchalant and there's
a possibility I don't become a victim

1078
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:58,030
because they see that I'm like, whatever.
Right? And so that's what he did.

1079
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,880
And guess what? The guy was like,
good. Hey Man. Oh good. Yeah.

1080
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,890
Luckily we said Australia.
Next

1081
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,970
33 let the enemy's own spy.

1082
01:06:09,971 --> 01:06:14,890
So discord in the enemy camp undermine
your enemy's ability to fight by secretly

1083
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:18,760
causing discord between him and his
friends, allies, advisers, families,

1084
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:20,440
commander soldiers in population.

1085
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:24,820
While he is preoccupied in
settling internal disputes,

1086
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:26,980
his ability to attack or
defend is compromised.

1087
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:33,580
For some reason.
I have the word truth written here,

1088
01:06:35,540 --> 01:06:37,700
and I think the reason,
oh, this is what I have,

1089
01:06:37,701 --> 01:06:40,910
that this is why I have that there. I was
thinking to myself, how do you do this?

1090
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:42,710
And the,

1091
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:47,710
one of the best ways to sow discord
amongst people is to tell them the truth

1092
01:06:48,501 --> 01:06:51,230
about what's happening. How so? Well,

1093
01:06:51,231 --> 01:06:55,550
you've got some enemy camp and you
start, you start saying, hey look,

1094
01:06:56,520 --> 01:07:00,590
you should say, look how look
how the bosses living. God.

1095
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,980
It's just pay attention to how the boss
of it, I'm just telling you the truth.

1096
01:07:03,981 --> 01:07:06,870
The truth is the boss eaten crab
legs every night. You guess what?

1097
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:11,030
You're eating chicken patties. No, no, no.
So I was on the ship, I think it was the,

1098
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:12,740
I think it was a u s as Cleveland,

1099
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:17,270
and there was an underground
newspaper on the ship,

1100
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:22,450
but there was basically leakers
that we're telling the troops,

1101
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,550
the sailors on the ship,

1102
01:07:25,551 --> 01:07:28,460
what they were eating in the
wardroom where the officers were.

1103
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:32,840
That word started getting
around to chicken patties.

1104
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:37,270
Dryton chicken patties for 48 days
straight. You know what? No. Hey,

1105
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,200
that's a lot of chicken patties.
You're not, you're not gonna,

1106
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:40,910
you're not gonna want any
more chicken patties. No,

1107
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,880
but then you get word that they're
eating crab legs. That was the big one.

1108
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,730
I don't even like crab legs,
but everyone else seemed like crab legs.

1109
01:07:46,731 --> 01:07:48,860
They were mad when they found
out that's what the wardrobe.

1110
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,320
So what they did was just
the just telling the truth.

1111
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:58,320
Cause discord. Just tell him
the truth. Yeah, makes sense.

1112
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,530
Now of course you could
weave in some lies, right?

1113
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:05,620
But just I'm saying is oftentimes the
truth is the most powerful weapon.

1114
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:11,000
Yeah.
To cause discord.

1115
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:13,550
Now I'll always tell you that
truth is the most powerful weapon.

1116
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:18,890
Definitely truth is the most
powerful weapon that you
have. Like just in general.

1117
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:20,450
Just in general.
Just in general.

1118
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:22,640
The truth is the most powerful
weapon you have for yourself.

1119
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:25,370
Be truthful with yourself. If you can
be truthful with people around you.

1120
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:30,140
Now does. Does this mean you
tell the truth every single time?

1121
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:31,963
No,
because you,

1122
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,270
sometimes the chicken is dry and you
just need to do that to yourself. Right?

1123
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:38,810
That's a legit, why don't we talk
about that before, but truth,

1124
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:42,980
truth is definitely the most powerful
tool that you have and even when it comes

1125
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:46,250
to creating discord, the best, let me
put it to you this way. Let me just,

1126
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,400
I don't want to go through this
whole tangent, but the best,

1127
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:51,140
if you're going to create discord,

1128
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:56,530
it's more powerful to create discord using
the truth than it is trying to create

1129
01:08:56,751 --> 01:09:01,640
discord because the lie can be unwound,
figured out the truth when they go,

1130
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:06,320
well, no, that's not true,
and then you go, oh wait, that
is true as a real problem.

1131
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:12,580
34 inflict injury on oneself to when the
enemy's trust pretending to be injured

1132
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,420
has two possible
applications in the first.

1133
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:20,540
The enemy's lulled into relaxing his
guard since he no longer considers you an

1134
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,374
immediate threat.

1135
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:26,180
The second is a way of ingratiating
yourself to your enemy by pretending the

1136
01:09:26,181 --> 01:09:29,660
energy the injury was
caused by a mutual enemy.

1137
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,560
Build that little bit of trust.
Remember when I talked about,

1138
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:41,480
remember when I talked about when you,
if you come to me and you're emotional,

1139
01:09:42,290 --> 01:09:46,310
you're all mad about something and I
have to to tamper down the emotion,

1140
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:49,160
but I can't. I have to show you some
of the same emotion. I reflect it,

1141
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:53,090
but I diminish it a little bit. Yeah.
That's a way of building trust between us.

1142
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:55,400
Right? Well, it's the same
thing. If I'm, I called liquid,

1143
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,410
you come and look what
they did to me and I go,

1144
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:02,360
look what they did to me to say thing.
They wounded me to look at this.

1145
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:07,820
I'm also mad at them. We're a team now.
I do that with my daughter, by the way.

1146
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,820
What's a, when she, she
had a hangnail last night,

1147
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,340
even hangnail and she didn't
know what a hang nail is.

1148
01:10:13,341 --> 01:10:17,770
I think it's her first hangnail
just five sad. It's sad.

1149
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,850
All those hanging on.
What hangnails coming your way.

1150
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:26,750
All those hangnail future for
a, so I'm like, yeah, I see.

1151
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:29,390
Just little things. Yeah. That used to
happen to me when I was a little too,

1152
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:34,070
so it's kind of like, oh, we both kind
of have that same scenario. Same thing,

1153
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:37,850
dude. Mutual. Hey, mail, hatred. You know,

1154
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:40,800
let's bring the team together
and uniting against hang nails.

1155
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,880
I'm telling you it's real.
It's real name, ma'am.

1156
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,920
I'm a hundred percent onboard.
Hanging rails are real.

1157
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:51,980
I didn't know you had hangnails
man, when I have them too tight,

1158
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,060
a little bit of bond.

1159
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:58,390
35 chain stratagems in important matters,

1160
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:03,530
one should use several stratagems applied
simultaneously after another as an a

1161
01:11:03,531 --> 01:11:07,850
chain of stratagems. Keep different
plans operating in an overall scheme.

1162
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:11,780
However, in this manner,
if any one stratagem fails,

1163
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:14,910
then the chain breaks and
the whole scheme fails.

1164
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:18,210
Now I completely agree with the
first part of this, which is, yeah,

1165
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:20,930
you should train these things together,
which is obviously what we do in Jujitsu.

1166
01:11:21,030 --> 01:11:22,470
You use one move in that
setting up another move,

1167
01:11:22,471 --> 01:11:24,050
which is setting up another move,
moving the defense. That one's,

1168
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:27,870
that's another move, but I don't agree
with the fact that if one of them breaks,

1169
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,410
they all the whole thing falls apart,
but that shouldn't be necessarily true.

1170
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,230
You should set up your strategy gyms,

1171
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:37,800
you're stratagems that you
expect that some of them are not,

1172
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,990
are going to fail a little bit and
that's okay because that's why he got the

1173
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:44,560
backup ones right. Am I wrong?
I don't think you're wrong. No.

1174
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:49,740
And chaining things together.
That's you have to do that.

1175
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:53,210
You have to hit from multiple angles
and you have to have, that's how,

1176
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,760
that's the Ooda loop, right? That's okay,

1177
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,580
I'm going to do this and then you're
going to react. I'm going to do this,

1178
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:57,750
I'm gonna be there.
And when the next one there,

1179
01:11:57,751 --> 01:12:00,900
where the next one in there with the
next one having a heads up on things make

1180
01:12:00,901 --> 01:12:03,780
such a big difference.
In other words,

1181
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:09,810
just so much of winning in Jujitsu is
that I know what you're gonna do before

1182
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:10,644
you do it.

1183
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,070
So much of winning in combat is I know
what you're going to do before you do it.

1184
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,560
Setting these things up properly,

1185
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:20,580
chaining them together so that the
enemy doesn't know the opponent,

1186
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:24,720
doesn't know the next thing in
the chain, but you do. Yeah.

1187
01:12:25,850 --> 01:12:28,120
Yeah. I think he, that's powerful. Yeah,

1188
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,660
I agree that it seems like you're
looking at it like the, the,

1189
01:12:32,661 --> 01:12:37,010
the chain of stratagems is like a totem
pole where it should be like a tree or

1190
01:12:37,011 --> 01:12:40,220
like a web or something where you can
kind of go and this can break off and,

1191
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:42,460
but yeah,
his one is like,

1192
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:47,650
like a straight up like actual chain
know one link breaks. It's like yes,

1193
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,610
but true.

1194
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:53,290
Last one,
number 36

1195
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:58,770
if all else fails,
retreat,

1196
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,423
important one.

1197
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:06,260
If it becomes obvious that your current
course of action will lead to defeat,

1198
01:13:06,290 --> 01:13:10,130
then retreat and regroup
when you're aside is losing.

1199
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:13,310
There are only three choices.
Remaining. Surrender,

1200
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:17,060
compromise or escape.

1201
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:21,650
Surrender is complete defeat.

1202
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,100
We don't want that.
Compromise is half. Defeat

1203
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:34,190
might be an okay outcome, especially
when compared to the alternative,

1204
01:13:34,191 --> 01:13:36,440
which is just surrender,
which is total defeat.

1205
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:40,640
But escape is not defeat.

1206
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:41,633
Hmm.

1207
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:45,150
As long as you are not defeated,

1208
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,060
you will still have a chance.

1209
01:13:51,680 --> 01:13:56,300
And I think that's a fitting end to this.
And again,

1210
01:13:56,301 --> 01:13:58,430
this is something that people
get wrapped around all the time.

1211
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,260
They don't want to give up,
they don't want to give up.

1212
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:03,050
They don't want to give up.
In skydiving,

1213
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:08,230
you have a malfunction. If
you have a malfunction, you,

1214
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,890
you try and fix it for a little while at

1215
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:16,450
2000 feet. I think it was what
I learned in the military.

1216
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:18,843
Free Fall

1217
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:23,120
at 2000 feet, you make the decision, I'm
not going to get that parachute open.

1218
01:14:23,180 --> 01:14:25,430
I'm going to cut that one away.
I'm going to bring out my secondary.

1219
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:29,090
But guys would, you know,
in the parachute world,

1220
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,710
and right now the parachutes are getting
so good that it's, it's a lot more rare.

1221
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:39,070
But guys would get target fixation on
trying to fix the bad parachute that was

1222
01:14:39,471 --> 01:14:42,500
up there and they'd look at it and look
at it and try and fix it and try and fix

1223
01:14:42,501 --> 01:14:46,290
it and try and fix it and try and fix
it. And then they, they did hit. So

1224
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:51,660
sometimes you got to retreat.
It's okay.

1225
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:55,483
Yeah,

1226
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:59,790
it's okay. Surrender is complete.
Defeat. Compromise is half the feet,

1227
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:04,560
but escape is not defeat it.
As long as you are not defeated,

1228
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:09,570
you still have a chance. So retreating
is smart. Sometimes it's okay.

1229
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:14,660
And I think that's a good lesson.
It's okay to retreat but never,

1230
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:17,120
never surrender.

1231
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:22,580
And that's that book,

1232
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:27,500
which definitely some good lessons
in there running some new ones,

1233
01:15:27,501 --> 01:15:28,940
reinforced some other ones,

1234
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:34,990
hoping that everyone out there listening
learned something from that too.

1235
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:41,290
And if you did any want to
give the podcasts some support

1236
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,633
Baja

1237
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:49,040
and here's how you can do it and support
yourself by the way actually could be

1238
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:52,970
the more important thing. I think so. Yes.
I think it's the more important thing.

1239
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:55,580
Yeah man. Cause he yet
like on the plane, right?

1240
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:58,490
You know the oxygen masks
since coming down real. Right.

1241
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,780
You can't just start putting the mask on
your kid. No. What if you suffered Kate?

1242
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:06,290
Yup. Can't help. Nobody knows
where it just help yourself first.

1243
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:11,000
You can't support what we're doing here
if you're not on the path. Exactly right.

1244
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,100
Yeah. That's the primary thing.
Yeah. That's what we're about

1245
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:18,320
to begin.
Good way.

1246
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:23,410
Let's start with the origin feeding name
for the way to begin the support and

1247
01:16:23,481 --> 01:16:28,460
get it. Origin layers in the industry,
we call it those layers. Anyway, origin.

1248
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:32,930
This is what origins is
a American made company

1249
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,230
that delivers American made
products starting with geese,

1250
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:41,200
Jujitsu gies for Jujitsu,

1251
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,620
not just generic gies name on it.

1252
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,370
Yeah. Not that, no, not generic.

1253
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:50,830
I'm telling you that that's aren't the
kind of geese where you'd be like, Hey,

1254
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:53,940
you know what, I think I'm going to
go down to the market right now. Yeah.

1255
01:16:54,010 --> 01:16:55,750
I'm going to put on my g you don't,

1256
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:58,120
you maybe if you're doing that you'd
maybe don't need an origin gay.

1257
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:00,030
You get whatever you who
go down to the market.

1258
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,840
But if you're doing Jujitsu with your g
yeah. We recommend you go with uh, the,

1259
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:10,190
the origin g which is made in America,
which is awesome.

1260
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:14,240
The cotton is grown. Yeah. It's
grown here. American hands.

1261
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:18,530
People are working, people are working
in Maine. We're bringing that back.

1262
01:17:18,620 --> 01:17:22,820
So yeah. Get those and rash
guards as well. Yeah. Woven,

1263
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,630
woven material here. Yeah, they kind
of got everything. They got, uh,

1264
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:32,190
you know, regular clothes as well.
Joggers, sweat suits. [inaudible].

1265
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:34,670
I was having a discussion,
which I'm not going to go into,

1266
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,440
but I will go into this
part of the discussion.

1267
01:17:36,441 --> 01:17:40,670
I was in discussion with someone that
was like basically telling me like, well,

1268
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:44,240
you know this, this business,
this business is hard.

1269
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,400
What we do is hard in this business.

1270
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:49,190
You're trying to tell me that what they
were doing in this business was hard.

1271
01:17:49,890 --> 01:17:52,190
I was like, Hey, it's not that hard

1272
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:57,470
what you're doing and trust me, what
they're doing is not that hard. Trust me.

1273
01:17:57,471 --> 01:17:59,790
There's some businesses I work
with a lot of different businesses.

1274
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:03,050
I'm complex businesses out there
in the world. Really Complex.

1275
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:06,470
The business particularly that I was
talking to that was having this discussion

1276
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:09,040
with, that was telling me how
hard their business was, which,

1277
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,480
what does that sound like to you
when someone's like, Oh, you know,

1278
01:18:11,481 --> 01:18:14,570
it's really hard. That's an excuse.
Of course. Hey, if it was easy,

1279
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,870
everyone would be doing it, right?
Yeah. You know, it's really hard.

1280
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:20,540
This business is really hard and I
was like, you want to talk about hard?

1281
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:26,620
I'm like tried getting an ancient loom
up and running and weaving material that

1282
01:18:30,021 --> 01:18:33,800
hasn't been done in 40 years.
Here in America we've,

1283
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:37,950
there's 8 million little
threads going into this thing.

1284
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:42,470
Try sorting that out. Telling me your
business is hard. Yeah, that seems hard.

1285
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:46,880
That's hard. But it's being done
right here in America at origin.

1286
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,380
Really good stuff on there.
Also supplements,

1287
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,970
Jocko supplements,
joint warfare,

1288
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:00,860
Krill oil and discipline and milk.
So consider these four.

1289
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:03,590
They all kind of play into each other.
Joint Warfare,

1290
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:08,570
obviously warfare against degeneration
of joints, not against your joints.

1291
01:19:08,571 --> 01:19:13,340
It's for the joints. It's your joint
sweet Jean War on degeneration anyway,

1292
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:16,550
however you want to spin it. And then
the lessons for your joints. Krill oil,

1293
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:20,420
same thing. Omega threes really
good for general health as well.

1294
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,260
If you like protein supplements.
Moke see what I did there.

1295
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:28,040
I didn't call it protein powder.
That's good. That's good.

1296
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,640
It's a very understated too, which I'm
down with. You can not understate it.

1297
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:36,170
Yeah cause the bottom line is if you
like delicious things in the world,

1298
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:41,480
you're going to like milk.
So milk is peanut or not peanut butter.

1299
01:19:41,481 --> 01:19:44,240
It's good to be. It's about the
chocolate butter. Yeah, those are,

1300
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,890
those are inbound.
Yeah.

1301
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:50,630
Someone sent me a picture tweet,
I think it was on Twitter.

1302
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:55,910
One had chocolate milk, jug
other hand milk. He said,

1303
01:19:55,911 --> 01:19:57,770
I'm going to take it for
the team to the experiment.

1304
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:02,330
Remember I said mix the milk with
chocolate milk. Might be too chocolaty.

1305
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:06,220
Might be he just said he's going to do it.
He didn't report that verdict.

1306
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,220
That's kind of just indicated

1307
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,520
he was commencing with the
experiment that's Kinda jacked up.

1308
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:15,180
We will have mark at the immersion camp,
Jujitsu immersion camp,

1309
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:19,680
August 26 through September 2nd
up in Maine on Echo Lake layers.

1310
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,780
So come up and hang out with me with Lafe,
with echo,

1311
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:29,370
with Dave Burke. Still
not 100% on JP, but yeah,

1312
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:33,630
we're going to be up there in Maine
doing Jujitsu and hanging out.

1313
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:37,890
Oh and D Dean lister. Oh yeah. No big
deal. The muster and Andy's going to,

1314
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,160
it looks like Andy's going Burke.
Andy Burke's gonna be going.

1315
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:45,180
So we will be all just training and
getting after it. And hanging out.

1316
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:48,900
Here's the thing, it doesn't sound as
dealt when we were they hanging out.

1317
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:51,490
But here's the thing.
It is ultimately cause you can learn.

1318
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:55,170
You can only do Jujitsu. How many hours
a day can you do Jiu Jitsu? You know,

1319
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,590
it depends on who you are. Obviously
call it eight. We'll call it eight.

1320
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:02,370
So eight and eight. So eight hours.
Then you sleep for eight hours.

1321
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,920
What does that leave you
ate more so more hours.

1322
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:07,290
You got to fill those eight hours
I hanging out. That's eight hours.

1323
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:12,050
Eight hours a crew. Could we cruising?
Cruising. Sorry. I'll be cooking big time.

1324
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:13,770
If I'm not doing this.
You should actually,

1325
01:21:14,010 --> 01:21:17,850
so I'll be halfway in halfway out
because you've got the injury limited,

1326
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:23,010
limited, limited, but we'll, we'll
just say limit anyway. Yes, yes.

1327
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:26,160
August 26th to September 2nd.
Is it

1328
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:32,870
also good way to support his go
to Jocko store.com that's right.

1329
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,210
Chocolate is a store. It's
called Jocko store. Anyway,

1330
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:41,670
it's where you can get tee shirts,
rash guards, hoodies, hats, you know,

1331
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,340
all these stuff.
A products,

1332
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:47,250
we'll say that we put out
discipline equals freedom shirts.

1333
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:53,310
What's the new one? What did
I put on there that's new. Oh,

1334
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:57,040
is there a new discipline equals
freedom shirt. Is that up yet? Yes,

1335
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:02,070
it's not up yet. It will be up in a couple
of weeks. It'll be up in a couple of,

1336
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,590
maybe even one week.
So it could be up technically by the time.

1337
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:08,900
So it's so it's up. It's up, right?
It's cool. The new shirt is up. Yeah,

1338
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,700
just one equals three new one. Um,
but yeah, if you want to represent,

1339
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:15,600
go there Jocko. store.com. Use
the word represent. I like that.

1340
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:21,440
There it is.
I think it's the new one is uh,

1341
01:22:21,690 --> 01:22:26,490
take the high ground or the high
ground. I'll take you. That's a fact.

1342
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,500
Something like that. Shit. Unless if you,
um, actually where we email list, right.

1343
01:22:31,501 --> 01:22:32,610
And I don't really talk about this,

1344
01:22:32,611 --> 01:22:35,100
offer it and didn't want
it to be an annoying thing.

1345
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:36,480
You know how sometimes
you go to a website,

1346
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:38,720
it'll pop up in your face
and you can't like move,

1347
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:43,650
you know,
I try not to because people want to,

1348
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:46,950
they actually used the word they
want to capture. Capture. Yeah.

1349
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:50,190
Capture your email.
Yeah. Technically, yeah.

1350
01:22:50,191 --> 01:22:52,480
I don't want to capture
when we're so out in you and

1351
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,560
what is not in the game. Like
you, you just said like how,

1352
01:22:58,561 --> 01:23:02,940
I mean even your tone indicated how
you feel when a pop up with a form,

1353
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:06,100
you know, comes in. It's
kind of like when you um,

1354
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:08,650
like let's say you go on a first date
with someone and they give you like a

1355
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:10,240
contract or something.
It's Kinda like, hey,

1356
01:23:10,241 --> 01:23:13,650
sign this before we can take any steps
forward with what we already plan.

1357
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:18,230
We were doing, by the way anyway.
I know we do have an email list.

1358
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:22,390
Like you can put your email and sign
up for the email list if you want.

1359
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,580
And it's there.
It's accessible,

1360
01:23:24,690 --> 01:23:28,240
but I think it's on the bottom from
Nancy on the other website on the side

1361
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:29,530
anyway.
It's there.

1362
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:34,390
It will not be a pop up in
here and forever. No ever,

1363
01:23:34,391 --> 01:23:38,710
ever, ever. And furthermore,
if you sign up for that,

1364
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:42,130
you won't get the daily,
Oh you know,

1365
01:23:42,131 --> 01:23:45,490
this and that and this and that and this
everyday because let's face it, Kay,

1366
01:23:45,530 --> 01:23:49,960
I signed up for,
I think it was bud k it's called,

1367
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,940
it's like knives and stuff.
They're just cool. Nice.

1368
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:56,020
So I signed up for that one and every
single day man, I'm getting the thing.

1369
01:23:56,021 --> 01:23:59,950
I'm like, cool. The first day
I'm like, cool, that's cool.
Second day I'm like, cool.

1370
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:04,780
That's kind of the same thing as you sent
me yesterday, whatever. Daily man, daily.

1371
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:07,060
So that feeling I got,

1372
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:11,500
I don't want other people to have that
feeling about Jocko store. So anyway,

1373
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:13,570
you can sign up for the
email list if you want.

1374
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:17,860
And what I will send
you every four months,

1375
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,850
if ever, I'll send you an
email that says like, okay,

1376
01:24:21,851 --> 01:24:24,310
if there's a new shirt
that everyone was required,

1377
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:28,570
you know how like take the high road or
the high road of take you like people.

1378
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:32,170
So many people were emailing me saying,
hey, we should do this one, do this,

1379
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:35,620
should do. So it's kind of that, you
know, it's like everyone's input. Okay,

1380
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:39,160
new shirt, boom on email and
everybody, okay, there's a new show.

1381
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:43,610
It's like that kind of stuff and it's
very rare check. I don't want it.

1382
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,280
You've got an input through it before too.

1383
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:48,490
I remember one time you're asked for
color, right? Right. Yes. So yeah,

1384
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:50,530
that kind of stuff. It won't
be annoying stuff like, hey,

1385
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:52,870
three things that you don't
care about clicks, you know,

1386
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,740
I won't do that stuff ever,
ever, ever check nonetheless.

1387
01:24:56,800 --> 01:25:00,220
That's what's going on Jocko. store.com
if you want to represent, get some stuff,

1388
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:03,030
get some stuff, good way to support. We're

1389
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:07,600
also subscribe to the podcast, this
podcast, iTunes, wherever, Google play,

1390
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:10,060
stitcher,
leave reviews and all that stuff.

1391
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:12,850
And also if you didn't know we
got the warrior kid podcast,

1392
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,740
which yeah,

1393
01:25:16,210 --> 01:25:20,410
you might not think that you would
listen to it, but if you've got kids,

1394
01:25:20,411 --> 01:25:25,180
definitely they'll dig it and
good podcast to listen to.

1395
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:26,163
Lately.
I've been,

1396
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:31,560
lately I've been telling the stories from
uncle Jake from when uncle Jake was a

1397
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:33,850
kid.

1398
01:25:33,850 --> 01:25:38,850
Uncle Jake is sharing stories
of his childhood that have
little lessons in them.

1399
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:44,620
Big lesson, even big lessons and,
but, but they're not they're stories.

1400
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:45,730
Yep.

1401
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:50,730
And that's been kind of the direction the
last couple of podcasts have had a uh,

1402
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,180
a story from uncle Jake story from
Uncle Jake that we can all learn from.

1403
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,480
So that is the warrior kid podcast.

1404
01:25:59,110 --> 01:26:02,800
I answer some questions from for more
of your kids and then they're short too.

1405
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:04,190
They're 20 minutes

1406
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:08,220
because kids should not be sitting
around listening to a four hour podcasts.

1407
01:26:08,221 --> 01:26:11,750
We only do that cause we got to like
work to do commute and all that stuff.

1408
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,410
Yard work. Yeah, it's good. It's
kind of good for the parent actually.

1409
01:26:15,411 --> 01:26:17,800
Really good for the parents
and teachers by the way. No,

1410
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,620
I've gotten great feedback from parents
and teachers. Absolutely. You're awesome.

1411
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:25,540
These quiz questions, the Q
and a questions, you know,

1412
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:28,430
they send in and you
answer them eloquently.

1413
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:33,110
I might add uncle Jack's pretty eloquent.
Yeah, I like to think so for sure.

1414
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,120
Uh, but you know, in real life these,

1415
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:41,060
these kids ask their parents these
questions or the teacher, you know,

1416
01:26:41,210 --> 01:26:43,820
and sometimes, you know,
maybe the teacher on the spot,

1417
01:26:43,821 --> 01:26:46,070
maybe he's busy or maybe they don't
know or something like that. So like,

1418
01:26:46,071 --> 01:26:48,810
you know, I, I see it, I
know that I do it for myself.

1419
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,360
When I listened to him
I'm like, okay, boom.

1420
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:54,470
Cause I've heard that question before and
these answers a little bit better than

1421
01:26:54,471 --> 01:26:57,820
mine. You know, Jack, uh,

1422
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:01,700
also the youtube channel. Yeah.
We've got a youtube channel,

1423
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:07,240
it's called Jocko podcast and that's
where echo puts the videos and the video

1424
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:11,770
excerpts and enhanced video excerpts.

1425
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:16,760
So you can check that out too, which
is cool. And Yeah, yeah, do that.

1426
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:20,150
It's good. A good way to
support for sure. Subscribe to,

1427
01:27:20,151 --> 01:27:22,160
you already said iTunes and stuff,
Google play.

1428
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:26,720
So that's a good way to start that
seemingly an easy obvious thing,

1429
01:27:26,721 --> 01:27:31,580
but it is a good way to
support legitimately check also

1430
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:37,730
on it.com/jocko by the
way. Okay. What is on it?

1431
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,500
We all know it on and it is,
but if you don't know,

1432
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:43,490
it's where you can get
the best fitness gear.

1433
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:47,010
It's where you get all mine.
Oh,

1434
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:51,680
it's going to get a bag or
like the sandbag things. Yeah,

1435
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:55,970
I got one. Okay. Yeah, they're
good. They're good. Yeah.

1436
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,500
Like so it was,

1437
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:02,300
I forget it was good for the
big functional strategy. Yeah.

1438
01:28:02,301 --> 01:28:05,000
Like you know how, um, do you know
what I've got to figure out though.

1439
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:09,120
Remember that bag that they had
up in Maine, the 200 pound bag,

1440
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:13,970
I got to figure out what the deal is
with that so I can rehearse. Actually,

1441
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:14,804
it's pretty simple.

1442
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,360
If you've got to make a game 10 10
adjustment to do it, you'd be like, okay,

1443
01:28:20,361 --> 01:28:24,290
this is mark. Depress it. No, just clean
it. Yeah. Put it over your shoulder.

1444
01:28:24,291 --> 01:28:26,720
You have to shoulder. Yeah.
Okay. So the thing is,

1445
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:30,620
and I tell me if this is cheating.
Okay. So to lay out the scenario,

1446
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:35,600
there's a 200 pound bag of gravel.
Not that's what it is. Yeah.

1447
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,500
200 pounds, which is him.
No handles, no handles.

1448
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:43,880
It's a sack of gravel,
not a canvas like made out of the either.

1449
01:28:43,881 --> 01:28:47,870
It's like nylon. Yeah. So it's real flowy.

1450
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:52,370
200 pounds dead. You'd see dead
weight. It's extra dead weight anyway.

1451
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,760
So then you got to just put it on
your shoulder. That's it. Pick it up,

1452
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,900
pick it up off the ground, putting your
show. So tell me if this is cheating.

1453
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:01,260
So I did it in a,

1454
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:06,690
I succeeded but I try not the first time
I tried it once and I was like whoa.

1455
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:12,450
And you know it falls down and
I'm like man. But uh, Mike,

1456
01:29:13,170 --> 01:29:15,270
one of the guys there, he said, hey,

1457
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,530
when you lift it up first you got to keep
the weight on the forward part because

1458
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:20,400
even when you lift it up,

1459
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:24,000
it kind of divides the bag kind of
India because it flows, you know,

1460
01:29:24,001 --> 01:29:26,400
all the gravel kind of flows to the,
to the ends or whatever.

1461
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:28,890
You got to divide it up.
But when you divide it up,

1462
01:29:28,891 --> 01:29:32,430
you got to keep more of the weight.
More on the, on the, on the front part,

1463
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,150
not on the,

1464
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:36,420
the part closer to you because it'll
just flow down and it just doesn't work.

1465
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:42,060
His, his explanation way more short
than that. But um, so is that cheating?

1466
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:45,810
So I was like, all right, I did it
and then I, and then it was easy. No,

1467
01:29:45,840 --> 01:29:49,920
it's not easy. Okay. So it's, yeah, it's
hard. Like if you practice or something,

1468
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:53,610
it'll be easy course. I mean, you're
strong enough to do it for sure.

1469
01:29:54,210 --> 01:29:57,750
But the technique or some techniques
to get it up there. Yeah, it's, it's,

1470
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:03,030
it's hard. But nonetheless, um,
the, my point was with the bag is,

1471
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,420
you know how,
you know,

1472
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:06,840
you lift a bunch of weights and
this guy and or me or whatever,

1473
01:30:06,841 --> 01:30:11,280
we can bench a lot, squat
a lot. But then, you know,

1474
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:14,010
when you're doing like yard
work and you gotta I dunno,

1475
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:17,970
shovel a bunch of dirty wheelbarrow and
you're picking it up and you're trying

1476
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:19,770
to lift it up this little
hill and you're like,

1477
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,750
well, the second your role with guys
that work construction, they have,

1478
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,320
they have legit strength
that comes to the other side.

1479
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:27,490
Exactly right. So I'm like, man,

1480
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,660
I'll buy one of these bags and just sort
of like have it part of the workout,

1481
01:30:31,730 --> 01:30:33,830
you know,
do some hills or something with it.

1482
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:39,160
But anyway, on it.com/ [inaudible] and
there's a lot of cool stuff on there.

1483
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,260
Then he says,
and kettle bells and whatnot,

1484
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:46,260
all kinds of good stuff. Uh, psychological
warfare album being get on iTunes,

1485
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:48,420
Google play and be through.
We're working on the second one.

1486
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:53,190
If you got something you want to
meet to address psychologically,

1487
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:58,250
let me know now and I'll start putting
together a little list and we'll get it

1488
01:30:59,071 --> 01:31:02,200
into your brain psychologically.
Yep.

1489
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,430
And speaking of which,
speaking of psychological,

1490
01:31:05,431 --> 01:31:08,720
how's this for a psychological right
here. Hold on. Here we go. This,

1491
01:31:12,130 --> 01:31:15,660
you know that is that right there?
That's Jocko white tea in a can.

1492
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:19,170
You can get it.
You can get it at Amazon right now.

1493
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:23,430
It's available in Canada
too and it tastes delicious,

1494
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:27,870
which is fine. You want things, it tastes
good. That's good. It's good for you.

1495
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:31,590
Replaced the crap that you drink,
the energy drinks that you drink.

1496
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,670
Get rid of him. Get this instead.
You will absolutely feel better.

1497
01:31:35,671 --> 01:31:38,310
You'll be more healthy and bonus.

1498
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,000
You'll be able to deadlift hundred
percent guaranteed. 8,000 pounds,

1499
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:45,750
so that's right there. I was good
enough. While you're on Amazon as well,

1500
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:50,190
you can get some books.
We got the way of the warrior kid books.

1501
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,130
Just check them out. Just check them
out. That's my statement. Check them out.

1502
01:31:56,220 --> 01:32:00,610
Warrior kid books, feedbacks.
Unbelievable kids getting after it.

1503
01:32:01,210 --> 01:32:05,140
Once they read those books, the
discipline equals freedom field manual.

1504
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:07,780
How to get after it.

1505
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:13,110
Demand you on how to get after it and
kind of stay after it and stay because if

1506
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:17,080
you get after it for a couple hours and
then that's all the getting after you're

1507
01:32:17,081 --> 01:32:21,130
doing.
If you crack that book open though,

1508
01:32:21,310 --> 01:32:25,000
you'll see this crack it open.
If you want to listen to it,

1509
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,240
you can get it as an album with
tracks, iTunes, Google play, all that.

1510
01:32:29,241 --> 01:32:32,570
It's not on audible,
extreme ownerships.

1511
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,840
The other book been out for awhile.

1512
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,800
It's still people still buying
it and it's about leadership.

1513
01:32:41,170 --> 01:32:43,260
It's about combat leadership in how to

1514
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:50,120
use combat leadership principles in your
business and your life and obviously in

1515
01:32:50,121 --> 01:32:53,600
combat as well. And then on top of that
life and I have a new book that we are,

1516
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:55,280
I keep saying that we just finished it.

1517
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,020
I think it was Tim
Ferriss I heard say like,

1518
01:32:57,110 --> 01:33:00,050
oh he was writing a book and he
goes yeah I'm done with my book.

1519
01:33:00,051 --> 01:33:03,710
And one of his friends that was a writer
was like okay cool you're 50% there and

1520
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:05,780
that's the truth.
When you get done writing it,

1521
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:08,780
you're 50% there cause there's a ton
of work that you still have to do.

1522
01:33:09,170 --> 01:33:14,170
I finished around of edits yesterday
and what's cool is reading the book,

1523
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:18,230
I'm super stoked on the book and people
are going to get a lot out of it.

1524
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:19,910
It's called the dichotomy of leadership.

1525
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:25,180
It comes out September 25th my publisher
who listens to this podcast who hears

1526
01:33:26,511 --> 01:33:30,860
me say these things doesn't get it
or not going to order enough books.

1527
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:31,611
They're like,
well you know,

1528
01:33:31,611 --> 01:33:33,380
you never know when we don't
want to take too much risk.

1529
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:38,330
Order the book now so that you get a
book when it comes out first the dish,

1530
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:40,040
you don't want second a dish,

1531
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:43,940
third a and that's lifetime evidence
that you weren't in the game.

1532
01:33:44,810 --> 01:33:48,380
Don't let it happen. And then when
you meet me and you're like, Hey,

1533
01:33:48,381 --> 01:33:50,150
can you sign in? You're signing
my book. And I was like, cool,

1534
01:33:50,151 --> 01:33:53,570
y'all sign your second edition sadness.

1535
01:33:54,740 --> 01:33:59,330
The first edition I'll be like,
hey we go back, we go back.

1536
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:03,530
So like the second edition you'll just
sort of sign your name and then with a

1537
01:34:03,531 --> 01:34:04,430
line or something.

1538
01:34:04,431 --> 01:34:09,431
But the first edition of the Games that
you went to supports that whole one,

1539
01:34:09,921 --> 01:34:14,900
and we are here together. Oh, second
edition. How you doing? Poser.

1540
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:20,210
Poser. If you get the
second dish. Well, anyways,

1541
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:21,080
all kidding aside.

1542
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:25,550
That's coming out September 25th if you
want to get that dichotomy of leadership,

1543
