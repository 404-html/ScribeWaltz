00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,890
This is Jocko podcast number
one 70 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,990
Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good
evening. It is time for some Q and a.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,260
Okay. It has been awhile.
It's been awhile for sure.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,770
So let's, yeah, from the interwebs. Yes,

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,550
indeed. As it is said.
Okay. First Question Jocko.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,090
I'm taking over leadership of a team of
six people to I know and for I don't.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,250
When you've taken over leadership,

8
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:37,251
did you one give a group talk to meet
with each individual in three what did you

9
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:43,740
say? Good question. Yes.
Obviously give a group talk.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,070
That's affirmative. You get
everyone together. Hey guys,

11
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,730
my name is bill [inaudible].

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,790
I came from this place
I'm here to take over.

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,300
Now there's a some judgment calls Jeff
to make because you're going to introduce

14
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:04,680
yourself, but if you're taking over a
well functioning team, then guess what?

15
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:09,681
You're not going into revamp everything
immediately cause everything's going

16
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,380
fine. So your hey, I'm happy to be working
with you guys looking forward to it.

17
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:16,440
I know you guys have a great reputation.
Glad to be a part of the team. Awesome.

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,310
If you have any questions, let
me know. I'm here. That's easy.

19
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:23,150
If you're taking over a team
that's not working well, right,

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,640
there's problems and that's why somebody
got fired and that's why you're coming

21
00:01:25,641 --> 00:01:28,320
in there. You might need to address
some of those things. Hey listen,

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,920
I know things have been a
little off track. I'm going
to look at what's going on.

23
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,980
I'm going to take input from you guys.
We probably need to make some changes.

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,770
We're going to do it together as a team.
That's where we're moving from here.

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,790
We need to get back to where we're
supposed to be. Boom. Something like that.

26
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:42,481
And again,

27
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:45,210
there's gonna be people on that team that
had been busting their ass and working

28
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:48,690
really hard. And if you go in there
and just disparage everyone there,

29
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,870
you're going to start off
on the wrong foot. So yeah,

30
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,080
have the keep it pretty broad when
you meet the whole group, hey,

31
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:57,960
this is who I am, this is where I came
from, this is what I'm looking forward to.

32
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,580
All that stuff. And then yes. Do
you meet with people individually?

33
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,590
Absolutely. You go around, you
meet with them and when you,

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,920
what do you talk to him about and
you talked to them about them.

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,800
We talked to them about them.
You want to know about them,

36
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,380
you want to know who they are.
You want to know what their,

37
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,280
what their family situation is, what
their interests are, what's going on,

38
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,770
how they feel about the transitions
that have been taken place.

39
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:21,900
A little bit of that stuff is
not about you, it's about them.

40
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,240
So go yes and talked to everyone. Take
notes. Maybe not right in front of them.

41
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,780
So you look like a nerd but
you know afterwards you go,

42
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:34,980
hey bill has three kids.
His wife also works at the company,

43
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,930
he's interested in soccer and basketball,
whatever. You just take those notes.

44
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,960
You know it's, I'm actually good before
you take some on over a situation,

45
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:49,470
if you already familiarize yourself
with this, you look at the,

46
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:53,130
maybe the HR website at your company has
a picture of everyone so you'll kind of

47
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,610
know who they are, gives you less
stuff to remember. So there's that

48
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,220
make good first impression.
Don't go in there looking like an idiot.

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,430
Don't go in there thinking that,
oh, I just, I'm the boss man.

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,930
So everyone has to bow down and,

51
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,960
and bow down to my superiority.
No,

52
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:18,190
they're actually mad at you. Right?
The, the thing is they're mad at you.

53
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:23,191
So I remember one time I was taken over
a small element and one of my friends

54
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,020
was a part of the element
and I went in like 20 guys.

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,930
I went in Hay and I walked in,

56
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,410
but I just had a notebook with like five
things I wanted to talk to them about.

57
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,850
And as soon as I walked in and I opened
up my notebook and he's said something

58
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:43,030
like, you brought a notebook,
you're always squared away.

59
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,620
That's why you're putting in charge.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,070
That's why your boots are so like just
a little impression of hey man, I'm,

61
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,020
I take this stuff seriously.

62
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,820
And I would say overall your main
goal when you're meeting your team,

63
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:59,440
when you're meeting the individuals on
your team is you are looking to build

64
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,530
relationships with the people on the team.
That's what your goal is.

65
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:04,900
Because when you build these relationships
that's going to make your team

66
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,960
stronger, et cetera. Yeah.

67
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,980
Remember the time you were when you were
on Joe Rogan the first time when he was

68
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:16,060
like, Hey, you're the only one who's
ever brought a note pad and you're like,

69
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,450
just trying to be prepared to just try
and be prepared and it was good in case

70
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:22,530
there's anything, you know,
you hop, it comes up to you.

71
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,340
I want it to slip your mind.
Yeah. Yeah. That's funny. Uh,

72
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,770
and I'm trying to imagine
being a worker and you know,

73
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:33,820
when you get a new manager,
you know, whatever new boss,
um, you know, they come in.

74
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,060
Yeah. If there were, I like having the
individual meeting, I would, oh, dig it.

75
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:39,070
And then, but if they're like
taking notes, I'd be like, wait,

76
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,150
why aren't you taking notes? Like, well,

77
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:44,920
how are you going to use this against
me later as they like, hey man,

78
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:47,710
how's it going? How long have
you been here for? Oh, I've
been here for four years.

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,690
All cool. Do you, you married? Yeah.
Yeah, I got two kids. Oh, that's awesome.

80
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,750
That's awesome. How long have you been
married for? Oh, six years like that.

81
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,150
You're getting to know the person.
If I go in there and I go,

82
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,070
how long have you been here?
And you're like six years.

83
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,190
And I write them and
I say, ah, what? What?

84
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,490
What is your primary function here
at the team? You know what I mean?

85
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:09,520
If you just jump right into that.
We're not looking to build a relationship.

86
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:12,580
We're just looking to find out how I can
use you. Yeah, that's what it feels like.

87
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,890
I mean, you said it like how long you've
been married. You said it like that.

88
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,390
No men, it doesn't matter how you
say, you can say it the most nice,

89
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,350
polite way ever. And when you write
it down, it's kind of like, Bro,

90
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:28,390
like you gonna take all this information
and sort of do some sort of evaluation

91
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:31,690
for me, you know, kind of is what it
feels like. It does feel like that.

92
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:35,150
That's why I specifically said when you're
having a personal conversation with a

93
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:36,640
person that you're meeting
for the first time,

94
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,380
you're not scratching it into a note pad.
Now, that being said, if the guy says,

95
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,990
you know what, I've noticed some things
here around here that need changing.

96
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,880
You go,
really hold on a second.

97
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,390
Let me break out my notebook here and take
the notes on what you're about to say.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,060
Yeah, that's, that's you know, if it's
like when you get a micro manager,

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,180
you're working for a micromanager,
bring a notebook.

100
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,920
They see you writing stuff down.
They think it's they they're like happy.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah. Trick anyone. Yeah cause well cause
when you're writing down their stuff,

102
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,120
yeah that flips the screen. It's like
it makes it like all, yeah. Yeah.

103
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:06,860
He's taking notes.
It's important what I'm saying.

104
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,820
Like he's can evaluate like my
opinion of what Ha Yeah. That's good.

105
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,910
Roll in there with a notebook.
It's like the doctor,

106
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,130
you know when you go to the doctor
and he's asking you, oh yeah,

107
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:17,990
like all this stuff. You see
him writing down, you know,

108
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,610
and your chart or whatever.

109
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,120
Even though doctors situation is good
cause you want them to go evaluate it

110
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,270
later whenever you don't give you a
cure. But same deal man, same deal.

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,070
Be careful with those notes
and my sake to check echoes.

112
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,610
Not Prepared for you to take notes on
them. We're not with personal stuff.

113
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,430
How long have you been married?
Oh, nine years old kid. Nine years.

114
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,010
Anyway, you understand? Next
question. Next question.

115
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm a sergeant and I want to know how
to deal with my men in a way without

116
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,730
punishment but still make
them better for next time.

117
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,230
Here's something for you.

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Punishment is actually the last straw in
how you deal with people that you're in

119
00:06:59,881 --> 00:07:02,340
charge of. In fact, I will tell you this,

120
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:08,030
if I ever had to punish someone when
I had to administer punishment on my

121
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,630
troops, I always felt that I had somewhere
I had, I had done something wrong,

122
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,520
right? Like, even if a guy got in
trouble out in town, got drunk,

123
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,280
got in a fight,
did something stupid,

124
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,620
I would still look at
that and think to myself,

125
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:27,621
how could I have allowed this guy to
not realize what a disaster it is,

126
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,550
how much trouble he's going to get in,

127
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,980
what kind of international
incident he's going to cause,

128
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:34,740
how that's going to hurt us in the
team strategically. All those things.

129
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,790
How did I let that happen?

130
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,920
So doling out punishment is not optimal.
I mean,

131
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,240
you've pretty much,

132
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,840
you've pretty much made a mistake if you
have to punish people because if you're

133
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,170
doing, if you're being a good leader,
people are doing what you want them to do.

134
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
There's no reason for punishment.
Hmm.

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,480
So that's what you should not be looking
to punish. And just like I just said,

136
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:57,150
you should be looking
to build relationships.

137
00:07:57,151 --> 00:08:01,620
You should be looking to show
people a better way of doing things,

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,360
a way that's more smooth
and more efficient and
doesn't disrupt what the team

139
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,740
efforts are. You got to explain to people
why they're doing what they're doing.

140
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:15,060
This is all stuff, right? This is explain
why things are done a certain way.

141
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,920
Explain how it impacts the team.
Explain how it impacts them.

142
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,370
That's also important.
Um,

143
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,910
you got to have people
rehearse in and retrain.

144
00:08:30,481 --> 00:08:30,860
Cause now what?

145
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,200
Now I'm talking about how do you get
people to do the right thing, right?

146
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,420
Without punishing them.
So we're trying to avoid punishment.

147
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:37,920
How do we avoid punishment by training?

148
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,650
How do we avoid punishment by people
understanding what they're doing,

149
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:41,610
why they're doing what they're doing?

150
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,770
How do we avoid punishment by
setting goals that make sense,

151
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:48,780
that are small enough for them to get to

152
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,790
and then have fun with the goals and get
in the game yourself and show them that

153
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,750
you're not perfect

154
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,390
and that is what you need to do.

155
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:05,391
You need to make every effort to make
people understand why they're doing what

156
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:09,810
they're doing,
how they fit into the big picture.

157
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,050
And when they figure all that
stuff out and they're on board,

158
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,730
you shouldn't have to punish people.
You shouldn't have to punish people.

159
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,520
So I know it's, yeah, that's what it is.

160
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,130
If you're a sergeant and you want to deal
with your men away without punishment,

161
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,400
well think of what the mistakes you're
making when you're, when you're,

162
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,480
when you're fire team or your,
your,

163
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,400
your platoon does something wrong.

164
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,260
Why did they make that mistake
that they make the mistake?

165
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,093
Because they wanted to.

166
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,850
Now they made it because you were a
bad leader at that point in time. You,

167
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:46,500
what could you do better? Hey guys,
where, what didn't you understand? Oh,

168
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,680
you guys messed up this
training operation.

169
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,690
I'm going to restrict your weekend duty.

170
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm going to restrict you to weekend duty.
Meaning you can't go out in town.

171
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,810
What good did I just do? Right?
Are they going to try harder now?

172
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,920
Right? Yeah. But if you say, hey,
listen guys, we did a bad job.

173
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,350
I know I must have made
a mistake in trying to

174
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,170
explain this information to you all
because we didn't do what we were supposed

175
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,740
to do. Let's look. Let's dissect
this thing. As a matter of fact,

176
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,600
let's spend Friday night
dissecting this thing.

177
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,300
I'm buying pizza and we'll
sit around the the uh,

178
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,040
sand table and we'll figure out what,
what we did wrong.

179
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,540
That's not punishment.

180
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,130
That has the opposite effect
of punishment that has, hey,

181
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,520
I'm bringing everyone in cause I
want to win. I want us all the wind.

182
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,460
So that's what you gotta do.
Don't punishment should be punishment.

183
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:44,940
Should be, I mean, do you have to
punish people sometime? Yes. Yes you do.

184
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,570
When they're blatantly out align, when
they do something that's blatantly wrong,

185
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,230
yeah, you gotta drop the hammer on them.
You've got to set the example sometimes,

186
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,640
hey,
you're not going to get away with this.

187
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,830
Sometimes that happened in the dreams,
you know,

188
00:10:55,831 --> 00:11:00,831
somebody would do something stupid and
the command would just drop the hammer

189
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,040
and everyone goes, man, that guy
got a Dui and they, you know,

190
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,830
docked him, dig, dig,

191
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,310
busted him in rank and they pulled him
out of his platoon and they're sending

192
00:11:11,311 --> 00:11:15,120
him to a, to a fleet billet for
two years. But Room, my God,

193
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,230
I'm going to make someone think right.
Maybe I won't step behind the wheel.

194
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,760
So sometimes you do have to punish
if people do something stupid,

195
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:27,270
especially after they've been warned
a couple of times. But I always look,

196
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:30,870
if I have to deliver
punishment onto my team,

197
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,210
I made a mistake somewhere.
I don't like it.

198
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,920
Don't they say that like
reward and encouragement is
like way more powerful than

199
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,710
punish? Definitely women. A
powerful way more powerful for sure.

200
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,560
I almost never punished people.
Yeah,

201
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,650
but the reason is why did I punish people?

202
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:52,500
Because people were doing
weren't doing stupid things.

203
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:56,560
They were doing what they were supposed
to be doing. They were doing. Yeah.

204
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,960
I mean I probably, I don't
even know if I, I probably,

205
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,500
I think I had like a one or two captain's
mast where I had to bring somebody in

206
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:06,430
and drop the hammer on them
and it's because they did
dumb stuff. It's like, Eh,

207
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:11,020
you know what? You can't do that.
I didn't think of it. I'm sorry,

208
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,540
but you can't do that discussions. Yeah.

209
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,250
Next question, Jocko. In the
discipline equals freedom field manual.

210
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,320
The section fear reads,

211
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,570
how do you overcome feel
fear of failure step go,

212
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,110
but a previous entry reads,

213
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,360
I don't want you to overcome
fear of failure. I want you
to be afraid of failure.

214
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,100
Mind elaborating. Yeah, clearly
there's a dichotomy here.

215
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,880
I know it's my favorite word apparently
according to Dean lister. Yes, I agree.

216
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,090
There is a dichotomy here because fear
is something good that you should take

217
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:52,630
advantage of.

218
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,630
So it's kind of good to be afraid
because it keeps you on edge edge.

219
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:56,950
It keeps you from slacking.

220
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:02,890
It keeps you preparing as much as you
possibly can and all that stuff is good,

221
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:06,790
but at the same time, yes, if you go too
far to the other end of the spectrum,

222
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,010
fear gets a hold of you
and you can't overcome it,

223
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:12,430
so you freeze or you cower or you run
away and none of those are good reactions.

224
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,050
So what I obviously failed to
communicate well in the book,

225
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:22,051
discipline equals freedom field manual
is the dichotomy between these spectrum,

226
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:28,600
the spectrum of fear that you can have.
So if you have no fear whatsoever,

227
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,020
no fear. Well guess what? You get
cocky. You can get arrogant. Um,

228
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,330
if you have too much fear, you can't even
get out of the gate. You just freeze.

229
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,650
You hesitate. So like all dichotomies,
you got to balance those two.

230
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,193
And

231
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,900
the way you balance those two is to try
and do things that make you feel fear.

232
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:50,680
Right?

233
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:55,480
Try and do things that make you feel
fear so that way you get used to it.

234
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,440
You can overcome it, you can
deal with it, you can utilize it.

235
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,790
If you have a fighter,

236
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,790
you ever hear UFC fighters that I'll
come afraid every time I get in the ring.

237
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,280
Right? Pretty much everybody. Yeah. Pretty
much everybody I'm afraid. Cause you're,

238
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,280
you're afraid, you're gonna get
knocked out. You're afraid this,

239
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,240
you're afraid that afraid I'm to lose in
front of all my family and friends and

240
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:14,290
all that.
So everyone's afraid.

241
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,200
So what does that fear do and drives you
to train harder? Drives you prepared,

242
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,500
drives you to keep your hands up and
your chin down when you're in the cage.

243
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,230
So yeah, there's a healthy
level of fear. It can also get,

244
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,880
get the best of you. So
keep it balanced. Yeah.

245
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,630
We will talk about this and I think Sam
Harris talked about it for as far as the

246
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:38,090
first, I heard it and made a
point not to go too deep into it,

247
00:14:38,091 --> 00:14:42,760
but they were, you know,
like this. Okay. Fear. Uh,

248
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,300
how do you overcome fear step go. Right.
It's essentially like take action,

249
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:51,010
be brave in the face of fear.
Right? But if there's no
fear, it's kind of like, hmm,

250
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,190
you're not really being brave.

251
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,510
You're not, you know, kind of
thing. Well that's true too. Yeah.

252
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:57,710
So could consider that, that
notion, right? So you say, yeah,

253
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:00,140
I want you to be afraid of failure.
Oh yeah. Be Afraid of failure,

254
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,260
but you still got to step. You still
got to go. He's still got to be brief,

255
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,850
you know, kind of thing.
So they do actually kind of
compliment each other. Really.

256
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,630
Um, unless you think like, oh
yeah. Overcome fear, meaning like,

257
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,840
I'm not scared of it anymore.
It's literally not figured
that it's always fear,

258
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,980
but it's more,
it's less about the fear being,

259
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,360
you know, it reduced to zero.
It's more about being brave,

260
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:26,250
training yourself to be embraced here.
Embrace the fear and the,

261
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,540
and so to continue with that thought,
in order to embrace the fear,

262
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:34,980
what do you do? You step, you
go into it. So there you go.
There's your answer. Cool.

263
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,210
Next question.

264
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,040
I was wondering when does standing up
for the right thing take precedence over

265
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,270
avoiding conflict?

266
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,570
This is something that leaders
have to deal with all the time.

267
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,340
So clearly out of the gate, things that
are immoral or unethical or illegal.

268
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,630
If you participate, you're
guilty. That's the way it is. Now.

269
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,060
Things that are a matter of opinion,

270
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,430
that's where you might have to play
the long game. Like maybe you won't,

271
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,180
don't want to do something a certain
way and if you, but if you think, oh,

272
00:16:07,181 --> 00:16:08,830
well,
uh,

273
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,890
I think the Jujitsu class warmups
should be doing these exercises and echo

274
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:19,540
thinks it should be those exercises.
So echo these things.

275
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,570
We should do it this way. No, we should
do it this way. Do you dig in? I dig in.

276
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,750
Now we, we just end up saying, well, I'm
not going to teach the class. You know,

277
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,570
you end up in these situations.
Well, what's the big deal? What's,

278
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,650
you know what I'd rather do? I'd rather
play the long game. I'd rather say,

279
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,800
hey man, can you explain why you do those
exercises? Oh, here's another exercise.

280
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:38,140
Cool. And that I learned isn't
as good for this technique. Oh,

281
00:16:38,141 --> 00:16:40,840
you know how you like when I do this move,
this actually helps me do it.

282
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:42,640
Even though it's just a warm
up move. Oh, that's cool.

283
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,750
We build a little relationship. You get
to understand me. I get to understand you.

284
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,300
Boom. Gelson you say, Hey, I'm going
to incorporate that into our warm ups.

285
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:52,900
We're going to warm up here.
Boom. There you go. Down.

286
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,470
I understand that that's the right
thing, right? Because in my mind,

287
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,830
I ma in my mind I'm thinking,
Hey,

288
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,850
these students need to know this escape
is the right thing to do. So I do that. So

289
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,150
you have to weigh it out. What am I doing
to my relationship in this situation?

290
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,190
If I go along with this,

291
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,080
like if you asked me to do nine things
that are pretty menial and you're my boss

292
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,850
and I said, Yep, cool, got
it, Boston, no problem,

293
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,730
and then you asked me to do something
else as meal. Yep. Cool. Got It, boss.

294
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:21,040
No problem. Then you asked
me to do something else.
Menial. Cool. Got It, boss.

295
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:21,620
No problem.

296
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,670
Then you asked me to do something that's
downright stupid and dangerous and I go,

297
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:27,040
hey boss, I need to talk
about this. I'm not sure.

298
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,480
Can you explain to me why
we're doing it this way?

299
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,120
Because there's a possibility that someone
could really get hurt and you go all,

300
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,890
well, you've done your, in your mind,

301
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:34,570
you're thinking you've done
these 10 things for me,

302
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,090
you've done nine things from your
dump, seven things from, you didn't,

303
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:39,640
well you didn't question me and now
all of a sudden you have a question,

304
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,760
you must have a legitimate question.
That's what we're hoping for.

305
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:47,650
That's why we're trying to build
relationships now. All that being said,

306
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,640
yes, we're playing the
long game. There are times,

307
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,880
and this is a really
sketchy area to enter into.

308
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,990
There are times where something
that is happening, is it immoral,

309
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,850
unethical or illegal,

310
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,570
and you might actually have
to kind of go along with it.

311
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,440
I tried to think of a good example
of that and I thought of one

312
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,920
Oscar Schindler from Schindler's list.
What did this guy do?

313
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,930
Right? This guy was a Nazi. He was a Nazi.

314
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,130
They were exterminating Jews and
instead of him standing up and saying,

315
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,190
this is wrong to exterminate Jews,
I protest.

316
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,570
How long would he have lived if he had
done that? 30 seconds right there. Oh you,

317
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,300
oh, you don't think Jews should dicho
we're killing you. That was that.

318
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,510
How many people did he save?
Zero. In fact, he, he costs,

319
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,830
he went negative one negative. What
did he do? He played the game. He,

320
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,150
he befriended the Nazi leadership.
He bought them gifts, he bribed him,

321
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,370
he bought him gifts,
he built relationships with them.

322
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:55,290
He ended up being able to move his
factory and all this other stuff to save a

323
00:18:55,291 --> 00:19:00,120
bunch of Jewish people.
And he,

324
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,840
even though he knew like he would,
he would see them executing people,

325
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,160
he would see them executing
Jews and he knew it was wrong.

326
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,140
He thought it was wrong.
He felt it was wrong.

327
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,370
And if he would have stood up and
said, hey, what you're doing is wrong,

328
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,190
then he wouldn't have been able to save
anyone. He would've been killed himself.

329
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,540
So even in that situation,
it's,

330
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,590
it's not a guarantee that you,

331
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,620
you need to stand up to do the ethical
thing because perhaps there's a chance

332
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:37,800
you can do the more ethical
thing by playing the game,

333
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,610
building relationships. Who knows?
Who knows? Maybe if that war went on,

334
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:43,080
maybe he would've said, oh, you know what,

335
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,660
he maybe he would have risen to
a position where he, you know,

336
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,240
maybe if the Germans would have won and
he could have said, hey, you know what,

337
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,670
the Jewish people are making
good workers here. I'm going to,

338
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,590
I'm going to continue to use
them, or whatever. You know,

339
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,870
maybe he built up a whole new,
you never know.

340
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,010
But when you get rid of your influence,

341
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,720
when you lose your influence because you
stand up, it might not be the best move.

342
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,720
And the thing that you
have to wait for this,

343
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,050
you have to wait with this is you are
participating. And actually, you know,

344
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,670
they say Oscar Schindler felt completely
guilty because he did participate and

345
00:20:16,671 --> 00:20:19,800
he was a part of,
of what was happening.

346
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,110
And he did his best to
stop as much as he could,

347
00:20:22,111 --> 00:20:24,390
but he wished he would have stopped more.
And you know,

348
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:27,630
at some point maybe you see a little
six year old girl getting shot and you

349
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:30,660
think, you know what? I should screw it.

350
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,310
I should stand in front of that bullet
and take that bullet for that little girl.

351
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,800
You know?
That's the kind of guilt that he felt.

352
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,220
So there are times where you
really have to weigh this out.

353
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,390
And also I'll tell you,

354
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,360
I mean even in things that
aren't this big ethical dilemma,

355
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,990
head on conflict is generally not
the best way to solve problems.

356
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:01,670
Most of the time it's much smarter to
maneuver and it's much smarter to flank.

357
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:06,180
And it's much smarter to come from another
angle and it's much smarter to build

358
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,660
allegiance and alliance with people so
you can have influence over so you can

359
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:15,840
move them in the right
direction. Yes. So almost like,

360
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,970
well actually straight up where doing
the right thing and avoiding conflict is

361
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:25,830
kind of like, they're not that like
opposite, you know, were doing,

362
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:27,690
they're avoiding.
You should,

363
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:30,930
and I'm totally just interpreting this,

364
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,220
trying to anyway of wedding conflict,

365
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:37,350
you should always be essentially trying
to avoid comp conflict as far as maybe

366
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,410
not always,
but generally speaking,

367
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,680
we do a better job then the outcome
is better when we avoid conflict.

368
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,130
Now of course, anyone listening to this,
thanks. Oh, you take that to extreme.

369
00:21:50,131 --> 00:21:53,340
This is someone that never stands up for
anything. Yeah. You know, and that's bad.

370
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,590
That's all. That's also bad from
a leadership perspective. If,

371
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,850
if your team is looking at you and they
think, hey, Jocko never sticks up for us.

372
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,610
He never gives the boss any push back.
So we just,

373
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:06,810
we're just at the whim of this tyrannical
boss and jock was no buffer to it.

374
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,860
That's what they see. So you can't just
be a pushover, but at the same time,

375
00:22:10,861 --> 00:22:13,940
if you go to your troops and you say,
Hey, listen guys, here's what's going on.

376
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,940
The boss has got a lot of ideas right now.
Some of them are good,

377
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,080
some of them not so good,
but guess what, what,

378
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,520
what I'm doing right now and the reason
that we're pushing hard to carry out

379
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:26,460
what he's trying to get us to do is the,
to the best of our ability.

380
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,130
The reason we're doing that is because
I'm actually trying to build some trust

381
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:32,670
with him so that he will
listen to me right now. He's
not really listening to me.

382
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,500
He knows I don't have much experience,

383
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,960
but I'm trying to build
relationships so he can listen to me.

384
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:39,690
So we can actually do this and what
I think is going to be a smarter way.

385
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,550
Can you guys help me build
this relationship by kicking
ass for the next three

386
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:48,750
projects that we've got so I can build
up some clout and come back to him and

387
00:22:48,751 --> 00:22:52,220
get the tools or the people,
whatever it is that we need. Yeah.

388
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,490
You always have this real
finesse sort of way of,

389
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,570
of saying stuff like you
wear it I guess who you were,

390
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,780
you were saying,
and I think you were wrong actually.

391
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,900
You were saying that that um,

392
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:15,500
standing up and doing the right
thing is this same thing as

393
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,020
avoiding home as avoiding conflict.
Yeah, no, I didn't mean it like that.

394
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,810
I meant that they're not necessarily
always opposite, you know,

395
00:23:25,811 --> 00:23:28,380
like doing the right thing in avoiding
conflict like there, you know,

396
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,870
there's just some wishy washy kind of
room wiggle room in there a lot of times.

397
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,840
And when I say avoiding, you should
always be quote unquote avoiding conflict.

398
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,550
I meant, of course, not always,

399
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:40,600
but I meant more like even if I'm going
to confront someone or something about

400
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:43,630
like something that's wrong,
I still should be while I do that,

401
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,040
I should be avoiding conflict for sure.

402
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:50,630
Do it in a finesse sort of way to actually
just keep everything rolling forward.

403
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,170
We've just nudge it in a different
direction kind of thing. But I actually,

404
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:57,680
now that I'm sort of reading this again,
I understand what he's asking. You know,

405
00:23:57,681 --> 00:24:00,830
it's like is there a time where it's
like, hey, there's gonna be conflict.

406
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,380
Is there a time where it's worth the
conflict to? And where is that point?

407
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,950
Did I always give? Is if you're telling
me, hey Jocko, go do the mission this way.

408
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,690
And I'm like, you know what? I'm not doing
it. And you go, okay, fine, you're fired.

409
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,250
And now is do you put someone some yes
man in my place and then that yes man

410
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,410
gets everyone killed.
Cause it was a stupid stupid plan.

411
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,840
Did I really help or should I have said,
hey boss,

412
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:25,610
I'm really going to recommend
we do it a different way.

413
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:28,160
Here's some different options.
And then finally you say, no doc,

414
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:29,240
are you doing it my way?
And guess what?

415
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,450
Even then I can go out and mitigate
in the field. Even then I can say,

416
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:37,070
you know what? And the classic example
of that is in band of brothers,

417
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,360
when Dick Winters of awesome leader,

418
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,500
they send a recon mission across
the river. One night someone dies.

419
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,050
They come back,
the war's over,

420
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:51,440
it's all but over and the next night
they wanted to do another reconnaissance

421
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:54,260
mission and Dick winters is like, sir, I'm
not sure. That's a great idea. He's like,

422
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:57,320
do it. He goes, okay Roger,
that the guys go down,

423
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,620
they'd drink a couple bottles
of wine in the bottom of them.

424
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,010
They don't do the mission.

425
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,110
He mitigated the risk if he would
have stood up and you know that's the,

426
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,070
that's a great example of where he
avoided conflict. He stayed in the game.

427
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:14,840
He wasn't he, she said yes, yes sir. Got
It. We got it. And then he did disobeyed.

428
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,890
Sure.
He put his,

429
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,070
he put his rank at risk and probably
could have gotten in some trouble,

430
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:20,570
but he knew it was the right thing to do.
Yeah.

431
00:25:20,571 --> 00:25:25,571
That was like the best sort of
way to do [inaudible] again,

432
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,433
you,
um,

433
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,630
you're always thinking of like the long
game versus the short game, you know,

434
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,150
where it's like, man, if you
can keep that in perspective,

435
00:25:35,151 --> 00:25:38,240
these things be become a little bit
more clear, you know, they always do.

436
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,750
Yes sir. All right, next question, Jocko.

437
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:46,670
I recently interviewed for a team lead
job but wasn't selected because I don't

438
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:51,440
have leadership experience. How can
I lead when I'm not in charge? Well,

439
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:54,740
you're in charge of something years,
certainly in charge of something.

440
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:57,890
You're in charge of some piece of gear.
You're in charge of some task.

441
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,190
You're in charge of maybe a couple people
here or there, but even if you're not,

442
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:04,670
you're in charge of something. So whatever
you're in charge of, take charge of it.

443
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,530
Take charge of whatever your task is.
You take charge of it, you own it.

444
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:12,050
You do it to perfection. Then once
you've got that completely dialed,

445
00:26:12,051 --> 00:26:12,531
then you know what?

446
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:17,270
You reach out and you see who else you
can help you help with other tasks.

447
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,410
You look for work. If you look for
work, you're going to find it right?

448
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,180
You're gonna find it.
You're going to find it.

449
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,220
You're going to start taking
things from other people. Now,

450
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:29,270
what you have to be careful of is
that you don't step on toes, right?

451
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,510
Because just about everyone
thinking about this,

452
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:37,030
just about everyone is offended by someone
that wants to be in charge. Hey y'all,

453
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,480
let me, let me, let me
take charge of this year.

454
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:43,060
That right there makes people cringe
to take lead on this. You know what?

455
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,100
Hey listen up guys. Right? If you're
that guy, and then everyone goes,

456
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,820
now there's a key point. This, this
is beautiful. This is beautiful.

457
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,310
So let's say we're in a platoon,
there's something going on, um,

458
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,790
in a mid grade position
and I realize like,

459
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,910
I want to be leader right now. If
I just go in and goes, hey guys,

460
00:27:02,911 --> 00:27:05,160
let me run this next mission. People
are like, dude, what are you doing?

461
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,890
What are you talking about? You don't
know anything. Hmm, okay. And they,

462
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,890
and they're kind of dug in against
me by the way. At that point,

463
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,000
if I give it enough,
I let things escalate a little bit.

464
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,420
What I would usually do is I would,

465
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,450
I would let things escalate to a
point to where when I took charge,

466
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:28,500
people were waiting for it and
they were happy that I took charge.

467
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,110
Even when I was even,
I was to ask you to come in,

468
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,340
like if you're a tasking to commander,
okay,

469
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:33,900
so I got Lafe and stone
are working for me.

470
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,330
I'm tasking you to commander
were out on an operation.

471
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,450
Something starts going wrong,
right?

472
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,970
Let's say life's doing a building
clearance with his platoon.

473
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,940
Something starts going wrong. I jumped
down there and say, all right guys,

474
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,860
push over that way. Start clearing
that hallway. How does lay feel?

475
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,210
Kinda phased.

476
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,230
He feels like I jumped down
and micromanage his platoon
and why are you doing

477
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:59,040
this? Everything was going
fine, so I don't want to do
that. I want, first of all,

478
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:03,180
I want him to work things out. Of course.
So what? Let's say, same things happening,

479
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,410
things are going a little bit bad.

480
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,280
They're starting to be a little bit of
confusion. Just starting to be escalated.

481
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:11,730
Voices. They're starting to be, you know,
hey, wait, wait, no, don't go there.

482
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,740
You can hear it. It's really
obvious when things are going wrong.

483
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,990
I might let that escalate a little bit.

484
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,710
Let it get to a point where life knows he
doesn't have control. This anymore. Now,

485
00:28:20,711 --> 00:28:24,540
like I'm down and go, hey, everyone, lock
it up. You four, hold on that hallway.

486
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,220
You to start clearing that back room.

487
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,020
Everyone else gets to the
rooftop and hold security.

488
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,390
You know what everyone thinks,
including life. They go, Hah,

489
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,730
thank God that just happened right now,

490
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,490
and that can happen from anywhere
in the chain of command. I'm happy.

491
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,160
I happen to be given an example of
when I was the task and the commander,

492
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:42,360
but I would do the same thing
when I was an e five which is, oh,

493
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,740
things are going a little bit sideways.

494
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,760
No one wants to hear the guy
that as soon as the opportunity,

495
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:51,870
as soon as there's any void of leadership,

496
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,860
you just like jumping in. They're like,
okay guys, Captain America to the rescue,

497
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,380
right? You don't want to do
that. You want to let that voice.

498
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,250
I'll tell you what happens if there's a
little tiny void that you try and jump

499
00:29:02,251 --> 00:29:04,600
into, guess what you're gonna do. You're
gonna bump into everyone else. That's,

500
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,130
that's in that void. It has to
meet an actual void of leadership.

501
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,710
Once that actual void of leadership
opens up and it's big enough,

502
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,120
you jump in there and you,

503
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,540
and because you've detached because you
are detached because you're watching it

504
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:22,410
happen, you jump in there and you have
so much confidence in what you're saying.

505
00:29:22,411 --> 00:29:24,360
You have so much understanding
of the situation.

506
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:27,480
You look like a genius and everyone's
happy that you just did that.

507
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,740
And by the way, as soon as that
problem gets solved, you step back out.

508
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:34,620
The leadership void is closed up by
someone else and you're good to go.

509
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,190
And next time people,

510
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:40,230
people will not be surprised at all when
something goes wrong and you step in

511
00:29:40,231 --> 00:29:43,060
and you've solved the problem.
So that's what you should do.

512
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,910
You yes you want to be in charge
of, yes, you should look for work,

513
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:49,480
but you can't step on toes.
Don't jump in every time.

514
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:54,100
Chance you get like Captain America, I'm
going to save the day. No, you're not.

515
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:58,420
Let there be a real problem.
Assess it from the outside.

516
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,220
And like I said, you've got to be
careful about being captain America.

517
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,780
You gotta be careful about being,

518
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:08,770
I'm going to say I'm ready to stand up
every moment and that that's a problem.

519
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,770
You know it's a problem when someone,
when someone's goal,

520
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,510
this is going to sound weird.

521
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,290
When someone's goal is
to be a leader like my,

522
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,570
to be a leader, like if that's what
they're thinking, that's gonna,

523
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,690
that's gonna offend people.
It's going to offend people because,

524
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,060
and I'll tell you why it
offends people to rightfully so.

525
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:31,320
You know why it offends people
because what is it about themselves?

526
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,160
It's about me. I want to be a
leader. I me, me want to lead.

527
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,000
That's what it's about.

528
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:41,410
And everyone recognize that if what you
really want to do is you want the team

529
00:30:41,411 --> 00:30:45,340
to win and you realize that sometimes
you're going to be in a supporting role

530
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:49,570
and sometimes there might be in a
situation where you need to lead almost

531
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,540
hesitantly. You know what?
Leadership needs to happen.

532
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,320
I'll go make it happen because the team
needs it to win. I'm here for the team,

533
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,310
so don't be the person about yourself.
We don't like that person.

534
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,630
I don't even like that person.

535
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,910
As much as I love people that
want to step up and lead,

536
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:07,480
I don't want that person that's
like looking for themselves.

537
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,010
Sometimes you gotta be following, I
want someone that's like, Hey, oh cool,

538
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,170
I got your back. Don't worry
about it. I'm over here.

539
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,440
I'm over here a part of the
train. I'm over here cleaning
rooms. Oh wait a second.

540
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:20,620
There's a leadership void, and now
there's an actual problem going on. Oh,

541
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:22,540
and then that person suddenly
steps up and solves a problem.

542
00:31:22,541 --> 00:31:25,390
Then it goes right back down
to their level. Awesome.

543
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,440
That's the person you want and that's
the person you want to be. Yeah.

544
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,690
Yeah. You know, like nowadays,

545
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,460
the lie I hear a lot nowadays
where they add value to add value.

546
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,630
So that's essentially what you're doing.
If you're not,

547
00:31:35,631 --> 00:31:39,130
I'll at least of situation,
it's like boom, I'm going
to add value. So one, okay,

548
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:41,020
if we want to start with my own role,
you know,

549
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,880
that's where I'm gonna add
the most value of my own role.

550
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:48,180
But if there's little voids in whatever
capacity that needs some value added,

551
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:51,790
I'm going to go ahead and add that value.

552
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,550
We can't just be piling on
the value or it's not needed.

553
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,800
Don't pour it additional value. No Man to
non-value needing areas. Exactly right.

554
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:03,370
That's problematic and what you value.
That's true. All right, next question.

555
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,420
Hi Jocko.

556
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,350
When you're trying to take ownership of
a mistake made by a fellow team member,

557
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,710
what do you do if the team
leader asks for a step by step,

558
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,840
step by step breakdown of events.

559
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,200
I've said it was our
mistake and not to end,

560
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,270
not made excuses,

561
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,280
but a step by step breakdown would expose
the fact that he alone was responsible

562
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:25,114
for that error.

563
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,610
Interesting.
So he basically

564
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,270
it is, wait, wait. So He's, he's basically
saying, okay, it's our mistake, right?

565
00:32:33,271 --> 00:32:36,300
I don't want to individualize
this guy or assault, you know,

566
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,340
make him stand out or whatever.
Um,

567
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,100
it's our mistake and
we're going to fix it kind

568
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,410
of thing. And he's like, no, I want
the step by step and this step, step,

569
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:47,120
step by step is going to reveal,
reveal the Solo. Actually bill's fault.

570
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,800
And now what? I tried so hard to
take ownership, but here's the car.

571
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,610
It was actually build. It was
all jacked up. Actually not mine.

572
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,520
It's actually not my fault
is what we're saying.

573
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,990
It's it's the truth, right?
You get that right? Yeah.

574
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,520
Cause cause check it out.

575
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,290
Who's responsible leaders when you're
taking ownership for something,

576
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,050
when you're taking extreme ownership for
something, who's fault is it? Mine. Yeah.

577
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,100
Does that include when someone else
on your team makes a mistake? Yes.

578
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,710
But how can that be God's man?
It's here. It's your seam.

579
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,080
So let me ask you these questions
and here's what I'd be thinking. Um,

580
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,380
the teammate was in error.
Why?

581
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:35,450
Well, why did the teammate make a mistake?
Why didn't the teammate have backup?

582
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,670
Why didn't the rest of
the members of the team,

583
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:41,750
why didn't I actually go through with
him and make sure that he knew how to do

584
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:44,450
that procedure properly?
He's part of my team.

585
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,850
We are responsible for this taking place.

586
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,270
I knew he was a little bit shaky
and I didn't do anything to fix it.

587
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,560
That's why it's our fault. It's not our
fault because we say, oh, it's our fault,

588
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:57,860
but it's really bill. That's not,
that's not what we're talking about.

589
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,660
The point is, the point is to actually
own it. So if my coworker fails,

590
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,030
I'm literally saying to myself,

591
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:09,770
what mistake did I make that
my coworker dropped the ball?

592
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,360
What mistake did I make?
My coworker dropped the ball.

593
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,320
What mistake did I make?
Did I not show it to him?

594
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,390
Did I not ask him if he knew how to do it?

595
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,920
Did I not ask me if he needed some help?

596
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:24,380
Did I not confirm that he
knew the procedures correctly?

597
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,940
All those things are my fault.

598
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,920
Did I not do a good job of identifying
that bill was a little bit slow on the

599
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:35,000
uptake and therefore he needed a
little extra preparation for this

600
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,830
and now, now think about this. What can
I do once I make those mistakes? Okay,

601
00:34:39,831 --> 00:34:40,541
we're going to do to fix him.

602
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:44,330
And now think about this from a leadership
perspective. You go down and you say,

603
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:48,230
hey guys, you guys messed up this
thing a wider than it happened.

604
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,550
And now think about the team
where everyone goes, well,
you know it's our fault.

605
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,240
Mostly Bill,
right?

606
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,970
And I'll tell you when I,
when, when, when I look at, uh,

607
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,510
a platoon and bill made a mistake,
I don't look at bill.

608
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,000
A good leader doesn't just look at bill.

609
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,920
A good leadership looks
at everyone on the team,

610
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,270
especially certainly the leadership.

611
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:12,680
But I think this guy's
talking about from a peer,

612
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:17,270
but it doesn't matter from a
peer perspective. If there's
a mistake that happens,

613
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,370
we are truly responsible.

614
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,170
And then from a leadership perspective,
when I go down to the team and I say,

615
00:35:25,171 --> 00:35:27,740
hey guys, what happened? And they
said, well, it was our fault,

616
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,160
but this is what bill did. I go, okay,
so you just dropping dime on bill.

617
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:32,960
I'm not going to say that, but I'm
like, I'm thinking to myself, okay,

618
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,980
so it's all bills fall. Cool. I'll tell
you what. Whereas if you say, hey, listen,

619
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,710
bosses, what happened, here's
the procedures. We went,

620
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,870
I don't think we did a good
job of briefing bill cause
here's what bill did. He,

621
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,870
he did step three instead of step
for my fault. We went through twice.

622
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:51,120
But why should it gone through it a
couple more times and confirm he knew what

623
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:52,710
was going on.
It's not gonna happen again.

624
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:56,580
We got this which guy who you want
to work for, which guide you, which,

625
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,870
which team do you want?

626
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,050
You want the team where people are
taking ownership of the problem,

627
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:04,350
not blaming bill.
Ah,

628
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,210
ownership is not just saying we own it.

629
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,740
Ownership is actually owning it and
that's what makes it so powerful.

630
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,650
What makes it so powerful
is if you actually own it,

631
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:20,100
then you actually look at bill
beforehand and you go look in our team,

632
00:36:20,101 --> 00:36:22,050
do we have any weaknesses?
Yeah we do. We got bill.

633
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,080
Bill doesn't bill can't get this
part of the procedure done right?

634
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,140
Here's what we're gonna do. We're going
to put bill in his other position.

635
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:30,780
That's an easier part of the procedure
were to make sure he knows how to do that.

636
00:36:30,781 --> 00:36:31,231
Meanwhile,

637
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:34,720
we're taking Mike and Mike is going to
go down here and he nails this procedure

638
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:38,220
and, and he's going to spend, by the way,
an extra 15 minutes a day during lunch,

639
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,580
he's going to get bills trained up.
So bill can eventually,

640
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,750
that's the kind of thing
you'd do on a team. Yeah,

641
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,940
you made it pretty clear, which is, um,

642
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,050
which is kind of,

643
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,260
cause it's not that easy to
understand or it wasn't for me anyway,

644
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,390
I mean put it this way,
it was,

645
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,010
it was very valuable when I didn't
understand this about extreme ownership.

646
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,380
I said this before too,
by the way. So there's,

647
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,890
there's essentially two parts of it
that make it extreme ownership. Well,

648
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:07,740
actually there's three, there's the
dichotomy, but aside from the debt cloud,

649
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:08,574
I mean this is what it is.

650
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,820
You take responsibility and then you
say what you're going to do to fix the

651
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,840
puzzle.
And then actually there's a third part,

652
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:18,840
which is you implement the solution.
Yes, yes. Okay. You identify it,

653
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,410
you own the problem,
you identify a solution for the problem,

654
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:25,650
and then you implement the
solution. That's what you do. Yeah.

655
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,500
So a lot of times in the associate,
in the beginning, like I would just,

656
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,630
as far as me just kind of
casually trying to understand it,

657
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:34,200
I would focus so much on taking
responsibility, you know, it was my fault,

658
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,740
you know, kind of thing. It's like, well,

659
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,690
the taking responsibility,

660
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:44,691
I mean is arguably more important than
saying that it's your fault kind of

661
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,590
thing.
It's essentially you're,

662
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:50,550
you're taking responsibility of
the solution as well, if not you.

663
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:53,340
Because in a way,
in a lot of practical cases,

664
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,740
you don't even have to
identify who's fault it is.

665
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,270
If you take responsibility of the
solution. Like if a, if I'm okay here,

666
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,130
so if there's a football team, right,
that's like the epitome of team,

667
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,440
not the epitome,
but want a good example of teamwork.

668
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,390
Nevermind the seal teams or whatever.
But we'll go with it.

669
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:13,530
It'll be more simple because
it's a, so let's say, okay,

670
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:16,110
we've got a pass or
whatever, and boom, the play,

671
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:20,070
the play starts and a guy gets
through the frontline, uh,

672
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,540
let's say the guard missed
a block. Obvious, right?

673
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,680
You missed it. Maybe he looked one way
and it was supposed to look this way.

674
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,900
He was supposed to not pull
any tried to pull or something.

675
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:33,540
Maybe he just made a mistake. He just
made a mistake. He's not in company.

676
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:36,010
Just made a mistake. Whose
fault is it? The guards fall.

677
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,460
Okay. But if the quarterback's
gonna take extreme ownership,

678
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:42,520
he's going to be like, hey, no part
in the, hey this happened. You know,

679
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,150
next time we review, I'm going to remind
them, hey, on this play that play,

680
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:49,630
you know, this red 46 nope.
Curve twist or whatever.

681
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:54,150
Like you don't pull and he pro probably
be like on Matt. I know, I know it.

682
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:57,610
Don't go scold them. Just see like,
hey, you don't go, hey, no problem,

683
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,930
but we're just not going
to do that anymore.

684
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,440
And then next time I call that play
and be like, you're good. Right?

685
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm gonna check with them.

686
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,980
I didn't check with them that first time
you made a mistake in my check with him.

687
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:08,100
He won't make that mistake again.
Kind of like key when we're now we,

688
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,650
when we were driving navigated me, you
know, it's kind of one of those things.

689
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:16,000
The quarterback took responsibility for
solving the problem more so than he was

690
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:20,600
like, okay that was my fault and making
a big deal out of it being his fault. No,

691
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,830
in his head it is, you know, it's like,
okay this is my fault. I should, you know,

692
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,820
I should make sure things are clear
kind of thing. I think the weather too,

693
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,920
you know your,
whether it's,

694
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:33,130
well what bothers me the most
about this question is I feel like,

695
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:39,040
I feel like I don't do a
good job of explaining this
because what bums me out is

696
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:42,970
someone, whoever wrote this question and
it's a good question. I get the question,

697
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:47,720
I get scared that the person that's
listening to the question goes, now Jack,

698
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:48,820
who doesn't quite get it,

699
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:53,230
he doesn't quite get the fact that there
was this one guy who is part of the

700
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:58,180
team who made this mistake and no one,
you know,

701
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:02,140
we just, we can't hold his hand
every time. Like that's not my fault.

702
00:40:02,141 --> 00:40:06,820
It's not our team's fault.
When bill drop completely drops the ball.

703
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,410
That's not my fault.

704
00:40:08,411 --> 00:40:12,010
It's not anyone on the
team's fault and my point is,

705
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,780
is exactly what you are
saying. Echo. Yes it is,

706
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,580
and if you look at it,
when bill makes the mistake himself,

707
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,040
he's alone in a room and he's supposed to,

708
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:29,970
you know he's supposed to put part a on
top of part B and Bolt them together.

709
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:32,860
That's his part of the job.

710
00:40:32,861 --> 00:40:36,790
He's alone in a room doing that
and he doesn't do it right.

711
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,110
That's 100% his fault.

712
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,560
The answer is no actually who's
in charge of training him?

713
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:48,220
Who's in charge of checking, who not
even in charge of WHO's responsible.

714
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:51,640
We are a team.
That means we work together.

715
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,780
That means we confirm that we know how
to do our individual parts of the job.

716
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:59,140
That means we check and say, hey
bill, are you good? Hey Bill,

717
00:40:59,141 --> 00:41:01,870
let me check your first three that you
do to make sure you understand what's

718
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:06,640
happening. We do this together as a team
and it makes me feel like a failure,

719
00:41:06,641 --> 00:41:11,550
that people have a hard
time understanding this and,

720
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,890
and I know it's, it can be a stretch,
it can be a stretch. And you know,

721
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:18,430
I give all those examples,
hey, the machine gunner
shoots in the wrong direction.

722
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:19,930
Who's fault is that?
It's not the machine.

723
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,720
The machine gunner literally pointed
the machine gun in the wrong direction,

724
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,480
pulled the trigger and shot in the
wrong direction. Who's fault is it?

725
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,680
It's the squad leaders.
It's the fire team leaders.

726
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,050
It's the platoon leaders because they
didn't make sure that they understood his

727
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:34,040
field of fire. Make sure you
understood how to operate his weapon.

728
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,873
And by the way,

729
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,010
there's a chance that the reason that
bill screwed this up and bill is incapable

730
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,400
of putting these parts together correctly.
And if that is the situation,

731
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,510
guess what?

732
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:47,810
It is the responsibility of the team to
either get him trained up to where he

733
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:52,130
can't do it or to tell the leadership
that this guy cannot these incapable of

734
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:54,860
doing the job and therefore
he needs to not be here.

735
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:00,560
That's what ownership is.
That's what extreme ownership is.

736
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,090
I think I know what it is. What, what,

737
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:07,670
what makes it confusing or sometimes
kinda kind of slippery like to grasp,

738
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:11,090
you know,
cause it depends on who you ask.

739
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,240
So a lot of times the thing is when,
when it's the machine gun, his fault.

740
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,210
The thing is if I'm,
if I'm not even a human being,

741
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:21,380
I'm just the disembodied brain.
Okay.

742
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,800
It's the machine that is fun and the
leader's fault and that it's everyone's

743
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:28,340
fault if I'm dealing, you know, but,
but if you ask the individual person,

744
00:42:28,341 --> 00:42:30,580
cause you ask a machine
gunner, hey he, okay Jocko,

745
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:32,210
you're the machine gun and you
shot in the wrong direction.

746
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,450
And I asked you who's fault is that? What
are you going to say now? Leaders fault.

747
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,390
Well it's your fault. Well let
me, let me tell you right now,

748
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,550
there are plenty of people and definitely
plenty of machine gunners that when

749
00:42:43,551 --> 00:42:45,830
they shoot that weapon in the wrong
direction, you know what they say?

750
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,800
I didn't get a clear brief on what
the field of fired war. No one too.

751
00:42:48,801 --> 00:42:49,700
I didn't see the,

752
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,450
the markers for what the range limits
where I didn't know where the other blue

753
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,400
forces were.
No one told me.

754
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,190
So they're looking at it like
it actually isn't their fault.

755
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,920
Now you get some good Michigan
and actually guess what?

756
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,030
When you have a guy that's
a machine gunner that says,
well, it wasn't my fault,

757
00:43:05,031 --> 00:43:06,470
it was my leader's fault.
You know what the leader says?

758
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,780
You know what the leader says? Well, glues
or bad leader. The leader in this team,

759
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,430
the leader in this team,
you know what he says? No.

760
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:15,860
It was a machine gunner
swapped. Yeah, that's right.

761
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,960
And now guess who's fault it was?
It was no one's fault.

762
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,880
The machine gun and think
it's the bosses fault.

763
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:21,210
The boss thinks it was a
machine gunner his fault.

764
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,320
Now who's going to fix the problem?
The answer's no one knowing. Yeah.

765
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,050
When you get a good team,
the machine going to goes to my fault.

766
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,100
I should have paid better attention
to the leaders is my fault. I should.

767
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,190
And now you have everyone taking
ownership of the problems. Yes. Yeah.

768
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:36,650
That's the way it's supposed to be.
But that's my point.

769
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:38,130
And that's why it makes it so,
nevermind.

770
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,690
You're disembodied brain that's
making decisions over here.

771
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,370
I'm saying this is why it's
hard for people to understand.
That's why sometimes,

772
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:51,020
and I'm with them. I'm like, I was there.
It's Kinda like, it's Kinda like sure I'm,

773
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,690
and extreme ownership, you know, the
typical, I'm taking extreme ownership,

774
00:43:53,691 --> 00:43:56,690
but at the end of the day,
we all know as well bill's fault.

775
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:01,610
But the reason that it is so hard because
if I ask, okay, we have three guys,

776
00:44:01,611 --> 00:44:04,000
one of those guys as a machine gun and
the other guy's a leader, the other guys,

777
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,300
just another team member, uh, he's,
you know, he's the sniper or something.

778
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,420
If I say, Hey, this machine that
a shot in the wrong direction,

779
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:14,510
individual meetings, I, they
all take extreme ownership.

780
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,430
All of them are down there in the game.
All of them.

781
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:21,110
I asked you machine gunner, who's
fault is that? What's he going to say?

782
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,220
You're my fault. Okay, next guy who's
faulted fires you leader my fault.

783
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:28,580
I shouldn't squad leader my fault.
I should've told them, right? Yes.

784
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:33,210
So it the re now go back to
the disembodied brains. It's
kind of like, wait, wait,

785
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:36,210
wait, wait. So it's like he did it.

786
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,890
It's hard to grasp like that one guy,

787
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,670
it is his fault thing. It's
not just his fault, apparently,

788
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:48,480
because everyone said it's their fault.
Right. So he was obviously his fault,

789
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,950
but wait,
it's everyone's fault kind of thing.

790
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,120
So when you're the guy and you're
saying, okay, his fault it,

791
00:44:53,121 --> 00:44:56,130
that little thing creeps in your brain
that's like, yeah, wait, it is his fault.

792
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,110
Yeah. You know? Yeah.
Yeah. And you're wrong.

793
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,590
And I'd need to do a better job of
explaining that to people because I see

794
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:09,210
questions like this on a
fairly regular basis, which is,

795
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,590
but hey, really? You know, there's like,
Hey, I get ownership. But really? Yeah,

796
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,520
that's what it means to,

797
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:19,521
but really that you need to check your
cell phone because the reality is you're

798
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:24,450
responsible. Yeah. You
wait. If I'm responsible.

799
00:45:24,451 --> 00:45:27,810
What about the machine that he just
said he's responsible machine gunner.

800
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,110
You're a wasp. No, but the machine
going, I said he's responsible.

801
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,110
See what I'm saying? No, I think
that's the feeling that that jam,

802
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,810
if you let that creep in and
that's going to be a problem. Yeah.

803
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,510
Pray you ever seen office space?

804
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,770
So really when you think about,
okay, what's the big thing?

805
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,660
I think he has the movie. Remember you.
Okay, let me, let me remind you case.

806
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:50,940
So in the beginning they were like,
Hey Peter,

807
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,530
you were putting cover sheets on the tps
reports from Nala or we've been doing

808
00:45:55,531 --> 00:46:00,480
that. You forgot to do that. All right.
So first lumbered comes his boss,

809
00:46:00,481 --> 00:46:03,400
the first lumbered comes, he's like,
yeah, you know, saying, Hey, let me read.

810
00:46:03,401 --> 00:46:06,270
He didn't do it in a Dick Way and
knowing for sure, but he said, hey,

811
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:09,270
this is basically a reminder.
Did you get that memo?

812
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,500
We're putting cover sheets on
the tps roots part to say, Hey,

813
00:46:11,501 --> 00:46:15,780
I just forgot it was a one time thing, no
problem. And he's like, cool, all that,

814
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:19,740
you know. So if you just do that, do
that, that'd be cool. And he's like, cool,

815
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:22,350
no problem. You saw, I'll even
give you another copy of that memo.

816
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,500
He almost like over did it.
Not only was he did overdo it,

817
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:29,280
so he left and then the other boss boom,
who's like one level down, he came,

818
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:33,480
same deal. Hey, we're putting, did
you get that memo? TPS reports,

819
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:36,450
cover sheets now, blah, blah,
blah. He's like, I got the memo,

820
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:40,020
I forgot one time thing. It's like, yeah,
I'm just, all of those bosses were do,

821
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,860
doing is making sure the
problem got solved, right.

822
00:46:43,861 --> 00:46:47,250
Doing everything in their power. Even
his other, his friends were like, Hey,

823
00:46:47,251 --> 00:46:49,680
what's up? I heard you guys, you're
having problems with your tps.

824
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:53,100
So they were just taking
extreme ownership, taking
ownership of the problem,

825
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:56,700
trying to solve it, but we give
them crap about it. Who Do,

826
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,550
who do we give for the movie in
a movie somewhere? Yeah. Yeah,

827
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:02,490
because they're trying to make
it funny, Dude. I know, I know,

828
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:06,210
but that's kind of ironic, but yeah,
I know. But it's ironic, right? It is.

829
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,520
So I'm not even mad at Lemberg for that.
Let's see, next question. Hi Jocko.

830
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,770
I have a question for you.
I know you're very busy guy.

831
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:18,270
How do you find time to
read so many books? I have.

832
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:22,950
I have many that I want to read,
but I have trouble having enough time.

833
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,810
Any advice on how to set
aside time to do so? Uh, sure.

834
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:29,913
All right.
Lay It on me.

835
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,630
Make time.
What are you,

836
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:39,250
what are you doing all day?
The cock second.

837
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,230
What are you doing all day? Are you
watching TV? Are you surfing the Internet?

838
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,410
Are you watching youtube videos?
That's my question.

839
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:52,840
What are you doing before you go to sleep
at night? Are you looking at Twitter?

840
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,600
Are you looking at Instagram posts?

841
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,720
The Instagram videos tell me
they're not like an addiction.

842
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,340
You get the, you get the Instagram
video. Every one of them is funny there.

843
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,810
38 seconds on the one minute long.
Get to see people hurt themselves.

844
00:48:13,811 --> 00:48:17,770
Get to see people do dumb things and
make you feel good about yourself.

845
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,000
I didn't do that dumb thing and
someone else did. I can laugh at them.

846
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,450
How long are you going to look at those
videos for when you could be reading? So,

847
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:33,070
so there you go. Stop wasting a bunch of
time. And then what about audio books?

848
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,470
What do you, what are you doing
when you're mowing the lawn?

849
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,740
What are you doing when
you're trimming the hedges?

850
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,480
What are you doing when
you're pulling weeds?

851
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,180
What are you doing when you're cleaning
the dishes? Get some audio books.

852
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:47,650
Get some audio books. What are you
doing first thing in the morning?

853
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,900
What are you doing?
Are you waking up,

854
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,110
checking your email,

855
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,610
sitting around waiting, you
know, wasting a bunch of time?

856
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:03,280
Are you getting up early enough that
you could just get up, get out of bed,

857
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:07,210
go and read for 30 minutes,

858
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,670
30 minutes? That's what you have
to do. You have to make time.

859
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,470
There's plenty of time to read.
There's plenty of time to read it.

860
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,670
You probably don't want
to read as badly as your,

861
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,350
as you think. If you wanted to
read that bad, you'd make time.

862
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,640
You make time to breathe somehow.
You can make time to breathe.

863
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:33,950
You can make time to read. Yeah. I
wouldn't say it's the best. Yeah,

864
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:38,680
he would be a better one because
like, yeah, eat I think because read,

865
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:41,300
you can read while you're doing other
things sometimes, especially with just,

866
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,880
just kind of like as a,
as a, so I'm reading,

867
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,030
I'm always have to be reading a book
to read a book for the podcast. Right.

868
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:54,220
I had only read the first maybe 10 books
that we read that we did on the podcast.

869
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,190
We've done a hundred or something now.
Probably more than that.

870
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:00,370
I would only read like 10 of them
and maybe it may be a few more,

871
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,980
but I'd read them so long ago.
Maybe I'd read 30,

872
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,120
but some of them so long ago that just,
I had to reread them.

873
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,330
And so then you say to yourself,
okay,

874
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,260
so when would you know when I read all
the time or we'd go to bed and greeting,

875
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:19,160
wake up reading, um, uh,
going in an airplane. Oh,

876
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,540
see people, what are people doing?
An airplane sleep or watch a movie.

877
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,600
I know you sleep, they do all this
stuff. I sleep sometimes in an airplane,

878
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,680
but we're from not sleeping. Get
us. Guess what I'm doing? Reading,

879
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:29,900
prepping for a podcast. I
can attest to that. Yeah.

880
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:35,680
Uh, what do you think is the, like
the biggest ones that people are, um,

881
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:37,820
you know, that, you know, the, the biggest

882
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:43,470
activities that they could, yeah, they
could just stop and it just, uh, for me,

883
00:50:43,471 --> 00:50:47,130
I think the biggest time sucks.
Our Youtube.

884
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,870
I think Instagram.
Yeah.

885
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,890
I think those two are really, um, what's
the word? Stimulating to the brain.

886
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,670
And you actually get this weird
like, well, I actually like,

887
00:50:59,671 --> 00:51:01,560
I'm going to learn a little
something from this right here.

888
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,740
I'm gonna take something away from this.
I'm going to veg out.

889
00:51:04,741 --> 00:51:09,150
I'm going to escape
from my world right now.

890
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,740
It's like escapism, right?
Yeah. And, and they,

891
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:19,190
they actually have
algorithms that are stat,

892
00:51:19,231 --> 00:51:22,110
know what you will click on.

893
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,390
They actually know that about you.

894
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:29,750
They mapped your little brain and know
that if they put up a video that has,

895
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,440
if they put up a thumbnail of a video
and it's got a heavy machine gun in it,

896
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,970
they've, they know they got a good
chance. I'm going to click on it. Right.

897
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:47,010
And then they give it a catchphrase title,
right? Nope. They give it a catchphrase.

898
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:51,840
Title. Isis gets massacre.
I got to watch that.

899
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:57,090
Oh,
click 50 cal vs Taliban.

900
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:01,980
Oh, cool. Click over the
anything, right? Oh yeah, yeah.

901
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:06,360
And actually no words you're going
to click on. And that's, that's so,

902
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,500
and what do you get out of it?
You Watch it for 20 minutes.

903
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:15,330
You weren't game. Yeah. You get nothing
out of it. You get a book, you read,

904
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,120
you learn, you'll write
something. That's what you do.

905
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,730
Yeah. That, and actually
the youtube thing is,

906
00:52:20,731 --> 00:52:23,420
it's funny if that's one of your things,
it's worse than,

907
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:27,200
it's not just youtube who's trying
to get you to watch the video.

908
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:30,260
It's the video makers themselves.
So you do has the Algorithm, oh,

909
00:52:30,261 --> 00:52:33,740
they got it all kind of sorted out there.
And now the video makers,

910
00:52:33,741 --> 00:52:37,970
they make titles like 50 cal versus
Xyz and awful bunch of those too.

911
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,940
And guess what?
50 cal versus you can fill in the blank.

912
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:45,590
You're probably going to watch that video.
The main motivation speech ever. Yes.

913
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,250
They, oh yeah. So, so in,

914
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:53,251
so destroys whatever destroys
reporter in interview.

915
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,760
Exactly right. So once
you really owned the

916
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,990
floodings cause those are actual
things are actual. So basically we'll,

917
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,090
right when you log onto youtube, once
youtube pops up on your screen, Bro,

918
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,690
everyone on that screen is all
sucking your attention. Literally.

919
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:15,290
That's their job. Sucking your attention.
So yeah man, that's a big one, right?

920
00:53:15,291 --> 00:53:18,470
Instagram. So here's the,
here's the, here's one that
it really hit me really hard.

921
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,400
Graham Graham and I like Instagram.
It's like good.

922
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,130
But if you're trying to read,
you don't, if you want to read

923
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,260
more or whatever,
consider like even like,

924
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,240
let's say we start
recording just for a second,

925
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,710
we're going to look at
the bus on our phones.

926
00:53:31,711 --> 00:53:34,230
We're going maybe checking email
and maybe we got a text or whatever.

927
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:38,790
And the Cha, the probability of Instagram
coming up on there. We're going to,

928
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:43,230
you know, open it. But the probability
of US opening Instagram is,

929
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:47,100
it's pretty significant. It's pretty
high. And you can scroll through there,

930
00:53:47,101 --> 00:53:50,070
whatever. Even if you school
for two, three minutes, right?

931
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,500
You scroll through there and maybe you,
what you looked at a, I don't know,

932
00:53:52,501 --> 00:53:55,890
1520 people's posts,
read what they had to say.

933
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:01,390
If you have a, what do you, what do you
call it, like kindle or something, right?

934
00:54:01,391 --> 00:54:04,830
You do that same thing. It's like can
the end, like you're saying you can read.

935
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:07,170
Yeah. Read instead. So
if you had a camera,

936
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:10,460
like once you said like imagine
you're giddy being videotaped.

937
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:14,580
Like what if you're being videotaped all
day and all he did was calculate every

938
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:18,000
time you opened up Instagram or
Facebook or Twitter and or youtube,

939
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:21,960
all those put every time you open up
and you had that scenario in one average

940
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:25,260
day. I mean you take all that
time and replace it with,

941
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,960
you opened your kindle to read
more bus out of book, you know,

942
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:31,380
you've bringing books or whatever we do.
And that's how to, instead of doing that,

943
00:54:31,381 --> 00:54:32,131
you did the book,
right?

944
00:54:32,131 --> 00:54:35,880
You know how much reading you do that
you'd read so much reading. Yeah.

945
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,420
So it's like, yeah, those are the time
sucks man. Your phone, it's so available,

946
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:43,680
you know? But probably you can read
on your phone too. That's a big one.

947
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,010
TV Too.
He watched TV and not really.

948
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,810
Probably I watched one show now it
actually to Hawaii, five o and that's it.

949
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:56,050
Sometimes Shark tank. That's it
man. 100% it's weird. What does it,

950
00:54:56,060 --> 00:55:00,240
how often does the Hawaii five o on
once a week and it goes in seasons.

951
00:55:00,241 --> 00:55:04,590
So you got, how long has this Susan?
I Dunno. 13 episodes I guess. I Dunno.

952
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,380
I Dunno.
But on the last,

953
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,030
I have watched one TV show recently.
It's called billions.

954
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:13,763
Oh,
well

955
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:20,580
there's a little scenario unfolding
on billions. All right. Well yeah,

956
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,090
actually, yeah. And keep in mind,

957
00:55:25,091 --> 00:55:28,540
it's not like I've never seen any
other show ever. It never will.

958
00:55:28,541 --> 00:55:30,160
It's not that I'm just saying,
you know how people

959
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:33,270
no watch Tino routinely. And actually, um,

960
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:38,000
I will separate the fact that nowadays
you can watch TV in a different way.

961
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,460
Right? It's not like at eight
o'clock on a Thursday night.

962
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:43,700
You've got to sit there and watch 30
minute show with the 30 minutes worth of

963
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:46,500
commercials in it. Right?
No, you can. You're,

964
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:48,363
you're

965
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,060
on a flight somewhere.
You've read,

966
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,560
you've got to take it easy
on your eyes a little bit.

967
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,930
If you start reading too much,
you've read for a long time. Okay.

968
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:56,430
You're going to stare out the
window for a little while,

969
00:55:56,431 --> 00:55:59,730
listen to this part of a podcast or
something. Then you're like, okay,

970
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,640
my brain is like barely functioning.
Okay.

971
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:04,380
I'm going to watch an episode of billions.

972
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:08,990
Yeah. On ballers. He everything I
have not, I don't know the different,

973
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,310
well I do know the difference.

974
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,930
I watched that for a little bit but you
know like people will have a routine

975
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:15,823
like tonight,
you know,

976
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,610
every night for 30 minutes they
watched TV with their kids or whatever.

977
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:24,010
It's like that doesn't really happen.
Yeah.

978
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,670
Next question. Really Sad.

979
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:34,090
How much time you can waste these days
with the distractions that are people

980
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:35,650
trying to get that time from you?

981
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,780
Yeah. Your discipline. Like when
you, when you first start thinking,

982
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,930
disciplining quick. Oh, when I
first started hearing it from you,

983
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,540
that was like one of the things
that popped into my head.

984
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:49,010
Like as being really obvious. Like if
you are disciplined with your time,

985
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,880
you will have a lot of free time.
Like a lot, a lot of free time,

986
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,850
way more than you would think
anyway because you know,

987
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:00,140
even when I'm like real busy, you know,
if I can accurately remember my day,

988
00:57:00,141 --> 00:57:03,800
I can remember like just like five
minutes here, 15 minutes there like that.

989
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:07,970
I did something that was a waste of
time and if you add up all those little

990
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:11,230
minutes you have probably hours,
probably hours for to do.

991
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:16,830
Yeah, do something progressive, you know,

992
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,830
productive, progressive, progress,
your life, valuable, valuable,

993
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,860
all those things. Check.
All right. Next question.

994
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:25,520
Would you,

995
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:29,870
would your extreme ownership philosophy
have changed or lost confidence if you

996
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:34,871
had been relieved of command when taking
ownership of friendly fire incident you

997
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:36,110
described in your first book?

998
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,650
The book extreme ownership
by the way. Yes. Just

999
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,460
to,
to be perfectly clear about this,

1000
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,480
I wasn't taking ownership of the
situation shifts so that I could keep,

1001
00:57:48,481 --> 00:57:53,481
my job wasn't a political maneuver
to set myself up to look good.

1002
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,960
I was taking ownership
of the situation because

1003
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:03,180
I was the leader of the
situation that took place.

1004
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:06,060
I was the guy responsible
for what was happening.

1005
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,990
I was taking ownership because
that was the correct thing.

1006
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,970
The correct thing is something bad
had happened and I was in charge of it

1007
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,750
and yes I could have been fired and if
I would have been fired I would have

1008
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:26,050
accepted it and I wouldn't
have done anything different.

1009
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:29,010
So again,

1010
00:58:29,011 --> 00:58:33,240
this is sort of similar to a couple
of questions go like that's extreme.

1011
00:58:33,241 --> 00:58:36,300
Ownership is not about avoiding trouble.

1012
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:39,180
It's not about avoiding trouble.
You don't say,

1013
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:43,410
well I own it and then you don't get in
trouble. No, you actually could get fired.

1014
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,040
You actually could get fired.
And that's why,

1015
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,940
that's why that idea of
preemptive ownership,

1016
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,710
I talked about that at one of the
monsters. If, if in the back of your mind,

1017
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,440
in the back of my mind I think, you know
what, if the platoon makes a mistake,

1018
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,330
I can just blame it on them.
I'll be good.

1019
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:04,690
Well now I'm not really that worried
about their plan cause I got that little

1020
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,501
out if I need,

1021
00:59:05,501 --> 00:59:07,810
I'm not worried about if the
guys understand the rules
of engagement because I

1022
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:08,980
got that a little out if I need it.

1023
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:11,530
I'm not that worried about deconfliction
cause it's got that little out if they

1024
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:12,364
screwed up.

1025
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,850
So I have an out for myself and so I
don't really put 100% effort into the

1026
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:22,250
planning and uh, of the,
of what we're doing,

1027
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,380
if I have preemptive ownership,
which says, hey, no matter
what happens out here,

1028
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,910
it's my fault. Guess what? Hey guys,
do you understand the honorees?

1029
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,290
Let me talk to you about them.
Get, Hey, hey leaf. Do you,

1030
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,410
do you guys understand where the,
where the lines of limits of advance our,

1031
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:39,140
so you know where you get desire. You guys
don't understand, hey dude, do we see,

1032
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:41,990
do we have it marked out clearly?
Okay, great. Hey, do the, you know,

1033
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,220
like dig in and when you dig in on
stuff then you have less of a chance of

1034
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,210
something going wrong.

1035
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,330
But when something does go wrong and
you take ownership of what you take

1036
00:59:50,331 --> 00:59:54,410
ownership of it. Not to avoid
trouble but to face trouble. Hmm.

1037
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,720
That's what you have to do.
So my,

1038
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:03,230
my idea hasn't changed.
In fact,

1039
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:08,620
if I would have blamed someone else and
then kept my job and someone else gotten

1040
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,580
fired,
I would have had a real problem with that.

1041
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,680
I could not have lived with myself

1042
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,100
maintaining that position,

1043
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:24,160
knowing that I had sacrificed someone
below me in the chain of command for my

1044
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:29,840
own good. That doesn't sit with me man.
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

1045
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,880
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

1046
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:36,590
And that's why when I was trying to
figure out who to blame it on cause I was,

1047
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,080
cause I was looking at this big problem
because there was a lot of bad things

1048
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:40,940
and I'm thinking about a cookie,
who's fault was this snack?

1049
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:45,941
Couldn't figure out why I didn't feel
comfortable saying it was this guy who was

1050
01:00:47,271 --> 01:00:50,160
that guy. It'd be like this guy and the
previous one guy that wireless bill,

1051
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,090
his fault.
I don't feel comfortable saying that.

1052
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,760
Especially when I'm in charge and I
don't feel comfortable when I'm a peer

1053
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:57,600
either. If I'm, if my peer and when,

1054
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,960
but we're part of a team
and something goes wrong.

1055
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:03,860
I don't feel comfortable saying it
was the other guy who does that.

1056
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,820
Who feels good about that.
Right? Don't be that person.

1057
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:12,770
And only that when you're,
when you see people acting that way,

1058
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,510
everybody can identify that
that's a bad thing to do. Yeah,

1059
01:01:18,530 --> 01:01:21,080
but they do it anyways because their ego.

1060
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,700
So keep it in check. Yeah. Yeah.

1061
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:31,280
X question whether directly or indirectly.

1062
01:01:31,310 --> 01:01:33,470
I know Jocko follows this principle.

1063
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,960
The way you do anything is
the way you do everyday.

1064
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:37,360
This is an intro.

1065
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,860
This question I had to pull out
because what you're going to see,

1066
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:42,550
it's very,

1067
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:46,150
I think it's a question maybe you might
be even more suited to answer than me.

1068
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,680
We'll go ahead. Proceed. Interesting.

1069
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:52,960
Now let's say you're sitting on the
couch and you want to switch the light on

1070
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:58,290
the switches to your right and you know
there's a 95% chance that you can reach

1071
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:01,930
it from where you're sitting
without having to leave.
The couch, what do you do?

1072
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:07,290
Do you take the chance to reach it or
to reach for it in vain and then get up,

1073
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,580
walk to the switch and turn it on?

1074
01:02:09,581 --> 01:02:13,570
Or do you get up right away and make and
make the extra effort and get it done

1075
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:18,571
in the most efficient manner regardless
of if there was potentially an way.

1076
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,090
And

1077
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:25,680
I get you, I know I'd love to give
some big profound answer about this,

1078
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,410
but here's the deal.
I would accurately assess the distance,

1079
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,360
the light switch right accurately,
accurately,

1080
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:35,070
and I'd figured out the best way to
turn it on and then I'd turn it on.

1081
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,000
That's what I do. I mean, if I've
got to get up out of bed to get up,

1082
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:43,560
get to get out of bed or I'd pull,
uh, pull, uh, we on the couch.

1083
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:48,010
Is that the situation? I'm going to
need the light off, so, yeah. All right.

1084
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,090
Get the light on my phone out and
just see what I got to see with the,

1085
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:56,040
cause I'm thinking out of the box over
on my side. Right. That's what I'm doing.

1086
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,680
What she did as far as the,
as far as the thing,

1087
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:01,950
the way you do anything is the way you
do everything, and it's partly true,

1088
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:03,440
but at the same time,
guess what?

1089
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,440
You got to prioritize and execute and
there are some things that are not as

1090
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:11,790
important as other things.

1091
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:17,270
My famous example is that my gym
floor in my home gym is not clean.

1092
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,850
It's there's chalk on it,
there's some sweat stains.

1093
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,910
I don't go in there three times a week
with a mop and swab it and get all the

1094
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:32,310
chalk out and power wash it.

1095
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:35,820
That's what it would take maybe two
times a week if I power washed it,

1096
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:38,640
pulled all this stuff out of the
garage, power, washed the mats,

1097
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,620
pull them back in there,
set the garage back up.

1098
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,230
That's what it would take to keep
the mats clean. That doesn't,

1099
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:47,520
I don't care if those mats or clean
or not doesn't matter me. Right?

1100
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,230
I have to prioritize. There's much, much,

1101
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:54,320
much more important things than whether
my mats in my garage gym are clean.

1102
01:03:55,550 --> 01:03:59,510
Doesn't matter. Yep. Did you do
maths are different, right? Jujitsu,

1103
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,080
Matt's gotta be clean.
Those guys,

1104
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:03,990
this is why we got people to clean
those mats after classes. Sure.

1105
01:04:04,620 --> 01:04:08,250
That's a priority. The ones at my
house that just me don't matter.

1106
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:12,750
That doesn't mean that I'm
slacking in other areas, right?

1107
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:15,060
There's a minimum standard in
certain things like there's,

1108
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,980
and even my home gym mats,

1109
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:21,540
I have a vacuum and I hit him with the
vacuum when I get too much dog hair on

1110
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:24,720
them, which actually I do that
like every one or two days.

1111
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,270
It takes three minutes
to just vacuum dog hair,

1112
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:31,650
but there's a minimum
standard to hold the line.

1113
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,070
And as far as doing things
the most efficient way,

1114
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,630
I try and do things the right way, but
didn't try and do things the right way,

1115
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:44,550
which generally that coincides with
the most efficient way generally,

1116
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,670
generally. But here, that's not
what he's talking about here.

1117
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:52,630
So when you say it again when you said,
here's the thing man, Bro, this guy,

1118
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,750
you don't,
we don't have his name but man,

1119
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:56,880
we need to get together
and like talk because this,

1120
01:04:56,970 --> 01:05:00,810
this is the kind of stuff that I think
about all the time in this obsessive way.

1121
01:05:00,811 --> 01:05:03,660
But this enters my mind, man.
That's a good question too.

1122
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:08,280
So basically he's asking like, okay, and
it happens for literally half a second,

1123
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,270
maybe one whole second or like, okay man,
I need the light on. What do I do? Do I

1124
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:15,720
like how he said do I reach for it?

1125
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:18,040
Because that's the easiest way I
don't have to up use on my leg and

1126
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,590
back muscles to stand up and walk over.
Like just reach for it.

1127
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,740
But if I can't reach
it now we've got to do,

1128
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:25,210
expend all the energy of reaching for it,
failing,

1129
01:05:25,211 --> 01:05:28,320
bring my hand back and then doing the
standing up being that it was trying to

1130
01:05:28,321 --> 01:05:32,350
avoid in the first place. So it's one
of those things. So what do I do, man?

1131
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:35,190
What do I do? We just chance
it or do I just be like, hey,

1132
01:05:35,191 --> 01:05:36,280
you don't have not got
a chance to anything.

1133
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:39,670
I'm just going to expand the extra energy
and turn on the light, so what do I do?

1134
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,760
Right? Yeah, man. It's a conundrum.
Same thing with the soy sauce polls.

1135
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:47,530
Same thing also. Here's the, here's one.
You might, did you see the meme? Yes.

1136
01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:48,880
There's,
there's a couple of standards.

1137
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:52,870
There's a couple of meetings about you
and the soy sauce balls. One of them,

1138
01:05:52,871 --> 01:05:56,200
one of them was like a black and
white photo. Did you see that one?

1139
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,810
I was like a black and white photo,
but it said something.

1140
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:04,690
It was this black and white photo of, of
soy sauce bowls. Oh yeah. What did it say?

1141
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:09,110
This is better than the struggle is real.
Yeah,

1142
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,040
and then they had the superhero
looking guy that had but two buttons.

1143
01:06:14,290 --> 01:06:19,090
Anyway, here's one, and here's when
that, this is, this one's a real problem.

1144
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:22,250
Small but a real problem for
most of you from when you're,

1145
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,720
when you're laying in bed at night,
you're, you're sleeping and you wake up,

1146
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:30,490
you're like, man, I gotta I gotta take,
I gotta use the bathroom but not too bad.

1147
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:33,760
I don't have to use about their bad
just a little bit. So what do I do?

1148
01:06:33,761 --> 01:06:37,690
Do I hold it power through the discomfort
because discomfort isn't that that,

1149
01:06:37,691 --> 01:06:42,280
and hopefully I'll fall asleep cause I
don't want to get up and wake myself up

1150
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:44,500
more and turn on the light and do all
this stuff and walk around and get the

1151
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,990
blood flowing. And then what if I
can't fall asleep as quick or whatever,

1152
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:51,760
or I'm tired. I don't even want to get
out of bed, you know? So what do I do?

1153
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,840
Because if I go use the bathroom on man,
I'll be fully relaxed. It'll be done.

1154
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:58,240
I don't need, it won't keep me up.
That discomfort won't keep me up.

1155
01:06:58,241 --> 01:07:01,480
But if I can fall back asleep,
I didn't even have to get out of bed.

1156
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:06,040
You see what I'm saying? So what do you
do? You're at that. And if you really got,

1157
01:07:06,041 --> 01:07:08,320
he's about to miss no issue
because it's obvious, you know?

1158
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:12,320
But if you just have to a little bit,
it's a hard question, right? It's true.

1159
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,350
Don't even ask. Don't even, I
didn't know. What do you mean?

1160
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:18,580
I said I spend zero seconds.

1161
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,390
I spend zero seconds thinking
about that issue. Zero.

1162
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,260
This is no factor whatsoever. You're like,
I'm going to go use the bathroom here.

1163
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:30,220
Here's my, here's my answer to your
question. If I have to go to the bathroom,

1164
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:32,560
I go to the bathroom. If you kind of
have to go to the bathroom though,

1165
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,920
there's no kind of yes.
No, no, no, no. You're,

1166
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,210
it's like if your bladder is full.
Okay. You got, he's about 20 feet.

1167
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,950
What if your bladder is one third full?
Then I don't have to go to the bathroom.

1168
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:46,340
Oh, okay. So you have a distinct
like cutoff then in feelings.

1169
01:07:46,341 --> 01:07:50,410
So you didn't have that great end
up most or, I don't. So most of us,

1170
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:53,380
we don't have it like that. No.
We got to like consider, you know,

1171
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:59,080
the same way that this guy was no
done than others. Anyway. Anyway,

1172
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:03,820
I dig it and man that's going to
be one of those ongoing challenges.

1173
01:08:03,821 --> 01:08:05,770
I think you know,
I think the main,

1174
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:09,250
I almost left that whole second half of
the question because the main point of

1175
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:12,400
the question was the way you do anything
is the way you do everything. Yes,

1176
01:08:12,401 --> 01:08:14,950
that's true to a point. You
should definitely keep, you know,

1177
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,590
you try and maintain consistent effort
and hold the line and everything,

1178
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:21,950
but the dichotomy is that if you try
and hold the line on every single thing

1179
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:25,790
that's not possible and you'd spend
your whole life cleaning up everything

1180
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:30,290
around you and fixing things and
you'd be wasting time when you have,

1181
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:32,780
you need to prioritize and execute,
pick the biggest problems,

1182
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:36,170
pick the biggest things are going to have
the most impact on you and then focus

1183
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:40,450
on those things and don't worry
about some other things. Shoot man.

1184
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,410
That's that little
conundrum as everywhere.

1185
01:08:42,530 --> 01:08:46,530
But sometimes it'll be vacuuming and then
you know how like when you vacuum over

1186
01:08:46,531 --> 01:08:48,950
it, like I don't know what to say.
It's a piece of big piece of lint.

1187
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:52,790
You go over the vacuum once, you know
and he doesn't go in, you go again.

1188
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:56,180
It doesn't go. You need to go, you go. I
could've picked that thing up like three,

1189
01:08:56,181 --> 01:08:57,920
four seconds ago.
So why didn't you?

1190
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:00,920
Cause I thought he could have actually
could have got it with the vacuum and I

1191
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,590
wouldn't have to bend down. You know what
I mean? It's like that kind of stuff.

1192
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:08,420
It depends on the topic. Laziness. Too
Old. It's efficiency. Not Laziness,

1193
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,430
but either way. You know
what though? This guy,

1194
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:14,420
you combined with this guy's question
answered the question with how you do

1195
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:16,970
everything. You just establish a
protocol. If there's a question,

1196
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:21,170
you just do the guaranteed ones. Yeah. If
I see a piece of the land, I vacuum it.

1197
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:23,510
They didn't go up bone, pick it
up. That's it. A hundred maybe.

1198
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:25,070
You get a double tick.
Right.

1199
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,920
Generally you got to go forward
and back when the vacuum anyways.

1200
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,730
You know what I'm saying? You can
just rerun that same track. Yeah.

1201
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:33,710
Cause you know you're going
forward back but you're,

1202
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:36,260
you're offsetting a little bit.
Yeah. And sometimes the back,

1203
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:38,570
depending on your brush,
depending on the back or the back ones,

1204
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:42,350
sometimes it's more powerful. Okay.
Cause the brush spins a certain way.

1205
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:46,910
Interesting. But either way.
Yeah, either way. Repeat.
Okay. No. And then guess what?

1206
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:50,690
On the forward stroke, you can go now to
your next track and you can bend down,

1207
01:09:50,691 --> 01:09:53,120
grab a piece of lint.
You're good to go. Yeah. So,

1208
01:09:53,121 --> 01:09:55,670
and the point is establish a protocol
where it's like, you know what,

1209
01:09:55,671 --> 01:09:59,150
I'm not going to waste my time. No. You
know, risking it and all this stuff.

1210
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,060
I'm just going to go for the real deal.

1211
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:07,450
All right, next question.
Jocko. I'm a firefighter

1212
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:08,420
slash.
Emt.

1213
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:13,220
I recently and recently I went on
a call where a patient didn't live.

1214
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:15,590
Not unusual by any means.

1215
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:19,520
Unfortunately I deal with loss
of life on almost a daily basis.

1216
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,210
I detach and do my job,
always working to get better.

1217
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,580
This call I failed to detach.

1218
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,530
It hit me hard when the patient's husband
let out a chilling, let out, chilling,

1219
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:31,364
screams.

1220
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:37,030
As third year old wife went from alert
and talking to dead within minutes,

1221
01:10:37,730 --> 01:10:40,400
I let myself enter into his shoes.
At that moment.

1222
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:43,940
I got over it quick during
my days off and moved on.

1223
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,560
It's part of the job and I accept that,

1224
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:50,030
but my question is when does
it become inhumane? To Detach?

1225
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,770
Do we sometimes need to let some
weakness through to remain grounded when

1226
01:10:54,771 --> 01:10:57,920
dealing with such major
incidents is loss of life.

1227
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:04,860
Okay? First of all, sympathy
and empathy are not weaknesses.

1228
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:07,440
They're not weaknesses.
In fact,

1229
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:12,470
it actually takes strength to be able
to deal with these types of situations

1230
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,390
and these types of emotions.

1231
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:20,220
The week move would actually be to
cut those emotions off completely.

1232
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,203
So

1233
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:27,080
that being said,
as you know,

1234
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:32,200
obviously there is a dichotomy because
you cannot let the emotions overwhelm

1235
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:40,520
you. As a matter of fact, if you
get overwhelmed by your feelings,

1236
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:42,920
then you can't do your job properly,

1237
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:46,790
which in its own right is inhumane
because now you're not able to treat the

1238
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:49,850
patients that you're trying to save
because you're getting too emotional about

1239
01:11:49,851 --> 01:11:52,220
it. So where do you have
to do the answer for the,

1240
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:55,760
for the millionth time of a different
subject, but comes up all the times.

1241
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:56,600
You've got to find balance.

1242
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,700
You have to find balance between being
emotional enough about not being too

1243
01:12:01,701 --> 01:12:02,121
emotional.

1244
01:12:02,121 --> 01:12:07,121
You have to learn to recognize if you're
going too far in one direction or the

1245
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:09,110
other and you have to
do a self assessment,

1246
01:12:09,111 --> 01:12:12,620
you have to look and see
and make sure that the,

1247
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,300
that you see the people
you're treating as people,

1248
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:20,870
you have to look at them and make sure
that you're seeing them as people,

1249
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:25,550
that you're not seeing them as a hunk
of meat. Right? You have to do that.

1250
01:12:25,551 --> 01:12:28,430
You have to make sure that you're
doing that. At the same time,

1251
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:33,490
you cannot afford emotionally
to go through the pain of
loss every time you see

1252
01:12:35,121 --> 01:12:38,150
someone die because that's
also going to be a problem.

1253
01:12:38,151 --> 01:12:40,490
You can't afford emotionally to do that.

1254
01:12:40,491 --> 01:12:45,491
You can't go through that pain
over and over and over again.

1255
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:48,733
So

1256
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:54,070
you have to, like you said, you have to
detach, normally do a good job with that.

1257
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:58,270
Um, I've seen guys get wounded.
I've seen guys get killed,

1258
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:02,710
I've been around a lot of deaf and when,
when it was around me,

1259
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:06,130
I didn't have time to stop and
think about it. I had to work to do,

1260
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,740
I had to detach myself and do my job

1261
01:13:10,330 --> 01:13:13,990
at the same time when it's over
and the time was appropriate.

1262
01:13:13,991 --> 01:13:17,770
It's like you got to connect with what
happened and make sure that you are

1263
01:13:17,771 --> 01:13:19,510
dealing with it appropriately.

1264
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:26,320
And you know, I always think firefighters
and paramedics and mts and, and,

1265
01:13:26,321 --> 01:13:30,830
and police and military, but you
know, paramedics and he, mts,

1266
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:34,190
you're only showing up if
someone is in a bad way.

1267
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:40,000
And I know that's hard physically and it's
hard. Mentally, it's hard emotionally.

1268
01:13:40,001 --> 01:13:43,000
So find the balance.

1269
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,070
Keep yourself balanced,

1270
01:13:45,130 --> 01:13:48,340
make sure you're not going too
far in one direction or the other,

1271
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:51,100
and thanks for doing your job

1272
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:58,450
easy.
But sometimes you forget that about UMTS.

1273
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:03,430
Yeah, fire for it. The only
time you know where they spray,

1274
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:07,240
I mean pretty much, yeah. This getting
called because someone is in a bad way.

1275
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:11,980
That's what they're showing up
for. You know, cops too, like

1276
01:14:12,340 --> 01:14:13,110
with it,

1277
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:17,950
like it's easy to be on the outside
when you're going to parks and you know,

1278
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,760
if your job is like, you
know, well I don't know me,

1279
01:14:20,761 --> 01:14:24,190
I press record and make coop v or
make videos and whatever, you know,

1280
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:28,060
and this is like every day, so it kind
of forms this kind of vision, you know,

1281
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:30,220
of my world,
whatever.

1282
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,030
But he empties and day every time you get
to call it, it's, it's it, it's just a,

1283
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:39,610
it's just the question is just, Oh, how
bad, you know? Wow. That's where it is.

1284
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:44,390
How bad, how bad of a situation is the
person I'm about to go contend with?

1285
01:14:44,391 --> 01:14:46,910
What's their situation? Yeah, they are.

1286
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,940
They could be everything
from a minor situation too.

1287
01:14:49,941 --> 01:14:52,100
They're going to die in front of me.
Again,

1288
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:57,130
I guess a new person and their life
and their kids and their family and you

1289
01:14:57,951 --> 01:15:02,750
know, Peter Attia talked
about some of that. They're
becoming a bit jaded. In fact,

1290
01:15:02,751 --> 01:15:07,520
it's a pretty horrific story and it's
worth listening to that podcast when he

1291
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:12,521
was on and he talked about how he got to
a point where some patients he started

1292
01:15:13,281 --> 01:15:17,810
to look at, I like Ma, he'd be
mad at them. I'm mad at them.

1293
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:23,270
And that's what you have to
avoid is getting to this point.

1294
01:15:23,271 --> 01:15:23,780
You got to,

1295
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:28,780
you got to do your best to
stay emotionally detached
enough that you can do your

1296
01:15:29,781 --> 01:15:30,470
job,

1297
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:35,470
but at the same time you can't be looking
at other human beings as if they're

1298
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:40,970
just a piece of meat. Yeah, so hard job.

1299
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:45,260
I think we've got time
for one more question.

1300
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:51,290
I have good ideas,
but I have trouble executing.

1301
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:53,000
Do you have any tips?

1302
01:15:56,620 --> 01:16:01,600
I have good ideas,
but I have trouble executing.

1303
01:16:01,601 --> 01:16:04,150
Do you have any tips?

1304
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:13,830
Oh yeah.
You have some good ideas,

1305
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:14,664
do ya,

1306
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:19,920
but you can't execute you.

1307
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:23,810
You want to know what those are?
Those ideas are worth

1308
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,530
when you don't execute on them.
You know what those ideas are worth.

1309
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:29,700
They're worth nothing.

1310
01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:36,140
Ideas by themselves have zero value
unless they can be brought to life.

1311
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:45,170
And I have known plenty of people
with plenty of ideas over the years,

1312
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:48,700
great ideas,
amazing ideas,

1313
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:54,310
but very few people can
actually turn ideas into action.

1314
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:02,140
And those people end up old and bitter
and angry because they didn't execute

1315
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:07,700
their great ideas. And so
here's what you do. You execute.

1316
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,190
You actually

1317
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,150
make things happen.
And sometimes I'm going to tell you,

1318
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:16,010
when you execute your idea,

1319
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,850
it reveals the fact that your
idea isn't all that good.

1320
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:24,300
It's not the brilliant
idea you thought it was.

1321
01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:26,790
And some people are actually afraid
of that and that's what stops him.

1322
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:33,460
But I'm not afraid I say,
but bring on that failure.

1323
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:36,520
Let me learn that my idea is no good.

1324
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,780
Because even if you learned
that your idea is garbage,

1325
01:17:41,781 --> 01:17:46,781
at least you know not to waste any more
time dreaming about it or thinking about

1326
01:17:47,211 --> 01:17:49,220
it.
Go onto your next idea.

1327
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:55,250
But don't let these ideas just
wander aimlessly around in your head.

1328
01:17:55,880 --> 01:18:00,880
Get 'em out, bring them to life,
poured them into the world,

1329
01:18:00,881 --> 01:18:05,680
run with them and get some
friends and family or partners,

1330
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,530
someone to help you.

1331
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:11,280
Maybe get some people that are better
at execution than you are and give them

1332
01:18:11,281 --> 01:18:13,500
some ownership giveaway those ideas.

1333
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:18,240
It's better to give away those ideas then
let them rot inside your head and die.

1334
01:18:22,090 --> 01:18:24,460
And whatever path you take,

1335
01:18:24,461 --> 01:18:29,260
whether you force yourself to execute
or you bring people in to help you,

1336
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:32,620
whatever path you're
gonna take, do it. Do it.

1337
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:35,860
Pour some life into your idea

1338
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,770
and like I said,

1339
01:18:41,771 --> 01:18:46,771
you've got to remember that there's no
guarantee that when you pour life into

1340
01:18:46,841 --> 01:18:48,340
idea,
into an idea,

1341
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,730
there's no guarantee that that
idea is going to come to life too.

1342
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:56,770
You might pour everything you've gotten
to that idea and it can still die

1343
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:02,110
and you might have to let it die.

1344
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:07,120
You have to let the dream die because
some ideas aren't good enough to live.

1345
01:19:07,121 --> 01:19:08,680
That's just the way it is,
but,

1346
01:19:10,470 --> 01:19:12,930
but you don't want at
least give it a chance.

1347
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:19,180
Don't let that idea die inside your head.

1348
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,010
No more waiting,

1349
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:25,030
no more putting it off or waiting for
the right time with the right people or

1350
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:29,290
the right alignment of things
in the world. No more of that,

1351
01:19:29,291 --> 01:19:32,890
no more excuses,
just execution.

1352
01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:39,410
Just go and make it happen.

1353
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:44,363
Okay.

1354
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:48,980
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1355
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,100
So Echo Charlie,

1356
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,850
while we are over here
trying to make things happen.

1357
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,140
So we have to go hard.
We have to execute.

1358
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:04,840
You got anything that could
possibly help us execute? Yeah,

1359
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,930
our mission. Sure. Well,

1360
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,610
let's talk about origin first.

1361
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:16,611
This is an outstanding way to
execute and maintain the execution.

1362
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,800
So while we are doing Jujitsu and you
don't know what kind of gear to get yet,

1363
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:27,720
which would be crazy, but hey, people are
starting every day and when you start,

1364
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:29,490
you do have that question
most of the time.

1365
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,720
What's the maximum age for
starting Jujitsu? Death.

1366
01:20:33,721 --> 01:20:38,070
I think it's the day before you die. The
day before that can be hundred. Whatever.

1367
01:20:38,610 --> 01:20:41,910
The reason you don't start the day
before you die is you don't want to go to

1368
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:45,570
your death bed with regret because as
soon as you even learn a little bit of

1369
01:20:45,571 --> 01:20:49,490
Jujitsu, you'd be like, Dang, I wish I
would've started that a month ago. Yes,

1370
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:53,880
it had a month of solid Jujitsu to
try and learn what was happening,

1371
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,450
how these people were
choking me. Yeah. So yeah,

1372
01:20:57,810 --> 01:21:02,810
we have people all the time starting
to adjust to all ages from four or five

1373
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,710
below that. Yes, you should be
trained in your little kitchen.

1374
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,301
Be Training did you too,

1375
01:21:06,301 --> 01:21:09,000
but it's more of a playful thing that
you do with them because you know the

1376
01:21:09,001 --> 01:21:10,940
techniques and you start
having them escape the mount.

1377
01:21:10,941 --> 01:21:12,090
He started to have them arm lock.

1378
01:21:12,091 --> 01:21:14,880
You have to have them put in that rear
naked choke you to make sure you tell him

1379
01:21:14,881 --> 01:21:18,720
that the rear naked choke is dangerous
and not to do it if you're not around.

1380
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:20,730
Because that is actually a scary thing.
I used to,

1381
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:24,000
I used to be a little bit nervous about
that when my kids were real little.

1382
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,730
You know, they know how to
rear naked choke, you know,

1383
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,440
oh maybe my five year old daughter slaps
a rear naked choke on my two year old

1384
01:21:31,441 --> 01:21:36,441
son and decides to hang on to that
thing cause he's crying or whatever.

1385
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:41,230
So you gotta be, you gotta be very
careful with that. Yeah. Yeah.

1386
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:45,420
And that's a simple deal where
it's not like a, you know,

1387
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,260
a knife or something where it's like, hey,
this is dangerous. Don't let you know.

1388
01:21:49,470 --> 01:21:52,500
It's like, it's a little bit more cut
and dry with the rear naked choke.

1389
01:21:52,501 --> 01:21:53,770
It's Kinda like, okay, you have to,

1390
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:58,980
you have to deliberately apply the
choke and execute the job for it to be

1391
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,520
dangerous.
Not like a knife.

1392
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:07,521
All I'm saying is if you got little
tiny kids below the black for two,

1393
01:22:07,921 --> 01:22:11,130
three, four, five, yes.
You teach them basic moves,

1394
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,800
you need to explain to them that
the moves are real. Yeah. Um,

1395
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,630
and they do work. Yeah. And that's,

1396
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,810
I always warn the little kids about
the ones kids are a little bit older.

1397
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:24,660
They understand cause it happens to them
and they know what's going on. Yeah.

1398
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,930
So be careful with that part
of Jujitsu for the little kids,

1399
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:32,931
but whether kids are four or whether
you're 60 or 70 or 80 years old,

1400
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,140
go get your Jujitsu on going to need a
g g and or rash guard actually Mirage

1401
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:42,090
beat and the rest guard
shack at least one check.

1402
01:22:42,091 --> 01:22:46,690
So what kind of Geek origin [inaudible]
planning to choose from planning and be

1403
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:49,530
increasing by the as time goes on,
straight up,

1404
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:55,110
all made in America and factually
the best cookies in the world.

1405
01:22:55,710 --> 01:23:00,450
Yeah and when you buy an origin g you are,

1406
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:06,410
you are investing not only in yourself
but you're also investing in this great

1407
01:23:07,181 --> 01:23:07,960
country.

1408
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:12,670
As we rebuild manufacturing
inside our country,

1409
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:16,990
bringing back the old New England
factories that they sent overseas,

1410
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,720
we're bringing them back.
We are actually bringing them back.

1411
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,380
We are buying equipment
back from overseas.

1412
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:27,730
Who bringing it back here on ships. Can
you imagine that's happening right now?

1413
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,010
We are doing that.
You are doing that.

1414
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:34,630
You are making that
happen also we got jeans.

1415
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:39,520
Here's the deal.
I talked to Pete p Roberts origin.

1416
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:43,420
I said, Pete, how many people do you
know the do Jujitsu? And he's like,

1417
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:48,190
oh a hundred. I said, how many people
do you know that own a pair of jeans?

1418
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:53,620
And he said 200 million. I
said, we need to make jeans.

1419
01:23:53,650 --> 01:23:55,930
Everyone wants genes.
Everyone needs genes.

1420
01:23:55,931 --> 01:24:00,931
Everyone would want jeans that are
not only high quality but also made in

1421
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:06,160
America sewn by craftsmen in Maine.

1422
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,580
So yeah,
we've got origin jeans.

1423
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:14,830
They're awesome. We got our
can denim, American denim,

1424
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:19,150
like cotton,
cotton cock tineas sewn here,

1425
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,550
Jean and grown.
There you go.

1426
01:24:21,990 --> 01:24:23,860
Was probably p Robert's hadn't
come up with that one yet.

1427
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:28,870
Grown and sold in America baby.
Boom. There it is. Well also joggers,

1428
01:24:28,871 --> 01:24:30,670
speaking of pants,
jeans or pants.

1429
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,730
Obviously joggers don't get
into a joke cause you're,

1430
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:36,460
you're not allowed to do joggers.

1431
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:40,210
But for us who like
comfort and functionality,

1432
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:43,030
maybe of twist of style of whatever.
This is younger so isn't there.

1433
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,120
Why don't we keep bringing
up joggers specifically?

1434
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:48,730
Is it because of my experience
with the younger, like the joggers,

1435
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:52,390
people like joggers and you can also
get supplements. We have supplements.

1436
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:55,500
We have joint warfare, we have krill oil,
we have discipline. You have discipline.

1437
01:24:55,510 --> 01:24:58,180
Go according to Jp Denelle,

1438
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:03,010
when he takes discipline go,
he can see people's thoughts.

1439
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:08,110
I was like, there were so fired
up. He did, you know, an event,

1440
01:25:08,111 --> 01:25:10,780
fresh lawn in front of you. It's
like, he's like, I was so fired up,

1441
01:25:10,781 --> 01:25:13,880
I could see people's thoughts and I'm
like, I liked the way that sounds.

1442
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:18,850
So discipline, go nootropic
get the uh, mind kicking.

1443
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:22,750
And then you've got disciplined for
pre workout. Krill oil, joint warfare,

1444
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,220
keep the bones, the tendons, ligaments,

1445
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:31,930
ligaments, keep all that
stuff good to go. Maintained.

1446
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,040
Uninflamed so there's inflammation.
What's the anti inflammation.

1447
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:40,360
So keep them anti inflamed and keep
them moving. Keep them lubricated,

1448
01:25:40,361 --> 01:25:45,040
keep them functioning. Very
important. And in milk we got milk.

1449
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:49,240
Some people don't even know what mark is.
And it's really easy to explain.

1450
01:25:49,241 --> 01:25:53,110
Milk is milk happens to have what?

1451
01:25:53,111 --> 01:25:57,640
22 grams of protein in there.
Clean protein by the way,

1452
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:02,310
which is different, you know? And it
was just very delicious. And those,

1453
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,560
I'll talk to my friend Kenny

1454
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,570
the other day. He's like, oh yeah, what's
so special about this thing? And it Kinda,

1455
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,070
I got past, I detached, you know, I got
past that emotion a little bit emotional.

1456
01:26:13,071 --> 01:26:16,010
But I was like, I started like going
into this whole pitch to my friend.

1457
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:19,970
By the way, it turned out to be a
pitch, but just like how it's all clean.

1458
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:23,000
And then we use know monk fruit
to sweeten it and it's like,

1459
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:24,590
it doesn't taste like some
day I think or whatever.

1460
01:26:24,591 --> 01:26:26,960
It's like a dessert at the
end of the day I think.

1461
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:30,320
I think he accepted the bid thing to do.
If someone wants to know,

1462
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:33,650
he'd get mixed one up. Yeah. Cause as soon
as you mix one on people like, Oh yeah,

1463
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:35,360
I'm pretty, I'm ordering
it. I'm getting this now.

1464
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:38,570
Cause how can this be good for you?
That's the question.

1465
01:26:38,571 --> 01:26:42,470
How can this be good for you?
Yeah, it tastes like that.
It's true. Milk, chocolate,

1466
01:26:42,471 --> 01:26:47,030
peanut butter, chocolate,
vanilla, gorilla, darkness.

1467
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,670
The darkness.
And then there's,

1468
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:55,040
this is what I believe to be
kind of epic warrior can Moke.

1469
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,020
Yes,
because warrior kid milk.

1470
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:02,210
You can go to your grocery store and you
can buy something that will flavor the

1471
01:27:02,211 --> 01:27:06,050
milk so that your kids will drink milk,
but while your drink,

1472
01:27:06,051 --> 01:27:09,350
while you're giving the milk,
you're also giving them poison.

1473
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:16,000
Right. Is Sugar or is enough? Yeah. You
can eat enough sugar that you die. Right.

1474
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:20,420
People do it all the time.
They get beat us. Yeah,

1475
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:24,500
so we don't want to give our kids poison.
We want to give them power.

1476
01:27:24,860 --> 01:27:28,160
How do we do what we got? Warrior Kid
Moke we've got strawberry and chocolate.

1477
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:31,730
They taste amazing.
They are engineered.

1478
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:36,710
The best possible food that
your kids gunny eat. Yeah.
Think about it. You can say,

1479
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:39,830
Oh, you want some dessert and
they'll get all excited here.

1480
01:27:39,831 --> 01:27:44,240
Have a strawberry milkshake and
what do they think? Thank you.

1481
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:47,690
Can I have more? And you know what
you say? Sure, of course you can.

1482
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,610
You can have all you want because
this is pea protein and probiotics and

1483
01:27:52,611 --> 01:27:53,480
vitamins.

1484
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,870
This is everything you're supposed to
be eating as a child to grow up and be

1485
01:27:56,871 --> 01:27:59,240
strong and a world beater.

1486
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:05,270
You the tower. All
right, check. Yes. Okay.

1487
01:28:05,271 --> 01:28:05,691
Also,

1488
01:28:05,691 --> 01:28:10,691
if you want to stay on the
path and represent at the
same time attire wise jock

1489
01:28:10,811 --> 01:28:15,290
was store, it's called Jocko store. So
you get a chocolate store.com that's,

1490
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:19,670
we can get your tee shirts,
rash guards for the Jujitsu.

1491
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:23,420
And it's good to have more than one
rash guard for multiple reasons.

1492
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:26,840
One is that if one gets dirty,
you don't have to rush to wash it.

1493
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,240
A rush to get it back
into rotation necessarily.

1494
01:28:29,241 --> 01:28:32,100
It can be a whole decision making process.
You got to deal with Iran,

1495
01:28:32,210 --> 01:28:35,360
which can be problematic for
Echo Charles. It's possible. Yes.

1496
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:40,130
But you know what I ran into and this is
so psychological, so I were, you know,

1497
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,941
whatever.

1498
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:44,830
I have a bunch rash guard so I get
injured wearing this one rash card I got

1499
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:49,510
won't wear it anymore cause I'm like
superstition.

1500
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:54,170
Yeah. But here's the thing. I know that
superstitions is fake, but you know what?

1501
01:28:54,171 --> 01:28:58,250
I'm superstitious. Superstitious
about being super superstar.
No, no, I don't care.

1502
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,280
Yeah. See for sure didn't hurt you,
bro. Bro. I know exactly what hurt me.

1503
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:05,700
That's what makes it even worse.
Either way, whether that's your issue,

1504
01:29:05,730 --> 01:29:10,460
retire the rash guard that you weren't
today when we were training. No, no,

1505
01:29:10,770 --> 01:29:13,100
no. Are you sure? No, because

1506
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:18,450
I see, I see what you did there. No,

1507
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:22,290
that none another white rescue or
the word today was all good. He was,

1508
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:26,010
the problem I had today was psychological
and it wasn't really, actually,

1509
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:29,840
you're my problem. You
are my problem. Yeah.

1510
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:34,860
It's funny though, for all my
Jiu Jitsu career, you know,

1511
01:29:34,861 --> 01:29:37,680
if I have a good role with someone
and I and I and I, you know,

1512
01:29:37,681 --> 01:29:41,540
do good against them. A
lot of times they say, Oh,

1513
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:45,150
you're really strong. Right? They never
say like, oh, you got good Jujitsu.

1514
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:49,410
They never say, oh, like I liked
your guard passing, or hey,

1515
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:52,140
you got a really good hip
movement. No, they don't say that.

1516
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,320
What did they say is your strong,
yeah,

1517
01:29:55,020 --> 01:30:00,020
that's what they say today I got my first
kind of alternate compliment from Echo

1518
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:04,230
Charles. You didn't
say I was strong? Nope.

1519
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:07,590
You said I psychologically destroyed you.
Yeah.

1520
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,500
What was it? The whole
thing. Okay, so you,

1521
01:30:13,501 --> 01:30:17,250
and you've been doing this kind
of recently where like I can't,

1522
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,130
I don't even have to be breathing hard,
but just maybe just a little,

1523
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:23,700
you'll like act, you'd be like put on
this little charade. Like oh I like,

1524
01:30:23,730 --> 01:30:26,100
oh we're all like pushy or
something. You'd be like, oh man.

1525
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:28,710
Like you want to say that? But
you'll, your body will be like,

1526
01:30:28,711 --> 01:30:30,000
oh that pushes so hard.

1527
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,580
So you'll do that and I know what you're
doing obviously because you make it

1528
01:30:32,581 --> 01:30:36,300
obvious. But then what that
does to me is like, man,

1529
01:30:36,301 --> 01:30:39,720
that's like so you don't really
take me seriously right now.

1530
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,320
So it kind of makes me angry but little
bit like frustrated cause I'm planning

1531
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,830
to do a little something against,
he sounds like there's something

1532
01:30:48,840 --> 01:30:49,441
and then yeah.

1533
01:30:49,441 --> 01:30:54,240
Then when you wind up like doing things
and then I'll kind of look at you and

1534
01:30:54,241 --> 01:30:58,050
kind of feel and then you do this real
good, normal face kind of scenario.

1535
01:30:58,050 --> 01:31:01,570
And I think that I can do good normal
face two, but on the inside I don't,

1536
01:31:01,650 --> 01:31:04,800
I don't feel normal face, you know,
but all I see is like you're just,

1537
01:31:04,801 --> 01:31:07,680
we're just being whatever, making
jokes. If your hand doesn't look like,

1538
01:31:07,681 --> 01:31:08,190
just so you know,

1539
01:31:08,190 --> 01:31:12,540
on the inside and the outside on the
inside you don't feel normal face.

1540
01:31:12,690 --> 01:31:16,530
It doesn't look normal. On the outside it
looks pretty evident. What's happening?

1541
01:31:17,190 --> 01:31:21,810
Well I don't know yet. At the end of the
day it's Sorta just crept in and yeah,

1542
01:31:21,811 --> 01:31:26,811
I didn't like maintain the composure that
I think is required to function at a,

1543
01:31:28,621 --> 01:31:31,380
you know, at a better level than
I did today. Put it that way.

1544
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,400
And the thing is right when the timer
goes off, when we're done it like,

1545
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:39,030
it's like an avalanche of like reflective.

1546
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:42,450
It's about shame. I always think
it's all part of the process.

1547
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,220
No matter how long and painful the
process is. Did you come in today with,

1548
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:52,170
uh, with a good positive attitude on the,
what the outcome was going to be? Yeah.

1549
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:57,120
Do you feel you were feeling good today?
Yes. So, and it just to be accurate.

1550
01:31:57,121 --> 01:31:58,950
Like I don't,
we always joke about this.

1551
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:03,610
I don't come in thinking [inaudible]
I'm gonna get y'all go in of whatever.

1552
01:32:03,611 --> 01:32:06,940
I don't ever really positive.
Are you're sure about that?

1553
01:32:06,941 --> 01:32:11,200
I don't think of that for a fact. There's
been days where if you've come in, you,

1554
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,740
I can see it in your eyes
and you're thinking, I can do
this today. Well, no. Well,

1555
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:21,370
I do think that yes, I can do,
but it's not up. And you kind of,

1556
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:23,320
sometimes you go up out of fear,

1557
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,380
you just try to convince yourself you're
trying to be like a peacock. Right.

1558
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:29,170
Sometimes that happens. That's cool.
I don't, I don't hold it against you.

1559
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:30,004
I just accept it.

1560
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:33,940
But sometimes you actually think like
today's the big day and when I see that

1561
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:38,800
look, yeah, I think, okay,
well good luck. Not about like,

1562
01:32:38,801 --> 01:32:41,560
okay, I'm going to like
beat up John. It's not that.

1563
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:46,620
It's more that like I have a hip thing
is all you need to do is capitalize on

1564
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:49,240
one mistake.
That's all that it is.

1565
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:53,530
You can just play the numbers game now
you know you're good enough at Jujitsu.

1566
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:56,530
Now if I make a mistake, you can
capitalize on it. You can just,

1567
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:57,700
you can just play the odds.

1568
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:01,720
I can beat you a hundred times and I
can beat you a hundred times where I can

1569
01:33:01,721 --> 01:33:04,240
tap you out. No, we don't
even care. It doesn't even,

1570
01:33:04,490 --> 01:33:05,980
it doesn't even doesn't
mean mean anything.

1571
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:10,180
You roll the dice one time and you
get snake eyes. You get the big win.

1572
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:15,580
That's where it's at. Yeah, it, it'd be
a seven or 11 but yeah. All good. Yeah.

1573
01:33:15,581 --> 01:33:20,230
It's like an insurgent situation for sure.
You can smash me all you want,

1574
01:33:20,231 --> 01:33:23,010
but I just get you on time
and devastate. Yeah, but it's,

1575
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,980
and it's normally not like I'm not
necessarily trying to get actually most of

1576
01:33:26,981 --> 01:33:28,870
the time pretty much all the
time. I'm not trying to, like,

1577
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:33,640
the goal is never to tap anyone out
today. It's not that. It's like to,

1578
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:37,930
to practice new things that I feel
like I'm getting a hold of okay.

1579
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:41,860
Against certain levels of people. And
then so you're not trying to tap me out.

1580
01:33:42,330 --> 01:33:46,420
Well then of course I am, but that's not
like a good goal for the day, you know,

1581
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,050
kind of thing.

1582
01:33:47,050 --> 01:33:50,590
It's more like okay I'm going to put
together this like defense and combined

1583
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:52,030
with this little thing and whatever.

1584
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:56,470
And for you it's real specific cause it's
like rolling with you isn't like this

1585
01:33:56,471 --> 01:33:56,800
Wah.

1586
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:01,690
It's like very specific scenario and
which in like includes the psychological

1587
01:34:01,691 --> 01:34:06,130
part and that's why I
noticed the psychological
devastation that you sorta had

1588
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:10,480
today is because after the time
the timer went off, we're done.

1589
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:12,400
It all came to me like,
man,

1590
01:34:12,401 --> 01:34:16,990
you just got destroyed psychologically
so bad that that goals that you had for

1591
01:34:16,991 --> 01:34:19,570
that specific role and for all
roles with chocolate today,

1592
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:22,340
like literally didn't have anything
to do with the role that you just did.

1593
01:34:22,341 --> 01:34:27,220
We talk right now because of like
your whole mindset and mindset,

1594
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,990
you know, and it was all because
of the stuff you're doing.

1595
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:33,850
And here's the kind of the dichotomy of
it. It's like Super Fun when it happens,

1596
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:37,370
but the cause like the frustration
is like pushing you, you know?

1597
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:41,080
But then it's like at the end of the day
it's all just one big game, you know?

1598
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:45,910
But it, it, there is a legitimate
amount of frustration in there for sure.

1599
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:49,900
It's funny cause I can see
that dichotomy in your face.

1600
01:34:49,901 --> 01:34:53,320
Like I can tell that you're mad, but I
can also tell that it's fun, you know?

1601
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,400
But you do get frustrated. Yeah. But
some, sometimes you get legitimately

1602
01:34:58,400 --> 01:34:59,210
like,

1603
01:34:59,210 --> 01:35:03,440
like you make noises that frustration
like groans or growls and you know what I

1604
01:35:03,441 --> 01:35:08,300
mean? Yeah. But it's like at you know how
like when you know what else you'll do,

1605
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,590
let's go get right now. Right. Like
a little kid, like a six year old.

1606
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,020
The thing is like for real. And I said
from the outside I can see how that,

1607
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:17,873
that could,
you know,

1608
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:22,730
like you know what I don't
like is when I tap someone out,

1609
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:24,650
let's say I'm in,

1610
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:30,250
I'm in half guard and I tapped someone
out with something and I let go and then

1611
01:35:30,921 --> 01:35:34,160
they're like, then they want to keep
going. Like as if that just didn't happen.

1612
01:35:34,190 --> 01:35:37,940
Oh from that exact position. You kind of
need that to me today. And I was like,

1613
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,570
I mean it's not, it's not like
it's a big deal, but I was,

1614
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,390
I then I'm like okay,
cause you know,

1615
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:48,140
I mean I did whatever move
I did and then I let go,

1616
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:53,170
you tap and then I let go of it and then
it's like we'll just keep going and I

1617
01:35:54,081 --> 01:35:57,140
don't know why. I'm like, what, why
would we keep going? And you just,

1618
01:35:57,170 --> 01:36:00,500
you just submitted I and there's other,

1619
01:36:00,530 --> 01:36:02,330
the other thing is sometimes people,

1620
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:05,230
I think you've done this to
me like maybe 10 times, no,

1621
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:10,240
maybe five times where you tap and then
like I let go and then you let come at

1622
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:14,630
me like you like you like double leg or
whatever you like grab you and you try

1623
01:36:14,631 --> 01:36:17,960
it, you know, and that, that's
another one I'm like, okay, cool.

1624
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,940
I see where I see how this is going.

1625
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,290
And I think you're doing that
out of frustration. Yeah.

1626
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:25,700
Tyler Shirley partially out
of like you ever understand,

1627
01:36:25,701 --> 01:36:28,100
sometimes you want to learn
what just happened, right?

1628
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:32,360
Like he put me back in that position.
Yes. Cool. Yeah, I get that part too.

1629
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:37,370
Even that kind of bothers me I guess.
But I could see, you know what though,

1630
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:41,210
from an offensive standpoint, like from
Europe position and someone's like, oh,

1631
01:36:41,211 --> 01:36:44,390
can we start from there? It's
kind of like, you know, the flow,

1632
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:47,470
it's like not linear, but
you know, the path of,

1633
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:49,670
of like from start to finish,

1634
01:36:49,671 --> 01:36:54,570
that whole path is like a big
creative learning battle. Fights,

1635
01:36:54,571 --> 01:36:56,720
wins, losses, like it's a whole path.

1636
01:36:56,810 --> 01:37:01,810
I think that's why it bothers me because
I like that whole fit and a completed

1637
01:37:02,331 --> 01:37:06,530
that whole thing, that whole
thing of, cause let's face it,

1638
01:37:06,710 --> 01:37:09,230
it's a big,
there's a lot of things that go on.

1639
01:37:09,380 --> 01:37:11,090
There's a lot of things that happen from,

1640
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:16,270
from we start rolling or you start
rolling with someone to someone submits.

1641
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:18,200
There's all kinds of things,

1642
01:37:18,410 --> 01:37:20,960
especially your starting standing
you've got to take down to contend with.

1643
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:22,820
You've got guard pass and
you've got guard recovery,

1644
01:37:22,821 --> 01:37:25,730
got sweet to get all these things to
get to this point where you can actually

1645
01:37:25,731 --> 01:37:30,731
submit somebody and all of a sudden we're
just going to skip 85% of that battle.

1646
01:37:30,921 --> 01:37:35,630
Which by the way, from my
perspective, all that time,

1647
01:37:36,140 --> 01:37:40,850
all of that battle is I'm, I'm maneuvering
the whole time. You know what I mean?

1648
01:37:40,851 --> 01:37:45,470
Like it's a part of my game. It's all
part of me getting that submission.

1649
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:47,940
Submission doesn't start when
I hit the mat. The submission,

1650
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:52,650
it starts before we shake
hands. You know, Sam,

1651
01:37:53,180 --> 01:37:55,830
when we skip a big chunk of the,
I liked that whole part of the battle.

1652
01:37:56,540 --> 01:37:59,370
When we skip it, I just feel like,
oh that's kind of weird. Yeah.

1653
01:37:59,820 --> 01:38:04,260
Like we just jumped to the end of the
good song that has the Guitar Solo.

1654
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,350
Like no, you've got to listen to the
whole song man. I appreciate that thing.

1655
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,410
You're right. Right. A good movie. Right.

1656
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:14,100
Let's just skip to the scene
where the battle takes place.

1657
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:14,970
You have you ever done that?

1658
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:17,580
You just watched the battle scenes and
not as good as when you watched the whole

1659
01:38:17,581 --> 01:38:19,650
breakup to Colin and I
want to hear the whole,

1660
01:38:19,651 --> 01:38:21,300
I want the whole buildup to take place.

1661
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:25,230
I don't just want to watch the battle
scene. Yeah. That's actually that good.

1662
01:38:25,290 --> 01:38:28,080
And I might actually glad that
we kind of analyzed it because,

1663
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:30,030
cause you cause it could be looked at.

1664
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:32,670
I always looked at it because I've
done that. Like I don't always do that.

1665
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,460
[inaudible]
you've done it probably five times.

1666
01:38:35,461 --> 01:38:39,810
We've rolled thousands of
times and um, it's like, okay,

1667
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:41,070
can we start from there kind of thing.

1668
01:38:41,071 --> 01:38:43,680
And I it because he's a
little bit different, a little
bit different. It's like,

1669
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:48,360
Hey, can you just wait, put that back on
me. Let me see if I could get out. Okay,

1670
01:38:48,361 --> 01:38:51,510
you got out. Cool. Now we'll start
again. I'm not talking about that. Yeah,

1671
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:54,810
I'm talking about what I did. Yeah.
Today where I was like, I didn't say it,

1672
01:38:54,811 --> 01:38:57,690
but I just sort of stayed there kind of
like, let's kind of take it from here.

1673
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:02,040
It goes, you. Yay. That was me. And um,
and I've done that before. Really rarely,

1674
01:39:02,041 --> 01:39:04,860
but I looked at it as shoot,
that was like a pro.

1675
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:07,140
Like I made it a legitimate
mistake right there.

1676
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:10,780
Let me like get back in that mindset
and continue actually rolling. Nothing.

1677
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:13,380
That's part of what bothers
me. Yeah. It's not up to me.

1678
01:39:13,381 --> 01:39:17,730
I think part of what bothers
me is I think to myself,

1679
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:22,680
Oh, you just made this little
mistake and it was kind of a fluke.

1680
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:25,950
That's what you're implying is like,
oh, this is just a little fluke.

1681
01:39:25,951 --> 01:39:29,380
You were lucky that won't happen again.
That's like,

1682
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:32,430
sometimes people get mad when
I submit them. Not very rarely.

1683
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:35,010
I'd say rarely and I'm always like,
man,

1684
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,260
is that this is that much of an
insult that I just have to out.

1685
01:39:39,330 --> 01:39:42,450
You know what I mean? Like I'm not, when
somebody taps me out, I'm not mad at them.

1686
01:39:42,451 --> 01:39:46,770
I don't know. I'm like Dang, nice
job. That was awesome. Good job.

1687
01:39:47,970 --> 01:39:50,160
But yeah,
I think people are mean anyway.

1688
01:39:50,161 --> 01:39:53,280
It's like anytime water get like
anything's out of frustration and it's

1689
01:39:53,281 --> 01:39:56,130
literally like maybe a 30% frustration,

1690
01:39:56,250 --> 01:40:00,420
70% you're just a guy that can
take that kind of abuse. You know?

1691
01:40:00,421 --> 01:40:01,680
Like if you're like,
okay good,

1692
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:06,000
you tapped me out and then I you
turn your back to reset and I yeah,

1693
01:40:06,001 --> 01:40:08,670
I jumped on your back or they're
taking it down, whatever. Like you can,

1694
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:12,780
I won't do that normally to say no.
And even when you do it to me,

1695
01:40:12,781 --> 01:40:13,614
it's not like you,

1696
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:17,280
you haven't ever like jumped in like put
a rear naked choke on or something like

1697
01:40:17,281 --> 01:40:17,670
that.

1698
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:22,200
You've kind of jumped into a slightly
advantageous but normal position for us to

1699
01:40:22,201 --> 01:40:26,430
be in, which is no big deal. Let me give
you, I've taken my back a couple times.

1700
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,770
Yeah. But, and then even then like, Bro,

1701
01:40:28,771 --> 01:40:33,030
we been in this thing for a long
time where it's let's say I got it.

1702
01:40:33,060 --> 01:40:35,190
Maybe that might,
would that even bother you?

1703
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:37,540
Let's say I jumped on your back
in one of those situations.

1704
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:41,940
Then I got the room naked
choke and I finished it.
Well, I would kind of be like,

1705
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:46,310
well, well we both know, you know
like Friday didn't catch you. Yeah.

1706
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:51,570
But I'm real quick back to the, uh,
the path, you know like when you, when,

1707
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:54,160
when you want to like you have a guy
and he wants to start from that same

1708
01:40:54,161 --> 01:40:58,660
position or whatever. Yeah. If you look
at that path, that whole path that is,

1709
01:40:58,661 --> 01:41:02,920
so let's this fate, that's a valuable
path. Every path that you create,

1710
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:05,020
it's like learning and
it's this big and it's fun.

1711
01:41:05,021 --> 01:41:06,550
There's little competitiveness
in there or whatever.

1712
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:11,230
And at the end you finish each path as
like this tree or whatever it's done.

1713
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:15,520
You finish it with your submission when
you win or when you lose two in training

1714
01:41:15,521 --> 01:41:18,820
or, or even in competition for sure
you win or you lose. You can't,

1715
01:41:18,850 --> 01:41:23,700
like after you win and complete your
masterpiece path of wins and losses and go

1716
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:28,300
through the whole thing and you're done
deck, I just can't step in and be like,

1717
01:41:28,301 --> 01:41:31,160
no, it's not done. It's just sort
of paused on my team. Like Bro,

1718
01:41:31,161 --> 01:41:33,640
you can't jump in and dictate that
kind of stuff. You lost brother.

1719
01:41:33,641 --> 01:41:36,090
You got to start all over and try to
create something else. No, you know,

1720
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:40,600
try new song. Can't just meet
her. But at the same time

1721
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:47,220
if you're looking at like training,
rolling as just practice, just training,

1722
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:50,830
just you know, whatever. And so
there's a big difference between, hey,

1723
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:55,260
we're going to actually practice right
now. You're right and we're going to roll.

1724
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:57,640
Yeah. Cause Rolling is
understood that it's competitive.

1725
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:01,450
That's the whole reason it works so
good. It has to be competitive. So yes.

1726
01:42:01,451 --> 01:42:03,580
That's why when you taught me out,
I do consider it,

1727
01:42:03,581 --> 01:42:06,490
no matter how much percentage
of whatever I do consider it.

1728
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:09,010
You beat me straight up
and practice in training,

1729
01:42:09,011 --> 01:42:12,760
you beat me because there's a significant
amount of competition right there.

1730
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,010
So yeah,
you can't be messing,

1731
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,310
messing with the other guys
wins and knew that I can't,

1732
01:42:18,311 --> 01:42:20,650
I'm never doing that ever again.
If you want to do it, it's fine.

1733
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,380
I'm just saying that's noted. If
not fine. I'm not doing noted.

1734
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:26,980
I don't want to be that guy to do it.
Even just being in that guy. Nonetheless,

1735
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,150
back to representing [inaudible]
from Jocko store chocolate stuff.

1736
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,270
Shirts and rash guards and hoodies,
hats.

1737
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:37,810
Cool stuff you want to represent
on the path if you, okay,

1738
01:42:37,811 --> 01:42:41,290
so it made the new a new good shirt. I
think it's on there. Yeah, it's on there.

1739
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:45,110
It's just, it's good.
It's good. Literally, um,

1740
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:49,060
says good on it with the font and,
but it does not have your head on it,

1741
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:53,620
so it's way more basic, you
know? That's the one where like,

1742
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,620
you really gotta be in the know.
You see it in, in the wild.

1743
01:42:56,621 --> 01:42:59,990
You're going to be like, listen,
you know? Yeah. Is that good?

1744
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:04,970
Do you see the dude that got good on his
dms? I think it was this thumbs. Oh yeah,

1745
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:05,501
she,
oh,

1746
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:10,501
on one and Odi on the other and then I
had to dig it in proper font by the way.

1747
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:18,190
It's the game. So yeah, if you want
to represent on the path Jocko,

1748

01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:23,560
Also we got some books,
Mikey and the dragons,

1793
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:28,510
Mike and the dragons is about a little
kid that's trying to overcome some fear

1794
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:33,580
and he does it by reading a book.
The book was called the Dragon Prince.

1795
01:46:33,910 --> 01:46:38,800
Check it out. Mikey and the dragons
also weigh the warrior kid one,

1796
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:41,080
two and soon to be three.

1797
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:46,180
That's a series of books
about a kid that's happened,

1798
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:49,270
kind of normal trouble that kids have,
but he's got an uncle,

1799
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:54,380
uncle Jake who used to be in the tames
and he comes and helps his cousin out or

1800
01:46:54,781 --> 01:46:59,040
he's, yeah, his, his cousins. His
nephew comes and helps his nephew out.

1801
01:46:59,610 --> 01:47:03,540
So those are called way of the warrior
kid marks mission and where there's a

1802
01:47:03,541 --> 01:47:07,350
will is book three also discipline
equals freedom field manual.

1803
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,860
That's a book that you need or to book.
You can give.

1804
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,610
I'm super stoked when I meet
people and they say, Yup,

1805
01:47:17,611 --> 01:47:21,120
I've given 28 copies of the discipline
equals freedom field manual away way to

1806
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,300
other people in my family,
other friends that I have. Why?

1807
01:47:24,301 --> 01:47:29,301
Because it will help people get on
the path and live a better life.

1808
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:34,680
That's a powerful thing. If you can
actually help someone live a better life.

1809
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:36,870
There's a manual on how to live your life.

1810
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:41,310
It's called the discipline equals freedom
field manual. It's not a normal book.

1811
01:47:42,090 --> 01:47:46,380
It's not normal. My publisher,
when he was publishing it,

1812
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:47,341
he said,

1813
01:47:47,341 --> 01:47:51,990
this book is the biggest risk that he
has ever taken in his publishing career.

1814
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:55,410
And the, he also said, and we're actually,

1815
01:47:55,411 --> 01:47:59,910
my agent told me once the book came out,
the book,

1816
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:06,470
the book's sold more than any scenario
that they had predicted for the book.

1817
01:48:07,140 --> 01:48:08,960
So they, you know, they do these
predictions. It's like, Oh,

1818
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:11,250
if it tells us it sells out, it sells
this thing that sells it. It sounds,

1819
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:15,480
the other thing, there's something called
a hundred percent sell through rate,

1820
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:21,000
which means every single book that got
shipped to got sold, this does not happen.

1821
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,040
And then they're back ordered
and I had to make more.

1822
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:28,520
Now the book is still selling like that
discipline equals freedom field manual.

1823
01:48:29,340 --> 01:48:30,330
Why does it keep selling?

1824
01:48:30,331 --> 01:48:33,450
Because people read it and they get it
for people they know. So check it out.

1825
01:48:33,690 --> 01:48:38,100
It is the manual telling you how to
get on the path and stay on the path.

1826
01:48:38,370 --> 01:48:42,720
The audio version of that book is
not on audible, it's on Itunes,

1827
01:48:42,721 --> 01:48:45,930
it's on Amazon music, it's on
Google play and other MP3 platforms.

1828
01:48:46,230 --> 01:48:48,420
Of course there is extreme ownership.

1829
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:52,470
The first book that I wrote with my
brother Leif Babin about the combat

1830
01:48:52,471 --> 01:48:56,370
leadership principles that we learned
on the battlefield and how you can apply

1831
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:57,690
them to your business and life,

1832
01:48:57,691 --> 01:49:00,690
and we followed that book up with a
book called the dichotomy of leadership,

1833
01:49:01,080 --> 01:49:03,180
which,
well,

1834
01:49:03,181 --> 01:49:07,530
some people are saying it's better
than extreme ownership. Read it,

1835
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:09,960
judge for yourself.
Tell us what you think.

1836
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:13,860
I think if you read extreme ownership,

1837
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:18,060
when you read dichotomy,
a lot of things are gonna fall into place.

1838
01:49:18,150 --> 01:49:19,480
A lot of little,
little,

1839
01:49:19,810 --> 01:49:23,100
little things that you didn't quite
have it that we you wanted it to be.

1840
01:49:23,101 --> 01:49:25,110
When you read dichotomy, it's
going to come into place. Also,

1841
01:49:25,111 --> 01:49:27,600
we've got echelon front,
which is our leadership consultancy.

1842
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:32,220
We solve problems through leadership.
That's what we do. It's me, Leif Babin,

us to come work with your company, the,

1846
01:49:49,120 --> 01:49:51,190
we got three musters this year.

1847
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:55,060
All musters ever have sold out.

1848
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:59,020
These are going to sell out well as well.

1849
01:49:59,410 --> 01:50:02,440
There's May 23rd and 24th in Chicago,

1850

September 19th and 20th in Denver,

December 4th and fifth in Sydney,
Australia.

1852
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:13,510

you want to come to these things,

1853
01:50:13,750 --> 01:50:17,560

I had friends,

1854
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:21,340
friends that said, hey, you know
what? I didn't really sign up.

1855
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:24,150
Can you just give me a couple of
tickets? And I'm like, actually no,

1856
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:28,690
I can because we, we can't fit
any more people in the building.

1857
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:33,760
So No.
So I can't help you if you wait too long,

1858
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:38,620
register,
get on it early enough online.

of extreme ownership.

1863
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:57,340
If you want them to understand the
fundamental laws of combat that we used on

1864
01:50:57,341 --> 01:51:01,870
the battlefield and that we have
now talked to scores of businesses.

1865
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:05,920
If you want to have that training,

it's everything and it's awesome.
So check out [inaudible] dot com

1870
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:29,140
also ETF Overwatch where we are connecting
proven leaders from the SPEC ops and

1871
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:34,141
combat aviation communities with
companies in the civilian sector.

1872
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:37,930
Now here's the thing.
You might think,

1873
01:51:37,931 --> 01:51:40,690
well I've got to hire somebody
that's experienced in this industry.

1874
01:51:41,050 --> 01:51:43,180
That's a good thought.
I understand where you're coming from.

1875
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:48,690
What I recommend you try is instead of
hiring a person that has experienced in

1876
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:49,984
the industry,

1877
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:54,100
has hire somebody that has experience
in something more important that is

1878
01:51:54,101 --> 01:51:56,560
leadership.
You can teach them on,

1879
01:51:56,561 --> 01:52:00,100
they can learn very quickly the industry
that you are bringing them into.

1880
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:04,750
What you can't teach someone and would
you can't give them as 20 years, 25 years,

1881
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:09,751
22 years of leadership experience in
the most high stakes business there is.

1882
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:16,370
And that is war,
so go to EDF,

1883
01:52:16,390 --> 01:52:21,390
overwatch.com if you want to hire
someone like that or if you are in that

1884
01:52:23,561 --> 01:52:23,861
position,

1885
01:52:23,861 --> 01:52:28,510
if you're a vet and you want to look to
get placed into a company that's looking

1886
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:29,630
for leadership Efo,

1887
01:52:29,660 --> 01:52:34,660
overwatch.com and if you want to spend
even more time with Echo Charles and

1888
01:52:36,611 --> 01:52:41,611
myself because for some reason you think
500 hours of podcasts isn't enough for

1889
01:52:42,701 --> 01:52:45,980
you. We are out there. We are
lurking on the inner webs on Twitter,

1890
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,620
on Instagram and on Facebook.

1891
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,280
Okay,

1892
01:52:50,280 --> 01:52:54,330
bookie,
Mohan Echo is adequate.

1893
01:52:54,331 --> 01:52:56,190
Charles and Imr,

1894
01:52:56,190 --> 01:53:00,780
Jocko Willink and thanks to all the
people in uniform for your service.

1895
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:02,820
That's our military personnel.

1896
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:07,980
Also our police and law enforcement,
correctional officers,

1897
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:13,140
border patrols, all first responders
and tonight especially the firefighters,

1898
01:53:13,141 --> 01:53:14,400
paramedics, EMT, yes,

1899
01:53:14,670 --> 01:53:19,670
who face suffering and death on a daily
basis and they learn how to handle it.

1900
01:53:21,570 --> 01:53:25,890
They learn how to stay balanced. They
learn how to detach, but not too much.

1901
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:31,220
Thanks for all of you for providing us
the freedom and security that we enjoy

1902
01:53:33,090 --> 01:53:35,550
every day.
And to everyone else that's listening,

1903
01:53:36,900 --> 01:53:41,900
you have ideas and you have
dreams and you have vision,

1904
01:53:43,351 --> 01:53:46,380
and that's cool.
That's awesome.

1905
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:51,210
But none of that means
anything unless you execute.

1906
01:53:53,140 --> 01:53:57,340
So execute, move forward, take
action. And you know what?

1907
01:53:57,341 --> 01:54:00,250
Maybe your idea works and maybe
it doesn't. And if it doesn't,

1908
01:54:00,251 --> 01:54:04,990
then try another one. And maybe none of
them will ever work. And that's fine,

1909
01:54:04,991 --> 01:54:08,440
because in the end, at
a minimum, you know,

1910
01:54:08,441 --> 01:54:13,300
at least you went out there
and got after it.

1911
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:17,550
So until next time,

1912
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,540
this is echo and Jocko out.
