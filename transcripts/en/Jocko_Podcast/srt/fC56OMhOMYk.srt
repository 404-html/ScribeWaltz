1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,640
This is Jocko podcast number
48 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,773
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,673
Yeah.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,300
We found general Custer on the bluffs
and near him lay the bodies of 11 of his

5
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:23,170
officers as a tribute to his bravery.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,890
The Indians had not mutilated general
Custer and he lay as if asleep,

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,900
but all the other men had been most
brutally mangled and had been stripped of

8
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:36,834
their clothing.

9
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,090
Yeah.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:42,680
Many of their skulls had been crushed in
eyes, had been torn from their sockets,

11
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,860
hands, feet, arms, legs,

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,200
and noses had been wrenched off.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,070
Many had their flesh cut in strips the
entire length of their bodies and there

14
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:59,261
were others whose limbs were closely
perforated with bullet holes showing that

15
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:04,811
the torture had been inflicted while
the wretched victims were yet alive.

16
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,400
There were 29 enlisted men missing from
the field of blood and they undoubtedly

17
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,450
had been taken prisoners and perished
at the steak while the Indians were

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:21,451
celebrating their scalp dance on the
night of the 25th in sight of my camp,

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,870
mine almost at Custer's feet was young.

20
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:32,871
Read a nephew of the generals who had
been visiting him at Fort Lincoln and who

21
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:38,601
had pleaded to go on the campaign where
this handsome lad of 19 met such an

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,670
untimely fate
within a few feet of the general lay,

23
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:47,940
his two brothers,
Boston and Tom.

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,970
There wasn't a whole army, no more
popular man than gallon. Tom Custer.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,340
He was young,
handsome,

26
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,490
a prince of good fellows and full of
that bravery that even characterized the

27
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:02,994
coasters.

28
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,270
He had served with distinction during
the war and it fought frequently before,

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,270
been engaged in Indian fights.

30
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,970
As we approached him,

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,260
we were horrified to see that his body
had been opened in his heart torn out.

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,061
Thus,

33
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:28,061
I know that the vengeance of rain in
the face had been at work several years

34
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:29,840
before.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,460
Rain in the face had murdered two white
men on of our forte and afterwards

36
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:36,350
boasted of it in the reservation.

37
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,950
He was arrested and brought
to trial by Tom Koster,

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,220
but before the time appointed
for his case at arrived,

39
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,080
the wily Indian had escaped sending back
word to captain Tom that he would be

40
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:50,370
revenged by cutting out his captors heart.

41
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,800
Okay.

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Rain in the face kept his
word by literally tearing
out the heart of young Tom

43
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:03,670
Koster near these three brothers
and they're boyish nephew lay there

44
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:08,270
brother-in-law, lieutenant Calhoun,
who had fallen on the skirmish line.

45
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,680
Costumers command was
completely annihilated,

46
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,550
not one of his men escaping.

47
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,490
Good Evening Echo. Good
evening, not right. There is

48
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,150
an excerpt from a book called,
I fought with Custer,

49
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,680
which is the story of Charles Wind off
who was a young private that fought with

50
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:43,961
one of the other companies in the
same Seventh Cavalry Regiment.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,720
That general George Custer led

52
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,230
general George Custer,

53
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,650
who was killed at the battle of little
big horn where he fought the native

54
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,261
Americans,

55
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:02,261
including our friend wouldn't leg or
we heard from on podcasts 45 but the

56
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:11,570
opening section that I just read wasn't
actually written by pro private wind off

57
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,090
it is a section of an account that is
written by a guy named major reno who was

58
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:22,451
one of the leaders of one of the other
companies have men at the battle that

59
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,830
they include in this book.

60
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,520
This book called by fought with customer
and this was obviously a brutal battle.

61
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,630
And my goal as always,

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,130
I shouldn't say is always put my goal.

63
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,710
Yeah.

64
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,710
Well where I like to focus is not so much
on what details happen in the battle,

65
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:55,111
but what details happened with
the human nature in the battle,

66
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,260
the people, the leadership, the decisions.

67
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,070
And we got some good understanding about
the native American perspective from

68
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:06,064
wooden leg.

69
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,390
But now let's hear a little bit of
what it was like for the troopers.

70
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:18,300
And I know I use that term
on a fairly regular basis,

71
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,730
but that is a very specific term.

72
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,180
Okay.

73
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,920
In a cavalry unit,
this,

74
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,660
and at this time a cavalry unit was
literally units that they ride horses,

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,560
you know, that's what
it is. Mounted Cavalry,

76
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,430
a soldier in a calvary unit is
specifically called a trooper.

77
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,970
And the word nowadays,
it,

78
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,660
it actually is used to cover a
lot of different people. You know,

79
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,270
armored units use it,
airborne units. You know,

80
00:05:48,271 --> 00:05:51,690
when you think of an airborne unit
parachuters, you think of a paratrooper,

81
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,820
trooper being the key word there.
Obviously there's police state troopers.

82
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,650
And then obviously there's people
that listen to this podcast,

83
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,480
but that is what we have here.
The cavalry unit,

84
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,630
and this in particular was the Seventh
Cavalry Regiment and the trooper,

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,601
like I said,

86
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:19,601
is this guy private Charles wind off
who's actually born in Germany and

87
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,010
emigrated to the United States.

88
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,340
He became a cobbler like his
dad knew what a cobbler is.

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,010
People fix shoes.
People who fix shoes and you know what,

90
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:34,760
he fixed shoes for awhile, but he didn't
like fixing shoes, so what do you do?

91
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,180
Join the army and he ended up
fighting in some of the Indian wars.

92
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,320
He actually received the medal of honor
for his actions at little big horn and

93
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,780
we'll get into those,

94
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,200
but let's hear what private
wind off has to say.

95
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,890
I'm going to the book,

96
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,450
June 25th,

97
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,100
1946 was the last time I saw him alive.

98
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,270
Two days later I looked down on him
lying in the white in the Montana son.

99
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,780
That would have been June 27th,

100
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,260
1876 and the following day I helped him.

101
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,800
I helped bury him and his brother,
Captain Tom Koster.

102
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,070
They were putting in graves
alongside one another.

103
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,930
It was hard digging there on that high
ridge that bordered little big horn.

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,810
It's a long time to remember
details and little things,

105
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,680
but when you've been thinking
back on them all those years,

106
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,720
they don't fade away as easily as
you might think. They're like burrs.

107
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,180
They stick in your mind.

108
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,460
People call it the Koster massacre.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,070
It wasn't any massacre.

110
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:06,110
It was a straight hard fight and the five
troops who were with Costa simply got

111
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,200
cut to ribbons and every
last white man destroyed.

112
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,820
I say every last white man because there
were one or two crow scouts who claim

113
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:19,821
they saw the start of the fight and then
skedaddled a crow Indian named curly

114
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,360
said he escaped from the battlefield
by putting a blanket over his head and

115
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,920
pretending he was a wounded sue.

116
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:26,590
Okay.

117
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,460
I don't know whether there's any truth in
that or not. I never quite believed it.

118
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,670
There's been all kinds of
stories about that battle.

119
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,770
Even the men who were with Ben Teen and
Reno and live to tell the tale didn't

120
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:42,670
come anywhere near telling the same
stories about what they did and what they

121
00:08:42,671 --> 00:08:43,504
saw.

122
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,570
Some of them wanted to make heroes out
of themselves or of their officers.

123
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,420
I only had one pair of eyes,

124
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,230
so of course all I can
tell is what I saw myself.

125
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,480
If it is something that I only heard,
I'll be sure to mark it down as that.

126
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,790
Interestingly,

127
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,000
this is something that we used to see
all the time in that you go out on an

128
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:12,600
operation and when things happen to guys,

129
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,360
almost nobody will see the same thing.

130
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:19,830
Everybody sees some things a little bit
different and it can be difficult to

131
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:24,120
figure out what's actually accurate.
So that's,

132
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,340
and he's, he's going back
when he's writing this book,
I think it's been 70 years.

133
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,040
So when he's being interviewed
and he's writing this book,

134
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:35,010
it's been 70 years and he's saying
he still remembers the details,

135
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,010
but 70 years is a long time,
long time.

136
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
And the characters that
he just brought up,

137
00:09:41,161 --> 00:09:46,161
Ben teen is a guy that he worked for
and Reno was one of the other majors.

138
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,430
And another word that they use here
is truth. Now this is a word that's,

139
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,680
we think of it as an individual.
Hey,

140
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:55,680
there's a trooper over there or
that there's a troop. It actually,

141
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,110
it actually is another term that means
basically like a company of guys.

142
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:04,080
Now you can see it small and
this is more like a platoon.

143
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,910
What they're talking about
would be considered a platoon,

144
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,140
I would say from reading.
Um,

145
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,650
he had five troops with him. Koster
did that got killed, you know, call.

146
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:15,180
How about 200 guys?

147
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,330
And so we're not talking about a
massive group of people in each troop,

148
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,090
but that's what they're talking about.
20 guys per trooper actually.

149
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:26,790
What'd that be?
40 guys per troop for five.

150
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,790
And so that's what they're talking
when they refer to the troops.

151
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,210
And even they use the word interchangeably
and sometimes they'll refer to as

152
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:36,600
companies and sometimes they say troops.
Yeah.

153
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,830
So um,

154
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,890
guilt going back to the book here when
he's an initially in the army and what

155
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:49,470
they're doing and he talks about
what they were doing at this time.

156
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,380
It was pretty dull soldiering
down there in the south,

157
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,030
the regiment was broken up into companies
or small battalions and our job was to

158
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:02,031
smash the Klu Klux Klan and run
down elicit whiskey distillers.

159
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,580
It wasn't much fun for
energetic spirited young men.

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,920
And now he's going to talk a little bit
about the seventh cavalry. As I say,

161
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:17,870
the seventh cavalry was only seven
years old in 1873 but it had a fine

162
00:11:17,871 --> 00:11:21,230
reputation. Everybody in the
country knew general Custer

163
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,680
and Andy and he was always bragging about
what a fine fighting regimen he had.

164
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,630
He was supposed to be the best Indian
fighter in the American army in the civil

165
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:32,170
war.

166
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,910
They'd called them the boy
general and he'd been a dashing,

167
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,110
popular figure.

168
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,790
The regimen had spent its first four
years of its life on the Kansas Plains and

169
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,410
an Indian Indian territory.

170
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:49,770
The old timers in the outfit could sure
tell some blood curling Indian stories.

171
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,440
They used to say that it
was worse straight death to
get captured by the Indians

172
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,820
because you would be slowly tortured
until you gave up the ghost.

173
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,190
They told all of us young soldiers,

174
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,930
if we were ever wounded in an Indian fight
and left behind and endanger of being

175
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:08,764
captured,

176
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,330
that we must save our last
cartridge to blow out our brains.

177
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,350
So that's an interesting point.
When we remember,

178
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:22,351
wouldn't leg said that all the guys in
costers group ended up killing themselves

179
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,160
and maybe that's that.
That very well might have happened

180
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,580
or at least some of them.
Yeah.

181
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,911
Back to the book.

182
00:12:34,911 --> 00:12:39,560
By the spring of 1873 the plains
Indians had been largely debased,

183
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,221
beaten,

184
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:43,100
and driven to the great reservations
that have been allotted to the various

185
00:12:43,101 --> 00:12:46,580
tribes. It had not been a
deliberate government policy,

186
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,910
but it had been cruelly,
but had been a cruelly effective one.

187
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:55,400
Treaty after treaty had been broken by
the relentless pressure of white men and

188
00:12:55,401 --> 00:13:00,170
their civilization constantly pushing
against the ineffective resistance of the

189
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,900
red men. Now, when again,

190
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,250
the Indians had struck back and
as a rule, they're angry, angry,

191
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:09,350
flare ups were put down by the army,

192
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,720
and then new and drastic treaties would
be made and more land taken from them in

193
00:13:14,721 --> 00:13:15,554
punishment.

194
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,320
The ink would hardly be dry on these new
government commitments before the white

195
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:26,030
pressure would be resumed. Intrusions
made. And once again, the bewildered,

196
00:13:26,031 --> 00:13:30,260
enraged Indians would strike back only
to be subdued by the army and harsh

197
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:35,120
penalties imposed on them.
It was a deadly and vicious cycle.

198
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,920
The Indian found himself
whirling endlessly in.

199
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,960
So that's reminds me of a lot
of conflicts where you have,

200
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,700
you have these things
happen. You know the, the,

201
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,050
the white man is putting
pressure on the Indians.

202
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,620
The Indians don't know what's going on,
so they lash out a little bit.

203
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:01,730
What are the white man do
then go in there, smash them,
take more land from them,

204
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,900
compress the more.

205
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,970
Eventually there's another lash out
and you just get this vicious cycle,

206
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,300
vicious cycle.
In 1864,

207
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,800
uh,
uh,

208
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,800
certain kernel Shillington with a regimen
of volunteer Colorado Cav cavalry had

209
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:25,220
suddenly moved against a large encampment
of Cheyanne's and indiscriminately

210
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:27,560
killed some 300 Indians.

211
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,580
The massacre unquestionably had turned
many Luke warm Indians into out and out

212
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:39,620
hostiles. This bitterness of
the Cheyanne's was inflamed.

213
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,290
Two or three years later
when costs are led,

214
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:47,291
his newly formed seventh cavalry against
the black kettle and his band in a

215
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:52,661
sudden attack against their sleeping
village on Washita in Texas,

216
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,710
the Cheyanne's who are recognized as the
most brilliant Indian fighters of the

217
00:14:57,711 --> 00:15:02,711
planes never forgave either Custer or
his seventh cavalry for this whirling

218
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,310
attack on their sleeping
village in the dead of winter.

219
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,840
Oh, another big. Yeah. So, uh, you know,

220
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,990
atrocities on both sides,
clearly,

221
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:21,380
I'll talk a little bit
about those as well.

222
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:26,381
But one of the biggest atrocities beyond
the killing of the Indians themselves,

223
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:30,200
that native Americans themselves and those
types of atrocities was what they did

224
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:34,730
with the buffalos because the white
man was coming and killing all the

225
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:37,850
buffaloes.
And I'll go to the book here.

226
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:42,851
Once the buffalo around whose existence
the whole economy of the Indian was

227
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:45,800
based,
was killed off the nomads,

228
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:50,540
had nothing to do but submit to government
control and become agency Indians,

229
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,960
degraded whiskey crazed and beaten only
the various tribes of the Su and the

230
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:02,000
fighting Cheyenne is refused to be
broken on the wheel of civilization.

231
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,680
A few determine leaders such
as sitting bull, crazy horse,

232
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,560
gall American horse to moon,

233
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,830
white bull spotted eagle and chief honk.

234
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,940
Stubbornly held out against the threats
and blandishments of the whites.

235
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,510
But by the spring of 1873 they were
beginning to be branded as hostiles.

236
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,230
So that's something that
I didn't focus on enough.

237
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,360
When I talked about how the Sioux
and the Cheyenne kind of faded well,

238
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:36,170
one of the main reasons that
they faded was, you know, again,

239
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,870
they gave up their guns at
a certain point, but we,

240
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,710
the white man had decimated the buffaloes.

241
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,220
And so that was their main way of
survival. If you remember from wooden leg,

242
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,241
that's where they lived.

243
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:50,840
They lived in shelters that were made
from buffalo skins and obviously they ate

244
00:16:50,841 --> 00:16:54,260
buffalo all the time. They
hunted buffalo, they ate them.

245
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,910
They made their weapons out of Buffalo.

246
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,110
Everything that they did was with Buffalo.
Yeah,

247
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,870
so when the white man came in and killed
all the buffalo, that put them in a,

248
00:17:02,871 --> 00:17:04,640
in a real precarious situation.

249
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,870
Now we go back to the book talking to a
little bit about what it was like being

250
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:12,980
the cavalry at this time.

251
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:18,530
Each man would look after his own horse
and we'd usually give him a little

252
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,300
exercise and a good rub down.

253
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,570
A trooper thought a lot
of his mouth at a cavalry,

254
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:27,410
men would have to be a pretty mean.
It would have to be pretty mean.

255
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:31,430
Who didn't take good care of his horse.
If we got a good chance, we'd steal them.

256
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:34,580
A little extra oats or
hay for individual mounts.

257
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,380
My horse at this time was named pig.
That wasn't his real name,

258
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,030
but I called him that because nothing
could keep him from rolling in a mud hole

259
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,660
when he was being watered.
After we'd come in from a long ride.

260
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,540
He was fast and he could show his heels
to most of the horses and the regimen.

261
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:53,070
I fought a lot of them,

262
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,390
but the army condemned him after we'd
been beaten in the Dakota country.

263
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,170
A year or two after we'd been in
the Dakota country, a year or two,

264
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,940
I'll tell you later about the horse.
I rode in the battle of little big horn,

265
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,190
but one more thing about pig.

266
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,300
Two or three years after the army
sold him, I saw him in a contractor,

267
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:18,270
six horse team and the black hills.
He looked so porn abused.

268
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,970
I'd have bought them from
that contractor on the spot,

269
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:25,770
but I didn't have the money. I went
up to him and tested him. He knew me.

270
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:30,420
All right. He nickered and looked at me
as much to say, come on please Charlie,

271
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,530
get me out of here.

272
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,940
I had written old pig thousands
of miles and more than once,

273
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:39,780
he had saved my life at pretty
near cried when I saw him.

274
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,370
That time in the black hills.

275
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,050
Big Connection and you know,

276
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:51,820
we see that nowadays with the guys that
work with dogs and the the military

277
00:18:51,821 --> 00:18:56,740
working dogs, which are awesome animals
and those guys get major connect,

278
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,360
majorly connected to those dogs.
So she's like horse where it's just,

279
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,410
there's a lot of times where
it's just you and him in the,

280
00:19:03,411 --> 00:19:05,830
in the first year writing situation,
you know, it's just you and him.

281
00:19:05,831 --> 00:19:07,660
It's like Dang,
you go through so much together,

282
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:09,940
up stones and then for sure you could,

283
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,730
I can't even imagine the
emotion of that situation. Yeah.

284
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,260
Back to the book, it was at the Yankton
that I first saw general Custer.

285
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,210
He was not far from six feet tall.
He must have weighed around 180 pounds.

286
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,270
He was energetic and it was
mighty hard to wear him out.

287
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,050
I've heard people say that
when he was at West Point,

288
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,640
he was the second strongest man there.
As I remember him at the time,

289
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:40,780
he was wearing long hair or something
like buffalo bill used to where you had a

290
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:44,920
big wide Brynn,
western hat and long military mustache,

291
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,430
his hair and mustache where
yellow Tawney colored.

292
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,700
I suppose would be the
right way to describe them.

293
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,700
He had on high Willington boots,

294
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,720
they were the kind that came up to the
knees with the front three or four inches

295
00:19:58,721 --> 00:20:02,380
higher than the back. They were
popular among officers at the time.

296
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,970
General customer wasn't the
kind to mix freely with the men.

297
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:12,670
In those years there was quite a gulf
between the officers and the enlisted men.

298
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,180
Some of the officers were friendly
and easy going with their troopers,

299
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,600
but there was always a Gulf Kuster
struck me as being aloof and removed.

300
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,433
No did

301
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,440
it got to be gossip among the troopers
that some of the officers didn't set so

302
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:35,710
very well with the general,
my captain,

303
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,060
Colonel Ben Teen. So there's something
that nurses like, I got to point this out.

304
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,520
Some of these including general Custer,

305
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,460
these guys had been promoted
during the civil war.

306
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,940
It's so general become a
general during the civil war,

307
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,730
but after the war they got demoted.

308
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,430
They got put back down in rank
cause they shrank the armies,

309
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,540
they shrank the army.
And so for instance,

310
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,660
general Custer at this time was he
had been a general in the civil war.

311
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,740
Now all of a sudden he's a colonel,

312
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,720
so he'd got put down in rank and it's the
same with, he's talking about his boss.

313
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,620
Um, uh, uh, wind offs.

314
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:16,340
Boss Windows boss was a
guy named captain Ben Teen,

315
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,730
but they call him colonel bending cause
he was a colonel during civil war.

316
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,583
[inaudible]

317
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,350
my captain Colonel Benton was one of
those folks who didn't belong to the

318
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,000
generals inner circle,

319
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,540
I suppose you could say about
half the officers in the regiment,

320
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:30,550
we're close to Costa
and the rest were not.

321
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,120
I repeat that Ben teen was not distinct,

322
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:36,520
was distinctly not an intimate of Custer.

323
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,490
I heard all sorts of
reasons why that was true.

324
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,410
There was one report that Ben teen,

325
00:21:41,411 --> 00:21:45,320
it turned bitter because Costa had
pulled out after the battle of the washy,

326
00:21:45,321 --> 00:21:47,290
didn't December,

327
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:51,790
1868 in Kansas and it left a major
Elliot and 17 men to their fate.

328
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,930
A day or two later they were all found,
killed,

329
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,910
scalped and mutilated.

330
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,920
There was a story that Custer and Ben
Teen had some hard words over that,

331
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,760
but of course,
I don't know how true that old story is.

332
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,210
So there you go. Ben Teen thought
custard, let some guys hanging out to dry,

333
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,380
had confronted him about it and
cost or didn't like that at all,

334
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,320
and now they got some stuff
that they're at odds about.

335
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And speaking of that event where
these 17 men were killed in this book,

336
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,370
they have an exer that's a letter from
an army officer that got published in a

337
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:42,170
newspaper about that event,
and I'm going to read it.

338
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,280
The bodies were found in a small circle,

339
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
stripped as naked as wind born and frozen,
stiff.

340
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,400
Their heads had been battered in and some
of them had been entirely chopped off.

341
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,360
Some of them had the Adam's
apple cut out of their throats.

342
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,740
Some had their hands and feet caught
off and nearly all had been horribly

343
00:23:03,741 --> 00:23:07,970
mangled in a way.
Delicacy forbids me to mention.

344
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah,

345
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,200
they lay scarcely two miles
from the scene of the fight.

346
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,183
Okay.

347
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:18,210
Who can describe the
feeling of that brave band?

348
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,270
As with anxious hearts beating,

349
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,530
they strained their yearning eyes in
the direction of whence the help should

350
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,364
come.

351
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,850
What must've been the despair that when
all hopes of soccer died out nerve,

352
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:37,581
they're stout arms to do and
die round and round rush.

353
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:42,750
The red feens smaller and
smaller shrinks the circle.

354
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,900
But the aim of that devoted gallon not
of heroes is steadier than ever and the

355
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:52,190
death. How of the murderous
red skin is more frequent,

356
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,840
but on a calm and masses
grim with glittering lance
and one long loud exalting

357
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:05,801
whoop as if the gates of hell had opened
and loose the whole infernal host.

358
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,450
Okay,

359
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,430
well directed volley from their trustee
carbines make some of the miscreants

360
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:16,840
real and fall, but their death rattles
are drowned in the greater den.

361
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,200
Okay?

362
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Soon every voice in that
little band is steel is death,

363
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,630
but the hellish work of the savages is
scarce begun and their engine newies are

364
00:24:28,941 --> 00:24:33,941
taxed to invent barbarities to practice
on the bodies of the fallen brave.

365
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,153
Yeah.

366
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,850
Some psychological warfare going on there.
You clearly,

367
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,150
we know that the troopers at this time do.

368
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,710
You don't want to get
captured by the Indians.

369
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,400
And the reason that they think that
is events like this mutilated bodies,

370
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,430
everyone had killed.
No quarter given.

371
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,560
Now going to what some of
the other officers were like,

372
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:09,390
I'm gonna talk about Captain Ben Teen.

373
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,870
Here's what captain Benton
was like back to the book.

374
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:16,620
Most of the time we were in the field.
Captain venting commanded a squadron.

375
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:20,670
Usually you'd have one or two
companies besides his own h company.

376
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,250
He was a wonderful officer.

377
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,360
He let the first sergeant pretty
much run the company. Hmm.

378
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,940
Little decentralized command going on.

379
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:33,690
He wasn't always interfering
and running the details,

380
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:36,630
so he wasn't getting in the weeds.
He wasn't a micromanager.

381
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,020
I served under Ben Team for 12 full years,

382
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,630
lacking only throws three days.

383
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,250
One of the best descriptions of Captain
Benton is that penned by the late major

384
00:25:47,251 --> 00:25:52,251
general Hugh l Scott on page
454 of his interesting book,

385
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,680
some memoirs of a soldier.

386
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,750
I found my model early
in captain Ben Teen,

387
00:26:00,751 --> 00:26:05,751
the idol of the seventh cavalry on the
Upper Missouri in 1877 who governed

388
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,710
mainly by suggestion.

389
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,160
In all the years I knew him,

390
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,750
I never once heard him raise his
voice to enforce his purpose.

391
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,123
Think about that.

392
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,080
Never once heard him raise his
voice to enforce his purpose.

393
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,920
He would sit by the open fire at night,
his bright,

394
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:30,000
pleasant face framed by a snow white
hair beaming with kindness and humor,

395
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:34,800
and often watched often I watched his
every movement to find out the secret of

396
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:39,300
his quiet, steady government
that I might go and govern.

397
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:42,420
Likewise,
for example,

398
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,510
if he to stay a few days in one camp,

399
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,780
he would say to his adjutant,
brewer,

400
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,790
don't you think we had better take up
our regular guard Mount Wallen camp?

401
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,860
And brewer always thought it
better and so did everyone else.

402
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,730
If he found this kindly manner,
manner was misunderstood,

403
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,040
then his iron hand would close quickly
down. But that was seldom necessary.

404
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:13,790
And then only with newcomers and
never twice with the same person.

405
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,310
So this is just complete example of
indirect leadership. Hey, don't you hey,

406
00:27:20,311 --> 00:27:22,050
echo, do anything to be good. If
we're going to stay in this camp,

407
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:26,400
we should put our, our camp guards
out. Hm. What do you think? Of course.

408
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:29,280
There you go. So you make it
happen. I didn't give you an order.

409
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,220
I actually let you get, get some ownership
of it. It's actually now your decision.

410
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,770
Not even my decision anymore.
You know,

411
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,740
that's a really good example
of some solid leadership.

412
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,623
Okay.

413
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,270
Here's what it was like
to be in the cavalry.

414
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,710
It was wonderful to be young and to be
riding into Indian country as part of the

415
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:51,140
finest regimen of cavalry in the world.

416
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,680
We,
we're mighty proud of the seventh.

417
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,160
It just didn't seem like
anything could ever happen to it.

418
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,700
Now I'm going to go through there.
They're riding out there,

419
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,800
they're working the plains,

420
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:14,660
and I'm going to go through a little
battle on the planes were customers and

421
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:18,920
charge general George Custer's in charge.
The general started,

422
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,720
so did the Indians.

423
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:24,740
They had a good start in general cost of
resolve not to pursue them too far away

424
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:27,770
from his men after a sharp short race.

425
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,150
He stopped on the plane keeping
well away from the suspicious woods.

426
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,500
When he stopped,
the Indian stopped.

427
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,910
It was evident that they would not
be so audacious without a conscious,

428
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,940
without a consciousness of
strength somewhere for ways
that are dark and tricks

429
00:28:47,331 --> 00:28:48,320
that are vain.

430
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,440
The even sue is almost as
peculiar as the heathen.

431
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:59,750
Cheney and I actually had to go in
and do a little research on that one.

432
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:05,110
There's a poem that it's about Chinese
migrant workers and interested.

433
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,470
You can go and read about this poem.
It's called the heathen shiny.

434
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,220
And if you read the poem,
you realize that

435
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,730
he's trying to describe that
they're playing cards with the,

436
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,190
a couple of the people working on the
train or plane cars or the Chinese guy,

437
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,950
and as they're playing cards,
they're,

438
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:30,470
they're kind of treating the
Chinese guy like he's ignorant,

439
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,150
but he's actually winning. And when they
accused him of cheating, there's a fight.

440
00:29:35,151 --> 00:29:38,000
And he was actually the white guy that
was cheating one of the other white guys

441
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:38,570
that was cheating.

442
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,210
So the guy that wrote the poem had the
poem with the intention of showing, Hey,

443
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,150
these people are smart
and they're trustworthy,

444
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,800
but because of the name it got
red and misinterpreted a lot.

445
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,790
The title of the poem.
Yep. Yeah. Then shiny,

446
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,330
not a very positive positive neighbor.

447
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,870
At least that's kind of what I did some
very quick research on that just to

448
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:05,800
figure it out what is all about and that's
sort of what I gathered after a quick

449
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:06,634
uh,

450
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,060
okay.

451
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:11,320
Quick research meaning I googled it and
read a few articles to figure out what

452
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:14,810
was going on in um,
in Hawaiian Pidgin.

453
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,350
When we see Japanese we say Japanese.

454
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,970
Portuguese is put Aggie Chinese,
Chinese man,

455
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,460
right. Be So maybe based on relationship
connection there. All right.

456
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,800
Back to the book.
This time the trick was indeed vein.

457
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,110
They were fighting with no novice.

458
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,540
As soon as general Custer
saw the Indian dodge,

459
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,260
which was to use these men as a
decoy to draw them into the woods,

460
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,370
he immediately sent his orderly back
to Captain Moylan to order a platoon to

461
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:49,580
dismount before the order could get back.

462
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,490
250 mounted Indians drawn
up in a line of battle,

463
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,920
came out of the woods
and find military style.

464
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:59,300
The seventh cavalry could hardly have
done it better with painted faces,

465
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,010
heads decorated with ribbons.
They sallied out with loud war.

466
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,780
Whoops. General Custer
putting more confidence in
the feet of his thoroughbred.

467
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:13,130
Then the voice of his rifle against
250 Indians turned back to his command

468
00:31:13,131 --> 00:31:16,280
calling out to his brother to
throw out a dismounted line.

469
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,820
Lieutenant Custer had anticipated the
order and was already dismounting as men.

470
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,430
That's awesome. So these guys were worked
together. He goes to give the order.

471
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,500
His brother's already on it. They ran
forward and took places in the grass.

472
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,090
The Indians open to heavy fire,

473
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:35,120
which was quickly answered by our
men with their sharp carbines,

474
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,570
Ena dismounted cavalry fight.

475
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,350
Every fourth man is usually
detailed to hold the horses.

476
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:47,300
But being short of fighting men and the
reserves being several miles back with

477
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:51,770
the train general Custer ordered every
six men only to hold the horses and the

478
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:53,360
rest to join the skirmish line.

479
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,430
The Indians having three times as larger
force and seeing the cavalry dismounted

480
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,660
followed their example and dismounted
from their advantage of numbers.

481
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,870
They were able to extend the skirmish
line clear around from river to river so

482
00:32:08,031 --> 00:32:13,031
as to enclose the cavalry in a semi circle
with the woods and the river at their

483
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:15,770
back.
They're getting flanked.

484
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,980
Finding though that the
horses were exposed to fire.

485
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,210
General Custer ordered them to
be led further into the timber.

486
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,493
Okay.

487
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,430
Now some other things take place and
I'm kind of fast forward a little bit

488
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:31,264
through the story.

489
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,230
The Indians having lost two men were more
cautious in their advance and finding

490
00:32:35,231 --> 00:32:39,070
that they could not with their heavy
rifles, drive the cavalry into the woods,

491
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,270
had recourse to another favorite weapon.

492
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:47,000
They fired the grass in
four or five places, meaning
they set the grass on fire.

493
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,560
So you imagine you're hiding in the
grass and then also in their setting the

494
00:32:51,561 --> 00:32:54,080
grass on fire.
Fortunately,

495
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:58,360
there was little or no wind and the
grass was too short and too green to burn

496
00:32:58,361 --> 00:32:59,930
well else.

497
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:04,430
This new weapon might have proved
formidable indeed. The fire,

498
00:33:04,431 --> 00:33:05,060
however,

499
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,650
raised a blue curtain of smoke forming
a corner segment between the fighting

500
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:13,190
arcs failing in their attempt
to raise a great fire.

501
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,340
The red skins used this smoke line as
a mask for their rifles advancing under

502
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:24,500
cover of this curtain. They would
pour a volley at our line and retreat.

503
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,030
A little bit of cover move happening.

504
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,470
Our men soon discovered the dodge
and laid equal claim to the curtain.

505
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:35,060
The Indians abandoning this
position began to draw in their men.

506
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,570
Now general Custer said to Captain
Moylan led us mount and drive them off.

507
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:44,810
The men immediately mounted in
advanced as skirmishers on a trot.

508
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,810
Finding this was not fast enough.
A charge was ordered.

509
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,110
The men eager for the order gave a loud
yell and put their horses and do a full

510
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:55,580
gallop.
Nearly 300 number.

511
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,790
The site of 80 cavalry
men coming toward them,

512
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,370
like mad caps was too
much for the Indians.

513
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:04,760
They turned like sheep and
scattered in every direction.

514
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:14,140
Battles, battles on the
planes, small unit tactics.

515
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,480
Very similar to the small unit
tactics that are used today.

516
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:23,610
Throw [inaudible] we use smoke,
you smoking in Ramadi, throw smoke.

517
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:25,480
We had smoke grenades.
What do you use those for?

518
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,240
Set up a little curtain so people
can't see you when you're moving.

519
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,793
Hmm.

520
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,450
And you'll notice also there
were some aggressive action.

521
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:39,530
It's that aggressive action. Both,
both sides. When they got aggressive,

522
00:34:39,531 --> 00:34:43,310
they started doing better. When
you start getting, when the other,

523
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:46,070
when your opponent becomes the aggressor,
you start getting put on your heels.

524
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,630
Just gonna stay aggressive.
Default mode.

525
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:58,190
Now, uh, talking a little bit about what
it was like when they were back in camp.

526
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,420
So they weren't on the road all the time.

527
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:01,820
They weren't out in the plains all the
time. Sometimes they'd be back in camp.

528
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:07,060
They had there, they had bams, they had,
some of them had their wives there. Uh,

529
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,760
they had good food and you know,

530
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:14,930
basically good stuff going on.
They had pretty relaxed time,

531
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,850
but it was always,
let's prepare.

532
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,610
We're going back out in the field so
they're back out in the field here.

533
00:35:19,611 --> 00:35:24,260
General Custer who has used,
was writing ahead with a couple of troops,

534
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:29,240
came upon smoldering campfires that showed
the three Indian teepees had recently

535
00:35:29,241 --> 00:35:34,000
been there. He sent bloody knife ahead
with several Indian, so that bloody knife,

536
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,450
you're gonna hear his
voice throughout here.

537
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,050
Bloody knife was costers right hand
man. He was, he was an Indian Scout.

538
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,333
Hmm.

539
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,070
Soon the Gallup back with the information
that they had located the Indians

540
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:51,260
Custer's surrounded the little camp and
brought back four bucks with him to our

541
00:35:51,261 --> 00:35:52,094
camp.

542
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,340
The head was a minor chief named one Stapp
who squad was a daughter of red cloud

543
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,950
costs or promised them
food if they helped him.

544
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:04,910
But they seem to be in a hurry to
leave and before they could be checked,

545
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,750
they mounted their ponies and we're off.
Custer's sent troopers after them,

546
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,100
but the only one they could catch
and bring back was one stab.

547
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:15,980
He was told he would
be given all the bacon,

548
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,810
sugar and coffee that two ponies
could carry if he'd act as a guide.

549
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,340
He agreed.

550
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:28,400
So, uh, again,

551
00:36:28,401 --> 00:36:32,840
I guess the reason I wanted to bring
that up is it shows that those Indians

552
00:36:32,841 --> 00:36:36,770
working on both sides and it was Indians
that went from w back and forth between

553
00:36:36,771 --> 00:36:40,400
sites, depending on, you know,
depending on what the situation is,

554
00:36:40,401 --> 00:36:43,790
depending on how they got
bribed. But, and also, you know,

555
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:47,030
we know that there was wars
between the Indians, you know,

556
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:52,031
so that's why sometimes the Indians
teamed up with the soldiers,

557
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,390
the American troops and went and got
after it with them. Yeah, it is that,

558
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,330
is that because they got,
when you say bribe,

559
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:01,940
like they got kind of enticed
with civilization? Well, no,

560
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm talking about as a
straight up bribe right there.

561
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,650
They're talking to one stab and they say,
Hey, one step, will you help guide us?

562
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,900
Well, I don't know if I feel
comfortable at that. Okay,

563
00:37:08,901 --> 00:37:10,670
we'll give you all the bacon,
all the sugar,

564
00:37:10,671 --> 00:37:14,820
and all the coffee that you can carry on
two horses. He says, all right, cool, Huh?

565
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,550
Yeah.
And if they're warring,

566
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:19,760
you know that if that's kind of their
enemy and Elaine, right. You know? Yeah,

567
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,190
let's do it. Yeah. Maybe he was
just, maybe he was just getting, uh,

568
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,260
getting some food out of what he
would have already liked to do. Yeah.

569
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,500
And what is it that the enemy of my
enemy is my friend. There you go.

570
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,670
There you go. Now in the black hills,
they think that they find gold.

571
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:38,480
They think they find gold and the
black hills, and this was just a good,

572
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,340
a good common here about,

573
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,150
I guess you could say it's
about material desires.

574
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:49,310
Gold to most men means sudden wealth,
big times,

575
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,090
whiskey and gambling and women,

576
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,700
it means fortune and adventure
and all the things they never had.

577
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:02,510
The gold fever is like taking dope.

578
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,660
You're helpless when it strikes you.

579
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,110
Careful that you know that material greed.

580
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:18,090
I once read about how everyone who touched
an Egyptian kings tomb was doomed to

581
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:20,650
die.
A violent death.

582
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:26,140
Seems to me that the Indians must have
put some curse like that on the white men

583
00:38:26,141 --> 00:38:29,200
who first touched their sacred
black hills. At this time,

584
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:35,190
Custer got a lot of notoriety from his
black hills expedition and the discovery

585
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,410
gold,
but he never had any luck after that.

586
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,173
Okay,

587
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:45,803
now

588
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,560
we're getting just a cursory look at the
politics of what were happening at the

589
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:53,394
time.

590
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:59,280
An attempt was made that summer of 75
to buy the black hills from the Indians

591
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:01,470
and make legal this on slot,

592
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,240
but the Indians were no mood to believe
anything the commissioners told them and

593
00:39:06,241 --> 00:39:10,770
it was impossible to make a deal of any
kind of feeling of utter despair and

594
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:15,630
despondency cast its spell over.
Even the friendly reservation Indians,

595
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:20,700
maybe the radical thing sitting bull and
crazy horse and Gaul and two moons in

596
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:24,960
the other wild chiefs far back in the
buffalo lands around the powder and the

597
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,930
big horn we're preaching.
Maybe they made sense.

598
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,200
The free Indian was doomed. They were
all to be made reservation Indians.

599
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,040
That meant all the colorful
old life would be gone forever.

600
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,510
The buffalo hunts, the feasts,
the sun dances, the visiting,

601
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,870
and the pleasant horse stealing wars.

602
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,750
All of the old life would be no more.

603
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,810
Maybe those radical chiefs were right.

604
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,950
Maybe they'd all be better to make
one big battle against the whites.

605
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:01,820
It would be better to die a free Indian
then live as a degraded helpless treaty.

606
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:04,044
Indian.

607
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:09,890
So evident was the hostile feeling that
in the fall of 1875 that an order was

608
00:40:10,651 --> 00:40:14,550
submitted by the Commissioner
of Indian affairs, Edward P.

609
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,820
Smith to the secretary of
the interior xe Chandler,

610
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:22,350
who interned submitted to the
secretary of war general Belknap.

611
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,600
Subsequent communication from
the secretary of Interior
to the secretary of war

612
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:31,500
dated December 1st,
1875 read as follows.

613
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,110
I have the honor to inform you that I
have this day directed the commissioner of

614
00:40:37,111 --> 00:40:42,111
Indian affairs to notify said Indian
sitting bull and the others outside their

615
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:47,411
reservations that they must return to
the reservations before January 31st,

616
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,400
1876 and if they neglect
or refuse so to move,

617
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:58,170
they will be reported to the war
department as hostile Indians and that a

618
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:03,171
military force will be sent to compel
them to obey the order of the Indian

619
00:41:03,691 --> 00:41:04,524
department.

620
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,280
Okay.

621
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,620
There it is to compel them.
Yup.

622
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,740
There it is and how you
know that's that's that

623
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,440
you have to be wary of your
government having so much power.

624
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,533
Yeah.

625
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,870
And leaving yourself
defenseless in these situations.

626
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,960
I think we learned a lot from the Indians,

627
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,280
from the native Americans on that.

628
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:43,390
Back to the book general Custer was not
at four Abraham Lincoln when we arrived

629
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:46,970
there in late April,

630
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,760
1876 of course that arouse
a lot of talk and suspicion.

631
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:54,770
When you juggled all those rumors down,
you got about this.

632
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,000
We were soon to start a big expedition
up to Yellowstone to round up the

633
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:03,800
hostiles and drive them back to the
reservations if they would not go

634
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:07,040
peacefully,
we were to make good Indians out of them.

635
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,420
There was a lot of suspicious talk
going around all over the place.

636
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,920
Custer was still in the east,

637
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:17,921
so Custer had gone back to the east and
you could hear a hundred tales of how he

638
00:42:18,591 --> 00:42:23,591
was being kept away from the expedition
because he had got under the skin of

639
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,720
president grant.
A lot of,

640
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:29,330
a lot of the troopers
didn't much care for Custer,

641
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,340
but it looked as if major reno would
command the regimen if custard didn't

642
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:39,110
arrive and most of us didn't know or
care a great deal about Reno. Of course,

643
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:43,970
we knew that he had been a kernel of a
Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment at the end

644
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:44,840
of the civil war,

645
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:49,160
but he had never fought Indians and
he didn't seem to be very popular with

646
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:52,880
either the men or the officers.
If I remember correctly,

647
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:57,530
he was a west pointer and was three or
four years ahead of Custer who was pretty

648
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,950
clear that there wasn't much
love lost between the two men,

649
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:07,100
politics, total politics, and some of
those people in the civilian world,

650
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,500
they don't realize this stuff happens
all the time. It was politics,

651
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:12,890
crazy politics in the military, and
then just this kind of stuff right here.

652
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,900
Oh your senior to me.
Oh you,

653
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:18,230
you made the other guy mad and now we're
going to get pulled over to pull you

654
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:20,870
off this operation. I'm going to
let this guy go on the operation.

655
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,070
This is just so typical of the military,
unfortunately.

656
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,660
And you know what, it's not just simple.
The military, it's typical in any company,

657
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:31,010
any business,
any team.

658
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,770
There's always going to be these political
things that are happening. I mean,

659
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:37,610
occasionally you get to a great
organization that really limits that.

660
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:42,110
I shouldn't say it's everywhere, but
it's very, very common. And you know,

661
00:43:42,111 --> 00:43:45,140
someone just asked me on Twitter,
you know, hey, it's really political.

662
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,860
I'm not really good at at politics,
you know,

663
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,150
which is it something that I should
actually try and engage in and yes,

664
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:55,580
yes. It's going to, you have to,

665
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,790
if you're in an organization that's a
political organization and you want to

666
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,330
make things happen, you want
to implement changes. Yes.

667
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,200
Start figuring out how to play
those games. Oh, you don't.

668
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:07,430
You're not a political person.
Cool.

669
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:10,490
Become one because of what you want
to do is you want to do a good job.

670
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,700
You want to, you want to do good job
and whatever it is that you're doing,

671
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:18,530
and sometimes that requires that you
play those games. So play the Games,

672
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:22,490
get good at them.
Back to the book,

673
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,930
everything was uncertain in those
late April and early May days,

674
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:31,220
while the regiment was being whipped into
marching shape. We had a few recruits,

675
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:33,630
a bunch,
and a bunch of fresh young horses,

676
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,970
so there was plenty to do
to break in both of them.

677
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,950
One thing that people get wrong about
the recruits was that about half of the

678
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:45,951
hundred and 50 new men we had were men
who either had civil war experience or

679
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:48,120
had already served a five
year hitch in the army.

680
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:52,830
Most of the rest were plenty green,
a good many of them were German boys.

681
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,080
They made fine soldiers.
Once they were trained,

682
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,000
I think it was about May 10th that
general costs are suddenly showed up.

683
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,320
General Terry's with him. Terry was
of slight build and war whiskers.

684
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,850
He was a gentle kindly man who never
struggled her ward, nothing at all.

685
00:45:08,851 --> 00:45:13,650
Like the quick moving dashing young Custer
Terry was a brigadier general of the

686
00:45:13,651 --> 00:45:17,910
regular army and so he
ranked Custer by two grades.

687
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,530
Word ran around camp. The General Terry
was to command the whole expedition,

688
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,930
but the Koster was to
have his old regimen.

689
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,280
Costa was as happy as a
boy with a new red sled.

690
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,970
He put a lot of zip into us now coster
this political stuff that he's dealing

691
00:45:36,031 --> 00:45:39,840
with, um, it's still going on.

692
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,960
It's still happening and I'm not
going to go through the details of it,

693
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,510
but he who somehow seen as a,

694
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,200
as an agitator or an
enemy of president grant,

695
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,060
and so we actually gets ordered
off the two. He goes back out,

696
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,260
takes back over the regiment,
starts whipping people into shape.

697
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,490
He's going to work for General Terry
Grant. President grant says, no,

698
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:05,850
actually come back. You're
not, you don't get to do this.

699
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:11,600
And Koester decides he writes a dispatch
to be sent directly to the president of

700
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:16,230
United States.
It's kind of crazy.

701
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,160
We didn't do much communications with
the president from my task lists.

702
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,750
Here we go back to the book
and the, Oh wait, here's,

703
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,420
so here's what he actually sent.
Is that awesome?

704
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,770
That's what's beautiful about history.

705
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:36,771
This is what are actually sent and grant
grant president grant was a guy that

706
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:42,480
was, you know, went to west point as well.
He fought in the Mexican American war.

707
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:47,730
He retired after that,
retired from the army,

708
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:48,930
but then the civil war started,

709
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,260
so he went back in the army as a general
and he fought at Shiloh and Vicksburg

710
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,710
and actually general surrendered,
surrendered to

711
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,230
President Grant. So this guys, you know,

712
00:47:05,231 --> 00:47:08,500
a warrior and here's what you're going
to hear. Custer kind of appeal to that.

713
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:12,420
Hmm.
Here we go.

714
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:16,800
I have seen your order transmitted
through the general of the army directing

715
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:20,850
that I not be permitted to accompany
the expedition about to move against the

716
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:25,851
hostile Indians as my entire regiment
forms a part of the proposed expedition

717
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,000
and as I am the senior officer of the
regimen on duty in the department,

718
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,840
I respectfully but most
earnestly request that I,

719
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,740
while not allowed to go and
command of the expedition,

720
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,310
I may be permitted to serve
with my regimen in the field.

721
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:48,300
I appeal to you as a soldier to spare
me the humiliation of seeing my regimen

722
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,370
marched to meet the enemy and
I not to share. It's dangerous.

723
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,040
It was too much for the Herro.

724
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,220
The hero of App Apple Modix Custer
was to have back his beloved regimen.

725
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:09,120
So grant gives in and
says, okay, you can go,

726
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,340
you're not going to be in charge,
but you can go.

727
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:17,360
And so they roll out on this expedition
and here's the description of what that

728
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:20,911
felt like.

729
00:48:20,911 --> 00:48:25,200
You felt like you were somebody when
you were on a good horse with a car,

730
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:30,201
been dangling from its small leather ring
socket on your saddle and a Colt Army

731
00:48:30,601 --> 00:48:34,290
revolver strapped on your hip and a
hundred rounds of ammunition and your web

732
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,570
belt and your saddle pockets.

733
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,170
You were a cavalry men
of the seventh regiment.

734
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:45,840
You are part of a proud outfit that had
a fighting reputation and you were ready

735
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,240
for a fight or a frolic.

736
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,630
So these guys had some pretty
good morale rolling out.

737
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,890
They did some hard training when they
were in camp and now they're ready to get

738
00:48:55,891 --> 00:49:00,740
after. It talks a little bit about Costa.

739
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:01,850
He describes Costa,

740
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,760
I can almost see him
myself in my mind's eye.

741
00:49:05,761 --> 00:49:09,600
He was wearing a broad western hat
with a low crown and a wide brand brim.

742
00:49:09,601 --> 00:49:10,890
It was grayish and color.

743
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:16,140
He'd had his long yellow
hair cut just before we left.

744
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:22,860
And he had on a buckskin suit with fringe.
He had two short bill barreled,

745
00:49:22,861 --> 00:49:27,150
bulldog revolvers and a Remington
sporting rifle carried in a scabbard.

746
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,610
It's my recollection that he carried a
hunting knife in a fringed buck skin case.

747
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,380
So, uh, that's, I mean, you know,

748
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,330
straight up rock and roll stars of
the 70s war fringe on their outfits.

749
00:49:42,331 --> 00:49:46,290
Right. So Costa was a, he's
a, he's a character, right?
He's definitely a character.

750
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:52,860
Back to the book, when the regiment
was formed in Kansas in 1866,

751
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:53,790
the general that went,

752
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:58,791
the general went to a lot of trouble
to have each troop mounted on distinct

753
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:02,610
colors. I thought this was
awesome. So I included it.

754
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,200
He's talking about what color horses
they had and each troop had a,

755
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,450
had a specific colored horse,

756
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:12,510
I can still call them off
even at this late date.

757
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,340
H my own troop road blood bays,
B,

758
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:21,660
d I n l also were mounted on bays.

759
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:22,590
C,

760
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:27,590
G and K had Searles a had Cole
blacks and Lieutenant Edge Lilly's.

761
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:31,070
Each troop had graze.

762
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,880
We used to call e the band box.

763
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:38,600
Troop m troop was the only
truth that had mixed colors.

764
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,840
The whole band road,
white horses.

765
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,440
I remember the drummer had a horse that
would run away every time he mounted him,

766
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,210
except when he put his drum on it.

767
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,810
Then that old horse would
stand still as a wooden horse.

768
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,810
It was a fine regiment right enough.

769
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,490
And it wasn't a man in it who didn't
believe it was the greatest cavalry outfit

770
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,680
in the entire United States army.

771
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:06,040
That, that, that actually is when I,

772
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,600
when I hear about these guys
talking about the horses,

773
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:12,601
we actually had little relationships
like that with our Humvees.

774
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,190
We'd name them. Yeah. We named our
Humvees. Yeah. We named our Humvees,

775
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:21,820
various names. Uh, we used to have,

776
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:25,570
when we used to do a lot more water
work before the war started, we would,

777
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,370
we actually named our outboard
motors and they had little by, uh,

778
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,590
one of my, the guy that handled the
outboard motors in my second platoon.

779
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,930
He was all into it. And, uh,
his nickname was Zulu, Zulu.

780
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,630
He was all into these motors and he had,

781
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:47,920
every motor had a name and he kept these
detailed bog books on how many hours

782
00:51:47,921 --> 00:51:49,150
and when the maintenance was done,
all that.

783
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,840
And when we came back from one deployment
and we were going to go do another

784
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:57,100
deployment, we came back, they said, hey,
you know, you guys, guess what? Good News.

785
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:00,820
We got all new motors and we're
going to issue you. Whatever it was.

786
00:52:00,821 --> 00:52:03,460
We had an eight outboard
motors. Yeah. Hey,

787
00:52:03,461 --> 00:52:05,350
well we're gonna give you all
new mood or at motors, you know,

788
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:09,100
common turn yours in and we'll
send those off to wherever.

789
00:52:09,101 --> 00:52:13,810
Get repaired are going to go into the
garbage can. And you know, it was lucid.

790
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,550
He said, I want the new motors. I got
my motors. I know where they've been.

791
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:22,420
I know their personalities. The
voters have personalities. Well,

792
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:28,300
the motors at personalities and motor
analogies. Yeah, they had personalities.

793
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:29,980
Yeah. Motor nowadays. And

794
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:36,370
he wanted to make sure he had a
relationship with those motors.

795
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:39,200
And you want to give them up.
Going back to the book, they're,

796
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,870
they're starting to be out on patrol.

797
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:42,790
And they're marching up
what's called the Rosebud

798
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:48,460
h and the five remaining troops headed
down the powder and eventually arrived at

799
00:52:48,461 --> 00:52:49,750
the southern bank of the Yellowstone.

800
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,430
The wagons had a tough time and it
wasn't until Costa had taken a troop and

801
00:52:54,431 --> 00:52:57,220
scouting out a good road that
the heavy wagons could make it.

802
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,620
Custer was mighty good
at this kind of work.

803
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,380
He had a nose for scouting
and finding the best trails.

804
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,690
It was June.
It was.

805
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:14,700
It was noon on June 22nd when we
broke camp and started our march up.

806
00:53:14,701 --> 00:53:15,534
The Rosebud.

807
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:16,910
Yeah.

808
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,340
This just before we packed our mules,

809
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,850
Benton ordered us to take
an extra supply of salt.

810
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,630
That meant we might be living on mule
or a horse meat before we got back.

811
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,340
I suppose we all knew by this time
that we'd be hitting it into dangerous

812
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:35,880
country,
but as I look back,

813
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,880
I don't believe many
troopers were very worried.

814
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:40,950
We knew there'd be some hard fighting,

815
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,400
but a soldier always feels that it's
the other fellow who's going to get it.

816
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:50,030
Never himself that morning word spread
about the camp that mail was going to be

817
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:55,110
sent back home and that this would likely
be the last chance to get off letters.

818
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,840
Of course,
I didn't have anybody to write too,

819
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,740
but the officers in many of the men
hurriedly scribbled letters to their dear

820
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:06,270
ones
and as I go to mail off these letters,

821
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,130
they are on a boat.

822
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:13,190
The troops are on a boat and they barely
gone 50 feet with these letters to get

823
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:14,684
a mailed off.

824
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:20,060
When the boat was overturned and all
three men disappeared along with the mail

825
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:20,964
sack.

826
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,010
Now here's the orders that they'd
go get as they're going up.

827
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,020
These are actually the
orders to Custer and again,

828
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:31,320
what's awesome is these are documented.
This isn't the hearsay.

829
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:35,040
These are documented orders.
Colonel,

830
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,630
the brigadier general commanding directs
that as soon as your regiment can be

831
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:40,980
made ready for the march,

832
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:45,120
you proceed up the Rosebud in pursuit
of the Indians who's trailed was

833
00:54:45,121 --> 00:54:50,121
discovered by major reno a few days since
it is of course impossible to give you

834
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:54,900
any definite instructions
in regard to this movement.

835
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,290
And we're not impossible to do.
So.

836
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:03,210
The department commander places too
much confidence in your zeal energy and

837
00:55:03,211 --> 00:55:07,710
ability to wish to impose on
you precise orders pretty.

838
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,210
So he's giving them,
hey look,

839
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,820
here's my general idea is give
them some commanders in tent,

840
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,560
but he doesn't want to give them
anything too specific because he knows he

841
00:55:16,561 --> 00:55:16,920
can't.

842
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,590
He hasn't always going to be in two days
what's going to be happening up there.

843
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,750
He will,
however,

844
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:26,751
indicate to you his own views of what
action should be and desires that you

845
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:31,710
should conform to them unless you should
see sufficient reason for departing

846
00:55:31,711 --> 00:55:33,690
from them.
So he gives him his orders,

847
00:55:33,691 --> 00:55:36,780
but he gives them some pretty
good leeway to work through.

848
00:55:36,781 --> 00:55:37,614
And that's why there's some,

849
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:41,850
there's some discussion on
whether or not custard disobeyed

850
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,870
and there's a,
it's a,

851
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,450
it's a long discussion probably with
no one could ever come with a solid

852
00:55:48,451 --> 00:55:53,070
conclusion on because there was some,
there was definitely some,

853
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,480
some leeway in the orders and those
that was the leeway that I just read.

854
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,700
Then the orders continue to go on,

855
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,210
but I'm not going to go into
those minor details of them.

856
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,820
Back to the book. We hit the trail at
five o'clock sharp that second morning.

857
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:12,960
These guys are up pretty early.
Probably had to get up like,

858
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:14,730
I dunno,

859
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:19,730
four 30 to get before the to get to get
on the road before five o'clock around

860
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:23,250
noon we began past signs of big Indian.

861
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,000
As I remember we made
around 33 miles that day.

862
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:28,880
Okay.

863
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,940
The next day we rode hard to,
there was no foolishness.

864
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:37,420
Custer had a bunch of re and crow
scout's ahead with him and he kept them

865
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,690
covering the ground far off
both flanks of the column.

866
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,360
We were in Indian country now. Right
enough. So that's, that's very common.

867
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,650
We'd still do that today.

868
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,800
You have a main element moving in a in
a formation and out on the flanks or

869
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:54,770
maybe some high ground.

870
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:59,990
You have other smaller elements that can
protect your flanks and see if there's

871
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:03,470
any problems up ahead.
In one place, we halted,

872
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:05,270
there had been a sun dance lodge.

873
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,140
Okay.

874
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,230
The scalp of a white man was
still hanging from the ridge pole

875
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:12,860
getting into Indian country.

876
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,150
It was around eight o'clock
when we got orders to saddle up,

877
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:21,440
we marched about 10 miles when we
were halted in a sort of ravine.

878
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:25,250
We've been told to make as little
noise as possible in light. No fires.

879
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:29,900
There'd been no bugle calls for a
day or two. The Sun was at our back,

880
00:57:29,901 --> 00:57:33,830
so apparently we were headed straight
west. Now toward the little big horn,

881
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:39,470
I later learned that the Indians called
it greasy grass. I never did know why.

882
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,283
Yeah.

883
00:57:41,510 --> 00:57:42,261
About the time.

884
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:46,250
General Custer came back from his scout
word run around that the Indians had

885
00:57:46,251 --> 00:57:51,020
found a box of hardtack that had dropped
from one of Captain Yates is mules,

886
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,500
two or three troopers who had
been sent back to pick up the box,

887
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:59,150
had reported seeing two hostels trying
to open it with their Tomahawks.

888
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,830
This meant that the Indians held us,
had us under observation.

889
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:04,950
Okay.

890
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,910
Apparently custard figured on hiding
the command in the ravine during the day

891
00:58:08,911 --> 00:58:12,990
and then attacking the big Indian village
on the little big horn at daybreak the

892
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:13,823
next morning.

893
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,210
So there, there, there,

894
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:20,730
yeah.

895
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:24,540
They know that the Indians
know that they're there.
This is why I included that.

896
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,050
Then you're going to hear that
kind of over and over again.

897
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,290
Custer's thinking they're
going to surprise him and
everyone's telling him we're

898
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:35,460
not going to surprise them. They know
we're here. It was Sunday morning,

899
00:58:35,461 --> 00:58:40,020
June 25th we were still more than 12
miles from the little horn and the Indian

900
00:58:40,021 --> 00:58:44,370
village, but the Indians knew
where we were and all about us.

901
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,313
Okay.

902
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:53,170
I approached,
I approached as near that now.

903
00:58:53,171 --> 00:58:53,601
So there he,

904
00:58:53,601 --> 00:58:57,580
he's a conversation going on and it's
actually coster and Ben teen and they're

905
00:58:57,581 --> 00:59:00,820
having a conversation with a couple of
people including some of the scouts and

906
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:03,760
he kind of goes over and does a
little ease dropping as I approached,

907
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:05,620
as near as seemed respectful.

908
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,840
And while I was waiting to
catch Ben Teens attention,

909
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:11,740
I couldn't help but overhear part of
the conversation. Charlie Reynolds,

910
00:59:11,741 --> 00:59:16,741
the famous white scout who is never to
see the sunset that day was talking.

911
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:21,350
And I heard him say that there was the
biggest bunch of Indians he'd ever seen

912
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,520
over there. Finally I heard.
But venting state Acosta hadn't.

913
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:30,340
We better keep the regiment together
general if this is a big camp,

914
00:59:30,341 --> 00:59:33,020
as they say,
we'll need every man we have.

915
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,460
Custer's only answer was
you have your orders.

916
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:47,320
So you can see again, [inaudible]
ease, not listening to people,

917
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:48,663
Scouts,

918
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,710
reconnaissance units and his
other officers that are with him.

919
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:58,810
And this is sort of the classic,
you know, Hey, I've got a,

920
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:01,840
I've got an I disagree with your plan.
Shut up and do it anyways.

921
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,210
You have your orders.
That's a classic example of that.

922
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:07,743
Okay.

923
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:12,890
We were tired and dirty and hungry or
horses hadn't had a good drink of water

924
01:00:13,051 --> 01:00:15,840
since the day before and
we weren't much better off.

925
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:21,730
We knew right enough that
this was the day, this was it.

926
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,120
This was what we'd been training
and working for all these years.

927
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,740
Captain Benton used to say,

928
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:30,640
the government pays you to get
shot at and I suppose the dumbest,

929
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:34,990
greenest trooper and the regimen figured
that this day he'd get shot at plenty.

930
01:00:43,910 --> 01:00:48,910
Here was the seventh cavalry with a
total of some 600 men split up into four

931
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:53,600
outfits.
Apparently the Indian scouts

932
01:00:55,770 --> 01:01:00,770
and experienced old guys guides knew
that there were several thousand of the

933
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:03,150
hostels,
but it was,

934
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:07,170
it is my belief that cost her and most
of our officers thought they'd have to

935
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:12,090
whip somewhere between 1,015 hundred
and they expected most of these to be

936
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:16,260
poorly armed and poorly
led from experience.

937
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:20,790
They figured the Indians would fight
only a rear guard action while the women,

938
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:23,580
children,
old men and pony herds got away.

939
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:29,130
But in place of a maximum of 1500
Indian warriors, it developed it.

940
01:01:29,131 --> 01:01:33,300
There were possibly twice that number
about to face costers total of 600

941
01:01:36,310 --> 01:01:39,880
so that's the report that they're getting.
And

942
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:47,930
there's a little bit of
controversy about what,

943
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:52,910
how many Indians were there, but it
was a lot. And here, here we go. This,

944
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:57,560
I'm going to jump forward to another
section and talking about Custer and did

945
01:01:57,561 --> 01:02:01,790
cost her. The name of the chapter is
did Koster and it's sort of a appendix,

946
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:05,210
so it's not part of the story, it's
after the story, but it talks about,

947
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,970
did Costa refuse advice from his scouts?

948
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:12,030
How many Indian warriors were camped
on the West Bank of the little big horn

949
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:15,800
that Sunday morning of June
25th against the real figure,

950
01:02:15,801 --> 01:02:18,020
how many customers think
he would have to fight?

951
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:21,510
Did customer refuse to believe
the estimated number of warriors?

952
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:23,310
Has Scouts told him he
would have to fight?

953
01:02:23,550 --> 01:02:27,600
Did he fail to follow the advice of his
experienced guides? And interpreters.

954
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,920
One of the best accounts of what the
guides thought about the number of Indians

955
01:02:31,921 --> 01:02:36,600
and the chances of Custer closing with
them is contained in the excellent book.

956
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:41,340
William Jackson Indian scout
by James William Schulz,

957
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,780
Willard shots.

958
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:47,250
It is worth careful reading and
here's a couple of excerpts from that.

959
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,140
On the third day we struck
the trail of the hostels,

960
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:57,210
the one that Reno had found several
days before said bloody knife.

961
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,830
Now remember bloody knife is is customers,

962
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:06,180
you know main scout there,
they're tight said bloody knife.

963
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,170
My friends,

964
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,970
the big this big tree
trail proves what we heard.

965
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:13,430
Okay,

966
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,610
that the Ogallala,
the Miniconjou,

967
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,480
the sand Sark and the Teton sue have
left their agencies to join sitting bull

968
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,250
and crazy horse horse.

969
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,840
I'm sure that even this trail does not
account for all that have left their

970
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:30,680
agencies.

971
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,920
There surely are other trails and trails
to of the Cheyennes and the Arapahos

972
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:41,510
bloody knife continued.

973
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:45,110
It is as I have told long hair,

974
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:49,130
this gathering of enemy
tribes is too many for us,

975
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,990
but he will not believe me.

976
01:03:52,190 --> 01:03:54,200
He is bound to lead us against them.

977
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:58,040
They are not far away
just over this ridge.

978
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:02,780
They are all in Campton waiting for us
crazy horse and sitting bull are not men

979
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:03,171
without,

980
01:04:03,171 --> 01:04:08,030
since they have their scouts too and some
of them surely have their eyes upon us.

981
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,420
Well tomorrow we are
going to have a big fight,

982
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:16,340
a losing fight myself.
I know what is to happen to me.

983
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:21,310
My sacred helper has given me warning
that I am not to see the set of tomorrow's

984
01:04:21,311 --> 01:04:22,144
son.

985
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,563
Okay.

986
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:27,230
Sad words.
Those they chilled us.

987
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:32,180
I saw Charlie Reynolds nod in agreement
to them and was chilled again when he

988
01:04:32,181 --> 01:04:33,380
said in a low voice.

989
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:37,370
I feel as he does tomorrow
will be the end for me too.

990
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:38,610
Okay.

991
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:43,610
Anyone who wants my little outfit of
stuff pointing to his war pack can have it

992
01:04:43,681 --> 01:04:44,514
now.

993
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,240
Lieutenant Varnum who is in charge of
the scouts came over and said that it was

994
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:54,350
general Koster's plan to attempt a
surprise attack on the camp of the enemy.

995
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:55,480
Okay.

996
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,040
Said bloody knife. We cannot surprise
the enemy. They are not crazy.

997
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:01,170
Yeah.

998
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:02,970
Without DME,
without doubt,

999
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,360
their scouts have watched
every move we have made.

1000
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:12,773
Okay.

1001
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:15,920
Convinced at last that we could
not possibly surprise the enemy.

1002
01:05:15,921 --> 01:05:20,921
General Custer ordered a quick advance
with the scouts and himself in the lead.

1003
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,210
Okay.

1004
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:26,960
We had not gone far when bloody knife
and his to RISD joined us and reported

1005
01:05:26,961 --> 01:05:30,620
that on the other side of the ridge
they had found the day old trail of many

1006
01:05:30,621 --> 01:05:33,350
more enemy going toward the
valley of little big horn.

1007
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:38,150
They were excited and
said to cost or general.

1008
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,330
We have discovered the camp down
there on the little big horn.

1009
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,270
It is a big one too big for you to tackle.
Why?

1010
01:05:44,271 --> 01:05:48,410
There are thousands and thousands of
Sioux and Cheyenne is down there for a

1011
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:48,771
moment.

1012
01:05:48,771 --> 01:05:53,771
That general stared at him angrily I
thought and then said sternly I shall

1013
01:05:54,591 --> 01:05:55,430
attack them.

1014
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:02,000
Classic Ego Maniac right here.
Sorry, but that's what this is.

1015
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:03,543
Yeah.

1016
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:11,750
Coster gave orders for attack upon the
camp. None of the scouts had been foreign.

1017
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:16,010
The lead and they all came in.
Reason Crows and whites and Robert and I,

1018
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,160
we were a gathering of solemn faces
speaking in English and the sign language

1019
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,970
too so that all would understand.
Brewer described them, the enemy camp,

1020
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:27,050
it was,

1021
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:31,790
he said all of three miles long
and made up of hundreds of lodges,

1022
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:35,570
hundreds and hundreds of lodges
above it and below it and west of it.

1023
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:39,140
There were thousands and thousands
of horses that were being close,

1024
01:06:39,141 --> 01:06:41,480
hurted with his few riders.

1025
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:46,430
Long hair decided to attack the camp and
we were going to have a terrible fight.

1026
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:51,800
We should all take courage, fight
hard, make our every shot a killer.

1027
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:56,480
He finished and none spoke.
But after a minute or two,

1028
01:06:56,660 --> 01:06:59,660
bloody knife looked up
and signed to the sun.

1029
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:03,110
I shall not see you go down
behind the mountains tonight.

1030
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,360
And at that I almost choked.

1031
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:10,190
I felt he knew his end was near
and there was no escaping it.

1032
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,720
I turned and looked the other way.
I thought that my own end was near.

1033
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:20,480
I felt very sad.
So there's the full account of these.

1034
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:26,600
All the scouts, some are, you know,
some are white, some are Indian,

1035
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:31,070
native Americans, different tribes, and
they're all telling them the same thing.

1036
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,200
This is not a good plan.

1037
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,143
Yeah.

1038
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:37,750
So back to the book,

1039
01:07:37,751 --> 01:07:41,530
apparently cost her head planned
to stay in hiding in the ravine.

1040
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:45,490
We had reached a little after 10 o'clock
that Sunday and then attack the village

1041
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:50,050
at daybreak the next morning of the 26
that would more or less of dovetailed

1042
01:07:50,051 --> 01:07:52,630
into Terry's idea of boxing the Indians.

1043
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,900
But when he found the hostile
scouts had discovered his column,

1044
01:07:56,050 --> 01:07:59,050
he figured there was nothing
to do but attack at once.

1045
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,810
Now we get a little,
um,

1046
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:16,130
a little report here from a guy named
Sergeant Daniel [inaudible] who had barely

1047
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:24,830
turned 23 at the time of the battle
in canapes own account of the fight

1048
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:28,250
published in the magazine of the
Historical Society of Montana.

1049
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,800
He said, when we got to the top of the
bluffs, the Indians had disappeared,

1050
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,590
but we were in plain
view of the Indian camps,

1051
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:41,090
which appeared to cover a space of about
two miles wide and four miles long on

1052
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:45,050
the west side of the river.
We were then charging it full speed.

1053
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:51,980
This camp is two miles wide. That's
a mat. Two miles, two by four,

1054
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:55,760
two by four miles,
and you've got 600 guys.

1055
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:58,460
I actually didn't even cost it
doesn't have 600 guys to get 200 guys.

1056
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:01,543
Yeah.

1057
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:05,760
Reno and his troops were again seen to
our left moving at full speed down the

1058
01:09:05,761 --> 01:09:07,800
valley at the site of the Indian camps.

1059
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:12,801
The boys of our five troops
began to cheer overconfidence.

1060
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:13,740
Hmm.

1061
01:09:13,740 --> 01:09:17,010
Some of the horses became so excited
that the writers were unable to hold them

1062
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:17,670
in ranks.

1063
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:22,230
And the last word I heard general Custer
say we're hold your horses in boys.

1064
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,760
There are plenty of them down
there for all of us. Again,

1065
01:09:26,761 --> 01:09:30,780
now we have total overconfidence in the
situation. We think we're going to win.

1066
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:35,010
This is going to be fun. Oh,
there's two by four mile big camp.

1067
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:37,500
No big deal.
I got 500 guys with me.

1068
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,650
So this is where the force is split up
and Costa goes off to attack any good.

1069
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:48,180
It seems like he goes about a mile
away, mile and a half away. And again,

1070
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:50,850
I'm going to make the same statement that
I said when I talked about the battle

1071
01:09:50,851 --> 01:09:53,640
with w w when we did
the wooden leg podcast.

1072
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:58,020
I'm not trying to re historically
reconstruct a battle right now.

1073
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,490
There's plenty of books that do that,

1074
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:05,030
so I'm just kind of assembling the
broad design of what's happening.

1075
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:07,933
Yeah.

1076
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:12,540
So now the forest is split up a reno
and venting or kind of have troops and

1077
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,120
holding, but they're starting to get
in a little firefight themselves.

1078
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:20,180
We saw a second figure in uniform
riding towards us. He was Trump,

1079
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:24,510
a tier Martini of my company who had
been assigned that morning as a special

1080
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:26,970
orderly Trump a to general Custer.

1081
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,920
I learned afterwards that he had a
message from or to Ben teen that had been

1082
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:36,150
scribbled out on a field order
pad and signed by Lieutenant Cook,

1083
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:40,680
the adjutant it read Ben Teen.
Come on,

1084
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:44,160
big village, be quick. Bring packs.

1085
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,830
Ps bring pack.

1086
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:48,670
Okay.

1087
01:10:48,670 --> 01:10:52,960
That's the note that they get from Custer.
Sounds like customer might might've.

1088
01:10:52,961 --> 01:10:57,910
Uh, once he split off, things
started going sideways real quick.

1089
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:01,933
They

1090
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:06,580
again, Ben Teen and and Reno have their
troops start now getting engaged in a

1091
01:11:06,581 --> 01:11:10,360
firefight. Back to the book we
could hear heavy firing now.

1092
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:15,030
Before long we passed several cro or
re scouts driving a few heads of Indian

1093
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:18,720
ponies and they shouted soldiers and
pointed toward the bluffs that were rising

1094
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:19,590
towards the north.

1095
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:23,310
We knew that we were close to the valley
of little big horn and that somewhere

1096
01:11:23,311 --> 01:11:25,650
in this neighborhood there
was hard fighting going on.

1097
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:29,970
Benton ordered us to draw pistols and
we charged up the bluffs that a gallop

1098
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:32,460
expecting at any moment
to run into hostels.

1099
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:36,660
When we reached the brow of
the first set of rolling hills,

1100
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:40,710
the river valley suddenly
opened up below us to our left.

1101
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:45,950
It was a sight to strike terror in the
hearts of the bravest men down there in

1102
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:46,501
the valley,

1103
01:11:46,501 --> 01:11:51,501
maybe 150 feet or more below us and
somewhere around a half a mile away there

1104
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:56,640
were figure scalloping on horseback and
much shooting farther down the river.

1105
01:11:56,641 --> 01:12:01,050
There were great masses of mounted men.
We suspicioned we're Indians.

1106
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:04,440
We were going at it at
a fast clip ourselves,

1107
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:09,620
and we had no more than caught the
swift glimpse of this tragic battlefield

1108
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:10,590
below.

1109
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:14,910
When we saw mounted and
dismounted soldiers on a
knoll of a hill onto the north

1110
01:12:14,911 --> 01:12:17,310
ward,
we swiftly road towards them.

1111
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:22,620
So these guys are seeing this
massive battle take place.

1112
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:24,060
They're kind of on the high ground.

1113
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,920
He talks about here what kind of weapon
tree the the Indians had for my part.

1114
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,800
I believe that fully half of the
warriors carried only bows and arrows and

1115
01:12:38,801 --> 01:12:42,910
lances and that possibly half of the
remainder carried odds and end of old

1116
01:12:42,911 --> 01:12:46,690
muzzle loaders and single shot
rifles of various vintages.

1117
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:51,670
Probably not more than 25 or 30% of the
warriors carried modern repeating rifles.

1118
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:54,400
That sounds pretty close
to what would leg said.

1119
01:12:54,490 --> 01:12:57,250
They said they mostly had bows and
arrows. Nate, some guys had rifles,

1120
01:12:57,430 --> 01:13:02,430
but it was mostly bows and arrows and
one other port Indian boys from 14 years

1121
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:05,830
old up accompanied the
warriors and took part,

1122
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:09,550
especially in the later stages of the
fighting the soldiers. Incidentally,

1123
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:14,551
we're armed with single shot 45 70 caliber
Springfield carbines and accurate and

1124
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:19,360
deadly wrapping up to 600 yards,
but when fired rapidly,

1125
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:23,590
the breach became foul and the
greasy cartridges often jammed.

1126
01:13:23,591 --> 01:13:25,630
It could not be removed by the extractor.

1127
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:29,950
This meant that the empty shell had to
be forced out by the blade of a hunting

1128
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:30,784
knife.

1129
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:35,200
This very fact was responsible for the
death of many a trooper this hot Sunday

1130
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:38,860
and may actually have been the
indirect cause of the great disaster

1131
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,520
weapons, getting dirty
weapons, getting hot and dirty,

1132
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:44,660
got to take care of your weapon.

1133
01:13:44,661 --> 01:13:47,570
It sounds like this was a beyond them
just taking care of their weapon. Right.

1134
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,420
Sounds like it was a design issue as well.
Yeah.

1135
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:57,490
Renew had crossed the river and had his
troops in line of columns of four with

1136
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:01,760
the Indian,
with the Indian scouts on his left.

1137
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:06,530
Soon Indian horsemen were seen writing
madly to and fro in the valley and

1138
01:14:06,531 --> 01:14:11,531
shortly the southern end of the
Indian camps came into Reno.

1139
01:14:12,101 --> 01:14:16,060
Now had his three troops and scouts
thrown out in a skirmish line covering

1140
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:18,340
possibly the full width
of the narrow valley.

1141
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,050
So there they see the enemy. Now they
get online. That's a very common thing.

1142
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:27,130
If you can picture this, you've got your
guys in a column. How many, if we are,

1143
01:14:27,131 --> 01:14:31,780
if you're in a column of
three, three columns and you
see the enemy ahead of you,

1144
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,580
how many people do think can shoot the
three, the three, the three in the front.

1145
01:14:36,581 --> 01:14:37,750
So that's why you keep hearing this,

1146
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:42,010
this idea of a skirmish line and it's
the same tactic that we use now. Oh,

1147
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:44,290
we got enemy in front of us.
Cool. We're going to get online.

1148
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,030
They call it a skirmish line here. We
would call it a get online. Like they'll,

1149
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:53,010
they're spread out red on one. Yup. So
now they get, they got 50 guys cold.

1150
01:14:53,011 --> 01:14:55,190
I have 50 guns online instead of three.
Yeah.

1151
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:01,600
Realizing that this charge toward the
Indian hordes would end in almost certain

1152
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:05,500
disaster. Reno now ordered his
troops to dismount and fight on foot.

1153
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,420
Even before this order came,

1154
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:12,421
scores of Indians had swung to the south
westward and pressed against the cro

1155
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:15,640
and re scouts.
These were forced to give way.

1156
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:19,540
Things were looking bad for Reno and he
ordered a skirmish lines to fall back to

1157
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:23,560
the edge of a heavy grove of cottonwoods
that followed a bend in the river and

1158
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,540
jutted out halfway across the valley,

1159
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:29,740
the horses were led into the woods while
a thin line of men held three sides of

1160
01:15:29,741 --> 01:15:30,574
the Grove,

1161
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,750
some 90 men were holding not
less than 250 yards of line,

1162
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,190
hundreds of mounted Indians.
We're now half circling the skirmish line,

1163
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:43,600
riding in close, firing from under their
ponies next and then galloping away.

1164
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:48,820
Reno's men were now either firing from
a prone position or using the bank of a

1165
01:15:48,821 --> 01:15:51,640
dry creek bed as a
barricade and rifle rest.

1166
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:57,200
So Reno's guys are now getting basically
surrounded in taking up this new

1167
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,370
position. Sergeant O'hara
of troop m had been killed.

1168
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:02,680
The first man on the skirmish line to die.

1169
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:07,090
Apparently Reno had a fairly defendable
position and some people think if he had

1170
01:16:07,091 --> 01:16:10,240
pulled in his lines and
consolidated his position,

1171
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:13,630
he might've held out here for
an indefinite length of time,

1172
01:16:13,870 --> 01:16:18,670
or at least as long as his ammunition
lasted. But the savage yells,

1173
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:19,810
the heavy firing,

1174
01:16:19,811 --> 01:16:24,811
the smoke and dust all and fear
all combined to fog his judgment.

1175
01:16:27,210 --> 01:16:31,470
Suddenly Custer's favorite scout bloody
knife was shot through the head and his

1176
01:16:31,471 --> 01:16:33,120
brain scattered all over Reno.

1177
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:39,610
Then the Scout Dorman fell and Charlie
Reynolds was shot through the head Reno

1178
01:16:39,830 --> 01:16:43,910
figuring that his only chance lay in
getting to high ground across the river,

1179
01:16:43,911 --> 01:16:48,860
shouted for his men to mount
up and company formation
to troop commanders heard

1180
01:16:48,861 --> 01:16:53,400
the order and amid the confusion and
excitement had their men mount up and line

1181
01:16:53,401 --> 01:16:54,860
and column of force.

1182
01:16:55,580 --> 01:17:00,440
The third troop g under lieutenant
Macintosh himself, part Indian,

1183
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,080
who had been adopted by General Mcintosh,

1184
01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:07,370
was in the woods and did not get the
order until the two other troops with Reno

1185
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:08,270
riding at their head.

1186
01:17:08,271 --> 01:17:11,480
We're racing upstream trying to
find a place to cross the river.

1187
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,020
All order and discipline were gone.

1188
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,750
So they're surrounded, things fall apart.
He's basically saying, we got to retreat,

1189
01:17:21,751 --> 01:17:22,770
we gotta get Outta here.

1190
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:26,580
And the assessment was that maybe
they were in a defendable position.

1191
01:17:26,581 --> 01:17:29,970
They could have held there, but who knows?
Who knows whether that's true or not.

1192
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:37,120
Nobody will ever know how any man
escaped alive from this mad retreat.

1193
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:42,590
All we are sure of is that the charging
troop broke through the cordon of

1194
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:47,120
mounted Indians and followed a
buffalo Prath to the river here.

1195
01:17:47,210 --> 01:17:51,560
They somehow manage to jump their
horses over a four or five foot bank,

1196
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:56,240
plunge across the stream and scramble
up a narrow trail to the steep hills,

1197
01:17:56,241 --> 01:17:57,074
to the east,

1198
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:02,150
hundreds of Indians fired indiscriminately
into the panic stricken soldiers.

1199
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,090
And the wonder is that
any trooper escaped,

1200
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:11,500
no motion picture could be as fantastic
as this wild milling of frightened men

1201
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,860
and horses.

1202
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:15,420
Okay.

1203
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:19,590
Again, just to remind you that this is
what's happening with Reno and his group.

1204
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:23,460
They don't know where Costa is
right now with his crew of 200 guys

1205
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:29,820
back to the book in all 26 troopers in
scouts and three officers were killed

1206
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:35,010
either in this ride through the Indian
gauntlet or back at the edge of the woods

1207
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:40,610
of the 19 men left behind 17 cross the
river and reached Reno Hill on foot

1208
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:43,320
within two hours.

1209
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:49,280
Lieutenant Wdo and private O'Neil
did not join us until 36 hours later.

1210
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,220
They came right through
where I was on guard.

1211
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:56,670
It was now somewhere around
three 30 in the afternoon.

1212
01:18:56,910 --> 01:19:01,620
Reno Shaken and unnerved had reached
the hilltop and hear his frightened

1213
01:19:01,621 --> 01:19:03,360
troopers.
We're joining him.

1214
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:07,080
He was whipped and
completely disorganized.

1215
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:15,500
This is a rally point and if you have a
predesignated rally point and you say,

1216
01:19:17,011 --> 01:19:20,790
hey guys, look, you see this big hill
over here. If everything goes to hell,

1217
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,170
can we get all jumbled up?
Go to that point.

1218
01:19:25,770 --> 01:19:28,890
It doesn't sound like he
actually pre-brief that
cause that would have been a,

1219
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,540
you could've just said, hey,
back to the rally point.

1220
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:34,710
You could have given a very clear order
if you're trying to not really know

1221
01:19:34,711 --> 01:19:37,770
where you're going and you're saying
retreat while you don't do it in a very

1222
01:19:37,771 --> 01:19:40,950
organized fashion.
So preplan some contingencies.

1223
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:42,043
Hmm.

1224
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:49,830
Now they get in this position and Reno,

1225
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:54,690
like I said, is in rough shape. Back
to the book. Cool, capable Ben teen,

1226
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:59,840
more or less assumed command major Rooney
Reno had just come through a terrible

1227
01:19:59,881 --> 01:20:04,530
experience and at the moment was glad
to have Ben teen, his junior takeover,

1228
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:06,150
quickly venting,

1229
01:20:06,151 --> 01:20:09,990
dismounted his own three troops and
ordered us to form a skirmish line.

1230
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,900
Reno's men had expended
most of their ammunition.

1231
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:17,250
So we were told to divide ours with them.
We had Ben Teens,

1232
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:19,140
hundred and 20 men intact,

1233
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:24,420
and there were around 60 men who'd
been fighting in the valley with Reno.

1234
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:28,740
And even before we got the kinks out of
our legs from our long horse hours in

1235
01:20:28,741 --> 01:20:32,280
the saddle, we were asking
each other, where's Custer,

1236
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,360
what had become of Custer
and his five troops?

1237
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:43,130
Apparently Custer was now much farther
on to the north ward and in this moment

1238
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:46,440
was hotly engaged,
but no one was certain.

1239
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:50,430
All we knew was that he had disappeared
with almost half the regiment.

1240
01:20:52,110 --> 01:20:55,890
We could hear the sound of distant firing
echoing through the hills and valleys

1241
01:20:55,891 --> 01:20:58,770
from that direction.
Customer must be down there.

1242
01:21:01,410 --> 01:21:06,270
So this is happening there in the skirmish
position and they're starting to try

1243
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:10,350
and get reorganized back to the book.

1244
01:21:10,351 --> 01:21:12,690
The wounded men who could
mount were put on horses,

1245
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,130
but the others were carried in blankets
by details of six troopers on foot.

1246
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:21,030
It takes a lot of people to carry it down,
man down man.

1247
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,130
It takes a lot of people to carry it down,
man,

1248
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,780
and in this case it takes six
people to carry one down. Man.

1249
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:32,280
Nowadays we weigh a lot more.
We got, we got all of our guns,

1250
01:21:32,281 --> 01:21:37,140
we got body armor. It's hard.
Guys are heavy. Pretty soon

1251
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:42,480
it looked as if the Indian
masters were coming towards us.

1252
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:46,290
It didn't take long to realize
that this was true here.

1253
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:51,000
We were stretched out all over hell's
half Acre a troop. On this hill mob,

1254
01:21:51,001 --> 01:21:54,470
another in this little valley
and a third and over there,

1255
01:21:54,471 --> 01:21:59,471
a third troop behind at a slow walk came
packed trains the wounded men and the

1256
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:05,391
rear guard reno inventing both sense
danger and order to withdrawal.

1257
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:11,030
The advanced troops were dismounting
and fought as skirmishers in the center.

1258
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:13,980
In a slight depression,

1259
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:18,981
the horses and mules were staked and
an inadequate little field hospital was

1260
01:22:20,641 --> 01:22:21,420
established,

1261
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:25,800
but it was impossible to shield the men
and stock from the Indians firing from a

1262
01:22:25,801 --> 01:22:30,330
hilltop off to the east. Indians got
some high ground on him. Can't stop them.

1263
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:33,960
What do you do? They got to high
ground you. You can't hide animal.

1264
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:36,600
After animals killed and the men were hit,

1265
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:39,150
it was tough not to be able
to do something about it.

1266
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:45,710
We'd hardly got settled on
our own skirmish line with
age men posted at 20 foot

1267
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,700
intervals when the Indians and all but
completely surrounded us and the fighting

1268
01:22:50,701 --> 01:22:55,350
begin in earnest.
There was no full fledged charge,

1269
01:22:55,351 --> 01:22:58,230
but little groups of Indians would
creep up as close as they could get.

1270
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:01,680
And for behind bushes or
little nose open fire,

1271
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,100
they'd practiced all kinds of
cute tricks to draw our fire.

1272
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,950
Maybe a naked redskin would suddenly
jumped to his feet and while you drew a

1273
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:11,080
bead on him,
he'd throw himself to the ground.

1274
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:14,243
Okay?

1275
01:23:14,610 --> 01:23:18,930
They're under this attack for
a pretty good amount of time.

1276
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:24,560
And then finally the sun went down
that night like a ball of fire.

1277
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:29,670
Pretty soon the quick Montana twilight
settled down on us and then came the

1278
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,590
chill of the high plains.

1279
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:36,750
There was no moon and no one ever
welcome darkness more than we did.

1280
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,680
We felt terribly alone on
that dangerous hilltop.

1281
01:23:40,681 --> 01:23:44,700
We were million miles from nowhere
and death was all around us.

1282
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,340
Okay?

1283
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,130
All through that Short Black Knight,

1284
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:52,880
the orgy went on down
below in the river valley.

1285
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,130
It struck fear in our hearts,

1286
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:59,780
just as the mystery of
Custer's disappearance made
our blood run cold each time

1287
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:03,230
we tried to solve it, where was
coster? What had happened to him?

1288
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:05,743
Okay,

1289
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:09,400
so down there, up there, they're
hiding. It's dark, they're scared,

1290
01:24:09,401 --> 01:24:14,401
they got wounded in all they hear down
in the valley as the Indians going crazy.

1291
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:18,820
The rhythm of the Tom Tom's the wild
victory dance. They can hear all this.

1292
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,153
Okay,

1293
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:25,590
back to the book. They're talking about
cost or they could not all be killed,

1294
01:24:25,650 --> 01:24:29,100
not Lucky Koster and those five
gallon troops who rolled with him,

1295
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:34,800
why did he abandoned us? And those three
bloody hours before dark said, save us.

1296
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:38,850
We had no less than a dozen men killed
and three times that number of wounded.

1297
01:24:39,930 --> 01:24:40,410
Okay.

1298
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:41,400
He's actually saying,
man,

1299
01:24:41,401 --> 01:24:45,630
where was Custer here we were getting
crushed on the battlefield and cook cost

1300
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,700
or is not there to support
us. Where do you go? Hmm.

1301
01:24:51,330 --> 01:24:56,330
Now during the night at reigns a little
bit and finally the sun starts to come

1302
01:24:57,361 --> 01:25:00,690
up and just as the sun starts to come up,

1303
01:25:00,691 --> 01:25:02,610
it starts getting light back to the book.

1304
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:05,070
Joan said something about
taking off his overcoat.

1305
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:08,580
He started to roll on his side so he
could get his arms and shoulders out

1306
01:25:08,581 --> 01:25:13,410
without exploding, exposing himself
to fire. Suddenly I heard him cry out.

1307
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:18,750
He'd been shot straight through the heart,
minute or two later,

1308
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:22,560
another bullet from the hilltop,
torn to the Hickory,

1309
01:25:22,561 --> 01:25:25,590
but have my rifle
splitting it squarely into,

1310
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:30,330
I was plenty mad because my army carbing
wouldn't let me return the compliment,

1311
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,170
so he just got shot.
The rifle stock actually happened.

1312
01:25:34,171 --> 01:25:39,120
One of my guys and in Ramadi,
one of my guys got is his rifle stock,

1313
01:25:39,121 --> 01:25:42,090
got blown up by an RPG.
I seem come,

1314
01:25:42,091 --> 01:25:44,790
fallen out of a sniper
position and he's got his arm.

1315
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:47,340
His weapon is in two pieces.

1316
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,150
I'm thinking how lucky to be alive.
Yeah.

1317
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:00,440
Along about this time are 30 or 40
wounded men began crying out for water.

1318
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:04,400
H troop held the hill on the south west.

1319
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,580
There was a draw that ran down the
west side of the hill to the river.

1320
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:11,990
It was a rough and exposed and it looked
like a dead cinch that anyone who tried

1321
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:14,450
to work his way down that drug,
the river would be killed.

1322
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,720
Indians concealed in the
bushes across the river.

1323
01:26:17,810 --> 01:26:21,920
We're firing up at us and they had every
foot of this draw and river riverbank

1324
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:22,783
covered.

1325
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,150
Okay.

1326
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:28,680
But we had to do something for those men
who were up wounded, crying for water.

1327
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,680
Finally bent [inaudible]
called for volunteers.

1328
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:32,980
Okay.

1329
01:26:32,980 --> 01:26:35,920
I think there were 17 of us all
together who stepped forward.

1330
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,760
He detailed four of us from h who were
extra good marksmen to take up an exposed

1331
01:26:42,101 --> 01:26:44,470
position on the brow of
the hill facing the river.

1332
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:48,700
We were to stand up and not only
draw the fire of the Indians below,

1333
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:52,000
but we were to pump as much lead as we
could into the bushes where the Indians

1334
01:26:52,001 --> 01:26:55,280
were hiding while the water
party hurry down to the draw,

1335
01:26:55,281 --> 01:26:59,620
got their buckets and pots and canteens
filled and then made their way back.

1336
01:27:00,720 --> 01:27:01,190
Yeah,

1337
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:02,630
so we got a little
covering move happening.

1338
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:07,280
Obviously it just happened that the four
of us who were posted on the hill where

1339
01:27:07,281 --> 01:27:11,300
all German boys, Geiger
Mechling void, and myself,

1340
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:13,130
none of us for war wounded,

1341
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:16,730
although we stood exposed on that
Ridge for more than 20 minutes and they

1342
01:27:16,731 --> 01:27:20,360
through plenty of lead at us.
Several of the water party, however,

1343
01:27:20,361 --> 01:27:21,380
were badly wounded.

1344
01:27:21,620 --> 01:27:25,340
Although we kept the steady fire into
the bushes where the Indians were hiding,

1345
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,490
each of us was given a
congressional medal of honor.

1346
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,053
Okay?

1347
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:33,900
You don't think about that.
You don't think about it. You,

1348
01:27:33,901 --> 01:27:36,480
you actually going to need water.
You run out of water,

1349
01:27:36,481 --> 01:27:37,960
you're going to get guys
dehydrated and a die.

1350
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:39,810
So now you're gonna risk
people's lives to go get water.

1351
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,490
Ben Teen had been walking up and down
the line urging men to hold fast,

1352
01:27:47,491 --> 01:27:51,720
not to waste their firing, to keep
cool. I remember saying to him, colonel,

1353
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:55,260
you better get down sir. You'll
get killed. Don't worry about me.

1354
01:27:55,261 --> 01:27:57,390
He answered grimly I'm all right.

1355
01:27:58,020 --> 01:28:02,490
He sure lived a charmed life that day,
but things look bad.

1356
01:28:02,670 --> 01:28:06,690
And finally Benton hurried to the north
side of the lines and asked Major Reno

1357
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:07,860
for reinforcements.

1358
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:11,340
He made it clear that the Indians were
about to charge his line and then if they

1359
01:28:11,341 --> 01:28:14,730
were able to sweep over it,
the whole outfit would be destroyed.

1360
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:18,240
Reno told him to take as much
of an troupe as he could gather.

1361
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:22,920
Those men certainly look good to us.
Soon after they came up,

1362
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:26,760
Captain Benton led the charge,
yelling and firing.

1363
01:28:26,940 --> 01:28:31,470
We went at the double quick
and the Indians broken ran
when we had cleaned them

1364
01:28:31,471 --> 01:28:35,580
out for a hundred yards ahead of us. We
hustled back to our holes. Once again,

1365
01:28:35,581 --> 01:28:40,440
we settled back to the business of
getting fired at with men hit at intervals

1366
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:44,610
with men hit at intervals and with the
poor horses and mules taking a terrible

1367
01:28:44,611 --> 01:28:47,640
beating in their hollow.
It must have been a long time.

1368
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:51,840
About long about this time that Ben
team called me to attention and made me

1369
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:52,674
sergeant.

1370
01:28:53,530 --> 01:28:53,800
Okay.

1371
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:57,550
We had one sergeant, two men killed,
and 12 wounded and age tree Palone.

1372
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,310
So once again,

1373
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,840
we see some and we also see
some focus of forces, right.

1374
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:06,960
We see some prioritize and execute,
hey, we're going to get overrun.

1375
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,820
There's our biggest problem right
now is we're going to get overrun.

1376
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:10,170
So you know what?
Hey,

1377
01:29:10,171 --> 01:29:13,350
major reno gave me a bunch of guys
and we're going to go do an aggressive

1378
01:29:13,351 --> 01:29:15,660
assault and take care of
this number one priority,

1379
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:18,810
so let's focus our forces on that.
Here we go, and that's what they did.

1380
01:29:19,470 --> 01:29:20,970
They got aggressive and got after it.

1381
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:23,540
Okay,

1382
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:24,141
back to the book,

1383
01:29:24,141 --> 01:29:27,770
the gunfire to almost ceased and some of
us left our trenches and student little

1384
01:29:27,771 --> 01:29:29,480
groups on the brow of the hill.

1385
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:34,550
Then something happened that I'll never
forget if I live to be a hundred the

1386
01:29:34,551 --> 01:29:38,330
heavy smoke seem to lift for a few
moments and they're in the valley below.

1387
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:42,620
We caught glimpses of the thousands of
Indians on foot and horseback with their

1388
01:29:42,621 --> 01:29:46,850
pony hoards with their pony herds,
dogs and pack animals,

1389
01:29:46,910 --> 01:29:50,990
and all the trappings of a gay
great camp solely moving southward.

1390
01:29:51,620 --> 01:29:53,780
It was like some biblical exodus.

1391
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:58,850
The Israelites moving into Egypt's
a mighty tribe on the march.

1392
01:29:59,540 --> 01:30:03,080
We thought at first that it must be some
trick that the Indians were only moving

1393
01:30:03,081 --> 01:30:06,830
their families from danger and that the
warriors would soon return and try to

1394
01:30:06,831 --> 01:30:09,080
overwhelm us patiently.

1395
01:30:09,081 --> 01:30:13,130
We weighed in in our little
trenches the long June afternoon,

1396
01:30:13,131 --> 01:30:15,080
dragged on the firing at all,

1397
01:30:15,081 --> 01:30:20,081
but ceased the smoke in the valley had
blown away and the last Indian had gone.

1398
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:27,060
Then Reno ordered the whole camp to
move as close to the river as possible.

1399
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,080
We would get as far as ways we could
from the terrible stench of death.

1400
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:35,910
There was plenty of water now for
the wounded and towards the evening.

1401
01:30:35,911 --> 01:30:39,600
The company cooks made us the
best meal they could. At least.

1402
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:44,601
We had hot coffee and plenty
of Bacon and so card attack.

1403
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:50,030
It was our first meal in 36 hours.
Then night came down.

1404
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:54,860
We were wary, but while those
on guard, we're awake and alert.

1405
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:58,520
The rest of the command slept,
but it was an uneasy sleep.

1406
01:30:58,790 --> 01:31:01,120
We still had heard no word from Costa.

1407
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:07,210
We began to suspicion that some terrible
fate might've ope overtaken him.

1408
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,820
What it was.
We could only guess.

1409
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:19,990
The Sun was well in the sky that next
morning of the 27th and we saw dust rising

1410
01:31:19,991 --> 01:31:21,730
slowly from the valley northward,

1411
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:26,330
so then they get approached
by a young officer.

1412
01:31:26,331 --> 01:31:27,980
They'd been out scouting
what was happening.

1413
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,440
A young officer flung
himself off his horse.

1414
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:36,030
He was Lieutenant Bradley Chief of Scouts.
Early this morning,

1415
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:37,710
scouting in the hills on the east side,

1416
01:31:37,711 --> 01:31:41,100
a little horn lieutenant Bradley had
come across a battlefield dotted with the

1417
01:31:41,101 --> 01:31:46,050
white bodies of dead men.
He had counted more than 190 dead.

1418
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:51,240
He was certain that Custer was among them.
Apparently no white man had escaped.

1419
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:52,770
One or two crow scouts.

1420
01:31:52,771 --> 01:31:57,771
Notably young curly had reported at the
steam or far west at the junction of

1421
01:31:58,291 --> 01:32:02,020
little big and big horn the day before.

1422
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,270
There had been no interpreter on hand,

1423
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:08,380
but curly had convinced the officer's
that all white soldiers who rode with

1424
01:32:08,381 --> 01:32:11,500
custard had been killed at dawn,

1425
01:32:11,501 --> 01:32:14,220
Lieutenant Bradley and
a few men and a few men.

1426
01:32:14,221 --> 01:32:18,730
It started out to search for the field
of tragedy. Curly was right. No soldier.

1427
01:32:18,731 --> 01:32:21,670
A white man had escaped a little later.

1428
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,880
The slight figure of bearded General
Terry with his staff and a small escort

1429
01:32:28,330 --> 01:32:33,010
arrived on the hill. There were tears
running down his cheeks when he spoke.

1430
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:38,020
I think most of us had tears in her eyes
to more than 200 of our comrades and

1431
01:32:38,021 --> 01:32:42,190
had met a violent death
and now naked on buried.

1432
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:46,510
We're lying in the hot Montana
Cen three miles northward.

1433
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:51,710
Okay,

1434
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:56,710
so they'd go out to recover the bodies
or bury the bodies there on patrol back

1435
01:32:59,291 --> 01:32:59,741
to the book.

1436
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:03,580
Suddenly we caught glimpses of white
objects lying along a ridge that led

1437
01:33:03,581 --> 01:33:06,280
northward.
We pulled up our horses.

1438
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,990
This was the battlefield here.

1439
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:12,540
Custer's La Loche had finally run out.

1440
01:33:13,700 --> 01:33:14,210
Okay.

1441
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,800
From the way the men lay,

1442
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:20,780
it was clear that the first one troop
had been ordered to dismount and fight as

1443
01:33:20,781 --> 01:33:21,620
a skirmish line.

1444
01:33:22,110 --> 01:33:26,150
Then a second troop had been posted
a little further on and to the east.

1445
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,700
Then a third troop and a fourth,

1446
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:34,130
and finally they're on the Knob of a
hill lace on 30 bodies in a small circle.

1447
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,930
We knew instinctively we
would find Custer. There.

1448
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,630
We wrote forward at a walk.

1449
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:44,510
Most of the troopers had been
stripped of clothing and scalped.

1450
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:48,560
Some of them had been horribly mutilated.
Custer was lying,

1451
01:33:48,561 --> 01:33:51,920
a trifle to the southeast
of the top of the knoll

1452
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,980
where the monument is today.

1453
01:33:55,910 --> 01:34:00,260
I stood six feet away holding captain
bent teens horse while he identified the

1454
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:03,200
general,
his body had not been touched,

1455
01:34:03,201 --> 01:34:08,201
say for a single bullet hole in the left
temple near the ear and a hole on his

1456
01:34:08,871 --> 01:34:13,100
left breast. He looked almost as if
it had been piece of we sleeping.

1457
01:34:13,820 --> 01:34:17,810
His brother Tom lay a few feet away.
He was terribly mutilated,

1458
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:22,700
scattered over the field where the
swollen bodies of the dead horses,

1459
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:24,290
but there were not many of them.

1460
01:34:24,710 --> 01:34:28,910
It seemed clear that the Indians sweeping
up from the draws and Cooley's on all

1461
01:34:28,911 --> 01:34:33,911
sides had stampeded the mounts while the
men were fighting dismounted from every

1462
01:34:34,131 --> 01:34:34,760
direction.

1463
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:38,990
Hordes of crazed Indians must have
attacked with the wild courage that their

1464
01:34:38,991 --> 01:34:41,300
desperation and hate gave them.

1465
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:42,670
Okay.

1466
01:34:42,670 --> 01:34:44,950
Nothing could check their mad charges.

1467
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:50,140
Captain Dentine found a bit of wood,
hollowed out a whole,

1468
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:51,640
found an empty shell,

1469
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:56,560
wrote customer's name on a bit of paper
and placed it in the shell and shoved

1470
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:58,580
the deep in hole in a piece of wood.

1471
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,970
Then he pushed this into the
ground at customer's head.

1472
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:07,190
He would make sure that the burial
party would identify Custer's body.

1473
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:14,370
The following morning we went back to
Custer hill and buried as well as we could

1474
01:35:14,371 --> 01:35:17,310
the naked mutilated
bodies of our comrades.

1475
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:20,100
It was a gruesome task.

1476
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:22,500
Okay.

1477
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:27,000
Custer may have made a mistake to divide
his command that Sunday afternoon of

1478
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:31,020
June 25th but the gods
themselves were against him.

1479
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:35,340
It was the Indians.
Day

1480
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:46,060
eight I'm going to go back to finish this
up to the section of the book that we

1481
01:35:46,951 --> 01:35:51,951
started at and that is this account
from major reno who we know a little bit

1482
01:35:52,951 --> 01:35:53,870
more about now,

1483
01:35:55,110 --> 01:35:55,943
but

1484
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,890
I think that the way he wraps it up
and they actually did a massive trial,

1485
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:07,130
a big trial for Reno,

1486
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,820
and they found that the actions
that he took were not negligent.

1487
01:36:11,330 --> 01:36:14,720
He might've made some calls that might
not have been the best tactical to calls

1488
01:36:14,721 --> 01:36:15,770
if you look back on it.
Yeah.

1489
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:18,940
But he,

1490
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,760
he was basically cleared
of any wrong doing clearly.

1491
01:36:25,090 --> 01:36:27,520
Clearly I think it's pretty clear
that wind off thinks, you know,

1492
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:32,580
he broke and he lost control of his
troops and then Ben teen kind of took over

1493
01:36:33,581 --> 01:36:36,540
and got things squared
away. Okay. Clearly,

1494
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:39,710
clearly wind off was also
a huge fan of venting,

1495
01:36:39,770 --> 01:36:42,250
so he might be spinning that story
a little bit in that direction.

1496
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:45,460
But I do think that Reno,

1497
01:36:45,850 --> 01:36:49,420
I think that him looking back on
the incident and he kind of wraps up

1498
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:54,970
his assessment of what happened
and what went wrong that day.

1499
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:57,550
And also I think for
lack of a better word,

1500
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,880
that there is a,

1501
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:05,740
if there's a warning of sorts in this,

1502
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,110
so here's Reno.
After much reflection,

1503
01:37:11,740 --> 01:37:15,980
I've concluded that several great
blunders where the direct causes of the

1504
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:17,380
[inaudible] massacre,

1505
01:37:18,570 --> 01:37:23,020
it is an established fact that Custer
disobeyed the orders of the general in

1506
01:37:23,021 --> 01:37:26,770
command of the expedition for instead
of waiting to meet General Gibbon and

1507
01:37:26,771 --> 01:37:29,290
General Terry on June 26 at the Rosebud,

1508
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:33,130
and then cooperate with them and their
concerted plan of action as he had been

1509
01:37:33,131 --> 01:37:36,370
directed. As soon as he struck
the trail of the Indians,

1510
01:37:36,371 --> 01:37:40,570
he followed it until he came upon
the Indian village, June 25th

1511
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:46,490
then without attempting to communicate
with either Terry or given and without

1512
01:37:46,491 --> 01:37:50,600
taking the trouble to ascertain the
strength or positions of the Indians,

1513
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:54,140
he divided his regiment into
three separate battalions,

1514
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:59,460
an act which nothing can justify and
dashed against the Indians thus recklessly

1515
01:38:00,001 --> 01:38:05,001
driving his own and my commands
into an Ambi SCADE of 5,000 sue,

1516
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:13,790
nor did cost or take into consideration
the unfed and exhausted conditions of

1517
01:38:14,581 --> 01:38:16,530
the men and his horses,

1518
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:22,490
and he entirely ignored the fact that the
Indians were key Vva and ready for the

1519
01:38:22,951 --> 01:38:24,030
attack at noon.

1520
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:28,800
Whereas it would have been an easy
matter to surprise them very early in the

1521
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,633
morning.

1522
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:35,200
The only explanation for such conduct on
the part of so brilliant and officer as

1523
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:38,840
cost are undoubtedly was otherwise,

1524
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:43,190
was his great personal ambition.

1525
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:49,260
He had fought himself partially disgraced
because he had been superseded in

1526
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:51,600
command of the expedition
by General Terry,

1527
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:55,680
and it was well known that
he was resolved, if possible,

1528
01:38:55,681 --> 01:39:00,681
to carry off all the honors of the
campaign for being in command of the only

1529
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:04,860
cavalry regiment attached
to the expedition.

1530
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:08,100
He knew the brunt of the fighting
would necessarily fall on him,

1531
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:13,280
and he made it no secret of his intention
to cut loose from Terry where there

1532
01:39:13,621 --> 01:39:18,621
was fighting to be due to be done and
to carry on the campaign on his own hook

1533
01:39:22,490 --> 01:39:24,620
absolutely insensible.
The fear.

1534
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:29,680
He was so reckless and daring in the
extreme and driven by an intense desire to

1535
01:39:29,901 --> 01:39:33,350
distinguish himself by
some brilliant exploit.

1536
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:39,170
He made his head long
dash two a horrible death

1537
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:45,740
without the most causal regard for
the maxims of military prudence.

1538
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:53,230
Even now after the lapse
of nearly 10 years,

1539
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:58,980
the horror of Custer's battlefield is
still vividly before me and the harling

1540
01:40:00,541 --> 01:40:05,541
sight of those mutilated and decomposing
bodies crowning the heights on which

1541
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:10,060
poor coster fell will linger in my memory

1542
01:40:12,040 --> 01:40:12,940
till death.

1543
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:26,930
And I think that's a pretty clear warning.

1544
01:40:28,900 --> 01:40:33,900
And of course there are military lessons
to be learned from this account of the

1545
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:40,450
battle of little big horn.
Maintain the element of surprise.

1546
01:40:41,050 --> 01:40:45,760
Keep your forces unified
as much as possible, taken,

1547
01:40:45,761 --> 01:40:49,510
maintain the high ground
to rule.

1548
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:52,840
We should always follow trust
your reconnaissance units.

1549
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:54,970
You've got them out there,
listen to them,

1550
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,310
make sure your troops are
rested and fed and have water.

1551
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:08,330
But beyond those fundamental
military tactical lessons,

1552
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:16,670
I think it becomes quite clear that there
is a another enemy that we must always

1553
01:41:17,161 --> 01:41:19,050
be on the watch for.

1554
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:21,733
Okay,

1555
01:41:22,010 --> 01:41:24,500
then that is ego,

1556
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:31,670
our own ego.
We have to keep our ego in check.

1557
01:41:31,671 --> 01:41:34,460
You have to watch out for
it and guard against it.

1558
01:41:34,461 --> 01:41:39,200
Getting control of view and interfering
with your decision making process.

1559
01:41:41,740 --> 01:41:43,990
No,
I always say this.

1560
01:41:44,050 --> 01:41:46,810
This doesn't mean that
ego should be banished.

1561
01:41:48,350 --> 01:41:52,570
It absolutely has a very
positive side as well.

1562
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:56,320
It drives us to push hard.
It drives us to do our best.

1563
01:41:57,970 --> 01:42:02,970
And a guy like Custer who personally
led cavalry charges at the battle of

1564
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:09,901
Gettysburg that were critical in stopping
flanking actions from confederate

1565
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:15,811
troops and an action that no doubt
was fueled by courage and bravery,

1566
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:23,350
but also was fueled at some level by ego

1567
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:31,170
because ego is a driver of our actions
and some times it can be a positive

1568
01:42:31,171 --> 01:42:36,000
driver of our actions,
but it has to be balanced,

1569
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:42,970
has to be balanced by humility
in open ears and an open mind.

1570
01:42:44,630 --> 01:42:46,760
Keep the ego in check,

1571
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:50,140
Anna,

1572
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:55,140
I'll tell you something else like your
ego on another lesson from this is that

1573
01:42:56,741 --> 01:43:00,370
you have to keep your emotions in check.

1574
01:43:00,371 --> 01:43:05,371
And you heard the brutality that was
committed in these wars on both sides,

1575
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:09,400
both sides,

1576
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:15,340
anger and fear and frustration.

1577
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:20,560
Those result in an
escalation on both sides.

1578
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:22,953
Okay?

1579
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:28,060
And on both sides there were
truly horrific acts of savagery.

1580
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:36,010
And that's an extreme example.

1581
01:43:36,011 --> 01:43:39,400
This whole story is an
extreme example of both those,

1582
01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:43,340
both the ego and the emotional.
May Him.

1583
01:43:45,620 --> 01:43:46,260
Okay.

1584
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:49,710
That are shown in this
example are very extreme,

1585
01:43:49,711 --> 01:43:54,230
but also think about how they
relate toward your every day life,

1586
01:43:55,890 --> 01:43:56,670
okay?

1587
01:43:56,670 --> 01:44:01,670
How often do you let your ego get in
the way of making the right decision?

1588
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:09,150
How often do you let your
emotions drive your decisions?

1589
01:44:10,750 --> 01:44:12,670
How often do you go to war

1590
01:44:14,810 --> 01:44:18,260
because of your emotions
and because of your ego?

1591
01:44:18,261 --> 01:44:21,410
How often did you go to
a war because of them?

1592
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:25,630
In what I'm saying?
Stop.

1593
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:30,420
Stop doing that.

1594
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,970
Get control of your emotions and get
control of your ego and put them in check

1595
01:44:35,971 --> 01:44:40,971
so you aren't escalating to situations
where you savage your enemy or your

1596
01:44:42,571 --> 01:44:46,410
friends or your coworkers or your
peers or your family or whoever.

1597
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:50,580
You do nothing in those situations
to further your mission in life.

1598
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:57,440
But instead you just distract and
detract from reaching your real goals.

1599
01:45:01,450 --> 01:45:03,070
Don't let that happen.

1600
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:08,620
Learn burn from this particular battle.

1601
01:45:08,621 --> 01:45:12,700
See what the emotions and ego do.

1602
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:15,683
Okay.

1603
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:20,250
And find a better way.
Deescalate

1604
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:27,050
the build coalitions with people
instead of building blood feuds.

1605
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:35,560
Work with people instead
of working against people.

1606
01:45:35,690 --> 01:45:39,800
Lift people up instead
of casting them down.

1607
01:45:42,890 --> 01:45:47,840
And in short, what that is, is leading.

1608
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:54,010
That is what true leadership is and
that is what a true leader does.

1609
01:45:56,210 --> 01:45:57,043
Okay.

1610
01:45:57,970 --> 01:46:00,940
So go out there

1611
01:46:03,100 --> 01:46:03,933
and do it.

1612
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:13,930
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1613
01:46:14,950 --> 01:46:16,540
Just a,
just a brutal,

1614
01:46:17,260 --> 01:46:20,860
brutal situation that this is,

1615
01:46:22,260 --> 01:46:24,340
I actually pull up some other quotes too.

1616
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,390
In the beginning of the book,

1617
01:46:28,391 --> 01:46:31,130
I talk about some of these
massacres that were considered, uh,

1618
01:46:31,690 --> 01:46:35,200
committed by the soldiers.
Yeah. In some of these raids.

1619
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:40,960
And this is one right here,
John S.

1620
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,490
Smith from his congressional testimony.
This is from the sand creek massacre,

1621
01:46:45,491 --> 01:46:49,030
by the way. I saw the bodies of
those lying there cut all the,

1622
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:50,580
okay.

1623
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:53,220
Worst mutilated than
any I ever saw before.

1624
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:58,430
The women cut to pieces with knives
scalped their brains knocked out children

1625
01:46:58,830 --> 01:47:00,150
two or three months old.

1626
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:00,980
Okay.

1627
01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:05,980
All ages lying there from
sucking infants up to warriors

1628
01:47:08,830 --> 01:47:10,600
by whom?
Where they mutilated

1629
01:47:12,780 --> 01:47:14,670
by United States troops.

1630
01:47:17,330 --> 01:47:18,000
Okay.

1631
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,860
In the, again, this might,

1632
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:24,890
my point in bringing that up is that
it's the escalation of emotions and the

1633
01:47:27,471 --> 01:47:30,650
escalation of ego.
And I'm going to pay them back.

1634
01:47:30,651 --> 01:47:34,940
And we so often drive ourselves to
these situations in everyday life.

1635
01:47:34,941 --> 01:47:36,560
I mean obviously not to this scale.

1636
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:38,120
Okay.

1637
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,200
But how do we overcome that?

1638
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:44,330
And I think you got to concentrate on
keeping your ego and your emotions in

1639
01:47:44,331 --> 01:47:47,510
check. Yeah. Yeah.

1640
01:47:47,511 --> 01:47:51,080
And there's also that
slippery slope factor where

1641
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:56,940
like remember the the one I think it was,
I think it was me lie,

1642
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:01,560
where we're talking about the slippery
slope in kind of one thing leads to

1643
01:48:01,561 --> 01:48:05,730
another where if you kind of look at the
end, the result, you're like, no way.

1644
01:48:05,731 --> 01:48:08,250
I would never do that.
I will never be in that situation.

1645
01:48:09,810 --> 01:48:14,220
But it starts like with one little
thing, you know? So from one step to the,

1646
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:18,000
to the next step or the for one little
step where you slide or on the slippery

1647
01:48:18,001 --> 01:48:22,590
slope, it's like, that's easy.
You know, where it's like,
all right, one guy gets mad,

1648
01:48:22,591 --> 01:48:26,370
he slaps this guy, you know? Or even,

1649
01:48:26,371 --> 01:48:28,560
I mean it goes really with
anything with a slippery slope.

1650
01:48:28,650 --> 01:48:32,580
Anything like cheating on your
diet, I don't know. It does.

1651
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:37,110
And what we're really talk about is
what's the cure to the slippery slope?

1652
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:38,280
It's the discipline plan.
Yeah.

1653
01:48:38,281 --> 01:48:41,070
It's maintaining the discipline is
maintaining the personal discipline.

1654
01:48:41,071 --> 01:48:41,701
What you're talking about,

1655
01:48:41,701 --> 01:48:45,240
like how it's a slippery slope going
down the doughnut slope. Yeah. Right.

1656
01:48:45,241 --> 01:48:49,680
We don't want to do that. But on top of
that, you get into a leadership situation.

1657
01:48:49,740 --> 01:48:53,370
Absolutely. It's a slippery slope and
you give that little bit, you think,

1658
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:56,940
you know it's no big deal. I liked that
guy. Hey, he's got, he got a little angry.

1659
01:48:57,150 --> 01:48:58,170
That's okay.

1660
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:02,370
But everybody else saw that happen and
now you're just allowing this to happen

1661
01:49:02,371 --> 01:49:06,300
and it's only going to escalate.
But it's so I think about this,

1662
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:09,930
think about easy it is to stop
that one thing and say, hey, echo,

1663
01:49:10,170 --> 01:49:12,690
what are you doing? Come over here.
Hey look, we don't hit prisoners.

1664
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:16,590
Stop what you're doing. Get it
together. If you're mad, go over there.

1665
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:19,650
Take a breath. Yeah. That's
pretty easy for me to stop.

1666
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:23,370
Now what happens when you shoot
somebody? Now we have, you know,

1667
01:49:23,371 --> 01:49:25,730
we have a major incident now
you're going to jail. I mean it's,

1668
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:27,030
it's a totally different thing.

1669
01:49:27,031 --> 01:49:31,650
I could've stopped that very
easily in the beginning. Yeah. Or

1670
01:49:32,500 --> 01:49:36,810
I can have major issues to deal
with in the end. Yeah. Like this.

1671
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,060
I mean this is more of like
the slippery slope situation,

1672
01:49:40,061 --> 01:49:44,170
but not war or nothing like that. But you
know how like, I dunno financial guys,

1673
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:48,070
right? They'll, there'll be
like, hey, going to do in Vr,

1674
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:51,820
I don't know, investments. You know, you
hear about this where there'll be like,

1675
01:49:51,821 --> 01:49:54,820
okay, I'm going to collect this
money from my, my, you know,

1676
01:49:54,821 --> 01:49:58,060
my clients and then I'm going
to invest it. Right. And then,

1677
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,390
Hey, I'm just going to grab this little
bit. I'll pay it right back. You know,

1678
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:06,820
next thing you know, you're going to level
seven Ponzi scheme. Yeah. They see that.

1679
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:09,790
And that's the thing that's a
slippery slope where when you start,

1680
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:14,140
even before you like start
to slip or whatever, when
you start your, you think of,

1681
01:50:14,141 --> 01:50:14,351
okay,

1682
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:19,351
where am right now and going to prison
for the Ponzi so you never would have no

1683
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:24,160
way I'm going to, you know,
I've seen other guys do.

1684
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:28,660
It sounds like that would really be
the psychology of people that do that.

1685
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,630
Like all I bet a lot. Well, I don't
know cause I haven't, are you,

1686
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:35,170
is this a specific example that you read
about or something or you just kind of

1687
01:50:35,171 --> 01:50:38,320
assuming that that's what the
mindset is? Yeah. Well, um,

1688
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,980
I had read about like the slippery
slope situation, but it really,

1689
01:50:41,981 --> 01:50:43,240
it's like two perspectives.

1690
01:50:43,241 --> 01:50:48,241
One is like when you're in the mix and
the the next step or down the slippery

1691
01:50:49,181 --> 01:50:53,460
slope, the is always totally
understandable, right? No
one's going to run, know,

1692
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:57,280
sound, the alarm. I bet if you looked at
the Bernie Madoff where he has had that,

1693
01:50:58,430 --> 01:51:00,790
I, I would, I would have to read about it,

1694
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:03,820
but it would make sense to me
that your assumption is correct.

1695
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:06,070
That in the beginning he wasn't like,
you know what I'm going to do?

1696
01:51:06,190 --> 01:51:08,860
I'm going to rip off a bunch of people.
I met at the beginning, you said,

1697
01:51:08,861 --> 01:51:10,090
you know what?
I got these good investments.

1698
01:51:10,091 --> 01:51:13,180
I'm going to get these people didn't
buy in. And then he goes, you know what?

1699
01:51:13,181 --> 01:51:14,830
I didn't quite make what
we were going to make,

1700
01:51:14,831 --> 01:51:17,260
but I'm just going to go ahead and take
some of these other people's money and

1701
01:51:17,261 --> 01:51:21,310
just distribute it to everyone
was kind of happy. And you know,

1702
01:51:21,880 --> 01:51:24,040
that's where it starts.
Yeah. And then you,

1703
01:51:24,041 --> 01:51:27,330
then you realize you can get away with
it and you go on down that road. Yeah.

1704
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:30,700
And that,
and that's ego by the way,

1705
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:32,590
because that's just ego
because you're like,

1706
01:51:32,620 --> 01:51:34,210
I don't want to admit to everybody that,
hey,

1707
01:51:34,211 --> 01:51:37,140
I didn't make the money I promised you
so you know what I'm going to do double

1708
01:51:37,141 --> 01:51:42,040
down, double down. But the tooth
perspectives is kind of the, the,

1709
01:51:42,041 --> 01:51:45,730
um,
the thing where when you're in the mix,

1710
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:49,300
that one step is like, that's hard
to see in a matter of speaking.

1711
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:52,630
It's hard to see, cause you're
like, Eh, why should I, you know,

1712
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:57,340
this guy came in 30 seconds late,
so what?

1713
01:51:57,341 --> 01:52:00,490
I'm going to reprimand him in front of
everyone. Come on. You know, like really,

1714
01:52:00,610 --> 01:52:03,520
you know, so no one's, you know,
that's, that's easy to understand.

1715
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:09,010
But every last employee never coming
in on time. You're like, no way.

1716
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:13,570
Impossible. No Way. When I started this,
no way I would ever let that happen.

1717
01:52:13,630 --> 01:52:17,110
But here's the thing, it will happen
with that, you know, because of that,

1718
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:19,480
because each little step is hard to see.
You can't see it.

1719
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:24,490
That's why it's like this is the rule and
straight up. So you know sticklers of,

1720
01:52:24,520 --> 01:52:27,700
you know, people like when they're
sticklers on the rules. It's kind of like,

1721
01:52:28,060 --> 01:52:31,570
I guess made me, me like socially the
norm is like, hey, he's a stickler,

1722
01:52:31,571 --> 01:52:35,020
he's a Tightwad, whatever, you
know. But I will say this though,

1723
01:52:35,021 --> 01:52:37,630
you said that there is
also the way to lead,

1724
01:52:37,631 --> 01:52:41,890
like when you heard about Benton Benton
want to call the guy out like that,

1725
01:52:42,430 --> 01:52:44,710
but he would have just given
him a look. Right? Right.

1726
01:52:44,830 --> 01:52:45,870
Don't you think it's a good idea?

1727
01:52:45,871 --> 01:52:48,660
Don't you think it's really
important that we are on time? Yeah.

1728
01:52:48,740 --> 01:52:51,590
You don't want to call them out in
front of everybody or I permitted him,

1729
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:54,380
but he still would have been a leader.
You still would've led and that's,

1730
01:52:54,530 --> 01:52:57,870
that's the, that's what
we want to do. Yeah. Yeah.

1731
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:02,290
So I guess we'll uh,
yeah,

1732
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:05,720
save the questions from the
interwebs for next time.

1733
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:11,630
He native American names at the coolest
man. They do have the coolest names.

1734
01:53:11,810 --> 01:53:16,780
But if I, if, if I had another son, I
think I named him bloody knife. No. Right.

1735
01:53:16,781 --> 01:53:21,320
Or what was the other one in the
family. One stab. Yeah. Yeah. Dad.

1736
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:24,710
Yeah. Native Americans definitely
knew how to put their names together.

1737
01:53:24,711 --> 01:53:28,310
And so what, like what's the,
what's the formula? It's like Oh,

1738
01:53:28,330 --> 01:53:31,260
some significant thing that this guy
did and we'll just call them. No,

1739
01:53:31,290 --> 01:53:32,330
you remember,
wouldn't like,

1740
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:36,860
cause his name was each from the hand
and then they changed it from each,

1741
01:53:36,890 --> 01:53:39,170
I think it was each from his
hand or each from the hand.

1742
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:44,160
Once he proved that he was actually
a, a, a Badass Warrior, his dad said,

1743
01:53:44,260 --> 01:53:46,460
cause he had,
he had requested the name from,

1744
01:53:47,370 --> 01:53:49,970
from his uncle because they could
both win. They could both walk,

1745
01:53:50,540 --> 01:53:52,760
they could both walk the
distance long and never give up.

1746
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:57,580
And so he requested that name and
when a, once they fought it, the bid,

1747
01:53:57,590 --> 01:54:01,130
little big horn, he introduced
his son as, this is my son,

1748
01:54:01,160 --> 01:54:04,280
wouldn't like my,
uh,

1749
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:08,120
Sarah before they were like,
Hey,

1750
01:54:08,690 --> 01:54:11,960
I wonder how the native Americans
get their name. I know how they just,

1751
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:15,650
when they do something significant,
they just, they just give it to them.

1752
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:18,410
They don't make up a name surrounding
it. That's their name, what they do.

1753
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:22,640
So her friend Abby,
she smoked a lot at the time.

1754
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:27,590
So her name was Abby smokes
a lot. The legitimately, no,

1755
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,620
oh, that's her native
American name. But, but the,

1756
01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:34,340
in the warrior culture it's way
cooler. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1757
01:54:35,180 --> 01:54:37,040
I like dances with wolves.

1758
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:41,540
I mean that's probably not where your
culture then you ever seen that movie

1759
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:45,560
dancing? I have seen that movie, but it
was a long time ago. That was when I went,

1760
01:54:45,561 --> 01:54:48,620
still went to movies before.
I just found them all kind of lame

1761
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:54,260
old school for sure.
Yeah. All right. Um, well

1762
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:58,040
I guess with that,

1763
01:54:59,300 --> 01:55:04,070
how about you talk about
how we can get in the game,

1764
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:08,360
getting the game, the game and
still a little support the podcast.

1765
01:55:08,361 --> 01:55:11,020
Maybe it would be nice to
learn how to enforcement.

1766
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:15,200
If you want to support the podcast,
you can do it and this is how, yeah,

1767
01:55:15,230 --> 01:55:19,670
there's some cool ways. Um,
if you don't know already,

1768
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:25,520
I would say with supporting this podcast,

1769
01:55:25,670 --> 01:55:29,860
support yourself. That's, I think that
because if you're incapable, how are,

1770
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:30,171
you know,

1771
01:55:30,171 --> 01:55:32,460
if you're not capable of supporting
yourself humping to support podcast,

1772
01:55:32,720 --> 01:55:36,260
how can you support us with that?
By the way,

1773
01:55:36,261 --> 01:55:38,930
we got mixed reviews
from the last podcast.

1774
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:42,470
I had said something along the lines
of, hey, does this take too long?

1775
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:45,610
Actually I did. We didn't get mixed
reviews. I think the only roof,

1776
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,400
the only reviews we got were positive.

1777
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:49,860
Now there might be some people that just
didn't say anything because they were

1778
01:55:49,861 --> 01:55:53,880
trying to be kind and gentle. Yeah. So
that's fine. They press stop right now.

1779
01:55:54,360 --> 01:55:59,360
The rest of the people that are kind
of like the little deep in the game,

1780
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:04,030
they're deepen the game. Yeah,
that's a good, well, in a way I,

1781
01:56:04,031 --> 01:56:08,040
and there were some good points that
they brought up because, um, oh,

1782
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:12,300
I forget who said it, but they were like,
there's some nuggets in there. Yeah. No,

1783
01:56:12,301 --> 01:56:15,690
we don't stop trying to learn.
Yeah.

1784
01:56:15,780 --> 01:56:19,500
While we're talking about things
that help us. Right. Correct.

1785
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:21,660
We were still trying to
figure some stuff out. Yeah.

1786
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:26,580
There's some nuggets of information to
share that might be dropped at any time.

1787
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:29,310
Yeah.
And even if not,

1788
01:56:29,340 --> 01:56:33,690
that's part of the reason why
I put the guide, you know,

1789
01:56:33,780 --> 01:56:37,530
on Youtube. Oh yeah. This is, you guys
are done talking about this stuff,

1790
01:56:37,531 --> 01:56:41,430
so just turn it off. Oh, the
whatever the, the Internet stuff.

1791
01:56:41,580 --> 01:56:42,740
I'll just skip that part.
Yeah.

1792
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,430
You can skip it and it'll tell you where
to skip too. So both options are there.

1793
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:48,323
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1794
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:52,260
Because some people might just want to
take everything they can from the podcast.

1795
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:56,760
That's why I put, um, you know, the
timestamp for all the subjects because,

1796
01:56:58,360 --> 01:57:00,180
you know,
look,

1797
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:03,690
I like to assume that
every 100% of the people,

1798
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:06,420
everybody 10 out of 10,

1799
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:13,280
like every single word of that, and they
like every single subject and they like,

1800
01:57:13,290 --> 01:57:17,370
I would, I like, I like to think that, but
in the event of that not being the case,

1801
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:21,150
I don't want them to be all this while
I got to sit through echo talking about,

1802
01:57:21,270 --> 01:57:25,350
you know, Amazon Click throughs and on
it, you know, so they have the option.

1803
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:28,560
I think that's important. Yeah. We're
all here. We're working together.

1804
01:57:28,561 --> 01:57:31,260
I feel like we're all in this together.
You know, we don't need the one guy being,

1805
01:57:31,261 --> 01:57:34,050
hey, I have a different opinion
than you. I have that. Right.

1806
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:37,140
And then now I've got to sit through
this stuff that you guys like what I'm

1807
01:57:37,141 --> 01:57:41,910
saying. Well, I think we're taking care
of both sides in sure. So, and to do that,

1808
01:57:41,911 --> 01:57:43,230
you know, of course, like I said,

1809
01:57:43,260 --> 01:57:46,050
you support yourself
supplementation if you're into it.

1810
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:50,340
And here's the thing where I didn't
think that like Krill oil with

1811
01:57:50,341 --> 01:57:54,390
supplementation. Here's the thing. It is,
and it helps cause that's cause you're,

1812
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,610
you're now on the chrome
on the Krill oil and it,

1813
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:59,430
and I have reaped its benefits and um,
my,

1814
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:04,380
my wife's dad was talking about Krill
oil from, oh, fish oil, no, not fish oil.

1815
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:08,100
Fish oil is good. Don't get me wrong.
It's outstanding. It's just, you know,

1816
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:11,520
what's better? Krill oil is what he would
say on a time. And I'm like, Eh, yeah,

1817
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:13,770
yeah. He's kind of, you know,
one of these health like guys

1818
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:20,800
and I'm the old message.
No marriage. Yeah. So, um,

1819
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:23,910
yeah, Krill oil from, from on it. Of
course. That's it. That's the main one.

1820
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:28,500
They have like the quality,
the quality stuff, cheap stuff.

1821
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:32,130
No, don't. And He, one
might think, oh yeah,

1822
01:58:32,131 --> 01:58:34,950
of course I'm not going to go get the
cheap stuff, but here's the thing.

1823
01:58:34,951 --> 01:58:37,530
And slept with supplements.
Like there is cheap stuff.

1824
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,540
There's like stuff that
straight up doesn't work.

1825
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:43,720
Like you might as well be taking
chop condensed into pills. It's true.

1826
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:48,850
Absolutely true. Chalk you said? Yeah.
Okay. Don't do that. Cause it's not like,

1827
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:51,450
I don't know something about it
being a supplement. It's not rigged.

1828
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:55,090
I Dunno something, but on it is all
legit, like it has the literature,

1829
01:58:55,091 --> 01:58:57,670
all that stuff like where they get it.
Even the Krill oil is like,

1830
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:02,760
you're so excited about where the Krill
oil comes from. Always. That's a deal.

1831
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,420
Like I said,
we're all that.

1832
01:59:04,660 --> 01:59:09,240
You're about to tell us
about the environmental
friendly ships. You love that.

1833
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:13,020
That was kind of a cool video
too. You can see. No, I liked it.

1834
01:59:13,021 --> 01:59:15,710
That obviously left an impression
on you and for you to say something,

1835
01:59:15,711 --> 01:59:17,730
it's a cool video.
That's a pretty good compliment.

1836
01:59:18,110 --> 01:59:19,980
You kind of like cool
videos and make them,

1837
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,130
at least we hope I tell
myself that. Yeah, sure.

1838
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,580
Because a lot of times if we
don't make them, you don't make,

1839
01:59:27,020 --> 01:59:30,090
sometimes you make one every three
months and then how do we feel about that

1840
01:59:30,210 --> 01:59:34,260
there? We don't feel really good about
it yet. All right. There you go. I mean,

1841
01:59:34,280 --> 01:59:37,330
I'm okay. You know, I
take your point fully,

1842
01:59:38,170 --> 01:59:42,220
but back to the Krill oil.
It's good. Anyway. What else?

1843
01:59:42,221 --> 01:59:46,960
Nick Krill oil warrior bars.
The shroom tech for performance.

1844
01:59:47,050 --> 01:59:51,670
You know, if you, if you want the edge,
that sounds like kind of commercially,

1845
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,050
but for real, if you want the edge, if
you want to get the edge, if you want,

1846
01:59:56,290 --> 01:59:59,890
you can alpha brain to elephant brain,
go and get them to work in mental edge.

1847
01:59:59,891 --> 02:00:03,340
Yeah. Anyway. And you can get 10%
off. You can support your wallet,

1848
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:08,940
which is good to go to [inaudible]
dot com slash Jocko the home.

1849
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:14,230
Also. Cool way, good way, legit
way. It doesn't cost you anything.

1850
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:19,290
Way To support this podcast reinforces
vodcasts and be in the game.

1851
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:23,770
Let's face it, it's much better to be
in the game, the game fully in here.

1852
02:00:23,771 --> 02:00:28,460
How's this, and this is on a side
note from this. Um, so you know,

1853
02:00:28,461 --> 02:00:29,890
like you know,

1854
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:33,940
like people will go to like a
motivational seminar or something.

1855
02:00:34,190 --> 02:00:37,720
You don't like this or, or, or
listen to a motivational speech.

1856
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:40,260
My motivational seminar
would be three minutes long.

1857
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:46,750
So there's this like party brain where
you know it's seek something and then you

1858
02:00:46,751 --> 02:00:47,770
get the payoff and then it's,

1859
02:00:47,771 --> 02:00:52,240
it's basically a sense of satisfaction
so you can seek no more. So you're,

1860
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:56,950
you're satisfied. So people
seeking inspiration and motivation,

1861
02:00:56,951 --> 02:00:57,491
they'll go in,

1862
02:00:57,491 --> 02:01:02,491
they'll go to a speech or a seminar or
something like this and they'll consume

1863
02:01:03,761 --> 02:01:07,870
the speech or the motivational video or
whatever. But they're spectating there.

1864
02:01:07,930 --> 02:01:10,960
Yeah, they're watching it. Inspecting,
yeah, the speech. Sure. Yeah.

1865
02:01:10,961 --> 02:01:13,750
So the whole lot different.
Really the big picture should be,

1866
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:16,870
I'm going to get to see this
speech, motivation, video, whatever.

1867
02:01:17,290 --> 02:01:20,290
I'm going to be inspired, motivated.
Now I'm going to go take action, right.

1868
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:23,710
But to take action, you still
have to have a need, you know,

1869
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:28,540
that needs to be satisfied. But people,
they'll come, they'll view or, or, or,

1870
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:30,730
you know, whatever, consume the speech

1871
02:01:32,530 --> 02:01:34,980
and they will be satisfied because they,

1872
02:01:35,020 --> 02:01:38,140
they see the speech and they don't
take action. And here's the thing,

1873
02:01:38,890 --> 02:01:42,350
the next speech that comes into town or
the next motivational video on youtube,

1874
02:01:42,351 --> 02:01:45,950
you know, how does the next one or
the next time, whoever the person is,

1875
02:01:45,951 --> 02:01:49,640
I don't know, Tony Robbins or whoever,
next time they're coming to town,

1876
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:51,980
they're going to go for that good
stuff that they got last time.

1877
02:01:52,370 --> 02:01:55,250
They left a real satisfied
with, you know, getting to see,

1878
02:01:55,251 --> 02:01:58,310
hearing that and you know, viewing
that speech, they go, they do it again.

1879
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:01,930
They get that sense. Satisfaction still
taking no action by the way. Not Good.

1880
02:02:02,300 --> 02:02:04,340
So it's like it's a weird,
it's a messed up cycle.

1881
02:02:04,341 --> 02:02:05,660
I think the big difference there is,

1882
02:02:05,810 --> 02:02:10,540
and that's is that those
literally you're watching. Yeah.

1883
02:02:10,610 --> 02:02:14,980
And you're spectating as opposed
to getting in the game. Yeah.

1884
02:02:15,050 --> 02:02:19,960
And see that's it. That's my really
my whole point where you know,

1885
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:23,510
I'm going to listen to you.
You're not saying like,

1886
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:26,780
I mean you're saying get after,
but you're not saying you can do it.

1887
02:02:26,870 --> 02:02:29,910
You're not saying that kind of stuff.
You know, like I know it goes by,

1888
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,410
I'm actually, I'm actually not saying
you can do it. I'm actually saying do it.

1889
02:02:34,430 --> 02:02:38,630
Yeah, exactly right. But that's the
thing. So really the whole message,

1890
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:42,830
whatever it may be, you know,
I don't know. Big, don't eat
donuts. All this stuff is,

1891
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:48,080
the big message here is don't eat donuts.
I think it's a bunch of messages,

1892
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:52,640
but the key there to them,
the whole message is you got to do it.

1893
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:56,000
It's not like you can do it, you know,
and you're like, Hey, I can do it.

1894
02:02:56,001 --> 02:02:57,560
I feel good about that fact.
I'm good.

1895
02:02:58,010 --> 02:03:01,370
But this is like you gotta do you
gotta go out and do that? You know,

1896
02:03:01,371 --> 02:03:05,210
you can't just walk. You can just
watch. Okay. I think I'm convinced.

1897
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:10,220
I'm saying that's the difference.
And so you're saying that Amazon,

1898
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:14,010
the Amazon shopping, click
through the website, Jocko,

1899
02:03:14,011 --> 02:03:17,000
podcast.com little Amazon link.
It definitely helps.

1900
02:03:17,180 --> 02:03:22,180
And also we're all going to be
all up on Amazon for Christmas,

1901
02:03:23,420 --> 02:03:24,800
for the holiday season,

1902
02:03:25,070 --> 02:03:27,980
for whatever it is you're
going to celebrate when
school's off for two weeks and

1903
02:03:27,981 --> 02:03:31,310
you got to buy a bunch of people
presence yet during that time period.

1904
02:03:31,850 --> 02:03:34,640
That's a good time to support the podcast.
It doesn't cost you anything.

1905
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:38,370
You Click through Amazon and you make
your purchases. The key there is to,

1906
02:03:38,380 --> 02:03:41,510
to remember it like you need some
kind of queue put in your bookmarks or

1907
02:03:41,511 --> 02:03:45,200
something. Done some kind of cute.
That's good. That's the key right there.

1908
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:47,750
I think the rest is just,
it just kind of, you know,

1909
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:52,190
it takes care of itself anyway.
And then you can subscribe of course,

1910
02:03:52,191 --> 02:03:56,910
on iTunes and Youtube and stitcher.

1911
02:03:58,170 --> 02:04:03,060
Google play. Yep. Yeah. Wherever you
might get your podcast from. Subscribe.

1912
02:04:03,150 --> 02:04:07,780
Yeah. Just subscribe. Write a
review. Right. A review. Yeah. Yeah.

1913
02:04:07,781 --> 02:04:11,260
Those are good men. Their reviews.
Yeah. Those are just, those are solid.

1914
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:16,320
I like when people get creative.
I encourage that for sure.

1915
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:22,500
Um, and then of course, of
course. Look, if you wear tee
shirts, if you wear hoodies,

1916
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:28,570
drink coffee or tea of any kind

1917
02:04:30,380 --> 02:04:35,290
or white teeth anyway, Jocko, store.com
you can buy some cool shirts. Uh,

1918
02:04:35,291 --> 02:04:37,860
if you think they're cool,
you look at them,

1919
02:04:39,820 --> 02:04:42,430
there's going to be more to them
than meets the eye looking at a,

1920
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:46,450
but if you like how they look,
maybe look into down, but here,

1921
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:49,600
here's the thing though. I, you know, I'm
making like a so mysterious like, Ooh,

1922
02:04:49,601 --> 02:04:52,360
there's all these layers. How I
always say, yeah. Then the Hoodie,

1923
02:04:53,230 --> 02:04:55,960
one side says discipline other
sites. This freedom, if you look,

1924
02:04:55,961 --> 02:05:00,230
if you pay attention, there's a little
equal sign and it's a barcode. Yup.

1925
02:05:00,850 --> 02:05:04,750
That's made into equals sign. Someone
hit me on Twitter and said, hey,

1926
02:05:04,751 --> 02:05:08,410
you're talking about the layers. Is
this equal sign a layer, you know? Yeah.

1927
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:10,030
Like is this a little hidden thing?

1928
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:12,203
Yeah.

1929
02:05:12,770 --> 02:05:15,520
Hey, you're going to leave us here in
suspense. Yeah. It is a hidden thing.

1930
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,380
It's not that big of a deal, but it's
a small deal. It's like a double,

1931
02:05:20,381 --> 02:05:24,430
like the, okay, here.
Here it is. So the font,

1932
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:28,840
right? Yes. Jocko chose the font.
Yes. It would be for any of this.

1933
02:05:28,841 --> 02:05:31,360
Things started talking with chose the fun.
Yeah,

1934
02:05:31,361 --> 02:05:35,200
because I made the Jocko podcast.
You,

1935
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:38,260
despite you being a massive,
you know,

1936
02:05:38,320 --> 02:05:43,320
skills with all those programs that
do all the design and you have a great

1937
02:05:43,541 --> 02:05:47,170
graphics mind and all that stuff. Despite
all that, I just made this little thing,

1938
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:52,300
a little Jocko podcast symbol and I made
it on PowerPoint and when it came time

1939
02:05:53,021 --> 02:05:54,460
to pick the font,

1940
02:05:55,450 --> 02:05:59,980
I chose this font called OCR,

1941
02:06:00,850 --> 02:06:03,580
optical,
something recognition.

1942
02:06:04,570 --> 02:06:08,530
Because in my mind I'm always like,
okay, part machine, I'm part machine.

1943
02:06:08,531 --> 02:06:11,740
So this font can be read by machines.
Yup.

1944
02:06:11,870 --> 02:06:15,280
That is why that is why I
use this font. Yeah. So yeah,

1945
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:17,980
you can look at that at the,
I don't know if you told me to look it up,

1946
02:06:17,981 --> 02:06:20,350
but you said it, you're like, oh
yeah, it's cool. It's like, Oh Dang.

1947
02:06:20,351 --> 02:06:22,420
So I looked it up and yeah,
sure enough,

1948
02:06:23,130 --> 02:06:26,860
it's the first point that they made
that computers can. Yes, that's right.

1949
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:31,340
That is what it is. That's why I chose
it. I'm like, this guy's a deep cool. My,

1950
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:34,560
all right,
so the Barcode,

1951
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,163
okay.

1952
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:40,710
Yes. Another thing that computer's going
to be reading your shirt kind of thing.

1953
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:44,850
You're not machine. Yeah. Well, you're
wearing them. You're a machine readable.

1954
02:06:44,990 --> 02:06:47,550
You're a machine. Yes, yes,
you're wearing, that's what it is.

1955
02:06:47,930 --> 02:06:50,430
You can't get rid by computer.
So that's kind of the little late.

1956
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:54,840
I mean that's just more of
like a fun thing for sure.
Small layer. Um, but anyway,

1957
02:06:54,841 --> 02:06:58,650
uh, again Jocko store, that's
where all the stuff is. Cool.

1958
02:06:58,651 --> 02:07:03,510
Rash guards that, hey man, we
made the claim 19% improvement.

1959
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:07,230
That is yet to be refuted so far.
You know,

1960
02:07:07,231 --> 02:07:09,570
as far as feedback that
I've been getting anyway,

1961
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,360
if you want your improvement because
you know what, you know what though?

1962
02:07:12,361 --> 02:07:15,420
I think that there is
legitimacy like actually full,

1963
02:07:15,421 --> 02:07:18,780
somebody put an article on today about
how it compresses the muscle increases

1964
02:07:18,781 --> 02:07:21,540
circulation so you actually
get the legit improvement.

1965
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:26,620
I don't know all the science behind
it, you know, but bro Science, no,

1966
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:29,220
but you know what is, you know how you
were saying, you know when you put on like

1967
02:07:31,080 --> 02:07:35,380
a uniform oh yeah.
You or you get a little yes as a ritual.

1968
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:38,890
Back to the ritual conversation
kind of. And it's like, almost like,

1969
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:41,410
it's weird,
like when I was young,

1970
02:07:41,411 --> 02:07:44,620
when I played football at 11
years old and we've got new shoes,

1971
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:47,710
football season's here, new shoes.
Oh, I couldn't wait to go to practice.

1972
02:07:48,250 --> 02:07:52,480
I'm going to be faster few months, man.
My shoes are dirty. I hate practice.

1973
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:56,170
But you get new shoes, you want to go
practice, you get new workout gear.

1974
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:59,650
You're like, Dang, I'm going go. You get
a new rash guard, you want to go train.

1975
02:07:59,651 --> 02:08:00,970
And you knew, right? You get a new Geek,

1976
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:06,450
you want to try it. Yeah. So that's
kind of, that's maybe a factor as well.

1977
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:11,370
There's a little plastic. Oh yeah. Plus
Placebo. Sorry. Yeah, placebo factor.

1978
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:15,930
Yeah. And that's, I call
it getting after it.

1979
02:08:16,730 --> 02:08:19,570
So chocolate [inaudible] dot com uh,
w some women's stuff,

1980
02:08:19,571 --> 02:08:23,940
some women's tee shirts
coming out soon. Oh, we now,

1981
02:08:23,941 --> 02:08:26,970
now that you say that, they
better be actually coming
out. So, you know, I think my,

1982
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,760
my clock is counting down my Debbie clock.

1983
02:08:29,970 --> 02:08:34,740
Debbie gave me like a countdown mine
straight up dead. Right. You know,

1984
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:37,080
she gave me one month,
she's leading up the chain of command.

1985
02:08:37,970 --> 02:08:39,440
Respect you respect on though.

1986
02:08:39,530 --> 02:08:44,530
But you can also get some Jocko white
tea if you want to drink some tea.

1987
02:08:45,930 --> 02:08:48,270
That tastes really good.
If you haven't tried it yet,

1988
02:08:48,330 --> 02:08:51,720
it doesn't taste like tea and it
doesn't taste like anything else.

1989
02:08:51,930 --> 02:08:55,620
It tastes like something really good.
So give it a shot.

1990
02:08:55,980 --> 02:09:00,980
And a lot of people have replaced every
other beverage in their diet with Jocko

1991
02:09:02,251 --> 02:09:03,084
white tea.

1992
02:09:03,120 --> 02:09:06,240
And on top of that we've got a little
something new coming out that can be used

1993
02:09:06,270 --> 02:09:11,270
for tea or for coffee or
for milk or for cream.

1994
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:15,900
And it's a big old mug. So those
would be on Amazon. And the Mug,

1995
02:09:16,440 --> 02:09:17,760
it's just a big black mug.

1996
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And then written on the Mug
is just says get after it.

1997
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:27,300
So Yep, you can, you can get one
of those. It also says approved.

1998
02:09:28,620 --> 02:09:30,780
It was approved in fact by me.

1999
02:09:32,100 --> 02:09:35,250
So you get those mugs
and they're pretty cool.

2000
02:09:35,550 --> 02:09:37,440
And then also you get the
book extreme ownership,

2001
02:09:37,470 --> 02:09:42,360
which I wrote with my brother
late Babin and um, pick it up.

2002
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:47,010
You know what a lot of like what I did
is when people buy it for themselves and

2003
02:09:47,011 --> 02:09:49,410
then three days later after
they get done reading it,

2004
02:09:49,770 --> 02:09:52,920
they buy four more for the people that
are on their team and then they buy one

2005
02:09:52,921 --> 02:09:57,210
for their boss and then they buy one for
the five people that are in their peers

2006
02:09:57,211 --> 02:10:01,320
team and they just spread the word because
they want to make their life easier

2007
02:10:01,740 --> 02:10:05,460
by having people getting after it all
around them and take an extreme ownership.

2008
02:10:06,150 --> 02:10:11,130
And um, if you do want to kind

2017
02:10:45,421 --> 02:10:49,360
It's out there in uniform serving.

2018
02:10:50,650 --> 02:10:51,210
Yeah,

2019
02:10:51,210 --> 02:10:52,440

Thanks for what you do.
Thanks for your service.

2022
02:10:58,740 --> 02:11:02,280
Thanks for protecting the homeland,
folks that are overseas.

2023
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:06,840
Thank you for what you're doing.
Stay aggressive.

2024
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:08,340
Stay ahead of the enemy.

2025
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:12,640
Keep getting after it.

2026
02:11:13,690 --> 02:11:18,690
And then to all the troopers that I'm
meeting all the time in every industry,

2027
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:26,460
every industry you could imagine that
are out there making things happen,

2028
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:32,280
turning and burning day
to day crushing things,

2029
02:11:32,890 --> 02:11:37,890
whether it's so massive project that
you are completely devoted to doing and

2030
02:11:40,421 --> 02:11:42,760
doing it perfectly.
Or you know what?

2031
02:11:42,910 --> 02:11:45,850
There's plenty of people that hit me
up and they say, Hey, you know what?

2032
02:11:45,851 --> 02:11:49,870
I gotta do a bunch of stupid
administrative tasks today and guess what?

2033
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:52,810
I'm going to line them up
and I'm going to crush them.

2034
02:11:53,860 --> 02:11:56,790
So wherever you are on today,
on that Spec,

2035
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:01,090
drum line, 'em up. Okay?

2036
02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:02,413
And crush them.

2037
02:12:05,390 --> 02:12:07,160
So until next time,

2038
02:12:08,730 --> 02:12:10,860
this is echo and Jocko

2039
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:13,150
