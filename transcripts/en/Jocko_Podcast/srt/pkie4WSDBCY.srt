1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:06,210
This is Jocko podcast number
one 16 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,890
Jocko Willink. Good evening. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,530
So this then was the culmination to die.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,510
Die in the stinking mud
twice before I crossed this,

5
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:28,200
no man's land darting from
shell hole to shell hole.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,220
I'm no hero.
I was numb with fear.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,190
But this time a barrage was on.

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,590
I laid there at the
wastelands edge thinking

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,010
was there any way

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,530
to the right lay crack shot?
Snipers.

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,590
Yeah,

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,250
to the left in the brush machine.
Guns

13
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,010
hungry,
waiting

14
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,520
and fair in the front.
Great.

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:09,470
Bursting mud clouds
playing toss with bodies.

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,860
Yeah.
Get through once more sun.

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,190
The colonel had said communications down
our guns firing short killing our boys.

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,890
Yes it must be done.

19
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,070
But how?
Wait

20
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:35,340
the barrage sweeping across the field
and back a deadly windshield wiper were I

21
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:41,160
to follow it down. And when
I returned, dig in, I might

22
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,603
now

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,620
drunk with fighting fear.
I chased the mud cloud down the field,

24
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,440
kicking dead bodies,
twisting like a ghost.

25
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,150
And I laughed and I yelled,
you bastards. You can't get me

26
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,700
our trenches ahead.
Almost there.

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,860
Okay.

28
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,880
Back came hell's windshield
wiper, vomiting, death,

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,810
and I dug in,
dug in with all I had

30
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,530
mom, dear God, help me

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,440
on it. Came 40 feet,

32
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,030
20 feet.
God,

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,993
my head

34
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,850
torn from my body

35
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,450
is this what being dead is like?

36
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,240
Peace,
quiet,

37
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,190
clean,
white sheets.

38
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,370
My head must still be,
it hurts me.

39
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,190
These must be my fingers.
I can move them

40
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,320
and now a voice.
My boy

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
for you,
the war is over.

42
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,190
You hear that mom?

43
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay,

44
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,100
I'm still alive.
I did not die.

45
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,520
I'm coming home

46
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,260
and that is

47
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,533
a poem

48
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,850
that was written by a man
by the name of Ralph Moan

49
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,650
of east main,

50
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,070
who left his job as a civil
engineer in Waterville,

51
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,650
Maine to enlist in the army in 1917

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,540
okay.

53
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,750
Then he was wounded badly on that day,
but he did live

54
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,870
and he was decorated for his actions on
that day in the citation for his award

55
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:17,110
reads the president of the United
States of America authorized by act of

56
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,170
Congress nine July,

57
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,850
1918 takes pleasure in presenting the
distinguished service cross to mechanic

58
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,160
Ralph t Moen,

59
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,750
United States army for extraordinary
heroism in action while serving with

60
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,860
company K hundred and
Third Infantry Regiment.

61
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,070
26 division American Expeditionary
Force near Rayville France 26 September,

62
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,630
1918
mechanic Ramon,

63
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,230
who is detailed as a runner,

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,040
made several trips carrying
important messages across terrain,

65
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:57,730
swept by constant fire from machine guns,
snipers,

66
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,980
trench mortars and artillery.

67
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
His disregard for personal safety and
devotion to duty in the prompt delivery of

68
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:11,230
messages contributed greatly
to the success of the action.

69
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,013
Okay.

70
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,800
And Ralph Moan,
according to his family,

71
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,500
never spoke of the war to his
children or his grandchildren.

72
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,730
Okay.

73
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,950
But he did live with it

74
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,433
every day.

75
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,100
And tonight I am honored to have a guest
back on the podcast who is also wounded

76
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,434
in war,

77
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,070
but who has not let
that stop him in any way

78
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
from driving on with his mission and
his life and doing more than most people

79
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,720
could ever even imagine.

80
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,430
Mr Rob Jones,
a marine,

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,910
a wounded warrior,

82
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,210
and an inspiration to anyone that's a
lucky enough to come into contact with

83
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,550
him. Rob Jones, welcome back to the show.

84
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,741
Hey,
you know what?

85
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:19,741
It's an honor to be just a single time
guest on what I consider to be the best

86
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:26,410
podcast on the airwaves, but to be a
two time guests, purely rarefied air.

87
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:30,430
And I'm just appreciate you
guys deem me worthy of a,

88
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,780
of a second visit.
So,

89
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,580
and to be compared to that
gentleman is even greater honor. So,

90
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,111
yeah.
You know,

91
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:41,370
I read that a while back and it was one
of those things as I was reading it,

92
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,920
I was thinking, I was thinking about
you. I was thinking about, you know,

93
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,940
I was thinking about Jodi,
uh, thinking about Travis,

94
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,790
think about you guys that
were wounded bad and,

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,250
and I've heard that before.

96
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,300
It another is another book I read about
World War One where guys, they wake up,

97
00:06:57,301 --> 00:07:01,430
they think they're in heaven because
they see white sheets and they see you,

98
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,930
there's a nurse there that's talking
nicely to them and they think their dad,

99
00:07:03,931 --> 00:07:07,540
they think they're in heaven. And
that, that reminded me, you know,

100
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,040
when I read that I was thinking about you
and, and, and having waken up, you know,

101
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,520
in a, in a hospital somewhere.
And I know you actually woke up.

102
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,220
You're not supposed to wake up in Germany,
but you did.

103
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,220
No, you're not supposed to. But uh,
yeah, for whatever reason I woke up,

104
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,930
I think I need to drink a water.
So you need to hydrate. Yeah.

105
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:29,870
I'm not sure why I woke up. I
don't remember much, but, and uh,

106
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:33,660
I didn't definitely didn't see anybody
you could mistake for an angel or in this

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,950
smelled squad leader.
She's not an angel.

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,580
Well for anyone that's listening that
hasn't listened to the first time rob was

109
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:41,414
on,

110
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,570
go back and listen to episode 92 and
that's where we go through what rob went

111
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:50,450
through, how he's raised,
you know, growing up,

112
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,200
joining the Marine Corps deployment
to Iraq, deployment to Afghanistan.

113
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:58,340
And that's, that's where rob
was wounded, hit an IED and,

114
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,930
and ended up losing both legs
above the knee. But like I said,

115
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:06,140
that didn't stop rob.
And he went from that.

116
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,730
And in the podcast we,

117
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,740
we jumped really quickly through Sorta
your healing process and we jumped right

118
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:18,370
into the fact that you
were, went out, did the,

119
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:23,371
the Paralympics as a rower and we jumped
into the fact that you rode a bicycle

120
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:30,080
across America,
which is yeah.

121
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,350
Across America during the
polar vortex, by the way. Yeah.

122
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:35,450
That's all that stuff hasn't
covered in 92 but I was,

123
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:38,690
I was actually going back and I was
listening to [inaudible] 92 and I realized

124
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:41,090
that, you know, maybe it's just your,

125
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:45,140
it's your attitude that might've
might've made me kind of do this in the

126
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,000
conversation. Your attitude is like, yeah,

127
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,630
I lost both my legs and then I was just
competing in the Paralympics. You know,

128
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:55,290
you, you, you made it sound like it's
like it was like, it was easy. That's,

129
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,810
that's the way it kind of came
across in the podcast. And, and what,

130
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,240
what I wanted to do today was kind of at
least go back and talk a little with a

131
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:08,241
little bit more detail
about that process of going,

132
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,630
cause it's a long process, right? Year
and a half year for me anyway. Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,160
A year and a half of,

134
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,110
from letting the wounds heal
all the way through. You know,

135
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:19,801
where now you're,

136
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:23,430
you're competing in the Paralympics and
you're getting around in your mobile and

137
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,610
all that.
So you get back.

138
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,640
How long does it take for your wounds
because you can't do anything until your

139
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,000
wounds are healed up,
right?

140
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,050
No, I mean, well you can do some stuff.

141
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,620
You can't do anything as far as
prosthetics are confirmed, are concerned.

142
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,860
So in the beginning, you know, the,

143
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,800
the physical therapist would come in and
they just basically just had me move my

144
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,930
stumps around. And that
would be like, you know,

145
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:49,240
lift your right stump 10
times if your left one,

146
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,040
move it out and back and then that
would be it for the day or you know,

147
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,600
I could do, you know, my arms still works.

148
00:09:55,601 --> 00:09:58,930
So I would do a little pull ups on my
little trapeze bar that I had attached to

149
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,840
the, uh, the bed. But
yeah, it was, you know,

150
00:10:01,841 --> 00:10:05,050
surgeries every other day
they just come in and uh,

151
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:09,160
take me over and they would just be
this cleaning the wound out and he dead

152
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:11,410
tissue or anything that was still
left in there. They cleaned that out.

153
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:16,060
But I had these wound vac machines on
that we're just constantly sucking the

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,090
fluids out of the wounds
because they were,

155
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,880
they were open for the
first month and yeah,

156
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:27,881
so they're just like kind of suck in that
stuff out and it's just a waiting game

157
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:29,900
at that point.
I mean you're,

158
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,370
you can do some stuff like I've
figured out how to, you know,

159
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,120
it's slowly got to kind of furry,

160
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,040
figured out how to move my body around
and moved my legs around and get

161
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:39,874
comfortable.
And

162
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,060
were you getting like the phantom pains?

163
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,280
Yeah, I didn't get it as bad as Travis
had it. I never had to do, uh, uh,

164
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,730
what was it, a ketamine coma
in order. I had it som, um,

165
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,800
and they gave me this stuff called Lyrica,

166
00:10:55,801 --> 00:11:00,390
which is like a fibromyalgia
medication and I got it.

167
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,050
And I never really had it all that bad.
It's like,

168
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,420
it's pretty much at the
same level. It is, is,

169
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,290
is now where every maybe twice a day.

170
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,500
My toe will kind of like hurt pretty bad
for four or five seconds and that's it.

171
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,810
But there's some people
that have it a lot worse,

172
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,850
so I kind of lucked out with
that. But yeah, so first month,

173
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:25,350
this kind of learning how to get into
the wheelchair. Um, and you know,

174
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,850
at first I wouldn't, I couldn't, I was
so sore I couldn't really move very much.

175
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,500
And so I haven't have to have a nurse.
And whoever was in there visiting me,

176
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:37,080
if I wanted to get my wheelchair, I'd be
sitting on this little pad and I'd say,

177
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:40,500
all right, well I want to go for
a role. And then so they would,

178
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,440
the nurse would be on one side and the
other person will be on the inside and

179
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:48,060
they kind of like scoot me onto the
wheelchair and then we'd have to take the

180
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:51,750
wound vac machines and hook them onto
the wheelchair and take my catheter,

181
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:56,310
which I was very,
very protective of that Catheter Jack,

182
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,420
hang that on there. And then, uh, the
Ivy Paul would have to come with me.

183
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,290
And so then I would just kind of roll
myself around the ward a couple times

184
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:11,170
with, you know, my dad or my mom
or somebody pushing the IV pole.

185
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,250
And Yeah, just do that a couple times.
Then I'd go see my buddy Daniel,

186
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,890
because he couldn't get out of bed yet.
So I go and see,

187
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:20,080
visit him for a little bit
and I go back to my room.

188
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:24,280
And that'd be pretty much my exercise
for the day and then have a like six

189
00:12:24,281 --> 00:12:25,180
milkshakes.

190
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,970
This a eaten as much as I possibly could
to, to help with the healing process.

191
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah.

192
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Where did you go through
the whole woe is me,

193
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,090
why did this happen to me? Did
you go through that at all? And I,

194
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,180
I mean,
I know I've,

195
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:46,520
I've listened some of your stuff and
reading some of your stuff, you know,

196
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:51,521
you talk about the fact that you knew you
had to just move to like an acceptance

197
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:57,050
phase right immediately. Is that,
is that what you did? I mean,

198
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:59,060
how did you get,
look man,

199
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,100
people hate all kinds of
freaking roadblocks in life and,

200
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,180
and very few of them are as heavy of and
big of a roadblock as you hit and you

201
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:12,490
seem to power through that thing.
Like miraculously,

202
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,060
you know, I don't, I never,

203
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:21,110
I never actually entered into an extended
period that can be described as like a

204
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,470
depression or woe is me or you know,
feeling sorry for myself.

205
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,970
It would come in very short waves,
um,

206
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,980
where, you know, I'd be,

207
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,620
I'd be sitting around or I would
struggle with something maybe.

208
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,990
And then after I figured it out,

209
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:39,950
I might sit there for a couple
of minutes and be like, man, uh,

210
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,770
but that'd be about it. And then we'd be
go away after, you know, a minute or two,

211
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,880
it'd be kind of like,

212
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,910
uh,
I

213
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
almost kind of like,
if you're,

214
00:13:48,841 --> 00:13:53,010
if you're talking to a girl in a bar
and you like your voice cracked and he's

215
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,020
just totally blow it and you look like an
idiot and then you go back to the tape,

216
00:13:57,021 --> 00:14:00,190
we were like, man, he like that. It was,

217
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,450
it was almost kind of like that
or just like, man, how did I,

218
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,440
how did I miss that IED?
You know, man, this sucks.

219
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,120
But, and I, you know, I
didn't really think about it
probably this way at the time.

220
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:14,490
I couldn't articulate it at the
time like this, but it's like

221
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,713
that.

222
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,960
Whether or not, you know, I
deserved, I, I, you know, I did,

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,420
I could acknowledge I didn't deserve it.
I didn't deserve to be a double ibt.

224
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,450
I didn't, uh, it wasn't, you know, fair.

225
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,300
There's a lot of other guys that were
running around in that same exact area.

226
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:33,650
They didn't step on it, so it wasn't
necessarily fair that I had to be in, uh,

227
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,050
nfpt I didn't want to be an amputee,
but

228
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,190
none of that mattered.
Um,

229
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,210
it did none of that had any bearing
on whether or not I want it to have an

230
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:48,240
enjoyable life. And I did. I
sat there and I was like, well,

231
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,160
what is my mission in life?

232
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,260
If you really take it to its base
level, you know, have an impact,

233
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,870
uh,
enjoy my life.

234
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,580
That doesn't change just because now I'm
an amputee and whether or not it's fair

235
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,840
or the fact that I'm starting from a,
you know,

236
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:12,260
a little bit more of a disadvantaged
position now all that stuff has no bearing

237
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,370
on whether or not I want
to accomplish my mission.

238
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:21,830
And so realizing that you just kind
of, well, what do I have to do now?

239
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,300
That stuff's in the past.

240
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:27,440
So all I can really affect
is how I react to it.

241
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,930
And you know, so I think that's kind
of how I, I skipped all that stuff.

242
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,040
Did you, I know, um, one,
one thing that I remember,

243
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,310
and you know, one of my
guys, Ryan job, he got,

244
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,920
he got shot in the face and he got
gravely wounded and you know, he,

245
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:49,390
he ended up blind and um,

246
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,410
he was down with a lot of casualties
that had guys that had really bad brain

247
00:15:57,641 --> 00:16:02,641
injuries and he was there for
a little while and you know,

248
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:06,760
these were guys that had been
severely wounded and like I said,

249
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:10,450
had severe brain injuries.
So they're having trouble communicating,

250
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:12,230
they're having trouble
with motor skills and,

251
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,240
and these are almost all the time
come with other physical injuries.

252
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,220
And you know, his attitude was, hey, look,

253
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,630
I'm taking up a bed here and we
should give it to someone else.

254
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,450
These guys are having a
much harder time than me.

255
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,030
I'm lucky because I
didn't get that injury.

256
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,020
All I got was blind and
you know, some, some,

257
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,930
some damage to my face.
But it was,

258
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,260
it was amazing to me to see
a guy like Ryan job who,

259
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:49,150
who just looked at him itself and said,
I'm lucky.

260
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,130
I'm lucky those guys
are worse off than me.

261
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:54,400
Try and give your efforts to take care
of these other guys instead of trying to

262
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,800
take care of me. I can, I can do, okay,

263
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,850
open up this bed for someone else to
send me to, uh, send me somewhere else.

264
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,100
And that's what they did. And I think
that, you know, that attitude of like,

265
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,030
Hey, this could be much worse. Right. And,

266
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,110
uh, to me, first of all,

267
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:16,570
hearing him talk about that was,

268
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:21,660
was a testament to like the spirit of a
guy that just is going to carry on and

269
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:27,091
drive on and the things that he
did before he died or was amazing.

270
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,120
You know, he graduated college
with like, with like a straight,

271
00:17:31,121 --> 00:17:35,930
a grade point average. He
got married, he, you know,

272
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,530
his wife got pregnant. His, uh,

273
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,580
he got a job with a defense contractor
and he was like totally on the path and

274
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:46,410
crushing yet despite the fact
that he had, uh, you know,

275
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,850
one of the best excuses
someone could have, hey,

276
00:17:48,851 --> 00:17:51,840
I got wounded and I lost my vision. It
didn't, it didn't slow him down at all.

277
00:17:51,841 --> 00:17:55,780
He climbed Mt. Rainier. He just
did amazing things. And the,

278
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,570
his attitude of, look, I'm
in a bad place. Not that bad.

279
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,630
I'm going to push on. And like
you said, this isn't gonna,

280
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,060
this isn't going to stop me from
having a great life and, and,

281
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,200
and getting after it basically. Yeah. So

282
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,790
couple of things. Uh, I'm glad
you brought that up because it,

283
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:20,060
there's definitely something to my own
recovery during the time where I got

284
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:24,630
there. So it's kind of like, I
almost had a feedback loop on myself,

285
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:28,490
so I got,
I was immediately thinking about,

286
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,260
even in the blast credo is one
of my first thoughts was like,

287
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:35,580
my mom's going to be pretty upset about
this. And when I woke up in Jeremy,

288
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:40,050
the one thing that I did was
I asked for a stupid hat.

289
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,470
I was like, Oh, my squad
leaders there. I said,

290
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,480
see if you can find us a stupid luck and
a hat that I can wear when I come out

291
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:51,420
of the ambulance. So that when my
mom sees me for the first time,

292
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,720
she'll see this stupid hat and maybe it'll
make her laugh a little bit, you know?

293
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,230
Um, but, you know, obviously
they didn't find one.

294
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,130
And,
um,

295
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:07,250
but I think what happened was I had a
good attitude in the first week or two and

296
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:13,800
then that kind of set a precedent for
myself and all my friends that came in,

297
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:18,801
all my family that came in saw me with
that solid positive attitude and that,

298
00:19:19,561 --> 00:19:22,980
you know,
that gave them hope at the same time.

299
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,660
So they had that hope and then I kind of
went on and there was times, you know,

300
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,740
they saw me already like that.
So if there was ever a time where I

301
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,070
was feeling sorry for myself or anything
like that, I was like, you know what,

302
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,360
my mom, my dad, all these people
have already seen me being positive.

303
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,650
And if I flip that around then
that's going to hurt them now.

304
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,880
And so I have to keep that in mind.
So when I'm, it's not really about,

305
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,630
well it's not only about me.
So that forced my,

306
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,190
that's forced me to make sure I maintain
my positive attitude because you know,

307
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,920
they're depending on me,
I'm depending on them at the same time.

308
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,680
So they're depending on me to stay
positive so that they can stay positive.

309
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,720
And so it kind of, we kind of fed
off each other. And so, you know,

310
00:20:09,721 --> 00:20:14,550
that just kind of snowballed I
guess until, you know, here we are.

311
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,740
Now you get so, so you're talking
like a month of milkshakes.

312
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,000
They weren't mint chocolate chip,
but they were good. You know,

313
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,590
and you're just feeding yourself. You're,
you're trying to, trying to heal up,

314
00:20:28,591 --> 00:20:33,060
get the wounds to actually heal. And
you're, every time you go around,

315
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,780
every time you leave your bed, it's a
gut check because you got to, you know,

316
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:37,630
do the,
the,

317
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,880
the wound draining and
all that other stuff.

318
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,960
And then after a month,
things are starting to heal
up. At what point did you,

319
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,720
were you able to like get yourself out,
get yourself in the wheelchair?

320
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,670
I think I was probably after that first.
So I was, I spent a week in the ICU,

321
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,020
uh, you know, high on morphine. I don't
remember much from that, that time period.

322
00:20:59,021 --> 00:21:02,290
And then I get to the ward and
probably after that first week,

323
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,940
maybe 10 days on the main
ward, I'd be like, all right,

324
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:08,440
I'm going to try and do this myself guys.

325
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:11,710
And then it took five times the
length of time, but I did it.

326
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,160
And then from then on I
was doing it on my own.

327
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,820
And so, yeah, that,

328
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:22,590
and that was kind of the
biggest milestone for, you know,

329
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,570
being in the hospital that
during that healing period, uh,

330
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:28,240
was being able to do that. And
then so and then, you know,

331
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,300
as they slowly took tubes away.
Um,

332
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,330
and then the final milestone for being
in the hospital at that point was when my

333
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:41,440
wounds were finally sutured
closed and I got the skin graft,

334
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,040
I'd take a skin graft from my left leg
and put it on the inside of my right

335
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:49,460
thigh. And once they did that and that
was the healed that they checked it out,

336
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,470
made sure it was good, then I was ready
to be transferred over to a Walter Reed,

337
00:21:53,471 --> 00:21:57,970
but I still had stitches, a all in
my or staples, staples or stitches,

338
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:58,804
one of the two.

339
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,990
And so after that was done, that's when
they transferred me over to Walter Reed.

340
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,590
And even then I still had to wait for
those stitches to come out before I could

341
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,520
get fitted for prosthetics.

342
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,690
And I was probably in the inpatient in
the hospital for another two weeks while

343
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:20,590
I waited for a room to open
up in the outpatient housing.

344
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,900
So it was pretty similar in those first
two weeks. I just had the IV line.

345
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,670
That's all I had. And
you know, I could go out,

346
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,070
are they pumping you with antibiotics
the whole time or what do they,

347
00:22:31,071 --> 00:22:33,020
what do they got?
An Ivy and euphoria,

348
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,990
um, pain medication. Um,

349
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,580
and I think it's probably just a stand
at the just in case something goes wrong.

350
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:44,120
They can, they have quick
access. Uh, my buddy Daniel,

351
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:47,690
he had a picc line to like straight
into his heart. What's that? It's just,

352
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,130
I think it's just a, a tube. They just
put it straight, put it into your chest.

353
00:22:52,131 --> 00:22:55,760
And I guess maybe it's just for
quicker access for pain medication.

354
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,590
So I'd be in the hospital that
first month and you know, the,

355
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:04,130
they gave you the pain button so you can
kind of control it yourself and to be

356
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:07,460
funny because they, they, it only
meters out so much in an hour.

357
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,310
You can hit it like once every
five minutes or something.

358
00:23:10,311 --> 00:23:14,090
But in the first week I'd be
kind of passing out and I,

359
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:17,270
whenever I woke up I'd hit it a couple
times just to make sure I get in that

360
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,650
dosage because I was scared. Like, what
happens if this pain button goes away?

361
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:23,390
Like I don't want to face that.

362
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,930
And so they'd come in after an
hour and the nurses say, you know,

363
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:29,420
you can only hit this thing when we
went every five minutes. Like yeah,

364
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:33,620
yeah I know. I said, well you've
hit it like $200 the last hour.

365
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:37,400
Like oh well you know, I just hit
it just, you know, I fall asleep.

366
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,170
Yeah.
And so then during that time when you,

367
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,260
when you were still had like stitches,
but,

368
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,880
and I know we talked
about this a little bit,

369
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:50,690
but you had like the triangle thing
hanging above you or you start doing pull

370
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:54,110
ups and you start trying to do some
kind of upper body workout at that time.

371
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
Yeah, I mean, once I got to Walter Reed,

372
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,130
I met my physical therapist that day and
we set up the time I was going to come

373
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:01,731
in,
uh,

374
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,760
seven o'clock frosh occupational therapy
at eight o'clock for physical there.

375
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,810
And we'd be just doing stuff on the mat
tables so you don't have to be boring

376
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:10,700
legs and you can be
working on other stuff.

377
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,090
While you're waiting for that stuff to
heal. So yeah, I'd be doing kind of dips.

378
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:14,924
I've raised my,

379
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,550
the arms and my wheelchair up really
high and I do dips and you know,

380
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:24,410
they had stuff you could do, like a trunk
strengthening exercises. You know, I,

381
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,410
I wasn't the first double above knee
amputee to come through Walter Reed.

382
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,010
We've been at war for nine years,
so they had this,

383
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,850
all of these exercises already set
up. So I'd come in, I do my exercises,

384
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,940
lay a legless for the day and this work
on what I could while we waited for that

385
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:43,730
stuff to while we waited for my skin and
we're just waiting on my skin basically

386
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:46,280
to heal. How did you feel, like,

387
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,860
how did you feel regaining your strength
and your upper body were, were you, like,

388
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,300
were you like back on the gains path? You
know what I mean? Were you like, okay,

389
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,170
I just did,
you know,

390
00:24:56,171 --> 00:25:00,150
yesterday I did eight pull ups and today
I'm going to do 10 and the next day I'm,

391
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,790
did you get, did you get yourself right
back in like the old school workout mode?

392
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,120
Uh, just back on the path
when I was still in the,

393
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,310
when I was still in the
hospital at Bethesda, uh,

394
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,850
I would go into physical therapy,
but he,

395
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:19,550
you guys got to pull up bar or anything
like that and then yeah, we have one,

396
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,120
they had one in like a closet and
I was, and I saw, I was like, Hey,

397
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,020
I want to do some pull ups.

398
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:27,140
And so I set the pullup record for
people that had come through and it got

399
00:25:27,141 --> 00:25:31,310
broken by a seal later. But uh, so yeah,

400
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:34,520
I set that pull up. It was like,
let me see. I never lost the,

401
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:37,640
the desire to see what I could
do. You know, I was like, yeah,

402
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:40,130
I'm going to do a max set of pull ups
and see how many I could do still.

403
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,070
But yeah, it was definitely
frustrating cause I, I was,

404
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,290
I lost a lot of muscle mass, but you know,
once you started doing those exercises,

405
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:53,291
like every time I came in I wanted to go
at one more or two more or a little bit

406
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:58,250
longer. And I had that same attitude
when I started walking. You know,

407
00:25:58,251 --> 00:25:59,540
the first day I started walking,

408
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,370
I'd maybe stood in my legs for two minutes
and the next day I was like, you know,

409
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:09,020
I'm going to try three minutes today or
last yesterday I walked one time around

410
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:10,790
the little track, I'm going
to go twice, you know,

411
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:13,040
just slowly building up and you know,

412
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,490
same. So what's that process like getting,
getting standing up for the first time?

413
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,660
What does that feel like?

414
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:24,410
It's wild. I mean, the first
thing you gotta do is you've
got to get cast it. It's,

415
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,210
they have to make the sockets
that go onto your, uh, stumps.

416
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,673
And they do it,

417
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,180
they make they a wrap this
plaster around your stump and they

418
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,490
mold it so that it's putting pressure on
the right spots. And they take that off,

419
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:44,400
they fill it up with some
other kind of plaster material.

420
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,140
Uh,
they take the,

421
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,170
the cast they made off and then
they pour plastic around that.

422
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:53,910
And so then you have,

423
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:58,000
you're basically a mold of your
leg and the first time you,

424
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,860
the first time you step up in it is not
comfortable at all or it hurts a lot

425
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,990
because you're putting pressure on points
that you didn't before and they kind

426
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:09,390
of have to see you stand
up and you're like, okay,

427
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:12,450
well there's a spot right
back there that hurts a lot.

428
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,020
So they take it off and they use this
hairdryer and make it hot and they kind of

429
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,800
mold that. They push it out against
so it's not against that spot anymore.

430
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,380
And then you put it back on,
okay, that's comfortable.

431
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,300
And then you do it for the other one.
And for me, yeah. I mean I could,

432
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,820
you could,
you can't,

433
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,700
I couldn't just walk from the first try.
I had to have my arms on the,

434
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,760
on the uh, the parallel bars
and like it was, you know,

435
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,520
that slow thing that you see kind of in,

436
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:46,380
in movies where I took them maybe
10 steps and that was it for me.

437
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:47,080
First Time

438
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,080
I've walked five balance or is
it a little bit musculature?

439
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,310
Like is it you're using different muscles?

440
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,900
Yeah.
So you definitely,

441
00:27:55,901 --> 00:28:00,340
you're walking in a different
way then your body's designed to,

442
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,640
so when you walk you just go,
you know,

443
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,530
kind of forward and back
here with your legs.

444
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:09,550
You're Ben Bend at the knee to get it
past the ground so it doesn't skip on the

445
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:14,170
ground. Whereas when you're
double above knee amputee, uh,

446
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,710
you have to swing your legs out to the
side at first cause you don't have that

447
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:20,830
knee joint.
You can't just bring them forward.

448
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,220
So you kind of have to learn that
and it's a lot of the balance your,

449
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,550
your musculature has to kind of get used
to what muscles you're using to keep

450
00:28:30,551 --> 00:28:32,180
your balance now.
Uh,

451
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,130
so that has to be figured out by
your brain and your spinal cord.

452
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,950
And then on top of that,

453
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:42,940
just developing the resistance to the,

454
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,030
the discomfort does,
it's really not comfortable.

455
00:28:46,031 --> 00:28:48,190
And that's kind of probably
what I didn't get tired.

456
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,750
Like I could have stood for longer,
but it's just my legs were hurting so bad.

457
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,980
Yeah. Like you could run a mile or
you could run a marathon or whatever,

458
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,540
but if you're, if you're, if you have
a blister on your tail, you know,

459
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,890
then that's going to stop you.

460
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,620
It seems like the balance thing,

461
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,070
like sometimes I've heard my like
let's say hurt my ankle or hurt my,

462
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,830
even something as stupid as hurt,
like had a big cut on my,

463
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,730
on the bottom of my foot.
Yeah.

464
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,040
And so you can't use your foot the way
you normally do and it totally throws off

465
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,960
your balance.
And I can't even imagine you're,

466
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,540
you're now trying to balance through the,

467
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,140
through the perception of your
nerves in your, in your stumps and,

468
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,770
and how that feels and how you
got to kind of adjust for that.

469
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:37,940
That's gotta be like learning
how to ski or something,

470
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:42,160
learning how to do a balanced type
sport, surf, something like that. I can,

471
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,250
I can only imagine that that's gotta
be what it's like to get your brain and

472
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:45,671
like you said,

473
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:49,120
your brain and your spinal cord to
be able to adapt to what's happening

474
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,150
underneath you when you have a totally
new set of sensors down there now.

475
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,990
Yeah.
And you'd have to also keep,

476
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,200
have to keep it for a double above knee
amputee and all this stuff I'm saying is

477
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:02,240
this double above knee amputees.
But uh,

478
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,920
you're also losing two joints
that help with balance.

479
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:09,880
So enabled body person, they have, if
they want to make a small adjustment,

480
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:13,360
they use their ankle and then they can
use the knee and then they can use the

481
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:16,240
hip. But you know, double above
knee, we, all we have is the hip.

482
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,780
So it's an extra challenge learning how
to make these adjustments with just,

483
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,940
just your hips. But you know,
it's kind of, it's a lot like a,

484
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,450
a dog that has a missing leg.
You know,

485
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,830
the first time he goes to walk he kinda
just figures it out and he is learns

486
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,340
that new method and it's kind of, it's
pretty much a similar thing. You know,

487
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,330
you adapt to it and you just,
you figure it out

488
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,490
ain't on the first
prosthetics that you get.

489
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:44,491
Are they articulated or they just like
straight cause I know what you've got

490
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:47,890
now. It was pretty, they look
pretty damn advanced to me.

491
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,510
I mean you can get you looking like a
freaking term terminator robot over there.

492
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,560
Are you getting that first?
Cause it's an articulating because,

493
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:58,320
oh um,
so yeah,

494
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,490
it's in the balance in that realm.

495
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,520
They keep you really short while you're
relearning that balance because just in

496
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:11,900
case you fall. So while you're relearning
that balance and keep you really short.

497
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,090
So basically I could,
if I was going to fall,

498
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:17,060
I just put my hand out pretty much
and catch myself on the ground.

499
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:21,350
And so while you'll read
learning this balance,

500
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:24,890
they keep you nice and short
because your center of gravity,

501
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,690
it's going to be lower.
So it's a lot easier.

502
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,590
And then also you kind
of learn that hip motion,

503
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,110
so they keep you nice and short
just to make it a lot easier.

504
00:31:33,111 --> 00:31:34,940
And then as you get better,

505
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,420
as you get stronger and a
little bit better moving around,

506
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:42,530
they make you a little bit taller. But
there's no knee joint. It's just a,

507
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,590
you go from your socket and there's a
Bates straight cylindrical pylon made out

508
00:31:48,921 --> 00:31:52,370
of metal and that goes to the prosthetic
foot and you probably have a shoe on

509
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:56,890
the foot and then that's it. So
you, you stay really short, uh,

510
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,640
for three,
four months.

511
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,710
And at this time are you already thinking
about like what kind of crazy stuff

512
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,670
you're going to do once
you figure this shit out?

513
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,260
I, once I had found out
about the Paralympics, uh,

514
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,260
that was probably my first week when
I was at Bethesda in the hospital bed,

515
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,820
just researching.

516
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,110
I wanted to get back in the gym
and I didn't know what I could,

517
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,840
what I'd still be able to do in the gym.
So I was maybe looking for,

518
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,671
I forget what I searched,

519
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:26,850
but like disabled sports or disabled
working out or something like that.

520
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:31,080
And I found the pair Olympics and at
the time I wasn't saying to myself,

521
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,380
I'm definitely going to commit to going
because they didn't know much about it

522
00:32:34,381 --> 00:32:37,260
and I still had this big, I
still had to take, you know,

523
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:42,230
a year and a half to relearn how to
walking. And that was numero uno, uh,

524
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:45,230
to learn how to do. But yeah, it
was kind of in the back of my head,

525
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,850
I had found about it and
I was thinking about it.

526
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,640
That's kind of how things work for me.
I can,

527
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,290
the idea is impregnated
initially and like I, okay,

528
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,010
that's an interesting idea. You know,
Paralympics. Okay, that's interesting.

529
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,500
I go ride my bike, cross
country. Okay, interesting.

530
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,930
And then I think about it a little
bit more and time goes on. I think.

531
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,630
Yeah, I could probably do that, you know?

532
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:11,120
And then eventually I'll get to
a point where like, all right,

533
00:33:11,121 --> 00:33:14,870
I'm going to do it and then I commit
to it. And so at this point, you know,

534
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:18,770
I hadn't committed to it,
but I was researching and you know,

535
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,420
contemplating and figuring
out the feasibility and you
know how I would go about

536
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:25,940
it if I wanted to try
and make the attempt.

537
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:31,070
That seems like that would have a
massive positive impact on your mindset.

538
00:33:31,921 --> 00:33:35,520
So something that I talk about and I
talked about with Jordan Peterson and he

539
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,610
agreed with me on this idea of finding
a new mission and having a new mission.

540
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:43,380
So a lot of times,
I'm sure you've seen this too,

541
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:47,310
I've definitely seen it when guys get
out of the military for whatever reason,

542
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,683
when they get out,

543
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,090
the guys that do well are the guys that
have a new mission to go on and on,

544
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,860
whether it's a new job or whether they're
going to be a super dad or whether

545
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:59,640
they're going to go to school and
get good grades. Those guys do good.

546
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,680
And in their new mission,

547
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,210
the guys that have the most trouble from
what I've seen most of the time is the

548
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:09,570
guys that don't have a, a new mission
there. They get out and they say, well,

549
00:34:09,571 --> 00:34:12,360
you know, I might do this, I might
do that, I might do something else.

550
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:15,630
But what they're really doing is nothing.
They don't have any real direction.

551
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:20,460
And they end up, you know, what's
the mission? The mission becomes,

552
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:24,240
have another drink, you know,
uh, do something unproductive,

553
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:26,970
do what feels good immediately.
And it's becomes problematic.

554
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,680
But it seems like the fact that
you found something immediately,

555
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,110
you realize that there was a
goal that you could go after,

556
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:38,940
even if it was only a little idea at
first. That idea can carry you a long way.

557
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,880
Yeah. And you know, also, luckily
for me it wasn't like, it was,

558
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,220
it's not like I was in Afghanistan one
day and then separated the next day.

559
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:50,680
I kind of had a mission that was,
you know,

560
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,280
it came about, uh, about by its own
because, you know, I just lost my legs.

561
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,620
My first mission was learn how to walk.
So I had that right away. But you know,

562
00:34:59,621 --> 00:35:03,970
while I was taking that time to do
that, I was thinking about, you know,

563
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,400
what I'm going to do after?
I get out and you know every,

564
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,470
every guy that gets out of the military,

565
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:12,250
you know most of the time you know when
your contract's going to end so you can

566
00:35:12,251 --> 00:35:15,790
start thinking about it earlier. But
it's definitely no, I agree with you.

567
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:20,791
Having having something to work
towards is a hugely important,

568
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,510
I'll, I'll tell you that
even what you just said.

569
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,630
So there's people that they
get out and you're saying,

570
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,040
hey, I had this new mission cause I had
to at least learn how to walk. There's,

571
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,680
there's people that they get out and
they don't have a new mission and they

572
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:39,150
don't figure one out and that becomes
problematic. And I, and you know what,

573
00:35:39,151 --> 00:35:41,220
let's not just apply it to the military.

574
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:45,050
I'll apply this to every human being
happy kids get out of college happens when

575
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,640
kids get out of high school happens
when you go through, you know,

576
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:50,100
you've got something that you're looking
at or something that you're focused on

577
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,830
and boom, it goes away. Well
now what are you going to do?

578
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:55,860
And if you don't line something
up and don't focus on something,

579
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,470
you don't take aim at something,
well then you're not going anywhere.

580
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,920
Oh yeah. It's like when
you're, you know how you shoot,

581
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:06,190
do you guys call it table to when you're
kind of working on a shooting like

582
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,420
targets that are right in front of you.
We don't call it terrible too.

583
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,600
We call it table two is table one is
kind of the long distance drive range.

584
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,440
But it's almost kind of like when you're,
when you're doing that and you,

585
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,570
they say, okay shoot this
guy twice and that guy twice.

586
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:24,230
So you do that and then at the end you
scan and make sure there's nobody else

587
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:26,450
around. So it's kind of like doing that.
Your mission is to shoot the thing,

588
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:28,430
but you also have to be looking
out for other stuff. Yeah,

589
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,420
yeah. No, absolutely. You know it's,

590
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:34,680
it's funny too cause I think about like
when you think about kids that you grew

591
00:36:34,681 --> 00:36:38,490
up with and like high school,

592
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,980
they get done with high school and
there's some kids that, Oh God,

593
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm going to go into college. I'm
going to go to military. Yeah.

594
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,490
There's some kids that don't know what
they're going to do after high school and

595
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:52,350
what happens to him. You know, what
happens to them? They, they, they,

596
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:55,920
they flounder around. They get a little
job here that they don't really like,

597
00:36:55,921 --> 00:36:57,270
they do something else.
They don't really like,

598
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,630
you just have to be careful of that.
You have to be careful.

599
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:03,720
And I'd say as a parent, that's something
to look out for it too. You know,

600
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:07,860
you gotta look out for your kids and make
sure your kids have something to focus

601
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,800
on.
Have something that they're striving for.

602
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,020
Because if you don't have
anything to strive for,

603
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,740
if you're not trying to go anywhere,
if you're not on some kind of mission,

604
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,630
that that's problematic.

605
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,220
Yeah. And you know, so since I had that,

606
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,190
everything I did during the day,

607
00:37:24,191 --> 00:37:29,191
it mattered to me because I had something
that was vastly important to me that I

608
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,330
was trying to achieve.

609
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:35,140
So if I didn't care about
whether or not I walked again,

610
00:37:35,141 --> 00:37:37,480
then I could just roll
around in my wheelchair.

611
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,720
And it wouldn't matter if I worked
out that day. But since I really,

612
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:45,721
I learned how to walk again and be
totally independent and get rid of my

613
00:37:45,941 --> 00:37:49,570
wheelchair and all that stuff to be able
to run and do everything I was able to

614
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:52,930
do before that was, you know,
the most important thing.

615
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,250
And so I fed off that when,
you know,

616
00:37:57,251 --> 00:38:00,880
I didn't feel like going into therapy
because I was my back hurt or whatever.

617
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,380
And the, you know, whether
or not I do that third,

618
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:10,030
fourth set of balanced drills or you know,

619
00:38:10,031 --> 00:38:14,560
a strengthening exercises, you
know, that had an effect on,

620
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:19,420
on that goal. And, and so, and the same
thing with going to the Paralympics.

621
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:22,810
You know, I wanted to be
able to, to explore that.

622
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:26,380
And so the stuff I was doing
in the hospital, it mattered.

623
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,390
So this is interesting because,
uh,

624
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,080
we were actually talking about this
the other day. So you end up with,

625
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,220
and I guess again, I'm just
trying to break down. Obviously

626
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,053
you're a person that,

627
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:42,420
that can push through pain and
suffering and push through short term,

628
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,810
uh, challenges in order to
achieve a longterm goal.

629
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,560
And I think that the way you
break it down is you're looking,

630
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:59,740
even when you're, you're suffering from
a challenge right now, you're, you're,

631
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,071
you know,

632
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,740
I don't feel like doing another balance
to drill because my back is sore or

633
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:06,070
whatever. Yeah. Well people hit that,
those kinds of obstacles every single day,

634
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,140
you know, they don't want to get up in
the morning, they don't want to work out,

635
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:12,340
they don't want to do the last set, et
Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. But you had,

636
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,240
you tie those small term,
short term things,

637
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,730
the short term pain because you have a
longterm goal that you really care about.

638
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,610
Yeah, exactly. I mean it's, it's all a
matter of what matters to you most, uh,

639
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,940
you know, is what's more important
to you learning for or for me,

640
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:35,440
learning how to walk again
or staying in bed today.

641
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,150
You know, staying in bed would be nice.
It would feel good. I'd be able to watch.

642
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,370
I think what I was watching on Netflix,

643
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:45,220
I was watching 24 of
the series on Netflix.

644
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:50,110
I can watch an entire series of 24 today
or something and I could do that and

645
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:53,740
that would be fun. But
at the end of the day,

646
00:39:53,741 --> 00:39:55,820
I'm still not gonna be any closer
to being able to walk again.

647
00:39:55,821 --> 00:40:00,100
And I would much rather be
able to walk everywhere.

648
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:04,660
I went totally independently then
find out what happens to Jack Bauer,

649
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,770
you know, so, and then, you know,
at the same time, you know, if,

650
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,240
if you're working on,
you know what people like to leave it.

651
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:16,330
If you want to lose weight and you know,
do you,

652
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:21,331
would you rather have a milkshake mint
chocolate chip milkshake or would you

653
00:40:21,431 --> 00:40:24,820
rather it cook cookie dough milkshake?

654
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,190
Would you rather have that milkshake
or would you rather, you know,

655
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:35,191
be able to run 10 miles or not get winded
when you're walking with your kids or

656
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:38,620
in a playing with your kids. It's like
what, which one matters to you more?

657
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,080
And I always pick that bigger
one because I mean it's,

658
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:43,510
it's pretty straightforward for me.

659
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:49,870
The delayed gratification is the
delayed gratification versus the instant

660
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:54,860
gratification delayed but much more
enjoyable. Yeah, much more durable.

661
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,760
Definitely better and
better for your whole life.

662
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,130
Last longer too by the way. Yeah.
Yup. And enduring. It's an enduring,

663
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:07,310
lasting, longer lasting, enduring
thing that you end up with.

664
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,200
[inaudible] that's what people
need to tap into. That right there.

665
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,200
That's good. How you have a
like a way, like almost like a,

666
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,530
I don't want to say scaffolding, but
like a way to look at it. Like how you,

667
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:22,130
when you're presented with like an option,
you're, hey, you're conscious of it. B,

668
00:41:22,131 --> 00:41:23,930
you have a way to look at
it where you're like, okay,

669
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:26,600
which one is important to
me? Which one, you know,

670
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:31,730
is Jack Bauer in 24 important to me?
Whereas walking important to me, you know,

671
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:34,040
so most people,
they just on how they feel,

672
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,491
you know,

673
00:41:34,491 --> 00:41:38,960
I really don't feel like doing this so
I'll do this or I really am in the mood

674
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,590
for this, so I'll do it kind of thing.
They don't like kind of in a way,

675
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:44,370
break it down like how you do just,
yeah,

676
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,030
just from moment to moment
where you'll be like, okay,

677
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:50,000
I have this way to look at it and I'm
gonna look at it this way and then I can

678
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:52,800
re or, or behave, you
know that it actually is,

679
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,070
that's pretty a good way of looking at it.

680
00:41:55,071 --> 00:42:00,050
You put it into a binary calculation,
right?

681
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,460
There's two options. Don't go like, am I
going to do the thing that's gonna make,

682
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,030
make me better in the long run or the
thing that's gonna make me worse in the

683
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:11,560
long run and feels good right now.
Which one are you going to do this?

684
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,160
You just make that into a binary
decision. Yeah, but he didn't his release.

685
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,270
So simple.
Which one's important to me and it's,

686
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,680
it's almost like a black or white.

687
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,090
No. Which ones? What's
driving your behavior?

688
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,770
And then you can even take
it another step. Like, again,

689
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:31,710
like the losing the weight example,
you,

690
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,790
you will either want to have the milkshake
or you want to be able to, you know,

691
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,850
walk around with the guys. Even
if you don't care about, you know,

692
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:44,851
being overweight or you're not
being able to move your body around,

693
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:49,630
you know, you can still lose
the weight by figuring out what,

694
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,700
even if you don't feel
like going on a diet,

695
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:55,810
like what is it that necessitates
you to go on the Diet. And for me,

696
00:42:55,811 --> 00:43:00,811
so I didn't want necessarily to
train every day for the Paralympics.

697
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:04,250
I didn't necessarily want to ride my bike
every day on my bike ride or run them.

698
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,630
I didn't necessarily enjoy doing that.
I didn't feel like doing it,

699
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:13,320
but I had to do that because my
goal necessitated me to do that.

700
00:43:13,361 --> 00:43:16,240
So if you're struggling to
get motivated to lose weight,

701
00:43:16,241 --> 00:43:17,590
just for the sake of losing weight,

702
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,150
find something that necessitates you to
lose weight, that really matters to you.

703
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:25,120
Like, you know, not dying when
you're 55 of a heart attack,

704
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,540
that'll do it. Um, there's,

705
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,760
there's three things that you
talked about on the law. Well,

706
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,900
we talked about it on the last podcast,
but I kind of breathed it,

707
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,510
breezed over them. And I, and I
realized when I listened to it again,

708
00:43:37,511 --> 00:43:40,690
I should've talked to you a little
bit more in depth because I think it's

709
00:43:40,691 --> 00:43:45,580
helpful for people to hear again to
hear from you who's overcome incredible

710
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:48,580
challenges. There's three things
that you talked about. Um,

711
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,010
and it's actually in the journal, which
you, which you have a journal Online, um,

712
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:57,040
on, on Rob Jones, journey.com. But, and
this is there as well, but number one,

713
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,300
number one is writing down goals.

714
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:01,300
Number two is celebrating milestones
and number three is overcoming

715
00:44:01,301 --> 00:44:06,100
rationalization. So let's just
break those down a little bit.

716
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,570
How strict were you with
writing down your goals?

717
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:12,670
And do you still do that?

718
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,350
Um, I don't, I guess I don't physically,

719
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,120
you'll have a pen and
paper and write it down.

720
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:25,130
I think what I do now is I'll announce
it or something like that, or I'll,

721
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,670
I'll make it known that that's
what I'm planning on doing check.

722
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,130
So when I decided to do
my marathon challenge,

723
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,350
I did it on Facebook or something,

724
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:39,180
or I'd put it on all my social media
platforms and then it's out there now.

725
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:42,340
Okay, now I'm responsible. This
is beyond writing it down. Yeah.

726
00:44:42,341 --> 00:44:46,530
This is like writing it down or selling
it to the world or telling people that

727
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,120
you want to have the respect
of like if I told my wife Pam,

728
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:54,510
like I, I'm going to do this. And she,

729
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:55,580
okay,

730
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:59,720
she knows I'm a person that she respects
me for living up to what I say I'm

731
00:44:59,721 --> 00:45:04,370
going to do. I don't want to lose
her respect. So now, um, even,

732
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,440
even though I would
have done it regardless,

733
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,420
I'm not saying I would've
said I wouldn't do it.

734
00:45:08,421 --> 00:45:12,110
And then that fallout or
back out I another mission,

735
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:14,630
even if the mission became not
important to me, there was another,

736
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:18,570
another aspect of that. And you know,
you, you've committed to it at that.

737
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:23,580
So that's another aspect of my personality
where not only do I want to help

738
00:45:24,081 --> 00:45:26,720
veterans, but now I've committed
to some, I said I'm going to do,

739
00:45:26,721 --> 00:45:30,860
and I've given my word and now there's
people that are kind of relying on me to,

740
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,680
to do that. And if I, if I say I'm
going to do it, then I say, oh,

741
00:45:33,681 --> 00:45:34,700
we could never mind.
I actually,

742
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:40,010
I'm not going to do it then they're
actually losing a little bit of hope.

743
00:45:40,011 --> 00:45:42,180
Maybe. Cause they were, they were
hoping I was going to do it and they,

744
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:46,670
we're going to get something out of
it now, now that I'm not doing it.

745
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:49,370
So they're kind of losing
that, that benefit. Yeah.

746
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,770
Makes Sense. Yeah. So it's
beyond writing it down.

747
00:45:51,771 --> 00:45:55,220
It's writing it down or announcing,
announcing it. Celebrating milestones.

748
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:56,820
Yeah.

749
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,820
So it's really hard to stay motivated
when there's this obscure goal that is two

750
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:13,431
years away or a year and a half
away and you're not really seeing

751
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,060
huge progress towards everybody. You
getting like a millimeter every day. Um,

752
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,940
it gets old, you know, you feel really
motivated in the beginning, right.

753
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:27,520
Cause you're pumped up and you have
tons of energy and then when you,

754
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,880
and at the end you can see it,
you can smell the barn and you can see it.

755
00:46:30,881 --> 00:46:35,440
So you find the extra energy in
your, in yourself. But in that,

756
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:36,990
that middle part where you're not,

757
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:41,380
you're not even sure that you're going
to be able to do it and it's so far away

758
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,590
and you're like, man, I'm, I'm
only like halfway and I still have,

759
00:46:44,591 --> 00:46:49,270
I've done all this stuff and now I
still have to do all that again. Um,

760
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:50,420
it helps too.

761
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,690
Okay.

762
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:57,280
Pick stuff along the way that,
you know, is going to, uh,
to be there. That kind of,

763
00:46:57,281 --> 00:47:00,940
you know, all right. I'm not, I'm
going for that far away thing,

764
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:04,630
but right now I'm going to that.
And that's what excites me.

765
00:47:04,631 --> 00:47:06,820
So when I was in the hospital,

766
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,600
getting in the wheelchair was
my first little milestone, the,

767
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:13,180
I had a year and I didn't even know how
long it was going to take me to learn

768
00:47:13,181 --> 00:47:16,150
how to walk again. Right. At least I
was thinking like a year and a half,

769
00:47:16,151 --> 00:47:20,500
two years. Yeah, that's a long time
and with a lot of work in between.

770
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:21,760
So all right,

771
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,780
right now does get into the
wheelchair and then all right,

772
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:30,810
well learn how to do it on your own and
then after that get your legs and then

773
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,660
figure out how to walk with only one
cane instead of two canes keeping you up

774
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,990
and then drop the other cane
and that's another milestone.

775
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:45,580
And then you get your bionic knees and
so you probably go back to the canes for

776
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:48,550
Awhile and then when you have those you
take away that cane and then take away

777
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:49,001
the other one.

778
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:53,440
And then you learn how to run and then
you learn how to do ride the bike or

779
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:56,830
whatever. So you just keep finding
little things along the way.

780
00:47:56,831 --> 00:47:59,470
And you know when I was doing,
when I was training for triathlons,

781
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:00,910
I do this on a small scale.

782
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:06,450
I would have ate two minute
all out sprints on my bike
to do and I'd be sitting

783
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:10,190
there on the first one and I'm like,
oh my God, I have eight of these to do.

784
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,260
The first one would just blow me up.
I'm like, Oh my God, I have seven more.

785
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:18,370
And I would just be like, you know
what, just focus on this next one.

786
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,080
Just do this one and then we'll focus
on the next one after that. And then,

787
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:26,980
so just, I would even trick myself
sometimes I'd be like, all right,

788
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,410
I'd be at my sixth one, I'd
be so tired. And the arc,

789
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:34,411
you know what if I can maintain this speed
or if I can make my power maintain my

790
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:37,090
power output for this entire seventh one,

791
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:40,690
I'll skip the eighth one is I'll treat
myself, I'll skip the eighth one.

792
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,950
I do the seventh one,
I'd be like, all right,

793
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:44,370
I'll just do the eighth
one cause you know, I,

794
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,560
I do that something to treat
myself, you know? So, yeah.

795
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:50,430
So it's interesting. So what, you've
talked with his back on me in these,

796
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,240
in this thing, and I've talked about
this before. I've talked about before,

797
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:56,980
multiple times. Uh, I don't even
know if I've talked to from the Pie,

798
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,500
I must have talked about in the podcast,
but I've taught,

799
00:48:58,501 --> 00:48:59,940
I talk about it with people,

800
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:04,890
which is you have long range stuff and
you have short range stuff and what you

801
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:08,400
have to do is you have to put the both
pose in your mind and you have to shift

802
00:49:08,401 --> 00:49:09,510
the focus back on forth,

803
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,890
back and forth between the two to
whichever one is going to get you moving.

804
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,310
Because when the goal is too
far away, you're like, ah,

805
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:19,740
you know what is not going to really
make a difference if I skip this thing

806
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:24,420
today, it's not that big of a deal. The
goal is too far away. It gets blurry and,

807
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,300
and so what you need is you need to put,
okay, just the obs do the short call.

808
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:30,690
Well, after the daily grind
beats you down on the short goal,

809
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,130
you start to forget what the longterm goal
is and you guy, you know what? I don't,

810
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,150
I don't really need to do this
workout today or I don't need to do,

811
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,360
I can eat this food or I can do whatever
because it's not going to make a big

812
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:42,000
impact on the long thing. You
know, w what am I doing anyways?

813
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,670
Then you've got to look back at the
long goal and that's right. I have this,

814
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:48,300
this thing that I'm trying to make happen
and it's these small goals that are

815
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:51,120
going to get me there.
So you got to shift.

816
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,440
You got to have both the longterm goal
that's gotta be something that you really

817
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:59,460
want to achieve. You've got to
understand why, you know, like you said,

818
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:01,770
you got to understand why it
is you want to achieve it.

819
00:50:01,771 --> 00:50:04,890
You can't just be something that you
don't care about and then you got to have

820
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:08,280
that as your primary driving force.
But your secondary driving force,

821
00:50:08,281 --> 00:50:11,490
which is equally important, is these
short term things that you can get to,

822
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:16,500
that are there, that are close, that are
you can achieve even if it's two minutes.

823
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,820
Even if it's, I did Tabata a Tabata
on the air bike the other day,

824
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:26,340
bro. Yeah, I was there.
I was like, you know,

825
00:50:26,341 --> 00:50:28,380
and my daughter was there.
My wrestled,

826
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:29,390
my daughter that Russell's,

827
00:50:29,391 --> 00:50:32,140
she was there and so she's kind
of like calling me out but,

828
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,450
but in a positive way. She's
like a positive person. Yeah.

829
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:39,590
She was hyping me and I put out hard
cause she was there going, come on.

830
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,020
You know what it's like when your,
your daughter's going to come on,

831
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:45,630
dad pushed harder. You're like, oh
awesome. Yeah I'm going to get some,

832
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,670
I want him to die. You know, you know
the blood tastes in your mouth, you know?

833
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,850
Yeah. Whatever that thing is. So I had
some of that going on but, but yeah,

834
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:58,240
you have the short term and
you have a longterm goals.

835
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:01,940
You got to have them both and you gotta
they've gotta be attached somehow.

836
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:06,980
But you've got to lean on which one is
going to get you to do what you know

837
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:10,280
you're supposed to do.
You know you're supposed to do,

838
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:14,840
that's a little psychology behind
just getting after it. Right.

839
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,110
This is a little psychology behind just
getting after it. A little head games.

840
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:20,930
You Echo and I were talking
the other day and he was all,

841
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,010
he was kind of surprised because I was
talking about there's a one workout that

842
00:51:25,011 --> 00:51:27,380
I do, which is PR. It's I,

843
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,550
it's my hardest and most
brutal workout and it's in,

844
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:36,500
it's in the field manual,
but it's a 20 rep squat.

845
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:37,851
You Do,
you do,

846
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:42,230
you take a weight that you can squat
10 times and you do it 20 times.

847
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:48,320
And like after rep 12
every single rep is just,

848
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,020
it just, it's, it's pain.

849
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:56,000
And then you do that and then you lay
on the floor for 20 minutes and then you

850
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:58,700
get up and you do it again and you lay
on the floor for 20 minutes and you'd get

851
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:01,700
up and do it again. So it's three
sets in one hour to one hour workout.

852
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,310
But I was telling an
echo, I was like, yeah,

853
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:09,311
there's times where I'm in the middle of
like set two and I'm on rep 14 and I'm

854
00:52:09,951 --> 00:52:12,800
like, I don't even, I don't
even think I want to be strong.

855
00:52:12,801 --> 00:52:16,130
I don't want to be strong.
I don't, I don't even care
from healthy. I just want to,

856
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,590
I just want to just this,
this, this is horrible.

857
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:21,580
Why would I be doing this right
now? This is stupid. Yeah. Relief.

858
00:52:21,581 --> 00:52:22,640
Any kind of weave.
But,

859
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:27,670
but actually what gets me to push
through those is I think to myself,

860
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:33,620
Oh, you hear that? That's actual
weakness in your mind right now.

861
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:37,400
Actual living weakness gets a
voice in your mind right now.

862
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:40,490
Are you going to listen to it?
Are you gonna listen to it? No.

863
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,370
You're not going to listen to it. Are
you doing, I'm a straight through or you,

864
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,620
yes,
that's it's,

865
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,710
it's an old school workout that
I originally got from, well,

866
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:50,270
there's a book called super squats.

867
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,750
There's a book called super squats if,
and that book has this workup,

868
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,410
but the, actually that book
only has you do one set.

869
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,060
You do one set. I was the idiot
that sought to myself. Well,

870
00:53:05,061 --> 00:53:09,950
if one set is good, how about I do
three sets of that and it's brutal.

871
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,630
It's brutal. Yeah. It's like, well,
I have to do it now. Yeah, no,

872
00:53:14,631 --> 00:53:17,260
that's another thing. That's
another thing I say is, is you know,

873
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:19,520
if you don't really feel like
working out, okay, that's fine.

874
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:21,380
Write down what you're going
to do and then just do it.

875
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,010
Just turn off your brain and just
do what you're supposed to do.

876
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:26,070
Just put the numbers down

877
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,990
and do what you're supposed to do.
You're not, every day is all happy,

878
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:35,370
you know? This is great. I'm
feeling myself getting stronger. No,

879
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:40,050
I feel like I'm gonna Puke. That's not
cool, but that's good. That's like,

880
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:44,970
like kind of like you're talking about
how if you go by how you feel every day.

881
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,880
Like I feel like doing this
or I'm feeling motivated,

882
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,410
feeling where it's just like
you're saying rob, where are you?

883
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,850
You are in the habit of
looking at it a certain way.

884
00:53:53,851 --> 00:53:57,120
Like what's important to me, how you
feel. It's kind of shuffled to the side.

885
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,340
It's like what's important. Okay,
now I'm going to get moving. Yeah.

886
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:02,880
Feelings are not,

887
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,660
not generally not a good thing to rely
on to make things generally not a good,

888
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,780
they can trick you though.
You know how like, just like,

889
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:13,860
how are you saying in the beginning,

890
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:18,540
you know when you first decided to do
something you don't like New Year's

891
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,981
resolution? What are, you know,

892
00:54:18,981 --> 00:54:21,510
like it's real common thing
where at the BNA exciting,

893
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,740
let's start this new thing
and then at the end it can be,

894
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:28,080
because you see the goal right there,
we're about to do it, you know,

895
00:54:28,081 --> 00:54:31,980
kind of thing. But in the middle
it's like, yeah, so feeling can,

896
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:35,400
I don't want to say, yeah, you're,
you're right. Don't rely on it,

897
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,130
but it can trick you because in the
beginning when you have that feeling like

898
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:38,911
you want to,
it's like,

899
00:54:38,911 --> 00:54:40,830
it's almost like you think it's
going to be there the whole time.

900
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:44,180
That's a new thing. This is
the new thing from me. I'm,

901
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,100
I've never felt like this
about anything I've ever done.

902
00:54:47,101 --> 00:54:49,410
I'm excited about this one. Then it
goes away and then you're like, oh,

903
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,833
we're not doing that.

904
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,860
Always had that energy at the
end, like of a, I bet like the,

905
00:54:53,861 --> 00:54:57,370
the last one of that to
Bata that you did was like,

906
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,250
well where was all that energy?

907
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:07,770
Have you guys ever heard of the central
governor theory of fatigue? Well,

908
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:10,120
it's basically about two different,

909
00:55:10,121 --> 00:55:14,680
so see if I can do this without making
it super long. There's two different,

910
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:16,810
we got eight hours of recording time.

911
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,740
There's two different 18
theories on how your body,

912
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,560
I guess processes fatigue or what it
exactly it is. And so there's the,

913
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,910
I think it's called the catastrophic
theory where basically your journey,

914
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:34,950
you tabatas and something
breaks down and then like, uh,

915
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,800
you run out of energy totally deplete
yourself of glycogen or whatever.

916
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:42,760
And then you, you can't because
you don't have any more glycogen,

917
00:55:42,761 --> 00:55:46,900
so you muscles just don't work.
And then there's this other theory,

918
00:55:46,901 --> 00:55:51,901
which is kind of the accepted theory
now that your brain has a governor in it

919
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:54,250
and it's,

920
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:59,140
it's getting all this information
from your muscles and your senses.

921
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:00,540
It's getting all this information.

922
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,670
It's calculating how much
energy it meters out.

923
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,790
And so when you're doing your Tabatas,
the first one,

924
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:07,750
you have all sorts of energy.

925
00:56:07,751 --> 00:56:11,140
So your brain is like go and it's
connected to your subconscious and your

926
00:56:11,141 --> 00:56:14,680
constant kind of connect because you kind
of know how many sets you do and your

927
00:56:14,681 --> 00:56:17,450
brain actually calculate that.
Calculate to that end too.

928
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:21,310
It's how it decides to do this.
So that first one you're like, oh,

929
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:25,330
if tons of glycogen available me so I
can just blow through this first one.

930
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:30,670
And then as you go, uh, your,

931
00:56:30,671 --> 00:56:33,970
your, your brain's getting the
signals that you're running,

932
00:56:33,971 --> 00:56:35,230
you run out of glycogen,

933
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,790
maybe the calcium to contract the
muscles is kind of getting low.

934
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:43,210
And so it kind of dials you back,
uh,

935
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:47,320
automatically by contracting less
muscle fibers. And so you kind of get,

936
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:49,210
and it makes you feel fatigued.

937
00:56:49,211 --> 00:56:53,660
So they say that fatigue is actually a
fatigue and pain are actually emotion.

938
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,940
So it makes you feel these emotions,

939
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,330
fatigue,
fatigue.

940
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:02,330
So it makes you feel this and
it kind of dials you back.

941
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:07,190
And then on that last one, you know that
this is your last one. So it's like,

942
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:10,580
all right, well we're done after this,
so I'm going to let it go. And then

943
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:13,370
is the theory,
so it's kind of that kind of book.

944
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:16,130
So there is this thing called the gold.
I think I told you this,

945
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:19,800
a Gold Ji 10 I think I'm pronouncing
it correctly. Golgi tendon organs,

946
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,340
a little regulator, and
they're essentially like
clusters of nerves that going.

947
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,440
And so this is more like high intensity.
Like I'm gonna do a two rep,

948
00:57:28,441 --> 00:57:30,960
one rep to rep through your rep,
whatever Max.

949
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:34,170
So that's regulated by your brain.

950
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:36,750
So when you get too much stress on
your muscle, your brain says, hey,

951
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:41,550
that's too much stress. You're going to
stop the muscle contraction or let off.

952
00:57:41,551 --> 00:57:45,090
Usually it stops it. That's why if
you go for a two rep Max, one rep Max,

953
00:57:45,091 --> 00:57:48,120
you can get it here and then you
just poop and it fails. You fail.

954
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:53,010
But if you can get, if the, if it
doesn't fire, you'll go and you'll push,

955
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:56,280
you'll push. Sometimes you'll
pause and you can still put like,

956
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:00,720
why did you just fail the other time? You
know what I mean? Yeah, it's that. So,

957
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,070
um, and then if you go
to lower intensity stuff,

958
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:10,200
then it goes more into the glyco like
you ever seen like a marathon runner or

959
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,380
you know,
some real long like I don't know,

960
00:58:13,381 --> 00:58:16,310
an obstacle courses where the guy's
like mentally you can tell he's,

961
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:20,190
he's not going to quit but his legs
are like shivering and shaking and he,

962
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:23,920
it's like he's almost like he's going
to pass out or something like that. It,

963
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:28,170
so that's more of that. That's like
your physical capability, the energy,

964
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,110
the physical energy system
is failing. That's, you know,

965
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,190
so that's a different thing.
So it's funny that would be bound,

966
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,360
I'm sure when you were in boot
camp or going through buds,

967
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,370
like how many pushups are you going to do?

968
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,860
You're just going to keep doing pushups.
Yeah.

969
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,630
You literally just keep doing push ups
and push ups and push ups and pushups and

970
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:42,921
personable.

971
00:58:42,921 --> 00:58:46,440
Some push ups and push ups and pushups
and sometimes you lay there for on flat

972
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:50,070
on your face for like 20 seconds.
But then they say keep going.

973
00:58:50,071 --> 00:58:53,520
And so you just keep going and then you
keep going for a little while and then

974
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:56,520
you lay on your face for a little while
and then you keep going like you can

975
00:58:56,521 --> 00:58:59,820
just keep going for,
yeah.

976
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:04,821
Unless you get to that now sometimes on
like a run someone would pass out and

977
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:08,650
like that would be that.
Yeah. What's that? Yeah.

978
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:10,650
According to this there would be your,

979
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:14,690
your brain basically shut you to saw you
and you see somebody running at the end

980
00:59:14,691 --> 00:59:18,440
of a marathon and they're like the,
their legs aren't working.

981
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:19,640
That's kind of their body.

982
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,990
They've been able to somehow through
all the pain and all that stuff,

983
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:24,650
they've been able to put,

984
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:28,490
they'd been motivated to push through and
then finally your body gets to a point

985
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:30,680
that if we keep going,
we are going to die,

986
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:35,210
so I'm shutting you down and it just hits
the hits the shutdown button and then

987
00:59:35,211 --> 00:59:36,300
your legs a stop where I just,

988
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:40,400
it will just stop contracting your
muscles or I don't remember how we got on

989
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,234
this subject.

990
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,900
Yeah. Pushing through.
The engine is still going,

991
00:59:46,901 --> 00:59:50,020
but the fuel doesn't get to the engine.
So the engine starts,

992
00:59:50,021 --> 00:59:52,360
you know that there's a
little math on situation,

993
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:56,550
but in like a higher intensity stuff,
it's, it seems like, you know, he'd,

994
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:59,560
given what I, what I know about
the Golgi tendon organ situation,

995
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:02,950
it seems like you're a Golgi tendon
expert. Yes. But we'll hear, this is,

996
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,970
this is when I really, I learned about
it in college, but when I tore my bicep,

997
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:07,940
you know,
you know,

998
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,010
guys will lift real hard and just tear
their muscle off the bone because when

999
01:00:12,011 --> 01:00:15,430
you train heavy, you're
training to, to, um,

1000
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,640
to what he's done to mitigate the
effects of the Golgi tendon or that's,

1001
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,820
or like huge rushes of adrenaline.
And we'll do it too. You know,

1002
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:24,700
you hear the story about them,
the lady, she saw the car,

1003
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,650
left the car off the kid off the kid.
Yeah.

1004
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:29,320
So basically you're just
bypassing the Golgi tendon,

1005
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:33,790
Oregon because of these
extreme situations. But by
nature, try lift up a car,

1006
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:38,320
you kind of can't. And the same, I mean
the, you know the, well most of us can,

1007
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,770
but when you do like a
one rep Max like Uber,

1008
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:48,490
when you test for that and you see it
all the time where you know the guy,

1009
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:51,970
let's say, I don't know, he does
three 55 right? Like he even,

1010
01:00:51,971 --> 01:00:54,910
there's like a pause because he's pushing
so hard and he's barely any Guinea

1011
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,820
gets it put on three 65 pounds more.

1012
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,760
He gets it like a quarter of the way up
and it just falls on his chest, you know,

1013
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:04,510
because it fires and boom muscle shutdown.
That's what that is.

1014
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:06,360
Yeah.
And when you're doing the heavy,

1015
01:01:06,361 --> 01:01:10,980
you're also teaching your kind of
teaching your body to most people can only

1016
01:01:10,981 --> 01:01:14,370
contract 30% of their muscles at one time
because their brain doesn't let them,

1017
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:17,220
cause if they attracted all of your
muscle fibers at the same time,

1018
01:01:17,221 --> 01:01:20,460
it could produce an injury.
So when you lift heavy,

1019
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:25,470
your brain has kind of
learning, all right, I can,
I can can drag this many. Oh,

1020
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:28,290
okay, now I can contract this many.
And like the best people still can.

1021
01:01:28,291 --> 01:01:32,490
Only contract like 50% of their, their
muscle five Olympic lifters. Yeah.

1022
01:01:32,491 --> 01:01:36,690
That's like, cause they're
just, yeah, exactly. Or like
really heavy power lifters.

1023
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:40,900
Mm. So now on the,

1024
01:01:40,901 --> 01:01:45,190
on the last podcast we talked
about the Paralympic growing. So,

1025
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,360
and we talked about you biking
across across the country again,

1026
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,720
which is from Maine to San Diego.
And we,

1027
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,240
and again if you want to get people
should go listen to those on,

1028
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,200
on podcasts 92 and, but, but
when you were on last time,

1029
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:02,470
you were talking about
your latest announcement,

1030
01:02:02,471 --> 01:02:05,460
your latest goal that you had written
down in and announced to everybody,

1031
01:02:05,470 --> 01:02:10,470
which was that you were going
to run 31 marathons in 31 days,

1032
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:14,080
which is just kind of um,
a little bit psycho.

1033
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:18,370
And actually you wrote down,
I'm going to read this excerpt from your,

1034
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,430
from your online journal.

1035
01:02:22,130 --> 01:02:22,720
Okay.

1036
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,200
Here we go. Back to the journal. I can't,

1037
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:30,850
this is an expression that is vilified
in our minds beginning at a young age.

1038
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:34,540
Every time a young child announces
this decision, they are corrected.

1039
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,400
The first adult that hears it, ask them
whether or not they have even tried.

1040
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:43,210
Generally, this confrontation will
result in the child giving their task.

1041
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,930
Another attempts until their attention
span moves on to something else.

1042
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,250
The adult will see this and chuckle to
themselves with knowledge that this is

1043
01:02:51,251 --> 01:02:56,020
just a child who has yet to learn the
art of art and virtue of perseverance.

1044
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:58,750
By the time this child comes of age,
however,

1045
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:02,560
they will have been told by adults more
times than they could count that there

1046
01:03:02,561 --> 01:03:04,720
is no such thing as can't.

1047
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:10,090
It is interesting then to think about
how many adults seem to proclaim this

1048
01:03:10,091 --> 01:03:13,180
expression in their lives.
It is because,

1049
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:16,930
is it because like many things
that adults tell children,

1050
01:03:16,931 --> 01:03:20,740
they are simply telling the
child a general rule that
the child must follow but

1051
01:03:20,741 --> 01:03:25,741
can be broken once one has grown or
is it because these adults are simply

1052
01:03:25,811 --> 01:03:30,280
repeating what they were told as children
without thoroughly examining what the

1053
01:03:30,281 --> 01:03:33,670
phrase I can't truly suggests.

1054
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,040
If you confronted an adult that claims
they can't do something with the same

1055
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:41,050
question about whether
or not they have tried,

1056
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:43,240
the answer will almost always be yes.

1057
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:48,490
Adults have learned enough to know that
it is unreasonable to say they can't

1058
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,130
until they have at least tried once.
Therefore,

1059
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:54,850
the real question that we
should be asking in responses,

1060
01:03:54,910 --> 01:03:56,830
have you tried everything?

1061
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:03,560
Have you exhausted every possible
option, scenario, combination,

1062
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:05,330
tool and approach?

1063
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,130
I do not simply refer to the ones that
you knew of at the time you decided to

1064
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:11,300
undertake your task.

1065
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,440
I mean have you re also researched
possibilities that you had known about?

1066
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:20,540
Have you determined whether or not there
is another person out there that has

1067
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:24,440
performed the exact same task you are
attempting or at least something similar?

1068
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:30,410
Have you exhausted this research? Have
you read every book, blog, Journal,

1069
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:33,590
magazine,
bathroom stall and website?

1070
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:39,110
If the answer to any of these questions
is no, then go back and try again.

1071
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,980
Because if you don't because you don't
truly know if you can do something until

1072
01:04:42,981 --> 01:04:45,020
you've tried absolutely everything.

1073
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:49,820
The fact of the matter
is that rarely if ever,

1074
01:04:49,821 --> 01:04:53,120
is the answer to all of these questions.
Yes.

1075
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,740
Therefore, what is it that people
actually mean when they say,

1076
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:02,770
I can't a more accurate but more
verbose way of saying it would be,

1077
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:09,190
I don't care about or want enough this
task or the results and benefits of it in

1078
01:05:11,691 --> 01:05:15,020
order to do all that is
necessary to achieve it.

1079
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:21,130
I was told countless numbers of times
by people during my month of marathons

1080
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,850
that they couldn't run one marathon,
let alone 31 straight.

1081
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:29,590
Every now and then when I had time,
I would discuss what they'd said.

1082
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,200
We would jointly conclude that if
something they cared about and depended on

1083
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:37,840
them doing so,
it would be possible.

1084
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:43,450
The most common example I used was if
someone had a gun to your child's head,

1085
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:48,040
do you think you could
do it? Then therefore,

1086
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:48,910
the phrase,

1087
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:53,650
I can't denotes a lack of investment
as opposed to a lack of potential or

1088
01:05:53,651 --> 01:05:54,484
ability.

1089
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:59,830
I do not mean to say that every person
I had this conversation with should have

1090
01:05:59,831 --> 01:06:03,850
had the motivation to run marathons.
It was something that I decided to do,

1091
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:08,830
not them. I merely wanted to express
to them what I am expressing here.

1092
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,130
Given the right purpose and enough time,

1093
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,133
you can,

1094
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:16,100
okay,

1095
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,770
what happens if someone
has said they can't?

1096
01:06:19,790 --> 01:06:24,790
We have asked them if they've
done everything and the
rare cases happen and they

1097
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:32,780
honestly say yes. Do we concede
that then they can't? Nope.

1098
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,860
If everything in existence
has been attempted enough
to determine that it won't

1099
01:06:36,861 --> 01:06:38,690
work,
then congratulations.

1100
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:43,820
You've been awarded the honor of being
the person who must invent the method or

1101
01:06:43,821 --> 01:06:48,290
the tool or determine the right
combination, whether or not you will.

1102
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,010
Once again boils down to
how much you care and time.

1103
01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:56,780
It may end up being that a person
ends up trying for their entire life.

1104
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,440
But I suggest removing the phrase I
can't from your lexicon and replacing it

1105
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:05,600
with,
I can't yet.

1106
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:07,350
Okay.

1107
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:12,350
Do this so that you don't risk being
on your death bed saying I didn't.

1108
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:17,670
Okay.

1109
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:22,500
So, yeah, and I don't mean to like
if somebody comes up and says,

1110
01:07:22,501 --> 01:07:26,290
I can't do something, I'm not going
to say, I'm not going to, you know,

1111
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:30,900
and I know what they're really
saying. Um, and I don't,

1112
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,540
I'm not going to judge them
and I don't care if you,

1113
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,430
if you don't care about this thing
and it doesn't matter to me, but, uh,

1114
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:43,320
you should just be a little bit
more accurate in what you're saying.

1115
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:46,500
You know, I'm not, like if you, if you
say I can't run a marathon, that's fine.

1116
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,570
That's fine. You don't, you
don't want to run a marathon.

1117
01:07:48,571 --> 01:07:50,100
You don't care about running.
It doesn't matter to you.

1118
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:54,420
And that's your personal choice, you know?
But, uh, to say that you can't do it,

1119
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:59,400
having never even attempted it, uh,
is just not an accurate statement.

1120
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:03,960
So where'd you get the idea to
attempt 31 marathons in 31 days?

1121
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,320
So, uh, after my bike ride,

1122
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:12,520
I tried to make the Paralympics for
triathlon and I did not succeed.

1123
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:15,860
I failed and that attempt,
but with every failure,

1124
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:17,630
there is a lesson learned.

1125
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:20,840
And I learned when I was training for
a triathlon that I was pretty good at

1126
01:08:20,841 --> 01:08:24,280
running.
I was able to run the five k triathlon,

1127
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:27,710
a five k distance at the end of
the triathlon at 18 minutes flat,

1128
01:08:27,711 --> 01:08:32,480
which is pretty fast. That's, that's
maxing out the Marine Corps. Pft.

1129
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:37,310
You can't get any faster than that.
And so it's pretty fast. So I, and I,

1130
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:39,430
I realized, you know, I, I've,

1131
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:44,420
I've decent a decent talent for running
and I'd run the Marine Corps marathon

1132
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:47,300
the year before and I,
so I knew that I could run a marathon

1133
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,800
and I was just kind of,
you know,

1134
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:53,150
after this failed attempt
to make the Paralympics,

1135
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:55,190
cause it's kind of thinking about
what my next mission could be.

1136
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,950
And I wanted to do another
thing like my bike ride.

1137
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:03,470
And I had heard about other people
doing this kind of thing where they do,

1138
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,550
you know, 50 marathons in 50 days
in 50 states or 50 iron mans,

1139
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:10,340
50 days in 50 states. So, you know,

1140
01:09:10,341 --> 01:09:13,930
I decided I wanted to do marathons,
um,

1141
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,830
and I kind of put my own little spin
on it and I said, well, you know what,

1142
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:22,670
I want to get this story and in
front of as many eyeballs as I can.

1143
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:28,060
So to do 50 minute earth to do 31 marathon
straight in my backyard isn't really

1144
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:32,960
going to do that.
So I need to do,

1145
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:36,590
I could go down to the trail everyday for
31 straight and do it and nobody would

1146
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,930
ever care and nobody would
ever find out about it.

1147
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:44,150
And it'd be the same amount of, it'd
be just as impressive to do. Um,

1148
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,350
and so all right, I want to get this in
front of as many eyeballs as possible.

1149
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:52,250
So I need to do it in major cities where
there's a lot of people that can find

1150
01:09:52,251 --> 01:09:55,100
out about it and spread it that
way. And so I figured, all right,

1151
01:09:55,101 --> 01:10:00,101
I'll take that same formula and do 31
marathons and all in different cities.

1152
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:06,650
And I picked 31 because I was trying
to figure if a good number. So I,

1153
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,690
I started with the 20 number,

1154
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:12,050
which is the number associated with
number of veterans suicides every day.

1155
01:10:12,051 --> 01:10:15,890
I figured that'd be a pretty powerful
number. But after thinking about that,

1156
01:10:15,891 --> 01:10:19,490
I kind of figured it wasn't enough.

1157
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,350
It wasn't enough marathons in a row.

1158
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,520
And I figured by the time,
more marathons,

1159
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,220
by the time I got
started with that I'd be,

1160
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:32,210
and by the time I got kind of some
momentum going and pretty much be over,

1161
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:35,510
and so I didn't figure to have it as
big an impact. So I wanted to do more.

1162
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:39,830
So I was like, well what about
50 and so I was like, well, okay,

1163
01:10:39,831 --> 01:10:42,440
50 I could probably do it
if I train enough for it,

1164
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:47,870
but 50 might be too many,
it might be too long.

1165
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:51,380
So by the time I started getting
going and then I, you know,

1166
01:10:51,381 --> 01:10:55,150
I'm at 40 I still have 10 more people
are going to kind of maybe lose interest

1167
01:10:55,151 --> 01:10:57,830
and be like, oh, is that
guy still doing that?

1168
01:10:58,130 --> 01:11:03,020
Because I found out about the iron
cowboy doing his 50 iron mans in 50 days.

1169
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,050
And I kind of had that same
thing where I was like, Oh hey,

1170
01:11:06,051 --> 01:11:06,651
this is gonna be awesome.

1171
01:11:06,651 --> 01:11:09,980
I was following him for the first couple
of weeks and then eventually I'm like,

1172
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:14,280
oh, does he still is either finish it? Oh
Wow. I kind of lost it. And so I'm like,

1173
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,990
all right,
well what if I just did it for a month?

1174
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:18,840
I think people could probably
pay attention for a month.

1175
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:21,420
Then we'll really be interested for
a month before they really move on.

1176
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:22,503
It's like all right,
month,

1177
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:27,530
okay month and marathons and longest
month is 31 so I picked 31 and I have to

1178
01:11:29,671 --> 01:11:32,790
say when no,
you're doing,

1179
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,630
you know what you're doing is hard when
you come on Jocko podcasts. And he says,

1180
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:40,200
this is insane. Jocko Willink says
something is insane, you know, it's,

1181
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:42,030
it's the right level of intensity.

1182
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:46,910
So what kind of miles did you put into
get ready for it and how long did you

1183
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,863
train for it?

1184
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:48,600
Um,

1185
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:53,370
my total a trained about 18
months for this specifically.

1186
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:58,580
And I say that knowing that I had been
an athlete training just about twice a

1187
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:02,430
day,
every day for five years at the time.

1188
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:06,210
So I had that huge history of
being an athlete to begin with.

1189
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:10,050
And then on top of that I put the 18
months of training specifically for this.

1190
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:15,480
And so the way it would
work would be I would run,

1191
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,100
I would do six week, a six
week block, uh, where, um,

1192
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,650
where I was applying a certain stress.

1193
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,740
And so my first six week block would be,

1194
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:28,650
I was as basically just working
on getting long distance.

1195
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:32,730
Cause when I was running triathlons I
only ever did, you know, five k Max.

1196
01:12:33,330 --> 01:12:37,380
So I would run an hour,
I'll probably run three times a week,

1197
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:41,820
it'd be an hour or 90 minutes and another
hour and they'd be spaced out by a

1198
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:43,980
couple of days.
So I do six weeks of that.

1199
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:48,180
And then I would do a little test block
and my first test block was running the

1200
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:49,350
Marine Corps marathon again.

1201
01:12:49,890 --> 01:12:54,890
So there's one marathon and then I do
another six week chunk where I would

1202
01:12:55,081 --> 01:12:57,930
change the stress and make it a
little bit harder. So I would do,

1203
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:02,400
I would either run a little bit longer
on my really long run for the week or I

1204
01:13:02,401 --> 01:13:03,870
would block them together,

1205
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:07,650
maybe like run an hour and a half
Wednesday and then run an hour Thursday,

1206
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:11,070
kind of change up the,
the blocking.

1207
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:15,150
And after that six weeks I would do
again and I would do two marathons.

1208
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:18,930
And the first time I attempted
to marathons actually failed.
I didn't, I couldn't,

1209
01:13:18,931 --> 01:13:23,160
I ran the first one. The next day I ran
maybe half marathon and I, and I quit.

1210
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:23,690
I was like,
okay.

1211
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:27,020
Had you already said you were going to run
31 marathons? Yeah. At this point. Yeah.

1212
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,330
That's reassuring. Yeah. All right.

1213
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:35,140
But I kind of knew already
one or two, two, two.

1214
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,910
Oh, I told my friends was like,
yeah, I tried to run to and I didn't,

1215
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:41,900
they were like,
but what was it?

1216
01:13:41,901 --> 01:13:42,950
What was the failure based on?

1217
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:46,650
Um, I didn't eat enough,
uh, the day before.

1218
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:51,030
So the re part of the reason I was doing
these tasks blocks was figuring out

1219
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,600
first of all, pacing, you know, good with
different at different ways to pace it.

1220
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:59,310
Does that make sure I didn't blow up and
then figuring out how much I needed to

1221
01:13:59,311 --> 01:14:03,630
eat and figuring out, you know,
what it was going to feel like.

1222
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:08,610
And so that first time I attempted to,
I didn't eat enough carbs, uh, the day,

1223
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,010
uh, you know, after that first marathon,

1224
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:15,010
so I was just totally depleted the next
day. So it was like, okay, I didn't,

1225
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:20,430
it wasn't a lack of willpower or a
lack of kind of ability at that time.

1226
01:14:20,681 --> 01:14:24,970
It was just my approach
at that time wasn't, uh,

1227
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:26,560
wasn't right. So I was like, okay,

1228
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:30,700
I didn't really panic about that because
I knew I Kinda knew what happened.

1229
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,710
And so like, all right. And so
I go and then I do six index,

1230
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:37,810
kind of just repeated that
for the year and a half,

1231
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:42,490
where six week chunk and I just change it,
block them together a little bit more,

1232
01:14:42,491 --> 01:14:43,324
run longer.

1233
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:48,370
And then I tried three marathons and I
succeeded and it was pretty easy on an

1234
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:53,070
easy, but you know, it's, I was
like, all right, just three. Yeah,

1235
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,640
I don't feel that bad,
you know?

1236
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:59,170
And then I did another six weeks and
changing the stress again longer and

1237
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:04,780
blocked together more. I rent five
and I was like, all right, five. Okay.

1238
01:15:04,870 --> 01:15:07,000
And I would mess around with a different,

1239
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,940
a different pacing strategies,
different ways of breaking up the Ma,

1240
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:13,180
each marathon,
uh,

1241
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,300
taking breaks and that kind of thing and
eating different foods just to see how

1242
01:15:18,671 --> 01:15:23,620
all that, I would react to that. And then
after five I was like, you know what,

1243
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:24,100
I'm going to,

1244
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,650
I'm not going to do any more than
five because if I do more than five,

1245
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:30,370
I'm just going to want to keep going. I
don't really want to. So five is enough.

1246
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,050
I felt really good after five.

1247
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:37,030
And then after that I just kinda trained
through for maybe three more months,

1248
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:41,020
but I kept every six weeks
I kept adding more mileage.

1249
01:15:41,050 --> 01:15:45,100
And so the last 12 weeks I was
running a marathon every Thursday.

1250
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:46,623
And

1251
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:50,120
how many total miles where
you putting in a week

1252
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:57,170
and that lasts 12 weeks,
probably 60 like my, my,

1253
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,070
you know how they say a dead
lifts starts at 135 pounds,

1254
01:16:01,071 --> 01:16:04,130
you know like my runs but
start at two hours, you know,

1255
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:07,280
I wouldn't do anything less
than two hours. And then yeah,

1256
01:16:07,281 --> 01:16:10,130
I would do that marathon on Thursday
and I would run two hours the day before

1257
01:16:10,131 --> 01:16:14,810
and two hours of the day after.
And the reason I was doing that was this,

1258
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:16,370
get this run a marathon.

1259
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:20,810
So many times leading up to it that the
thought of running one marathon isn't

1260
01:16:20,811 --> 01:16:23,060
really, it's a norm.
It became normal to me.

1261
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:28,900
And so I was trying to get that mental
to to run a marathon at the pace at your

1262
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:34,010
sustained 31 day pace at my
sustained, it was interesting. So

1263
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:38,220
we run in like eight minute miles,
nine minute miles.

1264
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:42,440
Usually it would, it would be between
eight 30 and nine minute miles.

1265
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:47,890
And it was interesting because in the
summertime I was running like a four and a

1266
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:51,230
half hour marathon of total running time.

1267
01:16:51,620 --> 01:16:54,680
And so all the predictions I
put on my website was like, oh,

1268
01:16:54,681 --> 01:16:58,700
I'm probably going to finish in
about this amount of time. But I had,

1269
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,880
that was during the hot and
humid summer in Virginia,

1270
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,670
whereas when I was doing this,
it was in the fall time,

1271
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:07,940
so I was actually able to run faster
and people would come out and say,

1272
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,340
well that you,
yeah,

1273
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:13,280
you said you're going to be running
like nine 10 minute marathon,

1274
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:17,210
10 minute miles, then you run an
eight 30 or eight or nine minutes.

1275
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:18,620
And it was kind of,
it was,

1276
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:23,621
what else was interesting was I
figured my first marathon would be,

1277
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:29,270
I'd be fresh and that'd be my fastest
marathon. And so that was in London.

1278
01:17:29,271 --> 01:17:33,080
It was about four hours roughly
of running time with breaks.

1279
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:36,290
I would take three 20 minute breaks,
four hours of running time,

1280
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:41,420
and then it Kinda did
follow that trajectory where
Philadelphia in New York and

1281
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:43,430
Boston were a little bit slower,

1282
01:17:43,610 --> 01:17:48,170
like four oh five four
15 somewhere in there.

1283
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:51,020
And then after I got there,
I actually started getting faster.

1284
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,290
So the next all the way into Chicago,

1285
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:59,291
my fastest one was my 10th one in
Chicago was three 50 and of running time.

1286
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:02,570
And then after that it kind
of does level off and I'd be,

1287
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:05,090
I'd usually be going somewhere
between three 50 and four hours.

1288
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,100
The human body's amazing.
Yeah.

1289
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,270
And all this stuff that I've been able
to adapt to and even I still wasn't able

1290
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:15,710
to predict that I would actually
get faster. I didn't expect that.

1291
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:20,710
And so I mean this goes to show you that
the body can adapt to even more than

1292
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:21,680
you think.

1293
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:26,680
What are the biggest challenges of regular
running and running with prosthetics

1294
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:29,630
on? So yeah, one of the,

1295
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:34,900
one of the things I had to figure out
was one of the things I learned and the,

1296
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,170
my first and second Marine Corp Marathon
was that I needed to figure out how I

1297
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:42,740
was going to prevent skin breakdown.
So prevent,

1298
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:48,250
I would run after my first marathon I ran
and then I took my legs off and it was

1299
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:51,324
this blood.

1300
01:18:51,420 --> 01:18:55,370
I'd like take the liner off and just
blood just shot everywhere and it wasn't

1301
01:18:55,371 --> 01:18:59,600
all blood, but it was like kind of blood
mixed with sweat. It was like, oh my God,

1302
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:02,900
what did I do to myself? Did I,
I was, I was scared. I was like,

1303
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:05,330
did I mess up my skin graft is that thing,

1304
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,100
because those things can
be kind of sensitive.

1305
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,210
And it ended up just being
a little blister like,

1306
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,720
or a little lights bribed the skin off.
And that's like the size of that big.

1307
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:19,070
But I knew if I did that ran again the
next day and that's going to get bigger

1308
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:20,840
and that's going to totally
derail the whole thing.

1309
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:25,841
So I had to figure out a way that I
could avoid getting like my skin rubbing

1310
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:30,710
off.
And so I started messing around.

1311
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:34,580
I wear these things called liner liners
that kind of wick the sweat that kind of

1312
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:37,640
collect the sweat to,
to help with a claim Munis.

1313
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:41,150
And so usually I'll put those on and they
would go all the way around the end of

1314
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,710
my stump.
It'd be like a sock on the end.

1315
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:45,410
So what I did was I cut
that off at the end.

1316
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,340
And so it's kind of basically like a
kind of like a rash guard on my thigh and

1317
01:19:49,341 --> 01:19:53,060
it wouldn't go down to the end
of the stump. So I cut that off.

1318
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,720
You want it to go down to the end. So
what my theory was, it's kind of a cloth,

1319
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:59,050
it's a cloth material. So
what I figured was, and the,

1320
01:19:59,051 --> 01:20:03,470
and the liner itself is a silicone and
I didn't figure that the silicone would

1321
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:05,300
be creating a whole lot of friction.

1322
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:09,630
So what I figured was maybe that
little liner liner, you know,

1323
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:14,030
as comfortable as it was, was it was
still fabric. So it was probably just,

1324
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:17,820
you know, 40,000 steps still
rubbing the skin off. So, all right.

1325
01:20:17,821 --> 01:20:21,090
So I'll cut that off and see what happens.
And that was good,

1326
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:23,970
but it still didn't fix everything.
So what I ended up doing was,

1327
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,860
I just know from my cycling experience,
I'd use shammy cream on my, on your,

1328
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:31,890
but you know, to help prevent
saddle sores. It's like,

1329
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:36,891
well maybe I'll take the shammy cream
and put it on the spots that I know tend

1330
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:39,570
to get rubbed. So I,
I would goop out loud,

1331
01:20:39,571 --> 01:20:43,950
just take a huge group and just
slather it on there. And uh,

1332
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:48,180
and that seemed to fit, that fixed it
pretty good. And so I was like, all right,

1333
01:20:48,181 --> 01:20:49,320
so I figured that method out.

1334
01:20:49,321 --> 01:20:52,710
So that's one of the things is trying to
figure it with running with prosthetics

1335
01:20:52,711 --> 01:20:57,711
is figuring out how to
avoid that skin breakdown.

1336
01:20:58,590 --> 01:21:02,010
Um, and that's Kinda
Numero Uno cause that can,

1337
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:04,290
I mean you can be as strong as you want,
but if your skin,

1338
01:21:04,291 --> 01:21:07,050
if you can't put your leg on
cause the skin hurts so much,

1339
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:11,940
then all that strength that
doesn't, it doesn't matter. So,

1340
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,810
so what'd you do with your diet
where you're just pounding calories?

1341
01:21:14,811 --> 01:21:16,590
I mean just eating everything in sight.
Yeah.

1342
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:20,460
So I approached my diet a little bit
differently than most you might expect for

1343
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,370
marathons. I did a low carb diet, well,

1344
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:27,120
what would be a low car
for this kind of thing?

1345
01:21:27,450 --> 01:21:31,200
So I was using this in all my training
and all my pacing and all my eating.

1346
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:36,201
I did this thing called the maffetone
method and it's basically this guy,

1347
01:21:36,481 --> 01:21:41,481
Phil maffetone figured that you should
do all your training at an a robotic

1348
01:21:41,671 --> 01:21:46,530
level. So he figured out this through
experience, he calculated your,

1349
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:51,030
he came up with an equation to calculate
your maximum aerobic heart rate was 180

1350
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:51,864
minus your age.

1351
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,910
And then there's other little
adjustments you can make to that.

1352
01:21:56,911 --> 01:22:01,270
So my maffetone heart rate
was one 49 and so I see.

1353
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,400
I'd never ran anything over one 49 you're
on a heart rate monitor all the time.

1354
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:10,350
Yeah, I had a uh, Tom Tom Watch, uh,
and I had one and that my wife has one,

1355
01:22:10,351 --> 01:22:14,040
so I had to on when I was running my
marathon just in case one messed up.

1356
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,200
And so I ran all,

1357
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:21,201
I'm all my training and all my marathons
were run at as close to that one 49

1358
01:22:21,391 --> 01:22:25,410
heart rate. And what it does is trains,

1359
01:22:25,411 --> 01:22:28,140
instead of like making you strong,
your muscles stronger,

1360
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,880
it actually trains your cardiovascular
efficiency. So when you start out,

1361
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:37,110
you'll be running at one 49 heart
rate and you'll be pretty slow.

1362
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:42,240
But as you do that more your heart
and lungs will become more and more

1363
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,430
efficient. So eventually you'll be
running at that same one 49 heart rate,

1364
01:22:47,431 --> 01:22:50,850
but you'll be running twice
as fast. Right? Because it's
becoming more efficient.

1365
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,930
So I just approached it like that or I,
I,

1366
01:22:54,170 --> 01:22:58,980
I kind of figured it'd be better to do
it that way because the more glycolysis

1367
01:22:58,981 --> 01:23:03,180
and the more carbohydrates you use,
the more your body's going to have to,

1368
01:23:03,210 --> 01:23:07,330
they're more destructive to
your body. So I'm like, well,

1369
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:08,740
in order to be able to run these,

1370
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:12,700
I have to run them at a maintainable pace
and in a, in a, in a maintainable way.

1371
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:17,170
I can't just go out and run as
fast as I can. Every single one.

1372
01:23:17,171 --> 01:23:21,370
I had to pace it. And so I figured
that's how it was going to pace it. Uh,

1373
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:25,210
keeping my heart rate under
one 50 not using those carbs.

1374
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:30,211
And so that also allowed me to be
able to eat just really high fat.

1375
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:31,480
Um,

1376
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:36,480
I think I had between 150 and 175 grams
of carbs a day and that's what I limited

1377
01:23:37,121 --> 01:23:41,020
it to. And then I would eat, uh,

1378
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:45,300
during the run I would eat
three bonk breaker bars.

1379
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:50,370
I wanted each of my breaks and they're
just like these little energy bars and

1380
01:23:51,191 --> 01:23:51,951
that would keep me going.

1381
01:23:51,951 --> 01:23:54,580
That would be my kind of a lot of carbs
there so that we kind of keep me going

1382
01:23:54,581 --> 01:23:57,370
during the run. I would just drink
water whenever I got thirsty.

1383
01:23:58,030 --> 01:24:00,280
And then after I ran,

1384
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:05,970
we had pre made these pre meet all my
meals and we just made this super calorie

1385
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:12,241
dense cheese and meat sauce that'd be
froze and we put it all in the freezer and

1386
01:24:13,421 --> 01:24:14,980
it was just the densest,
you know,

1387
01:24:14,981 --> 01:24:19,330
the calorie dense this stuff you
could probably be like, you know,

1388
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,990
whole containers and cream
and cheese and all this stuff.

1389
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:27,290
So super dense and my mom would heat up a,

1390
01:24:27,380 --> 01:24:32,290
a bowl of that for me and I would take
a bag of pork rinds and put that in the

1391
01:24:32,530 --> 01:24:35,470
Chile and mix that in there.
And get the whole thing.

1392
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,530
And a lot of the times before I,
before I even ran,

1393
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:43,120
I would eat another bag of pork cracklings
so I'd have two bags of pork rinds,

1394
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:46,720
his big ass bowl of meat
sauce and cheese sauce.

1395
01:24:47,530 --> 01:24:51,400
And then I would eat a sweet potato chips,
things like that.

1396
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,640
If somebody brought us donuts,
I'd have a Donut, you know, uh,

1397
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:03,710
if people as people could see
what just happened to Jocko was I

1398
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:09,340
thought he was going to come
across. Um, so I'd eat that.

1399
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:14,020
And then at the for dinner I'd eat a eggs
and bacon. And the whole time you're,

1400
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:18,220
you got an RV cause cause you did
this in 31 different cities. Yeah.

1401
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:22,780
You started off in London and then he
flew back to America and then started the

1402
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:26,140
grind. New York, Chicago,
just going around the country.

1403
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:31,510
And you a wife and a little
support team was in the RV.

1404
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:37,180
Yup. So it was four of us. It was a Pam.
Like what kind of Rv did you have? Um,

1405
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:41,800
coachmen Mirada, I think it's
like a 35. Do you have a RV?

1406
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:45,110
30 to 35 footer, Huh? Yeah,

1407
01:25:45,111 --> 01:25:49,030
it was class eight 35 foot king size
bed in the back. Oh, that's nice.

1408
01:25:50,110 --> 01:25:52,600
Good.
And RVs know as long as you're not moving.

1409
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,410
I don't know why I sleep like
a baby in RVs. I slept well,

1410
01:25:56,411 --> 01:26:00,700
but it's not totally comfortable when
you're driving down the highway at 60.

1411
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,890
It's pretty bouncy back there.
And actually it made it,

1412
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:08,180
this is something I didn't expect was
it made it kind of hard to eat being in

1413
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:09,230
the back.
So I'd be,

1414
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:13,520
I'd have to eat all this stuff and by
being in the back of that Rv for five,

1415
01:26:13,521 --> 01:26:17,330
six hours, I would start to
get a little bit my appetite,

1416
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:20,780
we just going to go away more bouncy
than being in the front. Oh yeah.

1417
01:26:20,781 --> 01:26:25,520
Big Time behind the axle and
there's so much weight. Yeah.
Uh, yeah. So it'd be Pam,

1418
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:30,740
my wife, team leader. Uh, she drove some,

1419
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:34,580
she drove a lot. Uh, any, I wasn't even,

1420
01:26:34,581 --> 01:26:39,320
I wasn't really in charge of the were
just day to day. Yeah. My job was, yeah,

1421
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:43,700
exactly. Well run when I
needed to run, when I need to
do interviews, run my mouth,

1422
01:26:44,780 --> 01:26:48,140
do that. And then that was it
pretty much. And then, but Pam,

1423
01:26:48,260 --> 01:26:52,820
she was doing everything,
you know, driving,

1424
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:55,190
uh, setting up, scheduling
all my interviews,

1425
01:26:55,191 --> 01:26:59,140
working with these reporters and they're
like, oh, we want to do this at six 30.

1426
01:26:59,160 --> 01:26:59,841
Can we make that happen?

1427
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:04,490
She's schedule it in and then
calling ahead to the venues
that we had decided to,

1428
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:08,630
to run at, you know, squaring that away.
Okay, where can we park? We're coming now.

1429
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:09,680
Um,

1430
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:12,230
and there's probably so many other jobs
that I didn't even know about that she

1431
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:16,590
was doing. Um, and then,
you know, it's taken on a,

1432
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:21,500
a boat load of stress for
her. And then, um, my mom,

1433
01:27:21,501 --> 01:27:24,080
would she be kind of Pam's assistant,

1434
01:27:24,081 --> 01:27:28,220
she be in charge of kind of keeping
me fed and hydrated during when I was

1435
01:27:28,221 --> 01:27:29,870
running and making sure
I didn't need anything.

1436
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,420
And then afterwards she
would make my meals.

1437
01:27:32,750 --> 01:27:36,170
And then one of her most important
jobs was, she's a massage therapist.

1438
01:27:36,171 --> 01:27:39,710
So she'd give me two massages
every day, uh, after I ran,

1439
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:44,780
while we were driving to the next place.
And then I also had a driver who, uh,

1440
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,410
who did most of the driving and then he,
uh,

1441
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:51,650
he just kind of helped out
around the, uh, the RV.

1442
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:55,010
Like whatever Pam needed him
to do something he would do it.

1443
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:56,750
Or what kind of people
joined you on the runs?

1444
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,640
I know you said you were
telling me yesterday some,

1445
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:03,020
some Royal Marines in England. Oh yeah.
Joined you got it out there. I mean,

1446
01:28:03,050 --> 01:28:07,790
tons of military. Um,
if I had to categorize,

1447
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:09,913
I mean it just people,

1448
01:28:10,100 --> 01:28:12,920
people from all walks of life and your
ultra runners would find out about it and

1449
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:17,810
people that ran, people that didn't even
run would come out a lot of military.

1450
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:23,000
Um, I would say 50% of the people
though that came out, I'd say,

1451
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:27,710
how'd you hear about this? They
say, Jocko pocket, no bullshit. 50.

1452
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:31,940
At least 50% of them. Um, the
troopers are not playing around.

1453
01:28:34,150 --> 01:28:39,090
They're doing major support. And then,
uh, he has to be a lot of millet.

1454
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:42,470
A lot of guys that I deployed with
came out and supported a lot of cops,

1455
01:28:42,471 --> 01:28:45,510
a lot of fire departments.
Uh, but you know, it's, it,

1456
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,450
there really wasn't one niche. It was
just even kids would come out. Yeah.

1457
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:52,070
Kids would come out,
people with their parents,

1458
01:28:52,071 --> 01:28:56,570
a full families would come out for the
day and, and run. Um, it was awesome.

1459
01:28:56,571 --> 01:29:01,310
I had kids that ran their
first ever marathon with,

1460
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:04,590
with me, you know, and a
lot of people would just,

1461
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:07,230
they'd be running their first marathon
and then I had a white lady, she's like,

1462
01:29:07,231 --> 01:29:09,510
well, I'm running a marathon next week,
but I'm going to run one with you.

1463
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,220
And she PB do, you know? And so
it'd be all, all sorts of people.

1464
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:17,430
I'd come out of the RV in the morning
and they're just be people that had been

1465
01:29:17,431 --> 01:29:20,490
waiting there for me to
come out and no matter what.

1466
01:29:20,491 --> 01:29:22,920
And it didn't matter that morning.
Would you start running?

1467
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:28,140
I would usually start around seven. Um,
unless I had some kind of big interview.

1468
01:29:28,141 --> 01:29:30,870
Like I had a Fox and friends
interview when I was in New York,

1469
01:29:30,871 --> 01:29:33,360
so I started at seven 30 or eight.
Uh,

1470
01:29:33,361 --> 01:29:38,190
but I would try and be pretty religious
about starting at seven and then, um,

1471
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:42,780
yeah, people be out there. It didn't
matter if it was 20 degrees in Denver,

1472
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:47,610
they'd be out there. If it was raining,
they'd be out there, you know, it was,

1473
01:29:47,611 --> 01:29:48,444
it was awesome.

1474
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:50,690
That is awesome.
What was the,

1475
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:55,750
what was the hardest part or did
you meet any hard parts during the,

1476
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:59,720
during the trip I was there and actually
I remember when you were getting ready

1477
01:29:59,721 --> 01:30:02,570
to go. Yeah, this is pretty
cool. I'm like, hey man,

1478
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,950
like one if you know what
if you're not gonna make it,

1479
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,950
what if you can't?
And what I was actually thinking about,

1480
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:13,190
I was thinking about your legs and,
and I know that, I mean I've, you know,

1481
01:30:13,191 --> 01:30:17,410
I've got other friends that, that they
have prosthetics and I know that it's a,

1482
01:30:17,510 --> 01:30:20,420
that it's a grind and
it rips your skin apart.

1483
01:30:20,780 --> 01:30:23,570
And I was kind of figured that's what I
was thinking. I wasn't thinking like, Oh,

1484
01:30:23,571 --> 01:30:25,860
you work is going to get tired and quit.
But I was thinking that there,

1485
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:29,780
there might come a point
where you physically weren't
gonna be able to do this

1486
01:30:29,781 --> 01:30:33,920
without, you know, causing
massive damage to your body and,

1487
01:30:33,990 --> 01:30:38,210
and possibly, you know, getting infections
and everything else. And I said,

1488
01:30:38,211 --> 01:30:40,820
you know what, if, what if something
happens and you're like, no, I'm gonna,

1489
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,730
I'm going to finish it. I was
like, okay, well there you have it.

1490
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,580
Yeah. Well, you know, that was something
I was concerned about too. I didn't know,

1491
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:49,760
uh,
how my body was gonna react to it and

1492
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,540
I didn't know for sure.
I never knew even up to the last one,

1493
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:57,680
the last mile,
the last one,

1494
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:01,900
I would never have say I'm definitely
gonna Finish this because you know,

1495
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:06,620
anything can happen.
Cause I could have my prosthetic on,

1496
01:31:06,621 --> 01:31:07,610
twist it a little bit,

1497
01:31:07,611 --> 01:31:10,880
and then that rubs off skin on my
skin graft and then that causes it to,

1498
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,810
to die or something. And then I'm screwed.
And then I had, I can't, you know,

1499
01:31:14,840 --> 01:31:18,620
can't continue. Uh, so I never
knew for sure, but I've, I,

1500
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:23,750
I believed that as long as everything
kind of went according to plan,

1501
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:28,250
then it was possible as long as
no catastrophic events happen. Um,

1502
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:32,810
and I was feeling confident.
I was very confident the whole time.

1503
01:31:32,810 --> 01:31:37,810
And then I got all the way around to
Texas and I had been really lucky with the

1504
01:31:39,051 --> 01:31:40,610
weather all the way around.

1505
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:46,250
We got to Texas and we're hitting a
heat wave in Texas and it was probably,

1506
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:51,320
I woke up in the morning and,
and uh, Houston sweating,

1507
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:55,790
sweating already was ridiculous.
I was just covered in sweat.

1508
01:31:55,791 --> 01:32:00,280
Waking up in Houston. It
was like a hundred percent
humidity, probably like 75,

1509
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,790
80 degrees just to start the
day. Houston gets on, Oh my God.

1510
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:07,800
And he gets to me pretty easily.
It's,

1511
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:09,970
it's the one thing like
a really slow me down,

1512
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:15,280
but I came out of that RV and there were,

1513
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:17,780
and the heat so the heat
can get to you because you,

1514
01:32:17,781 --> 01:32:21,560
you basically are missing a
couple radiators. Oh yeah. I mean,

1515
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:22,790
cause you're your body,

1516
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:27,530
everyone's body gives off a lot of heat
through their legs and you don't have

1517
01:32:27,531 --> 01:32:31,030
those radiators to give off
heat anymore. Yeah. So you, you,

1518
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,750
you can overheat fairly quickly.

1519
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:36,930
Exactly. Um, yeah. And then my am I,

1520
01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:38,830
so in addition to not
having the radiators,

1521
01:32:38,831 --> 01:32:42,790
my legs are in cased and carbon fiber,

1522
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:46,630
so it's actually bottling in the
heat on my legs instead. So, uh,

1523
01:32:46,631 --> 01:32:48,220
it can really slow me down.

1524
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:52,330
But I came out of that RV and Houston and

1525
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,450
there was just 70 people
there waiting for me to run.

1526
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:01,140
And a lot of them were marines.
There's a vocal,

1527
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:04,440
a marine recruiting office that came
out and they brought their pool,

1528
01:33:04,441 --> 01:33:06,700
these people that were about
to go to bootcamp. Awesome.

1529
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:10,630
And they brought them out. And I'm like,
well, it doesn't matter. You know, I,

1530
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:14,180
I'm gonna, I'm not, even if they weren't
there, I still would've, you know, ran it.

1531
01:33:14,181 --> 01:33:16,780
Yeah. But I'm like, man, look at all
these people that want to run with me.

1532
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:19,900
And so I just did it. And
then it just, it took a long,

1533
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:21,190
I think that was probably my longest,

1534
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:26,800
was probably four and a half hours of
a running and that was a guy in his

1535
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:28,630
regular wheelchair that did
it with me the whole time,

1536
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:34,220
just real and in his wheelchair behind
me. Um, so that was a really tough date.

1537
01:33:34,221 --> 01:33:36,100
So that San Antonio, Houston, Dallas,

1538
01:33:36,101 --> 01:33:40,650
we're all really hot and really humid
and I had to do back to back to back. Uh,

1539
01:33:40,660 --> 01:33:43,450
but I got through it because people came
out and ran with me and he like kept me

1540
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,930
going. And um, and then in Nashville,

1541
01:33:48,130 --> 01:33:49,110
I,
it was,

1542
01:33:49,150 --> 01:33:53,110
it had been raining that day and I was
running on a trail and there were these

1543
01:33:53,111 --> 01:33:58,111
wooden bridges over these little creeks
and I had run on wooden British before,

1544
01:33:59,261 --> 01:34:01,480
so I knew they were going to be
slippery. And I was like, all right,

1545
01:34:01,481 --> 01:34:03,190
I'm going to take it slow over this.
And I still,

1546
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:07,900
I slipped on this bridge
and injured my back.

1547
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,050
Not at the time, it didn't feel like I
ended it at the time. I was like, hmm,

1548
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:12,460
that's was kind of a hard fall.

1549
01:34:12,460 --> 01:34:15,880
And I kept running the next
day when I woke up in Atlanta,

1550
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:20,110
my back was killing me and it was,
I had four left.

1551
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:24,970
And um, I just had to
gut it out, you know,

1552
01:34:24,971 --> 01:34:29,920
every time I landed on my right foot is
like kind of shot up bad pain into my,

1553
01:34:29,921 --> 01:34:31,000
into my middle back.

1554
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:35,080
And it was a little bit
frustrating because I was like,

1555
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,840
I was feeling so good up to that point.

1556
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:41,950
And I had run a super
fast marathon in Memphis.

1557
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:44,560
I was feeling so good. I was like, Oh man,

1558
01:34:44,561 --> 01:34:48,640
I'm going to be able to really enjoy these
last four, you know? And then, you know,

1559
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,680
the university is like, nope, you're
going to have to earn it. Sorry.

1560
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:54,220
You're going to have to earn it.
It would

1561
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:57,980
cruise these last four days. And then
you finished up on veteran's day? Yeah,

1562
01:34:58,280 --> 01:35:02,370
in, in DC, in DC veteran's day. Um,

1563
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:05,900
and my back was fin a little
bit better at this point,

1564
01:35:05,901 --> 01:35:07,850
but still hurting pretty bad.

1565
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:12,950
And it was interesting because
all up until that point, my,

1566
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,010
my stumps were feeling pretty good.
They had,

1567
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,480
I started to get these little pockets of
fluid on that kind of the outer corner

1568
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:24,950
of both of them and they hurt,
um, when I pushed on them.

1569
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,100
And then usually for the first
mile they would hurt pretty bad.

1570
01:35:28,520 --> 01:35:32,630
And it got to a point where my mom
had this like Kinda IcyHot spray.

1571
01:35:32,631 --> 01:35:36,920
She was spraying that on, on the
ends every day to help. And so,

1572
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:40,070
but after the first mile,
that pain would kind of go away.

1573
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:43,910
I would just pound them into submission
or whatever and they would be like,

1574
01:35:43,911 --> 01:35:45,020
all right,
you're just going to keep going.

1575
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:48,590
We're just going to turn
ourselves off or whatever. And uh,

1576
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:52,580
so after the first mile I'd be good and
they wouldn't really hurt it much more

1577
01:35:52,581 --> 01:35:57,320
until the next day. Yeah.
It's like he hears us,

1578
01:35:57,321 --> 01:36:01,460
he hears this, he's going to keep
doing it. Um, and yeah, and yeah,

1579
01:36:01,461 --> 01:36:03,680
so after the first mile would be,
they'd be fine,

1580
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:08,060
but on that last day in Washington,
DC, they just never turned off.

1581
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:12,770
And I think maybe it was because it was
that same thing where I knew this was

1582
01:36:12,771 --> 01:36:15,710
the last one in my body,
kind of knew what was the last one.

1583
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:18,260
So it was starting to maybe let itself,

1584
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:21,530
I would have held on to that last one
that maybe this is starting to let itself

1585
01:36:21,531 --> 01:36:22,550
unravel a little bit.

1586
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:27,350
And so that whole last day
was just paint in the back,

1587
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:30,200
freezing cold.
It was like 20 degrees out.

1588
01:36:30,890 --> 01:36:34,880
And so every time I stopped to rest
I was sweating. I was like, you know,

1589
01:36:34,881 --> 01:36:35,990
I had a hot water bottle.

1590
01:36:35,991 --> 01:36:40,310
I was all snuggled up with under a
blanket and I would still be like cold,

1591
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:44,840
but just the sheer number of people
that were there. I never was. I,

1592
01:36:46,160 --> 01:36:48,980
there was never less than a hundred
people running with me that entire day.

1593
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,290
It's awesome.
And I had,

1594
01:36:52,210 --> 01:36:56,690
there was people there that had run with
me and other cities that came and came

1595
01:36:56,691 --> 01:37:00,650
from the last one. I had brothers with
me that had deployed to Afghanistan. Uh,

1596
01:37:00,651 --> 01:37:03,710
all they're running with me.
Um,

1597
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:09,110
I had for my last mile,
I had a,

1598
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:13,100
there was a general running,
he was out in front,

1599
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:15,980
so like were running around the
national mall in my last mile around the

1600
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:17,630
reflecting pool was
that it's about a mile.

1601
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,170
And so there was a general out
front and be like clear the way,

1602
01:37:22,150 --> 01:37:23,600
clear people out of the way,
you know.

1603
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,380
And then there was a sergeant major
who had been my company first sergeant

1604
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,440
rhythm.
So they were running like side by side,

1605
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:35,180
no politely telling people
to get out of the way. Uh,

1606
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,820
sergeant major Kent Retired
sergeant major of the Marine Corps,

1607
01:37:40,821 --> 01:37:45,020
top sergeant major in the Marine Corps
was running with me that last, uh,

1608
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:49,010
maybe 12 k singing cadences, you know. Um,

1609
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:54,200
there was, uh, you know, I just had, I had
brothers with me that were in the group,

1610
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:59,640
uh, their kids, you know, uh, Pam joined
me for that last mile. My mom joined me.

1611
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,280
I had family in there for the last mile.

1612
01:38:02,670 --> 01:38:06,000
And before we started that last
mile like gear I prom, it was like,

1613
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:06,661
all right everybody,

1614
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:09,870
I'm going to take this last mile
real slow just so that we can,

1615
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:14,080
everybody can stay together. And then by
the end of them, I was like sprinting, but

1616
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:21,000
just so pumped up, you know,
to be finished. But man,
it was so cool. And I've,

1617
01:38:21,050 --> 01:38:25,410
I, uh, finished that last little
loop and I kind of like ran up.

1618
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:30,180
There's this little curved sidewalk
that goes up to the Lincoln Memorial.

1619
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:34,020
And so I finished that last mile.
I kind of curve it up to that last,

1620
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:38,490
and the whole sidewalk was lined with
folks and then they had set up a little,

1621
01:38:38,491 --> 01:38:40,230
a finish line for me up there.

1622
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:45,690
And the whole thing was just lined
with people like, you know, and uh, uh,

1623
01:38:46,230 --> 01:38:50,730
cross a finish line. Pam was there,
you know, uh, we celebrated, she cried.

1624
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:54,490
I did not cry,
uh,

1625
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:59,730
to make that clear right now I'm
finished, you know, kissed her,

1626
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:04,230
hugged her, and then the,
then the reporters Kinda came
in and started, uh, talking.

1627
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:09,460
Awesome. And, uh, do you, you raise
money? Yeah. You raised money,

1628
01:39:09,461 --> 01:39:13,960
a bunch of money for the,
I know you support a bunch of foundations,

1629
01:39:14,140 --> 01:39:15,370
so that was awesome too.

1630
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:20,050
That was sort of the other driving force
behind you doing it besides just you're

1631
01:39:20,051 --> 01:39:23,800
crazy, but also because you were raising
money for a bunch of good causes.

1632
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,340
Yeah. You know, raising money, we raised
200,000, um, at the time I finished, I,

1633
01:39:28,341 --> 01:39:29,760
I kinda,
I stopped keeping track,

1634
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:33,450
but it's probably like 215 now
or something like that. Uh,

1635
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:36,990
for semper fi fund tunnel to towers
foundation coalition to suit America's

1636
01:39:36,991 --> 01:39:38,970
heroes.
And that was kind of

1637
01:39:40,740 --> 01:39:41,250
okay.

1638
01:39:41,250 --> 01:39:43,860
That was what,
that was kind of how I almost,

1639
01:39:44,790 --> 01:39:45,340
okay.

1640
01:39:45,340 --> 01:39:46,173
Uh,

1641
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:50,530
manifested physically manifested
how successful that was.

1642
01:39:51,280 --> 01:39:53,920
And so my, what I was trying
to do is this, create that,

1643
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:57,610
create a story that
people could feed off of.

1644
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,500
And so
when you,

1645
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:07,030
when you look at all the stories that
are out there about veterans coming back,

1646
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,970
the vast, vast, vast,

1647
01:40:09,971 --> 01:40:14,260
vast majority of stories are
the post traumatic stress story.

1648
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:18,270
Every movie that comes out
that is about OIF, OEF,

1649
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:22,210
veteran coming home is
this pretty much the same.

1650
01:40:23,080 --> 01:40:23,440
Okay.

1651
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:26,800
Uh,
same recipe veteran goes overseas,

1652
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:32,140
they experienced war. They see
some bad stuff like you do in war.

1653
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:37,560
They come back and there a basket case
and they implode and they implode their

1654
01:40:38,291 --> 01:40:40,930
family and all that stuff.
And

1655
01:40:41,700 --> 01:40:42,020
okay,

1656
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:42,500
that's a good,

1657
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,250
that's a hugely important story to
know cause it does happen and it's,

1658
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,350
we have to take care of those guys and
we have to make sure we keep that story

1659
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:53,060
in our,
in the forefront of our minds.

1660
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:58,090
But what started to bother me was that
was the only story that was getting told.

1661
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:03,900
And I think General Mattis said it best
when he answered the question somewhere.

1662
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:06,670
And he said, you know, expectations
are very strong. So if you,

1663
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:11,670
if you go overseas and everybody's
kind of expecting you to, uh,

1664
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:14,200
basically have pts,

1665
01:41:14,680 --> 01:41:19,680
then there's a good chance that you're
going to manifest that in yourself just

1666
01:41:20,530 --> 01:41:22,990
by date, by virtue of the fact
that that's what's expected.

1667
01:41:22,991 --> 01:41:25,930
And so you can just going
to create that. Yeah. Um,

1668
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:28,660
and so what I wanted to do
was get this story out there,

1669
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:33,310
tell a story where there was
a guy that went overseas,

1670
01:41:33,311 --> 01:41:38,311
had a traumatic experience and came
back and was better than he was before.

1671
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,720
And so that was how I determined I was
going to create this story and know I

1672
01:41:43,721 --> 01:41:46,390
felt that I knew that this was a problem,

1673
01:41:46,391 --> 01:41:47,740
that this story wasn't getting out there.

1674
01:41:47,741 --> 01:41:52,741
And also I felt the responsibility
to create it myself.

1675
01:41:52,821 --> 01:41:53,860
And you know,
if it's not out there,

1676
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:56,970
it's like what I was saying in
that I can't a journal, you know,

1677
01:41:56,980 --> 01:42:00,370
I had that responsibility because
it just wasn't out there very much.

1678
01:42:00,760 --> 01:42:03,490
And so I set out to create that
story and then, you know, so if,

1679
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:08,030
if there was a guy that was struggling,
um,

1680
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,580
he could see that story and
then he could see, you know,

1681
01:42:10,690 --> 01:42:15,250
what it actually is possible to go
see war and come back and be fine and,

1682
01:42:15,251 --> 01:42:18,670
or not be necessarily be
totally fine, but, uh,

1683
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:23,590
overcome it and find your new path and
find your new mission and continue on and

1684
01:42:23,591 --> 01:42:28,340
keep fighting for veterans. Keep fighting
for your brothers. And if they've,

1685
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:30,910
if there's a guy that's coming
home and he's kind of on the fence,

1686
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:34,270
he sees that story and maybe
take some of the the right way.

1687
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:38,310
And then at the same time getting it out
there for civilians. Uh, there's, uh,

1688
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:43,380
a major military civilian
gap of Understanding Cause
Military Taryn tends to be

1689
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,010
isolated and on the
basis. And you know, that

1690
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:53,050
I could see that gap because of all
these movies that were coming out.

1691
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:58,051
There's every like 100% of movies that
came out were the main character at PTSD.

1692
01:43:00,010 --> 01:43:05,010
Whereas you look at the statistics and
it's 25% of non combat troops have what

1693
01:43:05,771 --> 01:43:06,940
we'll call PTSD,

1694
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:12,270
7% of combat troops have PTSD.

1695
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:17,910
And so it's a huge
misrepresentation of the actual,

1696
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,100
uh,
of the actual scale.

1697
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,820
And so I wanted to civilians
to see that story. Or here,

1698
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:29,240
here's a veteran that came,
came home and was, you know, he,

1699
01:43:29,241 --> 01:43:33,790
he was able to kind of adapter process,
uh,

1700
01:43:33,791 --> 01:43:34,624
what he'd seen.

1701
01:43:35,150 --> 01:43:39,440
No, I think that's 100% right. And I think
you get, you get, you, you nailed it.

1702
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,490
And Maddis nailed it.

1703
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:43,430
Like you set the expectations that
everyone thinks that when they go to war,

1704
01:43:43,431 --> 01:43:44,510
they're going to be all screwed up.

1705
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:48,680
It's like that's what's going to happen
to them. But if they, if they get told,

1706
01:43:48,681 --> 01:43:53,540
hey, and, and I mean you, you know, you
just, when you came home you were better.

1707
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:58,670
Yeah. And like, that's
awesome. And, uh, you know, I,

1708
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:03,140
I had that conversation with
Sam Harris where, you know,
I, he'd asked me, he said,

1709
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:05,450
hey, you know, you, you get told you,

1710
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:08,210
I hear you saying that war
is horrible and war is hell,

1711
01:44:08,211 --> 01:44:11,810
but at the same time you say that it was
like the best highlight of your life.

1712
01:44:11,811 --> 01:44:15,590
And it was, and I told him, and he's like,
how do you reconcile those two things?

1713
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,500
And I said, well, have you ever
known someone that had cancer?

1714
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,490
And when they get,
if they make it through,

1715
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:26,150
they say it made him a better person
and it wouldn't wish it on anyone,

1716
01:44:26,151 --> 01:44:28,460
but it made him a better person.
And, and, and he said, yeah.

1717
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:32,480
And it made sense to him then. And, and
that's what I think is important thing.

1718
01:44:32,481 --> 01:44:35,690
And, and you know, look at the, I mean,

1719
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:40,010
every war has incredible veterans that
come home and do incredible things.

1720
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:43,220
And I mean, Charlie plumb
when he was on, you know,

1721
01:44:43,221 --> 01:44:45,500
after being in the Hanoi
Hilton for six years,

1722
01:44:45,770 --> 01:44:50,770
and he rattled off the guys that were
in the Hanoi Hilton with him that were,

1723
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:53,450
you know,
presidents and,

1724
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:57,590
and congressmen and just all
these incredible achievements.
Maybe not presidents,

1725
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:01,070
but incredible, incredible
achievements. Well, presidential,

1726
01:45:01,071 --> 01:45:05,720
a candidate with Stockdale,
so, and Ann Mccain, right?
Two presidential candidates.

1727
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:09,020
So,
so incredible achievements.

1728
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:13,700
And yet the,
the media and the Hollywood,

1729
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:17,220
they don't shine the light on that. What
they shine the light on is the, the,

1730
01:45:17,221 --> 01:45:21,170
the people that are having issues, which
again, like you said, that's real too.

1731
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:26,560
But the fact that you made this huge
effort and are continuing to make a huge

1732
01:45:26,931 --> 01:45:29,570
effort to show not just civilians,

1733
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,100
but also military that yeah, wars
bad. I mean, you've, you know,

1734
01:45:34,101 --> 01:45:35,720
you say you had a traumatic experience,

1735
01:45:35,721 --> 01:45:39,500
you had a freaking life
changing experience, and
you've come back and you've,

1736
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:44,530
you've proven that that traumatic
experience is not as strong as you are.

1737
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,670
And I think that's the most
important message that,

1738
01:45:50,300 --> 01:45:53,300
that anyone could communicate
back to both sides,

1739
01:45:53,301 --> 01:45:54,860
both the civilian and military side.

1740
01:45:55,120 --> 01:45:55,953
Yeah.
And I mean,

1741
01:45:56,440 --> 01:46:01,390
there's so much to be said about what
knowing something is already possible.

1742
01:46:01,660 --> 01:46:06,660
So I told you about Dan Kinison last time
I was here and back then he was about

1743
01:46:09,070 --> 01:46:11,890
a year and a half in front of me and he
was showing me what was possible for me.

1744
01:46:11,891 --> 01:46:16,690
I didn't know that it was possible to
be able to walk around and with a huge

1745
01:46:16,691 --> 01:46:21,670
backpack on and using no canes.
But once I saw it, it's like, oh,

1746
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:26,350
so it is bottle.
And it just made it so much easier to do.

1747
01:46:26,351 --> 01:46:31,351
And I was doing a talk not too long ago
and somebody told me afterwards that

1748
01:46:33,161 --> 01:46:36,370
something that I didn't even
realize. Um, I was, you know,

1749
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:38,040
how last time I was talking about,
uh,

1750
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:43,080
finding ideas and that we do that thing
called proof the lane and they told me

1751
01:46:43,690 --> 01:46:48,100
that they just kind of mentioned
to me that I kind of had continued.

1752
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:50,410
I did in the Marine Corps and I,

1753
01:46:50,490 --> 01:46:54,660
I did this thing called proofing the lane
where I was proving what, what I was,

1754
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:56,880
you know, stepping on the
ground and proving was cleared.

1755
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:01,140
And then they said that kind of that
I didn't realize that this is a time,

1756
01:47:01,141 --> 01:47:04,110
but they said that theme is
following you wherever you go.

1757
01:47:04,111 --> 01:47:07,260
So I'm now proofing the lane for these,

1758
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:11,670
these veterans that maybe struggling a
little bit trying to improving what's

1759
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:14,410
possible. And so, yeah,
I'm glad that they, uh,

1760
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:16,470
glad that they told me that because
that really makes a lot sense.

1761
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:19,340
That makes total sense. Then Dan
can Austin, who's a total stud,

1762
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:21,590
he's about to be in the parallel again.

1763
01:47:21,650 --> 01:47:26,150
Yeah. Again, he's going to up
Yon. Was it Xiang Wisconsin?

1764
01:47:26,540 --> 01:47:29,930
Yeah.
Pyong Chang a South Korea to a,

1765
01:47:29,931 --> 01:47:33,260
I think he's doing biathlon and uh,
the cross country skiing.

1766
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:36,460
Yeah. No, he's a total
beast, uh, seal, uh, that,

1767
01:47:36,461 --> 01:47:41,460
that also lost both of his legs above
the knee and just a total bad ass stud.

1768
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,073
Um,

1769
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:48,620
I want to read a couple more
little sections from your
journal to close this out

1770
01:47:51,060 --> 01:47:53,700
here. We go back to the journal.
So when I get asked by people,

1771
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:57,870
how could you fathom let alone complete
running 31 marathons in 31 days?

1772
01:47:57,871 --> 01:48:02,871
I give them the same simple answer because
I am a marine and my mission to fight

1773
01:48:04,801 --> 01:48:07,950
for my fellow veterans has not changed.

1774
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:11,850
And when a Marine is on
mission for his fellow marines,

1775
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,990
he is capable of anything.
Therefore, when people asked me,

1776
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:19,620
haven't you done enough,
sacrificed enough,

1777
01:48:20,670 --> 01:48:25,470
I remind them that not only do I have
the capability to accomplish my mission,

1778
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:28,050
be proud of my Marine Corps heritage,

1779
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:31,440
stay faithful to my fellow
marines and keep fighting.

1780
01:48:32,130 --> 01:48:34,080
I have the responsibility,

1781
01:48:34,860 --> 01:48:38,490
I have the responsibility to keep
fighting for my country, my core,

1782
01:48:38,790 --> 01:48:43,770
and my fellow veterans. So
no, it will never be enough.

1783
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:49,290
The day that I have done enough will be
the day that six marines lower my body

1784
01:48:49,291 --> 01:48:52,410
into my grave in Arlington Cemetery.

1785
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:55,410
And how can I do it?

1786
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:02,040
I do it because it is my duty
and to do my duty is my honor.

1787
01:49:08,950 --> 01:49:12,340
In one last little passage I
want to read from your journal,

1788
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:14,380
it says,

1789
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:19,300
I am merely a representative of
what is possible for any veteran,

1790
01:49:19,570 --> 01:49:23,950
any person.
So as time passes,

1791
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:26,470
I do not want my name to be remembered.

1792
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:32,640
All I want to be remembered is the story
years from now when people speak about

1793
01:49:35,011 --> 01:49:36,540
this,
I want them to say,

1794
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:41,580
I remember that guy who ran all those
marathons that one time and their friend

1795
01:49:41,581 --> 01:49:46,440
will, will reply, what was
his name? And they will say,

1796
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:47,740
I don't remember,

1797
01:49:49,370 --> 01:49:50,510
but he was a marine.

1798
01:49:58,110 --> 01:49:58,750
Well

1799
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:00,480
Rob, I can tell you that, uh,

1800
01:50:01,150 --> 01:50:05,050
I got a feeling that you
will be remembered and your
name will be remembered and

1801
01:50:05,051 --> 01:50:10,051
the way that you have represented the
marines and America and mankind will be

1802
01:50:12,371 --> 01:50:13,204
remembered

1803
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:19,480
and remembered and revered as well.
So

1804
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:26,230
thanks for coming on the show again and
letting us all know that we are capable

1805
01:50:29,180 --> 01:50:31,730
of much,
much more

1806
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:37,850
if we just step up and
push a little bit harder.

1807
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:39,733
Okay.

1808
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:45,640
Been awesome having you back on man. It's
been awesome being here. I mean, again,

1809
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:49,810
I'm glad I could come up
with, uh, the material.

1810
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:53,320
I was like, why don't you just say
you invited me back. I was like,

1811
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:54,170
I got our start writing.
So

1812
01:50:54,220 --> 01:50:56,730
stop. No, you don't have to. Right.

1813
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:02,470
You got any questions for the
man? Yeah, he, was there any time,

1814
01:51:02,471 --> 01:51:05,270
like during the 31 marathons that you
were like, oh, this is kind of lame

1815
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:11,140
gob kind of off this? No. Were you
ever, did you ever think that, I mean,

1816
01:51:11,141 --> 01:51:14,230
not even necessarily that you were
like tired physically or nothing,

1817
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:17,170
just kind of like, you know, it's kind of

1818
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:20,710
Tristan, we got, I got, I definitely got
tired of doing the interviews. Oh, okay.

1819
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:25,690
Yeah. Yeah. But the thing with
that is the interviews, you know,

1820
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:28,540
I didn't, I wasn't doing this to
like to get a bunch of, you know,

1821
01:51:28,570 --> 01:51:33,520
people telling me I'm awesome or
anything. Um, but the interviews,

1822
01:51:33,550 --> 01:51:38,550
so doing the marathons without the
interviews would be pointless because the

1823
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:40,930
story wouldn't get out there
without doing the interviews.

1824
01:51:41,240 --> 01:51:42,970
But doing the interviews
without the story,

1825
01:51:43,030 --> 01:51:47,230
without doing the marathons is actually
is also a point where I kind of got

1826
01:51:48,540 --> 01:51:50,080
there.
The funny thing is

1827
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:54,340
I did this because it
was going to be hard.

1828
01:51:54,550 --> 01:51:56,640
I did this because it'd be
really difficult. Yeah. Yeah.

1829
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:59,770
And I knew that going in and that's the
whole purpose of it is to do something

1830
01:51:59,771 --> 01:52:03,760
that was hard. And then, you know, the
last four days and then Houston and stuff,

1831
01:52:03,761 --> 01:52:06,010
when it started to get
hard, I was like, well shit,

1832
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:11,570
was it so hard?
But um,

1833
01:52:13,340 --> 01:52:14,173
okay.

1834
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:18,310
Yeah, I like I, like I was saying before,
there was never a point where I was like,

1835
01:52:18,311 --> 01:52:21,160
there's no way I can do this or
anything like that. I was like,

1836
01:52:21,280 --> 01:52:25,420
as long as I don't get
severely injured by a mistake,

1837
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:29,980
don't get hit by a car or you know,
break a bone or something,

1838
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,140
then I'm going to be able to do this.

1839
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:35,080
Yeah. Going to get her done.
Yeah. I feel like the air,

1840
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:37,630
like every once in a while when I
do something that takes a long time,

1841
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:39,040
like months or something like that,

1842
01:52:39,610 --> 01:52:42,580
I get to a point everyone every once
in a while and I'm like, what am,

1843
01:52:42,581 --> 01:52:43,480
what am I doing here?

1844
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:47,420
Yeah, it's definitely good. It
just, it gets repetitive for sure.

1845
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:52,810
Wake up a run the marathon. You don't
listen to music, you don't listen to,

1846
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,860
do you listen to podcasts?
Do you listen to music?

1847
01:52:55,790 --> 01:53:00,740
Did it really on the month of marathons?
Except a few times because

1848
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:05,180
I had people with me and be like, Hey, I'm
listening to a podcast. Leave me alone.

1849
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:07,700
You know, sometimes I didn't
do that to be honest with you.

1850
01:53:08,090 --> 01:53:13,050
There were times I did do that. Um,
sometimes that Wednesday morning,

1851
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:16,610
that Jocko podcast,
um,

1852
01:53:17,950 --> 01:53:19,090
you're hoping for a long one.

1853
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:21,640
One of the few people I was
hoping for a four hour podcast

1854
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:24,280
were,

1855
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:28,000
I felt kind of bad in the last four
because I told you my back was hurting so

1856
01:53:28,001 --> 01:53:31,510
much and it was like every time I land
on that right foot would be severe pain

1857
01:53:31,511 --> 01:53:34,330
and then I would kind of make me
like kind of gasp a little bit.

1858
01:53:35,290 --> 01:53:39,550
And so I felt really bad because there's
a lot of people that were, you know,

1859
01:53:39,551 --> 01:53:43,670
they came out to run with me and they
were like talking to me and trying to try

1860
01:53:43,671 --> 01:53:47,590
and help me keep going. But I just was
not in the mood for talking, you know?

1861
01:53:47,591 --> 01:53:50,140
And I felt terrible because they be like,
ask me questions.

1862
01:53:50,141 --> 01:53:53,480
I'd be like giving him the one word,
you know, like, Oh, you know, they,

1863
01:53:53,481 --> 01:53:57,230
but what's your favorite
place? Or whatever. I'm
like, oh, I don't know. Yeah.

1864
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:58,193
And it's,
I just,

1865
01:53:59,150 --> 01:54:04,060
so I wish I could have handled
that part a little bit better.

1866
01:54:04,061 --> 01:54:07,140
And you know, get let those people who
I talked to, those people who have it,

1867
01:54:07,141 --> 01:54:10,820
but I'm sure they understand why.
And I kind of said it before and I'm like,

1868
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:12,490
listen to everybody.
Yeah. If I'm not talking,

1869
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:16,270
if it's cause I have this back injury
and it's not because I don't like yes,

1870
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:21,220
because I hate you. Yeah.
So it's that. But you know,

1871
01:54:21,221 --> 01:54:26,050
when, when it got hard, uh, I fell
back on, on my mission and uh,

1872
01:54:26,051 --> 01:54:29,610
that's what, uh, that's what
I was doing it for. It didn't,

1873
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:34,360
whether or not I was hurting or didn't
feel like doing it was not as important.

1874
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:37,310
Anything to do with anything really.
Does it vary?

1875
01:54:38,090 --> 01:54:38,780
I ask you,

1876
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:43,780
I want to ask your opinion on something
cause I came up with a theory and it's

1877
01:54:44,831 --> 01:54:49,330
not totally thought out yet like this
and this theory might actually get me

1878
01:54:49,331 --> 01:54:52,360
killed. So please echo, uh, defend to me.

1879
01:54:54,490 --> 01:54:58,240
I think that there may be something
that's more powerful than discipline

1880
01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:01,310
and what

1881
01:55:03,640 --> 01:55:05,630
anybody that's listening
Jocko reached for the night.

1882
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:11,950
And, and maybe it's just that
they're kind of go hand in hand.

1883
01:55:11,980 --> 01:55:16,010
But I think the one thing that may be as
powerful or maybe even more power from

1884
01:55:16,011 --> 01:55:19,570
the discipline is a selflessness.

1885
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:24,160
And so the reason I say that is because,

1886
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,050
I don't know,

1887
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:33,660
maybe the discipline leads to the
ability to perform the selfless act.

1888
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:35,860
But it seems to me like

1889
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:42,630
all the discipline in the world might
not allow you to do something like lift a

1890
01:55:42,870 --> 01:55:43,703
car

1891
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:49,360
off of your child, you know, r
or dive on a grenade. Well, yeah,

1892
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:53,100
I mean there's, I think you're actually
100% right on. That's a theory.

1893
01:55:53,101 --> 01:55:56,810
I think that, you know, when you
take guys in combat, we, when,

1894
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:00,930
when guys are in combat and
guys do incredible things
and sacrifice their lives

1895
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:04,860
for their brothers, that that is not
about discipline and the, you know,

1896
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:08,340
they're doing that because
they're selfless and they
want to take care of their

1897
01:56:08,341 --> 01:56:11,550
friends. That's what they're
doing it for. And you know,

1898
01:56:11,551 --> 01:56:13,900
there can be people that are,
you know,

1899
01:56:13,980 --> 01:56:18,980
undisciplined individuals that perform
incredibly heroic things in combat.

1900
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:24,420
So, no, I don't think, I don't
think it's a, I don't think it's a,

1901
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:27,450
I think that's actually correct.
I mean, I think there's,

1902
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:31,200
that's an extremely powerful
force. And, and you know,

1903
01:56:31,260 --> 01:56:34,830
that may be the end.
And I was thinking about,

1904
01:56:36,270 --> 01:56:37,103
you know,

1905
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:40,200
the power of that where I thought you
were going to say when I thought you were

1906
01:56:40,201 --> 01:56:44,010
going to talk about it was you know, you
weren't doing this for yourself, right?

1907
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,680
You know,
you weren't doing this for yourself.

1908
01:56:46,681 --> 01:56:50,310
You are doing this to get a message out
there that you're doing this to raise

1909
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:53,700
money for others, for your friends,
for you to brothers. That's,

1910
01:56:54,030 --> 01:56:57,150
that is a more powerful thing than,
hey,

1911
01:56:57,151 --> 01:57:00,670
I'm just a self disciplined person right
now. You know, discipline is, is like a,

1912
01:57:00,671 --> 01:57:03,630
it's like there, it's like
they're, they're indifferent. Um,

1913
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:06,210
it's not apples to apples. I
don't think. It's not like,

1914
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:08,610
it's not like this is more
powerful than that. No,

1915
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:13,940
because I'll tell you that
if you want to perform well,

1916
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,840
if you want to achieve things,

1917
01:57:15,841 --> 01:57:19,050
like you wouldn't be able
to do this for these causes.

1918
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:21,960
If you didn't have the
discipline to train, hard to
eat, right, to get on the path,

1919
01:57:21,961 --> 01:57:22,794
to stay on the path,

1920
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,680
you wouldn't have been able to do
this even though you really wanted to,

1921
01:57:26,010 --> 01:57:28,500
even though you really,
really wanted to, you really,

1922
01:57:28,501 --> 01:57:30,090
really wanted to care about your brothers.
You really,

1923
01:57:30,091 --> 01:57:33,570
really wanted to raise money for those
funds if you have the discipline to make

1924
01:57:33,571 --> 01:57:36,490
it happen and,
and train yourself and be ready that,

1925
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:39,060
that you wouldn't have been able to
deliver that just like a guy on the

1926
01:57:39,061 --> 01:57:43,290
battlefield there on the
battlefield because they,
they were able to perform the,

1927
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:47,760
were able to have the discipline to get
to that point. Uh, but there, there too,

1928
01:57:47,761 --> 01:57:49,400
I'd say they're related.
I don't think they're,

1929
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:51,800
they're definitely not
opposing each other. And I,

1930
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:56,460
and in fact I think that if
I was to tell you, you know,

1931
01:57:56,461 --> 01:57:59,640
when I was in the seal teams w the dry,

1932
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:03,960
the actual driving force
behind the discipline that,

1933
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:07,500
that I tried to have myself wasn't for me.

1934
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:10,920
It was like I want to be able to
perform well on the battlefield,

1935
01:58:10,921 --> 01:58:12,270
not because I want to perform well,

1936
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:14,010
but because I want to make sure
I don't let my brothers down.

1937
01:58:14,430 --> 01:58:19,430
So I would say it's actually like a
force that's a foundational force.

1938
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:24,450
You know, it's like people that
are heavily, heavily religious,

1939
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:27,540
their discipline relies
on their religious faith.

1940
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:31,340
People that are overachievers,

1941
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:34,710
that want to accomplish something that
their discipline is based on the fact

1942
01:58:34,711 --> 01:58:38,910
that they want to get that achievement.
So the discipline by itself,

1943
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,250
there has to be that the discipline,

1944
01:58:42,251 --> 01:58:44,680
there has to be a foundation that that's
built upon it. And I think a lot of,

1945
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,250
a lot of times people build their,
their foundation of discipline,

1946
01:58:48,370 --> 01:58:52,300
the foundation that their discipline is
built on is actually the fact that they

1947
01:58:52,301 --> 01:58:54,070
want to take care of their friends.

1948
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:55,420
They want to be able to
take care of their brothers.

1949
01:58:55,421 --> 01:58:58,840
I want to take care of their family. You
know, you get all kinds of, you know,

1950
01:58:58,841 --> 01:59:03,340
I was, you take a a single mom
that's working three jobs right now.

1951
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:07,660
Well, she's has to be highly disciplined.
She has to be highly disciplined.

1952
01:59:07,661 --> 01:59:10,090
She's got to get up every morning at
three o'clock to get to the diner and time

1953
01:59:10,091 --> 01:59:14,380
to start waiting tables. She's
doing that. She has that discipline,

1954
01:59:14,620 --> 01:59:18,220
not based on the fact that she
wants to be stronger for herself.

1955
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:20,890
She's doing that so she can feed her kids.
She's doing that.

1956
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:25,270
She's doing that selflessly so that she
can feed her kids. So no, I mean that's,

1957
01:59:25,271 --> 01:59:30,080
uh, that's absolutely true. And
I totally agree. Warning. Yeah.

1958
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:34,240
Supporting, uh, yeah. I
think the, the best way,

1959
01:59:34,241 --> 01:59:36,190
the way to get the most
out of yourself as a,

1960
01:59:36,191 --> 01:59:39,010
figure out a way to make it about
something that you care about more than

1961
01:59:39,011 --> 01:59:40,620
yourself. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1962
01:59:40,621 --> 01:59:44,050
I think that discipline
is a manifestation of,

1963
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:48,130
of selflessness in many ways. It's
a way that you're, like I said,

1964
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:52,510
a single mom that's working
three jobs. Look, let's face it.

1965
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:54,670
She doesn't want to work
any of those three jobs.

1966
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:57,640
She doesn't want to work any of
those three jobs. But she's doing it.

1967
01:59:57,641 --> 02:00:01,000
She's doing it every day, day in, day out,
day out. Why you should do in that she,

1968
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:04,810
why is she dismissed
showing that discipline and
manifesting that discipline.

1969
02:00:04,990 --> 02:00:07,990
It's because she cares about her kids
more than she cares about herself.

1970
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:09,160
And that's all there is to it.

1971
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:12,520
And you could go to the battlefield and
say the same thing. Well why do, why do,

1972
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:16,870
why do marines train so hard? Why do,
why do we train hard in the seal teams?

1973
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:19,960
Why are we doing that? Oh,
we doing that for ourselves.

1974
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:22,930
Are we imposing that discipline ourselves?
Are we having the self discipline?

1975
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:26,500
Because we want to be good for ourselves.
No,

1976
02:00:26,560 --> 02:00:28,270
it's because we want to be able
to take care of our friends.

1977
02:00:28,271 --> 02:00:29,650
We want to be ale to take
care of our brothers.

1978
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:33,370
And you could go across the
board with any of that. So I,

1979
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:37,740
I totally agree with you. Awesome.
Long, glad I'm still alive. No

1980
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:40,773
Shit.

1981
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:45,990
Could they at any point come into
conflict with each other where you got to

1982
02:00:46,271 --> 02:00:50,970
choose to remain disciplined
or serve others? I don't.

1983
02:00:50,971 --> 02:00:53,860
I don't see how they would
come in conflict with each
other and if they did come

1984
02:00:53,861 --> 02:00:58,510
in conflict, I think you make a rational
decision, you know, like, I mean,

1985
02:00:58,540 --> 02:01:03,160
I mean, Hey, am I going to
get sneak my workout in?

1986
02:01:03,220 --> 02:01:05,370
Like what's more important
to me working out or,

1987
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:10,210
or going on a mission with my
friends. Right, right. Or your,

1988
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:13,780
I dunno daughters piano recital
that they want you to be at,

1989
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:15,660
but you gotta you know,
it's like you got it.

1990
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:19,300
You got to choose between what and what
being disciplined with a workout that

1991
02:01:19,301 --> 02:01:23,680
day. Okay. I be making the recital. I mean
obviously you want to make the recital,

1992
02:01:23,710 --> 02:01:24,700
but if the,

1993
02:01:24,820 --> 02:01:28,270
if the choice was between making the
recital and you have to go to your job and

1994
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:31,210
work well, if you don't go to
your job and work, guess what?

1995
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:35,270
Now you don't have money to pay for
your piano lessons in the first place to

1996
02:01:35,480 --> 02:01:40,220
think about that, that all I'm
saying that this is a situation where

1997
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:43,580
it discipline and selflessness
will come into conflict.

1998
02:01:43,581 --> 02:01:44,660
I'm just saying usually they're,

1999
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:46,460
they support each other and
for sure I think you're right.

2000
02:01:46,461 --> 02:01:49,250
But is there a circumstance
where you're saying there is,

2001
02:01:49,460 --> 02:01:53,660
you could actually become,
you could actually focus on
yourself and be like, hey,

2002
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:56,160
it's more important for me
to take care of me, right.

2003
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:00,320
Than it is for me to take care of my
team and that's not going to go over well

2004
02:02:00,321 --> 02:02:05,030
with the team and we may end up being,
you know, a highly disciplined individual,

2005
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:06,980
right. You, you have no,

2006
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:10,970
you have no outlet for it because you
have no one to take care of it except for

2007
02:02:10,971 --> 02:02:13,910
yourself. And that's the thing, like
you see like the what's, what's the, uh,

2008
02:02:15,110 --> 02:02:18,200
I haven't watched the movie, but
I know exactly. No, I'm serious.

2009
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:21,290
I haven't watched the movie.
It's American psycho, right? No,

2010
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:24,380
I haven't watched the movie,
but I know exactly what the story is.

2011
02:02:24,381 --> 02:02:26,870
The guy is like super highly disciplined.
Right?

2012
02:02:27,390 --> 02:02:29,570
Isn't he like the way he does everything.
Highly disciplined,

2013
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:32,300
but at the same time,
obviously he's a psycho and he's,

2014
02:02:32,390 --> 02:02:34,910
he's not supporting anyone but himself.
Sure.

2015
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,910
So that's like an extreme version of
someone that cares about themselves. Yeah.

2016
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,800
The sure they're highly disciplined,
but you know,

2017
02:02:42,860 --> 02:02:45,680
being highly disciplined doesn't
make you a good person. Yeah.

2018
02:02:45,681 --> 02:02:48,680
It doesn't automatically
make you it. Well, yeah,

2019
02:02:48,681 --> 02:02:51,230
it doesn't make you selfless and it
certainly doesn't make you a good person

2020
02:02:51,231 --> 02:02:55,630
either. And you could certainly get
into a situation where, you know,

2021
02:02:55,631 --> 02:02:59,870
you get people that are a bank
robbers. No, I was highly disciplined.

2022
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,540
Bank robber. I wasn't thinking
bank robbers. But you think,

2023
02:03:03,890 --> 02:03:07,950
you know the people that are so into
working out that that trumps, yeah.

2024
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:12,590
Family trumps everything and they,
and they have an issue, right.

2025
02:03:12,710 --> 02:03:16,940
They're so into it that they, that
they sacrifice, not even sacrifice.

2026
02:03:16,941 --> 02:03:20,420
They just don't care.
It's a w w you know,

2027
02:03:20,421 --> 02:03:23,660
when you meet someone that's so
into working out that, I mean,

2028
02:03:23,661 --> 02:03:26,810
that's a very selfish thing,
right.

2029
02:03:26,811 --> 02:03:29,030
Working out as a selfish thing right now.

2030
02:03:29,060 --> 02:03:33,020
There's part of it that selfless because
you're working out so that you can stay

2031
02:03:33,021 --> 02:03:35,000
healthy so you can take care of your
family, you can take care of front.

2032
02:03:35,001 --> 02:03:37,490
It's like we just talked about.
You can take that to a point. Yeah.

2033
02:03:37,491 --> 02:03:41,660
So you're capable of surviving and
taking care of your life, your friends,

2034
02:03:41,661 --> 02:03:45,230
your family. But you can easily
get to a point where, hey,

2035
02:03:45,231 --> 02:03:47,900
the most important thing
is me. Yeah. My pull up,

2036
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:50,570
the most important thing is me and
my, my numbers. Yeah. My numbers.

2037
02:03:50,810 --> 02:03:51,410
And you know what,

2038
02:03:51,410 --> 02:03:55,580
I was danger close to this with
Jujitsu cause for awhile I was like,

2039
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:59,750
I'd come home at night and my and my
wife would be like, you know, this is,

2040
02:03:59,751 --> 02:04:04,100
I was still in the teams and I was,
that was a task unit commander. Like we,

2041
02:04:04,130 --> 02:04:06,650
I was the, that was the most
important thing in my life.

2042
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:09,980
But I would still come home at night at
seven 30 at night or eight o'clock at

2043
02:04:09,981 --> 02:04:13,250
night and I'd grab my gym bag and I'd
go train Jiu Jitsu and my wife would be

2044
02:04:13,251 --> 02:04:16,220
like, what the Hell is wrong with
you? It's like what are you doing?

2045
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,450
And that's, that was borderline,
right? That was borderline.

2046
02:04:20,690 --> 02:04:23,660
But for me it was like,
Hey,

2047
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:28,520
this is a skillset that I should have
when I'm on a battlefield so I can take

2048
02:04:28,521 --> 02:04:30,680
care of myself and take care
of my friends. And by the way,

2049
02:04:30,681 --> 02:04:35,681
that means I have a 1.001% chance that
I'm going to come home instead of not

2050
02:04:36,561 --> 02:04:37,830
come home.
So I'm going to do it.

2051
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:39,870
And that right there,

2052
02:04:39,871 --> 02:04:42,630
that's probably a little bit of
raw rationalization cause cause,

2053
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:46,120
cause selfish the, I really love training
Jujitsu. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So there's,

2054
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:47,280
there's a selfishness there.

2055
02:04:47,281 --> 02:04:51,330
And I then I just tried to rationalize
a little bit and, and you know,

2056
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:52,703
another thing we talked,

2057
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:56,200
we talked about the first podcast with
you is rationalization and how you've got

2058
02:04:56,201 --> 02:05:00,390
to be careful of that. You
gotta be careful of rational
rationalizing everything.

2059
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:03,180
So yeah, those are,
those are things that uh,

2060
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:08,490
definitely can get, can become,
can become problematic if you,

2061
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:12,630
if, well, that's, you know what,
that's why there's a dichotomy.

2062
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:16,260
That's why there's a dichotomy and
everything cause you can go overboard with

2063
02:05:16,290 --> 02:05:17,123
any,

2064
02:05:17,700 --> 02:05:22,560
any personality trait you
can go too far with and the,

2065
02:05:22,561 --> 02:05:25,430
you can definitely go that. That's
why I discipline and freedom. It's,

2066
02:05:25,431 --> 02:05:29,640
it's actually a balance. Even though
discipline equals freedom. But guess what?

2067
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:33,420
If you have pure discipline,
if you remove all freedom,

2068
02:05:33,450 --> 02:05:38,280
well then what did you just do in
sleeve? Yeah, you enslaved so you,

2069
02:05:38,340 --> 02:05:42,690
there's balance, there's
balance in, in discipline.

2070
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:43,950
There has to be balanced in discipline.

2071
02:05:44,340 --> 02:05:47,280
I think the reason that it strikes
people to talk about discipline equals

2072
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:49,470
freedom is because most people
don't make that connection.

2073
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:53,970
And most people lean so far towards
just freedom of doing whatever they want

2074
02:05:53,971 --> 02:05:58,470
that they ended up in, slaved from a
different direction, which is equally,

2075
02:05:58,471 --> 02:05:59,850
if not more problematic.

2076
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:03,900
And I say more problematic because now
you're in a situation where you're slaves,

2077
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:07,470
you're enslaved by something that's
not good. That's not healthy,

2078
02:06:07,471 --> 02:06:10,200
that's not positive.
Whereas at least with discipline,

2079
02:06:10,201 --> 02:06:13,020
if you're s imposing the discipline
on yourself, self-discipline,

2080
02:06:13,310 --> 02:06:14,190
well then you're,

2081
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:19,560
you're imposing things on you that or at
least positive long term, at a minimum,

2082
02:06:19,561 --> 02:06:23,880
they're positive long term. Yeah. Yeah.
Now, can you go overboard with that? Yes.

2083
02:06:23,940 --> 02:06:25,800
There's people that have eating disorders,
right?

2084
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:28,170
There's people that have eating disorders.
They,

2085
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:33,200
they impose such strict discipline
that they're unhealthy and that's bad.

2086
02:06:34,050 --> 02:06:35,880
And that's horrible. You know, I've, I've,

2087
02:06:35,970 --> 02:06:40,740
I've heard back from some people
that that said, hey, you know,

2088
02:06:40,741 --> 02:06:42,570
I have trouble with eating disorders.
You know,

2089
02:06:42,571 --> 02:06:47,571
it's generally been females who have
more trouble with that category and they

2090
02:06:48,061 --> 02:06:52,350
actually have to use the
discipline to say the Dick Correct.

2091
02:06:52,351 --> 02:06:54,870
Discipline thing to do is to eat more,

2092
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:58,290
is to eat the proper amount of calories
because it's a horrible, horrible thing.

2093
02:06:58,291 --> 02:07:02,550
If you see people going through that
and it's a fatal disease, right?

2094
02:07:02,730 --> 02:07:06,810
It's a fatal disease. And so, so
again, to your point, there's,

2095
02:07:06,840 --> 02:07:10,860
you can become so disciplined that it's,
that it's negative,

2096
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:14,430
it's negative on your personal health.
It's negative on your, you know,

2097
02:07:14,431 --> 02:07:17,310
you can work yourself,
you can work yourself so hard,

2098
02:07:17,790 --> 02:07:20,640
you can say I'm going to be disciplined
at work and now you, you stop,

2099
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:24,270
you lose the balance and you start
stop working out and you stop training.

2100
02:07:24,271 --> 02:07:27,900
You start eating donuts and
you start eating donuts.

2101
02:07:27,901 --> 02:07:30,030
Not before you run a marathon,

2102
02:07:30,031 --> 02:07:33,940
but before you sit down in your
front of your computer. So they're,

2103
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:35,890
there absolutely has to be balanced.
But

2104
02:07:37,030 --> 02:07:40,390
factually the,

2105
02:07:41,980 --> 02:07:46,150
the tendency,
the tendency is I'm going to be,

2106
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:48,660
I'm going to be less disciplined
and when to do things that are easy,

2107
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:51,330
I'm and been the easy path.
And that leads to, that's,

2108
02:07:51,340 --> 02:07:54,220
that's the 80% 90% I
don't know what percent,

2109
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:56,290
but that is a vast majority of people.

2110
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:59,410
Vast majority of people don't need
less discipline in their lives.

2111
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:03,010
They need more discipline. That's the
vast majority of people, myself included,

2112
02:08:03,640 --> 02:08:05,890
myself and good need more
discipline, not less. Yeah.

2113
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:09,630
And it's almost about what you're being
disciplined towards. So like in the,

2114
02:08:10,990 --> 02:08:12,820
the situation,
bring up with a recital,

2115
02:08:14,140 --> 02:08:16,440
you have the competing thing.

2116
02:08:16,450 --> 02:08:21,450
So maybe it actually takes more discipline
to forgo your workout and realize,

2117
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:27,250
oh yeah, bigger picture kind of thing.
People will say to me, like on a,

2118
02:08:27,370 --> 02:08:31,060
on Twitter, they'll say, if
you have real discipline,

2119
02:08:31,061 --> 02:08:33,070
once you have the discipline
to sleep in tomorrow,

2120
02:08:34,890 --> 02:08:39,090
10 get out of your comfort
zone and sleep in. But yes,

2121
02:08:39,091 --> 02:08:43,450
so you'd have to look at the bigger, is
there a bigger discipline then? Right,

2122
02:08:43,451 --> 02:08:46,570
because you gotta you gotta you gotta
consider your goals and stuff like that.

2123
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:50,470
You can't have the discipline to sleep
in if that doesn't benefit your goal.

2124
02:08:50,650 --> 02:08:50,950
Right.

2125
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:54,880
It's not even discipline and like the
person that's struggling with the eating

2126
02:08:54,881 --> 02:08:58,300
disorder, they're discipline. At first
they were disciplined to lose weight.

2127
02:08:58,750 --> 02:09:02,740
I need to change that discipline to be a
healthy. Right. Consider the goal. Yeah.

2128
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,220
The goal. The goal needs to change
the goal. What a scary thing.

2129
02:09:06,750 --> 02:09:09,140
It's a scary thing. You look in
the mirror and you, you, you,

2130
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,960
you think you're
overweight and you're not.

2131
02:09:11,050 --> 02:09:15,070
Some guys get that the opposite for sure.
The body, this body body Dysmorphia,

2132
02:09:15,071 --> 02:09:18,080
morphine, is that what it's called?
Yeah. So you can have it like you know,

2133
02:09:18,100 --> 02:09:21,100
you think you're always, you always
think you're fat, but you're skinny.

2134
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:24,130
And then the other way is like you always
think you're skinny so you need bigger

2135
02:09:24,131 --> 02:09:27,930
muscles. So you see that you get
on the juice. Yeah, whatever. Yeah.

2136
02:09:28,200 --> 02:09:32,830
Asteroids and that's what actually
why we're getting the Echo Jocko.

2137
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:37,010
We'd like listening or we talked
about this earlier, too much muscles.

2138
02:09:37,630 --> 02:09:41,630
Your muscles are so supportive, man.

2139
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:43,840
Juicing and before we
started cutting weight

2140
02:09:48,190 --> 02:09:48,670
shit,

2141
02:09:48,670 --> 02:09:53,670
speaking of health and support
and support Echo Charles,

2142
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:58,660
is there any way that you
could advise us how to support

2143
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:04,570
ourselves, ourselves and each other
and possibly we just support you.

2144
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,930
Support we support,
we support.

2145
02:10:08,650 --> 02:10:12,900
We did actually one of the benefits of
having you on as you're very supportive,

2146
02:10:13,060 --> 02:10:16,360
that encouraging, you
know, and I like that.

2147
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,090
But in the event of people,

2148
02:10:19,150 --> 02:10:24,150
US wanting to support this podcast in
addition to each other in addition to

2149
02:10:24,791 --> 02:10:27,070
ourselves or all at once,

2150
02:10:27,071 --> 02:10:31,360
we can stay on Jocko Super Krill oil.

2151
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,960
I thought I going to say the path or

2152
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:37,610
the path. That's bigger picture for
sure. And we'll talk about that.

2153
02:10:37,970 --> 02:10:41,840
But one of the methods to
stay on the path is Krill oil.

2154
02:10:41,841 --> 02:10:45,170
You can lift a lot of weight to get
strong muscles. Kind of like, um,

2155
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:49,580
like when you tear your skin
apart I guess. But if your
joints are all jacked up,

2156
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:52,430
they don't want to move,
you're not lifting nothing. So,

2157
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:55,970
and this goes for everyday life. So
Super Krill oil, Jocko has supplements.

2158
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:58,340
Finally,
super crew oil,

2159
02:10:58,460 --> 02:11:02,690
joint warfare and discipline,
which is a pre mission.

2160
02:11:02,691 --> 02:11:05,060
When he cognitive
enhancer force multiplier.

2161
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:10,880
Technically what is force multiplier mean
is like when you get one thing Jen and

2162
02:11:10,881 --> 02:11:13,310
other and the sum is worth more than the,

2163
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:17,600
than the parts kind of yet cognitive,
you're so excited about that.

2164
02:11:17,601 --> 02:11:21,320
I'm just going to let it roll
anyway. Three supplements, right?

2165
02:11:21,650 --> 02:11:24,350
Not counting the new one
that's going to come out soon.

2166
02:11:24,590 --> 02:11:25,940
So krill oil for your joints.

2167
02:11:25,941 --> 02:11:30,470
Joint warfare for fair for your
joints and discipline. Pre mission.

2168
02:11:30,500 --> 02:11:33,650
You take it, cognitive enhancers,
little bit of caffeine in there,

2169
02:11:34,060 --> 02:11:38,930
puts 15 milligrams unless you
drink multiple scoop. Sure.

2170
02:11:38,931 --> 02:11:43,931
Then it's 30 did an event the other
night and I was kinda tired going into it

2171
02:11:43,971 --> 02:11:47,540
straight up. I was kind of tired and,
and usually my events are during the day,

2172
02:11:47,630 --> 02:11:50,300
but this was at night as I
was kind of like, you know,

2173
02:11:50,301 --> 02:11:52,250
I had flown out there and I
was feeling a little bit site,

2174
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:57,230
so I drank some discipline and then I
drank some more discipline and I ended up

2175
02:11:57,231 --> 02:11:58,430
having,
uh,

2176
02:11:58,550 --> 02:12:02,950
I guess it was a total sum total of
about five scoops of disciplines.

2177
02:12:03,670 --> 02:12:07,220
Sure. Too much discipline
in this guy, 60 milligrams,

2178
02:12:07,250 --> 02:12:10,130
but there's not just the
ballot. Yeah. But anyways,

2179
02:12:10,340 --> 02:12:13,750
I got done with the event and Gwen up to,
you know,

2180
02:12:13,970 --> 02:12:17,870
hung out with everyone for a little bit
added little dinner thing and then got

2181
02:12:17,871 --> 02:12:21,500
done with that and then hung out and
then went up to my room hotel room.

2182
02:12:21,950 --> 02:12:24,040
And I just sat there like PTF.

2183
02:12:26,050 --> 02:12:29,000
And the funny thing is I didn't
realize, I was like, why?

2184
02:12:29,060 --> 02:12:31,160
Cause I had gotten up early in the
morning. I worked out the travel,

2185
02:12:31,161 --> 02:12:34,520
the Bumblebee and I didn't realize why
am I, why do I have energy right now?

2186
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:36,650
Why can't I sleep right now? This
is ridiculous. What's wrong with me?

2187
02:12:36,830 --> 02:12:40,200
What's wrong with me? What's wrong with
it? What's wrong with me? And then,

2188
02:12:40,480 --> 02:12:43,070
and then I didn't even
realize it until the next day,

2189
02:12:43,150 --> 02:12:45,260
cause I went to bed at
one 30 in the morning,

2190
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:49,880
woke up at four 30 and then I
did like a stretch, came home,

2191
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:54,020
Jack Steele. When I got home,
of course I got home, did score,

2192
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:59,390
which is nice cause my arm's been
jacked up so I haven't been able to do,

2193
02:12:59,600 --> 02:13:03,560
I still, I'm not doing overhead
squats right now or even front squats.

2194
02:13:04,870 --> 02:13:07,530
I am doing front squats with a Kettlebell.
Yeah.

2195
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:12,260
Just have a bigger kettlebell
than other people, but whatever.

2196
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,170
Sure. So you gotta be
careful. Don't have the,

2197
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:18,170
if you're not used to caffeine,

2198
02:13:18,171 --> 02:13:20,960
because I'm not used to caffeine
because I only have Jocko white tea,

2199
02:13:20,961 --> 02:13:25,100
which has the same 15
milligrams or discipline.

2200
02:13:25,130 --> 02:13:26,390
If you're not used to caffeine,

2201
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:28,970
that little 15 milligrams and you drink
a bunch of it, you're going to feel it.

2202
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,680
Don't drink it before you go to bed
at night. Yeah. That's my warning.

2203
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,580
Unless you have stuff to do and let's get
stuff to do. Yeah, yeah. Get after it.

2204
02:13:35,630 --> 02:13:39,900
Yeah. Yeah. You want to balance the
discipline for sure. Yeah. You will not.

2205
02:13:39,901 --> 02:13:43,710
You will feel sharp. That's what's
good about it. You feel sharp. Good.

2206
02:13:44,010 --> 02:13:47,350
It's funny as and mentally when
you, or when someone says, boy,

2207
02:13:47,351 --> 02:13:52,350
I'm drinking the discipline you ever
watched? Spaceballs peaceful. I want,

2208
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:54,480
he's like liquid shorts.
I can't remember.

2209
02:13:55,160 --> 02:14:00,150
It's like the shorts is the force
liquid force he spells is right. Yeah.

2210
02:14:00,151 --> 02:14:04,370
It was a parody of star wars. The
force. It's this shorts, right?

2211
02:14:04,450 --> 02:14:07,200
Just put it was shorts and
then he had the liquid Schwartz

2212
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:11,280
or saw, I forget. Anyway,

2213
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:13,900
that's how you sound when you say I'm
drinking the discipline. You can't drink.

2214
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:18,090
You know? You see what I'm saying? Yeah.
I think you meant to do that. Nonetheless.

2215
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:22,800
You get this@originmain.com
on the top it says,

2216
02:14:22,801 --> 02:14:26,040
labs actually emailed me. He
was like, Hey, I can't find the,

2217
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:30,240
I can't find the discipline. I said,
look within yourself, Dan. I said,

2218
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:35,550
the origin may not come on the top.
It says labs made like, you know,

2219
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:39,900
I'm jumping back and forth. Anyway, that's
where you get it or didn't mean.com.

2220
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:45,750
I'm also an origin main.com they've got
some cool geese all made in America.

2221
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:51,180
Rash guards, compression gear tops
and bottoms. Rash guards, spats,

2222
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:56,240
spats, spats. Do they have the black
out yet? I don't have to do all right.

2223
02:14:56,340 --> 02:15:01,050
You know, also look at the start
planning your schedule for the origin,

2224
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:05,460
Jujitsu camp immersion. Immersion
camp. Yeah. It's not like,

2225
02:15:05,790 --> 02:15:09,150
it's not like a hardcore, like that's
the thing and that's what Pete kind of,

2226
02:15:09,151 --> 02:15:12,060
what world is what he was kind of
telling me where it's not like,

2227
02:15:12,330 --> 02:15:16,140
it's not like like boot camp or something.
Which would be cool too.

2228
02:15:16,140 --> 02:15:19,530
It's not like a training camp for like
an event. You know what I'm saying?

2229
02:15:19,531 --> 02:15:23,400
Like you don't want guys, yeah, yeah.
We're training. We're training hard,

2230
02:15:23,401 --> 02:15:26,070
but it's more like you're in there
to immerse yourself in Jujitsu.

2231
02:15:26,071 --> 02:15:29,190
You want to train hard, you train hard,
you want to learn hard. Yeah. Well, yeah.

2232
02:15:29,200 --> 02:15:31,720
The case in point, there's a lot of people
that have never even trained before.

2233
02:15:31,721 --> 02:15:35,130
They literally have never trained
before. Got Up and said, hey,

2234
02:15:35,131 --> 02:15:39,190
before this morning's class,
I need to get a g g,

2235
02:15:39,690 --> 02:15:41,760
you know? So yeah, that's an August.

2236
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:43,410
You can check on the website
for that to come on up.

2237
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:47,790
Echo Charles and I will be there. You
want to go? Yeah. Okay, cool. Come on.

2238
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:49,270
It's like this cool cat.
Yeah,

2239
02:15:49,740 --> 02:15:52,530
you can start learning more than I taught
you last time we did. You did, sir.

2240
02:15:56,550 --> 02:16:00,210
I have Jiu Jitsu legs now. Oh you
do? What are they looking at you?

2241
02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:05,360
Because I told you you got to
get rid of like the hard thing.

2242
02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:09,860
Yeah. They were just that hard
sockets. Right. And so what I did was,

2243
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:14,990
you know, had I had trouble standing up.
Yeah. So what I did was I had these two,

2244
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:17,540
I have the sockets and go on my legs.

2245
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:22,100
So what I had my process do its cover
them and foam and then so that's a little

2246
02:16:22,101 --> 02:16:24,110
bit softer for people.
So I don't hurt anybody.

2247
02:16:24,560 --> 02:16:29,090
And then he made it so I could just
stand on the ends of those sockets,

2248
02:16:29,220 --> 02:16:32,720
like the same height, the same height.
Awesome. And so now I have to kind of,

2249
02:16:33,150 --> 02:16:38,040
I use them to you. Uh, I haven't
started taking Jujitsu, uh,

2250
02:16:38,080 --> 02:16:41,770
cause I've been really busy. But uh,
I'm going to, I think once we get back,

2251
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:43,960
my wife and I are going to start going in.
Awesome.

2252
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:47,290
And then I also use them to
do some weightlifting stuff.

2253
02:16:47,291 --> 02:16:50,440
I've been able to figure out how
to do squats off the ground squats

2254
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:56,980
and uh, yeah. So it's
awesome. So I'll be ready.

2255
02:16:57,170 --> 02:16:58,960
Yeah, no that, that is awesome. Yeah.

2256
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:02,280
Cause the biggest concern
I had last time was the uh,

2257
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:07,300
the shell had like a Leica and
metal valve and that thing was on.

2258
02:17:07,301 --> 02:17:07,730
Cool.

2259
02:17:07,730 --> 02:17:08,800
Oh yeah.
Jeremy,

2260
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:15,040
I didn't realize at the time that you
were insulting me because that's how I do

2261
02:17:15,320 --> 02:17:17,910
not, no, not until after, uh,

2262
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:22,430
cause the whole time you were after
we rolled, you were like, oh yeah,

2263
02:17:22,431 --> 02:17:24,920
you're really strong, really strong.
And then a couple of times later,

2264
02:17:25,240 --> 02:17:29,700
it's a couple of podcasts
later, you're like, oh, it's
actually an insult. It's the,

2265
02:17:29,701 --> 02:17:32,670
yeah, you don't have any technique,
but you're strong. You know,

2266
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:37,450
I learned that was almost optimistic
to a fault was that when we roll,

2267
02:17:37,451 --> 02:17:39,290
and you've talked about this
before, when we roll, I was like,

2268
02:17:39,320 --> 02:17:41,660
there's gotta be a way
that I can catch Jocko.

2269
02:17:42,150 --> 02:17:44,940
There's gotta be some way in
that guy who was the guy, uh,

2270
02:17:45,030 --> 02:17:48,470
that's missing his hand that we rolled
with. I rolled with afterwards. Yeah.

2271
02:17:48,500 --> 02:17:53,150
Jeffrey. I had him in, I had him by
the neck and I was like, Oh Dang.

2272
02:17:53,151 --> 02:17:56,600
I got him. I can't believe I was like,
got him. And then afterwards he's like,

2273
02:17:56,601 --> 02:17:57,530
there's no possible way

2274
02:17:59,770 --> 02:18:03,140
somehow is this still optimistic
about what I can do to a fault?

2275
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,440
Is that, and you're the, uh,
you're with so many people,

2276
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:11,880
majority of people, especially in the
fall, in that category of like, well,

2277
02:18:11,970 --> 02:18:15,480
and the other funny thing is you'll get
somebody with something and then they

2278
02:18:15,481 --> 02:18:18,210
think to themselves, if I could,
if I just stopped that. Yeah,

2279
02:18:18,380 --> 02:18:21,330
they don't want to be able to,
when I had a, I had a wrestler,

2280
02:18:21,360 --> 02:18:24,080
this was back in the day,
I was like a blue belt and,

2281
02:18:25,500 --> 02:18:30,260
and this blue belt and I was going against
this wrestler, uh, you know, like a,

2282
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:35,280
a really good college wrestler and the
look on his face every single time was

2283
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,920
just, okay, let's, let's
go, let's go again.

2284
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:42,510
He was the first person that I realized
that that's the normal reaction.

2285
02:18:42,630 --> 02:18:46,260
But especially for a wrestler because
rest of that wrestling college man,

2286
02:18:46,261 --> 02:18:47,670
they've been dominating
people in high school.

2287
02:18:47,671 --> 02:18:49,890
They'd been dominating people in College.
They know,

2288
02:18:50,010 --> 02:18:54,720
they understand grappling and so when
they get, they get like submitted,

2289
02:18:54,960 --> 02:18:56,970
they just can't,
they just don't even understand it.

2290
02:18:56,971 --> 02:19:00,000
It seems like the one thing they
worked on before and you know, and,

2291
02:19:00,590 --> 02:19:04,830
and I don't know. You can, you can,
you can give me some advice on this.

2292
02:19:05,070 --> 02:19:07,350
Is it better because
I've done it both ways.

2293
02:19:07,440 --> 02:19:10,260
Is it better to submit them with
the same thing every single time,

2294
02:19:11,100 --> 02:19:14,190
which I've done that or to submit them
so with something new every single time

2295
02:19:14,670 --> 02:19:17,700
where they just are dumbfounded.
Yeah. I think the second one gets,

2296
02:19:17,701 --> 02:19:20,400
especially given what you said,
because it's true, the wrestler,

2297
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:23,850
he's going to have all this knowledge
of grappling so, and it makes sense,

2298
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:27,590
you know? So you see this one weird
thing that you'd ever seen in your mind.

2299
02:19:27,591 --> 02:19:28,000
You're like,
all

2300
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,030
right, that's weird. Kind of rare kind
of thing. It's the feeling and then,

2301
02:19:32,031 --> 02:19:34,490
but if you're like this thing, this
thing, this, and then it's like, okay,

2302
02:19:34,520 --> 02:19:39,080
this world is opening up now
on, okay, I understand. Yes.

2303
02:19:39,081 --> 02:19:41,210
It wasn't just that one thing, like
how you said it, that one thing,

2304
02:19:41,211 --> 02:19:45,060
I just got to stay away from
his or putting my neck and
I just stay away from it.

2305
02:19:45,810 --> 02:19:49,910
So it kind of or,
or deviates from that whole idea.

2306
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:53,600
So we'll be having these discussions
and many more at the immersion camp in

2307
02:19:53,601 --> 02:19:57,740
Maine in August.
August,

2308
02:19:58,130 --> 02:20:01,010
right before school starts. Yeah. So yeah,

2309
02:20:01,460 --> 02:20:05,900
those are good fun anyway. Yeah.
Origin main dot. Come check it out.

2310
02:20:06,470 --> 02:20:07,960
Good way to support.
Also,

2311
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:12,740
Jack talked about his new cool kettle
bell that's heavier than my nonetheless.

2312
02:20:12,770 --> 02:20:15,470
I got the whole set on, you know, you
know what Taylor I'm talking about, right?

2313
02:20:16,210 --> 02:20:18,460
Or the,
the primal belts,

2314
02:20:19,870 --> 02:20:23,780
whatever is I think is like a
cyclops in there too. Anyway.

2315
02:20:23,910 --> 02:20:26,580
Anymore word on the Jocko head
or is that that happen yet.

2316
02:20:26,610 --> 02:20:30,530
Still work in progress. The idea phase
on. I'm still, but yeah, that was good.

2317
02:20:30,531 --> 02:20:32,330
But nonetheless you want the whole set.

2318
02:20:32,850 --> 02:20:37,280
Put a on it.com/jocko really good kettle
bells in their other exercise stuff on

2319
02:20:37,281 --> 02:20:41,330
there too. You want to switch up your
workout. I ran into that the other day.

2320
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:43,490
I'm like, Dang, this
workout is getting boring.

2321
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:47,810
So like just BTF through it and
did, did you, cause it's good to,

2322
02:20:47,811 --> 02:20:50,570
to do things and you
brought this up before eve,

2323
02:20:50,571 --> 02:20:53,180
you're not used to something even
though it's like we talked about squats,

2324
02:20:53,210 --> 02:20:56,060
like going all the way down,
which is what I'm used to.

2325
02:20:56,240 --> 02:21:00,890
If I was to do squats to what
does it parallels of the deck,

2326
02:21:00,970 --> 02:21:02,600
this the standard. Yeah, the standard.

2327
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:05,360
Then those squats would actually be
a little bit harder for me. Yeah.

2328
02:21:05,361 --> 02:21:07,010
For like a week or two weeks.

2329
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:10,670
And then I'd realize that going down in
the hole is the place where you could

2330
02:21:10,671 --> 02:21:13,990
get, but, and it goes along with exactly
what you were saying, how like your,

2331
02:21:13,991 --> 02:21:17,120
your brain has to do is called
neuromuscular connection,

2332
02:21:17,121 --> 02:21:18,980
where if you're used to
doing a certain motion,

2333
02:21:18,981 --> 02:21:21,350
you can do it way more efficiently,
putting more weight on there.

2334
02:21:21,351 --> 02:21:22,430
And we're pretty efficient,
you know,

2335
02:21:22,550 --> 02:21:25,010
and that's what gain
where gains come from or,

2336
02:21:25,050 --> 02:21:28,700
or a big part of where it gains
come from. Um, so yeah, you just,

2337
02:21:28,701 --> 02:21:33,590
you just change the movement just a
little bit. Boom. Whole nother thing.

2338
02:21:33,591 --> 02:21:36,360
Your body got to get used to more
gains to be had. Well that's the whole

2339
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:38,690
theory of Westside barbell is,
and they change their,

2340
02:21:38,750 --> 02:21:41,030
the way they do something every
three weeks, they either, yeah.

2341
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:44,690
Instead of doing this bench press the
same exact way that they did that for

2342
02:21:44,691 --> 02:21:46,280
three weeks and then in the
next three weeks they do it.

2343
02:21:46,281 --> 02:21:47,800
Why do they do it with
a different kind of bar?

2344
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:50,540
They do it different range of motion.
So once you,

2345
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:55,920
they don't allow their buy to totally
adapt to the constantly changing.

2346
02:21:56,360 --> 02:21:57,760
Yeah. Yeah. Is Pretty,

2347
02:21:57,890 --> 02:22:00,950
there's a lot of cool ways you can
kind of manipulate that from workout to

2348
02:22:00,951 --> 02:22:02,390
workout. But yeah. Well that's so yeah.

2349
02:22:02,391 --> 02:22:05,960
If you want to vary up your workout with
all kinds of different movements on it,

2350
02:22:05,961 --> 02:22:10,520
they have some cool stuff. Battled
Macy's or no battle ropes, Macy's,

2351
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:15,380
some other stuff on it. Dotcom
slash jungle, good spot. Also,

2352
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:20,260
when you buy the books that we
sometimes review on this podcast, um,

2353
02:22:20,780 --> 02:22:24,710
I got them all organized on Jocko,
podcast.com in the book section.

2354
02:22:25,950 --> 02:22:28,380
Click, just click through
there. It takes you to Amazon.

2355
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:33,240
Amazon prime if you have it and uh, you
know, get your book, good way to support.

2356
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:37,650
If you do another shopping,
continue do your shopping,

2357
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:40,410
buy that lawnmower you've
been meaning to buy.

2358
02:22:40,770 --> 02:22:44,970
Also subscribed to the podcast if you
haven't already. It seems obvious.

2359
02:22:44,971 --> 02:22:47,610
I know iTunes, stitcher, Google play,

2360
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:53,540
Spotify and other podcasting
providing podcast,

2361
02:22:53,731 --> 02:22:57,540
providing platforms also in youtube
cause we do have a youtube channel.

2362
02:22:57,570 --> 02:23:00,690
Rob Jones, I know you're
on there. Sometimes

2363
02:23:02,670 --> 02:23:03,870
we have excerpts.

2364
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:08,900
I think that's really one of the main
values is the excerpts of first podcasts

2365
02:23:09,720 --> 02:23:12,300
for sure.
Because yeah cause a lot of times,

2366
02:23:12,301 --> 02:23:16,790
I mean aside from seeing what you
and our guests look like, you know,

2367
02:23:16,810 --> 02:23:20,880
live video version of
whatever the excerpts are
shareable and I didn't realize

2368
02:23:20,881 --> 02:23:25,881
how valuable that was with the sharing
until when I think it's a gradually

2369
02:23:27,690 --> 02:23:31,470
increasing understanding of
the value overall. Nonetheless,

2370
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:33,750
I could go into a whole thing about like,

2371
02:23:33,751 --> 02:23:36,150
hey could you make an answer to this
and make an extra for this and make it,

2372
02:23:36,570 --> 02:23:38,760
you're just starting to realize that the,
maybe they had a reason for that.

2373
02:23:39,240 --> 02:23:43,140
We'll just say I'm realizing it more.
How about that check nonetheless,

2374
02:23:43,530 --> 02:23:45,840
good value there in my opinion,
and a good way to support.

2375
02:23:45,841 --> 02:23:50,580
Still subscribe to the Youtube
Channel if you want. Also,

2376
02:23:50,730 --> 02:23:54,510
Jack was a store. If you didn't know
already, it's called Jocko store.

2377
02:23:55,290 --> 02:23:59,790
Go to [inaudible] store.com and if you
want the shirts that say discipline

2378
02:23:59,791 --> 02:24:01,170
equals freedom,
get after it.

2379
02:24:02,070 --> 02:24:06,000
The warrior kid shirt like this or they
should that Jack always aware as the

2380
02:24:06,001 --> 02:24:08,340
victory, MMA and fitness,
that's where he can get it.

2381
02:24:08,341 --> 02:24:10,380
That's where you get chocolate store.com.

2382
02:24:10,410 --> 02:24:15,210
We need to make grey ones of these
gray. Just gray. Heather Gray.

2383
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:19,020
I don't care. I don't know
what gray gray can we do that,

2384
02:24:19,430 --> 02:24:22,890
but that's a general term. You know
gray. It's like you can't just say, hey,

2385
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:26,790
you know you gotta. I need three shirts
for that summertime that's coming.

2386
02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:29,370
You got it.
There are 50 different shades of gray.

2387
02:24:29,371 --> 02:24:30,940
There's a whole [inaudible] right?

2388
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:36,630
This guy doesn't know
you're talking about either.

2389
02:24:36,631 --> 02:24:40,580
That's the funniest pop culture reference.
Yeah, 50 shades of grey. I know.

2390
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:43,980
Nonetheless,
I'll make the gray one.

2391
02:24:43,981 --> 02:24:48,450
So there will be a great victory MMA
and fitness shirt available on Jocko

2392
02:24:48,451 --> 02:24:52,560
store.com soon. I like it. I promise.

2393
02:24:52,860 --> 02:24:54,300
Also some women's stuff on there,

2394
02:24:54,720 --> 02:24:58,830
some patches and just got the patches
reordered so they should be in there,

2395
02:24:59,190 --> 02:25:03,510
you know, starts running better now.
It is. So, you know, take it up.

2396
02:25:03,511 --> 02:25:06,960
We're happy to hear that. Yeah
man. Yeah, it means a lot to us.

2397
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:07,831
Some hoodies on there,

2398
02:25:07,831 --> 02:25:12,831
some rash guards on there for various
activities including but not limited to

2399
02:25:12,991 --> 02:25:15,900
Jujitsu cycling.
Um,

2400
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,430
there was a guy on Twitter,
Instagram, I think he ran,

2401
02:25:20,431 --> 02:25:22,080
I think a marathon,
I think.

2402
02:25:22,410 --> 02:25:26,740
Nice presenting with representing big
time with the get after it. Rash Guard.

2403
02:25:27,100 --> 02:25:31,930
He said he did it 50% better.
50% better. There you go.

2404
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:37,210
There you go. Factual proof is in
the pudding. So boom, rash guard.

2405
02:25:37,211 --> 02:25:40,520
Yes. Taco start.com look at that
stuff. I'm not saying buy something.

2406
02:25:40,521 --> 02:25:42,640
I'm saying if you want something,
get something.

2407
02:25:42,700 --> 02:25:45,430
Good way to support also
psychological warfare.

2408
02:25:45,940 --> 02:25:49,690
I'm going to explain what it is again.
It's no problem for me.

2409
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:53,260
It is an album,
not a music album.

2410
02:25:53,380 --> 02:25:58,300
It's a spoken word album with tracks.
And these tracks are for,

2411
02:25:58,301 --> 02:26:02,200
they have a purpose, not just
entertainment, like, Ooh, this poetic.

2412
02:26:02,560 --> 02:26:05,110
It is poetic,
but that's not the purpose.

2413
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:09,940
The purpose is for each track is to get
you through. When you're on the path,

2414
02:26:09,970 --> 02:26:11,830
on the campaign against weakness,

2415
02:26:11,890 --> 02:26:16,300
you'll run into these moments of weakness,
right?

2416
02:26:16,330 --> 02:26:20,290
Just little insert weakness,
insurgents, if you will. You know,

2417
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:22,480
they show up every once in a while.

2418
02:26:23,590 --> 02:26:27,790
So you listen to a specific track
designated for a certain type of weakness

2419
02:26:27,791 --> 02:26:28,624
that'll creep in.

2420
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:34,290
And the track is Jocko telling you
why you should overcome this weakness.

2421
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:39,340
Why Hi doc. How as well, it's
not chuckle yelling at you.

2422
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:41,890
It's just a pragmatic kind of in a waste.

2423
02:26:41,920 --> 02:26:44,590
The steps to take to overcome
these weaknesses. Boom.

2424
02:26:44,650 --> 02:26:49,650
A hundred percent a hundred
percent a hundred percent,

2425
02:26:50,860 --> 02:26:53,530
hundred percent. Uh, what do you
thought success rate on that one?

2426
02:26:53,890 --> 02:26:56,830
In my experience,
100% good way to support.

2427
02:26:57,440 --> 02:27:01,670
You can also get Jocko
white tea on Amazon.

2428
02:27:02,150 --> 02:27:04,000
It's called Jocko white tea pure.

2429
02:27:04,100 --> 02:27:08,300
And that's for people that
want to deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2430
02:27:08,780 --> 02:27:13,640
And this is another scientifically
proven, factually double blind, placebo,

2431
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:17,040
placebo proven.
Somebody on or,

2432
02:27:17,090 --> 02:27:21,250
but I don't want to say somebody's k.
There's this guy he did lit, I dunno,

2433
02:27:21,290 --> 02:27:24,920
he dead lifted a bunch. Oh Yay.
Yeah. What's that? Who's that guy?

2434
02:27:24,921 --> 02:27:27,530
He's huge and he's worn for,

2435
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:33,020
yeah. So on the Arnold Classic
and he won the Arnold Classic.

2436
02:27:33,060 --> 02:27:38,060
So I've been seeing a lot of that video
to are a lot of people are wanting to

2437
02:27:38,421 --> 02:27:41,370
test him to see if he
wasn't a Jocko white tea. Oh

2438
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:47,420
No, you can't. You won't test. It
doesn't test positive. Yeah. Yeah. He's,

2439
02:27:47,630 --> 02:27:51,020
he only did a little bit, but the dead
lift. Yeah, he only did a little bit.

2440
02:27:56,910 --> 02:27:59,780
Uh, yeah. So that's Jocko
white tea. You can get that.

2441
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:03,850
But that's coming in a cam by the way.
It's going to,

2442
02:28:04,030 --> 02:28:06,740
in starting production,
it takes a long time,

2443
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:11,960
but by the summertime you'll be getting
Jocko white tea and it can like,

2444
02:28:11,961 --> 02:28:12,794
uh,

2445
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:17,860
like one of the other energy drinks that
just fill you with sugar and get you

2446
02:28:18,561 --> 02:28:21,140
crazy. No, this is going to
fill you with antioxidants,

2447
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:26,330
little bit of caffeine and some good
tastes. So yeah, that's common. Let's see,

2448
02:28:26,331 --> 02:28:27,530
what else?
Books,

2449
02:28:27,650 --> 02:28:32,650
speaking of books on Amazon or
wherever way the warrior kid you,

2450
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:37,610
you should have that book
for all children, right?

2451
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:38,593
Is there any children?

2452
02:28:38,630 --> 02:28:43,430
Is there any child in the world that
doesn't need way of the warrior kid? No.

2453
02:28:43,460 --> 02:28:46,850
Didn't think so. So get that and
speaking a way that whether your kid,

2454
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:51,910
there's a new way of the warrior kid
that is outright now available for

2455
02:28:52,311 --> 02:28:56,180
preorder. So get it.

2456
02:28:56,600 --> 02:29:00,210
And one of the things that I would
like to do, everyone tells me, uh,

2457
02:29:00,410 --> 02:29:03,590
things like everyone should
get way of the warrior kid.

2458
02:29:03,591 --> 02:29:06,330
Every kid should read this book. Every
kid should read this book in high school,

2459
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:08,060
Orrin in their school.

2460
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:12,650
People say that to me all the
time because it's very simple,

2461
02:29:12,651 --> 02:29:17,270
clear lessons that everybody
should absorb and it would help.

2462
02:29:17,271 --> 02:29:19,100
It would have helped
me if I had that book.

2463
02:29:19,220 --> 02:29:21,140
It would have helped
everybody when they had that,

2464
02:29:21,200 --> 02:29:22,310
if they had that book
when they're younger.

2465
02:29:22,610 --> 02:29:25,760
So want to get this book
out there in two more kids.

2466
02:29:25,880 --> 02:29:27,110
One of the best ways to do that,

2467
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:32,030
if you order way the warrior
kid to Mark's mission,

2468
02:29:32,480 --> 02:29:37,340
order it from different sources. Get it
from Amazon, get it from Barnes and noble.

2469
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:41,570
Go to your local bookstore and say, Hey,
can you please order this book for me?

2470
02:29:42,530 --> 02:29:47,530
We want to get it spread out where a
bunch of different outlets are seeing the

2471
02:29:49,161 --> 02:29:49,994
demand for it.

2472
02:29:50,300 --> 02:29:55,300
That will increase the publicity that
the book receives and it will get into

2473
02:29:56,121 --> 02:29:57,110
more kids' hands.

2474
02:29:57,200 --> 02:30:02,200
That's my goal is to get more kids to
read way the word kid and to read Marx

2475
02:30:02,781 --> 02:30:06,500
mission, so do that. It's alive.

2476
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:09,680
I'm also speaking to warrior kids.

2477
02:30:09,770 --> 02:30:12,500
If you want to support a warrior kid,

2478
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:17,150
there's a warrior kid that's a farmer
and a businessman and he's making soap

2479
02:30:17,151 --> 02:30:22,050
from goat milk. Why? Cause he's getting
after it. You can order some of that.

2480
02:30:22,051 --> 02:30:26,090
An Irish oaks ranch.com and the motto,
because he makes,

2481
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:30,980
he doesn't just make so few mixed Jocko,
so hey, he wanted to make good soap day.

2482
02:30:31,370 --> 02:30:35,330
I quote, I want to make good
soap. G O o d capitalized,

2483
02:30:36,380 --> 02:30:40,610
so he makes Jocko soap. Smells
like coconut by the way. Really?

2484
02:30:41,030 --> 02:30:44,480
As I like to smell of coconut.
Yeah. Is there a cool Canadian? Yes.

2485
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:48,200
I didn't find it to smell like
it smells it dealt with death.

2486
02:30:48,290 --> 02:30:49,280
You don't think it smells like coconut?

2487
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:54,140
Well maybe you have a more sensitive
why in a an old factory and the factory

2488
02:30:54,141 --> 02:30:55,580
sensitive situation.
Yeah,

2489
02:30:55,880 --> 02:31:00,230
but the motto from Taco stope stay clean.

2490
02:31:01,640 --> 02:31:06,560
Discipline equals freedom field manual.
Again, you know, I was traveling around I,

2491
02:31:06,670 --> 02:31:09,920
I signed a lot of these books and I just
traveled around when I was in Australia.

2492
02:31:09,921 --> 02:31:13,370
A lot of people brought it in and that
was awesome. A lot of great feedback.

2493
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:17,600
One thing that's good if you have that
book and you like it and helped you get

2494
02:31:17,601 --> 02:31:20,430
it for someone else that you know that
that wants to get on the path or should

2495
02:31:20,431 --> 02:31:23,100
be on the path,
so that's pretty easy to do.

2496
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:29,360
Also the audio version of that book does
not exist on audible.com it exists on

2497
02:31:30,571 --> 02:31:34,440
iTunes, Amazon music, Google
play, other MP, three platforms.

2498
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:40,260
It's an album with tracks. Sure. That's
why we did it that way. And finally,

2499
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,850
of course,
extreme ownership.

2500
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:45,570
The new version of extreme
ownership is out look black one,

2501
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:50,700
which looks cool. It's got a
little excerpt, new beginning,

2502
02:31:50,701 --> 02:31:54,660
and it's got an excerpt of Q and
a from this podcast in the back,

2503
02:31:54,690 --> 02:31:59,010
which is solid. How long is that part
of it? I don't know if they, I mean,

2504
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:01,830
you know how much of that is, I think
there's eight questions. I mean in there,

2505
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:06,840
you know answers, which is pretty
robust and it's fairly robust.

2506
02:32:06,970 --> 02:32:07,803
Yeah,

2507
02:32:08,490 --> 02:32:12,000
and speaking of leadership,

2508
02:32:12,840 --> 02:32:16,590
we have a company national on front.
We solve problems through leadership.

2509
02:32:17,250 --> 02:32:20,730
That's what we do. And we do it all the
time. It's me, Lafe, Babin, JP Denelle,

2510
02:32:20,880 --> 02:32:21,713

of course there is the muster,
which is a leadership gathering,

2513
02:32:32,260 --> 02:32:35,250
a leadership seminar, a leadership
conference. What do you learn?

2514
02:32:35,251 --> 02:32:39,450
Their pragmatic leadership skills so
you can win. That's what you learned.

2515
02:32:39,600 --> 02:32:43,530
We're only doing two this year.
We're doing one in Washington DC.

2516
02:32:44,060 --> 02:32:46,410
You come and May 17th and 18th yeah.
Okay.

2517

So you can come meet v Rob Jones and
then we're doing one in San Francisco

2518
02:32:51,990 --> 02:32:56,990

by the way right now is already,

2519
02:32:57,600 --> 02:32:59,430
it's more than half sold out right now.

2520
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:02,970
So these are both going to sell out
just like all the events that we've done

2521
02:33:02,971 --> 02:33:03,720
have sold out.

muster, if you want to hang with us,

2524
02:33:12,690 --> 02:33:15,720

02:33:30,780 --> 02:33:35,400
and on top of that, Rob Jones
has his own podcast. Now

2529
02:33:37,110 --> 02:33:41,510
he's one episode deep pool, one episode
deep ones. He's on the path. Yeah.

2530
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:45,510
The podcast is called used the
weight. Yep. Oh, that's good. Yeah.

2531
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:50,530
I remember miss the way, which
is you see the logo. Yeah.

2532
02:33:50,640 --> 02:33:54,990
So you can get that wherever MP3 are,
sorry.

2533
02:33:54,991 --> 02:33:57,000
Podcasts are available.

2534
02:33:57,540 --> 02:34:00,300
I've listened to the first episode.

2535
02:34:00,750 --> 02:34:05,120
You talk about getting after it and yeah,

2536
02:34:05,130 --> 02:34:07,710
you talk about how to get through a lot
of things, so, so it's, it's awesome.

2537
02:34:08,050 --> 02:34:12,770
Can I add to that? I'm kind
of an advice style. Uh,

2538
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,860
podcasts right now are
people asking me questions?

2539
02:34:14,861 --> 02:34:16,960
So all those people listen to this,

2540
02:34:17,050 --> 02:34:21,730
know you're sending question after
question to Jocko and he just refuses to

2541
02:34:21,731 --> 02:34:22,564
answer you this.

2542
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:30,250
He reads it and then just throws it in
the trash. No, I'm just kidding. Um,

2543
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:35,380
but yeah, if anybody has questions, uh,
that they want to get answered by me,

2544
02:34:36,130 --> 02:34:40,690
then send them to
me@arobjonesjourneyatgmail.com
or through my website or

2545
02:34:40,691 --> 02:34:43,440
through social media
and I will answer them.

2546
02:34:43,470 --> 02:34:46,810
You just gave out your website
on this. That's awesome. Yeah.

2547
02:34:47,650 --> 02:34:51,760
I'll fight emailing me. Oh No,
that's my, that's my special email.

2548
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:52,720
That's not like my personal,

2549
02:34:52,721 --> 02:34:57,070
that's my specialty mail that
I give out for stuff like this.

2550
02:34:57,100 --> 02:35:00,610
Hey also helps to keep it kind of
separated. So all my questions,

2551
02:35:00,611 --> 02:35:04,450
I can just check it on email so you don't
get to sift. Yeah. So I have to sift it.

2552
02:35:05,900 --> 02:35:08,170
Dang.
I got to learn that lesson too little bit.

2553
02:35:10,990 --> 02:35:14,710
Did I miss anything else
from your various platforms?

2554
02:35:14,920 --> 02:35:18,730
I mean I am working on a book too. Oh,
awesome. It's, and there's no real,

2555
02:35:19,630 --> 02:35:23,890
uh, you know, date to
release date or anything,

2556
02:35:23,891 --> 02:35:28,380
but I'm hoping it's going to
be a book about veterans, um,

2557
02:35:28,420 --> 02:35:29,890
and the positive

2558
02:35:31,720 --> 02:35:36,160
and just continuing to create that story
that I was talking about earlier about

2559
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:41,170
and telling that side of the coin about
veterans that come home and are fine.

2560
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:41,830
Yeah.

2561
02:35:41,830 --> 02:35:46,330
And I'm hoping it's going to be right now
I'm kind of making it kind of like you

2562
02:35:46,331 --> 02:35:49,340
ever read anything by, uh, by uh,

2563
02:35:50,920 --> 02:35:55,920
Plato about he had basically all of his
writing is conversations that Socrates

2564
02:35:57,161 --> 02:35:57,880
had.
Yeah.

2565
02:35:57,880 --> 02:36:00,640
So I'm hoping I'm going to make it kind
of like that where it's just basically

2566
02:36:00,641 --> 02:36:02,820
this a series of conversations between and

2567
02:36:02,830 --> 02:36:05,810
two people. And this, I just thought
this way you were saying this,

2568
02:36:05,811 --> 02:36:08,960
cause I think this is another important
thing about on that exact subject,

2569
02:36:09,740 --> 02:36:14,740
and we were talking earlier about these
two categories of like the vet comes

2570
02:36:15,030 --> 02:36:17,960
that comes home and he's good in the
vet that comes home and he's a little

2571
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:22,430
little bit off track. Yeah.
But I would like to say,

2572
02:36:22,431 --> 02:36:24,230
and I know you're going to agree
with this a hundred percent,

2573
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:26,060
just because you're a
little bit off track,

2574
02:36:26,130 --> 02:36:27,120
it doesn't mean you're going to get you,

2575
02:36:27,121 --> 02:36:29,350
you can't easily get back on track or the,

2576
02:36:29,360 --> 02:36:31,370
I've known all kinds
of veterans that they,

2577
02:36:31,390 --> 02:36:34,640
they were off track a little bit for a
little while and then they figure it out

2578
02:36:34,670 --> 02:36:38,570
and they get back on track. They find
a new mission. So you know the guys,

2579
02:36:38,571 --> 02:36:40,850
and that's actually fairly common in my,

2580
02:36:40,880 --> 02:36:45,880
in Mott from what I've seen and actually
talking to a lot of guys that that went

2581
02:36:46,821 --> 02:36:50,540
through Vietnam and they'd come home from
Vietnam and they were a little messed

2582
02:36:50,541 --> 02:36:54,440
up when they got home, you
know, and they got through it,

2583
02:36:54,470 --> 02:36:57,770
got over it and got it out of their
system and moved on. And again,

2584
02:36:57,771 --> 02:36:59,120
we've talked about,
I've talked about this before,

2585
02:36:59,121 --> 02:37:00,530
you know when you got
done with World War II,

2586
02:37:00,531 --> 02:37:04,200
you sat on a ship with a bunch of other
vets for six weeks and you debrief to

2587
02:37:04,201 --> 02:37:07,850
everything on a ride home and you got
that out of your system and you've got to

2588
02:37:07,851 --> 02:37:12,260
communicate and you got, you moved
through it mentally, Vietnam,

2589
02:37:12,261 --> 02:37:14,270
they didn't have that opportunity.
Vietnam, it was, oh yeah,

2590
02:37:14,271 --> 02:37:18,050
you're in Vietnam and then tomorrow
you're in San Francisco alone. By the way,

2591
02:37:18,051 --> 02:37:20,390
you're not with anybody else.
You're not with any other veterans.

2592
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:24,020
D nowadays we do a pretty good
job of when you come home,

2593
02:37:24,021 --> 02:37:26,120
you're coming home with your unit,
you stay together,

2594
02:37:26,121 --> 02:37:30,080
you have people to talk to that have
the common experience. But yeah,

2595
02:37:30,081 --> 02:37:31,760
to the vets out there that are thinking,
oh man,

2596
02:37:31,761 --> 02:37:34,880
I feel like I might be one of those guys
that's not on the right track right now.

2597
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:37,700
You can get back on the
right track and it's,

2598
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:42,080
it's finding your new mission and
moving down that path towards towards

2599
02:37:42,081 --> 02:37:42,840
achieving it

2600
02:37:42,840 --> 02:37:45,630
and just trying everything that
you possibly can. Like for me,

2601
02:37:45,631 --> 02:37:50,631
it's easy to figure out what I needed to
do because there was a system in place

2602
02:37:51,001 --> 02:37:54,240
and it's an obvious physical injury.
But with the mental injuries,

2603
02:37:54,241 --> 02:37:58,410
we don't exactly know how to fix them yet,
but you just have to keep trying this.

2604
02:37:58,500 --> 02:38:01,380
All right. Try talking about it with the
therapist didn't work. All right. I try,

2605
02:38:02,040 --> 02:38:05,340
you know, hyperbolic chambers or
whatever. Try this, try that, try that.

2606
02:38:05,341 --> 02:38:09,300
And because just because you tried one
thing and it didn't work out doesn't mean

2607
02:38:09,301 --> 02:38:10,350
that you don't want to,

2608
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:15,300
doesn't mean that you now are fine with,
you know,

2609
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:16,980
nightmares and stuff.

2610
02:38:16,981 --> 02:38:20,130
You just got to keep trying everything
until everything's exhausted.

2611
02:38:20,460 --> 02:38:24,290
Yeah. And I'll tell you, I've,
I've, in talking to, to, uh,

2612
02:38:24,900 --> 02:38:25,733
Jordan Peterson,

2613
02:38:26,280 --> 02:38:30,330
the couple times we've had them out here
into listening to him in reading his

2614
02:38:30,331 --> 02:38:31,164
book,

2615
02:38:31,890 --> 02:38:35,760
it's become very obvious to me and it's
sort of reflective of something that

2616
02:38:35,761 --> 02:38:40,350
Dakota Meyer said on the podcast, which
is like, hey, there's a, your, your,

2617
02:38:40,610 --> 02:38:45,300
your brain, your, your mentality, your
psychology as a system and just like,

2618
02:38:45,540 --> 02:38:48,870
just like you have a system to move
through when you have a physical injury to

2619
02:38:48,871 --> 02:38:52,170
get healed or get corrected.
Well,

2620
02:38:52,171 --> 02:38:55,140
this is the same thing with
your psychological state.

2621
02:38:55,590 --> 02:38:58,560
And if that psychological state is off
a little bit, well there's things that,

2622
02:38:58,561 --> 02:38:59,940
there's people that know how to fix it.

2623
02:38:59,941 --> 02:39:04,500
If you listen to when Jordan's talking
about the way that he would bring someone

2624
02:39:04,501 --> 02:39:07,200
through a problem,
there's a systematic way to do that.

2625
02:39:07,560 --> 02:39:11,190
And I never really understood that until
I started listening to him because,

2626
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:14,550
you know, when they'd send us to the
psychologist to debrief a deployment,

2627
02:39:14,880 --> 02:39:18,680
you know, for me it was just
sort of, uh, you know, I had the,

2628
02:39:18,690 --> 02:39:20,430
the negative attitude of all this,

2629
02:39:20,520 --> 02:39:23,340
I'm not going to tell this guy anything
cause I don't want them to think I'm

2630
02:39:23,341 --> 02:39:28,170
crazy and I don't want to get, you
know, put on whatever, you know, thing.

2631
02:39:28,320 --> 02:39:31,210
And so I just was, hey, I'm just
gonna move forward and, and,

2632
02:39:31,470 --> 02:39:35,700
and that's sort of my eye and I'll tell
you when I was in that was a very common

2633
02:39:35,701 --> 02:39:38,130
attitude was, hey, look,
I'm not going to tell this.

2634
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:40,440
This psychologist does know
what I've been through,

2635
02:39:41,040 --> 02:39:44,520
so I'm not going to tell him anything.
That was a very common, and again,

2636
02:39:44,521 --> 02:39:49,170
I think for me, listening to Jordan,
because I would have been, you know,

2637
02:39:49,171 --> 02:39:52,800
two years ago or a year ago before
I started listening to, to, uh,

2638
02:39:52,860 --> 02:39:56,400
Jordan Peterson talk,
I never really saw the connection.

2639
02:39:56,820 --> 02:39:59,850
And then it really solidified it. When
I heard Dakota talking about it, saying,

2640
02:39:59,851 --> 02:40:03,000
look, this is a, I put
the two and two together.

2641
02:40:03,001 --> 02:40:06,810
When I heard Dakota talking about it,
like there's people just like,

2642
02:40:06,930 --> 02:40:11,720
if you wanted to get good at Olympic
lifting, you'd go to an Olympia.

2643
02:40:11,720 --> 02:40:13,050
If you try to figure that out on your,

2644
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,250
it would take you forever and you might
get hurt. You might get hurt worse.

2645
02:40:18,330 --> 02:40:21,120
Whereas if you went to a real
Olympic lifting coach and said, hey,

2646
02:40:21,121 --> 02:40:24,330
I want to learn the clean and jerk
and the snatch, they would say, okay,

2647
02:40:24,331 --> 02:40:26,270
here's what we're gonna Start.
We're gonna start with a PVC pipe,

2648
02:40:26,271 --> 02:40:27,270
and then we're gonna
go through the motions.

2649
02:40:27,271 --> 02:40:28,980
They were going to get better at this,
and they're going to do high poles.

2650
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:32,250
They're going to walk you
through the whole system. And,

2651
02:40:32,280 --> 02:40:35,880
and a psychologist will do that with
your brain. They'll say, oh, okay,

2652
02:40:35,881 --> 02:40:39,480
I see what you're scared of. Needles
as the example. Jordan Peterson again,

2653
02:40:39,600 --> 02:40:41,910
here's what we're going to do
to get you used to needles.

2654
02:40:41,911 --> 02:40:43,530
Well when you come back
from a traumatic event,

2655
02:40:43,740 --> 02:40:45,990
here's some things that we can do to,
to revisit that.

2656
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:49,740
And I think the same thing that you
talked about earlier with like movies.

2657
02:40:50,370 --> 02:40:54,630
I think the part of my prejudice against
psychologists came from the way that

2658
02:40:54,631 --> 02:40:58,470
they're portrayed in movies as being like,
you know,

2659
02:40:58,471 --> 02:41:02,460
he's sitting on this couch and like
these weird people that you know,

2660
02:41:02,461 --> 02:41:04,680
and it's not, it's more
pragmatic than that. Yeah.

2661
02:41:04,700 --> 02:41:07,880
At least it seems that way to me.
So it's like a trainer kind of alert,

2662
02:41:07,890 --> 02:41:10,960
like a trainer and more like,
uh, more like a coach, right?

2663
02:41:11,440 --> 02:41:14,250
More like a coach or more like a Jujitsu
instructor that's saying like, Hey,

2664
02:41:14,251 --> 02:41:16,230
here's what you need to do here.
You get caught in this position,

2665
02:41:16,231 --> 02:41:19,500
here's what you need to do. The
psychologist says, Oh, you're having,

2666
02:41:20,280 --> 02:41:23,670
you're having bad dreams about
this. Okay, let's try these things.

2667
02:41:23,671 --> 02:41:25,840
And I don't know what those
things are because I don't know,

2668
02:41:25,841 --> 02:41:27,360
I'm not a psychologist,
but they do know,

2669
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:30,660
they do know what to tell you to do and
they do know how to help you get through

2670
02:41:30,661 --> 02:41:31,170
those things.

2671
02:41:31,170 --> 02:41:34,440
And just like Jujitsu or just like
athletic training or just like Olympic

2672
02:41:34,441 --> 02:41:37,170
lifting,
it's going to vary for different people.

2673
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:42,200
And a good psychological coach is
going to have a know how to make those

2674
02:41:43,291 --> 02:41:45,450
adjustments and say, Oh, you're
feeling this a little bit more.

2675
02:41:45,570 --> 02:41:47,070
Oh it's because you came
from this kind of family,

2676
02:41:47,071 --> 02:41:48,660
so this is what's going to help you.

2677
02:41:48,750 --> 02:41:50,220
But you came from a
different side of family,

2678
02:41:50,221 --> 02:41:53,430
so this is gonna help you
a little different way. So
I think those things are,

2679
02:41:53,490 --> 02:41:55,070
are important to think about.
And again,

2680
02:41:55,110 --> 02:41:59,250
I've just wanted to reemphasize the
point that just because you might be in a

2681
02:41:59,251 --> 02:42:04,020
Rut as a, either as a vet or just
as a human being, you know, there's,

2682
02:42:04,110 --> 02:42:06,570
there's every little decision you make,

2683
02:42:06,571 --> 02:42:11,571
you can start moving in the
right direction and moving
towards a better place in

2684
02:42:12,241 --> 02:42:15,090
your life and in everything that you're
doing. So just wanted to bring that out.

2685
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:18,090
Echo. You got any other, anything else?

2686
02:42:18,980 --> 02:42:23,080
All good. Good to see you again.
Oh man, it's so awesome to be here.

2687
02:42:23,630 --> 02:42:28,550
Just be included among the,
the people that, uh, you guys
deem worthy of. You know,

2688
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:30,050
it takes a long time to do this.

2689
02:42:30,051 --> 02:42:33,380
It takes a lot of preparation
and it's just for you guys to,

2690
02:42:33,830 --> 02:42:38,090
to take that time and spend it on
preparing to have me as a guest. It's a,

2691
02:42:38,930 --> 02:42:40,500
it's a huge compliment and honor,

2692
02:42:41,140 --> 02:42:43,540
honor for us.
Do you have any other closing thoughts?

2693
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:46,230
Yeah, just want to point
out that, uh, you know,

2694
02:42:46,231 --> 02:42:51,231
I'm the one here in the hot seat and
I'm getting all the accolades and um,

2695
02:42:52,650 --> 02:42:53,580
but you know,
I didn't,

2696
02:42:53,581 --> 02:42:58,350
I didn't do anything that I've
accomplished without people helping me.

2697
02:42:58,351 --> 02:43:00,750
I like to, it's kind of
like a pyramid. Like I'm,

2698
02:43:00,751 --> 02:43:04,980
I'm the tip of the pyramid on like the
thing that everybody likes to see and

2699
02:43:04,981 --> 02:43:06,270
that's the top of the pyramid,

2700
02:43:06,271 --> 02:43:11,271
but there's a whole gigantic
base underneath this pyramid
that if the tip didn't

2701
02:43:11,981 --> 02:43:16,120
have it, then the tip would just
be a stupid rock. And so, you know,

2702
02:43:16,121 --> 02:43:21,121
I all the way since my recovery and I've
had supporting people and my family and

2703
02:43:23,080 --> 02:43:25,440
especially on this month, the
marathons thing I just did. If, if,

2704
02:43:26,380 --> 02:43:29,680
if my wife hadn't been there,
if Pam hadn't been there,

2705
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:35,100
then it's not happening at all. I mean,
there's some things that I could say,

2706
02:43:35,101 --> 02:43:38,110
you know, I cut it, could have done it,
uh, but it wouldn't have been as good,

2707
02:43:38,111 --> 02:43:40,720
but this thing would not have
happened without her. She, I mean,

2708
02:43:40,721 --> 02:43:45,170
I totally gave her the reins. I, you know,

2709
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:50,220
set it up and if there was any questions
she had about overall vision for what I

2710
02:43:51,641 --> 02:43:52,930
was trying to accomplish,
you would ask me.

2711
02:43:52,931 --> 02:43:57,931
But like when we had a couple hiccups
along the way and I just totally 100%

2712
02:44:00,011 --> 02:44:03,490
trusted her that she'd be able to take
care of it. And she did every single time.

2713
02:44:04,030 --> 02:44:08,750
And she, I'm sure I'm not
giving even enough credit.

2714
02:44:08,751 --> 02:44:11,000
I don't know. There's probably
a thousand things that she did,

2715
02:44:11,001 --> 02:44:15,350
I don't even know about yet. Um, but
I mean, I just, Oh, Hirsch, huge.

2716
02:44:15,680 --> 02:44:19,670
And then also my mom, same
thing, you know, just uh,

2717
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:25,240
being willing to withstand a
month in an RV with four people,

2718
02:44:25,521 --> 02:44:28,940
you know, and probably putting up with
me being grumpy or whatever, you know,

2719
02:44:28,941 --> 02:44:33,080
in pain and stuff. And I couldn't
even imagine having, you know,

2720
02:44:33,081 --> 02:44:36,080
two people along with me,
the that would have a,

2721
02:44:36,590 --> 02:44:39,470
made it better or that I
would have trusted as much.

2722
02:44:39,860 --> 02:44:41,630
And then also my buddy that drove a,

2723
02:44:42,050 --> 02:44:47,050
and then just all the people that kept
me going that ran with me and you know,

2724
02:44:47,601 --> 02:44:52,130
deemed me worthy of their time and
the people that sent me messages of

2725
02:44:52,131 --> 02:44:55,070
encouragement that couldn't make it out.
Um,

2726
02:44:55,400 --> 02:45:00,350
I just owe everybody a huge debt of
gratitude and I'm going to do my best to,

2727
02:45:00,351 --> 02:45:05,351
to continue to keep fighting and
earn that respect and earn that,

2728
02:45:07,040 --> 02:45:10,100
earn their effort or in their
sacrifices as much as I can.

2729
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:16,070
Awesome. Well obviously rob, it's an
honor to have you back on here again.

2730
02:45:16,430 --> 02:45:19,910
I look forward to whatever the hell
kind of crazy thing you do next.

2731
02:45:19,911 --> 02:45:22,400
I'm not sure what it's going to be,
but I'm sure it will be something awesome.

2732
02:45:22,850 --> 02:45:27,850
And of course thanks to everyone
for listening to this podcast.

2733
02:45:28,191 --> 02:45:33,140
Thanks to the service men and women
that are holding the line day and night,

2734
02:45:34,940 --> 02:45:35,900
day and night,

2735
02:45:37,670 --> 02:45:42,500
fighting against evil thanks to police,
law enforcement,

2736
02:45:42,501 --> 02:45:44,390
firefighters,
paramedics,

2737
02:45:44,720 --> 02:45:49,490
other first responders that are
always on call, always on call

2738
02:45:51,770 --> 02:45:53,720
to protect us here at home.

2739
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:57,650
And to everyone that's listening,

2740
02:45:58,280 --> 02:46:03,280
I want to refer to one last journal entry
that rob wrote and something that we

2741
02:46:05,571 --> 02:46:10,520
talked about the last time that he
was on that was using the weight.

2742
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:12,190
Okay.

2743
02:46:12,190 --> 02:46:16,280
Cause the way to the world
can be heavy.

2744
02:46:17,810 --> 02:46:22,810
The weight of the challenges and the
trials of life can drive you into the

2745
02:46:24,171 --> 02:46:25,004
ground

2746
02:46:27,160 --> 02:46:31,960
and that weight can wear
you down and break you.

2747
02:46:34,500 --> 02:46:38,220
But instead of letting
the weight where you down,

2748
02:46:39,690 --> 02:46:41,460
instead of letting the weight break you,

2749
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:45,540
you can use the weight to
make yourself stronger,

2750
02:46:48,040 --> 02:46:51,820
to make yourself tougher,
to make yourself better.

2751
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:58,540
And that is what I
recommend everyone does.

2752
02:47:00,220 --> 02:47:01,480
Just like rob says,

2753
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:05,800
use the weight.

2754
02:47:09,230 --> 02:47:11,960
Now,
get out there

2755
02:47:13,520 --> 02:47:17,180
and get after it.
And until next time,

2756
02:47:17,600 --> 02:47:21,620
this is Rob Jones and echo and Jocko

2757
02:47:23,310 --> 02:47:23,610
out.
