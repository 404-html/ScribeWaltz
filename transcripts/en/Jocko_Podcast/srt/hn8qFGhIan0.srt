1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:06,570
This is Jocko podcast number
81 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,050
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,040
November 29th,
1915

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,520
it has teamed
the trenches or ankle deep.

5
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,050
Some places calf deep in
mud and the communications
trenches are rushing streams

6
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,890
of brown water.

7
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,950
The men are wet through,

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,140
but stick the job like Britain's and
I hope for their sake that the weather

9
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:43,490
lifts with the morning.

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,590
But guns have been strafing today though.
Up Til now we have dodged the show.

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,670
It may be ours again tomorrow though

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,300
one never knows.

13
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
This is from the diary
of Captain Charlie May,

14
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:14,350
the British Army Officer Commander of B
Company 22nd Manchester Pals Battalion

15
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:22,130
of the Manchester Regiment
who served in World War One.

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,770
He was married to Bessie Mae

17
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,690
and they had one daughter
who was born July 20th,

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,743
1914

19
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,250
so she was a little over a year old
when this journal was being written

20
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:45,960
from the trenches

21
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,300
and it continues December 1st,
1915 it is exciting work.

22
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,060
Sniping in fact,

23
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,920
one must curb the tendency lest
it should become a fascination.

24
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,480
The second in command of the e Lance,

25
00:02:07,481 --> 00:02:11,710
the East Lanchester regimen and myself
putting a couple hours this morning and

26
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,980
had quite a bit of fun worrying
the batches in their trenches.

27
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,290
One fellow was walking across the open
2000 yards off when I spotted him and let

28
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:26,820
go. You never saw a chap
move quicker in your life.

29
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,170
Okay.

30
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,820
He ran for a tree and jumped behind
it and I let him have four more there.

31
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,370
Whether I got them or not,
I don't know,

32
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,190
but he didn't move for the next half hour.

33
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,620
I know because I waited
so anxiously for him

34
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,050
last night or rather one 30 this morning.

35
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,880
I got outside the barbed wire
and got lost three times.

36
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:57,250
I had to fling myself
down in the wet grass,

37
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,430
bury my nose in it and grovel while the
machine guns went chattering over me.

38
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,440
Yeah,

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,440
it is remarkable with what speed one
learns to adopt the prone position.

40
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,450
January 13th,
1916

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,790
I long and long to see you to clasp you
in my arms and I long with all my heart

42
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:31,400
to see my baby,
how I love her.

43
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,820
What hopes I have for her.

44
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,670
What a sweet girl she will make.

45
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,320
February 25th,

46
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,940
1916 woke up this morning to find the
snow pelting down and covering the ground

47
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:54,780
fully five inches deep.
Also,

48
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,970
it was freezing hard cotton. A fellow
officer came in to breakfast with us.

49
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:06,130
He brought the Little Bible which another
soldier had taken from the body of a

50
00:04:06,381 --> 00:04:07,214
dead German

51
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,370
on the fly leaf in a child's handwriting.

52
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,650
The word Dada

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,410
war is very sad.

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Perhaps the man may have done and
been something to loathe and detest.

55
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,940
I do not know.

56
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,400
All I am conscious of is that somewhere
in his father land there is a little

57
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:39,260
child who called Him Dad.
Dad.

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,793
Okay.

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,420
April 6th,

60
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,040
1916 fritz strafed our new trenches with
heavies and searched around the support

61
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,640
with hg shrapnel and other
such an obnoxious stuff.

62
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,170
Okay.

63
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,620
One shell claimed three
NCO and wounded three men.

64
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:08,600
We all feel wild to get at the beast
and I hope we may string them up on the

65
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,434
wire.

66
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,350
I saw the kill to go down the line.

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,750
It was a pitiful sight.
Poor boys.

68
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,000
Shell fire is a horrid thing.

69
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,310
Grasty a lad who was a
sergeant of mine was the worst.

70
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,770
His body full of gaping holes.

71
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,120
It was very,
very sad.

72
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,310
Do those at home realize how
their boys go out for them?

73
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,323
Yeah,

74
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,040
never can they do enough
for their soldiers?

75
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,800
Never can they repay the debt they owe.

76
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,390
Not that the men ask

77
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,223
any reward,

78
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,150
but one day we'll get
at him with the bayonet.

79
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,070
We'll take our price then for Gretzky.

80
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:10,780
Okay,

81
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,060
and all the other hundreds,

82
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,530
thousands Gretzky slain as they
were standing at their posts.

83
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,963
Okay.

84
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,620
June 17th,
1916

85
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,240
I do not want to die.

86
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,610
The fought that I may never see you or
are darling baby again turns my bowels to

87
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,204
water.

88
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:53,940
My conscience is clear that I've always
tried to make life a joy for you,

89
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,960
but it is the thought that our baby
may grow up without my knowing her and

90
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:07,110
without her knowing me.
I prayed,

91
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:11,220
God, I may do my duty for I
know whatever that may entail,

92
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,740
you would not have it otherwise.

93
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,750
June 23rd,

94
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,330
1916 everything is speeding up to no end.

95
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,010
Okay.

96
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,610
Ammunition by the hundred
wagon load is pouring up.

97
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,350
It should certainly not be for lack of
ammunition if we do not make us huge

98
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,970
success of the venture

99
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,730
yet one cannot help feeling
a little anxious and worried

100
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,700
so much depends on this great throw.

101
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,143
Yeah,

102
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,340
and what he's talking about there
in this part of the journal,

103
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,870
it reflects the buildup for
the battle of the Somme.

104
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,530
Yeah,

105
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,530
and although Charlie doesn't know exactly
when the battle is going to commence,

106
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,150
they're obviously only distributing that
information with people that have the

107
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:17,800
need to know. They know that
a major attack is forthcoming

108
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,530
then that's why they've got all that
ammunition piled up more than they could

109
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:25,510
ever think they could possibly need.

110
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,400
Back to the journal.
June 28th

111
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:32,990
okay.

112
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,370
1916

113
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,160
the moment seems very
auspicious for us to strike.

114
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,680
Perhaps we will on Friday.

115
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,463
Okay.

116
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,050
July 1st,
1916

117
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,290
we marched up to the
assembly trench last night.

118
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,200
The most exciting march imaginable.

119
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,790
Guns all around crashed
and roared till some times.

120
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,250
It was quite impossible
to hear oneself speak.

121
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,540
It was however a find site
and one realized from it
what gun power really means.

122
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Fritz of course strafed back and reply
causing us some uneasiness and a few

123
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,630
casualties before we
even reached the line.

124
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,910
The night past noisily and
with a few more casualties.

125
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,440
The Han puts a barrage on us every now
and then and generally claims one or two

126
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:41,980
victims.
It is a glorious morning.

127
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,190
We go over in two hours time.

128
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,570
It seems a long time to wait
and I think whatever happens,

129
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,230
we shall all feel relieved
once the line is launched.

130
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,210
No Man's land is a tangled
desert unless one could see it.

131
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,710
One cannot imagine what a terrible
state of disorder it is in,

132
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,330
but we do not yet seem to
have stopped the machine guns.

133
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,900
These are popping off all along
our pair of Pitt as I write.

134
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,250
Yeah,

135
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,810
I trust they will not claim to many
of our lads before the day is over.

136
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,740
Now I closed this old diary
down for the next few days.

137
00:10:33,741 --> 00:10:35,570
Since I may not take it into the line,

138
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:41,860
I will keep a record of how
things go and enter it up later.

139
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,370
Well, yeah, that update

140
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,550
never took place

141
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,640
and Charlie may was wrong about how
many British soldiers would be claimed

142
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:12,830
before the day was over. He didn't think
he would claim to many, but as you know,

143
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,600
the first day of the battle of the Somme,

144
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,690
July 1st turned out to be
the worst day in history

145
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,690
for the British army

146
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,300
and they suffered almost
60,000 casualties,

147
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,040
60,000 casualties in one day.

148
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,350
Then like I said,
those casualties included Charlie May,

149
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,810
who went over the top

150
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,950
on July 1st under the
cover of allied artillery.

151
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,700
He was leading B company
and he didn't.

152
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,400
His men fought their way
across no man's land.

153
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:03,670
And just as they reached German lines,
Charlie was a hit by shell fire.

154
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,320
They had killed

155
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,671
in his diary,

156
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:14,530
was found by the man that eventually
dragged him back to the trenches private

157
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,850
Arthur bunting

158
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,100
who mailed the diary
to Charlie's wife Maude

159
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,343
now,

160
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,450
or the British have a
steep military history

161
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:51,570
and obviously this is the kingdom that
we Americans rebelled against and the

162
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:55,290
revolutionary war. And we fought
them again in the war of 1812

163
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,700
yeah.

164
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,300
And we actually had a bunch
of other little various
disputes with them until the

165
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,860
late 18 hundreds

166
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,600
when during something called
the great reproachment. Yeah.

167
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:14,370
Through various forces in the world
are political objectives or aligned.

168
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:21,011
And we became the staunchest of allies
with Great Britain through World War One

169
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,910
and world war two and Korea and Vietnam.

170
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:28,850
And even up til now in
Iraq and Afghanistan.

171
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,700
And I've been lucky enough to work
alongside Brits on just a couple occasions

172
00:13:37,401 --> 00:13:38,930
while I was in the military.

173
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:45,730
And there's no doubt that they are
just outstanding troops professional in

174
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:52,490
everything that they do.
When they leave that impression on you,

175
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,500
you can actually feel the pride
of their military tradition.

176
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:08,010
And
tonight I wanted to take at a,

177
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,040
I look at a book that is part
of that military tradition

178
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,470
and the book is called

179
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,190
serve to lead.

180
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,990
And I'm going to start with some
statements from the introduction to this

181
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:29,860
version of the book.

182
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:33,100
And the version of the book that
I'm reading is the old version.

183
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:38,101
I think it's from 1954 or 57 originally
written right after World War Two and

184
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:45,301
these comments here are from
a guy named Robin Matthews,

185
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:47,530
a former British army officer,

186
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,100
graduate of the Royal Military Academy
of that's like the British west point.

187
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,280
He went on to command his regiment,
the light drag goons,

188
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,550
which included a tour of duty in Iraq in
2005 he also served with 16 air assault

189
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:08,120
brigade in Helmand
province in Afghanistan.

190
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,500
And here's what he has
to say about this book.

191
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:19,090
Serve to lead is a remarkable book
produced by the Royal Military Academy

192
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,280
Sandhurst.
After the Second World War.

193
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,590
It is as clear and concise a treaties
on leadership as you will find.

194
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,290
It also provides a fascinating glimpse
into what sets the profession of arms

195
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,580
apart from any other

196
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,410
serve to lead is synonymous with Sandhurst
placed on the bed of every officer

197
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,150
cadet at the beginning of
their military training.

198
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,500
Somewhere between prayer book,
which is what I fought,

199
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:56,760
it was initially and Bible as
it has often been referred,

200
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:02,090
it lays out what is expected and
what to expect on equivocally.

201
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,530
It establishes selflessness,
self discipline, integrity,

202
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,970
and duty as the bedrock of leadership.
Excitingly,

203
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,590
it speaks of courage and boldness as
the essential differentiators upon which

204
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:21,591
events turn and to which soldiers
and leaders are instinctively drawn.

205
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,970
There is so much to enjoy
and consider on every page,

206
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,430
but the most beguiling message
of the book concerns humility.

207
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,290
Okay.

208
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,030
Leadership must be confident,

209
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,240
but unless it is matched in
equal measure by humility,

210
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,890
it jars at which point
the lead simply fall away.

211
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,650
If I am to lead you, first and
foremost, I must be your servant.

212
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,200
Okay?

213
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,280
Like any good book, the clue
is in the title. In this case,

214
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,240
simple,
seemingly contradictory,

215
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,130
but ultimately profound serve to lead

216
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,830
and that's the intro to this book
and obviously there's a dichotomy of

217
00:17:10,831 --> 00:17:11,161
leadership.

218
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:16,161
He's already talking about things that
we talk about all the time and yes,

219
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,040
you've got to be confident but you've got
to be humble and the title of the book

220
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,640
is a contradictory is a dichotomy
in its own sense, right?

221
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:28,350
Serve to lead. No, and like I said,

222
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:32,070
this book, they actually have a
new one. Then I have the new one.

223
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,400
I went with the old one and the
reason I went with the old one,

224
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:36,530
there's a couple of things
that we're going to play.

225
00:17:36,531 --> 00:17:41,531
I'm going to point out that clearly
they've changed their faults on and maybe

226
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,850
we'll end up doing a compare
and contrast with the new one.

227
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,530
There aren't that many differences,

228
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:50,190
but there certainly are some
very significant different
differences and we'll

229
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,150
get to those

230
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,710
and this is going to kick off with a a
piece from the Lord Bishop of Durham.

231
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,840
It is the fact that some men possess an
inbred superiority which gives them a

232
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:10,530
dominating influence over their
contemporaries and marks them out.

233
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,390
Unmistakably for leadership.

234
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,220
This phenomenon is as
certain as it is mysterious.

235
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,360
It is apparent in every association
of human beings in every variety of

236
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:26,361
circumstances and on every plane
of culture in a school among boys,

237
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,500
in a college among the
students in a factory ship
yard or mine among the workman

238
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,560
as certainly as in the
church and in the nation,

239
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,650
there are those who with an assured
and unquestioned title take the leading

240
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:43,470
place and shape the general conduct.

241
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,450
So there's an opinion and people ask
all the time, are leaders born or made?

242
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,550
That one right there is,
hey, leaders are born

243
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,030
and that's I, I always say
both. I always say there's,

244
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,750
there's certain leadership qualities
that people are born with and some people

245
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:04,710
are born with a lot of them. Some people
are vulnerable, all of those qualities.

246
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,860
Some people are born with a lot less,
some people aren't born with any,

247
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,050
they're not going to be much of a leader.

248
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,780
He doesn't matter how much you train them.
You can get them better,

249
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:17,160
but they're not going to be a
great leader and obviously some,

250
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:20,030
some leaders don't need much training.
Uh,

251
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,950
there's very few of those
leaders that just don't,

252
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,740
they just get it out of the
gate as just born that way.

253
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,690
I think it's a mixture of both and I
think you're born with some leadership

254
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:34,260
capability and the more you hone it,
the more you work on it,

255
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,280
the better you're going to be.

256
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,560
Why would you think or
why do you think that is?

257
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,690
Because to be a leader,
like the good,

258
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:46,980
strong qualities that you got to have
or still contradict or counterintuitive,

259
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:51,210
they're not even counterintuitive, but
the, you can get better at all of them.

260
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,200
You know, a couple, the
one that's, for instance,

261
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,890
some people are naturally talented or
some people are naturally articulate

262
00:19:58,891 --> 00:19:59,724
people,

263
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,350
so they're able to get their
message across in simple, clear,

264
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:08,460
concise language. That's very important.
Now, if you're born with that,

265
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,370
you're lucky, right? Good
job. You are born with that.

266
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:14,190
You were born in articulate
person. If you weren't, guess what?

267
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,990
You're going to have to work at it.
You're going to have to read,

268
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:17,070
you have to write,
you have to listen,

269
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,910
you have to practice speaking to
people and you will get better at it.

270
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,190
So those, that's your example. Some
people just have it naturally and,

271
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,120
but even people that have it naturally,
we'll get better at it over time.

272
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,670
I was always pretty
comfortable speaking to people,

273
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,820
but obviously when I was in the military,
I spoke to people all the time.

274
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,380
And when I was in a training training
situation as a young enlisted seal,

275
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,800
I was put up in front of classroom to
speak to people and I got better at it.

276
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,740
And then when I became an officer and
a leader now I was briefing people.

277
00:20:47,741 --> 00:20:49,030
And so I'm doing it even more.

278
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,780
And then I took over the training for
the west coast seals and now I was

279
00:20:52,781 --> 00:20:55,870
briefing people all the time. And, and
when I was overseas, I was briefing,

280
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,740
you know, colonels and generals and okay,
you're going to brief a bunch of times,

281
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,210
you're going to get better at it.
I was already okay at it just naturally,

282
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,060
but I got better at it and I'm
still getting better at it today.

283
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,280
So that's the same with any of
these particular talents, you know,

284
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,190
being able to simplify things,
being able to detach.

285
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,960
Those are all important
leadership qualities.

286
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,680
You can have a certain level
that you're capable at,

287
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,340
but the more you practice them, the
better off you're going to be. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,510
So it's a combination. Yeah. So
we'll have you say like there's,

289
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,480
it's pretty rare that you get
somebody who's, um, you know,

290
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,140
just has all the qualities right
out the gate. Yeah, no, I see.

291
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,450
I've never met anybody that just,
just dominates.

292
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:44,260
And every category like detaching
for example, that's not,

293
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:48,310
that's kind of counter to
your natural way. That's true.

294
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,590
Most people are going to want
to get in there for sure.

295
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,940
Now I just thought of this example.
I've talked about him a little bit on the,

296
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,450
on the podcast where we had Tim Ferriss
on all the lead Grizzard he was, uh,

297
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,973
he was the,

298
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,390
he was my assistant platoon commander
when I was at seal team one and he got

299
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:08,650
murdered. It was horrible, tragic
situation. He was involved in a murder,

300
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:13,360
suicide and, but he, he had
a lot of those capabilities.

301
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:15,760
He had a lot,
like he was articulate,

302
00:22:15,761 --> 00:22:17,950
he was the quarterback at
the navy football team.

303
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,820
So we had like a real good
presence to him. He spoke clearly,

304
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,600
he was down to earth
and yet, you know, very,

305
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,740
he could elevate himself very quickly
when there's talking to them, you know,

306
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,920
if he needed to elevate himself.

307
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:33,670
He just had a lot of those
qualities very naturally. And,

308
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:37,480
and guess what, he was at the
Naval Academy, he played football.

309
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,560
He was constantly getting in front of,
you know,

310
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,710
getting in the huddle and telling
guys what was going to happen.

311
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:44,970
And you get good at that over time.
And part of that is so,

312
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,791
I don't know how much of it,
you know,

313
00:22:45,791 --> 00:22:48,910
I didn't know him when he was a football
player when he was in eighth grade,

314
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,900
maybe he was stammering and trying
to put his thoughts together,

315
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:55,390
but then he trained it over and over
and over again. And he got better at it.

316
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:59,890
And maybe by the time he got to
me as a 23 year old lieutenant Jg,

317
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,050
he was like, oh, we're
going to get in a huddle.

318
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:05,380
I'll tell you guys what's
going on. And so, you know,

319
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,960
even though it appeared to me like
it was natural, probably wasn't,

320
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,240
it was probably trained, you know,
he had some national capability,

321
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:14,780
but he played football his whole
life. And that was that. Yeah. So in,

322
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,690
in a way you can kind of,

323
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,740
and this may be kind of interchangeable
as far as the expression, but you know,

324
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,550
you say natural capability.

325
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,660
It could be that they gain it
through learning or whatever,

326
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:29,130
just through their environment, you
know, like as a kid, you know? Yeah.

327
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:32,560
So playing football and then they'll
bring it to the training situation and

328
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:36,790
they'll excel. But I think it's
gotta be a little bit of both. Right.

329
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,810
And you will get better at it, but the
more you focus on that particular skill,

330
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,440
like some people aren't very
comfortable talking in, in, you know,

331
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:48,320
even they're not even comfortable talking
in a conversation. Right? Oh yeah. Yeah.

332
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,090
And so if you end up with a kid like that,

333
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,430
well you got to get 'em out and
socialize them and get them in,

334
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,170
get them in front of people talking all
the time. And that will be good for them.

335
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah. If you have someone that's,
uh, if you've got a kid or, yeah,

336
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:06,170
if you've got a kid or a young leader
that doesn't know when to shut up,

337
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,020
right. How are you going to, cause
sometimes leaders are like that too.

338
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:11,510
They want to hear themselves talk and
they just keep talking all the time.

339
00:24:11,511 --> 00:24:13,460
And guess what? The more you
talk, the less people listen.

340
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,150
So if I'm giving orders on every little
thing that we've gotten to do in front

341
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,800
of us, eventually you're
not listening to me anymore.

342
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,480
And when something critical comes up,

343
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,500
you're still not listening to me cause
I've been talking for the past six

344
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,820
straight months won't shut my pie hole.
So that's a bad situation.

345
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,920
So how do we get that
person to quiet down?

346
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,550
It's both. Yeah. All right.

347
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:42,790
So now we're going to hear from a
guy named Field Marshal William Slim.

348
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,780
I think bill slam is what
they ended up calling him.

349
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:47,370
And he was in World War
One and World War II

350
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,330
wounded multiple times,

351
00:24:51,331 --> 00:24:56,220
I think three times led the 14th
army in Burma and World War II.

352
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,450
And he also fought with the Anzac.
So the,

353
00:25:01,451 --> 00:25:04,440
the Australia New Zealand
Army Corps at [inaudible].

354
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,840
So you could say he's got a pretty good

355
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,200
view of things. Sure. So
he's this, believe it or not,

356
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:17,760
the first this, this book kicks
off with talking about morale

357
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,630
and the morale of the troops.
So here we go.

358
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,820
Back to the book morale
as a state of mind,

359
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,160
it is that intangible force which will
move a whole group of men to give their

360
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:34,161
last ounce to achieve something
without counting the cost to themselves

361
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,800
that makes them feel that they are part
of something greater than themselves.

362
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,710
Now this is interesting. So, so he's
talking about the importance of morale.

363
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:49,200
Now going back to the subject
we were just talking about,

364
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,160
back to the book I learned too,

365
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,630
that one did not need to be
in order to be effective,

366
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,900
two things only were necessary.

367
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,930
First to know what you were talking
about and second and most important to

368
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:10,590
believe it yourself.
So there you go.

369
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,780
You don't need to be great orator,

370
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:17,070
but you gotta know what you're talking
about and you've got to believe it. Yeah,

371
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,160
those are two really good places to start.

372
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,320
He continues on talking about morale.

373
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:30,321
He says up a most potent
factor in spreading this
belief in the efficiency of an

374
00:26:30,451 --> 00:26:32,610
organization is a sense of discipline.

375
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,150
We tried to make our
discipline intelligent,

376
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,410
but we were old fashioned army
and we insisted on outward signs.

377
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,280
We expected soldiers to salute
and officers salute in return,

378
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,980
both in mutual confidence and respect.

379
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,400
I encouraged all officers
to insist whenever possible,

380
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,580
and there were few places where it was
not possible on good turnout and personal

381
00:26:56,371 --> 00:26:58,500
cleanliness.
It takes courage,

382
00:26:58,501 --> 00:27:02,160
especially for a young officer to check
a man met on the road for not properly

383
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,580
saluting or for slovenly appearance,

384
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,590
but every time he does it adds to his
stock of moral courage and whatever the

385
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:15,360
soldier may say he has respect for
the officer who does pull him up.

386
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,280
Now this is an interesting point, right?
Because what we're talking about here is,

387
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:23,160
oh, I see echos, you know, not
wearing his uniform correctly,

388
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:24,510
so I'm going to go over
and tighten you up.

389
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,860
That is, you can see where you can see
where people are probably thinking, yeah,

390
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:36,630
Joc will be all over that guy,
right? No, actually wrong. That's a,

391
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,321
that's actually wrong.

392
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,280
And what we're going to talk about here
is I'm going to talk about what I called

393
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,790
leadership capital.

394
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,480
You only have so much leadership capital
in your bank and you've got to decide

395
00:27:48,211 --> 00:27:51,240
what as a leader,
you're going to spend that capital on.

396
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:55,410
And if I see you out of uniform
or you're looking sloppy,

397
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,600
I've got to decide if it's worth me
investing my leadership capital and going

398
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,820
over and telling you that you
need to tighten it up. Hey Echo,

399
00:28:02,821 --> 00:28:06,150
you need to get that.
Hey, Sergeant Charles,

400
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,370
you need to get your uniform squared away.
You look like crap.

401
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:09,420
You're setting a bad example.

402
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,410
Is that what I want to invest
my leadership capital on
now? Can it be sometimes?

403
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:17,280
Yes, absolutely. And we've
talked about the many cases
where that occurs. You know,

404
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,360
when you look at at Hackworth,

405
00:28:19,361 --> 00:28:22,020
when hack words showed up to
Vietnam as a battalion commander,

406
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,720
he tightened up their uniform
standards immediately.

407
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,240
He tightened them up immediately.

408
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,570
He knew he needed to invest
that leadership capital.

409
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,100
He needed to start with a small things.

410
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,640
But if you're in a garrison situation
and you see somebody that maybe isn't

411
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,830
doing there,

412
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,800
isn't wearing their uniform properly and
you decide you're going go tighten them

413
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:48,270
up, I'm not, I'm not saying it's the wrong
answer. And as Leif Babin will tell you,

414
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,980
it's not what you preach.
It's what you tolerate.

415
00:28:49,981 --> 00:28:51,990
And so if you tolerate the
guy's looking like crap,

416
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,930
they're just going to continue going
down that hill of looking like crap.

417
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,250
Now to me, there's a certain point, right,

418
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,790
that I won't let you go past
if you're a little out of the,

419
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,350
out of the standard made me, I'm going to
let that one slide a little bit, right?

420
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,860
But once you get to a point where you're
looking like crap, well guess what?

421
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,250
I am absolutely going to tighten you up
and I'm gonna explain to you why it's

422
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:18,030
important. I'm just going to go
and yell at you. No, not happening.

423
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,460
So you've got to be careful
how you ration your,

424
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,850
your discipline and your
leadership capital, right?

425
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,940
If you just run around yelling at
everyone or getting in everyone's face for

426
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:33,630
every little thing that they're doing.
Pretty soon you could look at that like,

427
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:37,530
well pretty soon they'll have, they'll be
scared of making a mistake. But that's,

428
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,280
that's the point.

429
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,430
Now you've got people that are scared of
making a mistake now cutting off their

430
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,490
ability to end their
desire to think freely.

431
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:48,820
So the bottom line with this balance,

432
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,960
you got to stay balanced in these things
and don't waste your leadership capital.

433
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,950
I was talking to a guy the other day,

434
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:59,280
he was running a offsite for his
executive team and I talked to him and,

435
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:06,220
and he said, man, you know, it was just
junk. And I said, well, what happened?

436
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,300
And he had showed up to the executive
offsite and he's in the company and he's

437
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:15,730
the guy that's running the off
site and he gets there and he says,

438
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:18,490
all right guys, now while
we're here, no cell phones.

439
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,450
So everyone put your cell phones away.
We need to focus this a strategic meeting.

440
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,770
We need to,
we need to get this done.

441
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,930
So the guys put their cell phones
away and they start the meeting. He's,

442
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:33,470
he says five minutes into the meeting,
the CEO breaks out a cell phone,

443
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,360
starts looking at it a minute after
everyone sees that you got half the room

444
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:42,130
looking at their cell phones and he
went like, got kind of nuts on them,

445
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,320
you know, this is man,
what's what's going on?

446
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,430
And people aren't even
paying attention to.

447
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,430
After the first at first hour he
said this, you know what's going on?

448
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,010
And I said to him, I said, Bro, let's
look at what you just so then he said,

449
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,660
then he lost them. Like the, the meeting
just went downhill. And I said to him,

450
00:30:58,661 --> 00:31:03,661
let's talk about what you did because
you invested your leadership capital for

451
00:31:04,181 --> 00:31:07,930
this important meeting on telling
people to not use their cell phones.

452
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,260
Did you tell him why?
He's like, not really.

453
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,490
Did you explain to them when they would
be able to use their cell phones? No,

454
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,140
I didn't.
So you just went,

455
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,060
now this company is a financial company.
They've got a lot of things going on.

456
00:31:22,061 --> 00:31:25,180
You can imagine the CEO of a big
financial companies got a lot of important

457
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,430
calls and emails to check and all that.

458
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,040
And all of a sudden he gets told no
cell phone. What does that going to end?

459
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,330
What important thing is happening at my
company today where I'm not allowed to

460
00:31:34,331 --> 00:31:36,400
talk on my cell phone and
answer emails or look at,

461
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:41,080
look at my emails and I'm the
guy. So, so when am I supposed to,

462
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,390
when would I be able to look at it?
You didn't tell me that.

463
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,500
So he invested all of his leadership
capital to get people to do no cell phones

464
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,930
and he spent it and there wasn't
any left and, and the, you know,

465
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:57,310
so you have to be careful. Now you have
to approach it the right way, right?

466
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,080
First of all, you could
say, hey listen guys,

467
00:31:59,081 --> 00:32:02,830
we're going to power through a solid
hour right now. I'm going to ask you,

468
00:32:02,831 --> 00:32:04,180
unless it's just critical,

469
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,900
keep your cell phones put away
and let's power through this.

470
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:09,530
Let's get some good
conversation going. Right? And,

471
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:12,250
and in an hour we're going to take a 20
minute break where you can catch up when

472
00:32:12,251 --> 00:32:15,340
you got to catch up on,
and then we'll do another hour after that.

473
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:18,340
So now people understand what's
happening and they understand why. I'm,

474
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:20,320
by the way, you know, if we, if
everyone's on their cell phones,

475
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:21,670
we're not going to get what
we need out of this meeting.

476
00:32:21,671 --> 00:32:24,850
So you've got to explain and you don't
want to invest your leadership capital on

477
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:25,684
things that don't matter.

478
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,220
So if you're the senior guy
in a leadership position
and you're focused on some

479
00:32:30,221 --> 00:32:34,240
little person that's out of uniform,
and that's what your focus is,

480
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,660
that's, that's not a good
focus to have, right? Yeah.

481
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,990
You should set the standard and your
subordinate leadership all the way down to

482
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:47,780
the front where you've got like you
and me, our peers, and I don't let you,

483
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,160
I'm the one not,

484
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,380
I'm not waiting for the boss to
come by and tighten up your uniform.

485
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,040
I won't let you tighten up. I won't
let you wear a crappy looking uniform.

486
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,330
That's what I want.

487
00:32:56,331 --> 00:33:01,040
I want to have a gang mentality where
we're self policing because the minute I'm

488
00:33:01,041 --> 00:33:04,310
from the top doing that again,
does this happen sometimes? Yes.

489
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,300
I'm not setting out a, a black
and white rule here. Yeah.

490
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,670
I'm giving the broad guidance that if
you're Hackworth and you're taking over

491
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,800
battalion where people's lives are at
risks and you know that there's slack

492
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,570
everywhere and they're
not doing a good job,

493
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,070
you got to go in there
and tighten them up.

494
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:21,410
And one of the best ways to do that is
to go in there and start on the small

495
00:33:21,411 --> 00:33:22,244
things.

496
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,890
But if you've got a functioning unit that
there's nothing critical happening and

497
00:33:27,891 --> 00:33:31,120
you're trying to build that team
into something that's, that's, uh,

498
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,330
a winning team and the first thing you
could do is go in and focus on some of

499
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:38,750
these small things when you haven't
really established yourself,

500
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,000
that could be problematic.

501
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:46,010
So think about those things
when you're in those positions.

502
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,320
Alright.
Going back to the book,

503
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,610
I do not say that the men of the
14th army welcomed at difficulties,

504
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,380
but they grew to take fierce pride
in overcoming them by determination.

505
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:03,200
Any ingenuity from start to finish,

506
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,750
they had only two items of equipment
that were never in short supply their

507
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:10,640
brains and their courage.

508
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,540
They lived up to the
unofficial motto I gave them.

509
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,570
God helps those who help themselves.

510
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,540
Okay.

511
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,190
Handle. Once again, that's the same
thing that colonel bill reader said,

512
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:28,830
got to help yourself right now we're
going to move on to still still talking

513
00:34:28,831 --> 00:34:29,700
about morale.

514
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,820
We're going to talk to or to hear
from Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.

515
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,030
If you don't know who that
is. Monte World War One,

516
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,640
the Anglo Irish war,

517
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,760
the Palestine conflicts that
disbar uprisings and World War II.

518
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,363
He,

519
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,930
you know, obviously ran the British Eighth
Army World War II. So we've, once again,

520
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:03,640
we've got a person with some very solid
perspective on leadership and combat

521
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:07,330
leadership. The quality of
morale back to the book. In war,

522
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,780
the moral stature of some men increases
and their characters grow stronger and

523
00:35:13,691 --> 00:35:17,350
more closely knit in proportion
to the discomforts and dangers.

524
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,190
They are called upon to face.
Boom. So some guys get better.

525
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,070
Some guys rise to the
occasion back to the book.

526
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,470
Such men will occasionally
perform in battle.

527
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:30,340
Remarkable acts of selfless courage
and daring and will endure with

528
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,200
extraordinary fortitude and patience,
the burdens frost upon them,

529
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,430
other men.
However,

530
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,700
we'll under the stress of hardships or
dangerous surrender to fear or fatigue

531
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,010
and allow their characters
to disintegrate.

532
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
This disintegration,

533
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:53,400
we'll usually take the form of
a loosening of the moral fiber,

534
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,780
which results in timidity of
Action and slackness in appearance.

535
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,960
While those who have gone to seed will
be dirty and their appearance will be

536
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:08,511
sluggish and we'll be
slovenly in these later cases.

537
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,180
There has been a general
loosening of character due
to partial surrender to fear.

538
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,040
So I totally agree with this.
You see,

539
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,580
in combat situations,

540
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:27,960
people either get better
or they get worse.

541
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,220
Some people just kind of cruise
right, stay in that same zone, but,

542
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,710
but some people they get better when they
get worse. They rise to the occasion,

543
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:37,680
know where they fall back to the book.
The good soldier,

544
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,270
the man with high morale has not
surrendered to fear and has maintained his

545
00:36:42,271 --> 00:36:45,270
personal standards.
The bad soldier,

546
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:50,420
the man with low morale has become
incapable of independent action and has to

547
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:55,590
some extent shed a part of
his human individuality.

548
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,230
That's an interesting,

549
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,150
that's an interesting statement that the
person that's incapable of independent

550
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:07,260
action, he saying he shed some
of his human individuality.

551
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,280
Back to the book.
Basic factors of morale.

552
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:16,180
We now must considered
the factors con what?

553
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,420
What factors constitute morale of
the soldier in the heat of battle?

554
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,410
Certain factors may be described as
essential conditions without which high

555
00:37:23,411 --> 00:37:24,940
morale cannot exist.

556
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,590
These four basic factors are one,

557
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,970
leadership to discipline,
three,

558
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,870
comradeship and for self respect.

559
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,370
A fifth factor,

560
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:44,371
devotion to cause must exist but need
not necessarily influenced all the

561
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,630
soldiers.
Finally,

562
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:51,550
there are numerous contributory factors
which are of great importance but are

563
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:54,670
not essential conditions.
Starting with this first one.

564
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:58,300
Leadership morale is in the
first place based on leadership.

565
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,230
Good morale is impossible
without good leaders.

566
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:06,760
Human beings are fundamentally a lichen
that certain common characteristics

567
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:10,690
apply to all men in
varying degrees in battle.

568
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:13,990
The most important of these
characteristics is fear.

569
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,570
All men are afraid at one time or
another to a greater or lesser extent.

570
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,550
In moments of fear,
they band together and look for guidance.

571
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:29,950
They seek for a person to give decisions.
They look for a leader,

572
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,133
okay?

573
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,220
The leaders power

574
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,220
of decision results from his ability
to remain calm in the crisis.

575
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,540
His greatest asset is the ability to
act normally in abnormal conditions,

576
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:53,200
to continue to think rationally
when his men have ceased to think,

577
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,440
to be decisive in action when
they are paralyzed by fear,

578
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:03,230
a little bit of normal face from Monte
abnormally in abnormal conditions remain

579
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:06,874
calm

580
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:09,843
back to the book.

581
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,880
The object of training must be first
to select those who possess them within

582
00:39:15,071 --> 00:39:17,860
them. The potentiality is
of leadership and secondly,

583
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,690
to develop these potential realities.

584
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:23,470
This is accomplished by giving
the leader responsibility.

585
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,980
The leader's character will develop in
proportion to the responsibility with

586
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:30,190
which he has been entrusted.
Trusted. So there you go.

587
00:39:30,191 --> 00:39:32,230
He's saying the same thing that we
just were talking about earlier.

588
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,250
You have certain potentials
and you got to develop those.

589
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,520
And how do you develop them with people?
You give people,

590
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,290
you want to develop leaders,
you give him responsibility.

591
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,320
You don't give him responsibility
that's going to kill them,

592
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,540
but you give him responsibility that's
gonna definitely test them and they're

593
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:52,750
going to have to step
up to be able to perform

594
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:55,541
back to the book.

595
00:39:55,541 --> 00:40:00,160
That two vital attributes
of a leader are a decision,

596
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,940
inaction and be calmness in crisis.

597
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,590
Given these two attributes of
key will succeed without them,

598
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,820
he will fail our great problem
in pieces to select leaders.

599
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,620
It's just select as leaders,

600
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,060
men whose brain will remain
clear when intensely frightened.

601
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,950
So from Monte, you gotta remain calm. Hmm.

602
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,080
Now he's going to talk about discipline.

603
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,260
The object of discipline
is the conquest of fear.

604
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,320
There are two aspects of fear.

605
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,380
Fear can suddenly attack a
man through his imagination,

606
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,230
a corpse in a ditch or a grave.

607
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:45,710
By the SARC far side of the road
will remind him of his position.

608
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,700
He will suddenly realize that he
himself is liable to be killed.

609
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:53,720
It is a function of discipline to fortify
the mind so that'd becomes reconciled

610
00:40:53,721 --> 00:40:58,340
to unpleasant sites and accepts
them as normal everyday occurrences.

611
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,850
Fear can also creep upon a man during
periods of monotony on the line.

612
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:05,411
At such time,

613
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:10,210
he will have the opportunity to appreciate
the dangers which beset his life.

614
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,580
Fear acting through his thoughts can
so reduce the man's hardcore of courage

615
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,590
that he will become nervous and fearful.

616
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:23,110
Discipline strengthens the mind so that
it becomes impervious to the corroding

617
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,160
influence of fear.

618
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,740
It teaches men to confine their
fought within certain definite limits.

619
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,810
You didn't steals the habit of self
control. That's pretty amazing.

620
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,260
It's pretty amazing assessment to think
that the one of the best premier tools

621
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:44,290
to overcome fear as discipline.
Hmm.

622
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:51,500
Back to the book.
Discipline implies a conception of duty.

623
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,610
Nothing will be accomplished in the
crisis by the man without a sense of duty.

624
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,020
Makes Sense. Now he's going to talk
about comradeship. Back to the book.

625
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:05,200
Morale can not be good unless men
come to have affection for each other.

626
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:08,840
A fellow feeling must grow up,

627
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:11,270
which will result in a
spirit of comradeship.

628
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,200
And Army is made of human beings so that
however much a leader may inspire as

629
00:42:17,571 --> 00:42:19,730
men,
however perfect the discipline,

630
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,880
the morale will be hard and unsympathetic
if the warmth of comradeship has not

631
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,700
been added.
Oh yeah,

632
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:32,980
you gotta be,
you gotta be the hardcore disciplinarian,

633
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,250
but you need the warmth of comradeship.

634
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:41,310
Back to the book war though hard
business is not necessarily a grim one.

635
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,820
Men must laugh and joke together,
must enjoy each other's company,

636
00:42:48,850 --> 00:42:53,850
company and must get fun out of even life.

637
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:58,450
I must get fun out of life
even in times of danger.

638
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,170
So do you want to have a good time?

639
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,390
Yes you do.

640
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,230
And the thing that makes these dangerous
times more bearable is when you're

641
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:13,790
having fun during them.
And that's one of the things that you're,

642
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,590
I don't talk a whole lot about seal
training in here on the podcast,

643
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:19,990
but one of the things that you do in
seal training is you're doing miserable

644
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:24,400
things cold, wet, tired. And you're having
fun the whole time you're learning that,

645
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:27,610
hey, guess what? I can sit here
and be cold and it's miserable.

646
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,900
Or I can be cold and I can laugh about
it and I can make fun of my friend.

647
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:35,770
The way he's shivering.
That's what makes it bearable.

648
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,630
And the same thing happens when you get
overseas and you joke about really dark

649
00:43:40,631 --> 00:43:41,291
things,
you know,

650
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:46,000
dark sense of humor that comes out
real strong when you're overseas.

651
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,110
And one of my,
one of my buddies who was super paranoid,

652
00:43:50,111 --> 00:43:52,870
I've talked about them
on here before the guys,

653
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:58,650
the guys found a tube that had
shipped like maps or something.

654
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,630
And if you pulled the
tube apart real fast,

655
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:03,860
it sounded like a mortar
law of mortar launch.

656
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,550
And so they'd get outside is 10
and he was super paranoid. We,

657
00:44:06,551 --> 00:44:10,960
we spent a little bit of time getting
mortared and so he was a little on edge

658
00:44:10,961 --> 00:44:14,380
from that. Yeah. So they'd go
outside of his tent, you know,

659
00:44:14,381 --> 00:44:16,750
and you can hear through the 10 it's
just a little piece of fabric and they go

660
00:44:16,751 --> 00:44:19,390
outside of his tent and they'd pull that
thing and it would sound like a mortar

661
00:44:19,391 --> 00:44:23,530
through Qut freaky, you know,

662
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:25,870
what the hell are you cross doing?
Or you know,

663
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:29,920
at first you hear him like fall and like
say hit the ground and then you'd hear

664
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,870
the giggling of the guys and then
you'd hear him cussing everyone out.

665
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:39,030
But uh, yeah, but it was fun. It was
funny too far. A little too far maybe.

666
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,580
But everyone's having a good
time and even him, you know,

667
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,710
we'd get done and he
would be come outside,

668
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:45,450
you guys are bastards
and we'd laugh about it.

669
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,580
That's the kind of thing where you're,

670
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,470
you've got to have fun in these tough
situations. Yeah, that makes sense.

671
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,780
That's probably why, you know, like
nowadays, like Contemporary Company,

672
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:02,370
they in court, like Jade's company,
frack mom, take up foosball,

673
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,170
ping pains.
I heard,

674
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:09,171
I heard massive noises of the other day
and I was kind of sounded like like a

675
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:11,940
mortar fire and wasn't quite mortar fire,
but there was something,

676
00:45:11,941 --> 00:45:13,680
I didn't know what it was and they were,
they were in a,

677
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:17,970
in a nerf gun firefighters.
And by the way,

678
00:45:17,971 --> 00:45:20,930
it was sloppy. Like no one knew
what they were doing. Yeah.

679
00:45:20,931 --> 00:45:24,030
There was no cover and move happening.
It was just all, every man for himself.

680
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,270
I was pretty disappointed. What
the fuck? The reason, right.

681
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:33,360
Where it's not, I mean these are, I
mean conceptually it's the same thing.

682
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,510
Obviously it's way different.
It's way different,

683
00:45:36,511 --> 00:45:39,600
but it's not actually not right when
you're going through tough things in a

684
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:41,580
business and our company,
we have fun with it.

685
00:45:41,581 --> 00:45:43,500
And when I work with
companies that are good,

686
00:45:43,501 --> 00:45:46,380
good companies and they're
going through something tough,

687
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,990
the ones that have good morale,
the ones that are laughing,

688
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,280
they're the ones that do better.

689
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,790
Who wants to go to work if you don't
enjoy the people you work with, you know,

690
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,320
like why would you want to do that?
You know, one of the, one of the, uh,

691
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:03,270
I hate even calling it the worst job,
but I was the animal's age, right?

692
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:06,870
So every day I'm wearing a uniform,
I'm in sitting at a desk all day.

693
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:11,640
I did it for 13 months. It was
just that part of it. It's,

694
00:46:11,641 --> 00:46:15,630
it's, you know, even it's just
a miserable job. Right. Luckily,

695
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:19,030
first of all, the animal is a great
guy and I had a lot of, you know, we,

696
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:24,180
I joked around all the time with him and
his executive assistant is a guy that I

697
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:26,370
would literally not,

698
00:46:26,371 --> 00:46:30,870
I would go two or three weeks at a time
and we wouldn't say one serious thing to

699
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:35,700
each other. I just, everything
would be some joke about every,

700
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:38,960
all the misery that we were going through
and my misery. I just mean, you know,

701
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:43,380
hours worth of meetings and traveling all
the time and he'd been on the road and

702
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:47,850
staying and crappy hotels and flights
getting bumped and canceled and being held

703
00:46:47,851 --> 00:46:50,370
over in the,
the animals suitcase,

704
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:52,470
not showing up somewhere and
he's supposed to go on stage.

705
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:56,220
It doesn't have a uniform with them.
And like that's, you know, not fun.

706
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,270
But guess what I had found the whole
time and we'd be joking about, you know,

707
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,370
I'd say,
well I guess I'm going to get take,

708
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,880
take one and again for the team
and we'd be just laughing. So yeah,

709
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:09,510
even in these situations that aren't
fun at have you gotta have fun with them

710
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:11,580
and that definitely will
help out your morale.

711
00:47:11,581 --> 00:47:15,570
And if you're in a leadership position and
all you do is just bare, you know, get,

712
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:18,270
get drown in the misery
that you're going through.

713
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,450
Every single person that's with you is
going to be going through the same thing.

714
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:24,390
And so as a leader you got to,
once again,

715
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,990
going back to the dichotomy of leadership,
you gotta have, you gotta know when,

716
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:31,780
okay, the guys were under too
stress. They're not having
fun. I need to have fun.

717
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:35,800
I need to start a nerf war in the,
in the office here.

718
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:39,490
So guys loosen up and then there's times
where hey guys are having too much fun.

719
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:42,400
We got to tighten them up. Yeah, yeah.
Like, hey guys, we got this to do.

720
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,800
And so you got to ride that, that line
in balance it out correctly. Yeah.

721
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:47,790
Yeah.
It's cool.

722
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:52,790
Hall like newer companies that were
companies nowadays there are incorporating

723
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:57,970
that element into the, the
actual co, you know you're right.

724
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,450
And there's companies nowadays that do
it too much and all of a sudden they

725
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:02,261
can't get anything done.

726
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:04,900
Yeah they're messing around because
everyone's playing ping pong. Right.

727
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:08,070
Everyone's in the Lego room cause they
got rooms now where it's like oh you

728
00:48:08,071 --> 00:48:11,680
could go in there and think and do play
with legos cause that relaxes your mind

729
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,650
I guess. Not me when I'm around lake
goes I think I'm going to step on them.

730
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,690
Sorry cause I got kids stepped on late.
Legos is a nightmare.

731
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,040
So I don't like being around Legos.

732
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,060
I got the PTSD from Lego stepping when
I was glad my kids were younger. Lego,

733
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,330
you know, cause you can't ever get your
son enough legos apparently. Correct.

734
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,430
Cause they just need everything.

735
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:33,760
And when I was a kid there was not
that many different types of Legos.

736
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:37,900
You had blocks,
long ones and shorter ones.

737
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:43,090
Nowadays you get Lego's but they have
hands and horderves and machine guns and

738
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,370
they got cool stuff but
they ain't Lego's anymore.

739
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,030
They're little toys but they still come
with the little legos and they still

740
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:53,560
hurt the bottom stuff on.
They are surprisingly sharp for kids.

741
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:57,310
Made your choice major sharp.
All right,

742
00:48:58,450 --> 00:48:59,380
going back to the book,

743
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,980
he's the other thing you talked about
self respect and no man can be said to

744
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:07,570
possess high morale if the quality of
self respect is lacking and this is

745
00:49:07,571 --> 00:49:09,010
something that Dick
Winters talked about too,

746
00:49:09,011 --> 00:49:11,680
that self respect and
and how that drove him.

747
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:15,850
Soldiers must be encouraged to respect
themselves at all times and under all

748
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:16,684
conditioned.

749
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:21,970
Self respect implies a determination to
maintain personal standards of behavior.

750
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,490
A man who respects himself will allow
neither himself to become slovenly nor has

751
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:30,970
quarters dirty.
Even in action.

752
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:34,540
He will take care to see that his
personal appearance suffers as little as

753
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:35,374
possible.

754
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:40,570
It is the job of the noncommissioned
officer to maintain this aspect of

755
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:41,320
discipline.

756
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:46,150
It is the function of the officer to
encourage and instill self respect.

757
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,553
So

758
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,200
interesting. He breaks that down a
little bit. Like I was talking about.

759
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,520
If I'm the senior guy and
I'm around yelling at people
about how they're looking,

760
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,383
that's not good.

761
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,990
That should be my subordinate leadership
should be tightened in that stuff up.

762
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,283
Yeah,

763
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,200
no. Okay. Here's this conclusion. Again,

764
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:14,440
this is Monte talking.
In brief,

765
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:19,180
high morale has been defined as the
quality which makes men ender and show

766
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,700
courage in times of fatigue and danger.

767
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:27,270
The cultivation of morale depends on the
training of leaders and of discipline.

768
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,030
The encouragement of comradeship
and the infusing of self respect.

769
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:41,840
The leaders must have a belief in their
cause and they must pay attention to

770
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:46,841
numerous contributory factors of
considerable but secondary importance.

771
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,420
We live today in a scientific age,

772
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:55,540
but we soldiers have to remember that
the raw material in which we have to deal

773
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:00,500
is men.
Man is still the first weapon of war.

774
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,800
His training is the most important
consideration in fashioning of a fighting

775
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:10,670
army. All modern science is
directed towards his assistance,

776
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,440
but on his efforts depends
the outcome of the battle.

777
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:21,670
The morale of the soldier is the
most important single factor in war.

778
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,880
So there is Monte,
and that's,

779
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,480
that can be said for just
about any organization,

780
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,560
what your organization is made
up with his people. And you know,

781
00:51:35,561 --> 00:51:38,980
you hear that with businesses
all the time. Our people,
our most important assets,

782
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:41,910
that's generally going to be the case.
Hmm.

783
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:43,810
Okay.

784
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:46,620
Here's some, now we get into the
leadership, the actual leadership section.

785
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,720
Interesting. Again, they start off
with morale. That's the first chapter.

786
00:51:49,721 --> 00:51:53,590
Now they move into leadership
and you know,

787
00:51:53,591 --> 00:51:55,450
clearly from what he just said,
Morales,

788
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,760
the most important thing and
winning battle. I don't agree.

789
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,040
I think leadership is the
most important thing. Now.

790
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,880
His number one is number one.
Uh,

791
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,350
factor in good morale is
leadership. So I guess, you know,

792
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:12,760
you could see where we're coming
from a different angle, but my,

793
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:14,650
my font is a little bit different.

794
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:16,540
My thought is the most
important thing is leadership.

795
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,630
And I think that leadership
covers other things.

796
00:52:19,631 --> 00:52:21,250
Just be besides the morale of the men,

797
00:52:21,251 --> 00:52:22,960
because now we're talking about
the strategies that you're using,

798
00:52:22,961 --> 00:52:26,320
the tactics that you're using.
Everything is covered by leadership,

799
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,050
including morale.
Yeah.

800
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,470
So you guys are looking
at it from not opposite,

801
00:52:32,471 --> 00:52:36,700
but just varying perspectives where he
thinks leadership is part of morality.

802
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,550
You think morale started leadership?
Yes.

803
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:43,990
I think you have identified the
situation correctly. All right.

804
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,490
Here's some more from Monte on leadership.

805
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:50,550
I would define leadership as the will
to dominate together with the character,

806
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,470
which inspires confidence.

807
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:54,940
Okay?

808
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,510
A leader has got to learn to dominate
the events would surround him.

809
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,540
He must never allow these
events to get the better of him.

810
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,810
He must allow nothing to
divert him from his aim.

811
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:10,290
He must always be on top of his job and
be prepared to accept responsibility.

812
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:13,210
So Montes,
talking about ownership.

813
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:18,211
Now what I have to caveat this with is
you get these people that are single

814
00:53:20,801 --> 00:53:21,880
minded,
right?

815
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:24,730
And that they're going to dominate
everything that's going on around them.

816
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:29,340
And they do that from a
tactical perspective, not
from a strategic perspective.

817
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:32,920
So, for instance, if you say, um,

818
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:34,650
I must never,

819
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,140
or I must dominate the events
which surround me and must
allow nothing to divert

820
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:40,974
me from my aim,

821
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:46,110
that can actually be problematic if it
doesn't make strategic sense. Right?

822
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,710
So if I'm always worried about dominating
everything that's going on around me

823
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,890
and the thing that's going on around
me isn't really that important,

824
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,600
I'm wasting my time on
it. Yeah. So this has to,

825
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:01,140
this has to be sort of offset a little
bit by the dichotomy of leadership,

826
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,410
which is, yes, you want to
dominate what's going on,

827
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,200
but if what's going on isn't important,
you need to let it go.

828
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,080
You need to just let it go a little bit.

829
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,233
Hmm.

830
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:18,220
All right, so now we're going to hear
from Jen. And by the way, this book,

831
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,480
what this book serve to lead,
it's, it's basically a bunch,

832
00:54:22,481 --> 00:54:24,070
I should have said this in the beginning,
but it's,

833
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,960
it's a bunch of small excerpts, bigger
than quotes. Some of them are just quotes,

834
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:31,790
which I don't do a bunch of like, hey,
just reading quotes. I'd do a couple,

835
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,770
I'm going to do a couple of
today, but some of them are
like, you know, two, three,

836
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:38,350
four pages of people's
views on leadership,

837
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:43,360
of which I'm pulling out some of
the highlights. And interestingly,

838
00:54:43,361 --> 00:54:45,520
for the first time I was going
through some of this and I was like,

839
00:54:45,521 --> 00:54:48,460
you know what? I'm actually,
it was something that I've,

840
00:54:48,461 --> 00:54:51,850
it's something that I've said a million
times. And so I said, you know what,

841
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:54,130
I'm not actually going
to highlight this again

842
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:01,060
because I've said it over and over
again. Now, clearly with discipline,

843
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:05,620
I just talked about it for 47 minutes
and I probably always will when I get the

844
00:55:05,621 --> 00:55:06,454
opportunity,

845
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,670
but there's a lot more about discipline
as a whole section on discipline.

846
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:12,280
We'll get to, all right,
now we're going to talk,

847
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:15,810
we're gonna hear from
General John Hackett again,

848
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,710
a World War II African campaign
as part of market garden,

849
00:55:20,711 --> 00:55:25,030
which is the big airborne operation,
the World War II than here's what he says.

850
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:28,900
I am a soldier.
In speaking of leadership,

851
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:33,990
I do so as a soldier and when I think
about it as any soldier often must I do so

852
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:36,190
in the context of battle

853
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:41,990
pressures in battle are high
and in battle. As a consequence,

854
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:47,290
the problems of leadership stand out in
bold relief and that's something very

855
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:50,090
similar to watch what I say,

856
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:55,150
which is combat is like life amplified
and intensified wrote that an extreme

857
00:55:56,211 --> 00:55:58,820
ownership and that's what I'm talking
about. And because it's that way,

858
00:55:58,821 --> 00:56:03,320
it's very easy to identify what's going
on with the leadership. It's a very,

859
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,200
the problems of leadership
stand out in bold relief.

860
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:09,230
He said it better than
me back to the book,

861
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:13,850
but while battle may be unique,
the problems that it exposes our not

862
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:15,510
yeah,

863
00:56:15,510 --> 00:56:16,330
right?
Yes.

864
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:21,330
Leadership problems and had been working
for seven years with other companies

865
00:56:22,121 --> 00:56:23,830
and people that are not to battle.

866
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,310
And guess what the problem is that battle
exposes are not unique to battle for

867
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:34,351
leadership is concerned with getting
people to do things and is most keenly

868
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:36,340
needed when difficulties,

869
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,460
doubts and dangers or at their greatest
in whatever sphere this is attempted.

870
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,910
The problems are essentially similar.
So anytime you've got a team,

871
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:47,200
you've got to try and
make him do something.

872
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,840
The problems are pretty
much going to be similar.

873
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:55,360
Back to the book I said that leadership
was concerned with getting people to do

874
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:59,950
things. What I meant was getting
them to do things a willingly.

875
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:08,010
So we don't want to just bark
orders at people that doesn't work.

876
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,200
Doesn't work in business,
doesn't work on the battlefield.

877
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,620
Will it work for five minutes?
Yes it will. Will I get,

878
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,720
I yell at you and get you
to do something. Yeah, sure.

879
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,660
You're right on monster.com looking
for a new job and then you get home.

880
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,753
Yup.

881
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:25,220
Back to the book of Man really only
gets a full response from the men.

882
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:30,200
He leads by something approaching complete
fusion of his own identity with the

883
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:34,790
hole that he and they together form.
So think about that.

884
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:37,370
If you're in charge of
something and you're a leader,

885
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,910
you need to become that thing.
You need to become that team.

886
00:57:40,911 --> 00:57:44,450
You need to become that goal.
I liked that one.

887
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,160
And you can see when people get possessed.

888
00:57:46,161 --> 00:57:49,490
Like you look at the modern business
leaders today, those are people that,

889
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,080
you know,
Steve Jobs,

890
00:57:51,081 --> 00:57:56,081
he was like obsessed with the
product that he was apple.

891
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:59,480
And that's one of those
things that was so beneficial.

892
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,840
Ilan mosque just like he is
what he's trying to do. Yeah.

893
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:09,710
Back to the book,

894
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:13,910
successful military leadership is
impossible without the leaders total

895
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:18,940
engagement in the task in hand and to
the group committed to his care for its

896
00:58:19,641 --> 00:58:23,660
discharge. And what's interesting about
that, I was talking to your brother, uh,

897
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,770
Jade Charles, I'm not too long ago
actually. It was pretty long ago. And He,

898
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,950
and he said something to me and it was
like a big revelation to him and he was

899
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:35,420
very,
is a very,

900
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,080
he had a good way of saying with what
I'm just reading about right now.

901
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:40,460
We were talking about something,

902
00:58:40,461 --> 00:58:42,580
he was going to a meeting and
he was going to be, you know,

903
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,490
talking about something.

904
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:45,980
There was some controversy about
where they were going to go and,

905
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:51,560
and he said that the person
that cares the most wins.

906
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:55,340
And that's a great statement.
It's very true.

907
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:58,610
It's not a hundred percent true,

908
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:04,140
but the percentage is very high up there
because if I just care about something

909
00:59:05,361 --> 00:59:10,361
so much and I'm going to drive with it
further than you if I care about this

910
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,260
decision more than you do.
Yeah.

911
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:18,200
I got a really good chance of winning
really good chance of winning. Yeah.

912
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:22,430
Couldn't seem to like that translates
into any. Yeah, and he'd go more.

913
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:26,480
You care about it. The more
probability. Yeah. I guess the only,

914
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:31,520
the only place where it becomes
problematic is if I, uh,

915
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,360
I care about something, you know, at 97,

916
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,100
level 97 and you care about
with the opposite decision,

917
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,490
you're also at level 97. Oh
Dang. Now we've got an issue.

918
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:47,240
Now we've got a problem because we're
both going to think we're going to win and

919
00:59:47,241 --> 00:59:50,650
we both believe that we need to win. So
now it's going to, going the distance.

920
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,600
Now we got an ego scenario going on
and things become problematic and,

921
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:56,300
and you know where this just
becomes stupid as in the,

922
00:59:56,450 --> 01:00:00,170
when you hear people having political,
I would use an air quotes on that one.

923
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:02,800
Political debates around
something. Yeah. You know,

924
01:00:02,801 --> 01:00:07,801
and this person totally believes 100%
and this person totally cares 100% and

925
01:00:08,841 --> 01:00:11,810
they're going to go nuts on each other
and they don't listen to anything that

926
01:00:11,811 --> 01:00:12,710
the other person says.

927
01:00:12,711 --> 01:00:17,180
And you ended up with a big disaster on
your hands of nonsense. A lot of those,

928
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:23,390
whether it be political diet,
that's another one. Yeah,
I know. I was listening,

929
01:00:23,450 --> 01:00:27,960
I was listening to our podcast.
Sure ain't worries.

930
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:29,760
And what we were talking about,
we were talking about,

931
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,770
I was talking about watching people in
the news and that's a classic situation

932
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:38,040
where you know, you got somebody on a
three minute segment and one person is DB,

933
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,770
you know the hardcore this direction.

934
01:00:39,771 --> 01:00:43,220
The other person is the hardcore and
the other direction. They both care.

935
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,240
They both care a lot. Neither one of
them is going to win. They actually,

936
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:49,070
that that goes the next,

937
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:54,310
that's the next realization is that if
you're going up against person that cares

938
01:00:55,641 --> 01:01:00,140
as much as you do, you actually have to
take a back step and find another way.

939
01:01:00,141 --> 01:01:01,460
You have to flank them.
Yeah.

940
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:04,000
Cause you're not going to be able to win
them by going head to head they care or

941
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,970
is it equal to you and you've got
to find a new solution. Otherwise,

942
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:11,270
you know what you'll do, expend all
your ammunition, charging machine,

943
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:14,510
gun nests and you'll die that
you don't want to do that.

944
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:17,900
If you care as much as me and
I don't have the same opinion,

945
01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:21,290
I've got to flank you. Yeah. A lot of
these probably going to let you think.

946
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:25,550
You just won the argument in order to
flank you too, by the way. Yeah. Yeah.

947
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:30,200
The um, again, political religion,
diet, how to raise kids, you know,

948
01:01:30,201 --> 01:01:33,200
all of these are all hot button.
Is that what you call it?

949
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:36,680
Things that you're not supposed to talk
to or talk about around the Thanksgiving

950
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:39,050
dinner together, they get
heated real quick. Then you,

951
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:43,280
and a lot of times we're talking
about, you know, people are not people,

952
01:01:43,281 --> 01:01:45,380
but we've talked about how much
someone cares about it, right?

953
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:51,320
A lot of times the things they get mixed
up is how much you care about it versus

954
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:55,900
how much you care about your stance on it.
Any different but and,

955
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,730
and different. And then you've got
to put your ego into both of those.

956
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:02,660
Because my ego, I don't want to admit that
I'm wrong, right? That was still to do.

957
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,570
That means you care about your stance.
So when you make it by yourself,

958
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,480
but if you care about the
issue, like if I, if I,

959
01:02:08,481 --> 01:02:12,650
if me and you were having a debate
about kettle bell workouts or something,

960
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,410
I like dumbbells Kettlebell,

961
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:19,750
but I really care about the issue and
the issue is what's the best, right?

962
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,690
If I truly care about the what,

963
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:26,340
the best exercises and not about my
stance on what the big w I'm going to care

964
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:28,800
about the real answer, read that.
Whether it's my answer or not.

965
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:32,610
So that's why I think like political, all
these other things, they have the end.

966
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:35,610
It is, it's just like how you
said it's the ego natural thing,

967
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,730
but they wind up carrying
more about their stance on it.

968
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,500
Then they do the actual issues,
you know for sure.

969
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:45,720
Don't let that happen and watch
out for that one. So yeah,

970
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,450
the [inaudible] 96 [inaudible] 97 but the,

971
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:53,040
the person who cares the most wins doesn't
apply to someone's individual stance

972
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:58,620
on something. It applies to subject.
And it also doesn't apply to, you know,

973
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,080
a Jujitsu match.
Cause I might really care about winning.

974
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:02,370
I was thinking about this the other day,

975
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,370
cause that's another thing people
say mental, oh it's all mental.

976
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,560
And here's an example.
Alex Honnold,

977
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:12,150
who's a rock climber who just
climbed El Capitan in Yosemite,

978
01:03:12,151 --> 01:03:16,320
which is 3000 feet tall.
And you people say, oh,

979
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:20,460
it's all mental. And, and
people say things, you know,

980
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:24,120
if you want something bad enough, you
can do it. You put me on that rock,

981
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,700
there's a some crux move like
2000 feet up, 2000 feet up.

982
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:31,230
That's really hard.
And you're smearing,

983
01:03:31,231 --> 01:03:34,050
which is this technique and
rock climbing where you don't,

984
01:03:34,051 --> 01:03:37,380
and I've done it before and
I'm like the lowest white belt.

985
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:38,820
I'm not even a white belt.

986
01:03:38,821 --> 01:03:41,340
And like I like someone gave me my white
belt in rock climbing or you, I'm not,

987
01:03:41,341 --> 01:03:45,000
I'm not like a legit,
but I know I've tried things.

988
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:47,970
I go to Yosemite and I'll play
around on the rocks and everything,

989
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,510
but I've tried this thing,
it's called smearing and,

990
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:54,330
and you're basically just using the
tread or just the bottom of your rock

991
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,550
climbing shoes on flat granted.

992
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:00,810
And you can create enough
friction that you can,

993
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,070
you can move up it and some
people are really good at it.

994
01:04:05,071 --> 01:04:07,940
I suck. And you know, you've got to have,

995
01:04:07,941 --> 01:04:09,390
you've got your hand
holds your work and to,

996
01:04:09,391 --> 01:04:13,590
but you're using your feet and it's this
really weird balance that you have to

997
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:17,970
do because if you push too hard and
the rocks, they, your feet slip off.

998
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:21,270
And if you don't push hard enough,
you don't get any lift.

999
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,860
So it's this really fine like
balance you've got to have.

1000
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:31,320
And apparently there's one move or this
one series of moves on this climb that

1001
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:36,180
he did that you see, you have to smear it.
Of course, this is very natural for him,

1002
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,620
but apparently he climbed that section
with a rope like six or seven times just

1003
01:04:40,621 --> 01:04:44,010
to make sure it felt good and
all that stuff. Here's my point.

1004
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,980
Even if it wasn't a smear print,

1005
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:50,460
even if he was just holding on
to rocks right at 2000 feet,

1006
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:54,780
I would absolutely want really,
really badly to hold onto the rocks.

1007
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,480
I don't have the muscular
strength to do it.

1008
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,050
I mean the things that he's holding
on to our smaller than will,

1009
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:06,600
the first pad of your fingers.
That's what he's holding onto a tiny,

1010
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:11,040
and we were doing this the other day at my
house, remember? Yup. That little thing,

1011
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:13,740
you actually had bet had
stronger grip than me on the,

1012
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:16,890
on the climbing board that I
have at my house, but I could,

1013
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,070
I could couldn't even hold on or
I could hold on for five seconds.

1014
01:05:21,071 --> 01:05:24,070
And you like had no, it did you hold
on to the really small one? Yeah. Yeah,

1015
01:05:24,071 --> 01:05:26,200
that's legit.
I can't even hold on to that thing.

1016
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:31,210
So if I was 2000 feet up and I really,
really, really, really, really,

1017
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:34,570
really wanted to do it, and I was
all mentally in the game, guess what?

1018
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,560
I'm falling into my deaf because I
don't have the strength to do it.

1019
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:43,000
I don't have the physical strength
and I need to build it and okay.

1020
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:45,430
You could say, and that might
be an acceptable answer. Okay.

1021
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:48,520
If you really have the mental
strength and will to do it,

1022
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:52,930
then you'll trade train super hard.
But at that moment, not gonna help me,

1023
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,530
I'm falling to my death. Right. Yeah.

1024
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:59,990
I think that's not a
metaphor, but like, uh, it's,

1025
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,230
it's like it's me. Yeah. That would be,
oh yeah, it's a romantic thing. Yeah.

1026
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,790
You want it bad enough you can do it.
No, actually not true. I want to do,

1027
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,470
I want to take the extreme version.
I want to stay alive.

1028
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:15,520
I'm 2000 feet up. I want really badly
to stay alive. It doesn't matter.

1029
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:19,180
I can't get across that section. I can't,
don't have the hand strength to do it.

1030
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,330
Not happening, but they're making a
movie about that. I can't wait to see it.

1031
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:24,790
About Alex Honnold climbing that rock.

1032
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:29,770
Jimmy Chin is the famous
kind of photographer guy
that they went and documented

1033
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:33,610
the whole thing and apparently one of
the articles said that during that crux

1034
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:37,120
moment, Alex Honnold was like,
Hey, when we get to here,

1035
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:41,500
just like back off with the cameras.
He apparently was like, ain't no,

1036
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,430
just back off the cameras when I go
through, you know, section 94 alpha,

1037
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:50,790
because I think he thought he didn't need
any cameras around real close when he

1038
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:56,140
might fall to his death.
It's that heavy. Yeah,

1039
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:01,060
like W W we'll or is it because it
might break his concentration or both?

1040
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,980
I Dunno. I Dunno, but that's
crazy. Have you ever been Yosemite?

1041
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,290
No,
it's,

1042
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:13,350
it's El Capitan is 3000 feet straight
up of granted it takes people three,

1043
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:16,160
four,
five days to climb up it.

1044
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:20,290
He climbed it and three hours and 45
minutes with a chalk bag and a pair of

1045
01:07:20,291 --> 01:07:25,150
shoes. It's ridiculous. It's
ridiculous. It's ridiculous.

1046
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:29,680
It's completely ridiculous.
3000 feet.

1047
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:32,680
That's very tall echo. You're trying
to imagine it. Let me help. No,

1048
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,800
I'm taller than anything you've ever seen.
It's taller than,

1049
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,320
than a skyscraper in San Diego.

1050
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:42,790
It's huge and he climbed it with no ropes.

1051
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,290
That means there's no rest.

1052
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:47,530
That means there's no break and
it means there's no mistakes.

1053
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,480
You can't make a mistake if you make
a mistake, you die. Yeah. Crazy.

1054
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,130
Very impressive.

1055
01:07:54,790 --> 01:07:57,250
I don't even know why we're talking
about Alex Honnold right now. Oh,

1056
01:07:57,251 --> 01:08:01,900
because we're talking about
the mental will. Whoever
believes that the most. Yeah.

1057
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,610
Whoever believes the most
wins cares about it. Sorry.

1058
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:07,780
I don't believe in as much as
I care about staying alive,

1059
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:09,600
I wouldn't be able to pull it off.
Yeah.

1060
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,990
I think in jade situation that it did
make sense though. You know, cause you're,

1061
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:17,930
you know, actually that does
make sense. It does make sense.

1062
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,990
And that's why I was able to do a lot
of stuff that I've been able to do in my

1063
01:08:20,991 --> 01:08:23,060
career.
When I was in the military,

1064
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:26,030
a lot of the stuff that
I was able to get done,

1065
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,660
I was able to get done because I
cared about it more than anybody else.

1066
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:33,860
You think you're going to,
you know,

1067
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:38,810
you think you're going to outperform my
task unit. I care about this so much.

1068
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:42,050
I don't care.
I care about this so much.

1069
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,900
You're not gonna be able to compete
with me because you might think, oh,

1070
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:47,030
I'll get there at five o'clock in the
morning. I've been there for an hour.

1071
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,580
You might think I'm going to
have my guys drill this 10 times.

1072
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:50,900
I'm gonna have my guys drill it 20 times.

1073
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,230
I care about this too much for you to
win. You can't beat me. You can't beat me.

1074
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,160
It's not going to happen. I care
about this too much. Not in a bad way.

1075
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:02,930
Not in a selfish way. I care about this.
I love this. This is everything to me.

1076
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:03,950
You don't know.

1077
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,860
You have other things going on and you
got your wife and you got your family and

1078
01:09:06,861 --> 01:09:09,980
you've got this other thing going on
in your life and you got goals that you

1079
01:09:09,981 --> 01:09:12,890
want. I don't care about any of those
things. This is all I care about,

1080
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,550
so therefore you can't compete with me.
And that's pretty cool.

1081
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:19,490
It's a cool place to be,
right and get overseas.

1082
01:09:19,730 --> 01:09:21,300
People aren't thinking about
all these other things now.

1083
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,510
You don't care about anything.
I don't care about anything else.

1084
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:24,590
This is the only thing I care about.

1085
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:30,480
So it ends up getting boiled
down to just not stopping. Right?

1086
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:34,610
Not quitting, not giving up. Yeah.
That definitely plays a role.

1087
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,800
That definitely plays a
role. I am, of course,

1088
01:09:36,801 --> 01:09:41,660
there's gotta be balanced because if,
let's say, I don't care about, let's say,

1089
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:44,300
you know, my, my focus is
100% my seal task unit,

1090
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:48,080
but then I forget about the fact that
we're working with our other army units.

1091
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,930
The only thing I care
about is my unit. Well, no,

1092
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:52,730
actually I need to care about
the mission more. Right?

1093
01:09:52,731 --> 01:09:55,340
I need to care about our strategic,
where we're going strategically.

1094
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:59,150
Because otherwise I'm thinking,
I just want to get my guys taken care of.

1095
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:02,570
I just want to get my guys more work.
I just want to get, no, actually I,

1096
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:05,060
I do what care.
What trumps might care for.

1097
01:10:05,061 --> 01:10:08,630
The task unit was care for the mission
of what we're trying to accomplish.

1098
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:11,000
Now luckily those two things
are completely aligned.

1099
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,550
So there was never any time
where I was thinking, oh,

1100
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:16,550
should I do this to benefit the task
and or benefit the mission? No, no.

1101
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,500
If it benefited the mission
to benefit the task unit,

1102
01:10:18,501 --> 01:10:20,600
if it benefited the task and your
benefit benefited the mission period.

1103
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,620
So I care about those things. Begin
to have a hard time competing with me.

1104
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,970
And luckily in Ramadi, there wasn't any
competition. We were all working together.

1105
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:33,971
That's what was so amazing about
it was army Marine Corp us,

1106
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,820
everyone was just working
together to accomplish missions.

1107
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:39,980
Cause that's what you get when
you get a nasty battlefield.

1108
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:44,420
You get people working together.
All right,

1109
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,470
another piece.

1110
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:53,820
This is a guy named general mom.

1111
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:54,654
Sell.

1112
01:10:55,250 --> 01:11:00,250
War is preeminently the art of the man
who dares to take the risk of the man who

1113
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:06,910
thinks deeply and clearly of the man who
when accident intervenes is not there

1114
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:09,350
by cast down,

1115
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:14,340
but changes his plants and disposition
with the readiness of a resolute and

1116
01:11:14,341 --> 01:11:19,341
reflective mind which so far as is
possible has foreseen and provided against

1117
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:24,570
difficulties. There you go. That's
what we're talking about. Oh,

1118
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:28,120
accident intervenes. Cool. Good. Yeah.

1119
01:11:29,340 --> 01:11:32,340
I'm not cast down.
Change plants adapt.

1120
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:33,910
Okay.

1121
01:11:33,910 --> 01:11:34,960
Back to the book.
No.

1122
01:11:35,020 --> 01:11:40,000
Now no man can inspire confidence in
others who is not confident in himself and

1123
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:42,190
self confidence comes from knowledge.

1124
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,600
A thorough understanding of modern
weapons and organization tactics and the

1125
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:51,220
details administration affecting all
those under his command must therefore be

1126
01:11:51,221 --> 01:11:55,620
acquired by every leader. He must show
his troops that he can plan, sound,

1127
01:11:55,621 --> 01:12:00,130
be lead resolutely and deal promptly
and effectively with the unexpected.

1128
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:04,090
In addition to gain full
confidence of his troops,

1129
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:08,560
a leader must have their
personal friendship and trust.

1130
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:10,843
Yeah,

1131
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,460
I like that. Again, I've, there was a,

1132
01:12:14,461 --> 01:12:17,010
there was a seal officer that once
was briefing guys and said, Hey, if,

1133
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,890
if your guys, if your,
if your people like you,

1134
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:25,080
they then they, uh, you're
not doing a good job. Yeah,

1135
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:27,413
not true.

1136
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,860
He's actually saying they need your
trust and personal friendship and trust.

1137
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,320
Yeah.
Once you seen something like that,

1138
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,110
that even that you can't
push that too far. Well,

1139
01:12:37,111 --> 01:12:39,990
of course bounce dichotomy of leadership.

1140
01:12:40,050 --> 01:12:44,700
You can't be such close friends that
you're choosing that you're putting one

1141
01:12:44,701 --> 01:12:48,300
person as more important
than the mission or the team.

1142
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,190
That's the dichotomy of leadership.

1143
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:51,143
Thank God.

1144
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,270
Okay.
Now he puts together this list,

1145
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:02,260
which yeah, we're, we're, we're
feeling pretty good about this one.

1146
01:13:02,261 --> 01:13:05,890
A short list to leadership
given as follows. Perfect.

1147
01:13:05,891 --> 01:13:08,110
Your military knowledge study,
the use of weapons.

1148
01:13:08,111 --> 01:13:12,880
They're tactical handing the enemy's
character and methods and way to make use

1149
01:13:12,881 --> 01:13:17,830
of ground. So I don't care what job you're
in. Apply those, right? No. Your tools.

1150
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:23,260
No the enemy. Know your competitor.
Next, study the men under your command.

1151
01:13:23,470 --> 01:13:26,500
Know them well and be known to them.

1152
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:29,740
Gain their confidence by your
knowledge, energy, and skill,

1153
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,450
and by your interest in their welfare.
Always be cheerful with them.

1154
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:38,390
However, you may feel, teach
yourself to think out. Reason.

1155
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:43,391
Depreciation's leading to
clever but uncomplicated
plans quickly and unhurriedly

1156
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,890
so there you go. Keep things simple. Know
your people. Get the I like it, says.

1157
01:13:50,891 --> 01:13:54,400
Know your people. Get them to
know you too. That's important.

1158
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:59,350
Next study methods of deception
and make full use of them.

1159
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:03,700
Always aim at misleading the enemy.
Always seek surprise.

1160
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:08,940
Keep your object clearly before you
concentrate your efforts and resources at

1161
01:14:09,221 --> 01:14:12,400
the decisive point.
Always think well ahead.

1162
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,220
Yeah,

1163
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:15,270
prioritize and execute.

1164
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:21,120
Work out the best methods of control,
different tactical situations.

1165
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:25,740
Practice them constantly.
Study the situation carefully.

1166
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,950
Don't waste any time.
Make up your mind and stick to it.

1167
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,840
Get out your orders quickly.

1168
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:35,520
Make certain that everyone clearly
knows what you intend it to be done.

1169
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,030
Commander's intent.
Maintain the initiative.

1170
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:43,920
Make opportunities and seize them at once.
I liked that.

1171
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:46,950
Make opportunities. Boy, do I like that.

1172
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:52,050
Don't wait for them to come.
Be prepared to take risks,

1173
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:55,530
but don't be foolhardy.
No,

1174
01:14:55,531 --> 01:15:00,420
your commanders intentioned and act in
accordance with it. Don't wait for orders.

1175
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:05,700
Inaction is always wrong,
so there you go. Well,

1176
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,270
this is just reiterating things
that I talk about all the time.

1177
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:13,170
Never take counsel of your fears.

1178
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:17,160
Think of the enemy's difficulties and
how you can take advantage of them.

1179
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:21,240
Remember that it is willpower
that wins. Oh, he's,

1180
01:15:21,270 --> 01:15:24,270
he's going off w not talking about caring.
He's talking about will,

1181
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:26,940
which will goes along way,

1182
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:31,770
never relaxed your efforts
until victory is won.

1183
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:36,150
Attend to the comfort of the troops
before you think of your own.

1184
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,760
This is all just phenomenal stuff.

1185
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:42,930
Be loyal to your superiors
and your subordinates.

1186
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:48,480
Express your views clearly and frankly,
but when a decision has been reached,

1187
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,600
fully support it and stop all criticism.

1188
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:58,250
Never take shelter behind others when
things for which you are responsible have

1189
01:15:58,861 --> 01:16:02,750
gone wrong.
Take some ownership.

1190
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:08,090
Oh, I like this one. Refrain
from jealousy, resentment,

1191
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:12,230
and self seeking.
Be Tactful.

1192
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:17,060
Never make friction.
Be Thoughtful and considerate,

1193
01:16:17,061 --> 01:16:19,450
but maintain from discipline.

1194
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,370
Think about how bad this thing
about the dichotomy of that.

1195
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,430
Be Thoughtful and considerate,
but maintain from discipline.

1196
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:32,820
Never ordered troops to do what you
are not prepared to do yourself.

1197
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:37,870
Never give an unnecessary order.

1198
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,320
That's a good one.
Think about that one.

1199
01:16:41,410 --> 01:16:46,410
Never give an unnecessary order and
I'll tell you why I liked that one is

1200
01:16:47,591 --> 01:16:50,530
because if you're doing
a good job as a leader,

1201
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:53,680
orders should barely even be necessary.

1202
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,710
They should barely even be necessary.

1203
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:59,980
I talked about this with life
the other day. I, I'm weak.

1204
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,990
I'm sure we could go back through,

1205
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,230
you know the history
of tasking at bruiser,

1206
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,830
but as we were having a conversation,
we were working with a company.

1207
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:13,990
I don't think I ever gave an order to
either one of my two platoon commanders,

1208
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:18,500
either life or the
Delta platoon commander.

1209
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:21,980
I don't think I ever said this
is what you're going to do.

1210
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:25,340
That's an order like you see in the
movies. Right. I'm going to ask you,

1211
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:29,870
they say that. Did they ever say
that? You say in order if you yes,

1212
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:32,630
it can be set. I'm trying to
think. I'm sure it's been, I,

1213
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,280
I think it's been said to me before,
no more like an Admin,

1214
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:39,830
like not administrative situation.
Patch.

1215
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:42,380
I don't know if anyone's ever said it
to me before, like that's an order.

1216
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:44,300
I don't know.
I'm trying to think of,

1217
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,760
there's been some situation where
someone said to me like, Hey,

1218
01:17:47,090 --> 01:17:50,530
basically like you've pushed
far enough Jocko stand down.

1219
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:54,140
Like I've gotten one of those
before. Like, Hey, we get it Jocko,

1220
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:58,550
you care about this a lot. It's not
happening to stand down. I've gotten some,

1221
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:00,290
especially got those when
I was a little younger,

1222
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,910
like when I was a young enlisted guy,
the driving with an id,

1223
01:18:04,911 --> 01:18:08,150
I just be wanting to crush it and, and
people would be kind of saying, Hey,

1224
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:12,240
well no we can't. And I'd be like, no, why
can't, why can't we? Why, why, why, why?

1225
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:15,090
Why won't we do this? We need to do this.
This is the smart thing to do. You know,

1226
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:17,990
what's the right thing to do? And I would
just eventually get like the little,

1227
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,220
hey, stand down. We're not doing it. Okay.

1228
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:23,420
You know what I'm going to do,

1229
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,190
become an officer and wanna have
to listen to you anymore. So yeah,

1230
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:31,820
I've got, I think I've gotten a couple
stand downs and my time 10 down.

1231
01:18:31,821 --> 01:18:34,470
That's an order cause he had,
that's an order that really,

1232
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,440
when you think about our,
anyway, when I think about it,

1233
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,750
it really does seem like a movie line.
Yeah.

1234
01:18:38,751 --> 01:18:42,080
And when the thing is that means that
you have not done a good job as a leader.

1235
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:44,030
If I have to say that's an order,

1236
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,040
that means I haven't done
as good a job as a leader.

1237
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:48,800
That means you don't understand the
mission. You don't understand the intent.

1238
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:49,820
You don't understand.

1239
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,510
I haven't conveyed it to you properly
and the only way I can get you to listen

1240
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:57,110
to is by saying that's an order pulling
rank. Yeah, pulling rank on you.

1241
01:18:57,111 --> 01:19:01,720
That's not a good, not a good
situation. Back to the book.

1242
01:19:01,721 --> 01:19:05,920
Never overlook failure to carry one out.

1243
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,410
So it's never given unnecessary order.

1244
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:11,440
Never overlook failure to carry one out.

1245
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,913
Okay.

1246
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:16,440
Some people will have to chime in
with their opinions on that one.

1247
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,610
Never overlook failure to carry one out.

1248
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:27,000
I'm not sure on that one.
What does that mean to carry one?

1249
01:19:27,001 --> 01:19:28,470
That's what I'm saying.
I don't know. It says,

1250
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,650
it says never ordered troops to do what?
You're not prepared to do yourself.

1251
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,990
Never given unnecessary order.

1252
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:39,200
Never overlook failure to carry one out
to carry out in order to carry one out.

1253
01:19:40,470 --> 01:19:42,270
Never overlook failure to carry one out.

1254
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:46,750
I'm not sure what he means by that book.

1255
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:49,760
I'm sure some people will give us
some opinions on that one. Yeah,

1256
01:19:49,970 --> 01:19:54,970
on the Facebook you and I release keep
fit yourself and make certain that your

1257
01:19:55,731 --> 01:20:00,731
men do to keep your own nerves
under control and study your men's

1258
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,903
good

1259
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:09,180
for like when you want to comment. If
you're listening and you want to comment,

1260
01:20:09,181 --> 01:20:10,500
you have an opinion on that one.

1261
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:15,600
Put It on the Facebook posts so it can
follow the conversation as opposed to

1262
01:20:15,601 --> 01:20:17,940
Twitter, which is 140
characters. You know what I mean?

1263
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:22,460
It's easier to see it on Facebook when
there's a legit question or someone has

1264
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,940
some legit big feedback.

1265
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:29,190
If you put it on the thread for
podcasts number 81, when I post it,

1266
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:34,440
that's the place to put in there in the
replies when I can like converse back on

1267
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:39,441
that subject without having to go through
17,000 tweets and then go back and

1268
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:44,100
forth.
So it's all laid out on Facebook.

1269
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:47,970
So it's a good place to have those
little conversations. Twitter,

1270
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,290
we have different kinds of
conversations. Sure. Last of all,

1271
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:57,420
remember that success in war depends more
than anything else on the will to win.

1272
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:01,950
Cool. Again, now we've
got Monte saying Morales,

1273
01:21:01,951 --> 01:21:06,951
the most important we got Jocko saying
leadership is the most important and you

1274
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:10,830
got brigadier general month sell saying

1275
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:14,310
that the will to win
is the most important.

1276
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:17,400
I'm not going to actually argue
with either one of these guys.

1277
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:21,840
These guys were all uh,
all kinds of experience.

1278
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:24,090
Much more intense than mine.

1279
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:30,570
Speaking of intense
experience more than mine.

1280
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,790
There's a guy,
a pseudonym,

1281
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:37,230
meaning a fake name Basil Lisc.

1282
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:42,030
And the guy wrote something called talks
on leadership and the guy's actual name

1283
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:47,031
was Alfred burn and he was a world war
one and World War Two veteran and he was

1284
01:21:50,311 --> 01:21:55,140
a military historian and he's got a
little section in here called the being

1285
01:21:55,141 --> 01:21:55,974
straight.

1286
01:21:56,760 --> 01:22:00,720
There's one trait in the character of
a leader that above all things really

1287
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:05,721
counts and it perhaps counts in war
even more than in peace being straight.

1288
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:09,690
No amount of ability,

1289
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:14,550
knowledge or cunning can ever
make up for not being straight.

1290
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:19,680
Once those under him find
out that a commander is
absolutely straight and all of

1291
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:23,880
his dealings with them and free from the
slightest trade of self interest other

1292
01:22:23,881 --> 01:22:26,640
than the self interest of
which we are all guilty.

1293
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:29,730
When striving for victory of
causes we believe to be right,

1294
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:33,510
they will love him as their
leader, trust him, worked for him,

1295
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:37,710
follow him and should the occasion arise,

1296
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,920
die for him with the fundamental ability
of the British soldier which comes to

1297
01:22:43,051 --> 01:22:46,020
the surface when things
are at their worst.

1298
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:52,350
So being straight with your people,
very important,

1299
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,380
very important.
In fact,

1300
01:22:56,070 --> 01:23:00,600
perhaps his most important.
Above all.

1301
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:04,050
So now we've got another factor.
That's the most important thing.

1302
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:10,450
Now you're going to hear a
little on leadership from
Field Marshal Lord herring.

1303
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:15,250
Once again,
World War One and World War II veteran,

1304
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:20,920
he also fought in the
second battle of Al Ameen.

1305
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:26,470
He was a wounded,
lost some fingers recovered,

1306
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:30,700
got back to the fight.
So he says about leadership here,

1307
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:34,450
there are some people who believe that
leadership is something which is inborn

1308
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:37,180
or which you acquire
automatically at a public school.

1309
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,070
But neither of those things are true.

1310
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:42,430
There are certain fundamental qualities
which affect leadership in which depend

1311
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:47,320
to a very large extent on upbringing
and the moral and spiritual values which

1312
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:51,250
you can learn what you learn in your
family and in your environment as a young

1313
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,830
man.
But there was no special way,

1314
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:59,040
nor is there any special caste or class
which has the prerogative of leadership.

1315
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,780
There are many forms of leadership.
Political parties have their leaders,

1316
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:09,470
every big organization and industry
or commerce all have their leaders.

1317
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,540
And at the other end of the scale,

1318
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:16,130
so do dance bands and so do
gangs of thieves. And smugglers.

1319
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:21,470
There are many qualities that apply
equally to every type of leader,

1320
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:26,340
but you and I are concerned
with one particular type
of leadership to my mind at

1321
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:31,380
the highest type of all and
that is leadership on the
battlefield and I believe

1322
01:24:31,671 --> 01:24:35,720
it to be the highest type because it
has to be exercised under conditions of

1323
01:24:35,721 --> 01:24:38,030
great difficulty and considerable danger.

1324
01:24:39,410 --> 01:24:40,730
I would like to be quiet.

1325
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:44,900
I would like you to be quite clear about
the conditions under which you will

1326
01:24:44,901 --> 01:24:49,070
have to exercise leadership.
You will frequently be tired.

1327
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:53,570
You may also be cold and
wet and hungry and thirsty.

1328
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:57,680
You may be dripping with sweat
or you may be freezing with cold.

1329
01:24:57,950 --> 01:25:00,860
You won't know precisely what is going on.

1330
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:04,370
You won't know exactly where the enemy is.

1331
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:09,200
You certainly won't know what he is going
to do or what his capabilities are of

1332
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:10,034
doing anything.

1333
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:16,130
You may not know where your own people
are or what they are going to do.

1334
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:18,480
To put it briefly,

1335
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:23,130
you've got to be able to
exercise leadership and
conditions of fatigue and fear,

1336
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:27,120
uncertainty and ignorance
and often in isolation.

1337
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:32,770
That is what makes it extremely difficult
and that is why leadership on the

1338
01:25:32,771 --> 01:25:37,300
battlefield calls in my view
for the highest qualities,

1339
01:25:39,950 --> 01:25:41,870
many qualities are required in leader.

1340
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:45,170
Different people have different
views about which are more important.

1341
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:50,360
In my opinion, there are five
outstanding mental and physical,

1342
01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:55,010
moral and spiritual qualities without
which you cannot hope to be successful and

1343
01:25:55,011 --> 01:25:56,330
a good leader on the battlefield.

1344
01:25:57,620 --> 01:26:02,620
The first of those qualities is a mental
and physical one and that is fitness,

1345
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:08,210
absolute fitness of mind and body.

1346
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,903
So

1347
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:14,430
make sure you're getting your
morning physical training in

1348
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:21,370
physical fitness, mental fitness. Next.

1349
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:25,780
Then I would say you've got
to have complete integrity.
You've got to be honest,

1350
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:29,680
not only with yourselves but with the
menu lead and the people with whom you

1351
01:26:29,681 --> 01:26:34,681
work and honesty and an integrity are
things that you cannot compromise with.

1352
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,080
You cannot alter.
If you do,

1353
01:26:38,081 --> 01:26:41,320
you will lose confidence and
you will not be able to lead.

1354
01:26:41,470 --> 01:26:43,870
You must have complete integrity.

1355
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:46,213
So

1356
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,420
that's the same thing as being straight.
Yeah.

1357
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:53,550
Not after that.

1358
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:59,400
Not In any next to, sorry. Next after
that. Not In any order of priority,

1359
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:02,550
but this is how I have put
them down deep in my mind.

1360
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:06,150
There is an enduring courage pretty well.

1361
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:08,580
Everyone can be brave for a few minutes.

1362
01:27:08,730 --> 01:27:11,460
Most of us can if we
steal ourselves to it.

1363
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:15,660
Take one pledge or make one
decision or incur one risk,

1364
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,620
but the sort of courage you must have to
lead on the battlefield is an enduring

1365
01:27:19,621 --> 01:27:24,621
courage and one that you will go that
will go on when other people falter.

1366
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,940
One that will enable you to do what you
know to be right irrespective of the

1367
01:27:29,941 --> 01:27:32,370
danger or the difficulty.
Contrary,

1368
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:35,880
often contrary to the advice
of well meaning friends,

1369
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:39,723
so

1370
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:45,230
gotta have courage.
Next then you must have daring initiative.

1371
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:50,060
Initiative means doing right away
what you might. If you had time,

1372
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:54,050
think of doing a few minutes later.

1373
01:27:55,450 --> 01:27:55,820
I like

1374
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:00,170
this.
If you wait for things to happen to you,

1375
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:01,910
they will happen.
All right

1376
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,460
and here I am quoting the words of
my predecessor also spoken here.

1377
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:13,440
They will happen to you but they won't
be what you like and they certainly won't

1378
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:14,850
bring you success.

1379
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:19,710
Initiative means seeing at once and
very quickly what needs to be done,

1380
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:23,070
making up your mind to do it and
then seeing it through to the middle,

1381
01:28:23,071 --> 01:28:23,904
a bitter end,

1382
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:27,520
so I love that one.

1383
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:31,780
If you wait for things to happen to you,
they certainly will

1384
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:39,580
a little bit more on willpower here,
then you must have undaunted willpower.

1385
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:43,720
The willpower is the motive power.

1386
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:49,200
It is what enables you to make yourself
fit in mind and body to produce in you,

1387
01:28:49,631 --> 01:28:51,160
in your heart.
The courage,

1388
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:55,990
the enduring courage that I spoke of to
give you the courage to do your duty and

1389
01:28:55,991 --> 01:28:58,570
to make the sacrifice that
may be called from you.

1390
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:03,840
It is the willpower that you to take
the initiative, to make the plan,

1391
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,960
to do what is required to see through
and that will power must be undaunted.

1392
01:29:10,380 --> 01:29:14,010
It must never allow itself
to be overcome or subdued.

1393
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:19,850
Perhaps the finest example living today
of the power and influence for good of

1394
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:23,160
man. We've undaunted willpower
as our prime minister.

1395
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,560
In one of the critical periods of
the last war, he spoke certain words.

1396
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:30,960
I am going to quote you now.
He said,

1397
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:35,310
all the great struggles in history
have been won by superior willpower,

1398
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,520
resting victory in the teeth of odds
or upon the narrowest of margins.

1399
01:29:43,180 --> 01:29:48,180
It is the willpower that is superior
that can rest victory and the teeth of

1400
01:29:48,371 --> 01:29:49,204
odds.

1401
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:54,490
That is the type of willpower that has
got to be developed in a leader on the

1402
01:29:54,491 --> 01:29:55,324
battlefield.

1403
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:02,380
Mobilize your will.

1404
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:04,730
Yeah.

1405
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:08,120
Now he talks about some other qualities.
He talks about knowledge.

1406
01:30:08,121 --> 01:30:12,530
He talks about judgment.
He talks about Team Spirit's saying,

1407
01:30:12,531 --> 01:30:16,520
because you cannot get success
on the battlefield by yourself.

1408
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:19,220
You've got to work with other people,

1409
01:30:19,221 --> 01:30:24,221
so obviously as a leader you have
to have that spirit of teamwork

1410
01:30:27,500 --> 01:30:31,400
and closing out. He says, there's one
other thing I would like to say to you

1411
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:40,330
as British officers, you will never
have all you want. All you need,

1412
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:45,250
you'll be short of this or that or the
other. Sometimes you will be short of men.

1413
01:30:45,400 --> 01:30:48,760
Other Times your equipments are weapons
may not be as good as you think they

1414
01:30:48,761 --> 01:30:52,420
ought to be, nor will you have
as many as you would like.

1415
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,520
You may be short of ammunition.

1416
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:59,700
You may also be sure to food and water
or other necessary things when these

1417
01:31:00,071 --> 01:31:03,790
circumstances arise as they do
often throughout your service,

1418
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:05,500
both in peace and war,

1419
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:10,540
there's only one motto and that is to
make certain that you do the very best you

1420
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:12,460
can with what you got.

1421
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:16,330
Don't belly gate about
what you have not got,

1422
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:21,580
but get on and make certain you do
your utmost with what you have got.

1423
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:26,220
Now, to sum up what I've
tried to say this afternoon,

1424
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:30,990
I would like to put it like this
first, keep fit, absolutely fit.

1425
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:35,790
Then be honest, honest with yourselves,
and honest with those with whom you work.

1426
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:40,350
Then have courage and make
it an enduring courage. Next,

1427
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:43,440
be bold. Be Daring, and
when there is a choice,

1428
01:31:43,441 --> 01:31:45,510
take the bold and daring course.

1429
01:31:46,970 --> 01:31:51,380
Make the very most of what
you have got and never, never,

1430
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:54,050
never give in.

1431
01:31:58,960 --> 01:31:59,793
Yes.

1432
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:06,810
Do what you can with what you've got
until you really liked the whole night.

1433
01:32:06,811 --> 01:32:09,530
Yeah, yeah. Sometimes it's
time to start dating me.

1434
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:13,820
All right,

1435
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:18,070
next,
there's a chapter in this book,

1436
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:21,700
which is called discipline,
which makes me very happy.

1437
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:23,890
And again,

1438
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:28,920
I tried to censor myself from not
just doing the entire chapter.

1439
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:33,340
Obviously you can buy this book if
you want to see the whole thing.

1440
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:35,530
There's some great points.

1441
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:40,680
This first one is from field marshal
Earl wave bell who was in the Bueler wars

1442
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:49,740
and he was in World War One and in
World War II he lost his left eye in the

1443
01:32:51,071 --> 01:32:51,970
battle of [inaudible].

1444
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:56,200
So we're talking a warrior here
that was went back for service.

1445
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:00,460
Here's what he said about discipline.
Discipline is teaching,

1446
01:33:01,330 --> 01:33:06,070
which makes a man do something which he
would not unless he had learnt that it

1447
01:33:06,071 --> 01:33:10,600
was the right, the proper,
and the expedient thing to do.

1448
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:12,430
At its best,

1449
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:18,120
it is instilled and maintained
by pride in one's self,

1450
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:21,610
in one's unit,
in one's profession,

1451
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:26,770
only at its worst by fear of punishment.
So he's talking,

1452
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:31,570
we want self discipline. We
don't want impose discipline.
That's what he's saying.

1453
01:33:32,140 --> 01:33:35,170
You don't want, I don't want you doing
this because you're scared of me.

1454
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:38,020
If you don't do what I tell you, I'm
going to beat you. That's not what I want.

1455
01:33:38,440 --> 01:33:41,230
I want you saying I'm going to
do this because I want to do it.

1456
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:45,760
Here's a little something from Monte
here and we're going to get some

1457
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:48,190
disagreements going. I'm going
to disagree with Monte. Sorry.

1458
01:33:48,191 --> 01:33:50,140
Monti wish you were
here to defend yourself.

1459
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,880
Okay. On Discipline Monte, the basis of
training must be self-discipline. Cool.

1460
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:03,720
A man must learn to be the master of
himself and to keep in subjection the bad

1461
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:06,490
qualities in his makeup.

1462
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:11,520
I love that self discipline can be
developed by training and such things as

1463
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:16,030
conception of duty, self
control, self respect,

1464
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:17,800
endurance and so on.

1465
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:22,420
We then have collective discipline
and there's no doubt that the initial

1466
01:34:22,421 --> 01:34:25,090
training in this subject is
best carried out by drill.

1467
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:30,880
Men must be taught
instinctively to obey orders,

1468
01:34:30,970 --> 01:34:32,200
whatever they are.

1469
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:40,160
I do not believe men we'll fight to
voluntarily for a cause without the iron

1470
01:34:40,501 --> 01:34:41,580
bonds of discipline.

1471
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:48,410
The best form of discipline
is subordination of self
for the benefit of the

1472
01:34:48,421 --> 01:34:52,110
community. So I'm going to
make some comments on those.

1473
01:34:53,010 --> 01:34:53,850
Number one,

1474
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,000
when you saying that you should obey
orders regardless of what they are,

1475
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:04,430
don't agree. I don't agree with that.
I want my men to question my orders.

1476
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:06,080
I want them to,

1477
01:35:06,081 --> 01:35:08,420
if I'm telling you them to do something
that they don't think it's smart,

1478
01:35:08,421 --> 01:35:12,230
I want them to question me. I want them
to come up with them a better solution.

1479
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:16,830
That's how we're going to win
the moral thing to write.

1480
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:22,520
Like to obey orders regardless.
Oh yeah. Oh, for sure.

1481
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,020
For sure. I want my whole team to be,
hey, if this is the wrong thing to do,

1482
01:35:27,021 --> 01:35:31,850
we shouldn't be doing it. Yeah. Next,

1483
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:37,060
the other one he says here is he says
that people won't fight for a cause

1484
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:40,070
without the iron bonds of discipline.
I don't believe that that's true either.

1485
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:45,110
Hmm. And I think if you look
at American history guys,

1486
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:48,710
the, we didn't have the strict level.
Of course there's, there's discipline.

1487
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:52,010
Of course in the military I, there's
imposed discipline in the military.

1488
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:57,310
But the things that people
and all soldiers I have
accomplished without strict

1489
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:04,211
imposed discipline is they've given their
lives over and over and over thousands

1490
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:07,220
and thousands and thousands and hundreds
of thousands of cases where men have

1491
01:36:07,221 --> 01:36:09,020
given their lives.
Not because,

1492
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:14,830
not because I said or because the leader
said go into charge this machine gun

1493
01:36:15,771 --> 01:36:17,690
nest. That's, that's not why they did it.

1494
01:36:18,140 --> 01:36:19,700
They did it because they
believed in the cause.

1495
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:24,110
So I don't agree with that one.

1496
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,960
I think that men will fight
voluntarily for our cause.

1497
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:28,440
Okay.

1498
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,680
Without the iron balance of discipline.
And you know, when I think they do it,

1499
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:34,710
I think they do it when
that causes freedom.

1500
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:39,240
So when the cause is freedom,
I believe men,

1501
01:36:39,241 --> 01:36:43,950
we'll fight without the bonds of
discipline over them. Hmm. And

1502
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:51,420
this idea that the best form of discipline
is the subordination of self for the

1503
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:54,220
benefit of the community. I don't
actually agree with that one either.

1504
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:59,550
I think the best form of discipline
is when there is alignment in the

1505
01:36:59,921 --> 01:37:00,754
discipline,

1506
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:07,170
the discipline for the team and the
individual bring success and survival and

1507
01:37:09,731 --> 01:37:12,550
freedom and when those things are aligned,

1508
01:37:12,670 --> 01:37:16,780
that's when I think you get
the finest form of discipline.

1509
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,700
Now he recovers a little bit from
my criticism here. Sure, sure.

1510
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:28,350
And of course to everyone that is
wondering why I'm sort of making fun of

1511
01:37:29,381 --> 01:37:29,950
myself.

1512
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:34,950
It's pretty embarrassing to be sitting
here and disagreeing with a guy like

1513
01:37:35,081 --> 01:37:37,840
Monte,
so please don't take me the wrong way.

1514
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:43,460
I'm just giving my opinion here that
I'm in no way comparing my military

1515
01:37:45,881 --> 01:37:50,881
knowledge with General
Montgomery and he does say this,

1516
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:53,580
the basis of all discipline
is self discipline,

1517
01:37:55,440 --> 01:37:58,680
which this is beautiful.
When I agree with that 100% this,

1518
01:37:58,681 --> 01:38:03,540
this self discipline may come from within
a person or may be imposed upon him

1519
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:08,280
from without. Don't agree. That'll only
last a little while. Whatever it serves,

1520
01:38:08,370 --> 01:38:12,840
its source eight involves the idea
of self control and self restraint.

1521
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,490
That is true.

1522
01:38:18,070 --> 01:38:20,200
There is,
I think it's called.

1523
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:22,020
Yeah,

1524
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:26,580
situational discipline I think.
Or what does that could,

1525
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,510
I could have the expression wrong, but
I think it is situational. Just meaning,

1526
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:32,383
yeah,

1527
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:36,580
like if you're in a certain
situation you'll have,

1528
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:42,130
you'll be really self
disciplined, but once you get
out, you're not, you know, like,

1529
01:38:42,131 --> 01:38:45,450
um, I don't know. You ever, you
ever watched what's the big,

1530
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,870
there's a show called the biggest loser.
No.

1531
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:53,440
So that's the only people that are having
weight problems. They go on a show,

1532
01:38:53,441 --> 01:38:56,830
they get fed certain things and made to
work out and they lose a bunch of weight

1533
01:38:57,130 --> 01:38:59,830
and then they win the program and then
when they go back home and they're not

1534
01:38:59,831 --> 01:39:03,370
around that impose discipline. Right.
They lose it. Right. That's my point.

1535
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:07,900
My point is that that imposed discipline,
it works.

1536
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:12,820
While you have the input in they,
they're watching you.

1537
01:39:13,060 --> 01:39:18,060
What I would prefer is to have someone
that makes out change in their mindset

1538
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:20,950
and develops self discipline right now.

1539
01:39:20,951 --> 01:39:25,951
Sometimes you can get that from imposed
discipline and you realize like you get

1540
01:39:26,561 --> 01:39:29,530
shown the freedom that it discipline
gives you and then you carry on with it.

1541
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,910
Like a lot of people that listen to
the podcast and they've done incredible

1542
01:39:33,911 --> 01:39:37,690
things with their lives because we weren't
there to impose discipline on them,

1543
01:39:37,691 --> 01:39:40,360
but they recognize themselves. Maybe
they said, okay, you know what,

1544
01:39:40,361 --> 01:39:42,340
I'm going to get up for the next
two weeks and gonna get up early.

1545
01:39:42,341 --> 01:39:45,070
I'm going to workout, I'm going
to eat healthy. Two weeks go by,

1546
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:47,500
they've lost a little bit of body fat,

1547
01:39:47,501 --> 01:39:51,060
they've gained a little bit of
muscle and they feel good. Right?

1548
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:55,140
And all of a sudden they realize the
benefits of discipline and so they changed

1549
01:39:55,141 --> 01:39:57,550
their mindset and they become more
disciplined human beings. Yeah.

1550
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:02,680
That's what I like when I don't like is
it all run a bootcamp on you and yell at

1551
01:40:02,681 --> 01:40:05,350
you and screaming, but that's another
thing people want me to yell and scream.

1552
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,610
I get that. I think once or
twice a day someone will say,

1553
01:40:09,611 --> 01:40:13,090
you need to make an alarm clock where
you'd yell and tell us to tell me to get

1554
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:16,150
out of bed.
I said good psychological warfare,

1555
01:40:16,151 --> 01:40:18,670
but I'm not going to yell
and psychological warfare
because yelling isn't an

1556
01:40:18,671 --> 01:40:23,671
effective tool compared to actually
speaking to someone and letting them

1557
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:28,720
understand why it's important. Yeah.
That's the preferred tool. Occasionally.

1558
01:40:28,721 --> 01:40:30,760
Do you got to yell at people
occasionally? Yes. You do. Okay.

1559
01:40:30,761 --> 01:40:35,750
Usually not very often though.
Yeah. That's pretty rare,
Huh? But yeah, the yeah,

1560
01:40:35,751 --> 01:40:37,810
you're right.
Hub with that situational discipline.

1561
01:40:37,811 --> 01:40:40,300
Cause even I think about what's worse.

1562
01:40:40,750 --> 01:40:45,610
Somebody yelling at you or someone
whispering, it's you. It's actually worse,

1563
01:40:45,611 --> 01:40:50,140
isn't it? Some ways. In a lot of
ways, yeah. To me it's worse. Sure.

1564
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:54,010
Yelling and screaming does,
doesn't know. And it really doesn't

1565
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:56,980
really matter what they're saying either
if he choose yelling or whispering.

1566
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,490
Cause like, you know, even if they're
telling you a normal thing like, hey,

1567
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:03,520
I'm here. This is what I want from
the store. I want Avocados, tomatoes,

1568
01:41:03,790 --> 01:41:07,760
and you know, some wine. But what
if I whisper it to you? Hey chuck,

1569
01:41:08,430 --> 01:41:12,500
come here bro. That my freak
me out. Actually he may give
me something. Yeah. Yeah.

1570
01:41:12,501 --> 01:41:16,540
So it did exist. No, no, you
get that. That's the point.

1571
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:19,080
It doesn't really matter what
they're saying with Spring versus,

1572
01:41:19,081 --> 01:41:22,390
he definitely has a different
psychological effects for sure.

1573
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:26,910
Cause that's definitely freaks me out.
Hey Jack,

1574
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:30,670
we didn't pick up a bottle of wine.
No, actually I can. I'm leaving.

1575
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:36,150
Yeah, the wine kind of makes
it extra awkward for sure.

1576
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,330
All right, so now we get into another
part on discipline right here.

1577
01:41:40,331 --> 01:41:45,331
And this is Sir John Four to skew and
what you pay attention to this one because

1578
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:48,010
when we start going sideways,

1579
01:41:48,910 --> 01:41:53,260
I have in my mind rather those excellent
but generally unthinking persons who

1580
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:58,290
shrink with horror from the idea of
a man's abdicating his civil rights.

1581
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:05,100
What they say a man must obey
even an unjust command under pain.

1582
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:06,730
It may be of death.

1583
01:42:07,090 --> 01:42:11,500
It is monstrous for
purposes of civil life,

1584
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:12,670
it might be monstrous,

1585
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:17,470
but not for the purposes
of implicit obedience,

1586
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:20,830
which is the thing that
matters in the army.

1587
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:26,470
Let there be justice as far
as possible by home means.

1588
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:28,420
But as a general principle,

1589
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:33,630
it is better for an army that an injustice
should be done than that in order

1590
01:42:33,911 --> 01:42:37,180
should be disobeyed.
This however,

1591
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:39,160
is an argument that cannot appeal to our,

1592
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:44,440
to our imaginary objector because
he has red, no military history.

1593
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,450
So that's just very disturbing.
This whole thing.

1594
01:42:49,451 --> 01:42:52,780
And it's really doesn't comply
with anything that I say,

1595
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:56,500
which is I want you to question orders
and if they're not good orders that you

1596
01:42:56,501 --> 01:42:58,150
shouldn't obey him. And
he said, no, no, no,

1597
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:01,690
it's better to do something unjust
as long as you are obeying orders.

1598
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:07,110
And I get a little bit of research
about John Four to skew and you know,

1599
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:12,190
obviously I don't agree with this. And
actually in the new version of the book,

1600
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,260
He,
the,

1601
01:43:13,260 --> 01:43:18,250
the guy that writes the forward to the
new version of this specifically calls

1602
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:21,160
out John Four to skew and says,

1603
01:43:21,161 --> 01:43:24,760
we removed him the him,
these were gone from the book.

1604
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:30,400
And what I found out about him was yes,
he was in the army,

1605
01:43:30,610 --> 01:43:34,810
he was a major in the army. Um, but
I don't think he was in any combat.

1606
01:43:34,810 --> 01:43:39,810
And what I do know is that he was the
royal librarian from 1905 until 1926 and

1607
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:47,020
he died in 1923 so he
didn't go to World War One.

1608
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:50,410
All these other guys are World War One,
World War II veterans.

1609
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:53,360
He was the like the Royal Librarian.

1610
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:57,890
And it's interesting when he says
because he has red, no military.

1611
01:43:57,891 --> 01:44:00,700
He hasn't said cause he's never been
in combat before. He says he's ready.

1612
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:03,710
The person that would object to this
has never read military history.

1613
01:44:04,430 --> 01:44:08,990
Well Yeah Uri. Yeah, he's going
with the theory. Yeah. And,

1614
01:44:08,991 --> 01:44:11,780
and if you want to take this
and stretch it out more broadly,

1615
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:16,790
this attitude, you know,
I hate World War One.

1616
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:22,630
I hate world war one because it was so
based on obedience and you are going to

1617
01:44:25,881 --> 01:44:27,650
charge,
we're going to charge this trench.

1618
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:32,570
All 7,000 of us are going
to charge tomorrow morning
at zero six 30 where to go

1619
01:44:32,571 --> 01:44:33,140
over the top.

1620
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:35,890
We're going to get mowed down by machine
guns and then the people are going to

1621
01:44:35,891 --> 01:44:40,160
follow us. And do the same thing. And
they, they've guys were so obedient

1622
01:44:41,810 --> 01:44:45,230
and brave and just selfless to do that.

1623
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:51,490
But this attitude is what made that
war so devastating because no one said,

1624
01:44:53,061 --> 01:44:56,900
hey, wait a second. This
doesn't seem smart to me. Yeah,

1625
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:02,060
I just watched, you know, two, three,
four battalions are two, three,

1626
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:07,061
four regiments get mowed down and now
you're telling me I'm going to do the same

1627
01:45:07,281 --> 01:45:11,300
thing tomorrow with my men?
No,

1628
01:45:11,301 --> 01:45:14,930
I want you to question my orders.
I want you to say no.

1629
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:19,520
If I'm making you do something that
doesn't make sense, I want you to say no.

1630
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:23,360
And if I can't explain it
to you in a logical way,

1631
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:26,730
then I should rethink what
I'm saying to you. Hmm.

1632
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:33,440
So Mr. John Ford Askew,

1633
01:45:34,410 --> 01:45:38,790
we're going to have to say that we've got
to change our opinion on, on obedience.

1634
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,330
And there are more important
things than obedience in a team,

1635
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:44,820
in a military team and
in the business world.

1636
01:45:49,390 --> 01:45:53,440
Here's another piece from this is
going back to General Williams slim.

1637
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:58,060
Any army without discipline as no more
than a mob alternating between frightened

1638
01:45:58,061 --> 01:46:02,650
sheep and beasts of prey discipline as
the British soldiers demonstrated in

1639
01:46:02,651 --> 01:46:07,651
peace and war is the old
Christian virtue of unselfishness,

1640
01:46:07,721 --> 01:46:10,060
of standing by your neighbor,
your comrade.

1641
01:46:10,710 --> 01:46:14,410
It is the sacrifice of a man's
comfort, inclination, safety,

1642
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:18,340
even life for others,
for something greater than himself.

1643
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:24,440
It is the refusal to be the weak link
in the chain that snaps under under

1644
01:46:25,481 --> 01:46:29,440
strain, and this is a great
little story here. One paragraph

1645
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:31,631
back to the book.

1646
01:46:31,631 --> 01:46:36,190
Once from the safety of
a well dug command post,

1647
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:41,310
I looked down on a battery of our
artillery inaction in the African Bush.

1648
01:46:42,190 --> 01:46:45,310
It was firing at five
rounds per gun per minute,

1649
01:46:46,390 --> 01:46:51,390
and ideally I the
nearest gun in that area.

1650
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:58,100
The enemy unfortunately had complete
local air supremacy and guns,

1651
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:00,570
unless engaged in some vital tasks,

1652
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:05,130
were ordered to remain silent
whenever hostile aircraft appeared

1653
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:11,660
gradually dominating all other sounds
came the dull drone of bombers flying low.

1654
01:47:12,900 --> 01:47:17,900
But the guns went on firing five
rounds per gun per minute for they were

1655
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:22,830
supporting an infantry attack
covered move. By the way,

1656
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:26,880
the first stick of bombs
fell around the gun.

1657
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:30,270
I was watching some of his crew were hit.

1658
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:35,520
The dry brush roared into flame,

1659
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:39,750
which spread instantly to the
camouflage nets over the gun.

1660
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:44,310
It vanished from my site
and smoke and flame.

1661
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:50,990
Yet from the very midst of that inferno
at the exact intervals came the flash

1662
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:55,200
and thud of the firing gun.

1663
01:47:56,910 --> 01:47:59,910
Five rounds per minute per gun,

1664
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,990
never falter,
never a second out,

1665
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:10,350
no weak link there.
The discipline held.

1666
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:16,660
That's pretty awesome

1667
01:48:21,190 --> 01:48:26,190
sections here talking about
duty and service and we're
going to first start with

1668
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:30,160
Colonel George Henderson,
a British officer

1669
01:48:32,140 --> 01:48:37,140
who fought in Egypt and
at the battle of Kasasa

1670
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:44,290
and he fought in the
bueler awards as well,

1671
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:48,130
and he talks about Waterloo.
Here we go. Back to the book.

1672
01:48:48,131 --> 01:48:50,980
No incident is more familiar
in our military history.

1673
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:56,190
Then the stubborn resistance of
the British line at Waterloo truth.

1674
01:48:56,990 --> 01:48:58,930
The long hours of the mid Summer Day,

1675
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:04,020
silent and immovable squares and
squadrons stood in the trampled corn,

1676
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:09,840
harassed by an almost incessant fire
of candidate and musketry to which they

1677
01:49:10,091 --> 01:49:14,170
were forbidden to make reply.
Not a moment,

1678
01:49:14,980 --> 01:49:18,970
but heard some cry of agony.
Not a moment,

1679
01:49:19,300 --> 01:49:23,050
but some comrade fell head
long into the furrows.

1680
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:29,280
Yet as bullets of the skirmishers hailed
around them and the great shot tore

1681
01:49:31,031 --> 01:49:35,890
through the tight packed ranks,
the word was passed quietly

1682
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:42,040
close in on the center men and
as the sun near its setting,

1683
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:47,610
the regiments still shoulder to shoulder
stood fast upon the ground they had

1684
01:49:47,801 --> 01:49:48,820
held at noon.

1685
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:56,200
The spectacle is characteristic
in good fortune and in ill.

1686
01:49:56,690 --> 01:50:01,690
It is rare indeed that a British
regimen does not hold together and this

1687
01:50:03,110 --> 01:50:04,910
indestructible cohesion,

1688
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:10,120
best of all qualities that an armed
body can possess is based not merely on

1689
01:50:10,461 --> 01:50:12,020
hereditary resolution,

1690
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:16,250
but on mutual confidence
and mutual respect.

1691
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:21,560
The man and the ranks has
implicit faith in his officer,

1692
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:23,150
the officer,

1693
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:28,390
and almost unbounded belief in the
valor and discipline of his men.

1694
01:50:33,950 --> 01:50:38,950
And that I've talked about this and
people want to know what makes the seal

1695
01:50:39,261 --> 01:50:41,660
teams do well.

1696
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:45,980
The thing that makes the seal teams do
well is the bond that holds them together.

1697
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:51,260
And that bond is so strong
that it's unbreakable.

1698
01:50:52,460 --> 01:50:56,810
And that's why seals do well in
combat because we have a bond that is

1699
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:59,810
unbreakable, stronger than anything
that's going to get thrown at us.

1700
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:05,280
The Brotherhood is going to stand.
Hey,

1701
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:09,480
I'm gonna close this book
out with two more quotes.

1702
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:14,160
And speaking of Waterloo,
this one is from Wellington

1703
01:51:16,460 --> 01:51:19,280
and this is a very simple quote.
He said,

1704
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:24,580
my rule was always to do the
business of the day in the day.

1705
01:51:27,860 --> 01:51:29,030
And I,

1706
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:32,930
I was reading this book the other day
and I actually posted something about it,

1707
01:51:33,230 --> 01:51:36,380
but I, I, I was, I didn't realize
I was thinking about this,

1708
01:51:36,970 --> 01:51:41,970
but we have a saying in the seal teams
plan your dive and dive your plan is the

1709
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:45,590
saying. So when you're, when you're
doing a combat swimmer attack,

1710
01:51:45,591 --> 01:51:50,591
which is when you're on a rebreather and
you're diving underwater and what are,

1711
01:51:51,410 --> 01:51:53,600
if you've never dove before,
if you don't understand this,

1712
01:51:53,601 --> 01:51:56,150
it's very hard to comprehend
what combat swimmer is like.

1713
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:57,800
But I'll give you a real quick brief.

1714
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,250
When you're doing a combat
dive on a rebreather,

1715
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:06,470
you basically can't see
anything. It's nighttime. Hmm.

1716
01:52:06,530 --> 01:52:11,530
You're down at 10 1215 feet underwater.

1717
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:16,850
It's black, you can't see anything.
There's no like fish swimming around.

1718
01:52:16,851 --> 01:52:20,330
There's no sea life to look at.
There's no core reef. It's black,

1719
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,290
you can't see anything.

1720
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:26,300
The only thing you can actually see
is something called an attack board,

1721
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:30,800
which would attack board. Sounds really
cool. But let me tell you what it is.

1722
01:52:31,520 --> 01:52:32,820
It's a piece of plastic.

1723
01:52:33,090 --> 01:52:38,090
He used to be wood that
has on it a depth gauge,

1724
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:42,950
a compass and a watch to time.

1725
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:48,080
And so you put little tiny chem lights,
little glowing chem lights,

1726
01:52:48,081 --> 01:52:51,260
and you're actually tape them up so that
they're barely emitting any light at

1727
01:52:51,261 --> 01:52:55,880
all. And you put one by the
Stopwatch, one by the compass.

1728
01:52:56,030 --> 01:53:00,830
And one by the depth gauge and when you're
underwater. So you have those things,

1729
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:05,600
they're basically strapped onto this board
that you hold. Uh, I dunno, it's like,

1730
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:07,280
like the,
about the size of a piece of paper,

1731
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:08,990
eight and a half by 11 piece of paper.

1732
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,660
That's about how big this board isn't
on it. You've got your depth gauge,

1733
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:15,140
your compass and your stopwatch,
and you can barely see them.

1734
01:53:15,141 --> 01:53:18,950
They're glowing very faintly.
And when you're underwater,

1735
01:53:19,220 --> 01:53:23,480
that's all you can see. It's just
that you can't see anything else.

1736
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:29,410
Occasionally you'll get like some
weird abstract light from the moon or

1737
01:53:29,481 --> 01:53:32,380
something. But even that's rare
because you're down underwater.

1738
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:37,310
And if you've ever been in water with
low visibility sometimes that sometimes

1739
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:40,670
it's actually hard to see the attack board
that's two feet in front of your face.

1740
01:53:41,630 --> 01:53:44,780
So then what you're doing is
you're looking at that compass,

1741
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:47,780
you're looking at that depth gauge and
you're looking at the stopwatch and you

1742
01:53:47,781 --> 01:53:51,890
have preplanned legs that you're going on.

1743
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:55,940
You're going to go this long,
this, this bearing, this long,

1744
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:58,870
this depth for this time.
And when I say it.

1745
01:53:58,871 --> 01:54:03,871
So you're kicking looking at this
board for an hour and 17 minutes,

1746
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,870
then you're going to make a 90 degree
turn and you're going to go for another 48

1747
01:54:08,871 --> 01:54:09,704
minutes,

1748
01:54:09,830 --> 01:54:13,340
and then you're gonna make a right turn
for 12 minutes and you're going to hit

1749
01:54:13,341 --> 01:54:16,520
your target. Then you're gonna turn
around and do some other route back out.

1750
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,520
As long as you can stay underwater and
standard water that eventually you run

1751
01:54:19,521 --> 01:54:22,850
out of oxygen, you come to the t the
surface and you swim the rest of the way.

1752
01:54:22,851 --> 01:54:23,684
Do your extract

1753
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:30,350
any visions of the glory and
the the fun of being a seal.

1754
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:32,330
This is not,

1755
01:54:32,840 --> 01:54:37,840
it's work and it's hard work and you
have to concentrate the whole time and

1756
01:54:38,691 --> 01:54:42,140
you've got to make sure you
don't go too shallow or too deep.

1757
01:54:42,141 --> 01:54:44,240
If you go too shallow, you'll
be seen. If you go too deep,

1758
01:54:44,241 --> 01:54:48,900
you're going to go off the dive tables
that you're allowed to be on oxygen for

1759
01:54:48,901 --> 01:54:51,320
us. So you got to focus the
whole time. And by the way,

1760
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:54,440
you're in this pair and
your buddy that's with you,

1761
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:58,480
he's even more miserable than you are
because he has no idea what's going on.

1762
01:54:58,490 --> 01:55:00,860
He's just trying to keep up with
you because for some reason,

1763
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:04,220
the way you dive for the way you put
your body, when you have the tack board,

1764
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:07,190
you can swim a little bit faster than
the guy that's looking around and making

1765
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:09,230
sure that you're not going to hit
anything and making sure you're not.

1766
01:55:09,950 --> 01:55:14,410
So there's only one tack boards. There's
a one attack board for prepare. Okay.

1767
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:18,410
Sometimes we would make to make a smaller
attack board just because it was so

1768
01:55:18,411 --> 01:55:19,730
much more efficient to fly with them.

1769
01:55:19,731 --> 01:55:23,570
But you can't fly you if
you're the buddy you're,

1770
01:55:23,571 --> 01:55:25,250
you can't be just looking
at the tack board.

1771
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:28,610
You have to look around a tack board.
The attack board, that's what we call it,

1772
01:55:28,611 --> 01:55:32,630
the attack board.
So with all that,

1773
01:55:32,690 --> 01:55:35,660
the reason I'm telling you all this
is that when you're underwater,

1774
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:40,730
it's really easy to get
confused and turned around
and sometimes you go over big

1775
01:55:40,731 --> 01:55:42,530
pieces of metal that are in the water.

1776
01:55:42,530 --> 01:55:46,470
And your compass starts to
like wander around and you're,

1777
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:51,150
you can't communicate with your buddy.
No. That's what it sounds like you've got.

1778
01:55:51,151 --> 01:55:51,541
So we,
you know,

1779
01:55:51,541 --> 01:55:56,541
we have squeezed signals and sometimes
we'd carry a grease pens to write,

1780
01:55:56,641 --> 01:56:00,030
but it's never, there's no real
effective way to communicate underwater.

1781
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,130
So you're just in this dark,

1782
01:56:03,230 --> 01:56:07,410
just cold delined situation.

1783
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:11,220
Four, three, two, three,
four hours at a time.

1784
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:17,420
And the saying is that we had is plan
your dive and dive your plan because if

1785
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:23,010
you and I go under water and then we
start trying to adjust things while we're

1786
01:56:23,011 --> 01:56:24,010
underwater and we just,

1787
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,460
we think we're going to do something
different once we go. First of all,

1788
01:56:26,461 --> 01:56:28,500
you and I are going to be thinking two
different things and it's going to be a

1789
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:30,360
disaster.
So we,

1790
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:35,540
we plan our dive and dive our plan and
that's reminded me of this statement.

1791
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:39,960
Do the business of the day in the day,
right?

1792
01:56:39,961 --> 01:56:44,310
Get done what you say you're going to
get done. Do it. And how simple as that.

1793
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:47,820
And it's like dive your plan. And
what I said the other day, I said,

1794
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:53,220
plan what you're going to do and then
do what you planned. That's real simple.

1795
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:54,640
And,

1796
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:59,640
and think about how far you're going to
think of where you will be in two weeks

1797
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:03,400
if every day you plan what you're gonna
do and then you do what your plan. Yeah.

1798
01:57:03,590 --> 01:57:08,120
It's, it's amazing. Yeah.
It seems so, say that, that,

1799
01:57:08,540 --> 01:57:13,470
that was what we were talking about a few
weeks ago where it's like distractions.

1800
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:17,910
That's the thing, you know, there's like
just industries of distractions. Yeah,

1801
01:57:17,911 --> 01:57:19,470
for sure.
You never wake up.

1802
01:57:19,471 --> 01:57:23,430
I was explaining to my eight year old
daughter the other day that they design,

1803
01:57:23,431 --> 01:57:27,310
cause he was playing a
game on iPad. I said, oh,

1804
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:31,080
what are you learning from that? And
she said, what do you mean? I said,

1805
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:33,970
oh are you learning anything
from that? And she said, well I,

1806
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:36,750
you have to get these
rings. And I said, oh,

1807
01:57:36,751 --> 01:57:41,280
so you're not learning anything from that?
And she said, I don't, I don't. I said,

1808
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:45,120
you know what they do? They make that
game to make you want to play it more.

1809
01:57:45,210 --> 01:57:48,870
There's no, there's no end to the games
to handle it. They just want you to play.

1810
01:57:48,871 --> 01:57:51,740
That can keep clicking on
that. That's there, you know?

1811
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:54,480
And of course I'm just being
a total jerk. I'm like, yeah,

1812
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:59,160
look at how we look at how well it works.
Look at you. See you can't put it down.

1813
01:57:59,161 --> 01:57:59,880
Look at you.

1814
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:03,240
You look at you holding onto this thing
and she doesn't fall for this anymore.

1815
01:58:03,270 --> 01:58:04,110
When she was younger,

1816
01:58:04,111 --> 01:58:09,090
I used to go up and and press her head
as if her head was getting softer and I'd

1817
01:58:09,091 --> 01:58:11,620
look at her like, Oh man, how long
have you been on this? For instance?

1818
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:13,600
I don't know.
And it's a,

1819
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,790
I think if you stopped now your brain
might hardened back up eventually.

1820
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:20,760
I do the same thing with,
with her. Oh, her muscles.

1821
01:58:20,790 --> 01:58:23,810
Like you shouldn't be eating like chips,
just too many chips. There's like,

1822
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:27,870
oh your muscles are getting like all
soft right now. Maria, she's young.

1823
01:58:27,871 --> 01:58:32,020
She's four. So it works. It still
works. But they do, they plan,

1824
01:58:32,070 --> 01:58:34,680
they plan these things so
that they addicted. Yeah.

1825
01:58:34,780 --> 01:58:39,150
Dick those iPad once there is no, well,
everything is designed that, right, right.

1826
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:42,010
You talk about the Facebook
app that shows the little thing

1827
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:43,260
that shows,
oh yeah,

1828
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:47,230
like you're going to mess alert and
this might be the message that I've been

1829
01:58:47,231 --> 01:58:50,710
waiting for it variable reward. It
might not be, so that's the thing.

1830
01:58:50,711 --> 01:58:54,520
That's if you know, guaranteed it
what it's going to be consistently.

1831
01:58:54,521 --> 01:58:57,490
It's less addictive. It's called variable
rewards. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1832
01:58:57,491 --> 01:58:59,940
But you, everyone in their mind
is thinking this might be, ah,

1833
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,460
this place might be the big one.
I'm getting contacted by,

1834
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:08,530
by tenacious d. They saw my
tweet. They're getting back at me.

1835
01:59:08,531 --> 01:59:11,170
They're going to come on the podcast.
She's tenacious.

1836
01:59:11,171 --> 01:59:16,090
D is Jack Black and Kyle gas. Oh, right,
right. Was that a movie? It's a band.

1837
01:59:16,390 --> 01:59:20,820
Okay. From a movie. They
have been in a movie. Yes.

1838
01:59:20,930 --> 01:59:24,660
And they black Jack Black?
No,

1839
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:29,120
that's a second or not. And as a
musician. Okay. Gotcha. School of rock.

1840
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:34,130
That's a great shot of how, that's
not a movie that's Jack Black. No, no.

1841
01:59:34,150 --> 01:59:38,710
He is an actor. Like I said, in addition
to being a board member who, okay. Gotcha.

1842
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:41,800
Cool. Why don't we just
talk about, oh yeah,

1843
01:59:41,801 --> 01:59:44,730
because I think in all of this might
be the tweet that I was waiting for it,

1844
01:59:44,731 --> 01:59:46,270
right.
From tenacious d.

1845
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:51,790
So I gotta check my Twitter 47
times a minute. No, not happening.

1846
01:59:52,510 --> 01:59:56,670
You can't, you don't have a tweet
from tenacious d that's not there.

1847
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:00,160
They didn't treat you.
So don't check your Twitter.

1848
02:00:00,370 --> 02:00:04,520
Go and do something productive. Yeah. So,

1849
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:07,990
and that's when you're already distracted.

1850
02:00:08,260 --> 02:00:11,710
So basically the point was,
you know,

1851
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:15,640
do your plot or plan your day or
do you know and do the plan, right?

1852
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:20,830
Because no one plan your day and
do what you plan. Yeah, that's it.

1853
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:25,110
So yeah, no one plans to work.
What's really jacked up ease.

1854
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:30,120
If you actually took what you did in a
day and you wrote it down and planned it,

1855
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:34,990
I bet you could get it done in so
much last time. Like right now,

1856
02:00:34,991 --> 02:00:38,560
I've got a lot of stuff going on right
now and I'm doing things that normally

1857
02:00:38,561 --> 02:00:42,160
take me two hours.
I'm doing in 46 minutes.

1858
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:46,350
Same quality getting after it,
right?

1859
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:50,860
But you got to put a little suspense
date on something and say, us do here.

1860
02:00:50,940 --> 02:00:53,890
You've got to get it done. And then
you just sit down and make it happen.

1861
02:00:54,340 --> 02:00:58,990
That's what you need to do it. It's
one of those simple, but Anita,

1862
02:00:58,991 --> 02:01:02,350
these easy things. But this is why
it's so you would you put in a way,

1863
02:01:02,351 --> 02:01:07,080
you put these kind of parameters on
what you're going to do and if like if,

1864
02:01:07,110 --> 02:01:10,390
okay, I'm making a plan and I'm sticking
to the plan, right? That's what I'm doing.

1865
02:01:10,420 --> 02:01:14,800
So I plan to do x, Y, Z. Excellent. You
know, all these things. So basically,

1866
02:01:14,801 --> 02:01:19,210
right when you say, okay, here's the plan,
you outline it. If it's not in the plan,

1867
02:01:19,211 --> 02:01:23,590
you just don't do it.
It's so, so distractions.

1868
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:28,270
No one plans like, Hey, tomorrow I'm
going to just eat like crap tomorrow.

1869
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:30,790
That's the plan. That's
never the plan, you know?

1870
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:33,010
But if you don't have any plan or nothing,
sure.

1871
02:01:33,011 --> 02:01:35,530
You allow those things to come
in. So was fear like, okay,

1872
02:01:35,531 --> 02:01:37,720
tomorrow and you're not
going to plan the whole day.

1873
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:40,460
You're not combined every meal
you're going to. If you did,

1874
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:45,360
you'd be real effective.
You'd stay on locked. Right.

1875
02:01:45,380 --> 02:01:47,980
Got so much in the meal prep
the night before. Exactly.

1876
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:51,440
When you go through those phases where
you're cooking seven chicken breasts and

1877
02:01:51,441 --> 02:01:54,620
you're just ready, you got
everything laid out, there you go.

1878
02:01:54,670 --> 02:01:59,610
It's real easy that people do that and it
works. Yes sir. Yeah, exactly right. So,

1879
02:01:59,770 --> 02:02:03,590
and is it realistic and really when
you think about it kind of is if you're

1880
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:07,910
committed to it. Well what's crazy
is is it takes more work upfront.

1881
02:02:08,240 --> 02:02:10,730
How long does it take to prepare all
your meals for the week? And by the way,

1882
02:02:10,731 --> 02:02:13,970
I don't do this,
but how long I've done it before?

1883
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,480
How long does it take to prepare meals?
It takes you two hours,

1884
02:02:17,481 --> 02:02:20,930
two hours and 20 minutes, let's
say at a time. By the way,

1885
02:02:20,931 --> 02:02:24,560
you get done preparing those and
you save time in the week, right?

1886
02:02:24,590 --> 02:02:28,130
Cause now you're not sitting around
redeploying your pots and pans,

1887
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:31,610
redeploying your stove setting,
all that other stuff.

1888
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:36,850
You actually are going to save time if
you plan your day and then you do your

1889
02:02:38,481 --> 02:02:43,280
plan. Yeah. And think about this, if
you use a meal prep example where,

1890
02:02:43,281 --> 02:02:45,710
okay,
you don't typically,

1891
02:02:45,711 --> 02:02:49,460
we don't plan our every meal for
a week two, we just don't do that.

1892
02:02:49,461 --> 02:02:51,410
But when you do the meal
prep planning situation,

1893
02:02:51,411 --> 02:02:56,330
you're saying we meaning human beings
in general, the typical person.

1894
02:02:56,450 --> 02:03:00,530
So that's a good example. So
when you do that now, boom,

1895
02:03:00,531 --> 02:03:01,980
that your meals,
uh,

1896
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:06,470
an element of your life that typically
isn't quote unquote planned is now

1897
02:03:06,471 --> 02:03:09,140
planned. So now they're,
those parameters are sick.

1898
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:10,880
So anything outside of
those parameters do,

1899
02:03:10,881 --> 02:03:13,020
you just don't really think
about it as much, you know?

1900
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,590
And when they kind of enter you,
it's real obvious like, hey,

1901
02:03:15,591 --> 02:03:18,230
that's not part of this plan. What
the hell? You know, it's like,

1902
02:03:18,231 --> 02:03:20,030
it's more of a red flag,
but if you don't plan it,

1903
02:03:20,031 --> 02:03:21,200
they come in and it's
kind of like whatever.

1904
02:03:21,201 --> 02:03:23,180
There was no parameters
there anyway in my head.

1905
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:26,090
So that goes for everything you can do.
So just like how you're saying, yeah,

1906
02:03:26,091 --> 02:03:27,860
I have a lot of stuff. So you plan, okay,

1907
02:03:27,861 --> 02:03:30,170
I'm going to do this here and do this now,
do this at this time,

1908
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:33,290
finish it by this time, all this
stuff, those parameters are set.

1909
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:35,510
So the distractions I've
way harder tend to get it.

1910
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:40,160
So in everyday life you can make some
ambiguous goal. Hey, I want to eat better.

1911
02:03:40,190 --> 02:03:42,980
No plan. By the way, just
it's an ambiguous goal.

1912
02:03:43,010 --> 02:03:47,590
There's those parameters on there.
So you take one misstep, you,

1913
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:51,480
you know you were at the stop
light for longer than you expected,

1914
02:03:51,481 --> 02:03:54,230
and now you're late for this. Now I'm
pressed for time. There's a Mcdonald's,

1915
02:03:54,231 --> 02:03:58,280
right? And it'll just sneak right in.
But if you've got those parameters,

1916
02:03:58,281 --> 02:04:01,190
then you'd be at Mcdonald's. No, not
part of my plan right now. My plan,

1917
02:04:01,191 --> 02:04:03,740
I got to do, got to execute
it. And another thing,

1918
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:08,600
if you're going to plan your day,
you should actually plan to have

1919
02:04:11,090 --> 02:04:14,150
time in there that has nothing
in it, right? So you should,

1920
02:04:14,180 --> 02:04:16,190
you should plan to have a
half an hour where you're,

1921
02:04:16,191 --> 02:04:20,120
where you're going to address
problems. Right. Okay.

1922
02:04:20,121 --> 02:04:22,850
So that way a problems because they're
going to come up, I mean you gotta,

1923
02:04:22,851 --> 02:04:25,640
you gotta have your free time and by free,

1924
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:30,620
I mean free to go make other things
happen and adjust and make things good.

1925
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:32,330
But what you shouldn't do is say,

1926
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:35,660
because I'll tell you there's some
things that I have a really hard time,

1927
02:04:35,690 --> 02:04:38,010
like with the podcast,
I'll

1928
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,750
keep preparing the podcast. I'll just
kill you're carrying it. Like I'll just,

1929
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:46,710
I know I did go beyond that because
there's another story that ties into

1930
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:48,840
something else and I'm going to go
pull out another book. And by the way,

1931
02:04:48,841 --> 02:04:51,060
I got to run,
I don't have time to get it from Amazon,

1932
02:04:51,061 --> 02:04:52,860
so I'm going to go to the library,
you know what I mean?

1933
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:58,280
You go down where I could prepare for a
podcast forever and not be ready for it.

1934
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:01,050
And so I have to put my own
self and check and say, okay,

1935
02:05:01,290 --> 02:05:04,920
draw the line on this level
of depth on this thing.

1936
02:05:04,921 --> 02:05:09,921
Now I might make a footnote and I've kind
of cool category now on my computer of

1937
02:05:10,051 --> 02:05:12,720
that's you know,
tangents where I,

1938
02:05:12,721 --> 02:05:16,080
where I opened a tangent and I
didn't close it on the podcast.

1939
02:05:16,081 --> 02:05:19,230
So now we're going to be able to
enter them at a different time when,

1940
02:05:19,830 --> 02:05:23,940
when time allows, because I can
get focused on that one subject.

1941
02:05:24,630 --> 02:05:25,463
So that's pretty cool.

1942
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:30,210
But it takes discipline to do that
because otherwise I would just go down,

1943
02:05:30,211 --> 02:05:33,540
every rabbit hole is opened up and you
take a book like this and there's so many

1944
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:36,270
rabbit holes and there it's almost
impossible to stay out of them.

1945
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:40,140
Gets kind of ridiculous. Yeah. In a way.

1946
02:05:40,920 --> 02:05:43,050
So my point is

1947
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:48,240
plan your day and then execute your plan.
If you do that,

1948
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:51,420
it's going to make a huge
difference in your life.

1949
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:56,250
And what's cool did you look
up, you look up in a month,

1950
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,620
two months,
three months,

1951
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:01,680
the amount of stuff that you've
gotten done as ridiculous.

1952
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:06,230
And I'll tell you one of the ways that
I do do that myself as I just put tasked

1953
02:06:06,231 --> 02:06:09,930
myself with the, I say I'm going to do
things and then would have to do them.

1954
02:06:10,050 --> 02:06:14,730
Yeah, they are great. That Pie, if let's
say with this podcast, a good example,

1955
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:19,170
we do this podcast once a week.
We've held the line really well on that.

1956
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:22,020
If we didn't, if we said, you know what,

1957
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:26,790
let's just put the podcast
out when we put it out.

1958
02:06:27,210 --> 02:06:31,440
If that was the mindset we had from
the beginning, we would probably,

1959
02:06:31,740 --> 02:06:36,740
I'm going to guess that we would have
less than half of the podcasts would have

1960
02:06:36,961 --> 02:06:39,780
been put out. That's my guess because
we noticed said, you know what?

1961
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:43,800
Hey I got to train this week and I'm
going to miss that and I haven't read the

1962
02:06:43,801 --> 02:06:47,850
book that I was going to read
so cause right now bro, the, Oh,

1963
02:06:47,851 --> 02:06:52,080
I've got 15 minutes, that little half
hour of my schedule where I have nothing,

1964
02:06:52,081 --> 02:06:54,930
guess what I'm doing in that half an hour
I'm doing 22 minutes worth of reading

1965
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:57,750
of a book that's coming up.
That's what I'm doing.

1966
02:06:58,170 --> 02:07:01,260
If we didn't have the
discipline structure in place,

1967
02:07:01,590 --> 02:07:03,850
that probably wouldn't be happening.
Yeah.

1968
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:06,140
That probably wouldn't be
happy we'd be going to,

1969
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:09,350
you know what little time went by.
Hey Bro. Yeah, let's, let's, let's,

1970
02:07:09,420 --> 02:07:12,870
let's give this week of miss it
so much easier. You know what?

1971
02:07:12,871 --> 02:07:16,440
I was going to go hang out today and
don't really want to do this today. No,

1972
02:07:16,441 --> 02:07:20,610
we're doing it. We, we signed
up for it. Yeah, totally. Now,

1973
02:07:21,030 --> 02:07:22,560
could it get to a point where we say,
you know what,

1974
02:07:22,650 --> 02:07:25,200
every two weeks we've
mentioned that before.

1975
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:31,140
People didn't like that idea.
Yeah. Wealth didn't like that idea.

1976
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:34,500
I didn't like that. I knew better. You
know why? Cause I liked that discipline.

1977
02:07:34,640 --> 02:07:37,180
Yeah. Why would you know
why? Because I'm basically,

1978
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:41,470
I'm basically confining myself to doing
something productive as opposed to

1979
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:46,471
watching youtube videos about cats
because there's some great youtube videos,

1980
02:07:47,380 --> 02:07:49,630
right?
There's some good youtube videos,

1981
02:07:50,290 --> 02:07:55,290
but there's also a lot of them are not
good and you're not getting anything out

1982
02:07:55,691 --> 02:07:57,220
of them. Yeah. And Man,

1983
02:07:57,221 --> 02:08:01,630
the ones that they rack up for you
when you've just got done watching one,

1984
02:08:03,160 --> 02:08:06,010
the ones that they rack up for you all,
every single one of them,

1985
02:08:06,130 --> 02:08:06,790
what did they rack up?

1986
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:09,880
I think they rack up for on top and
four on bottom on your little screen.

1987
02:08:10,510 --> 02:08:13,450
And every one of 'em is,
is like a clickbait. Right?

1988
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:17,930
Every one of them is a click
clickbait. It's crazy. Yeah. It's,

1989
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:20,380
they do the obvious.
They are brilliant. Yeah.

1990
02:08:20,381 --> 02:08:25,120
Because it has a lot to do with everything
that you've, you've walked for sure.

1991
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:29,860
So yeah, it's going to be the neck. The
video is always just like, it's a month,

1992
02:08:29,861 --> 02:08:34,480
90% relevant to what you specifically
one right there. And that is why.

1993
02:08:34,630 --> 02:08:38,510
That is why you got to get angry at the,
you know, you know, you have that, uh,

1994
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,970
you know how you have that,

1995
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:45,090
that way that you overcame your
anger, my anger management. Right.

1996
02:08:45,130 --> 02:08:48,070
But you read that it was
like you had low self esteem.

1997
02:08:48,071 --> 02:08:50,710
That's why you're getting
mad. Well, when you get that,

1998
02:08:50,770 --> 02:08:54,550
when you get that next rack of
youtube videos staring at you,

1999
02:08:54,940 --> 02:08:58,120
you should be getting pissed because
you know what they're trying to do.

2000
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:02,590
They're trying to get you to try to take
your time away from you. And by the way,

2001
02:09:02,591 --> 02:09:05,260
they're making money from it. When you
click that next thing they're making,

2002
02:09:05,261 --> 02:09:07,870
they're making money from what
you're doing. And so they've,

2003
02:09:07,930 --> 02:09:11,290
they've set this system up to
make you click that thing. Yeah.

2004
02:09:11,291 --> 02:09:12,970
So you're a mark is what you want.

2005
02:09:12,971 --> 02:09:17,220
All you are mark [inaudible] look at
you falling for it every single day.

2006
02:09:17,830 --> 02:09:20,920
That's how I quit drinking too, by
the way. That is legit. Like, Oh,

2007
02:09:20,921 --> 02:09:23,290
I'm falling for a trick that
my brain is playing on me.

2008
02:09:23,970 --> 02:09:28,000
I ain't falling for that trick and falling
for that trick. That, and like I said,

2009
02:09:28,001 --> 02:09:28,870
it's hard to,

2010
02:09:28,871 --> 02:09:33,250
because it's mixed in with
positive stuff on youtube.

2011
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,860
They're really good
quality stuff on Youtube.

2012
02:09:35,861 --> 02:09:39,010
There's some great knowledge you
can gain from Youtube for sure.

2013
02:09:39,190 --> 02:09:42,340
And if you're good at justifying
things, yeah, that's true too.

2014
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,390
It's a really scary,

2015
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:48,250
but my point is I don't want us to sit
here and bag on youtube because it's an

2016
02:09:48,251 --> 02:09:52,900
incredible source of information
if you keep it informational,

2017
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:58,080
but it's real easy to get sideways on
that and they somehow know they can attach

2018
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:04,120
like watching a street fight too. Cause
I watched street fights or I watch, uh,

2019
02:10:04,690 --> 02:10:07,580
you know, a UFC fight or I'll watch
a clip or I'll watch a submission.

2020
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:12,900
They know how to drag you in to like those
click bait titles of the guy fighting

2021
02:10:15,020 --> 02:10:19,210
the kangaroo. Yeah, man
versus kangaroo. Unbelievable.

2022
02:10:19,900 --> 02:10:22,420
Right. And of course you're
thinking yourself, okay,

2023
02:10:22,421 --> 02:10:25,540
well what would I do if I didn't fight
her kangaroo? I live in America, man.

2024
02:10:25,560 --> 02:10:28,150
I'm not fighting any Kangaroos, but
somehow I've got to click on that video.

2025
02:10:29,070 --> 02:10:31,420
Such garbage. So good job. Youtube.

2026
02:10:32,470 --> 02:10:34,100
And I'm

2027
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:36,980
not going to be a soccer over
here. Nope, not it will be a mark.

2028
02:10:37,010 --> 02:10:40,230
Give yourself a limit. Yeah,
see and that goes back to what,

2029
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:43,380
give yourself like a clique
limit on those things. Yeah.

2030
02:10:43,790 --> 02:10:47,180
Or just set your plan right. Give
yourself those parameters. Right.

2031
02:10:47,181 --> 02:10:51,230
You won't even me thinking
about it right now. It really,

2032
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,210
after you kind of explained it there,

2033
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:56,600
it really puts it into perspective
and all the things he ever,

2034
02:10:56,601 --> 02:10:58,700
I mean you're different than I think.

2035
02:10:58,701 --> 02:11:02,930
I think a lot of people where sometimes
people only make plans if like they have

2036
02:11:02,931 --> 02:11:06,320
important stuff. Something
that's important. I got
work stuff where I got it,

2037
02:11:06,321 --> 02:11:08,990
I got this to do list.
There's like 10 things on the list,

2038
02:11:08,991 --> 02:11:13,010
which actually seems like a pretty big
to do lists. If you think 10 in one day,

2039
02:11:13,880 --> 02:11:18,880
you know how many things you do in a
day that you can get distracted from.

2040
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:23,840
A lot of them. Yeah, more than 10 it's
like a lot and that got everything.

2041
02:11:23,841 --> 02:11:27,730
Everything from like what the day
you wake up or not the day, but the,

2042
02:11:27,731 --> 02:11:32,360
the time you wake up, what you eat
every single time, by the way. Well,

2043
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:37,400
the TV you watch or don't watch like
it's every, every second of the day.

2044
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:39,710
If it had a parameter on it,
oh man.

2045
02:11:39,711 --> 02:11:44,711
You'd be just laser focus on all your
goals instead of these ambiguous lose

2046
02:11:45,681 --> 02:11:50,270
weight or I want to, I need
to, I dunno. Xyz more. Yeah.

2047
02:11:50,430 --> 02:11:53,870
And I'll tell you another thing that the
plan doesn't take that much time to put

2048
02:11:53,871 --> 02:11:58,610
together. Yeah. And how you said it's,
it'll end up saving you time. Oh for sure.

2049
02:11:58,611 --> 02:11:59,960
We don't end up in one way or another.

2050
02:11:59,961 --> 02:12:04,820
We'll 10 minutes that you spend planning
the next day we'll save you four hours.

2051
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:09,230
You can usually get done everything you
have to get done in like a half the time.

2052
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:14,060
Half the time. It's crazy. And it's
weird too because I had no thought there.

2053
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,710
I don't want to make it
sound like there's some,

2054
02:12:16,190 --> 02:12:20,030
some people that are really busy.
Yeah. But I had a single mom,

2055
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:24,500
she's got two, three kids.
She's got two, three jobs.

2056
02:12:24,980 --> 02:12:27,620
She doesn't, you know what? She's
listened this conversation going. Yeah,

2057
02:12:27,621 --> 02:12:31,250
no kidding. Okay. Youtube.
Yeah. She's in the game.

2058
02:12:31,251 --> 02:12:36,000
24 seven not choosing the game.
20 cause she's warm. She sleeps.

2059
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:40,410
She's keeping it together.
Yeah. And when you say there's

2060
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:47,240
two things to that, yeah. There are busy
people. You know how those get those,

2061
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:49,160
like the single moms or the single dads,

2062
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:52,580
they get kind of like what I just said.

2063
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:56,810
They are in a situation,
they have no choice and they get after it.

2064
02:12:57,160 --> 02:12:59,030
I have no choice and they
get after they were like, oh,

2065
02:12:59,031 --> 02:13:01,550
I'm going to get this done. They got
their frame. They're looking at their kid,

2066
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:05,600
they're looking at their three year old
kid that that three year old kid has

2067
02:13:05,601 --> 02:13:10,601
nothing without that mom getting on the
grind and go into the the restaurant and

2068
02:13:13,670 --> 02:13:18,090
working as a waitress or whatever
or she's working her job,

2069
02:13:18,120 --> 02:13:22,640
whatever she's doing. Yeah. Just putting
it together knows exactly Tuesday,

2070
02:13:22,641 --> 02:13:27,410
three weeks from now I'm at four 46
she knows where she's going to be.

2071
02:13:27,740 --> 02:13:30,890
She knows exactly where me, I
mean I don't come on, you know,

2072
02:13:30,900 --> 02:13:32,040
compared to the average person

2073
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:36,660
we don't know. And then Kimberly
average was it. You did it right.

2074
02:13:36,661 --> 02:13:40,920
You're not even like 100% sure which could
be doing in an hour because you know,

2075
02:13:40,921 --> 02:13:45,090
cruising could interlude at any time
and you might just be cruising is a very

2076
02:13:45,091 --> 02:13:46,460
ambiguous activity.

2077
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:51,450
The but then go to the other side of
the spectrum of busy people. I mean,

2078
02:13:51,810 --> 02:13:55,440
they're busy because they don't plan
enough. It's definitely true. Yeah.

2079
02:13:55,480 --> 02:13:58,890
I'm so busy all the time. Meanwhile,
no, no productivity, you know,

2080
02:13:59,330 --> 02:14:03,330
or very little limited, limited, true.

2081
02:14:04,590 --> 02:14:08,070
Plan your day. Execute
your plan. All right, last

2082
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:13,770
little quote from this.
This is Frederick the great,

2083
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:19,880
the battle of calling in 1757 and
there were some troops that were,

2084
02:14:23,250 --> 02:14:26,190
I read a couple of different versions.
Again, speaking of rabbit holes,

2085
02:14:26,191 --> 02:14:29,190
we start going down these rabbit holes.
I read two different versions of this.

2086
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:33,660
There was either troops that
were hesitating to attack
or there were troops that

2087
02:14:33,661 --> 02:14:37,710
were actually retreating
and to these troops.

2088
02:14:37,711 --> 02:14:39,300
Frederick the great said,

2089
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:43,530
dogs would you live forever

2090
02:14:45,810 --> 02:14:50,160
and another way that was translated
was you curse it rascals.

2091
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:54,880
Would you live forever? And
who is he saying? This student,

2092
02:14:54,890 --> 02:14:59,890
he's saying that to his own troops that
are leaving either either hesitating to

2093
02:15:00,931 --> 02:15:04,980
attack, right or they're or they're
retreating and he's saying dogs. Yeah,

2094
02:15:05,010 --> 02:15:09,420
Conan the barbarian. No.
Would you live forever?

2095
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:13,770
No. Is that what you're looking for? To
live forever? Yeah. No, you shouldn't be.

2096
02:15:15,940 --> 02:15:16,390
Yeah.

2097
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:21,190
And you know, I think that's a
good way to still wrap up that book

2098
02:15:22,990 --> 02:15:23,830
because like we said,

2099
02:15:24,550 --> 02:15:28,930
those two quotes always do the
business of the day in the day.

2100
02:15:31,620 --> 02:15:35,190
So plan where you do
and do what you plan and

2101
02:15:37,450 --> 02:15:40,450
dogs.
You curse it rascals.

2102
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:44,410
Would you live forever?
Let me answer that for you.

2103
02:15:44,470 --> 02:15:45,550
No you won't.

2104
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:51,450
And we're here talking about a book.

2105
02:15:51,451 --> 02:15:54,450
We're talking about a book today and we
talk about leadership and that's awesome.

2106
02:15:54,451 --> 02:15:57,360
But you've got to start
by leading yourself

2107
02:15:59,760 --> 02:16:04,560
by doing what you say you will do.
That's integrity,

2108
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:05,790
personal integrity.

2109
02:16:05,791 --> 02:16:09,480
When you say that you're going to do
something that they've talked about being

2110
02:16:09,481 --> 02:16:11,550
straight today,
I talked about personal integrity.

2111
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:16,670
That starts with yourself by doing what
you actually say you are going to do by

2112
02:16:19,021 --> 02:16:22,200
not hesitating and waiting.

2113
02:16:24,190 --> 02:16:27,540
Get a lead yourself.
So

2114
02:16:28,460 --> 02:16:28,960
yeah,

2115
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:29,950
get moving.

2116
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:31,000
Don't wait.

2117
02:16:32,260 --> 02:16:35,380
Do what you plan and do it today

2118
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:41,690
because you don't get to live forever

2119
02:16:43,790 --> 02:16:46,940
and the clock is ticking

2120
02:16:50,730 --> 02:16:55,730
and I think that's all I've
got for tonight and echo
since we are not hesitating

2121
02:16:58,051 --> 02:16:58,531
right now.

2122
02:16:58,531 --> 02:17:03,531
If you could without hesitation to please
explain to people how they might be

2123
02:17:04,801 --> 02:17:07,740
able to support

2124
02:17:09,450 --> 02:17:12,900
this podcast if they weren't too sure.
Of course,

2125
02:17:14,970 --> 02:17:18,000
because we don't want to live forever.
I guess that doesn't mean

2126
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:20,230
actually Conan the
barbarian didn't say that.

2127
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:25,030
He didn't say he didn't say much in
Conan the barbarian as a few lines,

2128
02:17:25,031 --> 02:17:28,450
but not that much.
His girlfriend,

2129
02:17:29,860 --> 02:17:33,730
girl, that ends up being his girlfriend.
Then she dies later, but whatever.

2130
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:36,340
She says,
tell me the whole time

2131
02:17:38,470 --> 02:17:42,040
when they hesitate or when they're
about to do something nuts. She says,

2132
02:17:42,041 --> 02:17:45,070
do you want to live forever? Then they
just charge. Oh, okay. Well there you go.

2133
02:17:45,071 --> 02:17:49,570
A couple she she gets. Exactly.
Yeah. That's the exact usage. Anyway,

2134
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,510
speaking of not hesitating,

2135
02:17:52,810 --> 02:17:57,670
so kettle bells I'm talking about on it,
but this is kind of is relevant.

2136
02:17:57,700 --> 02:18:01,660
Reminded me, I kind of mentioned it
earlier before we started recording, so

2137
02:18:03,820 --> 02:18:07,900
I hear good things, right?
Kettlebells and I'm a little familiar,

2138
02:18:07,901 --> 02:18:11,440
I'll incorporate them here and there,
but you know,

2139
02:18:11,441 --> 02:18:15,700
I'm just here more and more so I'm like,
Hey, I'm going to make this part of the,

2140
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:18,310
you know, the routine. The program.

2141
02:18:18,430 --> 02:18:22,690
Yeah. You do kettle bells obviously. Yes.

2142
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:27,560
Do you, how much dumbbell
stuff Dee do like dumbbells.

2143
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:31,750
I actually don't use a lot of weight
belts. Big Dumb Bell Guy. Yeah,

2144
02:18:32,410 --> 02:18:37,040
like even like bench, right man,
when was the last time I bench?

2145
02:18:37,070 --> 02:18:41,620
Like people will say, hey, how much can
you bench? I don't know man. Not Enough.

2146
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:46,360
That's my answer. It's a long time
ago. Anyway, back to the countable,

2147
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:48,580
so starting kettle bells,

2148
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:54,130
but I got him, you know, he'd learned
the tip. Be careful with kettlebells.

2149
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:58,640
If you're doing the kettle bells, you know
how they say yes, start off light. This,

2150
02:18:58,670 --> 02:19:01,070
I'd say with kettlebells more so than it,

2151
02:19:01,190 --> 02:19:02,840
because when you throw a Kelly that thing,

2152
02:19:02,841 --> 02:19:06,770
it's not like a dumbbell is like you
grab a Dumbbell, it has a perfect handle.

2153
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:10,910
Each side of the dumbbells,
perfectly balanced, same exact way,

2154
02:19:11,050 --> 02:19:14,090
but kettle bell has a handle that
it's on the thing. It'll flip around,

2155
02:19:14,091 --> 02:19:17,570
it'll break your Libra, you can break
your hand or when you're swinging them,

2156
02:19:17,571 --> 02:19:20,300
you know the one that you go, I
don't know all the terms, sorry,

2157
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:23,450
but the one you grab it
with a two kettlebells,

2158
02:19:23,510 --> 02:19:27,060
the basic one between your legs,
Brown.

2159
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:29,750
I'm like swinging it and
I'm like, Bro, what if this,

2160
02:19:29,751 --> 02:19:33,860
what if my balance was off or I dunno,
whatever, and the Kettlebell hit my shin.

2161
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:37,460
You'd be a lot of pain.
It can break your Shin if you don't,

2162
02:19:37,660 --> 02:19:41,660
even if it had like a 62 pound
kettlebell you and break your shit.

2163
02:19:41,690 --> 02:19:43,340
Be careful with that.
Anyway,

2164
02:19:44,330 --> 02:19:47,390
so to make things actually,

2165
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:49,960
technically they're not
what I got the Onnit ones,

2166
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:52,940
the Werewolf and the chimp and all that.

2167
02:19:53,570 --> 02:19:56,570
And you think when you compare
them to the regular kettlebells,

2168
02:19:57,080 --> 02:20:01,310
the kettle bells around,
right. The regular ones. And
so you'd think, oh, you know,

2169
02:20:01,390 --> 02:20:03,440
the design and once with a werewolf,

2170
02:20:03,441 --> 02:20:06,710
they might be kind of awkward cause
they're not like perfectly uniform.

2171
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:11,780
But guess what? The balanced
when they make them. Yeah.

2172
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:16,270
So they're just as safe.
But be careful. Um, I'm,

2173
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:19,510
I'm explaining the new,
uh,

2174
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:25,130
emergence of kettle bells in my
workout. Yeah. And you like him?

2175
02:20:25,310 --> 02:20:28,610
I like him a lot and the point
is don't hesitate. Right.

2176
02:20:28,611 --> 02:20:29,720
Cause you know how you
know, he's like, yeah,

2177
02:20:29,740 --> 02:20:34,190
I need to do more kettlebells and big
and big ewas goal. That's what it is.

2178
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:37,760
No parameters. But I was like, you know
what? Today's the day I'm going to do,

2179
02:20:37,761 --> 02:20:42,410
I'm going to, this is going to be the
workout. My workout was, you want numbers,

2180
02:20:42,411 --> 02:20:46,700
I'll give you numbers.
So what I did, metcon,

2181
02:20:47,700 --> 02:20:52,520
kettle bells, the Werewolf. So those are
62 pounds each ad to the double boom.

2182
02:20:52,521 --> 02:20:57,500
So, uh, Dee Dee, I don't know if this is
an actual kettle bill official movement.

2183
02:20:57,560 --> 02:20:59,720
I think it is. You go, it's
like a kettle bell swing.

2184
02:20:59,721 --> 02:21:01,670
Two of them outside of the hips,

2185
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:06,410
narrow stance up to clean,
clean it,

2186
02:21:06,470 --> 02:21:11,050
right. And then press and press it right.
And then back down slot boom, boom. Okay.

2187
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:11,901
Nebraska.
Yes.

2188
02:21:11,901 --> 02:21:16,901
So I do five reps and then
five burpees walk in a circle.

2189
02:21:19,041 --> 02:21:23,510
35 seconds. All right. Five reps again.

2190
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:27,840
So I do that six times.
Took like, I don't know,

2191
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:30,620
eight minutes, eight and a
half minutes. That was a mess.

2192
02:21:30,621 --> 02:21:33,710
So same as my other Macron bolt with the
kettle bells and this kind of the squat

2193
02:21:34,520 --> 02:21:38,000
probably. It's weird. I used
to do that with a bar. It's,

2194
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:42,850
there's a lot of little muscles in
there that makes kettlebells good.

2195
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:44,130
Is that the one stable?

2196
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:48,930
They're less stable than a bar
bell and they move awkwardly. Yeah.

2197
02:21:49,010 --> 02:21:53,720
So you have to use more energy and more
strength to keep them under control.

2198
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:56,570
So it's working some muscles that
you're not used to it most likely. Yeah.

2199
02:21:56,571 --> 02:21:59,840
And you're, it's, it's interesting
because you're using, like,

2200
02:22:00,890 --> 02:22:03,200
you can get into this kind of,
it's not weird,

2201
02:22:03,201 --> 02:22:07,490
but this flow of like,
you don't,

2202
02:22:07,491 --> 02:22:10,640
like when it swings down, it's not
like, oh, it doesn't jerk you down.

2203
02:22:10,670 --> 02:22:12,110
It will if you're not ready for it.

2204
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:14,750
But if you kind of know after you
get used to it, it just flows.

2205
02:22:14,750 --> 02:22:19,490
It's like this almost no impact
via kettle bells are good. Yeah.

2206
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:23,900
So do that anyway. Where would
you get your kettle bells from?

2207
02:22:24,200 --> 02:22:26,730
I get my kettle bells from on it.

2208
02:22:26,790 --> 02:22:29,940
I only get the corns actually
afterwards and I had a picture.

2209
02:22:29,941 --> 02:22:31,800
I was going to post it online
too, but I was thinking, yeah,

2210
02:22:32,660 --> 02:22:36,450
you want to feel it was less about
that at that point, you know? Um,

2211
02:22:36,840 --> 02:22:40,560
but I, again, the Werewolf ones,

2212
02:22:40,980 --> 02:22:45,090
so in Joe Rogan on one of the videos
on there, he kind of mentioned this,

2213
02:22:45,091 --> 02:22:46,980
he's like,
I like this one because it's like,

2214
02:22:46,981 --> 02:22:49,200
I think it was like the gorilla
or something like that. He's like,

2215
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:53,190
it looks at you and it's like
it wants to do. He says, yeah,

2216
02:22:54,210 --> 02:22:57,330
he says that the grill looks like
he wants to bite your dick off.

2217
02:22:57,510 --> 02:23:01,140
That's what he says. Something along
this line. But he has a good point.

2218
02:23:01,141 --> 02:23:02,880
Like those kettle bells, the
bells when you're like, man,

2219
02:23:02,881 --> 02:23:05,790
I really don't want to do this. And then
they're just looking at you, you know,

2220
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,500
and you're like, Dang, you walk away,

2221
02:23:07,501 --> 02:23:10,410
you come back and you look at it and
it's still looking at you with the same

2222
02:23:10,411 --> 02:23:13,800
expression because it's, you know,
Kettlebell, cause it's an inanimate object

2223
02:23:16,650 --> 02:23:21,520
and saying it helps. Yeah. You know, cause
you get into the workout, you know? Yeah.

2224
02:23:21,570 --> 02:23:25,500
You know, especially like how you, you're
like, it's a challenge every time. Anyway.

2225
02:23:25,560 --> 02:23:28,720
Do that. All right on it. Support Right.

2226

2229
02:23:47,660 --> 02:23:50,690
mine didn't come in yet. I slacked it,
went to wine. It didn't come in yet.

2230
02:23:50,720 --> 02:23:55,310
And I'm kind of, it's weird. I'm slowly
started. I'm not messed up. I'm not,

2231
02:23:55,311 --> 02:23:59,030
but I'm slowly starting to, yeah, I
think so. Huh. Actually want to go.

got to reincorporate into it. Yeah.

2234
02:24:05,540 --> 02:24:08,460
I think it takes about six days.
Yeah. In Mike Case, it took really,

2235
02:24:08,470 --> 02:24:12,430
it took I think five when I start
to be like all this different.

2257
02:25:31,991 --> 02:25:34,930
The book that I read, Oh, you
put that on there? I didn't yet.

2258
02:25:35,260 --> 02:25:39,490
The author is Michael Powell, and
here's the thing, it's not like it's,

2259
02:25:39,630 --> 02:25:42,970
it's not like a typical book where
it's like talks about anger management.

2260
02:25:42,971 --> 02:25:43,900
It's not that it's,

2261
02:25:44,290 --> 02:25:49,290
it's literally like there's little games
like mind brain exercises in there,

2262
02:25:49,661 --> 02:25:52,270
you know, it's just everything
and they're really short chapters.

2263
02:25:52,430 --> 02:25:56,890
They're just little things in that one
chapter happened to be about dealing with

2264
02:25:56,891 --> 02:26:00,910
anger. Anyway, Michael Powell is the
author on though. That was a good,

2265
02:26:00,911 --> 02:26:04,870
I'll put it on there though. Legit.
So, yeah. Anyway, Amazon Click through.

2266
02:26:04,871 --> 02:26:07,170
Basically you clicked through
there. Boom. Takes Amazon. It's a,

2267
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:09,850
it's a little support thing,
you know, small action,

2268
02:26:09,851 --> 02:26:13,060
big reaction or if you do other
shopping on their duct tape,

2269
02:26:13,210 --> 02:26:16,990
duct tape if you will. So
yeah. Any shopping really.
But you know, these books,

2270
02:26:16,991 --> 02:26:20,500
that's a good, that's a real relevant
one. I think that people, um, you know,

2271
02:26:20,501 --> 02:26:24,100
they do want to, to grab these books
and boom, they're on their offer.

2272
02:26:24,700 --> 02:26:29,320
I'm also subscribe to the podcast if
you haven't already. Itunes, stitcher,

2273
02:26:29,321 --> 02:26:33,970
Google play, whichever one you prefer.
I think iTunes is the most popular, but

2274
02:26:35,530 --> 02:26:40,530
I see significant references to
Google play in general society,

2275
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:44,860
you know, also a lot of
temperature. Stitcher. Yeah.

2276
02:26:44,920 --> 02:26:48,100
Do you know how like a lot of times
people, they don't want to go mainstream,

2277
02:26:48,280 --> 02:26:52,260
you know? Oh yeah. It's like, like
they like to keep it old school.

2278
02:26:52,270 --> 02:26:56,050
Hard underground. Yeah. You
know, it makes sense. You know,

2279
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:01,720
what's the old saying? Don't go with their
herd or path less traveled, you know,

2280
02:27:01,721 --> 02:27:05,710
one of those, all those same, same deal,
same deal. So I get it. Google play.

2281
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:10,630
But good news is we're on all of
them. Boom. Choose your your avenue.

2282
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:13,150
Also Youtube.

2283
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:16,690
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel.

2284
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:19,390
We do have you youtube
channel talk about every week,

2285
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:24,480
but it not only does it have a video
version of this podcast has excerpts and

2286
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,190
deluxe serps or do those
excerpts that you have enhanced.

2287
02:27:30,191 --> 02:27:33,640
We'll just say enhanced depth
excerpts also. You know what man,

2288
02:27:33,670 --> 02:27:37,900
I have this other idea. You know what
I'm going to do? I'm to make little,

2289
02:27:39,790 --> 02:27:42,970
we'll just say other little videos too.
That's what I'm going to stick.

2290
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,310
Bad add value,
so to speak like that.

2291
02:27:45,670 --> 02:27:50,670
Well the video is a very compelling
form of interaction with people.

2292
02:27:53,690 --> 02:27:55,210
That's why,
that's why Youtube,

2293
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:59,590
I think youtube is like the most
search to website, bigger than,

2294
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:02,890
it's more searched than Google.
Maybe I'm wrong, but it's up there.

2295
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:05,980
If it's not number one, it's number
two. So if you want to learn something,

2296
02:28:05,981 --> 02:28:08,890
people immediately, yes,
I searched youtube. Yeah,

2297
02:28:08,891 --> 02:28:11,890
that's what I guess what you remember the
other day we talked about youtube red.

2298
02:28:12,130 --> 02:28:16,720
Yeah, I got youtube red. Oh, I'll buy
because the ads, the ads is one thing,

2299
02:28:16,750 --> 02:28:21,750
but also because you can listen to
music without it being on the screen.

2300
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:27,720
It plays in the background like iTunes
that is that the main reason now I can

2301
02:28:27,721 --> 02:28:28,640
get any album that,

2302
02:28:29,050 --> 02:28:32,600
cause a lot of the music is a lot of
music that I listened to isn't on iTunes

2303
02:28:32,870 --> 02:28:36,350
because it's old school. It's
hardcore. It's underground,

2304
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:39,800
like literally not on there,
but the youtube videos up there crazy.

2305
02:28:39,870 --> 02:28:44,870
It's a youtube video will be on there
from some random hardcore band from New

2306
02:28:47,330 --> 02:28:51,490
York, upstate New York and
they're there. They're there.

2307
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:53,000
One album that they made,

2308
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:58,030
the one e p five songs long that
came out in 1987 it'll be on youtube.

2309
02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:05,090
It's not anywhere near iTunes. It's on
it and you can play it, which is awesome.

2310
02:29:05,820 --> 02:29:06,653
Makes Sense.

2311
02:29:07,250 --> 02:29:11,680
I guess they youtube red sometimes they'll
put or not something to all the time.

2312
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:13,160
Do you have youtube red? No. No,

2313
02:29:13,730 --> 02:29:17,900
because the main selling point problem
is that the albums without tracks,

2314
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:23,560
just Fyi, you like albums with tracks.
These are alphabetic without tracks.

2315
02:29:23,620 --> 02:29:28,580
Well typically I don't listen to Youtube
for the music situation where I'd go to,

2316
02:29:28,581 --> 02:29:32,420
if you have red you will change that.
Maybe I mean red, they push it with hey,

2317
02:29:32,421 --> 02:29:35,420
no ads and then I'm like
cool, no ads. But man,

2318
02:29:35,421 --> 02:29:37,520
I'm not that quick to
jump on the no Ed's thing.

2319
02:29:37,720 --> 02:29:40,400
There had been plenty of times
for a lot of times with movies,

2320
02:29:40,490 --> 02:29:42,530
but the ads that play,

2321
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:46,340
I all like it'll be for me
directly for me. Like Dang,

2322
02:29:46,341 --> 02:29:48,470
this ad is helping me in a way.

2323
02:29:48,470 --> 02:29:52,790
Sometimes the ultimate youtube
person battling maybe a quick,

2324
02:29:52,791 --> 02:29:57,380
the next video I'm going to enjoy the
advertisement. The Tai Lopez adds a lot,

2325
02:29:57,381 --> 02:30:01,550
you know that is right. Tai Lopez,
he's a um, he's super smart guy.

2326
02:30:01,580 --> 02:30:05,240
He's actually one of the reasons
why like I started reading a lot,

2327
02:30:05,480 --> 02:30:09,530
like one of the reasons and so smart
guy pled his ads are all over youtube,

2328
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:13,250
but I know it's my fault because it's
relevant to what I watch apparently.

2329
02:30:13,540 --> 02:30:17,630
You know how they do that. So it's
my fault, but those are the ads.

2330
02:30:17,631 --> 02:30:21,680
I get tired of this shit. You go to
college, you know what I'm talking about.

2331
02:30:21,800 --> 02:30:25,180
Anyway. Um, yeah. So yeah,
subscribe to our youtube, you know,

2332
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:27,970
got some subscribers on this.
Some good feedback, you know,

2333
02:30:27,971 --> 02:30:29,450
having to keep posting videos.

2334
02:30:29,990 --> 02:30:34,990
It does help that people will say echo
post videos in addition to just use

2335
02:30:35,610 --> 02:30:39,790
requesting peer pressure
like that. That's good. Yeah.

2336
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:44,750
Um, so yeah, so I've tried to be need to,
that's a good, uh, also Jack was a store.

2337
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:49,730
It was called Jocko store.
Jocko store.com on there.

2338
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:53,750
We have t shirts. If you wear tee
shirts, you know, check them out.

2339
02:30:54,410 --> 02:30:57,620
If you're interested in anything on there,
get something. I'm not saying a bias,

2340
02:30:57,660 --> 02:31:00,770
I'm not saying, hey guys, go to
[inaudible] dot com and buy a t shirt.

2341
02:31:00,771 --> 02:31:04,400
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying go to Jocko store.com.

2342
02:31:05,270 --> 02:31:09,230
There's some shirts on their hoodies,
on their rash guards, patches,

2343
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:14,270
some women's stuff, some tank
tops and whatnot. Travel mugs,

2344
02:31:15,890 --> 02:31:19,560
hats coming soon. Anyway, check them out
if you like go hats coming soon before.

2345
02:31:19,740 --> 02:31:22,880
Yeah. So far I've been impressed
by your turn times on that. Yeah.

2346
02:31:22,881 --> 02:31:26,640
It just depends on what you think soon.
Well would you say soon?

2347
02:31:26,641 --> 02:31:30,900
To me that means to me means three days.
Okay. So I grew up in quiet for hats.

2348
02:31:31,010 --> 02:31:34,060
Don't care. We knew from, no, no,
no. I'm not saying the toy in town.

2349
02:31:34,061 --> 02:31:37,770
I'm not saying that it is, but that's
not what I'm saying right now. Okay.

2350
02:31:37,771 --> 02:31:41,400
So quiet in Oman.
On Coy in Hawaii.

2351
02:31:42,120 --> 02:31:46,410
So on the end of Omal road is a,
I don't know what it is,

2352
02:31:46,740 --> 02:31:51,740
a church or religious center or something
and it says on the top it says Jesus

2353
02:31:51,930 --> 02:31:54,810
coming soon.
And that went up when I was I think

2354
02:31:56,500 --> 02:31:57,580
seven years old.

2355
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:02,260
So soon is a relative term very
relevant or irrelevant relative. Yes.

2356
02:32:02,261 --> 02:32:04,060
It's a sliding scale for sure.

2357
02:32:04,210 --> 02:32:09,210
Let me tell you what hats I hope
get here before the return of Jesus.

2358
02:32:09,310 --> 02:32:13,190
Yes. That's the goal for sure. We can
make that happen if the officer nice.

2359
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:18,640
Alright. Cause he got it summertime.
Yup. Now, right now it's summertime.

2360
02:32:18,730 --> 02:32:22,480
So we need hats to wear in the sun.
All right. To block the sun. Yes.

2361
02:32:22,540 --> 02:32:26,220
That's what had to do. Yeah. Got
You. So yeah, there it is. Jocko,

2362
02:32:26,221 --> 02:32:30,310
store.com if you see something on there
that you like, you recognize the layers.

2363
02:32:31,330 --> 02:32:31,670
Okay.

2364
02:32:31,670 --> 02:32:35,780
Grab something. Support.
Here's a little thing.

2365
02:32:36,410 --> 02:32:37,700
Jocko designed a shirt

2366
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:43,310
design specifically 100%
too. By the way, by Jocko.

2367
02:32:43,311 --> 02:32:47,050
I even tried to put my little
pinky in there and some input. Yes,

2368
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:51,460
straight up denied. I'm like, Bro,
do you know who manages that? Sure.

2369
02:32:51,550 --> 02:32:56,030
Yet it's not up. It's been
printed, but you know,

2370
02:32:56,240 --> 02:33:01,240
we went with it and 100% Jockos
designed 100% not really approved by me.

2371
02:33:03,140 --> 02:33:07,460
I mean it's approved, but like I tried
to like make my little considerations,

2372
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:10,720
my little altered the nations and God

2373
02:33:12,390 --> 02:33:17,240
was watching out for them alterations.
I was worried about my creative input.

2374
02:33:17,510 --> 02:33:21,890
We overcame them. Totally overcame
them. Yeah. Trump. So I said,

2375
02:33:21,891 --> 02:33:26,690
we're making this shirt and that's
a direct order. What happened?

2376
02:33:27,500 --> 02:33:29,840
Now you're w you. Yeah,
you finessed it for sure.

2377
02:33:29,841 --> 02:33:34,150
But at the end of the day I looked up and
I was like, Dang my input on, you know,

2378
02:33:34,160 --> 02:33:38,270
the store that you know, I, I think, I
feel like I'm the manager of the store.

2379
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:41,870
Apparently I'm wrong, but
that's cool. So anyway,

2380
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:46,730
new shirt as a result designed by Jocko
Jocko, star.com. That's a good one.

2381
02:33:46,790 --> 02:33:49,100
Also, psychological warfare, if
you didn't know what that is,

2382
02:33:49,101 --> 02:33:54,050
it's an album with tracks of
Jacqueline's voice saying and telling,

2383
02:33:54,260 --> 02:33:57,220
helping. So what it's
doing, it's helped me.

2384
02:33:57,560 --> 02:34:01,220
No hope so people, myself
included, by the way,

2385
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:05,330
through moments of
weakness if they arrive.

2386
02:34:06,440 --> 02:34:10,130
Arise. All right man.
All right. Yeah. So yeah,

2387
02:34:10,131 --> 02:34:15,050
if you're having trouble or one day,
if you want an alarm clock of me,

2388
02:34:15,650 --> 02:34:19,240
which people ask me for, just
get psychological warfare
instead. It is your alarm.

2389
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:22,960
Yeah, that's it. That's why we meet it
because everyone was asking for that.

2390
02:34:23,050 --> 02:34:25,630
So there you have it. You don't
need to, you don't need it.

2391
02:34:25,631 --> 02:34:28,420
We're not going to make a ring tone,
I don't think. Yeah, we'll take, yeah,

2392
02:34:28,610 --> 02:34:31,500
technically you just said it. You just
said it as a ring tone and your guide,

2393
02:34:32,160 --> 02:34:34,180
it's, yeah, and it works
really good. Especially that,

2394
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:37,360
well it depends on your weakness,
right? Or what kind of person you are.

2395
02:34:37,361 --> 02:34:40,750
So you know me, if you say, Hey Echo,

2396
02:34:40,751 --> 02:34:43,300
wake up at four 30 for
one year every morning,

2397
02:34:43,690 --> 02:34:48,190
one year there's going to be a day or two
where it's going to be harder than you

2398
02:34:48,191 --> 02:34:52,150
know, than another day. So you put it
on the track. What time do you wake up?

2399
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:55,730
That's classified.
So if you have

2400
02:34:59,640 --> 02:35:00,473
a noon,

2401
02:35:03,620 --> 02:35:07,630
I woke up at noon on Saturday cause
you're still on Hawaiian time.

2402
02:35:08,160 --> 02:35:12,460
Did you wake up at noon? How could
you even do that? I didn't mean to,

2403
02:35:13,740 --> 02:35:17,080
it was, it's a long story. But
yes, my wife was like, hey,

2404
02:35:17,081 --> 02:35:20,600
it was good for you to join us or nice,
nice of you to join us.

2405
02:35:21,070 --> 02:35:25,530
Wife is ragging on you for a until
noon credit to her, she was just like,

2406
02:35:25,630 --> 02:35:30,540
she got two kids to take care
of sprawled out queen size bed,

2407
02:35:30,700 --> 02:35:35,500
getting African. Oh God. It's not
going to make a change. Nonetheless,

2408
02:35:35,501 --> 02:35:39,700
back to psychological warfare.
If you have, you know, if
you're on a d cool diet,

2409
02:35:39,790 --> 02:35:44,560
you're eating is clean. Boom. You get that
temptation one day at work, the donuts,

2410
02:35:44,561 --> 02:35:47,980
you don't, they bring the donuts, right?
We talk about these all the time. Yeah.

2411
02:35:47,981 --> 02:35:51,850
People just do that too. Okay. He
don't, Gracie, he run our wire.

2412
02:35:52,500 --> 02:35:53,333
Arlene,

2413
02:35:54,940 --> 02:35:59,860
he talks about um, like how you go to a
restaurant and they're like, oh, so cute.

2414
02:35:59,861 --> 02:36:03,220
The kids. Here's some, you know, here's
a cupcake for the kid's so cute. Right?

2415
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:07,360
And people like overlook how
rude and uh, it's like, uh,

2416
02:36:07,370 --> 02:36:10,300
it's how much of a violation
that is rat poison.

2417
02:36:10,301 --> 02:36:14,050
You can feed them while you're on it. Hey
Look, look how cute your kids, our kids,

2418
02:36:14,140 --> 02:36:19,000
let me give them something super unhealthy
violation.

2419
02:36:19,160 --> 02:36:22,050
Anyway, that's what happens when people
bring donuts for work and thinking, Oh,

2420
02:36:22,051 --> 02:36:26,400
I'm going to do this for the office.
Not that I frown upon that.

2421
02:36:26,401 --> 02:36:28,510
I'm just saying put it into perspective.
Nonetheless.

2422
02:36:28,511 --> 02:36:30,790
If someone does that while you're at work,
boom,

2423
02:36:30,791 --> 02:36:34,570
you got to track where that to just
put it on real quick, but on your buds,

2424
02:36:34,571 --> 02:36:38,440
you know? So it's for you sugarcoated
lies, sugarcoated lies directly into your,

2425
02:36:38,470 --> 02:36:42,310
anyway, it's called psychological warfare.
Look at it on or look for it on iTunes,

2426
02:36:42,530 --> 02:36:45,990
Jocko Willink, Google play, Google play,
Amazon music, all that stuff. Yeah,

2427
02:36:46,010 --> 02:36:46,600
good stuff.

2428
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:51,600
Wherever the MP3S are being
distributed or also on Amazon,

2429
02:36:52,720 --> 02:36:57,340
you can get Jocko white tea. And here's
a little verified purchase review.

2430
02:36:57,370 --> 02:37:00,130
Again, this means that the
person, this is verified,

2431
02:37:00,570 --> 02:37:04,810
it's 100% so here's the review.
As a tea guy, I am somewhat picky,

2432
02:37:05,260 --> 02:37:06,850
so I ordered some Jocko white tea.

2433
02:37:07,060 --> 02:37:09,970
I'm pretty sure the box was
Groundling when I opened it.

2434
02:37:12,730 --> 02:37:16,210
That's a verified review.
I brewed up tea and poured

2435
02:37:16,250 --> 02:37:19,670
it over ice. After which I went
on my bike for a training ride,

2436
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:21,110
I was pulled over twice.

2437
02:37:21,230 --> 02:37:23,990
I explained that I had consumed some
Jocko white tea before I left and the

2438
02:37:23,991 --> 02:37:26,180
officer just nodded and said get after it.

2439
02:37:27,500 --> 02:37:32,390
The next officer was not so forgiving
and gave me a ticket for speeding limit.

2440
02:37:33,710 --> 02:37:34,610
So in summary,

2441
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:38,270
this you can get pretty pricey if you
don't mind speeding tickets while you're

2442
02:37:38,271 --> 02:37:38,721
riding a bike.

2443
02:37:38,721 --> 02:37:43,160
So as just another thing to be careful
of if drink Jocko white tea and then you

2444
02:37:43,161 --> 02:37:43,731
get on a bike,

2445
02:37:43,731 --> 02:37:46,100
you've got to watch out that you don't
get speeding tickets cause you're gonna

2446
02:37:46,101 --> 02:37:50,000
be going a little faster than the speed
limit. That's the Jocko white tea.

2447
02:37:50,330 --> 02:37:55,330
Also on Amazon you can get
way the warrior kid and this,

2448
02:37:55,970 --> 02:37:59,780
this review here of way of the warrior
kid also verified purchase review from

2449
02:37:59,781 --> 02:38:00,614
Amazon.

2450
02:38:01,100 --> 02:38:04,010
This is the book I wish I'd read when
I was a kid and that's the same thing I

2451
02:38:04,011 --> 02:38:04,844
say all the time.

2452
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:08,090
I work in schools and I've already
bought a spare copy to lend out to my

2453
02:38:08,091 --> 02:38:11,570
students.
I've also read it twice myself though.

2454
02:38:11,571 --> 02:38:15,470
I'm 39 year old man.
Side Note,

2455
02:38:15,710 --> 02:38:17,870
my pullups I have also improved.

2456
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:22,250
So I'm telling you it's a kid's book.
Sure. That's what everyone says.

2457
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:24,830
That's you know what it's set up.

2458
02:38:24,860 --> 02:38:28,280
Kind of looks like there's some lessons
in there from uncle Jake that we all

2459
02:38:28,281 --> 02:38:33,080
need so way of the warrior kid.
You can pick that one up. Also,

2460
02:38:33,140 --> 02:38:38,030
discipline equals freedom field manual.
Do you know what this book is about?

2461
02:38:39,050 --> 02:38:43,910
It's about getting after it mentally
and physically simple, straight forward.

2462
02:38:44,300 --> 02:38:47,300
So if you want to get after it,

2463
02:38:48,980 --> 02:38:51,830
get the discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2464
02:38:53,750 --> 02:38:56,720
Not a lot of fluff in there.
I'm going to tell you that right now.

2465
02:38:56,960 --> 02:38:59,360
Not a lot of fluff.
Straight forward.

2466
02:39:01,050 --> 02:39:05,040
Of course we got the book.
Extreme ownership is the book.

2467

2509
02:42:10,610 --> 02:42:14,000
on July 1st,
1916

2510
02:42:15,500 --> 02:42:19,730
before he went over the
top into the raging hell,

2511
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:23,630
that was the battle of the Somme.
He said,

2512
02:42:24,710 --> 02:42:26,330
it is a glorious morning,

2513
02:42:30,670 --> 02:42:31,890
and it certainly is.

2514
02:42:34,970 --> 02:42:35,960
All of them are.
