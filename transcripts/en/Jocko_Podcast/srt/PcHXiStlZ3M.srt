1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,220
This is Jocko podcast number
one 66 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,560
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,620
Good evening and we are rolling straight
into part three podcast number three of

4
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:17,670
the psychology for the fighting man.

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,080
What you should know
about yourself and others.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,260
So if you haven't listened
to the previous two podcasts,

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,030
there are about the same book and there's
so much information that we split it

8
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:35,430
up because it was going long.
And this part,

9
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:39,450
these couple of sections here are really
what I was originally going to cover,

10
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:41,760
but then I figured I'd cover it all.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,820
And next thing you know this turned
into three podcasts series tool and

12
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,600
this section is called the
soldier's personal adjustment.

13
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,050
And here we go back to the book.
In a demo in a democratic civilian army,

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:05,070
millions of men are suddenly abruptly
thrown into a new way of life.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,740
It is in many ways a tough life.
Men used to going their own ways,

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,180
choosing their own jobs,

17
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:17,181
associates neckties times for going to
bed now have to follow military orders

18
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:22,401
about all these things men accustomed
to a comfortable litter of belongings

19
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:27,900
around them. Find the bear neatness of
police barracks, hard to get used to.

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,530
Those used to steam heat,

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,040
warm shower baths and breakfast.

22
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:40,041
Eggs cooked just three and a half minutes
at home may be pretty uncomfortable

23
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,640
when they have to put up with a bed on
the ground and cold water for shaves.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,960
There is moreover no privacy in the army.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,980
If a man over sleeps and is
corporal dumps him out of his bunk,

26
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,930
the whole company knows about it.
If he looks at his girls photograph a lot,

27
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,990
they know that to the business of living
in a goldfish bowl and having to take

28
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,310
razzing of from his fellow soldiers is
about the hardest thing for a sensitive

29
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:12,000
recruit to get used to.
That's a fact. So here we go.

30
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,270
These are all just welcome to
the military. You're going to,

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,400
you're not going to get to
eat what you want to eat.

32
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,160
You're not going to get to
sleep when you want to sleep.

33
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,350
You're not going to get to
keep what you want to keep.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,610
Think about those a personal freedoms and
everybody cherishes. They're all gone.

35
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,920
Even your privacy when you get to,
when I went to Navy boot camp,

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,310
you go in the bathrooms, there's
just stalls. There's no, I'm sorry.

37
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,690
There's just toilets.
There's no stalls.

38
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,920
You just sit down next to everyone else
and do your business through privacy is

39
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,760
gone.
Yeah.

40
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,930
Not every man of course meets hardships
for the first time when he goes to the

41
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:51,660
army. Some of known hunger
and cold and hard work,

42
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,980
some never saw flushed toilet or a
shower bath before they got to camp.

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,380
Some never had a good square meal.
Well cooked for them.

44
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,140
The army is providing luxuries.
That's true too.

45
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,620
Not Probably.

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,620
It's definitely not as true
now as it was in 1942 yeah,

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,540
because in 1942 some people were still
living out in the Bush here in America

48
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,570
and there's a lot less people still
living in the bush and America now.

49
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,160
They're still out there though,
but farmer lawyer, banker section,

50
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:23,680
hand college man or man
of little schooling,

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,740
they all must adjust themselves
to an entirely new way of living.

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,300
All must learn new habits.

53
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:32,500
Young men may find it easier to make the
adjustment than older men because they

54
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:36,370
are ordinarily a little more flexible
with habits. A little less fixed.

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,600
That's for sure.

56
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,830
If you think you're going to
join the military at some point,

57
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,270
join when you're as young as possible.
No attachments and I was so

58
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,610
okay.

59
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,660
Just dumb, I guess for lack of a better
word, I just didn't care about anything.

60
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:56,390
When I came in were like, uh,
we're going to shave your head.

61
00:03:56,391 --> 00:03:58,780
We're going to take all your civilian
stuff. I'm like, whatever, take it away.

62
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,614
I don't care.

63
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,560
But most men can fit themselves into
the new life and work without too much

64
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:07,120
friction.
Those who do not,

65
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,150
those who do it most easily are the
ones who accept the new life at wants.

66
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,120
Throw off civilian habits with
civilian clothes and put themselves

67
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,800
wholeheartedly into becoming soldiers.

68
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,010
One of the hardest adjustments come
with a loss of contact with family and

69
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:18,371
friends.

70
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:23,230
The soldier who misses friends at home
is slow about making new friends at camp.

71
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,570
Okay,

72
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,280
so there you go. If you are homesick,
what you should do is make new friends.

73
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,530
The army is liberal with furloughs as
war permits from such homesick men when

74
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:35,790
they first go into the service,

75
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,920
but the real remedy is not in hurry trips
home or long distance telephone calls.

76
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,430
It is in building up of new interests
and new ties in and around the camp.

77
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,950
Yeah. When I left home, I left home,

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,790
I was gone and just that was that.

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,130
One of the fears that many men have to
overcome or adjust to when they first go

80
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:05,770
into the army is the feeling that
they may lose their identity,

81
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:10,090
their freedom of individual expression
from revel, Lita taps. There is little,

82
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,450
if any opportunity for the new recruit
to do anything he's not told to do

83
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,570
whether he wants to or not.
He must get up at the sound of the Bugle,

84
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,500
put on the prescribed uniform march when
he has commanded stand at attention,

85
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,920
when he has ordered and do so even
when with a mosquito biting him.

86
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,520
No longer does he eat when he's hungry
or go to sleep when he is tired.

87
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,040
All conduct seems to
be according to order.

88
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,200
Is this really a fight for freedom
and democracy? Of course it is,

89
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,320
but conformity and discipline
are necessary for the
efficient operation of an

90
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:42,220
army.
And I will say this,

91
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,690
it's only that strict during boot camp.

92
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:51,250
I mean for the most part during boot camp,
that's when you really are,

93
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,690
every movement that you make is based
on what you're being told to do once you

94
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:59,690
get into the fleet or out into the,
uh, into a battalion somewhere.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,710
It's definitely, it's not easier, but
you do have more individual freedom.

96
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,690
So you,

97
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,520
some people want to talk to a
kid that's 16 and they are west.

98
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,320
They're worried about,
well you know,

99
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:17,321
I really like to whatever I like to surf
and I don't want to give up surfing.

100
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,440
You'll have time to surf if you're
stationed somewhere, you know,

101
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,150
joined the coast guard cause they're
always stationed near the water. You know,

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,073
there's an idea.

103
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,430
Next a soldiers worries.

104
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,550
There is first the fear of death.

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,560
It is best met by accepting
the possibility of death
as a natural part of the

106
00:06:36,561 --> 00:06:40,610
job. And by being careful not to
lose a sense of proportion about it.

107
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,021
Again,

108
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,470
it's weird for me to read this book cause
that's if you had asked me that before

109
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,140
I read this book and that's what I would
have told you you have to do is be like,

110
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:51,890
yeah, there's a chance I'm going to
die and if you're scared of that,

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,480
you should try and get over it.

112
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,990
And I think the sense of proportion
that's saying like, listen, okay,

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,180
the world's not going to end if I die.

114
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,390
No soldier is so important that he
isn't justified in thinking the enemy is

115
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,520
aiming every, oh, that's
what they're talking about.

116
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:14,270
This is that the sense of proportion is
no soldiers and so important that he's

117
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:18,290
justified in thinking that the enemy is
aiming every bullet bomb and shell at

118
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:18,950
him.

119
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,390
Besides there are great many men in the
army and only a small proportion get hit

120
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:28,391
in battle and the greater part of those
who get hit will live and get well

121
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:32,240
earned relief from the strain of combat.
After that,

122
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,610
there may be a purple heart
decoration and some glory.

123
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,010
This is when we're starting to lean
a little bit towards propaganda.

124
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,640
They were like, listen, you're probably
not going to die. Which that is true.

125
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,211
And the,

126
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:47,030
the amount of people that are in the
military can be compared to the amount of

127
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,330
people that go into combat compared to
the people that actually make contact

128
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,100
with the enemy compared to the
people that actually get hit.

129
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,290
It's a very small percentage
and if you do get hit,

130
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,780
guess what? You got some glory and
a purple heart coming your way.

131
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,860
Don't worry about it. Yeah, like I said,

132
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:08,630
this sometimes is leaning a little bit
towards propaganda in a positive and

133
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,730
truthful way,
but you got to,

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,250
you got to take it with a grain of salt.
As they say back to the book,

135
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:21,170
and soldiers who have been through the
worst of warfare are inclined to say that

136
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,540
only a fool wants to live forever.

137
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,370
They usually add the warning,
but if you must die,

138
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,050
make your death count for something.

139
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,250
Don't throw your life away
by taking needless chances.

140
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,190
So that's the old again, uh, some,

141
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:44,540
some propaganda for you there. Hey listen
man. Only a fool wants to live forever.

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,340
Let's go get some, and like I
said, there is some truth to that.

143
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,060
Back to the book.

144
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,900
Sensitive men may also worry or feel
guilty over killing enemy soldiers,

145
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,690
other men in action,
unless they understand this,

146
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:05,340
worry in face it squarely they may head
into trouble because killing is the main

147
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,080
job of a combat soldier,

148
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,243
okay?

149
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,940
This is something people tend
to forget from time to time,

150
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,540
okay?

151
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,120
The job of a soldier is to kill people,

152
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,480
okay?

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,110
From the earliest childhood,
American boys are taught that it is wrong.

154
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,370
The greatest wrong to kill.

155
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:26,330
This principle is learned so early that
it becomes part of them. As boys grow up,

156
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:29,870
they forget most of what happened
in infancy and early childhood.

157
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,250
Few people in fact can remember much of
what happened in their first three years.

158
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,960
Yet they retained within themselves.

159
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:38,990
The attitudes formed during
the their earliest years.

160
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,760
They don't remember ever learning them.
It seems as if they always felt that way.

161
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,420
If a man did not learn that it was
wrong to kill until he was grown,

162
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,810
he would learn it then with it,
with his mind,

163
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,140
and he would be easy to lay aside that
rule when war or emergency makes it

164
00:09:57,501 --> 00:09:59,390
necessary for him to kill.

165
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,270
Okay.

166
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:05,800
But the don'ts learned in
earliest childhood become
the voice of the conscience

167
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,330
in the adult. They seem to be
absorbed rather than learned.

168
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,610
And even though his mind tells a grown
man that the execution of criminals is

169
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:20,380
justified, his emotions may rebel.
Then if duty forces him to kill,

170
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,650
he may go ahead and do it,
but afterwards he'll feel a vague,

171
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,700
uneasiness and anxiety.
His conscience won't rest.

172
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,750
Some men strictly brought up, may even
get sick at the sick, at the stomach,

173
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:35,230
at the site of a limp, pathetic
body of a rabbit that has been shot.

174
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,090
The Cure for the exam anxiety that
results from this kind of conflict between

175
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,550
conscience and reason is to understand it.

176
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:47,620
Once a man realizes that the feeling is
natural in men brought up as an average

177
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:50,440
American to respect human life,

178
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,860
this particular worry
won't haunt him so much.

179
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,240
He may have a few bad dreams, but that
won't interfere with doing the job ahead.

180
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,360
Disagreeable though it may be.
Again,

181
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:06,390
this is one where we're trying
to let people know that,

182
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:08,890
hey,
what you feel when you feel all like,

183
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:12,400
I don't feel like I want to go kill
people. That's okay, we get it.

184
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,080
Here's why you feel that way.

185
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:16,300
You feel that way because you've been
told that since you were a little kid,

186
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,720
but you have to bring your reason into
the problem and logically calculate that

187
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,470
it's okay to kill people.

188
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,920
Tough. This is, this is,

189
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,950
this is trying to tell a generation of
American kids that they're going to go

190
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:38,610
and fight and kill the enemy.
That's what this is doing.

191
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,160
Okay?

192
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,720
And even letting them know like, listen,
you may have a few bad dreams, right?

193
00:11:44,721 --> 00:11:49,420
And that is probably one of the most
minor ways of explaining the fact that you

194
00:11:49,421 --> 00:11:53,510
are going to have freaking
nightmares, cold sweats. And they're,

195
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,330
they're downplaying that,

196
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,520
but they're letting them know that
that's what's going to happen.

197
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,490
So this is,

198
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,730
this is definitely a book
called the psychology
psychology for the fighting man,

199
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,540
and they're trying to use some psychology
here to get the guys in the right

200
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:16,740
mindset where they can kill

201
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,340
next to the healthy
mind to be at his best.

202
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,010
A soldier must keep his mind
fit as well as his body.

203
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,140
He must be mentally alert and
accurately aware of his surroundings.

204
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:33,060
He must shoulder responsibility willingly

205
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,560
and except the dictates of superior
officers without resentment.

206
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,130
That's interesting. They used the
word resentment, not without question,

207
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,450
but without resentment.

208
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,970
He must be able to get along with other
men without undue friction and with

209
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,050
mutual pleasure. That's
important. Undue friction.

210
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,510
There's going to be friction.
You're working with other human beings.

211
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:58,770
All other human beings are crazy.

212
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,520
The marks of a man with healthy mind or
personality are, and that's one thing.

213
00:13:05,521 --> 00:13:08,250
This book continues to do well
as it makes these little lists.

214
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,960
So here's the marks of a man with
a healthy mind or personality. One,

215
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:16,890
he uses his abilities with
enthusiasm and satisfaction,

216
00:13:16,891 --> 00:13:21,890
although not always with happiness
or full contentment. Okay, so, Eh,

217
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:23,370
you know,
I might not be totally into this,

218
00:13:23,371 --> 00:13:27,270
but I'm going to get it done
the best possible way to,

219
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:33,180
he wants to do something worthwhile
to pull his load and not be carried by

220
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,014
others.

221
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,050
It's interesting how a lot of this stuff
is in full alignment with some Jordan

222
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,250
Peterson activities. Someone's
Jordan Peterson statements, right?

223
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,250
Shoulder responsibility willingly.
I think that's a,

224
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,160
I think maybe Jordan read this book.

225
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,980
It is a psychology book and he says
maybe he read this book and started

226
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:56,400
snatching good material from it.
We're on to you JP.

227
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:03,000
Uh, but yeah, and even this thing,
man wants to do something worthwhile.

228
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,940
Jordan Peterson talks
about that all the time.

229
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,860
He gets along with other persons including
his superiors and those with whom he

230
00:14:10,861 --> 00:14:14,760
has a difference of opinion.
Very important.

231
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,830
How often is it we see people that
I don't agree with your opinion,

232
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,850
therefore I don't like you and I
can't get along with you. So lame,

233
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,350
so lame.

234
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,640
I actually welcome people that have
differing opinions than me because maybe

235
00:14:29,641 --> 00:14:30,600
they can teach me something.

236
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,630
Maybe I can learn something from their
viewpoint for when he is disappointed or

237
00:14:36,961 --> 00:14:39,000
meets with deprivation or strain.

238
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,500
He faces the situation with constructive
ideas and a fighting spirit,

239
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,660
not with fear, rage,
hopelessness or suspicion.

240
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,160
So then he does not

241
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,670
suffer from in debt,
indigestion, headache or pain,

242
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:58,280
which though not all at all,

243
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,820
voluntary may be produced
by mental troubles.

244
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,260
So that's how you meet like
problems with a good attitude,

245
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,050
not with fear,
rage and hopelessness.

246
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,600
Five he perseveres in the effort to solve
a problem or complete a task in spite

247
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:21,810
of the difficulty and disappointment.
Check perseverance.

248
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,010
Six he likes to give as well as take

249
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,693
check.

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,140
You ever known those kinds of people
that when they say that they can give but

251
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,230
they can't take? Yes. Yeah. Those
people are fun to hang around.

252
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,350
They never recognize it either. Yeah.
And then if you call someone on it,

253
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:45,410
like of course it's a denial,
denial, denial in a defensive way,

254
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:49,180
which is exactly what you're
talking about cause you, you,

255
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,170
you are proving my point right now.

256
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,310
Continuing on some break down mentally
because they are just not fitted for army

257
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:01,370
life. They never should have
been inducted in the first place.

258
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,030
Physicians at Induction Centers Watch
carefully for the signs of beginning

259
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,740
mental illness.
But nevertheless,

260
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,150
some slip by and actually go through a
pretty good chunk explaining that just

261
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:14,090
you're not gonna catch every person,
that

262
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,880
that has a possibility of having some
kind of a mental illness of some of them

263
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,560
are going to end up and you've
got to be ready to deal with them.

264
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,570
And those are the people that he,

265
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,420
they say or four doomed to
develop a mental illness.

266
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,160
But then there's people beyond them.
And here we go.

267
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,260
In addition to those men who seem for
doomed to develop a mental illness,

268
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,670
there are other men who break in
the army under battle conditions.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
These are real battle casualties just
as much as if they had lost a leg.

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,780
So this is interesting because we hear
all these people talking about PTSD and

271
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,290
whatnot as if it's new and
as if it was unrecognized.

272
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,440
This book is written in 1942
and they're saying, hey,

273
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,640
somebody that suffers that kind of
a stress under battle conditions.

274
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,490
That's a casualty.
Just like losing the leg.

275
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,760
So there you go.
Yeah,

276
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,850
and that's the part that's
kind of well themes anyway,

277
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:14,060
new is that it's just as traumatic as
the physical damage and like you said,

278
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:20,040
it seems new, right? It seems
new, but this is World War II

279
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,810
and we just don't, we always have to learn
the same lessons over and over again.

280
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:25,680
Why is that?

281
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,690
Why do we have to learn the same
lessons over and over and over again?

282
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,990
It's a horrible reality.
Back to the book.

283
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:37,590
A man in battle may receive a blow on
the head that will cause injury to the

284
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,210
brain that is serious,

285
00:17:39,211 --> 00:17:42,120
particularly if he is a leader responsible
for the direction and safety of his

286
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:44,700
men.
This is an interesting point.

287
00:17:44,701 --> 00:17:47,570
Since the brain itself
has no sense organs,

288
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:52,020
a man does not feel when his brain is
injured and may think he is not been badly

289
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:54,990
hurt.
This is how we end up with guys with Tbi,

290
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,110
with traumatic brain injuries cause they
don't, your brain gets rocked around,

291
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,920
but it doesn't, it's not like a bruise.
It's not, it's not aching. I mean,

292
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:04,960
he'd get a little bit of a headache once
you want you to experience a big boss

293
00:18:04,961 --> 00:18:07,080
like the next day,
and I wonder why I got a little headache.

294
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,370
There's a reason for that,

295
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,590
but even what seems like a slight
wound in the head must be looked after

296
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:16,770
carefully. Usually the wounded
man should be relieved from duty.

297
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,400
If even a small part of his brain is
hurt or his head is received a hard blow,

298
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:23,400
which does not even crack the skull,
nevertheless,

299
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,910
he's likely to be confused or to
act in a peculiar way in battle.

300
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,720
So I think it's funny,
it looked,

301
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:33,060
you got to blow that didn't even crack
your skull. They're like, that's their,

302
00:18:33,061 --> 00:18:35,370
that's their assessment.
It's, it can't be that bad.

303
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,480
It didn't even crack your skull.

304
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,020
A even a guy that didn't crack his skull
needs to get checked out and needs a

305
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:42,960
little break
back to the book.

306
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,990
A direct blow on the head is not the
only way a man's brain can be injured.

307
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,700
The blast of a shell nearby can cause harm
to the brain. Modern helmets, however,

308
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:58,500
protect the soldiers that years in his
brain very well. That's kind of rubbish.

309
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:00,780
The uh,

310
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,840
how the helmet protects your ears and
our helmets obviously or even more modern

311
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:08,880
than the World War II.
Uh,

312
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,630
steel helmet that there were at
least ours are made of Kevlar. No,

313
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,610
that's not going to protect your ears.

314
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,000
What we do have the protectors
know is we were a lot of,

315
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,460
a lot of people wear headphones for
your radio and they have noise canceling

316
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:27,810
headphones so that that does protect your
ears. Is it the kind that like go over,

317
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,070
you go over your ears and then there
are ones that go inside your ears too

318
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,500
depending on what you like.
But yeah,

319
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:38,680
most of most people are wearing noise
cancelling headphones that go over both of

320
00:19:38,681 --> 00:19:42,870
yours and they pick up noise
from the outside and they,

321
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,580
they uh, mute down. Yeah,
really loud noises. Now

322
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,870
one thing that's key,
when you're wearing a headphones,

323
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,830
those headphones on both ears,
you lose.

324
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,290
There's something that you lose.
There's a couple of things that you lose.

325
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,180
You lose the ability to tell distance
how far away something is and where it's

326
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:06,060
coming from and you lose the ability
to tell where it's coming from.

327
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,260
So if you see pictures of
like me of life of Stoner,

328
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,980
most of the time we have one
year on in one ear off and,

329
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,940
and sometimes people would ask,
people see a picture of like,

330
00:20:17,941 --> 00:20:18,990
what don't you have your headphones on,

331
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,380
here's why you want to be able to hear
direction that someone's yelling for you

332
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,700
and you want to be able to tell somewhat
what the distances and those things are

333
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:33,090
just gone. Then you have the
noise canceling headphones on,

334
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,260
noise canceling, kind of go in your ears.
There's donuts. There are interesting.

335
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,440
Yeah. The ones, the ones that I
have for shooting do that, you know,

336
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:43,980
it has a little volume thing
and, and also I don't, obviously,

337
00:20:43,981 --> 00:20:48,970
I don't know exactly how they made
them to work, but the, it's like one,

338
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:51,400
a gunshot goes off,
it actually mutes everything.

339
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:53,470
So if I'm talking to you and you know,

340
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:57,640
a gunshot goes off like that for that
instant use, you go off to, you know,

341
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,600
yeah. And the deal, it is true. You
don't know where it's coming from.

342
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,670
So he could be over here literally on
the opposite side. You know, it's crazy.

343
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:07,451
Yeah.

344
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:12,451
So for guys that are in the military or
in some kind of law enforcement where

345
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:16,030
you're, where you're wearing
those headsets, just be advised.

346
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,350
And I wouldn't go to the point where
I'd cut that other headphone off.

347
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,530
I would keep it, I just push it behind
my ear and wear it that way all the time.

348
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:26,170
And that way if I needed to,

349
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,170
I could put both headphones
on because you can also run,

350
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:32,920
and this is another thing
that's a challenge in a
leadership position as you can

351
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:37,390
run two different radio
frequencies, one into each ear. Uh,

352
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,010
and so when that's going on,

353
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:42,430
then you've got two voices coming in at
the same time talking about different

354
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,680
things. And it takes a little bit
of practice to get used to that.

355
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,970
And actually it's something that they say
women are better at than men. Yes sir.

356
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,100
They ran a test. Have
you read that? Yes. Yeah.

357
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,740
I read some research about it,

358
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:57,310
but women can listen to two conversations
easier than men can listen to two

359
00:21:57,311 --> 00:22:01,690
conversations. But can they draw a bicycle
while we've been through this before?

360
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,190
It's risky.
That's a risky conversation.

361
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,050
The same study that or it wasn't the
same study? It was a presentation.

362
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,640
It was like a video with the article.

363
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,970
It was the same one that said about the
drawing the bike thing as the carry on

364
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:16,900
tooth conversations or
multitask in certain ways where
it requires concentration.

365
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:19,510
All this stuff. Yes they are.
Yeah. That's interesting.

366
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,760
That's why like my wife can literally
be on the phone and like watch a TV show

367
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:27,430
that you have to follow.
You don't like do that kind of stuff.

368
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:31,120
And I'm like the hot breath,
you can't watch this show.

369
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,410
You can be like shopping for
curtains at the same time.

370
00:22:35,411 --> 00:22:36,970
You know like there
were watching the show,

371
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:40,330
are we shopping for Kirk dance kind
of thing. But they can do that.

372
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,570
The so they have a little
advanced skill there.

373
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,370
So the modern helmets,
they don't practice.

374
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:51,670
They don't protect your head from shell
blast at all. Even our helmets today,

375
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:56,050
they don't. Going back to
the book, besides these
direct injuries to the brain,

376
00:22:56,051 --> 00:22:59,470
men in battle can suffer
shocks to the mind every month.

377
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,920
Every man has his limit
mentally as well as physically.

378
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,230
There are strains which no man,

379
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,800
however tough minded minded Ken ender,

380
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,220
modern battle has pushed closer and
closer to these final limits of man's

381
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:19,360
endurance, grueling
hardships, great fatigue,

382
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:23,350
prolonged loss of sleep,
blistering heat, intense cold,

383
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
high altitudes,
great pressures below the sea.

384
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:31,420
These are all conditions that put a
dangerous strain on the mind as well as

385
00:23:31,421 --> 00:23:32,254
body.

386
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:38,160
When a man goes through these things and
then in addition suffered the strain of

387
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:43,030
seeing his friends killed, of being
in constant peril of his own life,

388
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,470
of dealing out death with his own hands.

389
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,680
There may come a time when the
strongest man's mind will sicken

390
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,560
such a sufferer from war
shock is not a weakling.

391
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,010
He is not a coward.
He is a battle casualty.

392
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,280
If given psychiatric first aid promptly,

393
00:24:05,281 --> 00:24:10,020
he will probably recover to take his
place again in the battle unit if

394
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,580
neglected,
however,

395
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,330
he may become permanently ill or may
even seek relief of his mental wounds in

396
00:24:18,091 --> 00:24:22,680
death.
So again,

397
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:27,681
this is 1942 and we still hear
information about this nowadays.

398
00:24:28,381 --> 00:24:33,360
Like it's a revelation and it's not.
And you know,

399
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,350
people trying to seek relief
by committing suicide.

400
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,370
That's what they're saying here.
Seek relief from mental wounds in death.

401
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,150
What does that,
that suicide and also,

402
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,770
and I think to me it's always
dick winters that always, uh,

403
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,680
I always get reminded that he's
the guy that would say, look,

404
00:24:52,681 --> 00:24:54,150
if you've got a guy that's getting close,

405
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,750
you pull them off the battle line and
you let them recover and he'll be fine.

406
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
If you don't pull them off the
battle line, he's gonna break.

407
00:25:00,481 --> 00:25:03,660
He's going to be no good. The red,
it's the engine, it's the engine,

408
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,440
the car engine running in the red.
The car engine is running in the red.

409
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,230
You need to get it to a service
station and get that thing serviced,

410
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,660
give it a little breather.
And then it'll be fine.

411
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:15,330
If you get an engine running in
the red and you keep running it,

412
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:17,070
guess what's going to happen?
You're gonna blow off the engine,

413
00:25:17,071 --> 00:25:18,540
it's going to be done.
It's going to be ruined.

414
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,380
Yeah. So it's kind of like when
you kind of go down that path,

415
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,430
when you think about it, you know, people
who commit suicide just in general,

416
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,540
you know, it kind of is like
kind of got to think about that.

417
00:25:30,541 --> 00:25:35,541
Like they were probably in one way or
another injured right in their brain,

418
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:39,330
whether it be, you know, for one,
you know, by one way or another.

419
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,320
I think you just, you can't
just, when you say injured,

420
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,230
we're not just talking
about physical injury,

421
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,810
we're talking about whatever stress,

422
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,310
massive amount of stress deaf all
seeing all this May, I'm in chaos.

423
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,700
Yes. So yeah, they have seen,

424
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,350
you got to assume that someone that gets
there in these cases has seen something

425
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:04,640
that's so bad or suffered
through something that's so
bad that they seek relief

426
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,480
from these mental stresses in death.

427
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,330
Yeah. So even like a, like a
nonmilitary person where you know,

428
00:26:12,331 --> 00:26:15,690
like it's common for people to be
like, oh, he took the easy way out,

429
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,470
the coward kind of thing, right.
He committed suicide kind of thing.

430
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,860
But if you do really hundred
percent regarded as an injury,

431
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,420
just like your arm or your leg or
something like that, it's kind of like it,

432
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,910
it seems like a little bit
more understandable almost

433
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,850
rather than calling them
a coward outright. Yeah.

434
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm, I'm not, I'm not sure
about that. I think that,

435
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,670
I think that the most important thing
is to recognize that if someone hurts

436
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:54,060
their arm and they keep going on it,
their arm is not going to get better.

437
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,970
Right. If someone breaks their
leg and they keep running on it,

438
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,780
their leg is not going to get better.
And if someone's got a,

439
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,550
got some massive amount of stress
that causes a mental injury,

440
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:10,110
physical, mental injury or mental
psychological, mental injury,

441
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,280
either one of those.

442
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,420
If they don't take a break and
get some help and get some relief,

443
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,090
then it's going to not work. It's
going to break completely. Yeah.

444
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,480
And then they get to a point where this
is what we talk about when we talk about

445
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,760
being in a cloud and
everywhere you look around,

446
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,240
there's nothing but cloud and you think
you're stuck in this storm and there's

447
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:33,080
no way out. That's where
you end up. And you know, I,

448
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I think Peter Tia posted an article about
a young woman who killed herself and I

449
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:43,470
wrote something in
response on social media,

450
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,653
something like,

451
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,480
okay,

452
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,240
that's horrible to see.
Especially I think,

453
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:52,460
I think I wrote something along the
lines of, hey, that's horrible to see,

454
00:27:52,461 --> 00:27:55,130
especially with so many people that
are fighting to live. You know,

455
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,900
you think about people that
have cancer or whatever.

456
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,500
And someone wrote back to me,

457
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,940
okay,

458
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,350
you don't understand mental illness. You
know, you don't understand depression.

459
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,370
And like, I responded back and I said,
and then he kind of said, you know,

460
00:28:12,371 --> 00:28:16,150
it's not like that. And I
said, you're right. I don't,
like, I don't under, I don't,

461
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm not a psychologist.

462
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:19,990
I don't fully understand what
it's like to have this going on.

463
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,730
And it's the same thing when we,

464
00:28:21,731 --> 00:28:26,731
Chris Cornell from Soundgarden killed
himself and I happened to be on Joe

465
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:31,900
Rogan's podcast the next day
and we started off the podcast.

466
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:33,340
We were talking about it.
And you know,

467
00:28:33,341 --> 00:28:36,430
it's the same thing because
what Joe Rogan and I are saying,

468
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,650
and we're not psychologists, we're saying
it's got to be hard to dig out of that,

469
00:28:41,651 --> 00:28:44,950
you know, go, go swing a kettle
bell, go do something active,

470
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,360
which to somebody that's
got massive depression that
just sounds idiotic, but to,

471
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,470
to Joe Rogan and I really get a lot of
satisfaction out of swinging kettle bells

472
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:57,130
and doing Jujitsu. It's like, that
sounds like a decent idea. Right?

473
00:28:57,131 --> 00:29:01,840
It sounds like relief. Yeah. And so, Hey,
I, that's, you know, of course you, yeah,

474
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:06,160
I should I caveat that statement
with, hey man, I'm not a psychologist.

475
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,250
I don't really know when I'd feel like I,

476
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,370
when I feel like there's
darkness in the world,

477
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,290
I really liked to do something physical.
Tim Ferriss said the same thing.

478
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:21,040
Get out of your mind, get into your
body like the, okay, so the, the,

479
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:23,410
you have those conversations.
And you think,

480
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,870
this is what I think, I can't
change what I think, you know,

481
00:29:28,871 --> 00:29:31,300
why this is what I think someone could
change my mind if someone could educate

482
00:29:31,301 --> 00:29:35,950
me. Sure. But I'm just making a statement.
Hey man, that's horrible to see.

483
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,050
Yeah.
It's horrible to see.

484
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,320
Especially when there's people that have
cancer or whatever and they're fighting

485
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:47,500
as hard as they can to stay alive and
someone else that doesn't have any

486
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:51,010
diseases decides, you know what,
I'm going to take my own life.

487
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,880
I'm going to kill myself. That's horrible
to see that. That's my statement. Yeah.

488
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,840
And someone you don't understand
this. And I'm like, no, I don't.

489
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,230
That's part of my point is no,
I don't understand this.

490
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,610
And so I,
I will say this,

491
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:11,430
I've seen how fragile the mind can be.
Yeah.

492
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:14,590
And really why should,
I should rephrase that.

493
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,480
How fragile the mind is because I've
seen people that seem to be going down a

494
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:21,720
good path in,

495
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,620
in all of a sudden out of nowhere
that path is, they're gone. And,

496
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,010
and that's like shocking.
So one thing I guess I,

497
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,020
the part that I understand is that I don't
understand it and it's hard for me to

498
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,900
relate to that and it's hard for
me to understand and say, wow,

499
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,520
I could have seen that common.
No,

500
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:42,340
actually I couldn't seem
that common at all at all.

501
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,680
So the interest,

502
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,270
the most interesting thing about this
to me is this book is from 1942 and it's

503
00:30:51,271 --> 00:30:55,230
talking about the same things that were
apparently still discovering right now

504
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,760
like that sometimes you need a break
from combat like that when you come home

505
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,400
you might be a little bit,
you might have some nightmares

506
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,670
like that.
If you break mentally,

507
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:11,130
it doesn't mean that you're a weak link.

508
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,550
And Band of brothers
does a great job of that.

509
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,330
The one character who's a total bad
ass through and all of a sudden he just

510
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:20,850
can't take anymore. And
they go, okay, no problem.

511
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,670
And Dick winters talks
about it and he says, yeah,

512
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,990
we no one lost any respect for that guy.
The guy took his risks,

513
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:30,210
he did a great job,
and then he couldn't do it anymore.

514
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,350
And David Hackworth describes it as,
hey,

515
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:38,760
you people have a cop and the cop
gets filled up and we'd filled up.

516
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,440
It's filled up.
You can't put any more in there.

517
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:42,450
He can't put any more combat in there.
And it's not,

518
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:45,300
some people have a bigger cup than other
people. It's no disrespect. It's not,

519
00:31:45,301 --> 00:31:48,090
it's not a negative statement,
it's just that's the way it is.

520
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:54,440
So if someone gets in
these bad situations,

521
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,180
what in my opinion you
have to do is take a break,

522
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:01,760
get someone to help get
someone to talk to about it,

523
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,610
that can help you find
your way out of the store.

524
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,170
But that's what I realized from,
from the times we've had.

525
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,520
Speaking of of Jordan Peterson,
the Times that we,

526
00:32:08,521 --> 00:32:09,920
for the first time we had him on here,

527
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,700
I had never really spent any time
thinking about psychology as an actual

528
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,300
possible thing in the world.
You know what I mean?

529
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:22,030
Just kind of seemed like Voodoo
to me. Right. It's, yeah. Yeah.

530
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,160
And then when he was talking through
some of the psychological protocols that

531
00:32:27,801 --> 00:32:32,390
they use to come over particular to
overcome particular psychological issues,

532
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,250
I was like, oh, okay. So this
basically is like a car mechanic,

533
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,180
right? You come in with and you've
got this problem with your car, cool.

534
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,240
This is what we're gonna do to
fix that problem with your car.

535
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,770
And so there's a certain amount of
psychology that was revealed to me from

536
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,700
Jordan as like, oh yeah, this
is when you have this situation,

537
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,440
this is what you do to heal it. And so
it's important. I, that was kind of a,

538
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,440
that was, uh, that was a revelation to me.

539
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,760
Not like a revelation that changed
my world, but it was, for me,

540
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,420
psychology was just always kind of Voodoo.
That's what it seemed like to me.

541
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:12,130
Looking at it from the outside. And I'm
an ignorant person, right? Seriously,

542
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,500
I'm an, I'm kind of an ignorant
person. I, I graduated high school,

543
00:33:15,501 --> 00:33:17,120
I grew up in the middle,
a, grew up in the military.

544
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,840
I spent all my time around a bunch
of other knuckleheads like me.

545
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:22,970
It's like you're,

546
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,120
you're not talking this vast with this
vast experience of all these different

547
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:30,560
data points of the world. It's like, no,

548
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:34,970
I'm just a guy who never really dealt
with psychology before. So for me,

549
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,400
I just looked at, oh, it's just
some weird people laying on a couch.

550
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:42,050
You know what I learned from the movies?
And so I didn't see the benefit of,

551
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,820
Hey, oh, they actually have
identifiable problems that they can see.

552
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,100
And then they have
protocols to overcome those.

553
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,460
So if someone is out there and
they're caught in this storm,

554
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,510
whatever that storm may be,

555
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,930
if you go to one of these brain mechanics,

556
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,380
if they would've called it brain mechanic,
I would have understood it.

557
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,940
Go to a brain mechanical,

558
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,670
they're called a psychologist to
a brain mechanic and say, hey,

559
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,700
this is the problem that I'm having
right now. Can you give me a tuneup?

560
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,380
And the brains, the brain mechanic
will say, Yep, here's the protocol.

561
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,300
I want you to do this.
I want you to write down this.

562
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:19,760
I want you to talk about this. I
want, and that's what they do. Yeah.

563
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,500
Mental Danger Signals back to the book.

564
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,680
Mental first aid is just as important
as physical first aid for preventing

565
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:32,870
casualties and losses to the service.

566
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,940
If a 1942 if a man can be relieved of
duty for a time given a rest when he needs

567
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:42,891
it urgently,

568
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:47,891
he can usually be counted upon to come
back to the combat presently with fresh

569
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,350
zest and vigor.
If however,

570
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:54,080
he's allowed to go on past his
mental breaking point without let up.

571
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,490
If he is permitted to wait
until he collapses or until
the urgency of his needs

572
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:00,710
makes him go on sick call voluntarily,

573
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:05,711
the chances are much smaller for his rapid
recovery checkout world war one shell

574
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:09,260
shock and that's what you end up with.

575
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Guys that are mentally destroyed by
the horror that they see and the on

576
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,830
remitting nonstop presence of this horror
you have to give guys breaks if they

577
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,890
need it.
Next,

578
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,900
the first thing to look for is anything
that makes a man stand out in an awkward

579
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,490
way from the others in his unit.

580
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:36,491
Anything that makes him look odd
to the other men marks him as not.

581
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,550
Does he stay by himself too much?

582
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,740
Does he go for long
periods without speaking?

583
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,010
Is he known to other men
as having strange ideas?

584
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:51,420
Does he find conditions intolerable
than other men get along under?

585
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:56,070
All right. Is He a problem in the
outfit? Refusing certain foods,

586
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,520
wetting the bed following
strange or peculiar practices?

587
00:35:59,521 --> 00:36:02,070
Does the sergeant regardless,
regardless peculiar.

588
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,360
Another thing to look for is any sudden
change in the soldier's own personality.

589
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:10,140
If he is a man who has been in the
outfit for a while, it's easy to,

590
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,090
it's easy to note a complete reversal of
habits or attitudes when the ordinarily

591
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:17,430
cheerful man becomes moody and depressed.

592
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,570
When the quiet orderly soldier becomes
boisterous and noisy and a disciplinary

593
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:25,020
problem. When the neat well groomed
man becomes dirty and disheveled,

594
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,070
let's his shoes going shined his
uniform on button his hair and combed.

595
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,580
When the dependable mangoes a
wall and starts drinking hard,

596
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:37,740
these are signs to look for for mental
trouble. They should be looked into.

597
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,400
The guard house may not be any help at
all. Sometimes it makes things even worse.

598
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:46,410
It's worse. So just because someone starts
getting in trouble, hey, you know what?

599
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:51,090
We do film in the brig as not going
to make things any better. In fact,

600
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:52,650
it could make things worse.

601
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:58,140
Back to the book when a man
has been through a particularly
trying experience in

602
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:02,130
combat without relief for a long period
under steady bombing or gunfire without

603
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:04,590
protection cutoff from other
troops are lost at sea.

604
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,840
More cute signs of war nerves may show up.

605
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,700
All men should know that these signs
are the natural result of fear and war

606
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:15,780
strain. They do not mean
that a man has gone insane,

607
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,560
but they do mean that he needs care.
Rest,

608
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:22,170
medical attention and mental first aid

609
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,600
and here's some signs of that.
Here's some signs of severe stress,

610
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,800
inability to sleep,

611
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,500
terrible nightmares in which the
battle is repeated over and over,

612
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:36,000
inability to eat, buzzing or humming in
his ears, shakiness, general weakness,

613
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,410
weakness in certain parts of his body
as the knees or the rest of dizziness.

614
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:43,830
Peculiar feelings in the heart,
fluttering, pounding, skipping a beat,

615
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,530
difficult breathing,
relentless combined,

616
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:51,180
but let restlessness combined with a
feeling of being penned in an overwhelming

617
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,940
desire to push people
and walls out of the way.

618
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,530
Rest is the principal cure for
these indications of Warner's

619
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,820
rest and the care of a medical man
who understands such cases and an

620
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:09,210
understanding on the part of the
soldier of what is wrong with him.

621
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,930
These feelings are natural enough for
anyone who's gone through the difficult

622
00:38:12,931 --> 00:38:13,950
conditions of combat,

623
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,310
but they are very frightening to a
man who does not expect them even more

624
00:38:17,311 --> 00:38:20,340
distressing than the shells or
bombs or torpedoes themselves.

625
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,540
This is when it's important to
understand what's happening.

626
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,700
If you don't know why you're shaking,

627
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:28,560
if you don't know why
you can't sleep at night,

628
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,620
if you don't know why you can't eat,
why you feel weak,

629
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,260
like there's why there's
ringing in your ears.

630
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,610
If you don't understand why
those things are happening, you,

631
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,710
it's going to be worst for you.
It's just unexpected.

632
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:43,450
It's unknown and we're
afraid of the unknown.

633
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,850
Officers who understand these matters
can do a great deal to relieve the men's

634
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:53,020
fears of war nerves and to prevent them
by their own calm recognition of the

635
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:57,910
fact of nerves and their costs. So
hey, officer's like, Hey man, look,

636
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,770
you just got you.
You've been out here a little too long.

637
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,760
We're going give you a little breather.

638
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,470
How the mind protects itself.
The body has defense mechanisms,

639
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:11,820
so has the mind to touch a piece of hot
metal and instantly you have withdrawn

640
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:13,380
your hand before you
know what you are doing.

641
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,000
If something flies towards your face,

642
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:17,490
you shut your eyes without stopping
to decide how to close them.

643
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,890
These are natural means
for self protection.

644
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
When the mind is attacked by
unpleasant ideas, dangerous fears.

645
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,140
It too has a way of withdrawing rough,

646
00:39:25,141 --> 00:39:27,660
turning away and shutting
out what cannot be endured.

647
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,930
When you see a man of ordinary co good
common sense become strangely blind to

648
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:33,600
facts.

649
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,870
Refuse to believe that his lost brother
has really been killed or refuse to see

650
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:39,810
that he's he himself is to
blame for a disastrous failure.

651
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:44,250
That man's mind is automatically
protecting itself from
a truth so bitter that

652
00:39:44,251 --> 00:39:48,910
he can't take it
little bit delusional.

653
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,350
It might be dangerous even where
it possible to convince them,

654
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,460
convince a man of the actual facts
he might if compelled to face them,

655
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:00,640
commit suicide.
That has happened more than once

656
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:07,290
and obstinate refusal to accept the truth
on the part of a man of ordinary good

657
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:12,490
judgment is a danger signal just as a
fever of 103 degrees is a signal of a

658
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:16,480
serious physical danger.
Don't try to argue with such a man.

659
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,600
He should be given a rest or a
furlough from the duty and the strain.

660
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:24,340
It is apparent that the mind is
hard hit when he is fit again,

661
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,260
he will be able to see clearly once more,

662
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:31,120
he will rate himself and go back to
normal just as the fever patient patient

663
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:33,040
does when its temperature goes back down,

664
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,410
but it is only when the mind's natural
protective mechanism are used to an

665
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:41,700
excessive or unreasonable
extent that they, that they,

666
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,130
that they point to a
sick or exhausted mine.

667
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,390
Every normal man uses them daily.
To some extent.

668
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,420
This is the way they work and it's goes
through a bunch of things that we all do

669
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,700
on a daily basis.

670
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,500
Normal people to deal with things.

671
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,510
One,
passing the buck.

672
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,770
You see this every day when a
man fails or or his humiliated,

673
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,850
he can shrug it off or freely admit his.
It is his own fault.

674
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,740
If the failure is trivial,

675
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,830
I did not mean much to him or
if he has strong character.

676
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,620
If the failure is a
great personal tragedy,

677
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,400
all but the man of an extraordinary
strength of character,

678
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:28,150
we'll try to put the blame
on someone or someone else,

679
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:34,100
someone or some thing else.
The man who thus fails,

680
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,640
we'll seize upon any plausible excuse.

681
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,410
He blames the weather,

682
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,120
the man who gave him wrong advice
or the man who got in his way.

683
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,120
Sometimes he may even imagine a plot
against himself and persuade him that

684
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:55,121
everybody is down on him humiliation and
defeat our hard to bear instinctively.

685
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,170
Every man wants to try it
once to get out from under.

686
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,570
When blame hangs over him.

687
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:07,670
Habits of good sportsmanship
usually prevent him from doing so,

688
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,270
but still in his own mind or
among friends, he will say,

689
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,100
but it wasn't my fault.

690
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:17,780
That's an amazing section,

691
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:23,950
obviously directly related to
the idea of extreme ownership.

692
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,620
The fact that it's only a
man of extraordinary strength
of character who will

693
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,460
take the blame. That's the only, that's
the only person everyone else is going to.

694
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,790
I think what's important about this is
to recognize that we all subconsciously

695
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:41,624
know this.

696
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,330
So when you screw something
up and you go, well, you know,

697
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,490
we didn't get the supplies we were
supposed to get and that's why we failed.

698
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,000
Everybody knows that.
That's a little character flaw.

699
00:42:53,001 --> 00:42:57,620
You got right there to shine through.
That's what's going on, right?

700
00:42:57,621 --> 00:43:00,560
It's a little character flaw
and you hear it all the time.

701
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,600
It's so obvious to everyone
when you're making an excuse.

702
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,750
Well, it, no one

703
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:14,240
believes your excuse. You don't
want, it leaves your excuse.

704
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,100
Even if everyone's making an
excuse. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

705
00:43:19,101 --> 00:43:23,570
It's still the subconscious. Everyone
let, let's say me, you, I dunno.

706
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,650
Lafe there's a bunch of people in a
room and we're all making excuses.

707
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,720
It almost seems like each
individual guy would be like,

708
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,840
oh, they're making excuses. Meanwhile,
like they're not thinking, oh,

709
00:43:35,841 --> 00:43:39,800
I'm making it uses too. You know?
It's a scary thing. And what's cool is

710
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,750
as soon as someone goes, hey, you know
what? This is actually my fault. Yeah.

711
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,120
Other people go,
Oh man,

712
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,300
I need to say that too, cause I
screwed some stuff up. Yeah, it's all,

713
00:43:51,301 --> 00:43:55,200
it's kind of like you ever been in like
a big meeting and it kind of goes off

714
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:58,880
the rails a little bit.
You have. Okay, good. Wait,

715
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:00,210
have you ever been in a big meeting?

716
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,880
What was your big meeting with like
your wife and your tickets? Believe me,

717
00:44:05,881 --> 00:44:08,440
that's a huge meeting.
The, and then, you know,

718
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,300
let's say it goes off the rails and people
start like essentially raising their

719
00:44:12,301 --> 00:44:15,120
voice. Maybe not yelling, but you
know, and I'll, everyone's talking,

720
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:16,560
you can't hear what anyone's saying.
Right.

721
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,200
But everyone's voicing their
opinions essentially, just,

722
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,500
just a little bit more passionately.
Right. But you can't hear anybody.

723
00:44:22,501 --> 00:44:24,520
What did anyone say? Right?
You know that happens a lot,

724
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,040
so it's kind of the same concept because
even when you are saying anything,

725
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,590
everyone else is talking. You're
compelled to be like, be quiet, but oh,

726
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,830
what you just do it there. You just
added to the noise with the thing.

727
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:44,820
Rather than like handling it kind
of consciously and be like, okay,

728
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:46,980
I'm not going to add to the noise.
I'm going to be quiet.

729
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:48,043
Yes.

730
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,420
Taking ownership is contagious
and making excuses is contagious.

731
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,280
They're both contagious.
Yeah.

732
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:00,230
They'll both run ramping wild until you
put a check on them. The good thing,

733
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:04,910
the good news about that
is taking ownership is the
stronger power. So if you,

734
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,940
if someone in that group starts to take
ownership that that virus will spread

735
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:16,310
stronger than the excuse making virus.

736
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,020
Okay. The next thing that
people do is the false front.

737
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,010
When a man is worried by the fear,
perhaps only half consciously,

738
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:31,610
but deep in his heart that he has
serious that he has a serious fault or

739
00:45:31,611 --> 00:45:33,110
weakness,
what does he do?

740
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:37,580
He puts up a great show of being
just the opposite sort of person.

741
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,780
If the man is stupid or ineffective yet
feels a need to be strong and sure he

742
00:45:41,781 --> 00:45:44,270
will overdo his efforts to impress people.

743
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,730
You will be loud and boisterous and cocky.

744
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,000
The timid person may do foolhardy
stunts seeking to prove his bravery.

745
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,540
The man who is really courageous,
strong and manly.

746
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,340
Seldom knee feels, any need to demonstrate
it. He just takes himself for granted.

747
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,130
So there's a bunch of bed,
obviously we see this all time.

748
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,260
People are insecure about
the way they do something.

749
00:46:11,261 --> 00:46:14,260
They try and give the false
front that they're great at it.

750
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,350
I remember when I was young and I bleached
my hair blonde did a few times by the

751
00:46:20,351 --> 00:46:21,610
way. That's interesting. Yeah.

752
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,400
So it wasn't like super
long and I'm like this,

753
00:46:24,401 --> 00:46:29,350
but it just shirt and us.
I was a girl, he said,

754
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:31,150
hey you,
you just do that for attention.

755
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:33,020
Yeah.

756
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,610
And I'm thinking to myself like, well I
don't like, I don't do it for attention.

757
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:40,600
You know, and then you thought
to yourself more, you know,

758
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:43,640
it kinda sticks with you.
Like am I doing it for attention?

759
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,370
I'm not realizing it kind of
thing. And some fee, you know,

760
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:49,930
you go round and round in
your head, you're like, then
why did I do it? You know,

761
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,680
do it, did I like, like
how it specifically looked
because it does stand out.

762
00:46:54,681 --> 00:46:58,420
I knew that from the beginning.
What age is this? Uh,

763
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:01,160
2020,
20,

764
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:07,010
21 maybe? Yeah, like 20th.
Okay. [inaudible] 97.

765
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:11,540
Yeah, 20. See, anyway, so after you
think about it, you're like, yeah,

766
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,770
cause you know,
I liked how it looked at the time and

767
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,000
yeah, I wanted people to sort of look, you
know, it was a, so then what did you do?

768
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:27,190
Nothing. Do you, didn't you kept I
admitted it to myself. Yeah, I kept it.

769
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,470
And then yeah, there's a lot. Uh,

770
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,300
there's a lot of wrestlers like the
high school wrestlers that do that.

771
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:38,950
There's whole teams, whole
teams. Everyone's got their
hair bleached blonde. Yeah.

772
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:43,260
Will it, cause there's a level of
arrogance which with wrestling. Yeah.

773
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,800
Well yeah, like self confidence.
Like, Hey, I'm going to
going to make this happen.

774
00:47:47,801 --> 00:47:52,510
And it's, it's a psychological game,
right? I'm not scared of you. Look at me.

775
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,430
I'm,
I actually bleached blonde,

776
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:59,431
my hair look at me cause I'm
about to stick you on the mat.

777
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,590
Okay.
So other than semantics,

778
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:07,180
is there a difference
between the expression I want
attention or I'm doing it

779
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:11,330
for attention versus I'm doing it to stand
out. I think those are the same thing,

780
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,350
but one kind of sounds more like
kind of superficial kindness.

781
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,110
So you just want attention. Yeah.
No I'm doing to stand out. You know,

782
00:48:19,111 --> 00:48:20,950
I want to stand out.
That's a good thing to stand up.

783
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,640
That's a not a great
argument is what I'm saying.

784
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,120
Being being the,
hey I just want to stand out.

785
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,870
That's the most positive possible way
of saying I just want attention. Yeah,

786
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:35,770
because what you want.
Yeah.

787
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:39,200
Cause if you say Elena
stand out cause you can um,

788
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,340
like try to stand out or pursue standing
out as a good thing for a good reason.

789
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,160
You know, like I wanna stand out,
I want my business to stand out.

790
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,580
I don't want my x, Y, z thing
to stand out. So, you know,

791
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:55,060
so people don't have no sign on it
or whatever. But if you're like,

792
00:48:55,061 --> 00:48:58,210
I want to do it for attention, it just
sounds like I just want the attention,

793
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:01,000
like if that's what I want,
that's the end goal of the attention.

794
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,070
That's what it feels like when you say it.

795
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,380
Even though there's sort of the
same thing. There are the things,

796
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,630
I was playing soccer when I was a kid

797
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:13,810
and my dad,
my parents were school teachers.

798
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,880
Yeah. They're not a lot of
money in school teaching and we,

799
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,310
my dad,
I needed a pair of cleats,

800
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:26,430
so I'm probably eight years old and my
dad goes to the sporting good store,

801
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:32,940
digs into the the bin of leftovers
second hand whenever any gets.

802
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:40,090
And the pair of cleats that fit me is
white. It's a pair of white cleats.

803
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:44,980
Yeah. This is 19 whatever. 78 does.

804
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:49,030
No one with white cleats. This is
not for, everyone has black lights.

805
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:54,850
So I go to the soccer
game and like I said,

806
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:58,840
I think we through white cleats. Cleats.
Yeah, because my dad, they were the cheap,

807
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:00,740
they went in the bargain bin.
Right.

808
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:04,900
It wasn't like my dad on the school
teacher's salary was like, hey,

809
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,950
which pair do you want from this rack
over here? No, you're getting the,

810
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:13,780
the new buck. You know what that is?
No, it's a fake leather, you know,

811
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:17,230
so you're just getting a fake leather
plastic cleats. They're white, whatever.

812
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,160
But I was out on the
soccer pitch and I think,

813
00:50:23,741 --> 00:50:27,830
I want to say I scored a goal I think,

814
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:31,660
and as I was running back,
uh,

815
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:37,090
so like a dad from the other
team said something like,

816
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,680
you know, you think you're the big
star now with those white cleats.

817
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:48,560
I don't know if he was being nice.
He might've been being nice.

818
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:50,780
It didn't sound like it to me at the time.

819
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,800
I think that right there was like
the beginning of me thinking,

820
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,000
I don't want to be the guy
that's dying their hair.

821
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,830
A bright blonde at 21 years old.
Yeah.

822
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:07,360
When you said maybe 21
you're going to be that.

823
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:09,620
You think you're going to be the big star
now he said something with those white

824
00:51:09,621 --> 00:51:11,060
cleats.
It was something like that.

825
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,650
I can't remember very much from
my childhood that I remember.

826
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,890
Remember when you were playing like the,
this is not some big soccer,

827
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,770
you know they got kids playing soccer now.

828
00:51:21,771 --> 00:51:25,460
They got there looking like a
professional soccer. No, this is,

829
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:27,680
you remember them things that you
had when you were a little kid.

830
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:32,630
That yellow shirt that was like elastic
around the bottom and you just put it on

831
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,351
over your other shirt.

832
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:36,950
So it was like the yellow team versus the
other team who was one of those things.

833
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,380
We're not talking high level, we're not
talking to high level soccer playing.

834
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:47,150
We're talking yellow jersey,
yellows against the regular kids.

835
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,743
Intermural.

836
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,810
So there I was with the white cleats on
and I remember thinking that guy thinks

837
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:58,160
that I'm trying to make a spectacle out
of myself. And he didn't say nice goal.

838
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,190
He said,
oh you think you got some Nice cleats?

839
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,170
Were you celebrating all hard or
something or you know, running thing.

840
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,790
I was running back. Yeah.
Yeah. He was hating.

841
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,680
I'm trying to think of when I celebrated
hard cause that's something that,

842
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:16,280
that's something I remember a couple of
times in my life celebrating hard and

843
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:19,550
being like, man that was a bad move. And
again, it's probably the same age group,

844
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:24,440
you know, like yeah, it's weird man.
That's, that's kind of deep though.

845
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:25,580
Were where that the,

846
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,680
cause it's the opposing team's
debt or somebody on their
feelings. Um, cause yeah,

847
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:32,690
I wonder right, because there's
two things that he couldn't be,

848
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,680
he was hating regardless and he was
a mad, you know, goal obviously.

849
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,370
But was he like, oh you think you're
the big shot now? Like hating on,

850
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,690
that's what I heard.
You're cool.

851
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,200
Or was he hating like on a
deeper level where he was like,

852
00:52:45,201 --> 00:52:48,650
oh you think you're a big shot?
Oh, but look here kind of thing.

853
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:53,651
Was he saying that the way I
interpreted it was he was saying,

854
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,110
you think you're special because
you've got those white cleats on.

855
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,010
He didn't know that.
Then we're the only place I got her.

856
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,070
Cause my dad's a notoriously cheap guy.
My Dad,

857
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:06,800
we could tell stories
about my dad. All, all 10,

858
00:53:06,801 --> 00:53:11,410
15 podcasts worth of penny
pinching come up from the old man.

859
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,100
So you weren't getting these normal
cleats. These are bargain bin cleats.

860
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,710
So that's what we're talking
about. Yes sir. Number three,

861
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:22,790
taking it out on the dog.

862
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:26,190
The man who suffered injury and
is not strong enough to hit back.

863
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:30,840
May literally take it out on the dog or
may go around looking for trouble with

864
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:35,490
someone else. He can talk back to a
punch in the, in the nose. Yeah, check.

865
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,360
Here's one borrowed virtue.

866
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,340
A more constructive or helpful sort
of mental protection mechanism is this

867
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,840
action of a man who feels
weak or inadequate by himself
and who gains a feeling

868
00:53:48,841 --> 00:53:52,710
of strength and superiority by attaching
themselves to a stronger man or a

869
00:53:52,711 --> 00:53:53,820
strong group.

870
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,010
It was this that sent so many men to
their recruiting stations on the morning

871
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:01,320
after Pearl Harbor.
As a man alone,

872
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:06,321
you feel powerless in the
face of threatening dangers
as United States soldier.

873
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,140
You know, you can go anywhere
in the world, avenge wrongs,

874
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,750
and protect your treasured way of life.
So if there's a positive way that we,

875
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:18,870
we we roll.
Number five is sick call.

876
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,590
When your mind is called upon to
face something you dread terribly,

877
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,920
your body may come,
come promptly to your rescue.

878
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:31,020
The aviation student who really dreads
to go up for his first solo feeling,

879
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:35,670
sure he is going to crack up his plane
may develop a convenient but real

880
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:39,650
headache on that day. He, yeah,

881
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,800
you see that happen, right? And
a little feel good. You speed.

882
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,810
It happened with little kids
to first Jiu Jitsu tournament.

883
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,640
He'd come sick first. Whatever
you know, first basketball game,

884
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,970
I'm feel good. Shut up. You feel fine

885
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,950
moving on the war within the man.

886
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:08,810
It might be much easier to defeat the
enemy if men could only win in some way.

887
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:13,980
The conflicts that very often
going go on within themselves.

888
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:20,670
A man. So this is, this
is where we go dichotomy.

889
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:23,520
The new level of dichotomy
be digging in right here.

890
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,900
A man so often wants to do two opposite
things at the same time and he wants

891
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,310
desperately to do both.

892
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,050
He wants to dominate other
men and yet be liked by them.

893
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,300
He wants to give vent to his anger,
but he doesn't want to get in hot water.

894
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,540
He wants to gain promotion, but it
doesn't want to do all the hard work.

895
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,530
Above all,

896
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:50,610
he wants to be a brave and treat true
soldier to keep the soldiers faith,

897
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:56,100
and yet he wants to live
how to be brave and safe.

898
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,460
That is the greatest psychological
problem for the soldier.

899
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:04,320
Most of the war neurosis,
mental illness in parentheses,

900
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:09,710
result from the failure of men to find
any sort of satisfactory way out of that

901
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:11,214
dilemma.

902
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,580
Every man is equipped with two kinds of
the deep seated desires or instincts.

903
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:23,040
Often these two conflict, one set has
to do with his relations with other men.

904
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,080
He wants to be one of the gang appreciated
and admired by others and he even

905
00:56:28,361 --> 00:56:31,690
likes to sacrifice himself for the
good of the group to which he belongs,

906
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:35,470
whether it is his family,
church, army, or nation,

907
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,580
but he also has another set of desires
that cannot ever be entirely denied

908
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,910
desires connected with himself. His
life has comfort, his personal freedom.

909
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:52,590
No amount of patriotic fervor can wholly
kill or drown out the calls of the more

910
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:54,400
personal instincts.

911
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,970
Only a few rush to enlist
with no misgivings.

912
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,830
Most for most men,

913
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:04,090
there is some concern or distress in
making the decision to leave home,

914
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,930
family and job in order to join
the service of the country.

915
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:14,670
A move to a war theater and an advanced
to close contact with the enemy usually

916
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:20,050
brings a crisis in the battle within
the soldier as well as in the battle

917
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:23,800
against the enemy. When a man finds
himself close indeed to death,

918
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:26,230
that his instinct to self preservation,

919
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:31,180
one of the most powerful urges every
normal man has makes every fiber of his

920
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:36,010
being protested against facing the danger.
Yet his comrades,

921
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:37,630
his officer's his country,

922
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:41,740
are all counting on him to
do his bit a pretty big bit,

923
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,640
risking his own life.
Yet they are counting on him.

924
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,860
If the personal instincts,
when the struggle, the man,

925
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:55,540
when contact with the enemy forces is
made, we'll run away or will surrender.

926
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,810
If the social instincts prevail,

927
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,220
then he is the stuff of which all
good soldiers, all heroes are made.

928
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,350
Most men who have traveled the hard path
of army life up to the front lines put

929
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:12,790
up a good fight once they get
there for a few. So there you go.

930
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:16,150
You either have guys that go, okay, you
know what? Of course I want to stay alive,

931
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:20,440
but I'm going to be loyalty to my country,
my army,

932
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,670
my team that I'm with and the guy to my
left and my right. And so guess what?

933
00:58:24,671 --> 00:58:28,570
I'm going forward into the fray.
The other that,

934
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:30,760
that make the other decision
arc. Well, you know what?

935
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,650
I want to stay alive
so I'm gonna run away.

936
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,510
So there's two distinct types of
behaviors. Most of the time it's, hey,

937
00:58:37,511 --> 00:58:38,410
we're gonna put up the good fight.

938
00:58:38,411 --> 00:58:42,160
Occasionally it's a coward and then
this is the interesting one for a few.

939
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:45,640
However, this struggle ends
in a stalemate, a compromise.

940
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,060
That is what a war neurosis is.

941
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,220
A compromise of this internal conflict.

942
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,310
If a man goes on being torn
by as conflicting desires,

943
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:59,110
if he cannot bring himself to go forward
yet is to conscientious to give up,

944
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:04,260
he will suffer from the type of neurosis
characterized by anxiety he finds he

945
00:59:04,571 --> 00:59:08,080
can no longer concentrate. He becomes
confused. The expression on his face,

946
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:11,980
his pulse rate and his rapid breathing
betray the fierce battle going on with

947
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:12,940
him within him.

948
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:17,110
He himself may not be fully aware of
the cause of this terrible sense of fear

949
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,220
and horror of it seems to hang over him.
Yet he is in a way solving his problem.

950
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,760
He is making himself too
inefficient to continue to fight,

951
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,320
yet giving himself so much suffering
that is conscious cannot accuse him of

952
00:59:30,321 --> 00:59:33,740
taking the easy way out yet even so,

953
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,890
he does not know that
he is doing all this.

954
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,440
His nervous system does it for him.

955
00:59:40,370 --> 00:59:44,120
The man who suffers in any of these ways
is not to be blamed. He's not a coward.

956
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:48,080
If he were, he would have no
conflict. That's an interesting point,

957
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:50,120
so if you're just a coward, you just
like, screw it, I'm out of here.

958
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:54,500
But the guy that freezes up and to
get so nervous he doesn't want to run,

959
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:57,320
but he doesn't want to go fight.
He can't solve that conflict in his head.

960
00:59:58,130 --> 01:00:01,220
Back to the book. If he were,
he would have no conflict.

961
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,630
He would see to it that he was
not at the front but in a soft,

962
01:00:05,631 --> 01:00:10,070
safe job somewhere at a good distance
in if necessary he would dessert,

963
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:12,980
but he does not dessert
and still does not fight.

964
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:17,030
He compromises with a difficult,

965
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,810
unpleasant alternative one
which he does not choose,

966
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:25,460
but which has nervous system chooses
for him. He cannot control it.

967
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,380
The leader who lectures him balls amount
or punish as him for neglect of duty is

968
01:00:30,381 --> 01:00:33,110
only to increase his trouble.
On the other hand,

969
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,430
coddling such men is a mistake too, so
you can't go to, you got to balance this.

970
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:39,950
You can't go super hard on them,
but you can't coddle them either.

971
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:44,780
You need to balance this dichotomy.
What they need is understanding,

972
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:45,880
help the reinsurer,

973
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,280
reassurance that comes from a firm but
friendly attitude on the part of those

974
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:50,114
who deal with them.

975
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:54,950
They need the encouragement of assurance
that such things happen to the best of

976
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:59,120
men, but that men may get over
such difficulties with aid.

977
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:03,050
They need to be told that they will
be helped by a good night's sleep,

978
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,200
perhaps drug induced by the
medical officer by a good
meal and by rest and that

979
01:01:09,201 --> 01:01:14,120
then they will be expected to return the
f to the fight and do their duty with

980
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:14,954
the others.

981
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:21,620
So that's a pretty interesting way
of looking at it. And I would say,

982
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:26,630
as I thought about that, think
about how many, how much,

983
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,460
how much nervousness you feel.

984
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,020
If you think about the nervousness is
actually it's an internal war between two

985
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:35,990
decisions that you could be making,
right? Yeah. What should I do?

986
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:39,740
Should I buy this new car or save
the money, right? Like, well,

987
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:42,680
which one should I do? I really want the
car. But I know it should save money.

988
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,940
You get this little internal internal
conflict and that's what the struggle is.

989
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:49,880
You're not really actually nervous
about buying the new car and you're not

990
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:51,140
nervous and I'll save money.
Your nerve,

991
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:55,370
you can't make a decision based on the
two things that you want to make happen.

992
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,990
So we get those little, I think
it's, if you, if you frame things up,

993
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:03,080
if you're feeling
stressed about something,

994
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:06,920
if you frame up what is
actually stressing you out,

995
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:09,680
there's a good chance of what's actually
stressing you out is you're just trying

996
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:13,310
to figure out which decision to
make. Yeah, yeah. That is true.

997
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,970
And one thing that you can do is you can,
if you play your card,

998
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,100
if your brain plays the game out,
you can be so you can

999
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,150
not make a decision. Oh yeah. Because
hey, you're just not making a decision.

1000
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,080
It's like that.
It's crazy how they,

1001
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,620
I mean that's the first I've heard anyone
articulate that little bit. Cause Bro,

1002
01:02:31,621 --> 01:02:35,400
I'll get that in the most
like stupid mundane things.

1003
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,130
So okay.

1004
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Bear with me some with some
unloading unloading the dishwasher.

1005
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,120
So on this side of my kitchen,
which is like,

1006
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:50,940
it's kind of a longer like kind
of kitchen where, so on this side,

1007
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:52,580
this is where pots go the,

1008
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:56,100
but it's not just positive to pots and
then certain kinds of little these little

1009
01:02:56,101 --> 01:02:57,360
soy sauce dishes.
And,

1010
01:02:57,790 --> 01:03:01,530
and then on this side it's like silverware
and then there's like plates, right?

1011
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:05,100
So I'm unloading the dishwasher and I'm
trying to be efficient. I'm not rushing,

1012
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:08,910
but I'm trying to be efficient. So
I'm grabbing, I have like, you know,

1013
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:12,360
I get like maybe four
dishes of sorts at a time.

1014
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:14,460
And so,

1015
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:19,461
but I look at what I grabbed
and I get this feeling like,

1016
01:03:19,801 --> 01:03:23,160
shoot, where do I go? Do I
go here first? You know, and

1017
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,660
put away the pots first that I
have in my hand or doing over here.

1018
01:03:27,661 --> 01:03:29,970
Because if I go over here, I can
do that, you know, kind of thing.

1019
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:33,090
And I'm at this little conundrum, but
I'm like, you know what I should do,

1020
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:34,260
and this is all just going on in my head.

1021
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,120
It takes maybe like four or five seconds,
but

1022
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:41,550
it seems kind of long.
But I don't want her,

1023
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,760
you ain't making videos during their
debate yourself about pots and pans and

1024
01:03:44,761 --> 01:03:48,290
glasses and soy sauce dishes.
Who has a soy sauce dish?

1025
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:51,060
Is that an actual thing bro?

1026
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,270
It's bad because this is Lee.
I'm not exaggerating.

1027
01:03:54,271 --> 01:03:57,840
This literally goes into my head and
it's this micro little almost anxiety.

1028
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:01,850
This is not exact, but it's
like it's there. It's something.
It's not like nothing,

1029
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,530
you know? I'm not just like, oh, just
making, taking action. I'm not doing that.

1030
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:08,550
I'm like literally standing there not
doing anything, thinking about this stuff.

1031
01:04:09,090 --> 01:04:09,930
So I'm like,
okay,

1032
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,420
why have not in a situation where you
have to make actual decisions, boom,

1033
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:18,390
that would be a problem. If this is
any indicator, it will be a problem.

1034
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,900
So I'm looking and I'm like, shoot, where
should I go straight to the that I said,

1035
01:04:21,901 --> 01:04:25,530
no, you know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna put, put this whole site.

1036
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,210
Is this the dishes that go on this side?

1037
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,740
Because I'm going to put
those back home to grab stuff.

1038
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,420
They've all gone that tight.
But wait,

1039
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:33,810
now I've got to take the time to put this
back in, searching and grab other ones.

1040
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:37,950
I'm losing time. That's less efficient
given the point that I'm at right now.

1041
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,700
So I'm like, man. And then you know, and
then of course I'll just be like, yeah,

1042
01:04:41,701 --> 01:04:45,710
whatever. I'll just kind of
go. But the point is, Brad,

1043
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:49,830
that happens is it literally happens
if it happening happening to you.

1044
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:53,530
Echo Charles with the dishes.
Yeah.

1045
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:57,210
I can imagine that other people feel it
when there's actual decisions to be made.

1046
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:58,790
And just to wrap this whole thing up,

1047
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:03,450
and I don't want to talk about that
anymore ever. But if you were smart,

1048
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:07,380
you would just organize your kitchen so
that everything is located co located.

1049
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:10,320
All things that go from dishwasher
go into this small area.

1050
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:12,960
So think about that one.
Well,

1051
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:16,410
don't think about it for too long because
I don't want you to freaking stress

1052
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,730
out anxiety,

1053
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,020
but that a lot of those like he that
he puts it in terms of like a two time

1054
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:28,030
kinds of instincts, right? Yeah. What
social and we're social human survival.

1055
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:32,350
Yeah.
It's like a big one is a way to see it.

1056
01:05:32,351 --> 01:05:35,080
It's like how you pointed
out to me like the long game,

1057
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:37,090
you know it's like either you're
playing the short game, the long game.

1058
01:05:37,091 --> 01:05:39,040
So it's kind of like that.
Like there's like you,

1059
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:40,780
you had the example of
the buying the car thing.

1060
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:43,330
That's the short term versus
long term payoffs situation.

1061
01:05:43,331 --> 01:05:46,800
Most things are when you have that
little conundrum, you know, like you,

1062
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,680
I'm gonna eat this pot of brown
or at least pan of brownies,

1063
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,710
but I want to eat those products because
they're delicious but I don't want to

1064
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:56,680
get, you know, you know, put on
weight or whatever. You know,

1065
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:59,260
it's kind of the same thing I
want both kind of thing. But,

1066
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:01,330
and they most of the time I think anyway,

1067
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,240
it sorts itself out to be a short
term versus long term struggle.

1068
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:07,420
And I think the important thing here is
that you can actually take this concept

1069
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:10,660
and apply it to meaningful decisions
that human beings have to make.

1070
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,320
Not just soy sauce bowls and brownies.

1071
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,970
No Diet is a big one day.
It is. It's not a big one.

1072
01:06:18,971 --> 01:06:21,760
When you compare it to storming
the beaches of you. Oh, Jima.

1073
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:26,050
Just saying I agree with that.
Yes sir. And speaking of which,

1074
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,570
and this is where this is obviously,
this is part here,

1075
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:32,140
is probably written more
directed at you back to the book.

1076
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:36,550
Men differ greatly in their abilities
to stand up under this internal personal

1077
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:37,384
conflicts.

1078
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:43,710
Most men can come successfully
through terrorizing experiences,

1079
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,210
revolting scenes and exposure to it.

1080
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:51,160
Def War is older than history in all
nations and tribes have resorted to it.

1081
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:52,323
So

1082
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:57,180
even the terrorizing experience that you
have. Yeah, with the soy sauce bowls.

1083
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,710
Oh, that one's garden. That's rough.

1084
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:07,380
Continuing.
The average soldier has conflicts,

1085
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,250
but settles them himself
with no one else the wiser.

1086
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,760
So he finds himself free to fight
with his whole strength on him.

1087
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:19,140
The average free soldier victory depends.
Fortunately,

1088
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,220
the first contact with the enemy
is the hardest in seasons. Troops,

1089
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:27,270
internal conflict diminishes.
They have faced the worst and no,

1090
01:07:27,271 --> 01:07:32,100
it is not intolerable. Even soldiers
who have to retreat or not defeated.

1091
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:36,180
If they have learned to
conquer their own fears,

1092
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:43,580
that's a good one. Even soldiers
who have to retreat or not defeated,

1093
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,950
if they have learned to conquer their own
fears, they will advanced another time.

1094
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:54,190
Having once won the fight with the inner
man and having faced the reality of

1095
01:07:54,441 --> 01:07:55,640
battle,
finding it,

1096
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,760
finding it less terror and
more opportunity for success
than the green recruit

1097
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:03,800
could ever have believed possible.

1098
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:06,663
Yeah.

1099
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:11,890
So now we get to this section
in the book and like I said,

1100
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:13,850
this is the second that I
actually wanted to cover,

1101
01:08:13,851 --> 01:08:17,090
but we ended up covering this whole
on over the course of three podcasts.

1102
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,780
And this section is called leadership.

1103
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:25,880
You can't boss a brick,

1104
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:30,770
you can't even boss a dog unless the dog
has been trained to obey and has formed

1105
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:34,400
habits of responding to commands.
And before you can boss him,

1106
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:38,180
you must know what commands you will
spawn to the famous seeing eye dogs can do

1107
01:08:38,181 --> 01:08:39,590
wonderful things to aid the blind.

1108
01:08:39,591 --> 01:08:42,920
But both dog and master must first
go through a period of training.

1109
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,183
So there you go.

1110
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:47,790
Okay.

1111
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,660
And now we get this off.
40 is not power.

1112
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,250
Yeah,

1113
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:57,480
that's an epic statement.
Listen to this.

1114
01:08:57,780 --> 01:09:02,780
No amount of legal authority over the
grizzly bears of British Columbia would

1115
01:09:02,821 --> 01:09:06,300
enable you to get yourself
obeyed by them out in the woods.

1116
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:13,530
Men can be commanded only after they
have acquired habits of obeying after and

1117
01:09:13,531 --> 01:09:13,801
after.

1118
01:09:13,801 --> 01:09:17,280
Their leader has learned to give them
commands that make these habits work.

1119
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,420
All successful leadership dust depends
on the habits of those who are to be led.

1120
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,770
The officer's standing before his men
is limited in the direct exercise of his

1121
01:09:25,771 --> 01:09:30,390
authority by what the troops are able
to get through their eyes and ears.

1122
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,110
So this is this interesting you're going
to see in this opening section here.

1123
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:37,800
It's really leaning towards that
traditional military id of leadership.

1124
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:40,140
It's like, look, if you're trained
correctly and I give you an order,

1125
01:09:40,141 --> 01:09:42,780
you're going to listen.
And so that's,

1126
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:46,230
that's where this thing
kind of starts off with.

1127
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,000
And as you probably can figure out,

1128
01:09:48,001 --> 01:09:52,620
that's contrary to to what I believe
effective leadership to consist of.

1129
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,020
But it's talking about it.

1130
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:59,730
And even though I don't believe that's
the most effective form of leadership.

1131
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,970
And a matter of fact, I know it's not
the most effective form of leadership.

1132
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:08,190
That being said,
it is a form of leadership and it is,

1133
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:13,050
it can be effective. It does work
in many situations where it's like,

1134
01:10:13,051 --> 01:10:15,190
look, I'm the boss, I'm the one
that's right. The paychecks,

1135
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:18,480
I'm the one that's got the rank and
when I tell you to do something,

1136
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:19,560
you know you're going to get it done.

1137
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:23,730
And that is a normal sort of baseline,

1138
01:10:23,731 --> 01:10:24,870
rudimentary,

1139
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:26,690
okay

1140
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:30,650
form of leadership. So it
does exist. Back to the book,

1141
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:32,210
when a 40 is not obeyed,

1142
01:10:32,211 --> 01:10:37,211
the fault may lie in the manner of speech
of the leader or else it may be that

1143
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:40,660
the men are, are in need of basic
training. So it looks so you look,

1144
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,170
if people aren't listening to you,
it could be the,

1145
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:46,370
the way that you're talking to them.
And now it starts to,

1146
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:51,290
and the reason I said this is starting
off talking about type of leadership that

1147
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,050
I don't really find to be optimum at all.

1148
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:57,680
But you're going to see that it starts
to lead towards the type of leadership

1149
01:10:57,681 --> 01:11:01,370
that I do believe to be effective and
they actually believe it to be the most

1150
01:11:01,371 --> 01:11:02,960
effective too.
So continue on.

1151
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:06,080
It is often said that a good
leader knows how to handle his men

1152
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,260
actually. However, it is not possible
for any leader to handle his men.

1153
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:13,440
Okay?

1154
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,070
It is

1155
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,780
himself that he handles.
Okay.

1156
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Then the men react to his department and
the way in which they react to pens in

1157
01:11:22,161 --> 01:11:25,700
term on their habits
of thought and action.

1158
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:29,990
So that's a great statement
of being the leader.

1159
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,710
It's it's you don't handle your men,
you handle yourself.

1160
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,140
You're the one that you need to handle.

1161
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:38,300
And then if you handle yourself correctly,

1162
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:42,440
the team will then react to the
way that you handle yourself.

1163
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:46,580
So that now we're starting to lean towards
what I believe to be good leadership.

1164
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:51,500
That's leading by example.
Next section. Discipline

1165
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:53,960
in an army.

1166
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:58,850
Much of this training on which leadership
depends is established by discipline.

1167
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:03,140
Discipline is training in the
habits of attention and obedience.

1168
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:07,580
Without such habits, we might have
a crowd or a mob, but not an army.

1169
01:12:07,850 --> 01:12:09,710
It is quite possible to lead a mob.

1170
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:14,750
Yet such leadership is uncertain depending
largely on the accidents of personal

1171
01:12:14,751 --> 01:12:18,350
appearance and unfortunate
timing in an army. However,

1172
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,190
there have been many leaders of many
ranks and they have been interchangeable.

1173
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:23,400
Okay.

1174
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,930
If a leader is killed, another must be
ready to take his place and lead men.

1175
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:34,310
So it's talking about discipline and this
is talking about the traditional form

1176
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:38,030
of military discipline. Hey,
there's a rank structure.

1177
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:43,360
You must be obedient and that is not
the optimal type of discipline that I

1178
01:12:44,511 --> 01:12:48,980
believe in, which is, hey, we are a
discipline team. We have discipline,

1179
01:12:48,981 --> 01:12:51,830
standard operating procedures.
We understand what the mission is,

1180
01:12:51,831 --> 01:12:53,120
we understand what the goals are.

1181
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:58,300
We are going to move in that direction
with discipline and the discipline is not

1182
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:01,820
imposed.
Discipline that I impose on my team,

1183
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:05,690
it's disciplined that they impose on
themselves because they realize that it

1184
01:13:05,691 --> 01:13:08,870
makes them more effective and more
efficient and more likely to be able to

1185
01:13:08,871 --> 01:13:11,180
accomplish the mission
which they believe in.

1186
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:17,520
Now it talks a little bit
about learning obedience.

1187
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,333
Okay.

1188
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,940
And again, obedience to me
is not something that I'm
looking for for my team.

1189
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:26,450
It's not what I'm looking for.
I'm not looking for obedience.

1190
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:30,020
I'm looking for people that know how to
understand what the goal is and they're

1191
01:13:30,021 --> 01:13:30,854
going to move towards the goal.

1192
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:31,883
Hmm.

1193
01:13:33,370 --> 01:13:36,130
The first requisite of
command is attention.

1194
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:40,330
So you got to get people to pay
attention to you. That makes sense.

1195
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:45,780
What men do invariably and repeatedly
is finally drilled into them,

1196
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:48,370
becomes for them.
Second Nature,

1197
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:52,090
they learned to perform acts or maneuvers
and response to commands or orders.

1198
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,500
Because the commando order has always
been accompanied by the act and the act by

1199
01:13:56,501 --> 01:14:01,240
the command. Mere lecturing never
trains men in action. At best,

1200
01:14:01,241 --> 01:14:03,940
it makes them learn mere words sequences,

1201
01:14:03,941 --> 01:14:08,080
except when the listeners already know
enough about the required action to

1202
01:14:08,081 --> 01:14:12,430
perform it. An imagination
learning new, in other words,

1203
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,810
requires participation.

1204
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:18,130
You don't learn to swim by taking
a correspondence course. So yes,

1205
01:14:18,131 --> 01:14:19,360
you have to drill people.
You have to get it,

1206
01:14:19,361 --> 01:14:22,690
make it second nature that that is true.
And we do that in,

1207
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:24,580
we did that in the seal teams.
They do that in the military.

1208
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:27,720
People know what they're gonna do when
they get shot at. They know what the,

1209
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,810
from a certain direction,

1210
01:14:28,811 --> 01:14:31,780
everyone knows what they're gonna do
and we drill it over and over and over

1211
01:14:31,781 --> 01:14:36,370
again until you don't have to think about
it. It's second nature. Unfortunately,

1212
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:40,480
bad habits as well as good can be learned.
If on spoken command,

1213
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:43,600
men do not respond,
then they are learning not to respond.

1214
01:14:43,870 --> 01:14:46,540
Whenever they are ordered to
do something they cannot do.

1215
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:49,570
They are learning to
disobey military manuals.

1216
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,670
Embody this fact in a rule.

1217
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,690
Never give a command that you
do not expect to be obeyed.

1218
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:59,920
Now that's a brilliant statement and I
don't necessarily think it's a brilliant

1219
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:04,360
statement for the same reasons,
but actually pretty close.

1220
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:06,290
If you wait,
if,

1221
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:11,320
if I'm looking at you and
you're working for me and I say,

1222
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:15,190
yeah, you need to get all this stuff move
by by noon today and I know there's no

1223
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:19,540
physical way for you to do it,
I'm wasting it. And, um, um,

1224
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:23,950
I'm diminishing my authority over
you because you're thinking, no,

1225
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:26,980
there's no way I can do that. So now
you're definitely not going to do it.

1226
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:31,030
And the next time I say to get
something done, you've got to,

1227
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:34,900
you've got to already a
preconceived notion that you
don't really have to do it.

1228
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:38,890
So that's a great statement.
If you're in charge,

1229
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,900
never give a command that you don't
expect to be obeyed. Don't do it.

1230
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,520
Keep your mouth shut. Figured out
something that can be done. Thus,

1231
01:15:48,521 --> 01:15:52,540
a young leader when he finds himself
so situated that his command might be

1232
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,030
disregarded,
must refrain from giving it.

1233
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:58,380
He must first tried to change the
situation, capture the attention.

1234
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:01,470
He must merely wait until he is reasonably
certain that when he gives us the

1235
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:03,460
order,
it will indeed be obeyed.

1236
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:07,060
So it makes sense.

1237
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:12,130
And now we get into the
section called the leader.

1238
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:18,270
And this is now where we start to come
towards the vision of leadership or the,

1239
01:16:18,381 --> 01:16:20,680
the principles of
leadership that I believe in

1240
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:24,760
back to the book.

1241
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:29,440
A good leader does not depend solely on
the authority that discipline gives him.

1242
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,800
As an officer or noncommissioned officer
for good leadership goes far beyond

1243
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:40,570
discipline. Look, good experience
leader inspires respect,

1244
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:43,150
confidence,
and loyalty in his subordinates,

1245
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:48,180
all of which enable him to get from his
men performance far above what a new

1246
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:53,400
leader could command. So there you go.
All this stuff that we just talked about,

1247
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:54,730
you've got to train them.
You got to have discipline.

1248
01:16:54,731 --> 01:16:56,260
You've got to make sure they're
going to obey your orders.

1249
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:57,250
You got to teach him obedience.

1250
01:16:57,340 --> 01:17:02,340
All that stuff is nothing compared
to the power of respect of loyalty.

1251
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:07,210
Continuing on in this,

1252
01:17:07,211 --> 01:17:10,250
the leader can rely on
the generous of his men.

1253
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:15,320
For men have a natural longing to respect
and have affection for their leaders.

1254
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:19,610
They want to be proud of their officers
and noncommissioned officers just as

1255
01:17:19,611 --> 01:17:24,230
they want to be proud of their unit
and their branch of service.

1256
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,160
When the,
when the new army was first being formed,

1257
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:31,010
many of the officers had
little experience in command.

1258
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:35,300
They had learned the words were capable
of giving directions and instructions,

1259
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:39,320
but they had learned neither the action
nor the manner that go with the command.

1260
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,540
A young officer would utter an order,

1261
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:44,930
but his manner would betray
his lack of confidence.

1262
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:50,060
This uncertainty was in effect a signal
for not carrying the order out promptly

1263
01:17:50,061 --> 01:17:54,830
and effectively. As military orders
must be carried out all our lives,

1264
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:59,510
we have depended on the manor and behavior
of others as well as on their speech

1265
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,130
to know what is in their minds. Army
discipline cannot change human nature.

1266
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,600
What did Sarah Armstrong say that 70%
of conveyed message in a conversation is

1267
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:16,490
from like nonverbal,
nonverbal cues.

1268
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:18,440
That's massive.
Yeah.

1269
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:23,570
I wonder if that includes like
tone or not. I don't think it does.

1270
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:26,720
Technically wouldn't cause
that's a verbal cue. Yeah,

1271
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,270
so we know that whatever the number is,

1272
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:34,900
it's a massive amount to a massive amount
that is conveyed by what your posture

1273
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:37,860
is, what your delivery looks
like, what you're counting,

1274
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:42,740
it's reads all those things and then
it lets include tone in it, right?

1275
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:45,590
Which the tone should
be in there somewhere.

1276
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:50,210
If you're giving orders and you look
like you don't know what you're doing and

1277
01:18:50,211 --> 01:18:53,630
your sound like you don't know you're
doing and you're using a tone that sounds

1278
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:54,740
like you don't know what you're doing,

1279
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:00,040
you're not going to get a lot of jumping
in there to execute what you're telling

1280
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:00,530
me.

1281
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:03,770
Yeah. Pie. That is nuts.
Because when you think about it,

1282
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:06,050
I mean even saying that you start
to think about what at what,

1283
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:07,730
like all the little things,

1284
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,350
all of them that you're doing while
you're saying something or trying to say

1285
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:14,240
something like even blinking,

1286
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:19,130
like even if you blinked one time versus
10 times, just blinking that teeny,

1287
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:22,270
teeny, tiny thing when you
said, you know, like Bruh,

1288
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:25,070
it's like you're saying something
completely different. Even if, yeah.

1289
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:28,960
Even though like when I'm talking to
people, I will not blink. I, yeah.

1290
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,250
I noticed that very,

1291
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,370
very early on in our relationship that
you don't really blame when you're

1292
01:19:34,371 --> 01:19:35,450
talking,
but I will look,

1293
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,520
I [inaudible] the weird thing is is
I'm not consciously doing that kind of

1294
01:19:41,181 --> 01:19:45,590
thing. Yeah. But I do know that it's
happening. Yeah. And Man, when I,

1295
01:19:45,591 --> 01:19:49,220
when I first started making videos,
I noticed it a lot. So you know,

1296
01:19:49,221 --> 01:19:52,160
cause I noticed like villains
and characters, certain types,

1297
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:55,370
quote unquote types of characters.
So one a villain.

1298
01:19:56,270 --> 01:20:00,310
When an actor is playing a villain and
he's saying something that's evil or

1299
01:20:00,311 --> 01:20:03,500
whatever and he's blinking
Brah I don't buy it at all.

1300
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,740
It's the fact you kind of can't really
buy it. But if they're saying something,

1301
01:20:06,741 --> 01:20:09,390
what if it's important in whatever
way and they're not blinking.

1302
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:13,530
It's almost like, man, that alone
sells it so much. Just that alone.

1303
01:20:13,531 --> 01:20:16,230
Of course there's other stuff,
but like, yeah, what? Blinking.

1304
01:20:16,231 --> 01:20:19,890
Even like wrinkling your forehead kind
of thing. Like all these little things.

1305
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:24,120
So it goes so deep that you
know you can take two people.

1306
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:26,820
One guy does hand motions
all the time and he just,

1307
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:30,270
he moves his hands a lot when he talks
and the other guy does the exact opposite.

1308
01:20:30,271 --> 01:20:34,110
He moves his hands so little that
it's noticeable. It's not that,

1309
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:37,420
oh he lacks verbal communication.
It's his INAC.

1310
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:42,360
It's that his inaction is
his verbal communication.

1311
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,871
See what I'm saying?

1312
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:46,920
So it's not like he has less verbal
communication than the guy who uses his

1313
01:20:46,921 --> 01:20:48,360
hands.
He has just as much,

1314
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,570
he's just saying something completely
different because he's still,

1315
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:52,141
see what I'm saying?

1316
01:20:52,141 --> 01:20:55,920
So it's like just all these nonverbal
things that's deep pecos man. Yeah.

1317
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,290
And this is where self awareness,

1318
01:20:58,291 --> 01:21:02,880
this is where role playing and
most important cause, cause look,

1319
01:21:03,990 --> 01:21:08,400
you're not gonna, you're not going to
become an academy award winning actor.

1320
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:13,710
So what you actually need to do is
believe in what you're saying. Yeah.

1321
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:16,290
That's what you need to do. Because if
you don't believe in what you're saying,

1322
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:20,220
your troops are looking at you again,
he doesn't even believe this.

1323
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,700
Why am I going to go charge this machine
gun nest when this guy doesn't even

1324
01:21:23,701 --> 01:21:25,470
believe that he should be
charged in this machine gun nest.

1325
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:29,040
And yet if you truly believe
that this is what should go down,

1326
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:34,260
people will see that you believe it
and they're going to follow. Yeah.

1327
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:37,470
So how you feel about this? Because
it might be slightly separate. Okay.

1328
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:41,670
So you know how people,
they'll give you the advice you want to,

1329
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:44,250
you want to act confident. You want to
be confident when you do this stuff,

1330
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:46,110
even if you're not confident or whatever.

1331
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,040
So it's kind of like people can smell
when you're not confident and you're

1332
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:51,060
acting confidence.

1333
01:21:51,061 --> 01:21:54,510
They way they can smell it when you're
trying to act casual or an actory lack

1334
01:21:54,511 --> 01:21:57,420
per how I can see, you
know, everyone can see that,

1335
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:01,200
but if you do it enough,
doesn't it start?

1336
01:22:01,230 --> 01:22:02,680
Don't you get kind of good at it?

1337
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:07,900
That's the advice that I give people
isn't go be confident when you talk to

1338
01:22:09,151 --> 01:22:12,480
people.
What I say is when you talk to people,

1339
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:15,640
make sure you know what
you're talking about. Yeah.

1340
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:19,830
Because if you know what you're talking
about, you will come across as confident.

1341
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:24,780
Why will you come across as confident?
Because you are confident now.

1342
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:25,111
Sure.

1343
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:29,340
There's some people that have some
natural ability to act confident even when

1344
01:22:29,341 --> 01:22:30,001
they're not.
Yes,

1345
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:33,750
and there's also some people that can
be very convincing and telling people to

1346
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:36,390
do something that they don't actually
believe it. That's very rare.

1347
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:39,480
It's very rare.
And even if I feel like those people,

1348
01:22:39,481 --> 01:22:41,190
and obviously I don't know
cause I don't know the people,

1349
01:22:41,191 --> 01:22:43,680
but it seemed like those are the people,
they're just used to doing it.

1350
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:47,130
They're used to telling tall
tales with complete confidence,

1351
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,190
but you can see how people,

1352
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,830
if they repeat repeatedly
talk about the same thing.

1353
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:54,330
Certainly they get better at it.

1354
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:58,530
And can they take that
too far where they're just
turning into a robot that's up

1355
01:22:58,531 --> 01:23:00,480
there reciting something that
they've heard and people go,

1356
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:03,600
oh this guy just got this memorized.
Cause that's jacked up too, right?

1357
01:23:04,050 --> 01:23:06,080
Like if you just go, oh, this guy's

1358
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,390
just memorize this thing
and he's not really into it.

1359
01:23:11,010 --> 01:23:15,890
Right. That's not a good sign
either. Yeah. People can see
through that. Yeah. If he,

1360
01:23:15,910 --> 01:23:17,620
yeah. If it's like, yeah man,

1361
01:23:17,621 --> 01:23:21,310
u fan manufactured enthusiasm
or something like that. Yeah.

1362
01:23:21,311 --> 01:23:25,320
If they can smell it for sure. But because
some people like they'll memorize it.

1363
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:29,040
Let's say if it's a speed,
obviously depends on the
context. Totally. But you know,

1364
01:23:29,050 --> 01:23:32,740
if it's a speech or a lecture or a
presentation that somebody get giving that

1365
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:37,741
they always give and you know when they
talk about this Xyz exciting part or you

1366
01:23:39,221 --> 01:23:43,210
know, important part, they've
done it literally 10,000 times.

1367
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:45,790
So they're not going to
convey natural excitement.

1368
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:49,210
They have to sort of manufacture it
for the crowd kind of thing. And Yeah,

1369
01:23:49,211 --> 01:23:50,230
if that,
you know,

1370
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:55,380
manufactured excitement comes off as
manufacturer to the cards yet that'll jam

1371
01:23:55,611 --> 01:23:57,200
yet Jim, your whole thing up. Yeah.

1372
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:02,310
And I think that's why you have to be
talking about something that you know

1373
01:24:02,681 --> 01:24:05,680
about his part one and part two,

1374
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,200
you have to be talking about
something that you care about.

1375
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:12,400
If we don't care about you don't want
to hear me stand up and talk about

1376
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:18,220
something, you know, some
whatever. You don't want it.

1377
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:22,520
You don't want to hear me talk
about candle making sure. Right.

1378
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:26,050
Cause I don't care about candle making.
In fact, I don't really like candles.

1379
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:33,430
All right. I'm just being honest here. I
respect your opinion. Don't like candles.

1380
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:37,620
Why would you have candles?
It's 2019 right?

1381
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:42,370
Right. Well, there's many different
reasons for Kendall's. But yeah,

1382
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:47,020
mood lighting. Uh, you know, my
point is I don't like candles.

1383
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:48,280
You don't wanna hear
me talk about candles.

1384
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:50,740
You don't hear me talk
about the construction of
candles because I don't care

1385
01:24:50,741 --> 01:24:55,741
about it and I'm not going to give a
very passionate talk about candles.

1386
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:58,060
Even if I studied the subject matter.

1387
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:02,230
If you hear me talking about leadership,

1388
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:07,770
you can't harness the enthusiasm that
I have for talking about leadership.

1389
01:25:08,921 --> 01:25:12,790
You can't, you can't hold it back. It's
coming out unbridled. It's unbridled.

1390
01:25:12,791 --> 01:25:15,100
It's coming out because
I really care about this.

1391
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,110
You know what I'm talking to a
bunch of people that are leaders.

1392
01:25:17,260 --> 01:25:19,600
I want them to win.
I want them to learn.

1393
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,510
I want them to absorb what I'm saying
cause I know it can be helpful to them

1394
01:25:22,511 --> 01:25:24,610
cause I've seen it be helpful
to thousands of people.

1395
01:25:24,611 --> 01:25:28,210
So I want them to get the message and
so it's going to come out that way.

1396
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:32,500
So I know what I'm talking about.
I believe what I'm talking about,

1397
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:37,710
what I am talking about and I care
about what I am talking about.

1398
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:40,810
And if you're talking to people,

1399
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,600
try and talk about things
that you know about,

1400
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,580
that you care about and that you believe
in. And if you do that as a leader,

1401
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:52,450
when you're giving direction
and its direction that you
believe in its direction,

1402
01:25:52,451 --> 01:25:55,480
that you care about the outcome and its
direction that you know and understand

1403
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,680
you are going to come across
like a confident leader
and people are gonna listen

1404
01:25:59,681 --> 01:26:03,170
to you. If you're failing
in those categories, it's
going to be harder for you.

1405
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:14,770
This is interesting continuing on and we
just went on a little riff right there.

1406
01:26:14,771 --> 01:26:19,720
But a leader is actually
giving conflicting orders
if he is uncertain manner,

1407
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:24,340
hints that he does not expect obedience
or that he thinks he may not be obeyed.

1408
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:27,070
So even if you stand
up and you say it you,

1409
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,080
you can be give conflicting
orders if you just don't,

1410
01:26:29,081 --> 01:26:30,910
if you just look like you're
unsure of what you're doing,

1411
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:37,540
although it is possible for the new leader
who has lacked experience to imitate

1412
01:26:37,541 --> 01:26:40,330
the manner and tone of
wiser leaders around him,

1413
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:43,900
only practice in command develops
the appropriate manner and tone.

1414
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:48,190
And I would go further to say it's not
just about practice and you don't want to

1415
01:26:48,191 --> 01:26:49,001
become a good actor.

1416
01:26:49,001 --> 01:26:50,650
What you want to do is you want
to believe in what you're saying.

1417
01:26:50,651 --> 01:26:52,660
You want to care about what you think
would have no, no, but what you're saying

1418
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:59,140
next, lack of a confident manner
inevitably interferes with command.

1419
01:27:00,370 --> 01:27:01,560
So also ma'am,

1420
01:27:01,561 --> 01:27:06,561
manner that portrays indecision for men
respond to the signs of indecision by

1421
01:27:06,611 --> 01:27:08,530
withholding or delaying action.

1422
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:12,970
The rule is that a leader should make
up his mind and arrive at that decision

1423
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,100
before he gives orders.

1424
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:17,330
Okay?

1425
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:18,230
Very obvious,

1426
01:27:18,231 --> 01:27:23,060
but not so obvious because people
screw it up when he confronts his man.

1427
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:26,990
He must be ready to commit himself to
this course or that men will accept

1428
01:27:26,991 --> 01:27:31,700
assurance for competence and they do
not want competence and they do want

1429
01:27:31,701 --> 01:27:34,940
competence and leader. Now I, this
is again, this is a situation where I

1430
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,810
men will accept assurance for competence.

1431
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:43,180
That's not readily true
because just because you're,

1432
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,630
if you're sure of yourself,

1433
01:27:44,631 --> 01:27:47,660
the only way you're going to be sure
of yourself is if you are competent.

1434
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:51,740
Unless you're one of these small fractions
of people that are conmen, right?

1435
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,160
Con Man that can be late,

1436
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:57,050
the swollen gonna do everyone
like that's you're a con man.

1437
01:27:57,051 --> 01:27:58,070
If you're really good at that,

1438
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:00,650
it can be aligned to people and telling
them something that you don't believe in,

1439
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:05,930
fine. It'll work. Sometimes
if you're great at it might
work more often than that.

1440
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,900
If you're a normal person and you
want to be a really good leader,

1441
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:14,080
you shouldn't be just
using your confidence to
overcome the fact that you're

1442
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,610
don't believe in what you're doing and
it's going to be really hard to do.

1443
01:28:16,611 --> 01:28:18,490
That is really hard to get.

1444
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:22,960
People have really good lie
detectors in their minds. Hmm.

1445
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:26,343
Okay.

1446
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,940
This is a great section.

1447
01:28:28,090 --> 01:28:33,090
What soldiers think of leaders for the
first time in the history of armies.

1448
01:28:33,131 --> 01:28:36,550
The army of the United States has
undertaken to find out what its enlisted

1449
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:39,520
personnel. Think about a large number
of things important to the army.

1450
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,390
Some thousands of soldiers have been
interviewed at length and one of the

1451
01:28:43,391 --> 01:28:46,780
subjects about which they were
questioned his army leadership,

1452
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:51,610
what the soldiers said makes it very
clear that the quality of leadership in an

1453
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:56,290
army is the most important single
determiner of morale and performance.

1454
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,170
Did everyone just hear that?

1455
01:28:59,410 --> 01:29:04,410
What soldiers said makes it very clear
that the quality of leadership in an army

1456
01:29:06,270 --> 01:29:11,270
is the most important single
determiner of morale and performance.

1457
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:13,210
Okay.

1458
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,550
What do we say now at echelon front,

1459
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:17,500
we say leadership is the most
important thing on the battlefield.

1460
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:23,730
I luckily don't have to pay the writer
of this book to say that cause that's the

1461
01:29:23,921 --> 01:29:24,754
same thing.

1462
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:29,680
Leadership is the most important thing
on the battlefield is the single most

1463
01:29:29,710 --> 01:29:33,040
important determinant of
morale and performance.

1464
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:37,060
Continuing on the relationship
between men and officers,

1465
01:29:37,061 --> 01:29:41,800
commissioned and noncommissioned
determines the fighting
spirit of an army quite

1466
01:29:41,801 --> 01:29:44,800
as much as the ability of the
soldiers to take training does.

1467
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:47,681
In fact,

1468
01:29:47,681 --> 01:29:52,510
it turns out that these human relations
are much more important to morale than

1469
01:29:52,511 --> 01:29:55,720
beef, steak, warm socks, ballgames,

1470
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:59,260
and Vaudeville shows or what
the men believe about the war.

1471
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,400
What they think.

1472
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:09,960
The relationship that you have with your
people is more important than all these

1473
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:13,530
other things. It's more important than
their actual belief in what they're doing.

1474
01:30:15,330 --> 01:30:17,340
More important than
their belief in the war.

1475
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:21,870
Continue on among the hundred and 50 so
items covered in in, in, in the interview.

1476
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:26,790
77 proof to be definitely associated
with morale and of the 20 most closely

1477
01:30:26,791 --> 01:30:31,440
related to morale. 16 have to do
with man to officer relations,

1478
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:37,670
what the men think of their leaders is
then of utmost importance to the army and

1479
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:41,040
to the successful prosecution of the war.

1480
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:47,270
Roughly in order of their association
with good leadership in the minds of the

1481
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:50,970
enlisted men are the following points.
Three,

1482
01:30:50,971 --> 01:30:55,350
here's what makes a
good leader one ability.

1483
01:30:56,820 --> 01:30:58,500
Competence comes first.

1484
01:30:58,770 --> 01:31:03,770
The good officer must know his stuff for
on this depends the confidence in his

1485
01:31:03,991 --> 01:31:04,824
leadership.

1486
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:06,803
Boom

1487
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:13,660
and interestingly that is
proof of what I just said,

1488
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:17,800
that if you don't believe in what you're
doing, you don't know what you're doing,

1489
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:21,130
everyone's going to sense it.
So competence number one.

1490
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:26,280
Number two next to the ability next to
ability is interested in the welfare of

1491
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:28,654
the soldier.

1492
01:31:29,110 --> 01:31:33,760
The officer who can be trusted to help
the soldier in time of need or who would

1493
01:31:33,761 --> 01:31:38,190
be accessible for personal advice
is a good officer. So you've gotta,

1494
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:41,230
you gotta be caring about your men.
Number three,

1495
01:31:41,231 --> 01:31:46,060
promptness in making decisions is next.
Number four,

1496
01:31:46,150 --> 01:31:50,230
good teacher or instructor follows the
leader who has the patience and the

1497
01:31:50,231 --> 01:31:54,030
ability to make things clear,
to get men under him. Dope.

1498
01:31:54,070 --> 01:31:58,600
To get to make things clear to the men
under him is valued for that reason.

1499
01:31:58,601 --> 01:32:03,190
So you've got gotta be good teacher.
Number five, judgment, common sense,

1500
01:32:03,191 --> 01:32:04,810
and the ability to get things done,

1501
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:09,610
follow in next judgment and common sense.

1502
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:14,800
Isn't it an interesting common sense?
You know what we want,

1503
01:32:14,801 --> 01:32:19,210
even once you have some common sense
and that horribly,

1504
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:23,080
a cliched saying of common sense
sometimes isn't very common.

1505
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,160
And it's a cliche because it's true.
Yes.

1506
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:32,080
How many times I've been sitting in
a big meeting, you know what I mean?

1507
01:32:32,081 --> 01:32:32,914
Here in the city

1508
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:37,650
thing that was so obvious.
So it's just such common sense.

1509
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,840
And had people

1510
01:32:40,580 --> 01:32:43,280
kind of jaw drop at
this amazing statement,

1511
01:32:43,281 --> 01:32:47,330
which was completely obvious cause
sometimes common sense isn't too common.

1512
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:51,350
It's only common to you.
It's like relative, you know?

1513
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,980
That's why it's never like
an shouldn't say never,

1514
01:32:54,981 --> 01:32:59,570
but it's not that good of an an idea
generally threatened to be like it's

1515
01:32:59,571 --> 01:33:03,380
Commons or MB like mad at someone for not
knowing quote unquote common sense. No,

1516
01:33:03,381 --> 01:33:05,240
it's not good and it's not good when you,

1517
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:10,390
when you make a statement that is
common sense to say it condescendingly

1518
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:11,960
like this is just common sense.

1519
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:15,770
Everyone you need to do this and
then everyone already is mad at you.

1520
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,510
They're resentful of you yet just
from the tone alone, the tone alone.

1521
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:23,570
Then on top of that dimension you've
got your arms crossed and you're shaking

1522
01:33:23,690 --> 01:33:28,500
hand Sarah Armstrong verbal cue cues.
Just,

1523
01:33:28,630 --> 01:33:29,060
yeah,

1524
01:33:29,060 --> 01:33:33,710
Mensa because common sense in California
is different than common sense in

1525
01:33:33,711 --> 01:33:37,940
Texas. Some of it possibly. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1526
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:40,610
Common Sense in Texas is different than
California. I'll tell you. It's true.

1527
01:33:40,611 --> 01:33:44,270
That's a good point. You are
correct. So you can, yeah,

1528
01:33:44,271 --> 01:33:46,700
the number's going to be on you
when you start doing that stuff.

1529
01:33:46,701 --> 01:33:48,110
The condescending deal.

1530
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:51,800
Here we go.
Number six,

1531
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:55,970
the good leader does not boss you around
when there is no good reason for it.

1532
01:33:56,730 --> 01:34:00,470
Soldiers dislike an officer
who throws his rank around,

1533
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:02,660
who test his own authority continually.

1534
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,720
They sense that he is not sure of himself.

1535
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:09,720
Let that one sink in.

1536
01:34:10,740 --> 01:34:15,630
If you're bossing people around using
your rank to make things happen,

1537
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:20,890
you're people don't like you. Yeah.
And there's someone that says,

1538
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,910
I'm not here for my people to
like you like me. You're wrong.

1539
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:24,990
If your people don't like you,

1540
01:34:24,991 --> 01:34:28,290
they will not perform as well as people
that do like you. And you're the leader.

1541
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:29,011
Number seven,

1542
01:34:29,011 --> 01:34:33,210
the man who tells you when you have done
a good job rates well as a good leader.

1543
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:37,800
Failure in commendation is a common
complaint among men in the ranks.

1544
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:42,060
The best incentive to good work is the
prospect that it will be noticed and

1545
01:34:42,061 --> 01:34:45,860
remembered by the leader
solid

1546
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,730
next. And um, that's something I
don't do a lot of. I'm not like, okay,

1547
01:34:52,731 --> 01:34:57,020
good job buddy. But I will say that when
I do tell someone they did a good job,

1548
01:34:57,260 --> 01:35:00,380
they know that I mean it. They're usually
pretty fired up that I said it to him.

1549
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:05,660
Yeah, I would agree
with that. Number Eight,

1550
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:09,770
physical strength and good build.
Come next.

1551
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:12,770
You're nodding your head over there.
Echo Charles.

1552
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:17,930
I Agree Jack. I mean, okay so

1553
01:35:20,210 --> 01:35:25,210
at risk of sounding like maybe
disparaging any one in particular,

1554
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:26,810
any type person in particular,

1555
01:35:26,811 --> 01:35:30,370
but I'm just saying this is like
factually so you ever watch it like a self

1556
01:35:30,371 --> 01:35:34,610
defense video? Yes. And no matter what,

1557
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:37,280
yes I fall a mic go Joe life

1558
01:35:39,980 --> 01:35:43,670
LR and Joe Rogan repost those
mic Dojo life things. But yeah,

1559
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:45,920
there's all kinds of weird self defense
things and I know where you're going

1560
01:35:45,921 --> 01:35:49,880
with this. Yes. So
physical self defense guy,

1561
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,150
he doesn't look like he could what?

1562
01:35:51,230 --> 01:35:54,050
Make it up a flight of stairs
and you're thinking, Bro,

1563
01:35:54,051 --> 01:35:57,720
I'm not going to listen to anything that
you say. Right. Which detective Lee,

1564
01:35:57,890 --> 01:36:01,580
his physique does not prove the
effectiveness of his, his tenant is true.

1565
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:02,563
It doesn't.

1566
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:05,600
But what about when he's got the sign
hanging up in the background that says

1567
01:36:06,140 --> 01:36:09,680
honor, strength and discipline
and only discipline.

1568
01:36:09,681 --> 01:36:13,460
He has put in putting away that
quarter pounders with cheese daily

1569
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:19,250
and that that's, that's the
point, you know, so it's
like bright. It is something,

1570
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:23,930
and I, again, I don't want to disparage
anyone system or whatever, but yeah man,

1571
01:36:24,020 --> 01:36:28,490
if I'm a soldier or a listener or a
follower and I'm going to do first

1572
01:36:28,491 --> 01:36:29,181
impression,
right?

1573
01:36:29,181 --> 01:36:31,490
I come up to you and you're going to
teach me something and you're like,

1574
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:34,580
oh sloppy, you're a sloppy person. I'll
tell you. That's at the very least,

1575
01:36:34,581 --> 01:36:36,230
that's a strike against.
There's no doubt about it.

1576
01:36:36,231 --> 01:36:40,880
And they're just just even me and
Ramadi and telling all my guys,

1577
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:43,490
hey you will wear a square to wear
uniform because first impressions mean

1578
01:36:43,491 --> 01:36:44,324
something.

1579
01:36:44,390 --> 01:36:48,170
And so if somebody shows up
to be in charge of you and
they can't take charge of

1580
01:36:48,171 --> 01:36:52,280
their own health, it's an indicator
that maybe they got some other issues.

1581
01:36:52,281 --> 01:36:53,120
Especially,

1582
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:58,490
I mean then this is clearly directed at
people that are in the military because

1583
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:01,190
military is a physical job.
Re pretty much,

1584
01:37:01,191 --> 01:37:02,720
regardless of what you're
doing in the military,

1585
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:07,900
you have to have some physical capability
to put on a rucksack and go and walk

1586
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:09,410
for a long period of time.

1587
01:37:09,860 --> 01:37:13,010
You've gotta be able to do these
certain physical activities.

1588
01:37:13,011 --> 01:37:15,470
And if it's apparent from looking
at you that you can't do that,

1589
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:19,490
respect is going down. And by the way,
this isn't, this isn't me talking,

1590
01:37:19,491 --> 01:37:20,390
this isn't you talking.

1591
01:37:20,391 --> 01:37:24,230
This is what these thousands of soldiers
that filled out this survey said, hey,

1592
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:27,890
physical strength and good build,
come next. That's what's respected.

1593
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,920
And it's definitely not mandatory because
I mean, Napoleon was like a tiny guy,

1594
01:37:33,950 --> 01:37:38,360
right? So it's not a mandatory thing, but

1595
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:44,750
don't be out of shape. I can tell
you that. Yeah, get in shape.

1596
01:37:44,930 --> 01:37:48,290
Hey, get in shape. How's that? If
you're not in shape, get in shape.

1597
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,820
It'll be better for you as a leader.

1598
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:51,880
It will be better for
you as a human being it.

1599
01:37:51,881 --> 01:37:56,850
It'll help everything that you're
doing. So do it. Number nine,

1600
01:37:56,940 --> 01:38:00,900
good education,
sense of humor and guts or courage.

1601
01:38:02,340 --> 01:38:04,440
Number 10 impartiality is next.

1602
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:09,210
Leaders who do not save the dirty jobs
for fellows. They don't like our valued.

1603
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:13,500
The good leader is fair to all
in his command, so be fair.

1604
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:16,180
Common Sense,
which I guess isn't too

1605
01:38:17,710 --> 01:38:22,710
net next and an importance is industry
leaders who do as little work as they can

1606
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:26,780
get away with are not respected
by the enlisted men. Yeah,

1607
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:32,660
don't be standing around with your hands
in your pockets cause to home do that.

1608
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:40,010
12 when an officer gives orders in such
a way that you clearly know what to do

1609
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,610
is a mark of merit as a leader.

1610
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:49,200
Soldiers also like an officer
with a clear strong voice.

1611
01:38:50,970 --> 01:38:54,030
There you go.
That makes sense.

1612
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,920
The remaining qualities which the soldiers
mentioned came toward the bottom of

1613
01:38:58,921 --> 01:38:59,281
the list.

1614
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:03,150
They are undoubtedly related to good
leadership but they are less important.

1615
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:05,730
Not Hot tempered.

1616
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:11,700
Do not drive you too hard.
Keep promises.

1617
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,850
The kind of fellows you
could have a good time with,

1618
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:20,160
not too proud of their rank
are all characteristics
which some men want in their

1619
01:39:20,161 --> 01:39:22,410
leaders, but there is no
general agreement about them.

1620
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:26,490
Many leaders are considered good in
spite of failures on these parts.

1621
01:39:27,780 --> 01:39:32,780
The chief things a man wants from a
leader are thus competence and interest in

1622
01:39:33,391 --> 01:39:34,224
his welfare.

1623
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,590
The orders of a man who does not know
his stuff cannot be dependent on,

1624
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:39,960
they are subject to change and countermand

1625
01:39:41,670 --> 01:39:45,600
an incompetent leader teaches caution
and hesitation and following his lead,

1626
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:49,350
he becomes a signal for lack of
action on the part of the soldier.

1627
01:39:50,570 --> 01:39:55,350
Indecision in a leader has the same
effect on a soldier as ignorance has no

1628
01:39:55,351 --> 01:39:57,510
soldier can follow.
A leader who's uncertain,

1629
01:39:57,511 --> 01:40:01,950
which way to turn the essential quality
of any leaders to take lead and show the

1630
01:40:01,951 --> 01:40:05,280
direction quickly, clearly,
emphatically, and with enthusiasm.

1631
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:09,960
Without these qualities, a man is not
even a good leader for his hunting dog.

1632
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:14,670
Now the interesting thing
about that is there's a,

1633
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:18,990
there's a little dichotomy that
reveals itself. It's like, okay,

1634
01:40:18,991 --> 01:40:22,380
you gotta be decisive and
give direction quickly,

1635
01:40:22,381 --> 01:40:24,900
clearly and emphatically that
that's great. That sounds good.

1636
01:40:25,230 --> 01:40:28,410
What happens if you're not sure what
happens if you're truly not sure which

1637
01:40:28,411 --> 01:40:32,580
direction to go?
Then what you do is you say hold up

1638
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:37,650
former perimeter where we got
to get a resection on the map.

1639
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:41,040
That is so much better than saying,
all right,

1640
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:43,650
well we're going to push a little further.
You know what I mean?

1641
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:47,670
Like I'm not really sure where we are
and hold on and wait. If you just go,

1642
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:49,170
hey look,
we're a little turned around right now.

1643
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:51,450
We're need to recouple resections
where to check the GPS,

1644
01:40:51,451 --> 01:40:53,830
whatever we're going to do,
when to find out where we're on the,

1645
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,150
we're gonna move forward to take five.

1646
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:59,740
It never goes uncle Jack has got this
under wraps were good technically that is

1647
01:40:59,741 --> 01:41:01,990
being decisive. It is being decisive. Yes,

1648
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:06,991
you can be decisive in intro in trying
to uncover what the next move is going to

1649
01:41:07,421 --> 01:41:08,254
be cause you're not sure,

1650
01:41:08,260 --> 01:41:13,030
but sometimes people try and you know bs
their way through a scenario like that

1651
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:15,790
and that again, you're, you're,

1652
01:41:15,940 --> 01:41:19,090
you don't know what you're doing and
you're proving that so it's best to be

1653
01:41:19,091 --> 01:41:21,400
truthful and say, hey look,
we're turned around right now.

1654
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,700
We're going to form a perimeter,
we're going to cut a resection,

1655
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:26,290
we're going to find out where we
are and then we're going to move.

1656
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:31,210
You got 10 minutes. Boom. Everyone
was okay. Cool. Good Times.

1657
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:36,010
So those,
that is a great list of what,

1658
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:41,940
what people look for from leaders and
sure it's directed at the military,

1659
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:48,060
but almost every single one of those
is equally applicable to any leadership

1660
01:41:49,181 --> 01:41:53,620
position. Next, the role of the soldier,
part of what makes a man a good soldier,

1661
01:41:53,621 --> 01:41:56,230
his own, his, his own
adoption of the soldiers role.

1662
01:41:56,231 --> 01:41:59,140
He comes to think and speak
of himself as a soldier.

1663
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:04,630
What a man thinks of himself affects
his behavior. The rail straightener,

1664
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:09,910
which is the skilled worker who runs the
machine that straightens railroad rails

1665
01:42:10,270 --> 01:42:11,410
is one man.

1666
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,730
When he thinks of himself with
pride as a rail straightener,

1667
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:21,600
he becomes another when he begins as he
made to regard himself as a mere wage

1668
01:42:21,821 --> 01:42:26,650
slave. The rail straightener takes
pride in his work, does a good job,

1669
01:42:26,740 --> 01:42:31,740
is happy the wage slave let's crooked
rails get by because he doesn't care the

1670
01:42:33,961 --> 01:42:38,140
same way the soldier who thinks proudly
of himself as a soldier is doing a

1671
01:42:38,141 --> 01:42:42,070
service to both himself and the army.
How smart is that?

1672
01:42:42,120 --> 01:42:43,540
That is very good.
Yeah.

1673
01:42:43,730 --> 01:42:48,100
So it's like you're kind of
introducing a sense of identity, right?

1674
01:42:48,101 --> 01:42:51,270
And they like their job, like this is
what you do and people will do that.

1675
01:42:51,320 --> 01:42:54,730
You know, the for themselves,
you know, I'm a whatever.

1676
01:42:55,690 --> 01:42:58,990
I remember some time,
this is actually quite a while ago,

1677
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:03,991
somebody posted a picture of a very
intricate plumbing job and it was like 8

1678
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:08,740
million copper pipes and perfectly
spaced coming in. And I was like,

1679
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:12,780
this dude is proud to be a plumber
and it's lunch shows budget.

1680
01:43:13,630 --> 01:43:17,560
So yes,
if you are in a job,

1681
01:43:17,800 --> 01:43:22,000
get into the job, right.
And let me tell you this,

1682
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:25,090
if you're not into the job and
you want to get out of the job,

1683
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:29,470
the best way for you to get out of the
job is by getting into the job you're

1684
01:43:29,471 --> 01:43:31,900
doing something that you don't care about,
care about it.

1685
01:43:32,110 --> 01:43:35,020
Because otherwise people look at you.
Why would I promote you? You can't even,

1686
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:36,760
you can't even dig this ditch correctly.

1687
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:38,830
If you're out there digging
that ditch like you,

1688
01:43:38,890 --> 01:43:41,860
like you mean it like you'd make trying
to make a perfect dish in the world.

1689
01:43:42,670 --> 01:43:44,650
Do it.
Yeah.

1690
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:49,990
Certain forms of punishment
published just public disgrace,

1691
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:53,900
ridicule all the role of the soldier and
may lessen or destroy his usefulness to

1692
01:43:53,901 --> 01:43:54,820
the army and his,
uh,

1693
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:58,910
amenability to leadership
the noncommissioned or
commission officer who rides

1694
01:43:58,911 --> 01:44:02,480
one of his men in such a manner as to
make him doubt his own value as a soldier

1695
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:05,000
is shattering the man's best
motive for good performance.

1696
01:44:05,330 --> 01:44:08,960
The senior leader who reprimands a
junior in the presence of his man reduces

1697
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:10,640
that junior's value to the army.

1698
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,760
Almost never good to the little
someone in front of the team.

1699
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:19,531
Good leadership.

1700
01:44:19,531 --> 01:44:23,940
On the other hand causes men to build
up each for himself a particular role,

1701
01:44:24,030 --> 01:44:24,870
a specialty.

1702
01:44:25,380 --> 01:44:29,790
It means a great deal to a man to take
pride in being a soldier into being a

1703
01:44:29,791 --> 01:44:33,990
sharp shooter, an aviation mechanic, a
truck driver, a cook or a radio operator.

1704
01:44:34,230 --> 01:44:37,230
Competent leaders criticize a,
a poor piece of work.

1705
01:44:37,231 --> 01:44:41,820
Condemn a mistake but never take but
take care of to never make a soldier feel

1706
01:44:41,821 --> 01:44:44,010
he is a failure at his job.

1707
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,400
So you can criticize the mistake that
they made but don't criticize their, uh,

1708
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:52,140
their ability in that job.

1709
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:57,120
When a soldier begins to regard himself
as being part of his unit and when his

1710
01:44:57,121 --> 01:44:59,340
job has become part of his role,

1711
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,760
then teamwork has enormously improved.

1712
01:45:02,910 --> 01:45:07,770
The soldier who thinks of himself as only
a private temporarily on this or that

1713
01:45:07,771 --> 01:45:11,160
assignment is a different man from
the soldier who thinks of himself as a

1714
01:45:11,161 --> 01:45:13,560
necessary member of his outfit.

1715
01:45:15,980 --> 01:45:20,660
Good information. And here's how
we get to selection of leaders.

1716
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:26,150
Rank is no guarantee of the ability
to judge leadership in others,

1717
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:30,110
nor are good leaders necessarily competent
to assess good leadership and others.

1718
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:35,680
The test of competent judge is his
successful predictions in the past.

1719
01:45:36,790 --> 01:45:37,200
Okay,

1720
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,000
so you might be the highest ranking guy,

1721
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:41,220
but that doesn't mean you can necessarily
figure out who's going to be a good

1722
01:45:41,221 --> 01:45:45,690
leader unless you show repetitively
that you can select good leaders.

1723
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,520
The interview itself is not a fair
or accurate test of the soldier,

1724
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:53,100
the man who would make a good leader,

1725
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:57,210
maybe a modest man who fails in an
interview to exhibit those qualities that

1726
01:45:57,211 --> 01:45:59,580
would make his men believe in him,
trust him,

1727
01:45:59,581 --> 01:46:03,590
and admire him and the man who could
never secure the loyalty of serve

1728
01:46:03,660 --> 01:46:08,660
subordinates may nevertheless be by
assurance and poise by voice and manner,

1729
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:11,940
mislead inexperienced
judges as to his capacity.

1730
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:15,630
So all the time I get asked, what
should we, how should I interview?

1731
01:46:15,631 --> 01:46:18,850
What should I ask?
You can only figure out so much fruit.

1732
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,850
And when I get asked
that, I always say, okay,

1733
01:46:20,851 --> 01:46:24,090
who in here thought they were hiring
the best guy that they've ever hired?

1734
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:26,550
And he turned out to be a loser
and everyone raises their hand.

1735
01:46:26,690 --> 01:46:29,220
And how many times have you taken a
chance on someone that you weren't sure if

1736
01:46:29,221 --> 01:46:30,900
they're going to work out and
they turned out to be a stud?

1737
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,060
Everyone raises their hand.
Yeah.

1738
01:46:32,170 --> 01:46:35,670
It's really hard to judge who's
going to work well and who's not.

1739
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,330
And that kind of goes for like
friends too. You know, like they're,

1740
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:41,810
I mean man that happens all the time
where you meet someone and you just know

1741
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:43,110
you don't really feel them that much,

1742
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:45,840
but they end up being your best friend
or something like that like years later

1743
01:46:45,841 --> 01:46:50,790
or something like that. It's
weird like that, like situations,

1744
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:53,430
even certain first impressions,
you know,

1745
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:57,330
that that are like they don't indicate
the long haul, you know? Yeah,

1746
01:46:58,270 --> 01:46:59,103
yeah.

1747
01:47:00,510 --> 01:47:04,140
It takes a little bit time to uncover
what people are real about really about in

1748
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:08,280
many cases I can tell you like I feel
pretty good about judging people. Yeah.

1749
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:12,000
And I'm probably like 70% accurate,
you know? So that's not a great,

1750
01:47:12,150 --> 01:47:16,840
like I feel pretty good about it, but
I know that I'm only battened 70% yeah.

1751
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:18,780
Which is like a c,
but the,

1752
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:22,380
I wonder if in do you think this,

1753
01:47:22,381 --> 01:47:27,240
do you think that there's certain things
that are maybe even subconscious about

1754
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:30,540
people that you can sorta tell after
just talking to him for a second,

1755
01:47:30,570 --> 01:47:34,010
whether it be like for sure they react to,
I'm going to ask,

1756
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:39,450
this just popped up my mind. I got
asked, I was at a event and it wasn't,

1757
01:47:39,690 --> 01:47:41,910
it was interesting about it.
It wasn't with a specific company,

1758
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:45,740
which normally are working with a company
and I was just at an event where I'm

1759
01:47:45,741 --> 01:47:49,890
speaking to multiple different companies
and this woman stood up to ask a

1760
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:53,730
question and as soon as
she stood up I was like,

1761
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:55,990
this is going to be she,

1762
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:58,290
she does not want to hear my
answer no matter what I say.

1763
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:03,530
But she just stood up with just
arrogance dripping off her and,

1764
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:08,340
and just, I was like, well, she's not
gonna. She's not gonna like this answer.

1765
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:12,870
Whatever answer I give, whatever
question she asks, she is not,

1766
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,790
she's not listening.
So that,

1767
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:18,940
that thought that you had right
there when it comes correct? Yeah,

1768
01:48:18,941 --> 01:48:23,941
it was basically when she stood up
and then three words out of her mouth,

1769
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:28,030
I was like, for real here.
I was like, yeah. And,

1770
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:31,800
and it's also interesting
because you know, she just,

1771
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:34,620
when you're working with a single company,

1772
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:37,770
they're all kind of on board and
they're all kind of like, they're,

1773
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:39,900
maybe they're not on board
with what you're saying,

1774
01:48:39,901 --> 01:48:43,940
but they're unified as a group trying
to move in a certain direction.

1775
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:48,330
So we have a random group of people and
the woman stands up and I could tell

1776
01:48:48,331 --> 01:48:51,510
right away, yep, she's got it.
She does. She, there's no answer.

1777
01:48:51,511 --> 01:48:54,090
I'm going to give her, that's going to
make her happy. What did it feel like?

1778
01:48:54,091 --> 01:48:55,490
It was like subconscious,

1779
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:58,710
like what's it like or where
you like see the visual cues?

1780
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:02,590
It was visual cues and then
the opening of the question,

1781
01:49:02,591 --> 01:49:06,180
and I can't remember what it was,
but it was like, Oh yes, confirmed,

1782
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:10,050
let me tell you. So it was one of
those, it was one of those, you know,

1783
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:14,650
and so what I did was I preempted my
answer and I said, you're, you know,

1784
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:16,950
cause then she asked
a question and I said,

1785
01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:20,310
you're actually not going to
like my answer to this question,

1786
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:24,930
but I'm just going to tell you what I've
seen. And I appreciate the question.

1787
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:27,900
And then I answered the question.
And of course she didn't like the answer.

1788
01:49:28,470 --> 01:49:32,490
You don't know why she didn't like
the answer because the answer was the

1789
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:33,630
leadership question.

1790
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:36,180
And the problem with the people that
you're having is not a problem with the

1791
01:49:36,181 --> 01:49:37,980
people that you have.
It's a problem with you,

1792
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:41,310
which is the way it is with
all leadership problems.

1793
01:49:41,311 --> 01:49:42,990
When you have a problem with your team,

1794
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:47,070
your team isn't performing the way you
want them to do. It's, it's, it's, oh,

1795
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:50,890
they're lazy. Oh, they don't
do the mission correctly.
Well, whose fault is that?

1796
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:53,770
You're the leader.
You're the leader in charge of the people.

1797
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:57,460
So if they're not doing the mission that
you want them to execute it or how you

1798
01:49:57,461 --> 01:50:01,510
want them execute it, you can't blame
them. They literally work for you.

1799
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:05,670
You are the boss of them.
So let's list, look,

1800
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:09,790
do you want to explain to me how you give
them the direction you want to talk to

1801
01:50:09,791 --> 01:50:13,240
me about like what,
what sort of direction you give them,

1802
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:17,020
how you communicate with them. And
we went down that road, you know,

1803
01:50:17,021 --> 01:50:21,400
but at the end of the
day she sat down with no,

1804
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:23,590
she took nothing.
I said onboard zero.

1805
01:50:23,990 --> 01:50:28,090
And this is a fairly rare occasion,
you know, that's why I remember,

1806
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:31,060
this was a couple of years ago, but
I remember it because I thought, Yup,

1807
01:50:31,061 --> 01:50:33,040
she didn't. She's, when
she stood up, I set up,

1808
01:50:33,041 --> 01:50:37,180
she's not listening to me and then
she's not gonna like my answer.

1809
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:40,600
And then when she sat down I said, Yup,
she's going to walk out of here and go,

1810
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:43,120
that guy didn't know what he was
talking about. This, it's not my,

1811
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,570
it's not my problem that my team
is all jacked up. It's not my,

1812
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:48,460
it's not my fault that my team is lazy.

1813
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:54,010
One of her key components of her statement
was that her team was lazy and they

1814
01:50:55,481 --> 01:51:00,060
weren't meeting the standards. And the
answer to that question isn't, you know,

1815
01:51:00,070 --> 01:51:02,230
beat them harder cause that doesn't work.

1816
01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:07,410
The answer that question is you as a
leader are not doing a good job of leading

1817
01:51:07,721 --> 01:51:12,610
them or there is a chance that your team
is completely incompetent and you need

1818
01:51:12,611 --> 01:51:15,700
to train them or get rid of them.
Guess what?

1819
01:51:15,701 --> 01:51:18,940
Both of those things are your
responsibility. You're the leader.

1820
01:51:18,941 --> 01:51:20,830
You need to train them or
you need to get rid of them.

1821
01:51:21,490 --> 01:51:25,090
So worse answering the
world isn't the best.

1822
01:51:25,270 --> 01:51:29,080
It's the worst dancer in the world. It
hurts, you know, life talks about this,

1823
01:51:29,110 --> 01:51:33,220
Dave talks about like when he was like,
when he's writing,

1824
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,140
no bad teams,
only bad leaders.

1825
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:39,670
He's literally thinking about things that
he did where he was blaming his team,

1826
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:42,340
you know, and he's just looking
and he's looking back on here.

1827
01:51:42,341 --> 01:51:46,360
I was blaming my team and in none
of it was my fault. And that's,

1828
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:48,250
that's the revelation that you have.

1829
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:54,040
I've seen literally witnessed this and
like a bunch of times too where people

1830
01:51:54,041 --> 01:51:54,910
would stand up,

1831
01:51:54,911 --> 01:51:59,830
which with what I thought was sort of
that sort of feel that tone, like, oh,

1832
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,840
like they're gonna,
they're just gonna Stump.

1833
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:04,990
You Miss [inaudible] mister know
it all, you know, kind of attitude.

1834
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:10,300
And you tell him that answer. Like it's
like, hey, it's your responsibility.

1835
01:52:10,301 --> 01:52:10,601
You know?

1836
01:52:10,601 --> 01:52:15,280
And then I can see their mind just
totally changing you and they accept it.

1837
01:52:15,281 --> 01:52:18,370
And actually going back to this woman,
when I was talking to this woman,

1838
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:24,120
I immediately tried to like frame it in
the most humble way to not offend her

1839
01:52:25,301 --> 01:52:27,460
ego. You know, when I told
them, when I told her, you know,

1840
01:52:27,461 --> 01:52:29,560
you're not going to like the answer I
give you. I didn't say it like that.

1841
01:52:29,561 --> 01:52:32,020
I was like, look, I'm going
to give you an answer that I,

1842
01:52:32,210 --> 01:52:34,300
I got a feeling you're probably
not even gonna like this answer,

1843
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:37,360
but I just going to tell you
kind of what I've seen, you know?

1844
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:42,360
So I tried to do my best to
not hit her ego in the face.

1845
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:48,960
The problem was her ego was big and
strong and dug in and leading the way

1846
01:52:49,550 --> 01:52:53,450
leading out front. And
so it was, you know,

1847
01:52:53,451 --> 01:52:55,730
and that always bums me out and it
doesn't happen very often. Like I said,

1848
01:52:55,731 --> 01:52:58,610
I mean this is two years ago or something
like that and I'm remembering this

1849
01:52:58,611 --> 01:52:59,780
person asking this question,

1850
01:52:59,781 --> 01:53:03,420
I'm trying to think of myself that she
doesn't want to hear what I'm going to do.

1851
01:53:03,421 --> 01:53:05,780
What she wanted me to say
is, yeah, you're right,

1852
01:53:05,781 --> 01:53:10,490
your team is so horrible
and the exception, you know,

1853
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,000
they're probably just hate, you know the
world and they don't want to do like,

1854
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:18,350
like you know what it is.
They probably don't want to do a good job.

1855
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:20,420
They probably don't want to get promoted.

1856
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:22,460
They probably don't want
to make any extra money.

1857
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:26,060
They probably want to go home
unsatisfied with your job. That's their,

1858
01:53:26,070 --> 01:53:28,010
that's their deal.
Right.

1859
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:31,430
And I'm sorry that you've been burdened
with this horrible team that feels that

1860
01:53:31,431 --> 01:53:35,450
way. Yeah. Right. Cause that's
absolutely true. You don't have a whole,

1861
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,380
you might have one or two people on
your team that aren't very enthusiastic,

1862
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:43,430
but you're not going to have a whole
team that no one wants to do. Good job.

1863
01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:46,940
No one wants to put in any extra effort.
No one wants to work hard,

1864
01:53:46,970 --> 01:53:50,180
but you don't have a whole team like that.
And by the way,

1865
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:53,180
if you do have a team like that gas,

1866
01:53:53,240 --> 01:53:58,240
what it is your responsibility to get rid
of those members that don't want to do

1867
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:05,270
what they need to do to win.
Yeah.

1868
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:06,800
A lot of times when it happens,

1869
01:54:07,870 --> 01:54:11,990
when I lead people down that that
question, they'll be like, hey, you know,

1870
01:54:11,991 --> 01:54:15,040
I've got this department, and
I'll say, oh, okay, well you know,

1871
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,310
I got this department and they got these,

1872
01:54:16,700 --> 01:54:19,820
these mid level managers and they're
all horrible. I'm like, oh, well that's,

1873
01:54:19,850 --> 01:54:22,460
that's terrible. Who, who's in
charge of the mid level managers? Oh,

1874
01:54:22,461 --> 01:54:24,800
well it's this guy. Okay, who's
in charge of that guy? Oh,

1875
01:54:24,801 --> 01:54:28,430
this other guy who's in charge
of that guy. Well, I am.

1876
01:54:29,570 --> 01:54:34,250
Okay, so whose fault is this
man? Yeah, it's your fault.

1877
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:37,270
It's truly your fault.
Right?

1878
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,950
Funny, you'll do this technique,
which I always find pretty impressive.

1879
01:54:40,951 --> 01:54:43,640
Like as far as the little chip,
it's almost like a,

1880
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:46,950
it's not a chess game cause it's not
you against the asker of the question,

1881
01:54:46,980 --> 01:54:49,980
but there's an element to it.
We're just like that.

1882
01:54:49,981 --> 01:54:53,130
Like how you'd like make them answer
their own questions kind of thing. Where,

1883
01:54:53,131 --> 01:54:55,440
but you'll go, you'll say, oh, do you,

1884
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:58,920
do you think that they just
want to do a bad job? And
they'd be like, oh no, no, no,

1885
01:54:58,921 --> 01:55:01,370
no, nothing like that. Oh,
do you think that like, um,

1886
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:04,080
that they want your company to fail the,
you know,

1887
01:55:04,380 --> 01:55:07,890
those questions that goes up and down the
chain of command to cause some of like,

1888
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:08,970
well, my boss doesn't do this. I'm like,

1889
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,370
did you think of your boss wants
to lower your profitability?

1890
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,130
Do you think your boss wants you
to do things that are less safe?

1891
01:55:14,230 --> 01:55:17,220
You think your boss wants you to have
people leaving on a regular basis?

1892
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:19,800
Do you think your boss wants more
turnover? Do you think your boss,

1893
01:55:19,870 --> 01:55:22,170
you go right down the list? And of
course it's, no, no, no, no, no.

1894
01:55:22,171 --> 01:55:24,600
And eventually you realize,
oh look so calm.

1895
01:55:24,720 --> 01:55:27,840
Here's me cause I'm not communicating
well enough to explain to my boss when I

1896
01:55:27,841 --> 01:55:30,860
need. Yes, that's a good one. But it's,

1897
01:55:30,861 --> 01:55:35,040
it's good to also not only
as like something fun to
kind of watch or whatever,

1898
01:55:35,041 --> 01:55:37,610
but um, you know, so you watched
them kind of gain understanding.

1899
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:38,640
That is cool for sure.

1900
01:55:38,940 --> 01:55:43,940
But it helps because it helps
even me or people like put it into

1901
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:49,050
perspective. You know, like men, no
one's against you bro. You're like, hey,

1902
01:55:49,080 --> 01:55:52,910
you know, make some right moves in,
say some right things and men get up,

1903
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,780
get on the same page.
And by the way,

1904
01:55:54,840 --> 01:55:58,680
most of the time when someone is against
you, because there are times, you know,

1905
01:55:58,681 --> 01:56:00,170
you got that person that's a,

1906
01:56:00,780 --> 01:56:03,440
just wants to get promoted and they're
looking to step all. It's like,

1907
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:07,470
do a good job, do a great
job, keep working hard,

1908
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:12,990
make them look good. What are you talking
about? No, you make them look good.

1909
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:18,030
It will come back.
It will come back

1910
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:24,360
back to the book.
The only proof of leadership is leadership

1911
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:30,570
and the best thing to do is give it a
chance to emerge and then have competent

1912
01:56:30,571 --> 01:56:34,530
men judge whether it has appeared.
So this is another,

1913
01:56:34,620 --> 01:56:37,900
it's just hard to know what people are
like until you actually put them in this

1914
01:56:37,901 --> 01:56:41,670
situation. Although young men
can make excellent leaders,

1915
01:56:41,671 --> 01:56:44,670
leadership develops with experience,
no doubt about that.

1916
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:50,790
It is known moreover that the men
have a platoon can size each other up,

1917
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:51,540
effectively,

1918
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:54,690
can pick out men who deserve advancement
more consistently than leaders camp

1919
01:56:56,190 --> 01:56:58,130
the men. No competence
when they see it. Thus,

1920
01:56:58,140 --> 01:57:02,040
it appears that the officer who fails
to find out quietly the opinions of his

1921
01:57:02,041 --> 01:57:05,970
subordinates when he is selecting a man
for promotion is overlooking a valid

1922
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:08,970
source of information.
One that is in the long run,

1923
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:13,740
far more accurate than his own judgment.
So listen to your people

1924
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:18,660
leader.
Next section.

1925
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:23,900
Very important or important
leadership can be learned.

1926
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:28,650
There are no born leaders.

1927
01:57:28,890 --> 01:57:32,400
All leadership is based on
learning how to deal with men.

1928
01:57:33,120 --> 01:57:36,690
Nearly all leaders improve after they
have had some experience in command.

1929
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:41,310
Some improved faster than others and
some continued to improve while others do

1930
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:44,970
not.
So there are no born leaders.

1931
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:51,510
Okay, we know my debate on this,
I actually disagree with that.

1932
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:53,940
Well I should say this.
Okay,

1933
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:57,810
there might not be born leaders but there
are people that are born with certain

1934
01:57:57,811 --> 01:58:02,670
aptitudes with for a variety
of leadership qualities.

1935
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:08,130
And somebody posted something on social
media that said there's an a gene,

1936
01:58:09,240 --> 01:58:14,240
there is a gene that you have or don't
have as a human being that relates to

1937
01:58:15,091 --> 01:58:18,990
your ability to articulate.
So guess what?

1938
01:58:19,650 --> 01:58:24,300
If you are born with that dream Jean
and you have a high level ability to

1939
01:58:24,301 --> 01:58:26,820
articulate and communicate
with other human beings,

1940
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:31,260
you are born with more
aptitude to become a leader.

1941
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:33,180
Could you end up still being
a terrible leader? Yes.

1942
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:36,150
Cause there's some people that are very
articulate that are horrible leaders,

1943
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:41,300
but it is one attribute that you are
born with doesn't necessarily make you a

1944
01:58:42,071 --> 01:58:45,460
leader. Right? It gives you more aptitude
to be a leader. So maybe that is correct.

1945
01:58:45,461 --> 01:58:46,181
You're not born a leader,

1946
01:58:46,181 --> 01:58:50,950
but you're born with a little more
aptitude to be a leader. Back to the book,

1947
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:55,480
consider the qualities which enlisted
men believe important in leaders.

1948
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:59,680
The first is competency and ability.
Competence is based on learning.

1949
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:03,550
The good leader has learned
his job thoroughly, so there
you go. That makes sense.

1950
01:59:03,790 --> 01:59:05,800
His men can trust him
to know what he's doing.

1951
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:09,100
He knows not only what he
learned in his training courses,

1952
01:59:09,101 --> 01:59:11,800
but he's kept it up to date.
If he has an artillery man,

1953
01:59:11,801 --> 01:59:14,950
he knows how the Germans use
artillery and what guns they have.

1954
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:19,690
The s the rule is a simple one.
Know your stuff so that I agree with you.

1955
01:59:20,050 --> 01:59:21,460
Learn to be competent.

1956
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:27,040
Second to competence is the officer's
interest in the soldier as a man,

1957
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:31,420
a demonstrated interest that gives the
soldier confidence that when he stands up

1958
01:59:31,421 --> 01:59:32,920
to hardship or is in trouble,

1959
01:59:33,040 --> 01:59:36,820
the hardship is a necessary
part of the job and his troubles

1960
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:41,290
give his officer concerns.
So you've got to care about your people.

1961
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:45,190
And actually what's interesting about
this whole section, if you remember this,

1962
01:59:45,191 --> 01:59:47,200
is this is saying there's no born leaders,

1963
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:51,650
but there's a whole section in the first
part of this book that talks about Pete

1964
01:59:51,940 --> 01:59:56,860
men have different aptitudes and skills
that they either have or they don't

1965
01:59:56,861 --> 01:59:58,330
have. And some of it had
to do with, you know,

1966
01:59:58,331 --> 02:00:00,280
you are a truck driver
in the civilian sector,

1967
02:00:00,281 --> 02:00:03,520
so you're gonna make a good
truck driver in the military.

1968
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:07,090
But it also talked about
how some people aren't,

1969
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:09,460
don't have the aptitude for certain jobs.

1970
02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:13,780
So they're being a little bit
hypocritical here just a little bit.

1971
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:15,821
Okay,

1972
02:00:15,821 --> 02:00:19,570
so we're talking about caring about
people and here it says every man can buy,

1973
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:20,980
can buy,
practice,

1974
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:25,210
improve his skill in human understanding
and increased his repertoire of actions

1975
02:00:25,211 --> 02:00:29,950
that demonstrate interest in others.
The rule here is low, is less simple.

1976
02:00:29,980 --> 02:00:34,930
It is know your men and show it. No their
names, their history, their weaknesses,

1977
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:39,460
their good points there. Morale begin
by studying their qualification cards.

1978
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:43,120
So that's another skill
that you can get better at.

1979
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,760
Decisiveness is a skill harder to acquire,

1980
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,560
but it can with attention be it
cultivated. When you have a hard choice,

1981
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:56,710
remember, you do not usually
have to make a snap judgment.

1982
02:00:57,310 --> 02:00:58,720
Careful consideration.

1983
02:00:58,930 --> 02:01:02,520
Weighing the merits of alternate
courses is not indecision.

1984
02:01:02,670 --> 02:01:05,950
Your men will respect your
judgement even more if you deserve.

1985
02:01:06,110 --> 02:01:10,630
If you reserve decision until you are
in possession of all the facts necessary

1986
02:01:10,631 --> 02:01:11,680
for a wise choice,

1987
02:01:13,150 --> 02:01:17,680
do not set up a council of
war to pass things by vote.

1988
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:21,700
You are the leader,
but seek advice when you need it.

1989
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,910
And do not hesitate to call on your
subordinates for council if they are

1990
02:01:24,911 --> 02:01:28,720
qualified to give it. But choose your
course before you give the orders,

1991
02:01:28,721 --> 02:01:33,340
which we already heard. So there's,
and this is also a little bit contrary,

1992
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:36,580
we're not contrary, but this is an
addendum to what was being said earlier,

1993
02:01:36,581 --> 02:01:40,220
that you gotta be decisive. And here
is saying, look, you gotta be decisive,

1994
02:01:40,221 --> 02:01:43,370
but you can take your time.
You want to measure everything out.

1995
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:47,000
Another suggest,

1996
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:52,030
another suggestion to the leader
is remember when you're men,

1997
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:56,120
do not understand you
that it is your fault.

1998
02:01:58,940 --> 02:02:02,960
You must talk their language,
plain language.

1999
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,090
If you cannot express yourself clearly,

2000
02:02:05,091 --> 02:02:08,090
it may be because you do not
understand the subject to yourself.

2001
02:02:08,330 --> 02:02:12,890
Think things through carefully before
you try to explain. So there you go.

2002
02:02:12,891 --> 02:02:15,530
A little extreme ownership,
a little simplicity in there.

2003
02:02:17,210 --> 02:02:22,210
A leader then to be worthy in the eyes
of his men would do well to follow these

2004
02:02:23,090 --> 02:02:26,180
commands. Number one, be competent.

2005
02:02:26,780 --> 02:02:31,220
Number to be loyal to your men as
well as to your country and army.

2006
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:37,040
Number three, know your men. Understand
them. Love them. Be Proud of them.

2007
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:40,010
Number four,

2008
02:02:40,400 --> 02:02:44,870
accept responsibility and
give clear decisive orders.

2009
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:46,460
Yeah.

2010
02:02:46,460 --> 02:02:47,330
Number five,

2011
02:02:47,770 --> 02:02:51,470
teach your men by putting them
through the necessary action.

2012
02:02:53,280 --> 02:02:57,450
Number six, give only
necessary orders. Bought.

2013
02:02:57,480 --> 02:03:00,240
Number seven,
get things done.

2014
02:03:02,370 --> 02:03:07,200
Number Eight, be fair.
Number nine, work hard.

2015
02:03:09,410 --> 02:03:14,410
Number 10 remember that a leader is a
symbol men need to respect and trust.

2016
02:03:16,421 --> 02:03:19,660
You.
Don't let them down.

2017
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:20,990
Yeah,

2018
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:24,260
so there you go.
They they wrap it all back into

2019
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:27,650
from everything we started started this
thing talking about when you're talking

2020
02:03:27,651 --> 02:03:29,170
about discipline and obedience.
Hmm.

2021
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:34,010
This whole thing about being a leader
has nothing to do with obedience.

2022
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:36,830
It has to do with being a good leader.
Yeah,

2023
02:03:37,520 --> 02:03:41,150
and that's how they wrap up that chapter.
That's

2024
02:03:42,650 --> 02:03:44,480
solid information in there.

2025
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:49,570
Now this next section is about mobs and
panic and what's interesting about this

2026
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:55,970
is as a human being in
charge of other human beings,

2027
02:03:55,971 --> 02:04:00,170
you have to understand how mobs and
panic on fold going back to the book,

2028
02:04:00,171 --> 02:04:03,710
men and a mob act just as much in keeping
with their past training and habits as

2029
02:04:03,711 --> 02:04:04,790
they would if they were alone.

2030
02:04:04,850 --> 02:04:09,850
But part of this training which men get
from earliest childhood is to follow the

2031
02:04:10,071 --> 02:04:13,970
example of other individuals and
also to respond to their gestures,

2032
02:04:13,971 --> 02:04:18,230
facial expressions and tones of voice
as well as other as well as the spoken

2033
02:04:18,231 --> 02:04:20,860
words of others. That's an
interesting concept, isn't it?

2034
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:25,670
It's a little trick statement
because what it's saying is, hey,

2035
02:04:26,180 --> 02:04:27,620
when you've got a mob of people,

2036
02:04:28,220 --> 02:04:31,070
they are acting in accordance
with how they've been trained,

2037
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:33,470
but then you think yourself wasn't in the
army, then they wouldn't act that way.

2038
02:04:33,620 --> 02:04:37,710
But then it goes on to say they'd been
trained since day one to imitate people.

2039
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:42,330
So you're actually fighting against
the rest of their training when you're

2040
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:46,410
trying to get them to not do
something that everyone else is doing.

2041
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:49,350
And by the way,
it's,

2042
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:52,980
it's an important thing that usually is
beneficial and it goes into some of that

2043
02:04:52,981 --> 02:04:55,110
here.
When a soldier misunderstands a command,

2044
02:04:55,111 --> 02:04:57,720
he starts to execute it
as he interpreted it.

2045
02:04:58,110 --> 02:04:59,640
But suppose in the middle of a movement,

2046
02:04:59,641 --> 02:05:03,570
he become suddenly aware that the other
men in ranks are doing something very

2047
02:05:03,571 --> 02:05:07,710
different. Immediately he corrects his
action to do what others are doing.

2048
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:11,010
So most of the time it's beneficial.
That little mob mentality,

2049
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:12,960
in the same way,

2050
02:05:12,961 --> 02:05:16,770
the site of a leader running or galloping
to the rear in a combat area may start

2051
02:05:16,771 --> 02:05:19,020
a whole company heading
after him on the double.

2052
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:24,180
His example can become as much a
command as or order as his words.

2053
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:28,170
Mostly. It is a good thing that men
naturally follow the example of others.

2054
02:05:28,171 --> 02:05:32,490
It makes the world run more smoothly. Yet
the good principal has vicious results.

2055
02:05:32,491 --> 02:05:34,770
When mobs form or panic starts.

2056
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:40,820
Why mobs for moms form because some one
event or condition has brought people

2057
02:05:40,981 --> 02:05:44,250
together and captured the attention
of every person in the crowd.

2058
02:05:44,251 --> 02:05:47,730
Usually the mom is angry about
something and it is and it's angry.

2059
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:49,740
Excitement makes it ready for action.

2060
02:05:50,160 --> 02:05:53,850
Panic based on fear is something else.

2061
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:59,330
So a differentiate between the mob that
is angry and the mob that is afraid.

2062
02:06:00,690 --> 02:06:04,110
That's panicking besides a
common focus of attention.

2063
02:06:04,111 --> 02:06:06,150
So that's one element is the
common focus of attention.

2064
02:06:06,270 --> 02:06:09,120
Emotion is characteristic of all mobs.

2065
02:06:09,210 --> 02:06:11,670
Since a mob is driven by powerful emotion,

2066
02:06:11,671 --> 02:06:14,610
it is not necessarily
crazy to do something.

2067
02:06:15,390 --> 02:06:20,390
It wants action so it only takes a cry
of Lynch him or burn it to set the mob in

2068
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:26,400
motion. Mostly when you get
into a crowd you join it,

2069
02:06:27,480 --> 02:06:30,810
you do just what other people do.
The site of others,

2070
02:06:30,811 --> 02:06:33,100
seizing stones or starting an attack.

2071
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:37,680
So grips the men watching them that
they think of no other course of action

2072
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:38,731
mobs.

2073
02:06:38,731 --> 02:06:43,731
Therefore our uncritical
interesting statements about mobs.

2074
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:47,190
I'm trying to think when have
you been a part of a mob before?

2075
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:51,190
No, I mean in that regard, no,

2076
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:55,560
I've been at some shows and by that I
mean hardcore shows back in the day where

2077
02:06:55,740 --> 02:06:58,450
the mob would start to get something,
you know,

2078
02:06:58,530 --> 02:07:02,400
like whether it was breaking
down a barrier and yeah,

2079
02:07:02,430 --> 02:07:05,940
you get swept up in that mob mentality.
It's group think

2080
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:10,980
this one's talking about panic.
Soldiers do not often for mobs,

2081
02:07:10,981 --> 02:07:15,210
mob action among soldiers usually
occurs when they are away from the usual

2082
02:07:15,211 --> 02:07:19,230
reminders in circumstances of discipline
when they are on leave and mingling

2083
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:21,600
with men from our,
the organization's without leadership,

2084
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:26,130
but panic can occur in the best
drilled. Thirdly, season troops,

2085
02:07:26,370 --> 02:07:28,350
it can occur in the midst of combat.

2086
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:32,490
Some of the greatest routes in
history have been cases of panic.

2087
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:37,090
The panicked group is much like a
mob, but it acts from fear, not anger.

2088
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:40,390
It's attention is focused
on the object of fear.

2089
02:07:40,690 --> 02:07:45,400
It's thought and it's talk is of danger
and disaster. It's aim is escape.

2090
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:50,290
Action becomes definite and mob like
only when obstacles to escape are

2091
02:07:50,291 --> 02:07:51,124
encountered.

2092
02:07:52,980 --> 02:07:57,980
It doesn't take much to set off a
panic among troops who are panic ripe.

2093
02:07:59,740 --> 02:08:04,740
Then a single cry of gas or run or we're
caught off may start a mad flight and

2094
02:08:05,441 --> 02:08:07,360
here it talks about panic ripeness.

2095
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:11,170
Anything that makes men tense on edge,

2096
02:08:11,171 --> 02:08:13,540
jittery and over sensitive
to slight noises,

2097
02:08:13,990 --> 02:08:18,730
half hidden sites or sudden movements,
we'll make them easy victims of panic.

2098
02:08:19,090 --> 02:08:23,020
For this reason,
prolonged anxiety makes men panic ripe,

2099
02:08:23,530 --> 02:08:27,940
so does over fatigue,
too much beer or liquor or a hangover.

2100
02:08:28,030 --> 02:08:29,680
So does lack of proper food,

2101
02:08:29,681 --> 02:08:34,060
especially deficiency of B vitamins and
so does exhaustion from lack of sleep.

2102
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:38,740
Prolonged exposure to noise and alarm
of modern battle may produce the jumpy

2103
02:08:38,741 --> 02:08:41,110
state of mind from which panic arises.

2104
02:08:42,280 --> 02:08:45,160
One main cause of panic
is lack of training.

2105
02:08:45,161 --> 02:08:49,240
Training must cover practice and defense
and retreat as well as in attack.

2106
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:53,350
If panic is to be avoided if the
retreat is not to turn into a route,

2107
02:08:55,030 --> 02:08:57,370
the sight of one or several
men running to the rear,

2108
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:00,700
the site of others
throwing away their gear.

2109
02:09:00,701 --> 02:09:05,701
Weapons may cause a general scramble
and discarding of arms bad morale is

2110
02:09:06,851 --> 02:09:11,020
another cause of panic. Rumor sometimes
plays an important part in Redding.

2111
02:09:11,021 --> 02:09:11,950
Men for panic.

2112
02:09:12,130 --> 02:09:16,480
Poor leadership can make
the ground ready for panic,

2113
02:09:16,660 --> 02:09:20,980
impairing the confidence and
command necessary to hold
troops to the performance

2114
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:26,170
of duty. How to stop a panic.
This is very important.

2115
02:09:26,171 --> 02:09:27,400
Once a panic has begun,

2116
02:09:27,401 --> 02:09:31,340
the only way to Holt it is to
capture attention and then provide,

2117
02:09:31,390 --> 02:09:33,670
provide positive,
clear commands.

2118
02:09:35,440 --> 02:09:38,950
Leaders must act with decision,
firmness and courage.

2119
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:41,530
If no officer is present,

2120
02:09:41,560 --> 02:09:46,270
any self possessed man can
assume leadership and give
the scared men what they

2121
02:09:46,271 --> 02:09:48,340
need. Clear, confident direction.

2122
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,950
So I think the important is
to import important parts.

2123
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,810
You've got to get their attention and
then you got to give simple, clear,

2124
02:09:56,110 --> 02:10:00,670
concise commands, positive commands
and then it goes on to say,

2125
02:10:00,671 --> 02:10:04,630
but the best way to stop a panic
is never to have it at all.

2126
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:08,800
Train all men through release so that
they have confidence in themselves,

2127
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:12,550
their leaders, their weapons. Train their
leaders and select the best of them.

2128
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:15,550
Let good leaders build up good morale,
avoid hunger,

2129
02:10:15,551 --> 02:10:20,551
thirst and boredom as much as possible
to do in war and all the conditions that

2130
02:10:21,311 --> 02:10:26,290
lead to nervous tension and complaint.
If you could not avoid them.

2131
02:10:26,440 --> 02:10:29,740
And war is no bed of roses.
Fight them with good morale.

2132
02:10:29,800 --> 02:10:33,230
Fight the feeling of insecurity.
Tell the men all they need to know.

2133
02:10:33,380 --> 02:10:36,530
Let them know all possible information
about the enemy, where he is,

2134
02:10:36,531 --> 02:10:40,970
what he is like, how we attacks, what
weapons he is using. Last but not least,

2135
02:10:40,971 --> 02:10:44,900
build up faith. Be sure the
men know why they are fighting,

2136
02:10:45,080 --> 02:10:46,580
why it is a good cause.

2137
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:50,840
Let them be sure that their
officers are with them all the way.

2138
02:10:51,680 --> 02:10:56,210
Faith in an ideal plus faith
in your leaders plus faith
in other fellows in your

2139
02:10:56,211 --> 02:11:00,290
unit can win victory
against superior forces.

2140
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:03,570
Okay,

2141
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:08,190
so there you go. You got to
watch out for that. Next section.

2142
02:11:08,280 --> 02:11:13,280
Differences among races and people's
modern total war has placed a new

2143
02:11:14,851 --> 02:11:16,410
responsibility on the shoulders,

2144
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:21,440
shoulders of the soldier once his
only task was to destroy the enemy.

2145
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:25,500
But now psychological warfare
requires him to play a new role.

2146
02:11:25,680 --> 02:11:30,210
He must help when allies for
Uncle Sam in many strange lands,

2147
02:11:30,570 --> 02:11:33,450
and this is what's interesting,
we always think of world war well.

2148
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:36,450
We think of World War Two for
sure as, hey, this is total war.

2149
02:11:36,451 --> 02:11:38,880
You're not worried about hearts
and minds, which was, you know,

2150
02:11:38,881 --> 02:11:42,900
the campaign it in really in
Vietnam it was hearts and minds.

2151
02:11:42,901 --> 02:11:46,440
It's where that kind of originated
and certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan,

2152
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:49,740
we think all those guys didn't have
to deal with this back in the day.

2153
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:51,730
You have to deal with this.
Now we are.

2154
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:54,030
We have to worry about the
civilian populace and all this.

2155
02:11:54,031 --> 02:11:58,590
Guess what we're wrong. Hmm.
1942 they're talking about this

2156
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,620
and it goes into,

2157
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:05,790
there are no infallible recipes for
making friends the world around.

2158
02:12:06,750 --> 02:12:11,040
But there are two basic rules for all
soldiers in the manual of psychological

2159
02:12:11,041 --> 02:12:15,180
arms. Number one, mind your manners.

2160
02:12:16,710 --> 02:12:20,370
Number two, understand and
respect the manners of strangers,

2161
02:12:20,371 --> 02:12:25,200
especially strangers who might help both
you and the cause for which you were

2162
02:12:25,201 --> 02:12:27,840
fighting seems pretty obvious.

2163
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:28,823
Hmm.

2164
02:12:30,370 --> 02:12:34,690
And no one thinks that in world war
two they had to watch their manners,

2165
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:39,040
but you do.
Next one talking about race,

2166
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:44,400
color of the skin is often the basis
for prejudice because it is so clearly a

2167
02:12:44,531 --> 02:12:46,900
badge of difference between people's,
uh,

2168
02:12:46,901 --> 02:12:51,901
mark that sets one people apart as
different as not one of us American whites

2169
02:12:54,251 --> 02:12:58,780
have been prejudice not only against
blacks skins but also against yellow and

2170
02:12:58,781 --> 02:13:01,120
against copper skins
of the American Indian.

2171
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:06,930
The United States excluded both
jabs and Chinese from immigration.

2172
02:13:07,061 --> 02:13:11,980
When our western states became afraid
of their cheap labor and the old German

2173
02:13:11,981 --> 02:13:15,340
Kaiser invented the slogan,
the yellow peril,

2174
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:18,970
when he wished to unite
Europe against the Asiatics.

2175
02:13:19,690 --> 02:13:24,340
And what I find interesting about this
whole thing is this is 1942 so this is

2176
02:13:24,610 --> 02:13:27,340
pre civil rights movement in America

2177
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:34,540
and yet we find the military forward
leaning on civil rights and we'll get to

2178
02:13:34,861 --> 02:13:35,490
that.

2179
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:39,870
Sometimes the prejudice against
the negroes flares up in the army.

2180
02:13:41,370 --> 02:13:43,290
It is not a problem.
However,

2181
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:47,940
in a camp where it is well understood
that a soldier in the United States

2182
02:13:47,941 --> 02:13:49,740
uniform is a soldier,

2183
02:13:50,310 --> 02:13:54,990
not a white or a Negro Christian
or Jew rich man or poor,

2184
02:13:55,200 --> 02:13:59,640
but a soldier.
And as such worthy of respect

2185
02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:03,570
and not everyone feels race prejudice.

2186
02:14:03,571 --> 02:14:07,290
There are plenty of white men who are
constantly meeting and working with black,

2187
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:10,350
brown and yellow men of education,
culture, brain's inability.

2188
02:14:10,530 --> 02:14:14,940
These white men know that skin color is
not a sign of inferiority or superior or

2189
02:14:14,941 --> 02:14:19,710
superiority and they tend to forget about
it or at least to regard it is or at

2190
02:14:19,711 --> 02:14:23,760
least regarded as unimportant.
These white men are numerous in Europe,

2191
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:24,630
South America,

2192
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:29,340
Asia and Africa where the races are
mixed up in business and in politics.

2193
02:14:31,150 --> 02:14:31,983
Yeah,

2194
02:14:32,240 --> 02:14:37,240
the American soldier will be on the
right track when he realizes that the

2195
02:14:37,371 --> 02:14:39,470
differences are superficial,

2196
02:14:39,650 --> 02:14:44,360
that other races while different from
his own or not necessarily inferior,

2197
02:14:44,990 --> 02:14:49,430
he will know that he cannot tell just
from a man's color whether that man will

2198
02:14:49,431 --> 02:14:53,150
bind up his wounds, guide him to a
hospital when he his last feed him.

2199
02:14:53,151 --> 02:14:56,990
If he is hungry or help
them repel enemy invaders,

2200
02:14:58,040 --> 02:15:02,360
it will help him to remember that skin
color in itself means nothing about the

2201
02:15:02,361 --> 02:15:06,740
intelligence, wisdom, honesty,
bravery or kindliness of a man.

2202
02:15:07,790 --> 02:15:11,120
If he studies carefully the people
of other races whom he meets,

2203
02:15:11,600 --> 02:15:14,570
he can satisfy himself that this is true.

2204
02:15:16,210 --> 02:15:17,043
So again,

2205
02:15:17,200 --> 02:15:22,200
1942 pre civil rights and
the military is saying,

2206
02:15:22,630 --> 02:15:25,450
Hey, guess what folks?
Race doesn't matter.

2207
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:31,270
And by the way,
still a segregated army,

2208
02:15:33,970 --> 02:15:34,640
but

2209
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:36,560
they're moving in the right direction.

2210
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,790
How to win friends in foreign lands.

2211
02:15:41,810 --> 02:15:44,870
Every American soldier in a foreign
land becomes an American diplomat.

2212
02:15:45,080 --> 02:15:48,920
He has his role to play in making
strange people into Americans,

2213
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:53,720
America's friends. Here's some
rules he will find helpful. Again,

2214
02:15:53,721 --> 02:15:58,070
this is so interesting to read because
I'm telling you when you're in the

2215
02:15:58,071 --> 02:16:01,400
military you think all these guys
back to the night team, World War Two,

2216
02:16:01,401 --> 02:16:04,820
they didn't have to worry about that and
we just went over there and kicked ass

2217
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:08,660
shit. And it's like here they were
getting the briefs. This is the brief.

2218
02:16:08,661 --> 02:16:09,560
This is the big brief

2219
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:15,410
and here's some things that that
will help you be a good diplomat.

2220
02:16:17,270 --> 02:16:17,820
Yeah,

2221
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:21,000
and this is applicable like this is
when you go and work with a new company,

2222
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:26,400
guess what you want to, you want, you
do want to win the hearts and minds.

2223
02:16:26,730 --> 02:16:29,620
Here's a couple tips. One, try.

2224
02:16:29,621 --> 02:16:32,980
First of all the understand strange
customs habits and ways of thinkings.

2225
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:33,731
Number two,

2226
02:16:33,731 --> 02:16:37,420
respect these customs and
habits of thought even when
you can't understand them

2227
02:16:37,421 --> 02:16:40,780
and even when they seem
unpleasant or a feminine or crazy.

2228
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:46,780
Three when you cannot
respect foreign countries,

2229
02:16:47,230 --> 02:16:50,260
then suppress your disapproval,
stifle your emotions.

2230
02:16:52,450 --> 02:16:55,090
When you can respect foreign customs,
show it.

2231
02:16:55,570 --> 02:16:59,680
You can win many friends for
America in this simple way. Five,

2232
02:16:59,890 --> 02:17:03,160
when you associate with foreign
people try to adopt their manners.

2233
02:17:03,161 --> 02:17:05,470
Do not ask them to adopt yours.

2234
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:06,893
Okay.

2235
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:11,960
Suppress your own peculiarities as far
as possible when they are contrary to the

2236
02:17:12,181 --> 02:17:13,560
customs of the land.

2237
02:17:14,710 --> 02:17:15,390
Yeah.

2238
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:16,223
Number seven,

2239
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:20,250
when foreign customs or none of your
business in mind only your own business.

2240
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,970
Number eight,
be friendly after all,

2241
02:17:23,971 --> 02:17:28,350
the only way to make other men like
you is to like them. And number nine,

2242
02:17:28,351 --> 02:17:32,610
take people as they come
like them for what they are,

2243
02:17:32,790 --> 02:17:35,550
not for the way they happen,
to measure up to your own standards,

2244
02:17:35,610 --> 02:17:36,900
what you expected of them.

2245
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,000
So really good guidance
just in general for humans.

2246
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:46,490
Those interesting there,
there,

2247
02:17:47,980 --> 02:17:52,640
what did, what did he say? If it's like
if their customs or a feminine or, yeah,

2248
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:58,140
so I remember what I was learning Spanish
in high school and they were talking

2249
02:17:58,731 --> 02:18:01,540
about there's a difference between
Spanish in Spain and Mexico and different,

2250
02:18:01,550 --> 02:18:02,270
you know,
it's a different

2251
02:18:02,270 --> 02:18:06,380
Castilian Spanish versus that's what
they speak in Spain. Oh, for real? Yeah.

2252
02:18:06,381 --> 02:18:09,260
And in Mexico they speak, I don't
know if they call it Mexican Spanish.

2253
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:14,130
Hmm. But it's fast still. I remember,

2254
02:18:14,150 --> 02:18:17,800
you know, in part of the,
you know, the course, um,

2255
02:18:18,070 --> 02:18:20,670
they were talking about different
customs and stuff like that. So I guess,

2256
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:25,560
you know, in, in Spain they say the
SS with a list like a tea or disease,

2257
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:27,970
it's just a little bit. Yeah. Um,

2258
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:32,020
but there was this one custom that I
can remember that they're like, oh yeah.

2259
02:18:32,021 --> 02:18:35,620
It's not uncommon to see like men holding
hands when they're free. You know,

2260
02:18:35,621 --> 02:18:39,070
how like, Hey your, do you have your
hand? Right guys? Just holding hands.

2261
02:18:39,071 --> 02:18:42,880
That's how you know. And um, I remember
thinking that's interesting. You know,

2262
02:18:42,881 --> 02:18:46,550
because that's something that's really
far from custom here. Yeah. Yeah.

2263
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:49,060
But we will have her
hand like our arm around,

2264
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:51,090
you know when you're a kid you
got your arms around your boys.

2265
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:55,430
Yeah. But you're not, you're
not just walking around
like that sometimes I guess.

2266
02:18:55,520 --> 02:18:58,780
I don't know when you're, you're
doing it. Okay. You're a kid. Yeah.

2267
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:02,720
You're walking off the football
field after a good play. Sure.

2268
02:19:02,721 --> 02:19:03,980
You might have your arm
around. You're right. Yeah.

2269
02:19:04,160 --> 02:19:07,350
You're not walking down the sidewalk.
Cater to a movie with your arm. Right.

2270
02:19:07,360 --> 02:19:10,340
Your buddy that's not happening.
Yes. So you're right. And that,

2271
02:19:10,341 --> 02:19:13,670
that custom of holding hands
is really common throughout.

2272
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:18,170
Like dude's holding hands is a real
common throughout the rest of the world.

2273
02:19:18,171 --> 02:19:20,960
Like lots of different places do
that. Yeah. And it's definitely,

2274
02:19:22,130 --> 02:19:26,050
we definitely get some funny
situations where the, the,

2275
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:28,100
the seal that's,
you know,

2276
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:32,810
Super Macho and we're over working with
some in some foreign country and some

2277
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:34,400
guys, you know, they,
they're talking to them,

2278
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:36,560
they start to like him or wherever
they started getting along.

2279
02:19:36,980 --> 02:19:39,080
We're going to start holding the hands on.
I'll walk over to the galley.

2280
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:43,220
He see she see a TV as leg and nod out.

2281
02:19:44,960 --> 02:19:47,180
Somebody needs to brief
you on our customs.

2282
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:50,990
We don't do that well according to
the book. That's what I'm saying.

2283
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:56,780
You got to, you know, just go
ahead and hold the advancements
in homeboy. But yeah,

2284
02:19:56,781 --> 02:20:01,750
that's the kind of thing that,
that is rough for Americans,

2285
02:20:01,880 --> 02:20:04,130
especially American dudes to get over.

2286
02:20:04,610 --> 02:20:08,030
We're just going to walk around
holding hands or like, you know how um,

2287
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:11,570
in Europe they'll like
kiss not necessarily on the
lips necessarily. Right.

2288
02:20:11,571 --> 02:20:15,080
Butt Cheek, right? Yeah. He
tried to kiss me on the cheek.

2289
02:20:15,090 --> 02:20:20,090
Dud that make me weird for the day is
jam me weird for the day for me to do it.

2290
02:20:21,350 --> 02:20:22,820
If I send me random.
Yeah,

2291
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:26,490
no kissing is no factor
in much of the world for,

2292
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:30,890
for a guy to kiss another guy like,
hey good to see you plant one on me.

2293
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:35,300
Here's an American. It's like, Hey, good
to see you. Keep out of my personal space.

2294
02:20:36,220 --> 02:20:38,160
Actually you don't have to be honest.
Um,

2295
02:20:38,450 --> 02:20:41,700
I don't care like people actually some
of my friends, they, you know, some,

2296
02:20:42,050 --> 02:20:44,270
you know like the Italian
mafia kind of thing.

2297
02:20:44,271 --> 02:20:46,730
Like they'll build it and we'll do that.
So my friends,

2298
02:20:46,731 --> 02:20:51,710
they kind of know what the f you know
what thing broke down my personal space

2299
02:20:51,711 --> 02:20:53,540
more than anything else. Yes I do. Yes.

2300
02:20:53,700 --> 02:20:58,200
She just uses the whole thing of like
hugging another dude when you see him.

2301
02:20:58,610 --> 02:21:01,800
I think that stemmed from Jujitsu.
Oh frill.

2302
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:05,240
I don't remember ever
doing that before Jujitsu.

2303
02:21:06,080 --> 02:21:08,870
I have to think more,
but it just cause cause you did,

2304
02:21:08,871 --> 02:21:13,220
sue is so close anyways that when you,
you know,

2305
02:21:13,221 --> 02:21:16,880
you're just like that's the way it
is. Yeah. So do Jitsu once again,

2306
02:21:17,060 --> 02:21:20,360
spreading for the spreading
customs around the world,

2307
02:21:20,900 --> 02:21:23,660
breaking down boundaries,
breaking down boundaries.

2308
02:21:23,661 --> 02:21:26,750
They broke down boundaries
for me in Hawaii,

2309
02:21:26,751 --> 02:21:29,800
there's a lot of kissing that
goes on, mostly between, um,

2310
02:21:30,590 --> 02:21:32,660
like between slightly, you
know, like girls and guys,

2311
02:21:32,661 --> 02:21:36,170
like even like if it's like your
friend's wife, you kiss him on the cheek.

2312
02:21:36,171 --> 02:21:39,490
That's how like it's in fact if
you don't, it's kind of like, hmm.

2313
02:21:39,590 --> 02:21:42,860
That was kind of standoffish kind of
thing. Not a huge deal, but it's like,

2314
02:21:42,980 --> 02:21:46,910
it's that normal in Hawaii.
Um, but guys and guys,

2315
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,930
you know, I don't, I don't
think that that's an issue.

2316
02:21:50,931 --> 02:21:53,510
Like if someone kissed me on my cheek
when they saw me and it was a guy,

2317
02:21:53,890 --> 02:21:57,110
I love you bro, whatever.
Like that wouldn't, that
wouldn't move me either way.

2318
02:21:57,111 --> 02:22:00,420
That'd be like, yeah, fine.
But I'm saying if you,

2319
02:22:00,421 --> 02:22:04,800
you did cause you would have like a
specific type of personality, you know,

2320
02:22:05,100 --> 02:22:08,420
they'd be like,
that's a new new thing for chocolate.

2321
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:12,330
Guess that would be a new
exploration, I guess. Brother.

2322
02:22:12,331 --> 02:22:15,710
There was a time where I think we're doing
like a Facebook live or something and

2323
02:22:15,711 --> 02:22:19,730
we're talking about cauliflower
ear and um, and I was like oil.

2324
02:22:19,731 --> 02:22:22,040
So I said something about late
after your ears are like soft.

2325
02:22:22,041 --> 02:22:26,250
And then I went and you were right next
to me and I, and I like, like flipped

2326
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:29,610
your ear or something.
And when I watched the live later,

2327
02:22:29,611 --> 02:22:32,280
the look on your face was like,
you were genuinely,

2328
02:22:32,610 --> 02:22:36,180
not in a big way but
genuinely slightly offended by

2329
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:40,950
my ear.
Like it was micro was there.

2330
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,670
I was at my Jujitsu Academy when I was
in Virginia Beach and there was a buddy

2331
02:22:44,671 --> 02:22:45,960
of mine,
another seal,

2332
02:22:46,440 --> 02:22:49,740
and I had gotten him into Jiu
Jitsu and he was a small guy,

2333
02:22:50,250 --> 02:22:54,630
like one 41 45 scenario and,
but you know,

2334
02:22:54,631 --> 02:22:58,290
he was like a white belt, had been
trained in and whatnot. And um,

2335
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:00,871
we were both,

2336
02:23:00,871 --> 02:23:05,871
so now we were training and one night
I showed up at the academy and we both

2337
02:23:06,481 --> 02:23:08,040
showed up at the same time,
like similar time.

2338
02:23:08,041 --> 02:23:12,480
And in this academy it was Gustava
Machado and Guga as his nickname.

2339
02:23:12,780 --> 02:23:14,640
Great Dude.
And so we,

2340
02:23:14,641 --> 02:23:18,690
and Google is academy at the time was
pretty small and it had one bathroom and

2341
02:23:18,691 --> 02:23:21,840
the bathroom is where you would change.
So like put your d on or whatever.

2342
02:23:22,500 --> 02:23:27,500
So my buddy goes in there
and he starts changing.

2343
02:23:28,471 --> 02:23:32,820
And me being just like a team guy,
I'm like, whatever I'm going into. So,

2344
02:23:32,910 --> 02:23:36,930
and he's a lot smaller than me and I'm
a blue belt at this time. So you know,

2345
02:23:36,931 --> 02:23:40,920
there's, there's that
level of, of uh, you know,

2346
02:23:40,950 --> 02:23:45,840
like Keke he knows that the
situation unfolds. I can submit him.

2347
02:23:45,841 --> 02:23:50,100
That's the way it is. And so I just bust
into the bathroom and he's in there.

2348
02:23:50,101 --> 02:23:53,460
He's changing. So He's, you know, I
don't know if he was completely naked,

2349
02:23:53,461 --> 02:23:57,870
but he was pretty close. And I come in
and just drop my a rip off my shirt,

2350
02:23:57,871 --> 02:24:02,720
dropped my shorts and, and,
and, and I hear him go, oh,

2351
02:24:03,420 --> 02:24:06,990
and then he goes, and then he
goes, uh, think of a happy place.

2352
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:12,200
We both started laughing, but, um, yeah,

2353
02:24:13,630 --> 02:24:16,620
don't care about any of that stuff.
So there you go,

2354
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:22,280
try and try and accept other people's
customs and don't try and impose your

2355
02:24:25,711 --> 02:24:30,711
customs on them or you're not doing
good for the diplomacy of the country.

2356
02:24:32,330 --> 02:24:35,250
Yeah, yeah. Like, even
when you go to like France,

2357
02:24:35,280 --> 02:24:37,830
not to keep the customs
thing going too long,

2358
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:40,770
but whether it be France or wherever.
Right.

2359
02:24:42,960 --> 02:24:44,190
Here's the,
it's a hard one.

2360
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:47,520
So let's say you go to the beach where
they can go topless. They're at the beach,

2361
02:24:47,550 --> 02:24:50,190
right? What if you're with your wife
or whatever and your wife's like, oh,

2362
02:24:50,191 --> 02:24:52,440
we're in France. I want
to go topless. You know,

2363
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:57,660
how do you feel about
that? Whatever. All good.

2364
02:24:59,100 --> 02:25:01,830
I don't think we're going
to a topless beach actually.

2365
02:25:02,250 --> 02:25:03,510
What she wanted to go though,

2366
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:08,070
she doesn't answer the way I would see it.

2367
02:25:08,400 --> 02:25:10,560
We're so conservative.
Right? Isn't that crazy?

2368
02:25:10,620 --> 02:25:15,480
We're super conservative for it
to actually, puritans are legit.

2369
02:25:15,810 --> 02:25:18,780
Yeah. I like the puritans. It
meant that's the New England.

2370
02:25:18,781 --> 02:25:22,110
There's a little thread of puritanism
up in New England and I was like that.

2371
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:24,080
Yeah, I can dig it. Um,

2372
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:28,510
at a topless beach, I would let
totally let my wife go. Totally.

2373
02:25:29,020 --> 02:25:33,660
Except if there is anyone there
that we knew. Interesting.

2374
02:25:33,690 --> 02:25:37,560
So like if my brother's
friends or if my friend,

2375
02:25:37,590 --> 02:25:40,140
unless it was her girlfriends,
I wouldn't care. But yeah,

2376
02:25:40,141 --> 02:25:45,000
if it was any of our friends that we knew
there were guys that would bother me,

2377
02:25:45,001 --> 02:25:48,210
I think, well my wife just be,
she'd be wearing a swimsuit.

2378
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:52,920
This is no real big discussion.
Right. The Edna, I did dig it.

2379
02:25:53,100 --> 02:25:55,800
Would you wear,
you know how they were like the more what,

2380
02:25:55,801 --> 02:26:00,720
like the trunks that are like speedo
type trunks. That's how you know it's a,

2381
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:03,450
it's a speedo. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Would that be all you are?

2382
02:26:03,451 --> 02:26:06,740
We need to stick with this. I
wear surf shorts. I probably,

2383
02:26:06,741 --> 02:26:10,050
you got books as in Brazil,
you know,

2384
02:26:10,051 --> 02:26:15,050
it's called a song gow yet. Hello?
Yeah. And Dean lister, this the,

2385
02:26:16,280 --> 02:26:17,113
Oh,

2386
02:26:17,410 --> 02:26:21,940
I'm good friends with dean. Sure. He went
through a phase of wearing a sung gow

2387
02:26:22,040 --> 02:26:22,700
yeah.

2388
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:27,700
A lot to train him and like that at all
dudes basically wearing a speedo and

2389
02:26:28,281 --> 02:26:33,040
beating me up and not fun. Yeah. And he'd
go with no shirt for sure. So yeah. That,

2390
02:26:33,050 --> 02:26:36,610
that's um, yeah, where that
[inaudible] needs to do that for sure.

2391
02:26:37,390 --> 02:26:42,020
They used to be pretty common
for, it's definitely faded
right now. Yeah, for sure.

2392
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:45,950
The idea of just wearing
the tidy whities song.

2393
02:26:45,951 --> 02:26:49,700
Gow grappling. Yeah, for
sure. For sure. Fully.

2394
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:53,880
But on the beach though, you got to lay
up Brazil, Brazil. That's your normal.

2395
02:26:53,930 --> 02:26:57,180
That's, that's the custom, but not you.
You're not going to adopt that customer.

2396
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:59,000
I'm American dude. I know Bro. But you,

2397
02:26:59,010 --> 02:27:02,660
when you go to these foreign lands to
America, you know, turn the box me.

2398
02:27:02,661 --> 02:27:05,900
I'm just saying the book said, I
didn't say the book said, you know,

2399
02:27:05,990 --> 02:27:09,240
and you're just, you're going to so
bay, that Brown, whatever you like.

2400
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:14,480
Yeah. I'm going to stick to
this. Your dish. That's what
we do over here. Yes sir.

2401
02:27:16,270 --> 02:27:20,440
You done? Yes sir. Trying
to frame me up. Rumor,

2402
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:26,050
rumor is the most primitive
way of spreading stories
by passing on from mouth to

2403
02:27:26,051 --> 02:27:30,280
mouth. It is just as inefficient,
inaccurate and unaccountable
as it is. Primitive.

2404
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:34,480
Rumors are repeated by even by
those who do not believe the tails.

2405
02:27:34,540 --> 02:27:37,360
That's an interesting statement
and it's very true. This is this.

2406
02:27:37,361 --> 02:27:38,350
This is an interesting state.

2407
02:27:38,351 --> 02:27:42,220
When you look at it from the viewpoint
of fake news right now and Russian bots,

2408
02:27:43,480 --> 02:27:46,930
rumors are repeated by even those
who do not believe the tails.

2409
02:27:46,931 --> 02:27:48,700
There is a fascination about them.

2410
02:27:48,850 --> 02:27:53,410
The reason is that they cleverly designed
is that cleverly designed rumors give

2411
02:27:53,411 --> 02:27:58,390
expression to something deep in the
hearts of the victims, the fears,

2412
02:27:58,420 --> 02:28:01,240
suspicions,
forbidden hopes or daydreams,

2413
02:28:01,241 --> 02:28:03,970
which they hesitate to voice directly.

2414
02:28:05,350 --> 02:28:09,670
So if a commanding officer can keep
track of the rumors that are going around

2415
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:13,690
among his men, he will learn a great
deal about their current fears and hopes.

2416
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:18,490
He will have a sort of barometer that
registers the rises and falls of their

2417
02:28:18,491 --> 02:28:22,820
morale. That's a good point. People
are out. We're going to get attacked.

2418
02:28:22,880 --> 02:28:26,090
That means everyone's afraid that they're
going to get attacked or we're not

2419
02:28:26,091 --> 02:28:29,240
going to be, we're not going home on time,
okay? Everyone's concerned about that,

2420
02:28:29,270 --> 02:28:31,730
so pay attention to those rumors.

2421
02:28:33,670 --> 02:28:38,390
A rumor is not always a lie,
not always a malicious story,

2422
02:28:38,570 --> 02:28:42,770
and there are uses of rumor in war.
You can use it for disruption.

2423
02:28:42,771 --> 02:28:46,880
You can use it as a smokescreen. You can
use it for discrediting news sources.

2424
02:28:46,881 --> 02:28:49,610
This is a special technique and they
weren't doing that all the time.

2425
02:28:49,611 --> 02:28:54,020
Now there's different kinds of rumors.
There's the pipe dream rumor,

2426
02:28:54,050 --> 02:28:55,670
I thought pipe dream was a modern term.

2427
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:59,480
There's the pipe dream rumor
which depends on wishful thinking.

2428
02:29:00,440 --> 02:29:03,440
There's pleasure and believing and
repeating what you hope is true.

2429
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:08,600
The boogie man rumor is the opposite
of the pipe dream. It expresses fear,

2430
02:29:08,601 --> 02:29:12,920
not a wish.
The wedge driving rumor,

2431
02:29:13,070 --> 02:29:16,730
perhaps the most dangerous of all is the
rumor that attempts to create hostility

2432
02:29:16,731 --> 02:29:21,080
and distrust between allies or between
particular groups within a country.

2433
02:29:23,880 --> 02:29:25,770
So you have to watch out for that.

2434
02:29:27,330 --> 02:29:28,980
What makes rumor work,

2435
02:29:28,981 --> 02:29:31,200
and I think this is probably the
most important part of this section.

2436
02:29:31,230 --> 02:29:35,400
Rumors thrive on fertile soil.
What soil is fertile?

2437
02:29:36,300 --> 02:29:39,690
Lack of information about
important things, favor rumor,

2438
02:29:39,770 --> 02:29:44,220
rumors encouraged by discontent,
frustration, boredom and idleness.

2439
02:29:46,170 --> 02:29:48,450
Expectation fosters rumors.

2440
02:29:50,740 --> 02:29:55,740
Censorship since it blocks
important news favors rumor

2441
02:29:58,080 --> 02:30:02,400
and from those that you can get
to how to control rumor one,

2442
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:05,280
ensure good faith in
official communications.

2443
02:30:05,281 --> 02:30:09,660
If the public loses confidence in the
reliability of the communications of the

2444
02:30:09,661 --> 02:30:14,460
armed forces and of the press and
radio than rumors began to spread fast.

2445
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:20,490
So you've got to tell the truth to develop
faith in leaders. People can stand,

2446
02:30:20,940 --> 02:30:24,270
people can stand censorship and lack of
news when they feel they are sure that

2447
02:30:24,271 --> 02:30:27,840
they are not being told falsehoods and
that what is being held back is being

2448
02:30:27,841 --> 02:30:29,010
held back for good reason.

2449
02:30:29,250 --> 02:30:31,580
That applies to all leaders from
the president to the humble,

2450
02:30:31,581 --> 02:30:34,260
his school teacher from
the general to the corporal

2451
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:38,890
three present as many facts as possible.

2452
02:30:39,160 --> 02:30:43,960
Let the press and radio give as full and
circumstantial news as they can without

2453
02:30:43,961 --> 02:30:46,900
giving too much aid to the enemy.
But the armed forces do the same.

2454
02:30:46,901 --> 02:30:49,390
Men want facts when they
can't get facts they take.

2455
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:52,750
This is something that we all
the time in echelon front,

2456
02:30:52,751 --> 02:30:56,740
we'll go into a company and they're
having problems with the rumors and the

2457
02:30:56,741 --> 02:30:59,440
reason that they're having problems
with rumors is cause the the people.

2458
02:30:59,470 --> 02:31:03,970
The leadership is not explaining
what is happening. So there's,

2459
02:31:04,630 --> 02:31:09,100
for whatever reason, they decide they're
going to close down a location. You know,

2460
02:31:09,101 --> 02:31:12,220
maybe it's because the rent was too high
and they're gonna look for a different

2461
02:31:12,221 --> 02:31:12,581
space.

2462
02:31:12,581 --> 02:31:16,050
Maybe it's because the market had
dropped down there so much that it was a,

2463
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:20,550
it was losing money. But what's the rumor
when if you don't tell people about,

2464
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:22,400
the rumors were called out of business,

2465
02:31:22,401 --> 02:31:26,640
so they already shut down
Pleasanton and whatever the,

2466
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:28,950
we're going down find a new job.

2467
02:31:29,070 --> 02:31:33,800
So when you don't explain to
people what's going on, it's good.

2468
02:31:33,870 --> 02:31:35,850
I just had a, a guy, uh,

2469
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:41,840
leader who had to get rid of somebody
and then a turned into a big email

2470
02:31:43,800 --> 02:31:48,800
craziness where the guy that got fired
sent his closing email to everyone.

2471
02:31:51,700 --> 02:31:55,560
I'm going to miss you guys.
I'm sorry that it didn't work out.

2472
02:31:55,920 --> 02:32:00,360
I hope this doesn't bode bad for
everyone else. Like one of those, right?

2473
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:04,410
Mass email. So, and the guy going, what?
What do you think I should do? I mean,

2474
02:32:04,411 --> 02:32:08,940
this is, I shouldn't have
to like respond. And I said,

2475
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:12,600
you don't have to respond,
but if you don't respond,

2476
02:32:14,100 --> 02:32:16,680
these people are going to create. They're
going to run with everything he said.

2477
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:20,550
So craft an email and say,
hey everyone,

2478
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:25,350
sorry to see Billy. Go
Billy. We wish you luck.

2479
02:32:25,860 --> 02:32:28,560
Or maybe you don't include Billy on the
email. In fact, it probably wouldn't,

2480
02:32:28,561 --> 02:32:31,800
but sorry to see Billy go,
here's what happened.

2481
02:32:31,830 --> 02:32:35,040
Here's what unfolded here
was our financial situation.

2482
02:32:35,460 --> 02:32:40,320
We were actually losing money in
his division. Uh, not for one month,

2483
02:32:40,350 --> 02:32:44,250
not for three months,
but for 14 straight months.

2484
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:50,120
I had asked him repeatedly to conduct
or to make these changes and he hadn't

2485
02:32:51,931 --> 02:32:55,860
made any changes.
And although I like Billy as a person,

2486
02:32:56,550 --> 02:33:01,140
I couldn't sacrifice everyone
at this company. For one person,

2487
02:33:01,800 --> 02:33:06,270
what we need is to be profitable.
And with Billy in charge of that division,

2488
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:08,790
we're losing money.
And as the leader,

2489
02:33:09,060 --> 02:33:14,060
I can't allow my loyalty to one person
to Trump my loyalty to everyone here.

2490
02:33:14,850 --> 02:33:18,390
Therefore I had to let him go.
Now we've gotten that room under control.

2491
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:24,000
Next keep men and women busy.
Was it?

2492
02:33:24,001 --> 02:33:28,630
What's funny is that leader
was telling me this, you,

2493
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:32,490
I never had to do this before. Tell
everyone an email. What's going on? Oh,

2494
02:33:32,491 --> 02:33:37,110
you never had an email,
right? Email's relatively new,

2495
02:33:37,470 --> 02:33:41,310
you know, and so it's not like
somebody was sending out a mass email,

2496
02:33:41,640 --> 02:33:45,090
throwing darts at spears,
that everyone's from the,

2497
02:33:45,480 --> 02:33:50,480
from their email for keep men and women
busy prevent idleness and Ma Monotony.

2498
02:33:50,970 --> 02:33:54,210
Empty minds are easily filled
with untruths and worries.

2499
02:33:54,211 --> 02:33:59,211
Idle hands make busy tongues fight
rumor mongering campaign against rumor,

2500
02:33:59,361 --> 02:34:01,110
expose it as enemy propaganda.

2501
02:34:01,111 --> 02:34:06,111
Discredit specific rumors as inaccurate
and false caricature rumormongers.

2502
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:13,740
And this section is called psychological
warfare. Interestingly enough,

2503
02:34:13,770 --> 02:34:18,770
death can be inflicted upon the bondy's
of an enemy destruction upon property.

2504
02:34:20,080 --> 02:34:23,710
But defeat is a conquest of the mind.

2505
02:34:27,850 --> 02:34:29,620
In total war,
economic,

2506
02:34:29,621 --> 02:34:34,120
military and psychological action are
all used to bring about submission in the

2507
02:34:34,121 --> 02:34:37,540
enemy. Economic Action deprives
the enemy of vital materials.

2508
02:34:37,541 --> 02:34:40,270
Military action destroys his
armies by killing, capturing,

2509
02:34:40,271 --> 02:34:44,200
scattering the soldier smashing or
capturing the guns, tanks, planes, trucks,

2510
02:34:44,201 --> 02:34:45,034
and supplies.

2511
02:34:45,250 --> 02:34:50,250
But it is successful psychological action
that in the end it deprives the enemy

2512
02:34:50,771 --> 02:34:55,771
of his will to resist and can spoil the
individual soldier as a fighting machine

2513
02:34:56,200 --> 02:35:00,970
by removing the one thing that
makes him fight the hope of success.

2514
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:05,500
The soldier without hope
is like a tank without gas.

2515
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:09,010
When you come right down to it.
All warfare,

2516
02:35:09,220 --> 02:35:12,940
military and economic to
is psychological warfare.

2517
02:35:13,300 --> 02:35:16,540
Since willingness to
surrender is a state of mind,

2518
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:21,600
all these different means are used to
bring about a change of mind to convert

2519
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:26,500
determination to resist into
willingness to accept defeat.

2520
02:35:28,910 --> 02:35:33,170
The chief tool of psychological warfare,
the one that is most peculiar,

2521
02:35:33,730 --> 02:35:37,010
particularly psychological,
is propaganda.

2522
02:35:38,480 --> 02:35:40,790
Since propaganda tries to change opinion,

2523
02:35:40,791 --> 02:35:45,791
the people who plan propaganda have to
know all about the opinions of those.

2524
02:35:46,731 --> 02:35:47,810
They are trying to change.

2525
02:35:47,900 --> 02:35:50,840
You can't be intelligent about changing
anything unless you know what it is

2526
02:35:50,841 --> 02:35:52,820
you're trying to change.
Good point,

2527
02:35:54,530 --> 02:35:58,130
and then it talks about how you
figure out what people's opinions are.

2528
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:02,180
You have to gather that information
and how to pull for that information.

2529
02:36:02,181 --> 02:36:04,220
Then it talks about a
little bit about propaganda.

2530
02:36:04,610 --> 02:36:09,610
The truth is the best
propaganda propaganda does
not have to be dishonest or

2531
02:36:10,281 --> 02:36:10,940
lying.

2532
02:36:10,940 --> 02:36:15,440
Hitler said that a lie will be believed
if it is big enough and it may be at

2533
02:36:15,441 --> 02:36:18,320
first,
but the big lies don't stand up.

2534
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:22,100
Eventually the truth catches
them and unmasks them.

2535
02:36:22,580 --> 02:36:27,110
The goal of propaganda is always
a change in the state of mind.

2536
02:36:28,070 --> 02:36:31,610
Good propaganda always starts from a fact,

2537
02:36:34,040 --> 02:36:34,873
okay?

2538
02:36:34,970 --> 02:36:38,000
There is a formula for victory
in psychological warfare.

2539
02:36:38,270 --> 02:36:39,860
One the enemy must be weary.

2540
02:36:40,310 --> 02:36:44,420
He must be sick and tired and discouraged
to the second step in psychological

2541
02:36:44,421 --> 02:36:47,060
warfare is to turn
disillusionment into despair.

2542
02:36:47,061 --> 02:36:50,750
To convince the weary enemy
that victory is impossible.

2543
02:36:51,790 --> 02:36:54,940
The third step is to
promise something better.

2544
02:36:55,540 --> 02:36:58,310
Show him a way out the corner to beast,

2545
02:36:58,320 --> 02:37:01,330
to fights to the death unless
he sees a way of escape

2546
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:07,200
for after the creation of despair,
after the promise of something better,

2547
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:11,850
there is left there is left still one
further step for psychological warfare.

2548
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:16,910
The enemy must be led to fix
the blame on his own leaders.

2549
02:37:17,870 --> 02:37:21,980
The soldier who surrenders when he could
have fought on must have some excuse

2550
02:37:22,370 --> 02:37:26,990
and he will find it if his discipline is
broken down by his conviction that his

2551
02:37:26,991 --> 02:37:30,290
own leaders are responsible
for is unnecessary predicament.

2552
02:37:31,430 --> 02:37:35,510
That last step may come of itself,
but propaganda can help it.

2553
02:37:36,410 --> 02:37:41,410
So those are some really important
steps and if you think about them,

2554
02:37:43,790 --> 02:37:46,220
if you think about them from a
leadership perspective, they're very,

2555
02:37:46,310 --> 02:37:49,550
very powerful. If you think
about them from a business
perspective, they are very,

2556
02:37:49,551 --> 02:37:53,000
very powerful.
And when you know the offense,

2557
02:37:53,001 --> 02:37:57,410
you also have to understand the
defense against psychological warfare.

2558
02:37:57,650 --> 02:37:59,180
Number one,
don't trust the enemy.

2559
02:38:00,170 --> 02:38:04,430
Remember that broadcasts and leaflets
don't necessarily come from the sources

2560
02:38:04,431 --> 02:38:08,060
from which they claim to come from. And
by the way, that also applies to emails,

2561
02:38:08,390 --> 02:38:12,380
articles, tweets, social media posts.

2562
02:38:12,980 --> 02:38:17,750
Russian bots
be critical.

2563
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:21,920
Even though a story starts off
with what you know to be true,

2564
02:38:21,921 --> 02:38:24,950
don't trust the interpretation
that is tacked onto the truth.

2565
02:38:25,310 --> 02:38:28,580
And so don't accept first interpretation.

2566
02:38:28,581 --> 02:38:32,360
You hear about the reason the battle is
won or lost or the reason there isn't

2567
02:38:32,390 --> 02:38:34,640
any more coffee.
Wait,

2568
02:38:34,670 --> 02:38:39,410
the first story is the best propaganda
because it has no other story to overcome

2569
02:38:39,411 --> 02:38:42,620
but it is not necessarily
the best for you to believe.

2570
02:38:43,520 --> 02:38:47,480
But in general
don't trust the enemy.

2571
02:38:49,460 --> 02:38:53,690
Don't trust the enemy.
If he turns friendly,

2572
02:38:53,720 --> 02:38:57,500
fear him or better understand that he's
up to no good. If you are captured,

2573
02:38:57,501 --> 02:38:58,251
tell them just your name,

2574
02:38:58,251 --> 02:39:01,700
rank and serial number and nothing else
just because he seems friendly and well

2575
02:39:01,701 --> 02:39:04,370
meaning don't spill things
you think are unimportant.

2576
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:10,800
It wraps up with this trust only
your own leaders there for you.

2577
02:39:12,090 --> 02:39:16,290
Trust them
and be wise

2578
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:22,790
and that's kind of an interesting way
to to to finish up that book is that

2579
02:39:23,280 --> 02:39:25,680
statement.
Trust them but be wise.

2580
02:39:28,440 --> 02:39:31,480
Trust you leaders but but at the same
time be wise and you've got to pay

2581
02:39:31,481 --> 02:39:36,430
attention to that because it's
a little counter to trust,

2582
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:41,440
right? It's saying trust but be wise
and I and I actually agree with that

2583
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:49,350
question. Everything be wise
question, everything question.

2584
02:39:49,351 --> 02:39:53,040
Your leaders don't follow people blindly.
You can put your trust in them. Sure.

2585
02:39:53,041 --> 02:39:55,620
But at the same time you have to be wise.

2586
02:39:55,800 --> 02:39:58,740
Be Wise to question them,

2587
02:39:59,670 --> 02:40:02,610
be wise to try and
understand their decisions,

2588
02:40:02,611 --> 02:40:06,300
be wise enough to disobey them.

2589
02:40:07,620 --> 02:40:12,620
Should they choose to lead in a manner
that is detrimental to the mission,

2590
02:40:13,320 --> 02:40:17,860
to the strategic objectives
and to common sense. Okay.

2591
02:40:20,590 --> 02:40:21,251
And you know what,

2592
02:40:21,251 --> 02:40:25,540
you got to be wise not just about
your leaders but about everyone.

2593
02:40:25,720 --> 02:40:27,570
Seek to understand.

2594
02:40:28,850 --> 02:40:29,460
Okay.

2595
02:40:29,460 --> 02:40:32,430
Seek to understand people which you do

2596
02:40:35,200 --> 02:40:40,060
by watching them and by observing
them and by listening to them.

2597
02:40:40,061 --> 02:40:45,061
And you know one thing that we do people
do is we spend a lot of time on output.

2598
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:49,570
Yeah.

2599
02:40:49,570 --> 02:40:53,290
We are sending all the time,
we are talking all the time.

2600
02:40:54,370 --> 02:40:57,280
We are putting information
out all the time.

2601
02:40:57,580 --> 02:41:01,120
Learn to be on receive mode a little bit
more. Learn to listen a little bit more.

2602
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:06,150
Learn to capture and absorb and
utilize a what other people reveal.

2603
02:41:09,470 --> 02:41:13,880
And when you do that you'll garner
a better understanding of them,

2604
02:41:13,910 --> 02:41:16,550
of yourself, of your team, of your enemy,

2605
02:41:18,870 --> 02:41:23,870
the nature of the battle itself and
the nature of humans themselves.

2606
02:41:26,680 --> 02:41:31,680
So listen and learn and understand
so that you can become wise.

2607
02:41:31,841 --> 02:41:36,070
Because if you become wise,
then you can win.

2608
02:41:38,740 --> 02:41:43,330
And that wraps up this incredible book,

2609
02:41:43,450 --> 02:41:45,940
psychology for the fighting man,

2610
02:41:46,300 --> 02:41:48,940
what you should know
about yourself and others.

2611
02:41:52,500 --> 02:41:56,490
All right, so echo, I know, um,

2612
02:41:58,110 --> 02:42:03,110
you've got some hopefully some information
to tell us how to become a little bit

2613
02:42:03,601 --> 02:42:08,601
wiser in our movement down the path
that our movement towards winning in all

2614
02:42:09,931 --> 02:42:14,820
aspects of life in this total war that
we are fighting on a daily basis in all

2615
02:42:14,821 --> 02:42:16,720
directions. Yes sir. I do.

2616
02:42:17,550 --> 02:42:18,380
We got,
okay.

2617
02:42:18,380 --> 02:42:22,580
Do you do to is one of the many ways and
now what kind of gear are we going to

2618
02:42:22,581 --> 02:42:23,414
get when we

2619
02:42:24,210 --> 02:42:27,560
do Jujitsu, foraging and
g? That's the answer.

2620
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:32,990
Did people have not been asking me that
recently? That's good. That's good.

2621
02:42:33,350 --> 02:42:35,780
Well, hopefully it's good.
Hopefully that signifies

2622
02:42:36,070 --> 02:42:37,870
that. They already know. They know. Yeah.

2623
02:42:38,140 --> 02:42:40,150
Hopefully it doesn't signify
that people are slowing down.

2624
02:42:40,151 --> 02:42:42,160
Starting to do actually,
which you know what?

2625
02:42:42,161 --> 02:42:46,200
I know from different input that
I'm receiving because I'm out.

2626
02:42:46,210 --> 02:42:49,990
Resigned on receiving Loredo
good that people are starting.

2627
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:54,070
Did you still just finished my first
Jujitsu class got rolled out? Yeah.

2628
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:55,460
Just finished my Jujitsu class.

2629
02:42:55,490 --> 02:42:58,990
I'm just finished my first stripe
on that white belt. Oh yeah.

2630
02:42:58,991 --> 02:43:02,080
So people are getting on the
path for sure. Yeah. And Stain,

2631
02:43:02,081 --> 02:43:05,370
cause I'm hearing about blue belts.
No. Yeah. And we're in that mode.

2632
02:43:05,371 --> 02:43:09,400
We've been in that mode for for like
maybe a year almost where it goes.

2633
02:43:09,401 --> 02:43:11,990
People are starting to get blue
belt started to see blue belts. He

2634
02:43:11,990 --> 02:43:16,060
merged stripes are sure
you are the pro, the, yeah.

2635
02:43:16,061 --> 02:43:18,100
We're seeing blue belts were three years.

2636
02:43:18,101 --> 02:43:20,320
A little over three years
deep in the podcast.

2637
02:43:20,770 --> 02:43:25,770
We should have our first
hopefully potential Jocko podcast.

2638
02:43:26,780 --> 02:43:31,320
Blackbelt within seven years
is my prediction. Yeah. Yeah.

2639
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:35,620
Right. Yeah. I would say average
10 years. How long did it take?

2640
02:43:35,650 --> 02:43:37,870
Maybe it took a few months before
people started going, okay,

2641
02:43:37,871 --> 02:43:40,870
I'm going to start this Jujitsu stuff
cause he's guys won't stop talking about

2642
02:43:40,871 --> 02:43:45,460
it. But I was going at
wrestling tournaments. This is,

2643
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:46,593
this was awesome.

2644
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:51,840
Going to wrestling tournaments and having
kids that are freshmen in high school.

2645
02:43:52,690 --> 02:43:56,080
So there are 1314 years old.
Guess what started in grappling?

2646
02:43:57,410 --> 02:44:00,130
A little jar called wait,
no little book called way of the warrior.

2647
02:44:01,660 --> 02:44:05,260
The warrior kid got them on the path and
so now they started that when they were

2648
02:44:05,261 --> 02:44:08,260
11 years old, two, three years ago
and they read way of the warrior kid.

2649
02:44:08,290 --> 02:44:12,610
I want to learn how to wrestle and
then the kids come up to me. Hey Sir,

2650
02:44:13,510 --> 02:44:14,150
are you all good?

2651
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:19,150
My name's Freddy and I started
wrestling because I got into Jujitsu,

2652
02:44:20,410 --> 02:44:22,330
so thank you.

2653
02:44:22,990 --> 02:44:27,340
So that's one of the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time because why?

2654
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:30,820
Because I know that that kid is going
to have like legitimately better life

2655
02:44:30,821 --> 02:44:35,230
because they know how to do Jujitsu
and wrestle. Their life will be better.

2656
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:40,300
So if you're doing Jujitsu,
you get an origin.

2657
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:45,310
He getting origin g made in America and
designed specifically for [inaudible]?

2658
02:44:48,460 --> 02:44:53,140
No, for judo, no for hop. Kido? Nope.

2659
02:44:53,380 --> 02:44:58,090
Designed for one thing. Brazilian
Jujitsu. That's what it's made for. And

2660
02:45:01,060 --> 02:45:05,560
by black belt by,
by Jujitsu.

2661
02:45:05,590 --> 02:45:09,430
Black belt people made it.
That's legit.

2662
02:45:11,110 --> 02:45:14,230
Also got some other clothes up
there. T shirts, sweatshirts.

2663
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:15,880
We'll working on boots.

2664
02:45:16,360 --> 02:45:20,170
I can't talk about that yet because
then people will be on me for the next

2665
02:45:20,171 --> 02:45:23,830
whatever as we try and get we can do,
we have the machinery in place,

2666
02:45:24,280 --> 02:45:26,530
we've got models being built.
I have a pair,

2667
02:45:26,531 --> 02:45:28,120
I know you don't have a
pair cause you're not quite,

2668
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:31,480
you know on the inner inner circle.
Yeah.

2669
02:45:32,410 --> 02:45:36,400
You look really despondent when I
said that. That's okay. I broke,

2670
02:45:36,401 --> 02:45:39,010
I broke his arm anyway.
Oh kiss for you later.

2671
02:45:41,480 --> 02:45:45,440
You get all these things at origin,
main.com.

2672
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:49,880
Other stuff on there like supplements,
most important supplements.

2673
02:45:50,470 --> 02:45:54,110
I'd lift weights, whatever.
And I've always had probably

2674
02:45:54,420 --> 02:45:57,840
like maybe 15 years I would say.

2675
02:45:58,230 --> 02:46:01,000
Always said like this elbow,
like I wouldn't call it tendonitis,

2676
02:46:01,030 --> 02:46:05,110
although I have had tendonitis
in my elbow. So can you
just an elbow thing? Yeah.

2677
02:46:06,010 --> 02:46:11,010
And so when I first got in joint warfare
and the oil go egg Gwyn away complete

2678
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:16,180
right. Went away completely. So recently
I got like heavy back into limb.

2679
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:20,150
Like man I can, you can go right.
So it sort of starts to come back.

2680
02:46:20,151 --> 02:46:22,430
But now it's like at this
phase where all feet,

2681
02:46:22,431 --> 02:46:26,260
like right now if I tried to do like
a close grip pushup or something like,

2682
02:46:26,510 --> 02:46:28,940
like right now in this
cold room I'll feel it,

2683
02:46:29,450 --> 02:46:34,450
but the amount of sets that I have to do
to warm it up or now reduced to one one

2684
02:46:35,270 --> 02:46:38,120
usually it was every single set of more,
it was like three,

2685
02:46:38,121 --> 02:46:40,760
four sets of warmup that my first set
I could feel it but I could get over.

2686
02:46:40,910 --> 02:46:44,300
It was like that. So it's like, and I'm
getting older, I'm not getting younger.

2687
02:46:44,800 --> 02:46:48,000
I know it seems obvious, but given
the way my elbow feels, you know,

2688
02:46:48,170 --> 02:46:49,003
not that obvious.

2689
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:53,420
Reviews on people for
joint warfare are awesome.

2690
02:46:54,050 --> 02:46:55,070
People are,

2691
02:46:55,310 --> 02:46:59,660
they get that where something has been
bothering them for so long and they get

2692
02:46:59,661 --> 02:47:03,950
on the joint warfare for all on
the Krill oil and you feel good.

2693
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:07,040
That's what makes it,
in my opinion,

2694
02:47:07,070 --> 02:47:10,460
the most important supplement or we
kind of something allows you to work

2695
02:47:12,290 --> 02:47:17,270
harder. So true. So yeah, joint warfare,
boom, get down one super krill oil,

2696
02:47:17,480 --> 02:47:21,410
some added antioxidants in there.
And then discipline, which is,

2697
02:47:22,250 --> 02:47:23,660
it's a combination of two things.

2698
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:28,960
It's a little physical energy boost and
a mental cognitive increasing capacity

2699
02:47:30,501 --> 02:47:32,630
to think you.
So that's discipline.

2700
02:47:32,780 --> 02:47:35,630
The drink discipline go is that,

2701
02:47:36,230 --> 02:47:40,540
but it's in the form of a pill.
So or wait,

2702
02:47:40,550 --> 02:47:43,130
they call it a capsule
capsule. Yeah, it's a capsule.

2703
02:47:43,910 --> 02:47:48,140
I told Brian at orange little,
hey man,

2704
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:53,900
discipline. I'm addicted to the
drink, which I love it. Thank you.

2705
02:47:54,200 --> 02:47:58,070
Um, for, for helping me
get this to the world.

2706
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:01,370
However, if I'm going to go up
on stage and talk for two hours,

2707
02:48:01,371 --> 02:48:05,640
I can't pound two bottles of discipline.
You know why?

2708
02:48:05,720 --> 02:48:09,620
It's a real simple reason.
It is what it is.

2709
02:48:09,650 --> 02:48:11,050
It's a biological reason.
Yeah.

2710
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:14,570
Drink two liters of water and you're
going to have to go to the bathroom.

2711
02:48:14,750 --> 02:48:18,770
Yes sir. I don't want to have
to stop. Hey, hold on a minute.

2712
02:48:19,010 --> 02:48:22,160
Crowd of 700 people. I'm just going
to go hit the head real quick.

2713
02:48:22,190 --> 02:48:25,370
That's not happened yet.
So took the discipline formula.

2714
02:48:25,700 --> 02:48:27,320
We made it into a capsule.

2715
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:32,480
Now I can just pop three
discipline when I'm going to need,

2716
02:48:34,100 --> 02:48:37,730
when are we going to need that
little edge to edge? You don't,

2717
02:48:37,731 --> 02:48:39,590
as Jason Gardner put it to me,

2718
02:48:40,370 --> 02:48:44,780
the word searching gets reduced to zero
like you don't word search anymore in

2719
02:48:44,781 --> 02:48:48,080
your head. You know when you're saying
stuff that still is there. Okay.

2720
02:48:48,081 --> 02:48:52,070
Then there's that energy
drink, one version, right?

2721
02:48:52,071 --> 02:48:55,550
The energy drink is coming is not out yet.
Well,

2722
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:59,770
the video with JP, yes.
Origin, boom. Yeah.

2723
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:03,710
Clearly the energy drink is made.
It is made,

2724
02:49:03,800 --> 02:49:07,230
but it's not in production yet,
and I'm going to go into why. Well,

2725
02:49:07,260 --> 02:49:11,490
the reason why it's not in production is
because of the way we are producing it,

2726
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:15,780
which is a way that no one else is doing
because the bottom line is there's all

2727
02:49:15,781 --> 02:49:17,340
kinds of, what'd you call it? Energy.

2728
02:49:17,341 --> 02:49:19,540
There's all kinds of energy
drinks out there right now, right?

2729
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:20,820
They're not good for you.

2730
02:49:21,060 --> 02:49:24,360
The closest thing you can get to an energy
drink that's good for you is actually

2731
02:49:24,361 --> 02:49:27,570
Jocko white tea. That's the closest
thing you can get because it tastes good.

2732
02:49:27,840 --> 02:49:29,610
It's got some caffeine.
Some antioxidants,

2733
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:33,420
we're taking that to the next
level with the discipline,

2734
02:49:33,510 --> 02:49:36,180
go ready to drink in a can.

2735
02:49:36,480 --> 02:49:39,840
It tastes delicious and
it's actually good for you.

2736
02:49:40,440 --> 02:49:43,620
This is the difference.
So that'll be out,

2737
02:49:44,310 --> 02:49:47,310
I'm guessing we're probably not
looking for another two months,

2738
02:49:47,311 --> 02:49:50,730
so no reason to get all excited yet. I'll
let you know when it was all out there.

2739
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:52,050
In the meantime,

2740
02:49:52,350 --> 02:49:56,760
the discipline powder is
a good variant for now.

2741
02:49:57,180 --> 02:50:01,440
But yeah, the discipline going to
Cannes, it's really, it's nailed.

2742
02:50:01,441 --> 02:50:05,840
It nailed it for samples.
They're gone. I mean,

2743
02:50:05,860 --> 02:50:08,190
I'm down,
I don't drink energy drinks,

2744
02:50:08,191 --> 02:50:11,100
but if there's like one there that
like I know it's going to taste good.

2745
02:50:11,101 --> 02:50:15,280
I'm Kinda, I'm Kinda, I like those, you
know? So that one was like, ah. Yeah.

2746
02:50:15,690 --> 02:50:19,620
And that's the thing is that it
tastes good, which is awesome.

2747
02:50:19,770 --> 02:50:23,940
It's actually good for you. You
know, there's no, it's just so

2748
02:50:25,440 --> 02:50:26,040
good to go.

2749
02:50:26,040 --> 02:50:31,040
Also got milk and you wanna get on the
milk train for some additional protein in

2750
02:50:31,351 --> 02:50:34,110
addition to your Ribeye steaks.
And here's the thing,

2751
02:50:34,310 --> 02:50:37,890
in addition to your Tomahawk Ribeye
steak. Well yeah, he did the thing,

2752
02:50:37,891 --> 02:50:42,810
you need additional protein if you're
working out. Do you do that straight up?

2753
02:50:42,840 --> 02:50:45,390
Otherwise your buddy, what eats
itself and you want that to happen.

2754
02:50:45,391 --> 02:50:48,360
And I'll tell you what, even if you don't
need additional protein, you know what?

2755
02:50:48,361 --> 02:50:50,760
You need dessert.
Yeah.

2756
02:50:50,790 --> 02:50:55,260
So luckily milk is its own.
Why?

2757
02:50:55,261 --> 02:50:56,760
What is more?
What does this mean?

2758
02:50:56,790 --> 02:51:01,790
It means really tasty nectar that is going
to make you stronger and you can have

2759
02:51:02,851 --> 02:51:05,220
it for dessert.
When you get done having dessert,

2760
02:51:05,280 --> 02:51:08,370
you won't get done with it and think,
oh, I still want some ice cream. No,

2761
02:51:08,371 --> 02:51:11,130
you'd be like, I'm done with it and I'm
done and I'm feeling great. We're good.

2762
02:51:11,920 --> 02:51:13,080
Okay.
So I made this,

2763
02:51:13,110 --> 02:51:17,880
here's a new little dish in my little,

2764
02:51:18,180 --> 02:51:19,460
I dunno, whatever. Yeah.

2765
02:51:20,610 --> 02:51:25,560
So I go egg white omelet with like,

2766
02:51:25,930 --> 02:51:28,690
I'll take like leftovers can omelet.
No.

2767
02:51:29,970 --> 02:51:34,920
So you know, for example, my wife made
pot roast, right? So it's like pot roast.

2768
02:51:34,921 --> 02:51:38,130
There's little carrots in there. You
know, there's potatoes in there. Yes.

2769
02:51:38,460 --> 02:51:42,100
So I'll take some leftover pot roast
and I'll make an egg white omelette with

2770
02:51:42,101 --> 02:51:45,510
the pot roast, right? It seems kind of
what I, but whatever the leftovers is,

2771
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:48,630
most part, I'll make an Omelette with
it. And so I made it and it's good.

2772
02:51:48,631 --> 02:51:52,070
That's like good nutrients right there.
That's a solid like post workout,

2773
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:56,880
whatever tastes good too. And then
you know, no sugar, no, you know,

2774
02:51:56,881 --> 02:52:01,530
it's like legit and tastes really good.
So I pound, that was not last night.

2775
02:52:01,531 --> 02:52:04,410
The night before look pound
that. I'm like, man, I'm so,

2776
02:52:04,411 --> 02:52:07,540
not only did I get a good,
healthy,

2777
02:52:07,990 --> 02:52:10,330
delicious little meal that I made,
I'm like,

2778
02:52:10,331 --> 02:52:14,860
you know how you have say pain in the
mood for some dessert and in a way,

2779
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:19,250
in a weak mind, in a matter
of speaking, in a week, man,

2780
02:52:19,350 --> 02:52:23,820
you can be like, hey, I had such a
healthy dinner. I can kind of, you know,

2781
02:52:24,270 --> 02:52:26,490
exercise some freedom on
the dessert little bit.

2782
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:30,310
But I mixed up the milk.

2783
02:52:31,080 --> 02:52:35,150
Double Win when bone stayed on the
discipline path and when your foot,

2784
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:36,270
when you're kind of full like that.

2785
02:52:36,300 --> 02:52:39,900
Sometimes you eat a giant steak but you're
still, even though you're pretty full,

2786
02:52:40,200 --> 02:52:43,830
you want to have a little dessert.
Yeah. Little one. Scoop hitter. Yeah,

2787
02:52:43,890 --> 02:52:48,890
my middle one scoop hitter scoops and
lately I will say I've been mixing less

2788
02:52:49,981 --> 02:52:52,520
milk and more Malke.
Okay. Yes. It's thicker,

2789
02:52:52,530 --> 02:52:56,970
like oily and it's so good. It's like
a little, it's a straight up milkshake.

2790
02:52:57,270 --> 02:53:02,070
Get that hit her as my brother feel.
Von would say true.

2791
02:53:02,130 --> 02:53:03,510
Also warrior kid milk.

2792
02:53:03,630 --> 02:53:08,630
That's for the kids and think it's for
kids until you try that strawberry that

2793
02:53:09,130 --> 02:53:13,050
too, but that's a good on this
sweat. Strawberry chocolate. Is it?

2794
02:53:13,051 --> 02:53:15,540
That's the only two right
now. Right now. Yeah. Yeah,

2795
02:53:15,870 --> 02:53:19,230
and then the strawberry that's going
to go to the regular pretty soon it's

2796
02:53:19,231 --> 02:53:24,060
coming. We're working on it.
He's also, Jack was a store.

2797
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:27,240
You going to stay on the path.
Good. Of course stay on the path,

2798
02:53:27,241 --> 02:53:29,760
but if you want to represent
while you're on the path,

2799
02:53:29,761 --> 02:53:32,370
we've got some shirts for you.
If you want discipline equals freedom,

2800
02:53:32,670 --> 02:53:37,410
it's a good one. He gets two versions
of that by the way. All the new ones,

2801
02:53:37,440 --> 02:53:39,810
you know. Yes. And
they're both in the game.

2802
02:53:39,890 --> 02:53:44,880
Fully good ways to represent some hoodies
on. They're also more rash guards.

2803
02:53:44,910 --> 02:53:48,060
So you want to represent and people
have been representing tournaments,

2804
02:53:48,061 --> 02:53:52,380
competitions with get after it, you know,
on the rash guard. These are all, yeah,

2805
02:53:52,460 --> 02:53:56,730
so really good. Yet when you see
people straight representing Oh yeah.

2806
02:53:56,790 --> 02:54:01,140
In the competition, big time.
Um, a lot of cool. So again,

2807
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:03,653
hats,

2808
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:07,820
flex, fit hat, uh, you know, I think
we might discontinue the trucker hats,

2809
02:54:07,821 --> 02:54:10,790
but I see what it,

2810
02:54:11,360 --> 02:54:15,110
that w we have chapters has
zero credit for selling that,

2811
02:54:16,250 --> 02:54:20,900
that was so bad. Well, we have
both truckers had and flex.

2812
02:54:20,901 --> 02:54:25,000
It had also hoodies. Oh eight already
said he's anyway, gone there. Jocko,

2813
02:54:25,010 --> 02:54:26,870
store.com.
If he likes something,

2814
02:54:26,930 --> 02:54:31,570
get something represent and support.
It's true.

2815
02:54:31,600 --> 02:54:36,560
It's also yourself, Jocko white
tea. Okay. Any it can, yes. Okay.

2816
02:54:37,530 --> 02:54:38,190
Okay.

2817
02:54:38,190 --> 02:54:42,570
Little bit of caffeine in there.
Antioxidants deadlift 8,000 pounds.

2818
02:54:42,900 --> 02:54:47,180
That's good. It's good. Like my wife
Dead Lifts 8,000 Times, you know?

2819
02:54:48,240 --> 02:54:52,470
Um, more of a mild taste compared
to the energy drink at night.

2820
02:54:52,480 --> 02:54:57,230
I know you mean energy drink in
general. No. Your, your [inaudible].

2821
02:54:57,930 --> 02:55:01,410
She would not call that an
energy drink. I wouldn't, yeah,

2822
02:55:01,470 --> 02:55:05,630
I would call it something. I
would call it discipline. Go.

2823
02:55:06,140 --> 02:55:08,630
Yeah, I dunno. I think, yeah.

2824
02:55:08,631 --> 02:55:11,800
Well the jury is still out it now
cause it's kind of an energy drink.

2825
02:55:11,820 --> 02:55:14,120
The problem is energy. You don't
want the not good for you. Yeah.

2826
02:55:14,121 --> 02:55:18,380
You don't want the stigma. Energy
are literally bad for you. Yeah.

2827
02:55:19,650 --> 02:55:22,910
We'll think about talent nonetheless.
Jocko white tea, not an energy drink.

2828
02:55:22,911 --> 02:55:26,760
It's actual t sort of
a certified organic u.

2829
02:55:26,810 --> 02:55:29,970
S d a no,

2830
02:55:30,590 --> 02:55:35,300
certified organic. So yeah, you can get
that one in a can or what do you call it?

2831
02:55:36,140 --> 02:55:41,040
Loose? No, that's not loose leaf. Dry in
the bags or whatever. That's a good one.

2832
02:55:41,130 --> 02:55:44,580
You also subscribe to the podcast.
If you don't subscribe to the podcast,

2833
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:46,010
then echo's going to keep telling you.

2834
02:55:46,130 --> 02:55:49,550
If I don't tell you as quickly as
possible to subscribe to the podcast to do

2835
02:55:49,551 --> 02:55:50,020
that.

2836
02:55:50,020 --> 02:55:55,020
And don't forget about the warrior kid
podcast because your kids need to be

2837
02:55:58,101 --> 02:56:02,120
shown the path.
And I hate to say this,

2838
02:56:03,470 --> 02:56:06,820
not by you. Well know. In
addition to you telling them,

2839
02:56:06,860 --> 02:56:08,720
in addition to you
trying to convince them,

2840
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:11,120
because if you remember
when you were a kid,

2841
02:56:11,150 --> 02:56:13,520
you didn't want to listen to your dad.
You didn't want to listen to your mom.

2842
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,730
You kind of always thought, well,
he may be just, I might look,

2843
02:56:16,731 --> 02:56:17,960
I might only be 11 years old,

2844
02:56:17,961 --> 02:56:21,280
but I think I know a little bit
better than my dad for sure.

2845
02:56:21,280 --> 02:56:23,630
You think very least he don't understand.

2846
02:56:23,960 --> 02:56:27,650
He's still the Jake can talk to your kid,
get him on the path,

2847
02:56:27,860 --> 02:56:28,850
let them know what's up.

2848
02:56:29,020 --> 02:56:33,260

2869
02:57:51,290 --> 02:57:53,620
So you want some info on their bulletin.

2870
02:57:53,640 --> 02:57:58,490
That's where he can get a lot of good
stuff on there going on at.com/jocko I

2871
02:57:58,491 --> 02:58:02,040
wrote a bunch of books.
If you want to get the books,

2872
02:58:02,310 --> 02:58:07,080
go to Jocko podcast.com and
then click on the various books.

2873
02:58:07,950 --> 02:58:12,180
Mikey and the dragon is a book
that I wrote. It's for little kids,

2874
02:58:12,360 --> 02:58:17,360
but everyone gets something out of it
and it's a cool story that rhymes you and

2875
02:58:20,101 --> 02:58:25,020
it's delivered very eloquently.
If, I don't know if eloquent,

2876
02:58:25,021 --> 02:58:27,320
the word eloquent is even compatible with,

2877
02:58:27,370 --> 02:58:31,650
with you as as a whole concept
or whatever, but I will,

2878
02:58:31,651 --> 02:58:33,990
I'll use it.
Very eloquent check.

2879
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:39,200
So Mike and the dragons for kids also for
kids way the warrior kid and weigh the

2880
02:58:39,691 --> 02:58:43,470
warrior kid too, which is called
Mark's mission and also waive the war,

2881
02:58:43,471 --> 02:58:48,471
your kid three which is
called where there's a whale
and that book is coming out

2882
02:58:50,610 --> 02:58:51,480
in the spring.

2883
02:58:51,750 --> 02:58:56,640
Get your kid these books because they
will point them in the right direction on

2884
02:58:56,641 --> 02:58:57,360
so many things.

2885
02:58:57,360 --> 02:59:02,360
I wish I had these books when I was a
kid so badly and I hope that the kids,

2886
02:59:03,360 --> 02:59:07,800
you know, read these books and get
themselves on the path and if an adult,

2887
02:59:07,801 --> 02:59:09,180
you know,
needs to get on the path,

2888
02:59:09,540 --> 02:59:11,400
give them the discipline
equals freedom field manual,

2889
02:59:12,960 --> 02:59:14,790
which tells people how to get after it.

2890
02:59:15,420 --> 02:59:18,060
Everybody needs to know how to
get after it. In my opinion.

2891
02:59:19,290 --> 02:59:23,820
It's a good little daily read.
It's not a normal book.

2892
02:59:24,660 --> 02:59:28,050
It's different. Yes, very
different. So check that one out.

2893
02:59:28,051 --> 02:59:30,810
And then of course there
is extreme ownership.

2894
02:59:30,811 --> 02:59:35,811
The first book that I wrote
with my brother Leif Babin
and also we just released

2895
02:59:36,031 --> 02:59:39,630
last year dichotomy of leadership and

2896
02:59:41,370 --> 02:59:45,480
I'm starting to think there's people
starting to comment that dichotomy of

2897
02:59:45,481 --> 02:59:50,481
leadership is now starting to emerge
from the shadow of his older brother.

2898
02:59:52,080 --> 02:59:55,290
And we're starting to think that dichotomy
of leadership is going to be a little

2899
02:59:55,291 --> 02:59:59,190
bit more yoked, little bit
more jacked. And may you serp,

2900
03:00:00,210 --> 03:00:05,040
the older brother may end up being
the one that people really dial into.

2901
03:00:05,070 --> 03:00:08,670
So check them out.
Also speaking of books,

2902
03:00:08,700 --> 03:00:10,140
if you want this book,

2903
03:00:10,170 --> 03:00:15,170
psychology for the fighting man or
any of the books that Jocko covers,

2904
03:00:16,410 --> 03:00:21,240
got them on a page on Jocko, podcast.com
on the top books from episodes.

2905
03:00:21,240 --> 03:00:23,430
That's what it says on the top
menu books from an episodes. Boom.

2906
03:00:23,431 --> 03:00:26,910
I got 'em by episode. Boom,
available right there. Get them.

2907
03:00:27,030 --> 03:00:31,800
If you want to know my reading, my
reading list, I recommended reading list.

2908
03:00:31,890 --> 03:00:35,280
That's my recommended reading list.
That's it.

2909
03:00:35,490 --> 03:00:40,110
It's Jocko podcast.com go to the little
tab that says books from the episodes.

2910
03:00:40,170 --> 03:00:44,520
Sure. Yeah, and then you can get them,
so that's that. That's a bunch of books.

2911
03:00:44,880 --> 03:00:47,880
Books that I've written,
other books that you can be educated by.

2912
03:00:47,881 --> 03:00:50,880
Books that have educated me.

Dave Burke, Flint Cochran,

2915
03:00:56,881 --> 03:01:01,881
Mike's Really Mike [inaudible]
and we are@echelonfront.com

2916
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:10,230
also, we have the monster coming
up 2019 may 23 and 24 in Chicago,

2917
03:01:10,260 --> 03:01:13,720
September 19 to 20 and Denver,
December 4th and fifth and Sydney

2918
03:01:15,610 --> 03:01:18,430
go to extreme ownership.com to register.

2919
03:01:18,550 --> 03:01:22,510
Every event that we
have done has sold out.

2920
03:01:22,600 --> 03:01:26,650
These are absolutely going to sell it too.
And I thought,

2921
03:01:27,100 --> 03:01:29,380
I just talked to our ops director Jamie,

2922
03:01:30,040 --> 03:01:34,420
and she's like the hour we're ahead on
sales. And I was like, cool, it's glad,

2923
03:01:34,421 --> 03:01:37,180
I'm glad we got so many more seats.
And she's like, what? And I go,

2924
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:41,950
well don't we have, don't we
have, you know, 1200 seats
or something? She's like, no.

2925
03:01:42,160 --> 03:01:43,920
The biggest we could get,
it's like,

2926
03:01:44,200 --> 03:01:46,480
it's still basically the
same size as San Francisco,

2927
03:01:47,070 --> 03:01:50,050
seven 50 or something like that.
So it's gonna sell out very quickly.

2928
03:01:50,500 --> 03:01:55,120
So if you want to come, please just
go and get on it. The F online,

2929
03:01:56,080 --> 03:01:58,970
online interactive training,
leadership training that

2930
03:02:00,550 --> 03:02:04,570
we did this because echelon front

2931
03:02:06,130 --> 03:02:11,020
is not big enough and cannot grow quickly
enough to train everyone that requests

2932
03:02:11,050 --> 03:02:11,883
training.

2933
03:02:11,920 --> 03:02:16,920
So what we did to scale what we do is put
it what we do into an online platform,

2934
03:02:20,320 --> 03:02:22,600
interactive,
very engaging.

2935
03:02:23,500 --> 03:02:28,500
It's what we do with companies and now
we can do it through the computer screen,

2936
03:02:29,560 --> 03:02:33,550
so e f online,
go and check that out

2937

and finally f Overwatch's where we take
proven leaders from the battlefield,

2938
03:02:42,071 --> 03:02:47,071
from special operations and combat
aviation and we embed them into companies

2939
03:02:49,270 --> 03:02:53,320
where they can then help
that company lead and win.

Echo is an echo.

2949
03:03:33,880 --> 03:03:37,810
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink and
of course thanks to all our military

2950
03:03:37,811 --> 03:03:40,390
personnel for standing
watch around the world.

2951
03:03:40,391 --> 03:03:45,391
You protect our freedom
and we are indebted to you.

2952
03:03:46,271 --> 03:03:49,150
We are also indebted to our police
and law enforcement, firefighters,

2953
03:03:49,151 --> 03:03:53,230
paramedics and EMT correctional officer's
border patrol, all first responders.

2954
03:03:53,231 --> 03:03:57,590
You keep us safe and we thank you for
your service and sacrifice as well.

2955
03:03:57,770 --> 03:04:00,230
And to everyone out there listening,

2956
03:04:00,470 --> 03:04:05,470
remember how many lessons this book gives
about the way we think about the way

2957
03:04:08,661 --> 03:04:12,860
we act, about the way we follow in
about the way we lead it. And remember

2958
03:04:14,590 --> 03:04:17,020
that a good leader doesn't handle his man.

2959
03:04:17,021 --> 03:04:20,470
A good leader handles himself.

2960
03:04:22,930 --> 03:04:27,580
That's some of the best advice for
leadership and life I've heard in a long

2961
03:04:27,581 --> 03:04:31,600
time. So follow it. Handle
yourself. Keep yourself in check.

2962
03:04:31,601 --> 03:04:35,860
Keep yourself on the path.
Lead yourself so that you okay.

2963
03:04:36,250 --> 03:04:40,970
Become a person that others will follow
and they will follow you on that path.

2964
03:04:41,960 --> 03:04:45,770
The path of discipline,
the path of righteousness,

2965
03:04:45,980 --> 03:04:50,780
and the path that leads
to peace and freedom.

2966
03:04:52,600 --> 03:04:53,680
So until next time,

2967
03:04:54,640 --> 03:04:57,760
this is echo and Jocko out.
