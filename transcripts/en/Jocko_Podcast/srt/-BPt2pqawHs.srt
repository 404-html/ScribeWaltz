1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,950
This is Jocko podcast number
one 46 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,620
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,090
And I wanted to kind of delve into and
slash explain some conversations that

4
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:22,020
I've had lately. Sure.
With a couple of people.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,110
And actually I think the numbers
increased now cause now I've had this

6
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:27,770
conversation with a few people and I'm,

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,960
I am feeling like I need to kind of
share this idea with kind of with more

8
00:00:34,861 --> 00:00:36,510
people.
I guess at this point

9
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,990
it's kind of a discussion that
applies to everyone at some level,

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,280
sort of about what you are and about
who you are and about where you been and

11
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,640
about where you're going.
So that's a pretty broad topic I think.

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,100
Suffice it to say

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,460
now in order to convey this properly,

14
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:05,310
I'm going to try and set up
some visuals in your head.

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,720
Could you kind of kind of see this right?
Graphs,

16
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,490
whatever charts,

17
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,110
all right diagrams and I'm going to try
and keep them simple but pretty straight

18
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:23,880
forward. Um, here we go. We're going
to grade things when a great things,

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,000
one to 10 because that's sort of the
stamp. Is that the standard? Yes.

20
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:30,750
I mean I guess you'd go a, B, c,
d, F, but we're not doing that.

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,500
We're going one to ten one being
the worst, 10 being the best,

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,680
one being the least, 10 being the
most, that type of thing. Okay,

23
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,120
so so you have a chart,

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,360
a picture in your head at the bottom of
the chart is a one that's the lowest.

25
00:01:42,361 --> 00:01:45,720
That's the worst at the chop is 10
that's the highest. That's the most. Now,

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,130
the first chart that we're going
to talk about, it measures talent.

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,470
Now what's different about this chart
is this is not just talking about a

28
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,100
particular talent.

29
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,090
This is talking about every possible
type of talent that you as an individual

30
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:04,050
human being have,
and it's consolidating that.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,560
All those different types of
talents into one giant score,

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,700
one holistic score,

33
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,900
10 at the top or one at the bottom.

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,090
So this is, this is everything
that you are as a person,

35
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,980
how smart you are.
The only,

36
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,130
the only thing is that everything that
you are as a person that you are given

37
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,020
naturally, right? Yeah. So there's
a baseline of how smart you are,

38
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:33,720
so how intelligent you are. Now
we know you can work, get smarter,

39
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,721
but we're just talking to baseline how
how charismatic you are as a person,

40
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:42,630
how well you read people's emotions,
how athletic you are

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,580
and that grades you can grade to all
different types of athleticism and their

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,710
strength cause some people
are naturally strong,

43
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,630
some people are naturally flexible.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,570
Some people have natural
cardiovascular endurance, right?

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,760
You would get a certain
level of that naturally.

46
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:59,110
Of course we know people can work hard,
you can improve some of that,

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,740
but we're just talking your
natural talent healthy.

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,080
That's sort of a talent sort of like some
people are born healthier than others.

49
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,340
No doubt about it.
How good looking you are.

50
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,100
You ever seen those little like,

51
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,090
I don't know if their psychological
experiments but they put like the faces in

52
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:24,040
front of the babies and the babies
pick the one that looks nicer to them,

53
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,890
has to do with a symmetry,

54
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,340
symmetry and ratios and
stuff like that. So, so that,

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,520
that's a talent thing that
you're getting and natural.

56
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,200
Your natural body composition.
Right.

57
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,170
Some people are born a little bit
with a little bit more fat on them.

58
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,120
Some people are born with a
little bit more muscle on them.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,160
Some people are born with the skin and
bones. Right. You get everything. Yeah.

60
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,690
Again,
I know you can work on some of those,

61
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:54,691
but we're talking about what you got out
of the gate from your Creator or nature

62
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,400
or wherever you think you got it from.

63
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,460
So at the top of that chart, I don't
know who's at the top of that chart.

64
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,820
Uh, maybe, I mean there's people, there's,

65
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,510
there's a bunch of people that would
crank towards the top of that chart.

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,940
So who's up there? Well. Yeah,

67
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,830
ultimately hard to tell cause you know
what you to know what was given to him or

68
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,070
what, but look at them, you know,

69
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,230
to just says someone as a whole.
Yeah,

70
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,570
the rock character type character,
Delaney, the Rock, he's charismatic,

71
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:32,710
he's a good athlete, really
good athlete. He's tall, he's,

72
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,790
he's got a good acting skill, which I'm
again, did he work hard for these things?

73
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,730
We better, we better give the rocks and
credit or we're going to hear from him.

74
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:42,910
But I worked for all that, but
hey, he's given some natural stuff.

75
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,770
That's a very good one. Uh, Tom
Brady, right? Yes. He's smart.

76
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:51,060
He's a good athlete. He's, you know,

77
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:56,240
got some leadership skills. So he's got
some, some, some natural gifts that are,

78
00:04:56,241 --> 00:04:58,480
again, does he work hard? We're
not taking that away from him,

79
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,640
but you're born with some stuff, GSP
maybe. Right. Just be really good athlete,

80
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,420
smart guy, you know, level headed.

81
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,610
He's a very talented guy.
So there you go.

82
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,230
You take that chart. You look at that
chart, the one to 10 where's the,

83
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,570
where those, but where's the rock?
He's like a 9.6 he's up there. Yeah.

84
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,850
And then you ask yourself,
where are you on that chart?

85
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,160
Where are you on that chart?

86
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,190
And I'm asked quite a few people this
and we're still talking naturally.

87
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,090
We're just talking what you got naturally.
Where do you think most people,

88
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:38,110
where would you rank yourself
naturally? I Dunno. Five.

89
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,480
Oh,
most people ranked themselves.

90
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,000
Most people that I've asked to rank
themselves a little bit higher than that.

91
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,720
They've ranked themselves 6.8 7.2 in that
they're giving themselves a little bit

92
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:52,090
above average, right? Yeah.
You're going five. Huh?

93
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,330
We'll keep in mind we just said the rock.
So I'm like all right.

94
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,693
Yeah that's true.

95
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,220
Well you know what we should have done
is we should've said one to a hundred so

96
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:05,490
you could say the rock is a
96 it's still be a 50 okay.

97
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,880
Yeah. All right, so you're giving
yourself five so, so that's, that's good.

98
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,150
And I'm sure you know we could break
that down about where you got the cause.

99
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,200
Cause some people,
this is important.

100
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,950
Some people can be a 10
or a 9.84 their intellect.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,740
But maybe they socially don't
have good skills about reading.

102
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:34,460
They weren't born with that little thing,
right? So they can't read people well.

103
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,840
So even though they're really smart,
they're not,

104
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,540
they're not making anything happen cause
they can't even communicate with people

105
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:41,990
well or they're just, they're not
healthy, right? They're bad athletes.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,890
Some people the opposite, wicked good
athlete, but they're just not that smart,

107
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,880
right? And everything of it. So you could,
you could be a nine athlete, but you're,

108
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:50,714
uh,

109
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,280
a very low whatever intellect and
that's going to bring you down.

110
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,210
Might even bring you down below average.
So,

111
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,500
so he got that chart and that's
it. Okay, so now we got that.

112
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,440
It's the holistic talent chart.
That's what we'll call it.

113
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,520
You got the holistic talent sharp
on one side. Now in your head,

114
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:14,840
I want you to picture on the other side.
The other side is another chart,

115
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,800
also one to 10, one being
the least, 10 being the most.

116
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,050
And this chart is to grade
success.

117
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
Now this is not easy to do because of
course you can ask yourself what is

118
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,270
success, right? What is really being
successful? And this is a good question.

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,901
And I remember,

120
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,390
I don't know if you remember this time
when people started asking me a lot about

121
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,910
how to raise your kids.
And I said,

122
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,400
well I don't want to talk about how to
raise kids cause I don't know if I'm a

123
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:45,110
success.
I don't know if my kids are successful.

124
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,380
I don't know if I should be giving that
advice because what if my kids aren't

125
00:07:48,381 --> 00:07:52,640
successful? And, and then when you, when
I started talking about that question,

126
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:55,160
it's like, okay, what if my kid,

127
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,570
if one of my kids goes and get a job
at an investment bank and he's making

128
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:04,430
$450,000 a year as a 26 year old,
is that successful?

129
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,110
It could be, but what if that kid is
miserable? What if that kid, you know, is,

130
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,890
is doing cocaine, right? That's
not successful. That's horrible.

131
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,290
So it's very hard to,
so that,

132
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,110
that makes you start thinking
about what is success.

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,440
But I think we can generally know and
understand what success broadly is when

134
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:29,510
you look at these individual
categories, right? So, okay,

135
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,030
good family, right? You've got a good
stable scenario going on with your family.

136
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:37,310
If you're old enough to have a family
for not old enough to have family,

137
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:41,030
at least you are prepared to have a
good family life. That type of thing.

138
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,890
That's one level of success.
Uh,

139
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:47,180
gratifying job meaning a
job that cause you can,

140
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,960
I know people that make a ton of money in
their job and they hate it. Yes. Right?

141
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,910
So is that successful?
[inaudible] maybe not the,

142
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,090
I know people that love their job,

143
00:08:57,091 --> 00:09:00,180
but they don't make any money and
they're struggling paycheck to paycheck.

144
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,020
Does that, is that success?
I don't know. Again,

145
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:06,590
these are all things we could
kind of weigh out. Yeah.

146
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,950
And then you've got health and wellness
because even though we talked about what

147
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,570
you're given naturally,

148
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,960
you got to remember that you think you
could work for something and you can,

149
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,020
you can be successful and be healthy
and be mobile and be not worried about

150
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:25,440
getting out of breath when you
walk up the stairs or whatever.

151
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,320
So the overall health and
wellness and so again,

152
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,900
you have to take all of these
different types of success,

153
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,910
all of them and wrap them up holistically.
And I don't know,

154
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,250
could we throw,
this might be the wrong,

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,130
you could possibly throw kind of a
strange, you could possibly fill the,

156
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:51,750
just the whole word happiness onto
this situation, right? This the,

157
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:56,030
the general term happiness where I,

158
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,040
but I think that's a scary thing to do
because happiness isn't necessarily a

159
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:06,171
good thing in terms of you meet someone
that's had a few beverages and even

160
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,360
though their life's a disaster,
man,

161
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,600
they're having a good time at the bar
to pretty happy. Is this our goal?

162
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,880
Not really.
That's why I think happiness is a,

163
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,970
I don't know that I would
throw it into this chart.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,820
I would call it success because it
has a little bit more strength to it.

165
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,650
Now you got your two,
you got your two,

166
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,740
your two charts.
Now on the left you have holistic talent.

167
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,280
Is that what I called it? Yes.
Holistic holistic talent. On the left.

168
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,760
On the right you have holistic success.
Success.

169
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,670
Now here's the question and I could ask
you where you are on the success side.

170
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,070
Yeah. Where are you? Oh,

171
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,340
seven Oh, okay, good, good.

172
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,900
So you were a five for talent and you're
a seven for success. That's pretty,

173
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,390
that's pretty legit.
Let me ask you,

174
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:15,391
this is every person that is at the top
of the talent chart holistically with

175
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:16,630
everything they've got,

176
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,810
is every one of those people that scores
at 9.8 at the top of the success chart,

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,900
the answer's no.
The answer's no.

178
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,170
Is every person that's on the bottom of
the talent holistic talent chart on the

179
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:37,300
bottom of the success
chart? No. The answer's no.

180
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,710
And what do we see? We
see that there's a, well,

181
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,270
when you put the space in between
these two, there's talent,

182
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,600
holistic talent,
and there's holistic success.

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,910
And there's a space in between
and that's what actually matters.

184
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:00,610
That's what actually matters.
What do you do? What do you do?

185
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,670
The fee and that to me,
and I hate to get,

186
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,030
I hate to throw this out there,
but for me,

187
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:12,700
the thing that's in between
the left and the right,

188
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:17,050
the thing that's in between towns success
is is can be summed up in one word,

189
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,090
discipline, discipline. Do you
have the discipline to do the work,

190
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,620
to make the hard decisions,

191
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:28,621
to put in the daily grind that's
going to get you from wherever you,

192
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,850
you started out with whatever level of
talent you had and move yourself up that

193
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,340
chart on the right hand side.

194
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,090
I think it's important to recognize
this and this conversation.

195
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,650
This particular conversation,

196
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,730
the first time I had it was with a younger
person who I could see in their eyes,

197
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,200
had the sense of like,
I don't know if I have the talent,

198
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,340
and it's like, well, you know, I don't
know if you have the talent either.

199
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,300
There's one way to find out.
You do the hard work,

200
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,330
you implement discipline on your life
and that will give you the opportunity to

201
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,690
see how far up that sucks.

202
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,340
One thing I can tell you is if you don't
have the discipline and you don't do

203
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:19,540
the work, you're not going to be above
your, your holistic talent level at all.

204
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,540
There's some people that make a run
for it, man. You know what I mean?

205
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:28,990
There's some people that have no
talent or very limited talent,

206
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,000
but they get after it and they end up way
off far on the success and or you know

207
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,670
what I think is good about this.
When you get some success,

208
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:40,750
you kind of compound that back into your
hard work and people start to get on an

209
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,370
upward spiral,

210
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,910
upward mobility towards the top of the
success chart cause they got a little

211
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,660
foothold. Once they got that foothold of
felt good, then they take another step,

212
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,730
they get a little bit further
and then they get a little,

213
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,230
a little bit more success,
boom,

214
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,810
and then they use that to propel
themselves up a little higher.

215
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,620
The problem is the reverse happens
as well. That's the problem.

216
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,300
People feel a little bit that
they got beat at something. Right.

217
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,490
The bad luck came your way because
you know what, on this in between,

218
00:14:06,491 --> 00:14:08,380
there's some luck in,
in between the discipline,

219
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,340
there's absolutely some luck as well.
There's some luck and you can get lucky.

220
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,980
You can meet the right person
at the right time. You can,

221
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:18,790
you can make a move at the right
time before anyone else did. You can,

222
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:23,200
you can get discovered by someone
or some thing, you know there's,

223
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:27,040
there's definitely some luck involved
for sure. You can't count on the luck.

224
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,470
The luck is not the reason.

225
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:32,950
Some people like to look at someone else
and say they're lucky they didn't see

226
00:14:32,951 --> 00:14:36,460
the, the, the thousands and thousands of
hours of hard work. That person put it.

227
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,200
They just saw that last little end
result where they got lucky allegedly.

228
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,700
Yeah. Yeah. The luck thing is,

229
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,050
is weird cause if you
can extrapolate it out,

230
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,800
like someone who can't want to play
football, we had to do these cool.

231
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:55,580
And they see something on the back or
the front, I don't know, whatever. Oh.

232
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,980
And it says chance favors.
One of them said chance favors
the prepared men. Right.

233
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,680
True. So it's like, same thing,
right? Chance and luck. Same thing.

234
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,390
So you'll like, the more prepared
you are, the more skills you have,

235
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:11,330
the more whatever they'll quote
unquote lucky you're going to get.

236
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,630
But really when you fit,
you switch the word luck for chance.

237
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:19,370
You just increase your chances of
success. So like, um, you know,

238
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,430
I dunno who got discovered,
you know, he, there,

239
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,970
they're going to be in a position
to be discovered, you know,

240
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,020
because whoever quote
unquote discovered them.

241
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm sure many people have been in that
situation too. You know, like, um,

242
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,250
you know, some guy goes on the news,
right, with his baskets than he makes,

243
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,930
you know, or whatever. And boom, he blows
up because those baskets are dope. Yeah.

244
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,460
But Brat planning people who've been
on the news with your thing, you know,

245
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,540
for years, decades, centuries main
maybe, essentially, but you know, no,

246
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,980
for Lego to be sexual CPR

247
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,770
people been going on in the news
with their thing for a long time.

248
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,000
Same thing with American idol. A lot
of people have been on American idol.

249
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,780
What I'm saying, how many people
really made it? Right. You know,

250
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:04,430
as far as getting discovered,
whatever. It's like, Oh yeah,

251
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:08,980
he got lucky or whatever. Yeah, man. But
you're not going to get lucky if you,

252
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,350
if you're kind of whack, you know, like
if you're, you're not prepared. If you're,

253
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,510
you don't have the skill,
you don't have the talent talent,

254
00:16:14,511 --> 00:16:19,250
you don't have the Xyz that it takes
then yeah. So it's Kinda like, yeah,

255
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,920
the luck is sprinkled in there
everywhere. Right. By the way, you know,

256
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,840
and maybe they didn't get
discovered on the news,

257
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,020
but maybe they went to somewhere else.
Then they got discovered, you know,

258
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:28,700
a year or two years
later, what are, you know,

259
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:31,690
so you just increase the probability
of being discovered when you have this

260
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:36,650
skill. So yeah, luck. Sure. It
is part of it for sure. But yeah,

261
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,910
it can propel you a little bit faster.

262
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:42,950
Or sometimes it's like one of those things
where you talk like a foothold, right?

263
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,690
There's a bunch of footholds everywhere
just because someone latched on to one

264
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:50,990
specific one that everyone at some point
to and say, he got lucky there. Well,

265
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:53,430
he's so good where she's so good
most of the time. All the time.

266
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,710
There's exceptions everywhere obviously,

267
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:56,630
but most of the time
that person is so good,

268
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,030
they would've got discovered somewhere
else anyway. It's just a matter of, oh,

269
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:04,040
this particular one made them get
discovered and propelled them all quick or

270
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:08,240
whatever. Well, this ties back into
something that I've said before,

271
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,430
and I'll say it again right now is make
your luck. You gotta make your luck.

272
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,530
And if you make it,
if you keep,

273
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,630
if you keep putting forth the maximal
effort that luck's gonna come,

274
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:25,460
you're gonna make your luck happen. You
know that. You know that actually when we,

275
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,390
when we came, when tasking at
bruiser came home from Iraq,

276
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,950
there was, there was, you
know, people were like, all,

277
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,870
you guys got super lucky on that
deployment because we got a lot of action,

278
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,370
right? And there was two like immediate
thoughts behind that was number one, like,

279
00:17:40,371 --> 00:17:44,480
hey, you know, first of
all we lost our bros.

280
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:49,481
Like they're nothing lucky about that was
the first immediate thought in my head

281
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,070
was like,

282
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,420
hey man, like cause cause the bottom
line is seals want to go into combat bad.

283
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,620
And that's just a broad statement.
And so when we came home,

284
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,650
had been in a lot of combat and killed a
lot of bad guys and people were kind of

285
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,530
saying,
hey you guys got lucky.

286
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,500
And again the first thought was, hey man
you did. If this is luck, I don't want it.

287
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,140
The second fault was just like
the same thing. Oh we got lucky.

288
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,430
We didn't like crush ourselves in the
workup and try and be the most, you know,

289
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,880
prepared we could be and
then get overseas and,

290
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:30,300
and form relationships with all the
conventional forces and do good work for

291
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:33,450
them and continue to, you know, just get,

292
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,630
go as hard as we could the whole time.
No, that didn't have anything to do with.

293
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,870
It was just luck and it kind of fell
into our lap. But you know, of course,

294
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,620
just nod your head and say, thanks man.
Appreciate it. Yeah, good times. Uh,

295
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,730
so luck is definitely a part of it.

296
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,060
A little part because where we
was I lucky to be in Ramadi,

297
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,110
it cause I could have deployed a year
later and a year later Ramadi was passed

298
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:57,520
by it. So is there a lock
there? There absolutely is. So,

299
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,740
I don't want to sound arrogant,
but luck is apart.

300
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:07,050
It's like foot locks. It's like a heel
hooks. They're a part of the game.

301
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,440
There are not a game changer right there.
They're a part of the game.

302
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,620
They're not a game changer. We,
we had a group come in, this is

303
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,100
back in the day,
a group came in,

304
00:19:17,101 --> 00:19:20,700
a guys that were known for
foot locking and he'll look,

305
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,110
and what they did, they thought we were
Jujitsu guys, normal dudes, you guys.

306
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,640
But we weren't because we were as dean.

307
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,200
So we were footlocker and he looking
all the time and these guys came in and

308
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:34,620
immediately they were going for,

309
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,750
these are the kind of guys that
would go and I don't know if you,

310
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:41,220
I don't know if you remember this time
period in Jujitsu, it was like immediate.

311
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,560
They're going for a full lock,
like just diving for it.

312
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,160
But they didn't know that we did for
alarms all the time and you weren't going

313
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,250
to just grab a full lock
on Dean lister or me.

314
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:55,140
Like it wasn't going to happen and it
kind of then of a sudden they didn't have

315
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,420
the rest of Jujitsu.
You'd have the rest of the game.

316
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,750
So then it was not good for them cause
they only had this one dimensional game.

317
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,270
And that's what taught me that
foot locks aren't important,

318
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:08,070
but they're not more important
than a choke or a guard pass.

319
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,710
They are definitely part of the game.
You can't leave out,

320
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,040
but they're not a game changer.
And you see that now,

321
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,670
now that you see everyone broadly
getting good at at the whole leg,

322
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,990
locking foot, locking, he'll hooking game.

323
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,800
Now you see it coming back around where
you have to have the rest of Jujitsu as

324
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:29,610
well. Like even even as much as
like a year ago, it was like, oh,

325
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:30,660
this guy got this crazy,

326
00:20:30,661 --> 00:20:32,670
he'll hook and the guy tapped and
you didn't know what was happening.

327
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,330
That very rapidly changes into,
okay, the guy went for a heel hook,

328
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:38,490
the other guy got out and now
we've got to where we back to.

329
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,260
We're back to the Jujitsu, so
same thing. Luck as a factor.

330
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:48,220
It's not the factor. Yeah. All
right. Now that's number one.

331
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,560
This is the number one thing
I wanted to talk about today.

332
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,620
If you're in that position where
you're looking at your talent,

333
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,520
and I guess this is,

334
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,500
I guess it's applicable to people that
are a little bit younger because people

335
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,800
that are a little bit older,
they probably figured this out already.

336
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,210
You probably looked at yourself in
the mirror and said, hey, look, I,

337
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,830
I might not have that much talent, but
I can, I can, I can get after, you know,

338
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:11,340
this is something that you say about
basketball too, and I don't, I don't,

339
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,640
I know you want a basketball player.

340
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,760
I played basketball growing
up and when I was growing up,

341
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:20,680
it was like the Hay Day of the Lakers
and the Celtics rivalry and all this.

342
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:25,510
Well, the hard work,
right? Just this like, Hey,

343
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,070
I'm going to work harder than anyone
else to make up for my lack of talent.

344
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,890
And they would say about Larry
Bird. You know, Larry Byrd is, yes.

345
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,690
They would say this is kind of garbage.
They'd say Larry Berg was an athletic,

346
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,970
which is total garbage. I mean, but
people would say that, and maybe it's,

347
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:45,610
cause he didn't have the,
the biggest vertical jump or whatever,

348
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,380
and they'd say he was like
slower than other players,

349
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:55,990
but he works so hard that he
was able to compensate for that.

350
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,570
Now again,
when I heard that when I was a kid,

351
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:01,390
I kind of believe that when you see Larry
Bird now, when I watch you know, games,

352
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:03,520
he was, he's a freaking
awesome athlete, you know,

353
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:06,400
and you're not playing in
the NBA and being a world
champion over and over again,

354
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:11,250
MVP without being of an awesome
athlete. Larry Bird, how old is he?

355
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:14,350
How talk he used to call,
he's like six [inaudible] tall guy,

356
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,790
this guy named Spud Webb who's like five.

357
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,360
Spud Webb for sure there is that. But
yeah, man, I dig it. And I remember this.

358
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:25,540
These spud Webb probably had to
work harder to make, what about,

359
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,390
there's a guy named,
I think his name was Muggsy Bogues.

360
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,990
You remember Muggsy Bogues you was now
he was even smaller than Spud Webb.

361
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,650
But he was so small that people,

362
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,410
it was a different little situation
that the players had to deal with.

363
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,630
He was so small and some of it so fast.
You know what's interesting,

364
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:44,710
I got some friends in hockey and as a
matter of fact, the goals, you know,

365
00:22:44,711 --> 00:22:48,870
the goals, the goal, the San
Diego goals. Yeah, yeah, sure.

366
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,520
So I went down and talked to the goals

367
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,470
and what's cool about what's cool
about that level of athletics,

368
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,520
which is the minor leagues,
the goals are a minor league team.

369
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:06,300
What's cool about that level of
athletics is those guys are hungry.

370
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,790
They're not prima donnas that are,
you know,

371
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
driving around in a chauffeured
car and all that stuff.

372
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,590
These guys are hungry
and they're playing hard.

373
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,930
And what's interesting is in hockey,
and this is within the last few years,

374
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,840
at one point a few years ago,

375
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,290
they were just getting the bigger and
bigger and bigger hockey players just

376
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:32,470
getting bigger guys. Cause you're just
there. Just monster guys that are six,

377
00:23:32,471 --> 00:23:36,790
six and six, five and six,
four and they way I, you know,

378
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,870
to 60 and that was the
way hockey was going.

379
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,650
But then what happened was they started
bringing out these guys that were

380
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,140
smaller and faster and that could go
maneuver quicker than the bigger guys.

381
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,960
And all of a sudden hockey's going
back in that direction to have smaller,

382
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:54,794
faster guys.

383
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,150
So it's interesting.

384
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,890
And the amount of talent
that that employees,

385
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,520
hey, figure it out. You
can make something happen.

386
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:12,521
Muggsy Bogues Spud Webb make
it happen regardless of height.

387
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,950
But to my point, Larry
Bird, when I was a kid,

388
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:21,340
I would hear about Larry Bird not being
a good athlete and all you had to do was

389
00:24:21,921 --> 00:24:26,300
work hard, which, which left an impression
on me as a kid. Hey look, very bird's,

390
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:28,610
not that he's not that great athlete,
but he's got to work hard.

391
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,540
So we asked what I'm going to
do. Work hard, work harder.

392
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,390
They say that about Dan Gable to
yeah, the wrestler. Yeah. Hey,

393
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:41,900
maybe not the fastest, but his thing
was I'll, I'll outwork them all.

394
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:47,240
You ever heard stories about him? Dan
Gable? Yeah. He would just run from every,

395
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,410
every place he would go.

396
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:52,280
He would run st near that story
from class to class in college,

397
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:54,290
from class to the cafeteria,
you'd run everywhere.

398
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,620
So hard work now. Okay, so that wraps
up, we got talent on the one side,

399
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,320
we've got success on the
other side and that's cool.

400
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,000
And we know that we can progress up that
chart for the young people out there

401
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,820
and even the old people out
there, if you, if you're,

402
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,530
if you're on the lower end of that
chart of, of the talent chart, boom,

403
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,880
work hard, applied discipline, make
good decisions, you can end up further.

404
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,990
You can go to the top of that
success chart. Boom. Now,

405
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:27,140
now we're going to get weight.

406
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,430
I guess we're going to get away from
the holistic success a little bit here.

407
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,860
Maybe not. Maybe, maybe not.

408
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,440
This is a conversation that I've also
had and it had it primarily with two,

409
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,270
two people that I know pretty well.

410
00:25:40,271 --> 00:25:42,380
One of them very well and
one of them decently well

411
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,390
and this is the conversation,
these two individuals,

412
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,460
high talent high in the talent chart.
So what does that mean?

413
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,740
They're smart.
You know,

414
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:59,741
they've got that personal interoperability
with other human beings on top of

415
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:03,230
that. Super driven on top of that.
They've got the whole work thing too.

416
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:06,680
They got the discipline thing
down to they've got all that.

417
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,410
They're maxed out in the
game that they're playing.

418
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,390
So what do I mean by that?

419
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,280
In soccer, how many goals can you
score? Let's say you're the best team,

420
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,340
either best player on your team and
you're going to play a season worth of

421
00:26:25,341 --> 00:26:28,730
soccer. How many goals can you score and
the whole season. Then the whole season,

422
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,110
I don't know how many games,
I dunno, let's call it,
let's say you play 15 games,

423
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,610
so you're going to,
I don't know,

424
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,700
45 maybe 60 goals.
Okay,

425
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,450
that's completely unrealistic.
Yeah.

426
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,240
We'll take it 15 so you say
three goals for 45 yeah,

427
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:51,600
we'll go. This guy gets a hat
trick, which is a rarity in soccer.

428
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,170
We'll say he gets it for every game for
15 games season and that's where he ends

429
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:59,700
up. He ends up at 45 calls.
I'll totally watch kids soccer,

430
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,940
so my numbers might be off a little bit.
Okay.

431
00:27:02,941 --> 00:27:07,170
Now what if you were a basketball player
and how many basket, how many games,

432
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,070
how many goals can you make in
basketball in a game? You know,

433
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,710
realistically on the High
End, 21 points. Yeah.

434
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:20,040
Then you multiply that times a season
and you obviously can score way more in

435
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:24,750
basketball than you can in soccer.
Clearly this is where,

436
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,261
again,

437
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:30,261
I've had this conversation primarily
around the financial aspects of work for

438
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:34,500
people.
If you get in,

439
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,140
you have to look at the
game that you're playing.

440
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,180
Cause sometimes the game that you're
playing a soccer and it doesn't matter how

441
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,570
much talent you haven't, doesn't
matter how much hard work you, you,

442
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,630
you put into it,

443
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:50,550
you can only score 45 goals and that's it.

444
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,310
And meanwhile,

445
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,180
someone that maybe doesn't even have the
talent and doesn't have the work ethic

446
00:27:57,181 --> 00:28:00,420
that you had, but they're playing
a different game and their scorn,

447
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,740
200300400 goals,
they're making two,

448
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:07,290
three times as much money as you.
Why?

449
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:10,170
Because the game that they are playing.

450
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,710
So you have to look at
that every game just about,

451
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:18,683
well I'll say it.

452
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,750
Every game that you can play has a cap
on it of what you can actually make until

453
00:28:24,091 --> 00:28:27,870
you get to the top and you look at it and
you change your angle, you change your,

454
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,740
you change your angle of the game. You
could say, I'm gonna create a new game.

455
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,720
You know, you could get really good
at soccer and say, you know what?

456
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:37,500
I've maxed this game out and to create a
new game where it's a smaller field and

457
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:41,250
a bigger goal, you know, you could do that
and people do that in industry, right?

458
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:42,590
People do that in industry.
They,

459
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,780
they get to the top of their game and
they start a new game, a different game.

460
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:48,210
They changed the rules a little
bit where they can score more.

461
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,130
I'm totally supportive of that.

462
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:56,030
The problem is I just want to make sure
that people recognize that sometimes

463
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,060
you've put in awesome, you've got,
you're a very talented person,

464
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:04,650
you've put in a lot of work and
you got to the t, you got to the,

465
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,220
you kept out your game. You're going to
get as many goals as you're going to get.

466
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:11,640
That's it. Yeah. And so you can't
get frustrated. I'll tell you what.

467
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,490
I was in the navy, I was in
the navy. You get everyone.

468
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,630
I was an owl.

469
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,400
I retired as an old four e over 20,
which means,

470
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,050
which means I was a prior enlisted guy.

471
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,650
You can go look at what my salary was
and then you can have my little specialty

472
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,410
pays in for jump dive demo,
special duty assignment pay.

473
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:35,940
You can add those little things in there.
You can add my beat, uh, officer housing,

474
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,390
basic allowance for housing in there.
You can figure out, I mean it's,

475
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,460
you're going to make this much money.
That's it. That's the cap. Yeah.

476
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:45,220
That's what you're going to make now.

477
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Now we start to talk about can you
play multiple games at the same time?

478
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,850
And the answer to that is yes, you
can. You can play multiple games.

479
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,790
Now I kind of,

480
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,140
I kind of said this on a
different podcast. Somebody
had talked about, you know,

481
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:08,590
having a side hustle while you're in
the military. And I was like, well no,

482
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:13,591
you can't really do that because you know
you got to focus 100% of your job and

483
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:15,490
then,

484
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:20,260
but the reality is I had a side hustle
the whole time I was in because I guess

485
00:30:20,261 --> 00:30:24,430
what I was doing, how is buying
houses? I was saving my money.

486
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:28,690
I was driving a 1997 dodge grand caravan
and I was buying a house here and I was

487
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:33,691
buying a house there and
that's when you have a,

488
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,910
when you have a alternate
job or an alternate game
that you're going to play in

489
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:40,900
the military,
it's okay.

490
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:45,220
It just has to be on a complete not to
interfere basis so it doesn't interfere.

491
00:30:45,221 --> 00:30:46,054
Occasionally if you're a pro,

492
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,030
if you've got a few properties and
one of them has a broken water heater,

493
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:51,930
you can mitigate that by making sure
you've got a good property manager and

494
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,280
making sure you know the right handyman.

495
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,390
I can go over and square that stuff
away and get that problem solved.

496
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,010
I had some kind of catastrophic
situations. I had the big flood

497
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,380
or the big broken no slab like well if
cracked pipe in the slab, I had a crap.

498
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,180
One of my rentals has flooded twice.

499
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,140
Once from the ceiling
wants from the ground.

500
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,280
How does it flood from the theme from
seeing the crack pipe in the upstairs

501
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:20,950
bathroom, crack pipe somewhere,
boom, drip, drip, drip.

502
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:22,510
Next thing you know
you've got water damage.

503
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,910
The other one pipes running through the
slab because something goes wrong or

504
00:31:27,911 --> 00:31:30,010
whatever,
and that thing starts to leak.

505
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,670
Tenants don't say anything
for a long period of time,

506
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:38,130
even though hearing their hands squish,
squish, squish under the, under the, the,

507
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:42,430
the flooring, they don't say anything.
Guess what? Everything's ruined.

508
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,410
You got to come in. They, you know.

509
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:47,290
So what do you do with those
catastrophic situations? Well,

510
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,320
if you've got the right management
team in place and gets handled,

511
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,010
it gets handled. Make the phone
calls people, get it taken care of.

512
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:58,540
You don't have to worry about it.
So you can't do that.

513
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:03,010
It's gotta be on a not to interfere basis
with your primary job if you're in the

514
00:32:03,011 --> 00:32:06,580
military. And really it's the same
thing. If you have a primary, you know,

515
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:07,570
you got your primary job,

516
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:09,400
you're working for someone
and you're doing nine to five.

517
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,260
You don't want to interfere.
You want,

518
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,320
you want your side alternative Gig to
be on a not to interfere basis with your

519
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:24,430
primary gig.
Now the other thing that you can do,

520
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,270
and this is where you start to look
at, okay, cause you, you, you, you,

521
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,330
you're playing games,

522
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:32,050
you're playing these different
games because you want to
move yourself up on the

523
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,240
success level.
Sometimes you have,

524
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,820
and I see people do this and
some people do this really well.

525
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,950
They have one game that
they're playing to make.

526
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:45,140
They have another game that they're
playing to be, you know, to,

527
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,080
to win in their health, right?
They're doing marathons there,

528
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,720
there Jackin steal there,
they're doing Jujitsu.

529
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,850
They've got another game that they're
playing to get some sort of gratification

530
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,370
out of life, some kind of positive
gratification out of life,

531
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,320
whether they're working as a volunteer,

532
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:04,580
whether they're donating time to the
supe kid, whatever you're, they're doing,

533
00:33:04,581 --> 00:33:08,750
they're doing something that's giving
them some gratification that they're

534
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:13,370
moving the ball forward for humanity.
And

535
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,620
that's, that's, that's a
good thing in my opinion.

536
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,430
So sometimes I think someone's there,
they're,

537
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,220
they're losing their soul because
I work at a job to make money.

538
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:28,150
They don't like it. They're
not healthy. And then,

539
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,830
and they feel like they're just
giving all their time to the man.

540
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,250
What should that person
do in that situation?

541
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,240
Find some other games that you
can play to find some other games.

542
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,960
Find a game to take care of your health.
Find a game to take care of your family.

543
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,070
I mean, you know, for, for
family, right? How do you,

544
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,300
what game can you play to take?

545
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,800
Make sure you get the
family unity that you want.

546
00:33:51,801 --> 00:33:54,770
There's all kinds of things that you
can do, right? Whether it's camping,

547
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:58,070
whether it's vacations, whether it's
going on, on rock climbing trips,

548
00:33:58,071 --> 00:33:59,560
whether it's everyone going to do Jujitsu,

549
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,740
whether it's you're doing a 15
minute PT in the morning, whatever.

550
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,930
But there's things,
there's some games that you can play to,

551
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,610
to get that side of things.

552
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,320
So there's all kinds of these various,

553
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,850
we'll call them games that get played.
But what I find,

554
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:18,650
this is the whole point
of this conversation.

555
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,160
What I find is people aren't aware
that they're in a specific game,

556
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,160
and that game has limitations
in that game, has rules.

557
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,880
And if you don't recognize that you're
going to play that game and you're gonna

558
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:35,750
keep playing that game soccer game, and
you think you're going to get more goals,

559
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,750
they're not coming
because you can't do it.

560
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,550
That game is limited in its own right.

561
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,540
So what you have to do is you have to
either change the game where you got to

562
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,600
find a new game to get into.
If you're young,

563
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:51,470
look at what game you're gonna
play and figure out what you know,

564
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,620
how you're going to win in multiple
games so that you can move yourself up on

565
00:34:56,631 --> 00:35:01,280
the success
holistic success chart.

566
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,890
Sure. So there you go. That's
the first thing I wanted to, um,

567
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,220
to talk about today.
Number one,

568
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,160
the second thing I wanted to talk about

569
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:20,420
is Connor versus could
beep. All right. Okay.

570
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:25,040
So Connor versus could be, and
once again, this I realized,

571
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:29,600
I think the only other time
we've talked about a fight in,

572
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,890
in, in, on this podcast was another
Conor fight. I think it would make,

573
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:36,990
it might've been Connor versus Nate.

574
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,020
So why are we talking about
this fight? Well, there's,

575
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:47,400
there's two major reasons. Well, there's
three major reasons I guess now. One is,

576
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,490
was it the biggest fight
of all time in UFC?

577
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:56,070
It possibly was. I don't know. What do
you think? Yeah, I mean, I don't know.

578
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:59,730
It's hard to compare now because
yeah, cause it's, I would say no,

579
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,550
I would say yeah, because the fan base
is probably bigger than it's ever been.

580
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,830
Just overall. What about the hype
behind this fight? No, I felt like,

581
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,410
well then again, I don't
know. That can be my bubble.

582
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,370
I didn't hear as much about it. I heard
a lot about it for sure. I didn't,

583
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:18,180
but I didn't wait. Which one did
you hear more about? Jon Jones?

584
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,370
Some of the John Jones
fights. I remember. Yeah.

585
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,270
And then I'm also like some of the Brock
Lesnar fights. I remember thinking like,

586
00:36:24,271 --> 00:36:28,950
Dang, newsers you, here's what I think.
I don't know. No holds it. Sorry.

587
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:31,980
Josie Aldo, Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor.
He, that was a huge, that might,

588
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,270
that might've been, that might've been
bigger. Yeah. And they did more toward,

589
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:37,500
they did a big press thing.

590
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,970
Here's though I think that people had
a better handle on what could happen in

591
00:36:44,251 --> 00:36:45,240
the Jose Aldo fight.

592
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,190
I think people didn't know what
was going to happen in this fight.

593
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,740
Yeah. What's funny is for me, I was wrong
by the way, but it was the opposite.

594
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,320
I thought, oh, Josie, I was just
gonna beat this guy up. Oh really?

595
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,320
And then actually this one I thought
could be, was going to win too. Yeah.

596
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,450
So that's, let's get to that then.
All right. Um, I sent out a tweet,

597
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,630
which I normally don't, and so I
sent out a her, here's the tweet,

598
00:37:12,631 --> 00:37:15,720
here's the tweet that I actually sent out.
It was to the notorious MMA,

599
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,800
which is Connor. I said, stay
outside the first three rounds.

600
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,760
Don't overcommit strikes mostly jabs.

601
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,860
Get booed by the crowd. Doesn't
matter. Frustrate, frustrate.

602
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,020
Could be forced bad shots.

603
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,370
Tire them out in the fourth start
stepping up the striking in the fifth.

604
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,720
Let it go and finish him. Good
luck. John Cavanaugh at John Kevin.

605
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:43,950
I tagged his coach because
his coach, well, okay,

606
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:46,950
now people are going, okay, well why
were you rooting for Conor McGregor?

607
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,390
And some people went a little crazy.
Like why are you when he's a bad sets,

608
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:55,320
a bad example for the sport and all men.
So

609
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,120
actually the reason is because I've
communicated with coach Cavenaugh a decent

610
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:06,110
amount on Twitter and little dms
and all that and just, you know, he,

611
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,340
he just has been kind of like a cool guy.

612
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,950
And here he was going into coach
his fighter in the biggest fight of,

613
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:17,670
of Connor's life.
And you know,

614
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,680
just because we've had
that little commerce,

615
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,580
we've had conversations on Twitter a
bunch and I just threw that out there like

616
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,870
two hours before.
I mean we,

617
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,080
I was watching the first fights
when I threw that out there.

618
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,570
I didn't know what the
really funny thing is.

619
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:35,160
John Calvin notes texted back or he,
he tweeted back copy.

620
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,070
So he actually read it and responded,
which is pretty crazy.

621
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,370
Um, so, so anyways,

622
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:47,371
because I have had a little
interaction with coach John Cavenaugh,

623
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,850
I felt like, you know, hey,

624
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:55,810
I'll throw this out there
also. You know, Hans,

625
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:00,850
Hans is like boys with Connor,
right? And Hans is my boy. So I was,

626
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:02,920
you know that that association,
There's association,

627
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:03,940
you know what I'm going to be like,
Hey,

628
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:08,941
Hans is my boy and he has been for a
long time and he's Bros with Connor.

629
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,350
And so I just, you know, like
again, so, so people are,

630
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:18,430
why did you, why are you voting for this
guy win? So there's that whole thing.

631
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,410
Now, the other odd thing about this
is you have a striker versus grappler.

632
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,830
Who Do I root for?
And striker versus grappler crap.

633
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:30,940
I always root for the grappler and I
know that factually and statistically the

634
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:38,950
grappler has the advantage
because grappling versus striking,

635
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,260
the grappler wins most of the time.

636
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,590
How can you go the distance
with this argument?

637
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,910
Sure you can took it all the people
that all the Times that a striker is

638
00:39:48,911 --> 00:39:52,120
actually a good grappler and then
they don't use their grappling,

639
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,610
but they use their grappling only
to defend from being taken down.

640
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:56,920
Chuck Liddell the,
and there's a bunch of us,

641
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,610
there's countless guys that you can now
name that knocked people out and we're

642
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,630
known for their standup.
But what they really were,

643
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:05,440
their base was that they were a good
restaurant, couldn't be taken down. So,

644
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,860
but generally striker
versus grappler the striker,

645
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:15,120
and this is what I talk about from a
self defense perspective, right? If, uh,

646
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:19,320
if you're a good striker,
then that means you can run away and,

647
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:22,240
and if you're a good grappler,
once you get ahold of someone,

648
00:40:22,241 --> 00:40:23,620
you can defeat someone
that has good striking.

649
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,070
Here's the thing that people
don't understand. In order
for you to punch someone,

650
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,920
you have to get close enough for them.
That where they can take you down.

651
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,810
You have to get into their takedown ranch,
the red.

652
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:34,450
So you have to get in the red zone.
So once you're in the red zone,

653
00:40:34,451 --> 00:40:35,284
you can get taken down.

654
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,330
So how do you defeat that as a,

655
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,060
as a striker,
how do you defeat a really good grappler?

656
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:51,430
Um, the way you do it is by
we'll do. And what I just said,

657
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,970
you stay on the outside. You, you touched
person up. You don't overcommit to sir.

658
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Cause the, the harder you notice. How
many rounds have you done if MMA sparring?

659
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,320
Countless. Okay. Me Too.

660
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,040
So when I would be
going against extractor,

661
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,320
the harder they throw at you, the easier
it is to take them down all day long.

662
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,280
And when I'm going against a wrestler
that I don't want to get taken down

663
00:41:15,281 --> 00:41:17,950
against. Like I used to do this to
dean and it just frustrate them,

664
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,720
not commit to any punches,

665
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:23,770
not throw any kicks it all sit there and
jab and run away for basically two or

666
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,950
three rounds. And even dean who's
a far superior wrestler to me,

667
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,540
he would have a very, very
hard time taking me down. Yeah.

668
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,100
So this is a strategy.

669
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,820
The reason I know it's a legit strategies
because people have used it against

670
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,190
dean.
When Dean was fighting MMA,

671
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,220
people used that particular

672
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:47,570
strategy against him and it worked.

673
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,360
And so I know the strategy works guys,

674
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:55,361
that Dean was infinitely better on on
the ground and yet he couldn't take them

675
00:41:56,091 --> 00:41:58,550
down and he was infinitely better at
wrestling. Why couldn't he take them down?

676
00:41:58,551 --> 00:42:01,530
Because they weren't playing that game.
They weren't playing,

677
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,270
they weren't even playing the MMA and
they were playing the almond a jab you and

678
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,104
stay away.

679
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,040
Now a couple of things also,

680
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,870
Connors attitude, Connors, what
are you want to call it? His, his,

681
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,530
the way he behaves right?
He's unsportsmanlike.

682
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:22,760
And he's a trash talker and all
that. I get it. Number one, he's,

683
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:27,820
he's trying to sell fights like
w w is he a very confident,

684
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,600
perhaps in overconfident
guide? Actually. Maybe,

685
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,170
but if you ever see his work ethic,
it's freaking solid.

686
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,400
He's always respectful after a
loss. So when he loses, he's,

687
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,240
he is respectful and he says, Hey, good
job. You got beat. You know, he doesn't,

688
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:48,800
he's not, he's not a poor loser. Um,

689
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,760
and he's a hard worker.

690
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,860
And do I wish that he would behave
a little bit differently? I,

691
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,980
I don't. Yeah. I mean
it's, it's, it's him. Yeah.

692
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:02,930
As another thing is that's, that's him.

693
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,340
You know what I mean?
That's him.

694
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:09,430
And you can't expect guys that are
going to do what he's going to do for a

695
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:14,480
living to behave the way
that you want them to behave.

696
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:16,730
It's the same thing with guys
that are in the military, right?

697
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:20,540
You can expect a guy that's going to
go put his life on the line to be as,

698
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,410
as Kipling says, a plaster
St, right. It doesn't happen.

699
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,220
You've got a guy that you want to go
kill people and you want him to put his

700
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:29,300
life at risk.
Guess what?

701
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:34,490
He's going to get a little crazy sometimes
and as a leader, as a even as society,

702
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:36,200
we have to look at those
guys and go, okay, look,

703
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,810
we'll give you a little bit of room.
We want you to stay in the box here.

704
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,270
We don't want you to get out of control,
and that happens all the time.

705
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:44,870
Military guys get in trouble all the time.
They get out, they get outside the box,

706
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,760
but you've got to give him a
little bit of room. If you,

707
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,930
if you didn't want that type of person,
you would have no one in a while.

708
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:54,530
You would have a very few people in the
military because you take someone that's

709
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,210
attitude is, you know, hey, I'm
a, I'm a saint. Well guess what?

710
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:01,160
A saint doesn't want to go
hunt people down and kill him.

711
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,880
A saint doesn't want to
get in the mud and blood,

712
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,830
blood and guts and be in that situation.
It's very similar with fighters. Now,

713
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:14,831
are there fighters that do
behave in an idealistic way?

714
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,490
Sure, absolutely. There are. Is that
preferred? Sure. That's great to see.

715
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,570
I would prefer it. I don't know, but
it's great to see. I mean probably in my,

716
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,800
I want to, I don't know who my
favorite fighter of all time is,

717
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,160
but fader is definitely at the,
you know,

718
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:37,161
he's in the top three of
my favorite writers and one
of my favorite things about

719
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:42,180
for faders, faders showed no emotions
ever at any time. Winter loose,

720
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,440
the same reaction. He mostly one, but
he would just raise his hand like he,

721
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:49,590
when he barely even raised his hand, be
like a half her, it'd be like half like,

722
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:51,660
Hey,
I just just destroyed this person in one,

723
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,820
$2 million here in Japan and I'm taking
the pride of Russia home with me.

724
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,120
No big deal. I'm going to
go lift a kettle bell. Uh,

725
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,690
Sakharova soccer.
Rob Was the same way,

726
00:45:03,691 --> 00:45:07,110
very v and the thing that was
funny about Sakharova, again,

727
00:45:07,111 --> 00:45:11,850
he's one of my favorite
fighters is Sakuraba. The only
thing that was, you could,

728
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,650
you could hold against soccer sometimes.
He would like clown people almost. Yeah.

729
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,080
And he was almost had some of
that professional wrestling
stuff going on. Yeah.

730
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:24,750
So anyways, uh, Conor is Conor,

731
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:29,100
Conor will mature and he'll
get older and that's fine.

732
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,840
He backs it up, he puts it on the line,
bro. He puts on, he doesn't avoid fights.

733
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:35,040
I can say that,
you know,

734
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,770
he takes the hardest fights
he can possibly find when he,

735
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:43,020
when he lost to Nate Diaz to say, I
want to fight him again next. Yeah.

736
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,490
You know, that's legit. So anyways,

737
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,900
there was a couple of people that
were like straight up, just hostile.

738
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,760
Why are you supporting Carter? He's a
bad sport. He just represents like, okay,

739
00:45:56,761 --> 00:46:00,540
I get it. So there's why
John Kavanagh, great coach,

740
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,830
my buddy haunts friends
with them. Um, yeah.

741
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,040
Now for the actual game plan,

742
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,600
the actual game plan that I talked
about, number one, stay outside.

743
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:17,670
Stay outside. You stay outside the
range of that person you get just,

744
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:20,430
we can barely touch them with a jab
and you get ready to sprawl. Now,

745
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:24,150
Connor actually did a good job.
He sprawled a few times. He,

746
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,700
he defended the takedown
on several occasions.

747
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:31,110
He did a good job on the bottom of,
you know,

748
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:33,210
Khabib does this thing that dean does too,

749
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:37,320
which is he ties up your legs with
his legs, kind of like captures them.

750
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:39,660
And when you can't pull your legs
out when you're up against the cage,

751
00:46:39,661 --> 00:46:43,680
you cannot get up. Yeah. Connor, God,
his legs out over and over and over.

752
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,880
That was impressive. That was impressive.
So that's number one. You stay outside,

753
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,740
it's really hard to take,
you know,

754
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:51,750
even even against someone
that's a great wrestler,

755
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,640
me and I'm not a great wrestler. I
can, I can back up and stay away. It's,

756
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,490
I'm really hard to take down and
so isn't it? So is anybody, if you,

757
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:02,430
if your sole goal is
to not get taken down,

758
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:07,820
it's actually not that hard to knock
it taken down now it changes when you,

759
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,670
when you start committing to your punches,
it changed.

760
00:47:11,671 --> 00:47:13,440
When you start trying to
knock someone out, it changes.

761
00:47:13,441 --> 00:47:16,080
When you start getting into a
wrestling match with people,

762
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,810
then it's easy to get taken
down. You know, Taylor, right?

763
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,870
Olive oil to take down on Taylor and
as soon as we start mixing it up,

764
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,530
guess what you're getting? Yeah, getting
taken down cause I play his game.

765
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,650
Can't play his game. Okay, next part.

766
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:32,170
Don't over what happens when you throw
strikes, your weight goes forward.

767
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,890
When your weight is forward
you you can get taken down.

768
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,030
That's all there is to it.

769
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,050
So you don't want to throw big heavy
punches early because that's when the take

770
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:44,110
down is going to come.
Mostly Jabs again,

771
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,480
that's the Lightest
Punch your furthest away.

772
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,720
I wouldn't even throw kicks. Maybe a
couple of kicks but I wouldn't throw him.

773
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:55,780
He's fast cars fast so he might be
able to get away with it but I probably

774
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:57,160
wouldn't even throw any
kicks in the first round.

775
00:47:57,161 --> 00:48:00,640
Maybe start throwing some kicks in
the second round but kicks again.

776
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,410
Kicks take time and a well timed shot.
We'll take you down on a,

777
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:10,120
on a kick. Can you chop at the legs? Yeah,

778
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:10,990
you can shop with the legs.

779
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:15,580
That can have a big negative impact on
the person you're fighting. Getting booed.

780
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,260
Right.
Why did I say get booed?

781
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:20,650
The reason I said get booed is because
if you're doing this strategy right,

782
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:23,230
people are mad at you because they
think you're avoiding the fight.

783
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:26,140
They think that you're not being
aggressive and they're going to get mad.

784
00:48:26,141 --> 00:48:29,290
The crowd is going to hate you, and that's
just what you got to deal with, right?

785
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,870
When your crowd is frustrated and annoyed
at you, guess what? So is your opponent.

786
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:40,030
So now your opponent starts getting
frustrated and taking bad shots,

787
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,650
and when that, and when that opponent is
taking shots that are outside the zone,

788
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,670
you basically have to be able to put your
hands on someone for the most part in

789
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:51,730
order to get a good shot and take them
down. When you're outside that zone,

790
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:54,120
it's you just, there's a, there's a war.

791
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:59,080
There's a fraction of a second difference
that it takes you to get to the shit,

792
00:48:59,081 --> 00:49:03,010
to the grip on the person that you
can. You can stop it. You can stop it.

793
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,470
You can't,
you can't shoot from too far away.

794
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,710
And when you get someone frustrated and
you're touching them up with jabs and

795
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:11,200
they're getting mad and they're hearing
the boos, the crowd, they get frustrated.

796
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,490
They start shooting from far away. When
they start shooting from far away, yes,

797
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,290
sprawl on them. You put your hands on the
back of their head, you stand back up,

798
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:19,600
you walk away and you make them do
it again. You make them do it again.

799
00:49:19,601 --> 00:49:24,040
You make them do it again. I said, tire
mountain. A lot of people were saying, oh,

800
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,330
Connor's cardio's no good, and that's
not a good plan. You're an idiot.

801
00:49:28,331 --> 00:49:32,500
That type of thing. The reason I
said that is because first of all,

802
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,470
wrestling is for the most part,

803
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:39,340
wrestling is more tiring than striking.

804
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,640
That being said,
if someone's,

805
00:49:42,641 --> 00:49:45,970
or if someone's a good wrestler
and not a good striker,

806
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:50,620
they're going to get more tired striking
than they are wrestling. So you take,

807
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,040
you take Khabib out of his
game, his game, his wrestling.

808
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:57,490
He's not getting tired wrestling and
he's getting a little bit tired. However,

809
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,670
when he shot four times and around
and you've defended all of them,

810
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:06,150
it is absolutely easier to defend take
downs than it is to to to do take downs.

811
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,620
It's a lot easier. I mean, we do
these drills all the time. In fact,

812
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:14,230
the way that we run the drills,
when you first,

813
00:50:14,231 --> 00:50:15,640
when you're the first
monkey in the middle,

814
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,520
you're the one that's doing the take
downs and when you're more tired,

815
00:50:18,521 --> 00:50:20,500
all you have to do is
defend the takedowns. Why?

816
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:23,110
Because it's easier to defend take downs.
You don't have to work as hard.

817
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:24,580
All you have to do is
counter what they're doing.

818
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:30,200
So you take him and you
tie them down and Connor,

819
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:32,900
Connor's not going to get
tired while he's striking, oh,

820
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:35,090
he's going to get less tired.
While he's striking again,

821
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:40,190
could could con or use an improve in his
cardio. Sure, sure. I've seen him fade.

822
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:44,300
We've all seen him fade. That's a bad
thing. He needs to step that game up.

823
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,380
I'd love to look at his training and
see where we could fill in those holes.

824
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,360
But the bottom line is he's going to get
more tired of which he did when he's in

825
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:56,570
a wrestling grappling scenario than he
does when he's standing up throwing jabs.

826
00:50:56,571 --> 00:51:00,200
He said he looks like he's in walking
through the park when he's standing up.

827
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,750
So you do that, you, you,
you, that's what you do.

828
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,590
You stand up your tire amount and you
don't overcommit and let them run out.

829
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:12,530
You're now some people. So we use as a
congress to just trying to knock them out.

830
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,440
There's a problem with that idea of
is that great? It was a great one.

831
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:18,020
It happens to Aldo. Sure.
You can't count on knockouts,

832
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,810
you can't count on them when
you're throwing knockout punches,

833
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,010
guess what happens?
You're over committing.

834
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,630
When he overcommitting it's
easy to get taken down.

835
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,150
So there you go.
Now what actually happened in the fight,

836
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,410
Conor pressed forward almost
the whole time, which,

837
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,050
which when you press forward,

838
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:41,110
it's easy for a grappler to time your
moot forward movement and shoot on you and

839
00:51:41,421 --> 00:51:45,860
take you down. And, and that's what
happened. Like I said, he escaped.

840
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,970
He escaped from the Mount position a
few times. That was impressive. He got,

841
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,500
it's usually the Camaro. Yes,
the attempt could be, could be,

842
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:58,490
but had a camera on him. Yes. Legit come
here. And I was like, oh this is over.

843
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:03,680
Nope. Nope. Conor got out. I think Conor
got out through brute, just like strength.

844
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,930
So he got out of that and he
recovered recovered guard a few times.

845
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,850
He freed his legs from those weird,
um,

846
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,410
half guard sort of leg
control things that dean does.

847
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,750
He freed his legs from
those a bunch of times.

848
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:22,810
He survived fairly well on the bottom
in the early rounds and that's all he

849
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:27,650
needed to do. If he would've done
this game plan of staying away,

850
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:30,350
if he got taken down with one minute left,
cause he starts doing it,

851
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,560
then you survived for a minute. It's okay.
It's okay. You survived for a minute.

852
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:37,700
That rounds over and then you
get to try it again. Uh, again,

853
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,780
the reason that I know this game plan
works is because it's been used against my

854
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:46,600
fighter dean.
And you know who did Amare sue levy.

855
00:52:46,601 --> 00:52:48,440
He's a, he's a dean. Talked about him.

856
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:53,390
He's a Russian guy that ended up
like mafia dude or something hit man.

857
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,750
But that's what he did.
Just stay away.

858
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,990
The guy was a better striker and don't
overcommit and that's what happens.

859
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:05,420
And you know what's also weird is people
even do this in Jujitsu matches. Yeah.

860
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:08,630
They do this in ADCC where,
hey,

861
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:13,631
if I'm a great wrestler and you're better
at Jujitsu than me and I don't want to

862
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:16,790
go to the ground with you, I just play
the patty cake for a while and then I,

863
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:19,640
what I do is when there's one minute left,
I do one take down,

864
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:23,280
I get two points and then I cover up
and hold and I win the match. Yeah.

865
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,980
So people do this in,
they do this.

866
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,650
Another thing that did do
that they do in Jujitsu,

867
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,560
and this is something that you have
to work on as a Jujitsu practitioner.

868
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,050
Let's say you and I are training
and you get the take down on me,

869
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:42,180
what do I do? Well, I
engage with my guard.

870
00:53:42,181 --> 00:53:44,430
I started looking for, you
know, grabbing your arm.

871
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:48,810
I start looking for neck control. I
immediately start doing Jujitsu with you.

872
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:53,130
What if I want to really it I have,
there's another,

873
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:57,030
there's a whole nother game I can play
with you, which is you take me down.

874
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,590
I immediately try and get back up. Yeah.
That's a, that's a totally different game.

875
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:07,110
This fouls up.
Like I used to not do this with dean.

876
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,360
I used to not do this with,

877
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:13,230
I do with Andy now because I have to
because people are going to do that.

878
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,550
People are going to do that.

879
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,500
When you're in a competition and
someone takes you down or you get, yeah,

880
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,810
you take someone down.
If they're not comfortable,

881
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,690
if they think you might be a little
bit better than normal on the ground,

882
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,900
they're just going to try and get back
to her feet and that is a different game

883
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,990
than just engaging in Jujitsu.
Yeah.

884
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,600
Or if they don't like their buttons, you
know, guys, they don't like the bottom of,

885
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:37,690
yeah, for sure. They get taken
down. It's like stand back.

886
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,590
They're just going to get back up.
And that's if you're not used to that,

887
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:45,540
that is problematic for you on top if you,
if you allow that situation to happen.

888
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:49,170
Yeah. Yeah. That's why it's good to
train with. I think I said this before,

889
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:53,850
good to train with MMA guys because
that's a lot of the time the case,

890
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:56,820
unless they're like straight up dude,
you too background guys. But you know,

891
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:00,570
you know guys who just
have essentially um, uh,

892
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,210
what do you call a freestyle
kind of style to them.

893
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:07,270
They and in a sense we do Jujitsu.
Yeah.

894
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,840
Anytime I train with them and they
don't like being on the bottom.

895
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:12,840
So you're going to get that training.
They're big time feed on the hips,

896
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,500
your head away and they're just
trying to get back up again. The,

897
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:21,530
the theme or the reason that all that
I have all this stuff in my head is

898
00:55:22,141 --> 00:55:27,100
because it's all about what game are you
playing, what game are you playing? And,

899
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,690
and again, Connor, that's one of the
things that everyone loves about Connor,

900
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:33,120
myself included,
is he goes in there to fight.

901
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:39,080
And yet that instinct of going forward
all the time against a guy that's a

902
00:55:39,301 --> 00:55:43,470
superior wrestler and Grappler, which
could be certainly is. And like I said,

903
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,620
grappling broadly stated is
superior to striking in a,

904
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,960
in a one on one situation.
Yeah. Do you look hesitant?

905
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:59,220
You know, I agree with that probably
more than you do. Oh, okay. Because,

906
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,430
and there's obviously, and I just had
someone hit me up on social media.

907
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:05,470
It was like, but what if, you
know, why don't you get punched on?

908
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,540
What if the striker can punch you
when you're trying to take him down?

909
00:56:07,541 --> 00:56:09,390
And like that the case has
gone through and through.

910
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:12,750
Can striker knock someone
out? Yes, they absolutely can.

911
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:16,650
They have a puncher's chance. Can you
rely on that? Hell No. You can't. Yeah.

912
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,560
Hell No. You can't. Yeah.
What were you going to say?
Yeah, that's it. I mean, yeah,

913
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:24,070
most of the time as far
as how it has played out.

914
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,630
Oh yeah. You, yeah, you can knock
the guy out. Oh yeah, for sure.

915
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,560
Yeah. Well, yeah, he can happen for
sure, but yeah, you just do the,

916
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:36,630
you run the statistics. No, it's like
way harder to plan a knock out on a,

917
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,070
on a breath for grappler to plan
a submission was way easier.

918
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,780
Even in grappling tournaments
they've got would be like, Hey,

919
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:46,510
I'm going to go and I'm going to
get this guy in a rear naked choke.

920
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:50,980
That's what I'm going to do. And against
another grappler by the way. So yeah,

921
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:53,380
it's way, it's way easier to plan
because it's way more methodical.

922
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:57,400
It's like way less. Like, what do you call
it, like chaotic and don't get it wrong.

923
00:56:57,410 --> 00:57:01,120
Like strikers know how to control
their environment. I dig it. Yeah.

924
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,020
But just the nature of what it is, you
know, there, there's no, there's no doubt.

925
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:06,640
And again,

926
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,600
broadly speaking because I am totally
pro striking and you have to be able to

927
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:17,020
strike and you're, you're more time,
your boxing kills. The better they are,

928
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:20,200
the better you are as a human
being and I don't know if, yeah,

929
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:21,790
I mean if you've ever trained,

930
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,330
if anyone here doesn't believe in
striking it all go and train with somebody

931
00:57:25,331 --> 00:57:30,310
that's a really good high level
striker and they will jack you up. Yes,

932
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:32,560
they will jack you up.
You will be,

933
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:35,500
you will feel like a white belt
in Jujitsu on the map. Yes.

934
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,800
The only difference is if it's,
if you talk,

935
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:42,430
if you flip a switch and you make an MMA
and you can grab a hold of them. Yeah,

936
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,740
you can. You can all of a sudden
you can equalize it very quickly.

937
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:47,920
That's why Jujitsu came about that.
That's why, well not Mike came about.

938
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,800
That's why it came onto
the scene so strong.

939
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,010
It's because all of the striking stuff,
as awesome as it is,

940
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,030
we just saw another example
of it on Saturday night.

941
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,750
That's what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

942
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,890
And I'm not even saying
honor is a far superior.

943
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:07,210
If Connor is a phenomenal striker,
once he's on the ground,

944
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,300
he's on the ground in those strikes
don't mean anything anymore. Barely.

945
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,990
Especially these kids with like
super good grappling and you know,

946
00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:17,440
they can keep going. You know,
when you gas and it was this movie,

947
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,580
we'll go into kind of what your
strategy was. If a grappler,

948
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:25,480
is he a grappler? Gasses. And that goes
for anyone in a fight. If you gas out,

949
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:30,350
you're essentially ineffective. So
kind of that aside, the, well, the,

950
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,220
the reason that p that it seems like,
Oh yeah,

951
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:35,320
all of these guys like a Leo Machida,
right?

952
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,320
He was a big one who kind of exploded
onto the scene and just beat up everyone.

953
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,170
And he was a karate guy,
black belt in Jujitsu by the way.

954
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,480
But no one wants to talk about that part.

955
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,830
Or even like a chocolate l type
character where he's just knocking,

956
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:48,190
he's straight up knocking everybody
helicopters and everything.

957
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,540
Superior restaurant by the way. So it's
one of those things where it's like, yeah,

958
00:58:52,541 --> 00:58:56,140
if you don't know any grappling, oh
yeah, your, your chances of success,

959
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,820
especially as time goes
on, go, go way down. Um,

960
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,250
but most people if they're like primarily
striking or striking as their kind of

961
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:07,270
their, their success, you know,
that's what gives them success.

962
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:12,460
They have to learn even
like a few fundamentals in
grappling and get really good

963
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:15,220
at them. Just defensively
to start with. Start with.

964
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:18,430
But if you don't know anything, like
if you know how to defend the takedown,

965
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,100
that's grappling right there ready.
And if you get really good

966
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:26,000
at that, then okay, that's going to help
you a lot. But that's grappling. Now.

967
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:29,090
What if you essentially fail
at defending the take down?

968
00:59:29,091 --> 00:59:32,540
Meaning you get taken down, you have
to learn to get back up. If you don't,

969
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,950
you'll get hell done there.
Straight up.

970
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,380
If you don't like take a big strong guy
and just a normal size person, one knows,

971
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:42,770
knows you to put the big strong guy
on his back. Like even in guard Bro,

972
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,960
he won't get up. No. If the guy's
like, Hey, don't let him up,

973
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,320
you won't get up straight up.
He, and the harder he tries,

974
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,600
the less ability he's
going to have to get up.

975
00:59:50,601 --> 00:59:52,810
It's like throwing somebody in
the water who can't swim. Yeah.

976
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:56,210
And like he can't even tread water,
let alone swim.

977
00:59:56,211 --> 00:59:58,670
He can't try the try as hard as you can.
And the harder you try it,

978
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,890
the more it's just going to not work.

979
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,710
But you teach someone to just
tread water or he'll handle it.

980
01:00:04,711 --> 01:00:07,040
He'll handle a little bit. But you
just learned how to tread water though.

981
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,770
You learned how to swim a little bit.
So you've got to learn that stuff.

982
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,670
And what's Nice,

983
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:15,670
well you need to take this into account
is that the UFC rounds or are only five

984
01:00:16,371 --> 01:00:18,980
minutes.
So they're only five minutes,

985
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:21,530
which means you could see it took,

986
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,310
it took time for Connor's
good enough that it,

987
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,270
he's not getting like just caught you
made a quick mistake and get caught. No,

988
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:31,910
he's making a series of
mistakes that take time.

989
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,770
And then finally they get capitalized on.

990
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:38,730
If he can make it three minutes
on the feet every round May.

991
01:00:38,731 --> 01:00:41,740
And the chances of him getting
submitted in two minutes by Khabib,

992
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,780
especially when he was doing good
maneuvers on the bottom, bottom,

993
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,230
they're not really that good.
And you know,

994
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,200
can you make a mistake and get gay teens
that normally happens to the grappler

995
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:53,690
that's like grappler versus grappler.
I shoot on you.

996
01:00:53,691 --> 01:00:57,200
You grab the guillotine or I try
and post and you do an arm lock.

997
01:00:57,201 --> 01:01:01,760
That usually happens. Not from
most of those moves come out of me.

998
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:05,300
Me engaging in grappling with you,
not me getting away from you.

999
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:10,400
Me Getting away from you exposes
less of grappling submissions.

1000
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,660
Unless you do pour mistakes, like turn
your back, then you got a problem,

1001
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,520
you're going to have a,
you're going to have a problem.

1002
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:22,580
And I suppose we should
also talk about the, uh,

1003
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,560
the after situation after
the fight. Sure. And,

1004
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:32,480
uh, you know, Khabib, who's
normally very stoic and calm,

1005
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,500
he lost it. He ran out
in the crowd. Conner, uh,

1006
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,940
and I was watching in detail some of
these little clips and Conor was getting

1007
01:01:44,031 --> 01:01:48,710
nuts too. Let's, let's not make
any mistakes about it cause yeah.

1008
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,950
So,
and then the guy came in from Congress,

1009
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:56,060
from Khabib's team and soccer
punched Connor. That was gnarly.

1010
01:01:56,840 --> 01:02:00,410
And so what do I think of all that? Yeah.
It's horrible. Is it bad for the sport?

1011
01:02:00,411 --> 01:02:04,580
Yes, it's bad for the
sport. Um, interestingly,

1012
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:09,040
Joe Rogan posted that Brendan
Schaub kind of made a prediction.

1013
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:12,560
The predicts. Yeah. He made a prediction
that something was going to get crazy.

1014
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:17,630
Yeah. And that's, that was
accurate. What do I think about it?

1015
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:23,110
I think it was a bummer. Yeah. This is
a bummer. It's a bummer to see. I'm,

1016
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:27,930
I was surprised to see could be get
crazy like that. The fight was over.

1017
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,130
You could see that Connor was pretty
humble and defeat and he was sitting there

1018
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:35,160
like, hey, all right. Uh, that's a bummer.

1019
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:40,460
And Khabib got nuts for those moments
and I don't know what's going to happen.

1020
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,120
I don't know what's going to happen in
terms of, I know they didn't hate it.

1021
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:49,290
I don't think they paid him yet.
They didn't pay him his $2 million purse.

1022
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,030
Yeah. Wouldn't that be an athletic
commission thing? No. You, Oh yeah,

1023
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,650
it will definitely as the athletic,
yeah, they'll, they'll find them.

1024
01:02:55,651 --> 01:02:59,100
They'll take part of his purse and
that's just money. That's like, you know,

1025
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:03,900
when you pay a speeding ticket and the
state gets the money, it's the same thing.

1026
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:04,740
So they,

1027
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,910
the athlete that Nevada State Athletic
Commission could find him half as person,

1028
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:13,030
put 1.5 or no, he, he made $2 million
purse. He could put a mill. They,

1029
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:14,450
he could put the net.

1030
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:18,150
Nevada state athletic commission could
put $1 million in their pocket by saying,

1031
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:19,320
you,
you shouldn't have done that.

1032
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:22,410
Were finding you were finding you half
of your purse, boom. Here's $1 million.

1033
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:26,390
Let's build a new office
center office center.

1034
01:03:27,930 --> 01:03:31,200
So I don't know what's going to happen.
It's not good to see that.

1035
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,610
I wish everyone would be better
sports. Uh, that would be good.

1036
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:41,100
But the people are super emotional and
they haven't learned to control their

1037
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:42,060
emotions yet.

1038
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,580
Which brings me to the third point
that I wanted to talk about this week.

1039
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:49,193
What are you going to say?

1040
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,540
No, no, no. I dig it. But the,

1041
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,670
there is like a bigger kind
of picture here with the,

1042
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:58,510
it's sold anything that's quote
unquote bad for the sport. Right.

1043
01:03:58,511 --> 01:04:01,580
That's that that is something,
but there's two elements right there.

1044
01:04:01,581 --> 01:04:06,580
There's the growth of the sport and then
there's like promotion of the sport for

1045
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:10,960
the people who are in the, who were in
the game in a bad press is good press.

1046
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:15,100
Any press is good press.
There's a dichotomy. So yeah,

1047
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,700
the growth of the sport to the guy who
doesn't watch MMA cause it's so barbaric.

1048
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:21,940
We're watching. Okay. What will the
Pettis fight? Right. Same. Same event.

1049
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,990
Pedis and for example, yeah.
By the way, I like Ferguson.

1050
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:29,590
That dude's a hard worker. I like
Pettis too. Okay. And, and I,

1051
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:34,090
and I definitely liked Duke. Roufus
yeah, my boy, my boy there was, you know,

1052
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:37,120
we would be cornering people
backstage and Duke Rufus was always,

1053
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,950
I mean he hasn't probably
doesn't know anything.

1054
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,740
There's probably wouldn't even
barely know who I am at all,

1055
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,800
but he would always be like, super
cool dude. He's awesome. Yeah.

1056
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:52,270
So that fight Ben Pettis and Pettis is a
good dude too. You know, I liked pedis.

1057
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:57,490
Yeah. Really seems like it. Um, but that
was a bloody fight. Yeah, it was. So,

1058
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:00,760
and there's bloody fights every once
in all right guys with a huge gash is

1059
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:04,360
whatnot, so, okay. Bloody fight. Right.
And so me, my brother and my cousin,

1060
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:08,480
we were watching this fight and uh,

1061
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:11,650
so these guys are just basically
punching each other in the face,

1062
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:15,340
each other in the face, bleeding like
all over, you know, like super bloody.

1063
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:17,050
The kind of where they got to
stop the fight and be like, hey,

1064
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,540
check this guy that, you know,
so it gives you a, hey doc,

1065
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,790
hey timeout while we just clean
up blood off everyone. Yes.

1066
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:26,000
It'll take about a minute here. Just a
white blonde off everyone. Yeah. Yeah.

1067
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:29,200
And meanwhile we're just watching it
like, oh, whatever. Like, actually,

1068
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:34,180
it's like there have been more eventful
fights then this one, like it ended in a,

1069
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:35,740
you know,
he broke his hand or whatever and it was,

1070
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,840
and that was considered uneventful. I
broke his hand. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All I,

1071
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:43,390
the guy in the head stopped. Yeah, they
stopped the fight and that was uneventful.

1072
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:47,200
We consider that uneventful and eventful
fight is a guy who gets knocked out,

1073
01:05:47,201 --> 01:05:51,220
unconscious, flat out, which with which
happened, by the way, a few fights early.

1074
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:55,240
Anyway, so we're watching
this blood everywhere and
meanwhile we were like, okay,

1075
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:59,050
you know, like whatever. But so that,
my point is the growth of the sport.

1076
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,840
You get a guy who doesn't watch MMA,
they only watch, you know, basketball,

1077
01:06:01,841 --> 01:06:03,130
football,
the traditional sports,

1078
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:06,940
and they get a glimpse into MMA and
they see that all the blood and stuff,

1079
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:09,610
they're like, this is a dumb sport.
This is not even a sport. This is like,

1080
01:06:09,611 --> 01:06:12,370
this shouldn't be illegal.
This is like two human beings.

1081
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:13,780
And everyone shared meanwhile.
Okay.

1082
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:17,380
So when the fight stopped that that
pet is Ferguson fight, it stops. Right.

1083
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,550
They stop it. They, you know how
they cut to the crowd? Everyone.

1084
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:20,740
So I'll just see their reaction.

1085
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:24,040
There's like businessmen in their
suits drinking their drinks.

1086
01:06:24,041 --> 01:06:28,450
It's like the epitome of like gladiator
old school king with all the grapes and

1087
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,990
the stuff and high fiving and stuff.
Right? Meanwhile these two guys are like,

1088
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:34,390
one guy has a broken hand,
the other guy has bled off.

1089
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:37,840
Well they both have blood all over.
Right? So as an outsider looking in,

1090
01:06:37,841 --> 01:06:42,640
you're like, it's reasonable to expect
them to be like, this is, this is dumb.

1091
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,190
This is not a sport. I'm not going
to sign onto this at all. Okay.

1092
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:46,780
Then you get these posts,

1093
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:51,670
fight shenanigans could be even guys
jumping out of the ring into the crowd,

1094
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:54,630
continuing to fight after
he won, by the way. So that,

1095
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,540
and I'm not saying that this
is how I'm looking at it.

1096
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:59,650
I'm saying this is how an outsider, we'll
see it. Interesting. And then you see,

1097
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:03,850
you know, months ago, whatever,
Connor flying into New York
and busting up the bus.

1098
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,000
It could be even in, and it's this
thing and you know all this stuff,

1099
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:10,300
guys getting injured from
the broken glass, all this
stuff, right? It's a, it's a,

1100
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:13,960
it's not cool from an outsider looking in.
It's like this is not a sport.

1101
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:17,290
This is dumb. These guys aren't people,
these aren't civilized people, this stuff.

1102
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:22,300
But from the inside, man, I'm really
looking forward to this fight now.

1103
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,010
After caught, I did that then, you
know, then, uh, you know, things happen.

1104
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:29,620
Connor's talking all this
trash. It's like, oh, and he's
backing it up. Oh my gosh,

1105
01:07:29,621 --> 01:07:32,200
I want to see this even
more now if you get,

1106
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:35,080
and I like fader to or that's the fader.
I like him too.

1107
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:39,220
What if everyone was like fate or though
there will be a lot of fights that you

1108
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:42,250
just don't care about. You'd be
like, Hey, all right, cool. Or,

1109
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:45,610
but on the flip question, cause I
would, I would care about all of them.

1110
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:49,660
You would not care about you care about
them left last. I think we'll meet you.

1111
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:53,830
I Dunno. I Dunno what you care
about sometimes, but the people,

1112
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:57,930
the reason, fate or his fate
or to the extent that faders,

1113
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,760
faders cause because other people are
not like for you to compare him to

1114
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:01,271
everyone else,

1115
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:03,760
it gets all crazy and he just sits there
and looks at him and then knocks him

1116
01:08:03,761 --> 01:08:06,220
out or chokes him out.
Cause when you think about it,

1117
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,160
isn't that really the martial art spirit?
For sure.

1118
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:13,780
Super Stoic and that's how it
has been. Yeah. But now, hey,

1119
01:08:13,781 --> 01:08:17,480
martial arts, let's face it, when
you're in the game, if you watch MMA,

1120
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,430
especially USC, if you
watch this, this is,

1121
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:25,100
it goes like the martial arts spirit
of the thing is very small, very small.

1122
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,010
This is a show. You don't get it wrong.
This is a show with real punches,

1123
01:08:28,011 --> 01:08:31,740
real kicks, blood, all that
stuff. And this is all part
of the show. What happened?

1124
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:36,741
I definitely think of it more as a sport
than I do think of it as a display of

1125
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,880
martial arts for the community.
I'm not thinking of it that way anymore.

1126
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:43,010
It's a sport.
But I would even go beyond the sport.

1127
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,920
It's a show straight up
because if it was just a sport,

1128
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,240
you know what they did for the first time.

1129
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:51,560
I don't know if you noticed as you
probably did, they had like fog on the,

1130
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:55,610
on the octagon explore. Yeah.
I was like only for Connor.

1131
01:08:55,611 --> 01:09:00,170
The dry ice dry ice effect.
Right? Yeah. Really like you.

1132
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:03,830
What do you think? I give that the
Nega tron there was a while where it,

1133
01:09:03,831 --> 01:09:06,020
UFC was trying to lean
towards the other direction.

1134
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:09,740
They took away all the show stuff and
they made it look like more like a sporty

1135
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:13,880
and now graph. Kind of going
back a little bit. Yeah man.

1136
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:17,180
It's because the new owners took over.
Well yeah.

1137
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:20,270
And you know that was obviously like a
quote unquote branding play. You know,

1138
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:22,800
we want to kind of go mainstream with
the sport edge of it and you know,

1139
01:09:22,801 --> 01:09:25,430
make it a kind of a wholesale. Here's the
thing Brad, it's not a wholesome thing.

1140
01:09:25,750 --> 01:09:27,100
Like it's totally,
there's a difference.

1141
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:31,130
We need scoring a ball in a basket or
running across the end zone or the goal

1142
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:33,800
line for a touchdown and all this
stuff out running guys trying to just

1143
01:09:33,801 --> 01:09:38,660
basically talk you to the
ground and there's a difference
between that being the

1144
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:42,260
goal and the goal being to hurt the
guy as bad as he possibly can or they

1145
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,350
incapacitate them as bad
as you probably know.

1146
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:47,570
Something I said on when I was on
Joe Rogan's podcast is I was like,

1147
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:52,220
if you go watch where any of those
other sports, when they escalate,

1148
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:55,340
they escalate to what you actually
want to see, which is MMA.

1149
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,940
Like what happens when a basketball
game gets a little too rough?

1150
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,530
They fight each other. What happens
when hockey gets a little bit,

1151
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:04,400
they fight each other. What happens when
football gets a little bit too rough?

1152
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:08,000
They fight. Even baseball.
Someone, someone does something
out of line in baseball,

1153
01:10:08,001 --> 01:10:11,600
they fight each other. Yes, let's just
get rid of the ball, get rid of the net.

1154
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:16,460
You get rid of the hockey stick and just
loves I get it on. Yeah. And that's, yeah,

1155
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:19,490
that's why, and that's, I mean, obviously
that's a whole whole nother thing,

1156
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:20,690
but if you,

1157
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:25,370
and I'm not saying there's necessarily
a confusion between it like us,

1158
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:27,890
the sport in the show and the
martial arts and all that,

1159
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:28,640
but I'm just saying there,

1160
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:32,990
there are three different elements
and they just gave me a whole like

1161
01:10:32,991 --> 01:10:35,900
interesting idea.
So sometimes for me,

1162
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,060
I'm so functional,

1163
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:43,420
like I operate and such a functional
mindset that it's doesn't even work,

1164
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,490
right? It just doesn't work. It
doesn't work with normal people. Like,

1165
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:53,510
Hey, just like, no, this is just going to
be, uh, we're just going to be playing.

1166
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:57,740
If I was,
if I was in charge of the entire UFC,

1167
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,810
what would it look like? And it would
probably be just be so functional.

1168
01:11:02,990 --> 01:11:04,520
They'd be the extreme that you would,

1169
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:06,320
that you're saying people
would just be like,

1170
01:11:06,321 --> 01:11:08,570
I don't really know if I want
to watch this. And however,

1171
01:11:08,571 --> 01:11:13,571
I would say if you dug deep into the
training methodologies and you understood

1172
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:17,120
the people,
which UFC does a decent job now with the,

1173
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:19,380
what's it called when they're
leading up to the fight,

1174
01:11:19,381 --> 01:11:24,200
they embed it so you could watch the
embedded, you get to see kind of, it's,

1175
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:28,710
it's not highly edited,
embedded and you get to see what,

1176
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,880
but I would,
you know,

1177
01:11:29,881 --> 01:11:34,650
for me I would make the whole thing
would be like functional. It'd be like,

1178
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:38,490
oh, there'll be lights that show
you everyone and we call her lights.

1179
01:11:38,491 --> 01:11:42,030
Why would you need color lights? You know
what I mean? You definitely fired. Yeah,

1180
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:43,980
no we wouldn't do that.
You'd want to get fired up.

1181
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:46,290
You see the guy walking
into the gauge that's about,

1182
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:50,430
that's about to fight another human being.
It doesn't work that way though.

1183
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,420
I know like the,
even if it,

1184
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:59,040
again go back to everyone being stoic
and it'd be like it'd be reduced.

1185
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:03,390
It would be less of a show and in fact
you might even argue that it's kind of

1186
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:08,010
has, we've seen that before. Like in just
like other, like you ever watch like,

1187
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,950
uh, like a karate tournament
or something like that.

1188
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,400
It's like they don't develop characters
or nothing like that. They're just,

1189
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:16,770
this is guy and hey, this
guy's good. And so like, cool.

1190
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:19,500
I want to see what he's good at.
And then you sort of forget about it.

1191
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:24,020
You don't anticipate that unless
you're way, way in the game. But my,

1192
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,470
my personal,
uh,

1193
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,510
vision doesn't always line up well with
like the drama creation that everyone

1194
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:39,990
else likes. Yeah. But that's,
that's literally life. That's why,

1195
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:42,800
that's why you want to
watch it because of poplar,

1196
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:46,370
a big part of it is because of the
John Chael Sonnen wise man. Right?

1197
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,730
Said one time,
once one fight ends,

1198
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,040
that's when the promotion for the
next fight begins. So that, you know,

1199
01:12:53,070 --> 01:12:54,870
when he gets on the mic
after the fight is done,

1200
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:58,680
he's essentially promoting the next
week. And, but, and the thing is, it's,

1201
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:02,490
it's totally proven. Like even like
someone saying, why do you care why?

1202
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,920
Like people were coming to you saying,
why are you supporting Connor?

1203
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:09,120
He's such a bad role model.
All of that. That's all good
stuff. Like, well, if they,

1204
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:11,900
if they were like, Oh, who's that guy
caught it, will you support this? Hey,

1205
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:16,200
let me look into this guy. That's a
failure. But yeah, to love him, hate him.

1206
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:20,070
The thing is if I dislike
a guy and there's guys that
I disliked, I understand.

1207
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:24,660
I don't dislike them as people. I dislike,
dislike what we call the UFC character.

1208
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:27,300
You don't like the guy that that's
on the mic and doing that, whatever.

1209
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:30,120
I'm just not a fan actually.
I'm the anti-fat I want him to lose.

1210
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:32,850
Like if he's fighting a
guy, unless I don't know the
other guy. It's interesting.

1211
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:37,350
You know what I think kind of changed
my perspective a little bit is like Tito

1212
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,660
Ortiz, he had this, he has a horrible,

1213
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,320
his reputation was always like he was
a jerk and all this stuff. Bed. Yeah,

1214
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:47,550
he was a WWE. He'll, yeah. And,
and I didn't know him well,

1215
01:13:47,551 --> 01:13:49,830
but I mean I trained with
him psalm and you know,

1216
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:51,480
Dean Jean Dean train with them a lot.

1217
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:56,100
So I kind of knew and by proxy and
Tito Ortiz as a dude, as I could,

1218
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:59,550
just a dude outside of that whole world
and totally cool and totally good to go.

1219
01:13:59,660 --> 01:14:02,220
You know,
totally coined a Bisping is the same way.

1220
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:06,560
Like this being kind of a heel.
I've met Bisman got trained with Brisbane.

1221
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:09,900
Bisman is totally good dude. You know,
trains, hard, hard work, great work ethic.

1222
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,740
Good. I, and I'm saying again,

1223
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:14,830
I don't want to make it sound like I
know these guys and I'm all boroughs with

1224
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,990
them cause I'm not, but I've trained
with him, I've been on the mat with them.

1225
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:17,171
You know,

1226
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:22,171
like I know I can understand
their character outside
of the character that they

1227
01:14:23,561 --> 01:14:28,360
play on TV and the character that they
have. And maybe that's why for me,

1228
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:33,220
when I look at Conor and I see all this
stuff, I look at it and I think, yeah,

1229
01:14:33,221 --> 01:14:37,930
you know what behind that it's going to
be another guy that's a hard worker that

1230
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,810
wants to win and take care of his
family. Like, oh, okay. And he's got,

1231
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:45,310
he's doing some stuff and he's talking
about red panties and you know, he just,

1232
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,830
that's what he's doing. Cause,
and I look at it the same way.

1233
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:49,780
I see a guy like Bisbing,

1234
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,200
a guy like Tito Ortiz who are behind that,

1235
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,710
that front that they put up,
they're just,

1236
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:59,170
they're just hardworking guys
that like to fight. Yeah.

1237
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,950
But I don't see Conor as a bad guy as
the heel though. Connie was a good guy.

1238
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:07,510
He's like, he's anti opponent.
Like he'll, he'll really kind of,

1239
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:12,730
he'll talk bad about his opponent. Not
necessarily bad, like necessarily bad,

1240
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,910
but you know, he'll talk himself
up over his opponent kind of thing.

1241
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,810
But he's not like,

1242
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:20,740
like Bisbing will actively just like
chill sona and just like Tito Ortiz

1243
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:25,960
actively play the bad guy to the point
where they will be categorized as that.

1244
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,360
Oh yeah.
People will make about,

1245
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:31,360
this is the thing about the stuff that
[inaudible] was saying about Anderson

1246
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,390
Silva. Yeah. You just,
yeah, that was crazy.

1247
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:36,950
And chill son's a good
example even though Chelsea,

1248
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:38,910
you can tell by that cause
you guys like you ever touch,

1249
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,320
I did stuff with Chelsea video watch,
right.

1250
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:46,440
And like full on accommodating like overly
polite person in ways that he doesn't

1251
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:50,140
have to do that. You don't have to
do this plate stuff. So he's an,

1252
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:54,490
he's one of those guys. But I could tell
like, okay, this is the show and I get it.

1253
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:58,000
And actually I dig it. Um, like Bisping,

1254
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,970
I was genuinely surprised how nice he was.
I did a video with this being,

1255
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:03,460
if you want to look at it,
very funny video to by the way,

1256
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:05,890
which one did you do with Biz? Bang?
His head not deliver on just show,

1257
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:09,360
I forget what episode, but
we put oh yeah, they did.

1258
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:13,460
Yeah he was, he played, uh,

1259
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,710
the main guy to snatch the movie.
You're right. But didn't call,

1260
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:22,510
he didn't call it snatch what you call
it snatched. He snatched. It's good.

1261
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,130
He doesn't really get up. So it's, it's,

1262
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:28,300
Michael has Bisping Kit Dale is Tommy.

1263
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:32,740
And then hit not do is, let me ask you
this. Kenny Florian. Kenny Florian,

1264
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:35,610
when you did the heat,
he's yeah.

1265
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:39,810
That he's got some chops.
Straight up acting chops. Yes.

1266
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:44,500
Kenny Florian shout out.
Yes. Yeah. Straight up acting
chops. So Kenny Florian,

1267
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:46,420
not to go too deep into that,
but Kay.

1268
01:16:46,421 --> 01:16:50,470
So on top of that Kenny Florian
is super nice too. Yeah. Nice.

1269
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:53,700
He got tested with, with us, with me, um,

1270
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:57,350
on how nice he could be as
far as tolerance. So we go
up there, right? Oh this,

1271
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:01,270
you have to reshoot the whole
thing. Two cameras, right.

1272
01:17:01,271 --> 01:17:03,070
We get and so you know,

1273
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:07,000
one angle and him one ain't going
hand out to the angle on him.

1274
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,380
The camera just didn't work.

1275
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:12,200
Something with the SD card or whatever
this and we've totally had to like get

1276
01:17:12,201 --> 01:17:17,060
access to the restaurant after hours
and like all this stuff schedule with

1277
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:19,040
Kenny.
Not to mention who is like,

1278
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:22,250
this is like after he crossed
over into straight up mainstream,

1279
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,460
you can't just get Kenny Florian off.
He, you know, he had shows in like,

1280
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:30,170
he's kind of a high level guy
at this time and I get home,

1281
01:17:30,171 --> 01:17:32,690
like we're, you know, we're editing and
I'm like, we got her, there's no choice.

1282
01:17:32,691 --> 01:17:36,800
We've got to re shoot this thing. And
then, oh, we're like man, Kenny Florida,

1283
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:40,830
like whatever. He's like, yeah, cool.
Let's go. Go like reshape. He had a goatee

1284
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:46,420
when a dean and I were doing the trials
for ADCC in 2002 for the 2003 80 cc,

1285
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,440
Ken Flo came out and he was one of
the competitors. And you, same thing,

1286
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:56,110
like we didn't really know him that well,
but no,

1287
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:58,820
we were all kind of like a black belt.
She's and all that stuff.

1288
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:03,770
So actually I wasn't a black belt at
that time. I was a brown belt, but we,

1289
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:07,160
you know, everyone was just like super
cool. Yeah, the dean was a brown belt.

1290
01:18:07,161 --> 01:18:11,420
What am I talking about? I
was a purple belt. All right.

1291
01:18:11,421 --> 01:18:14,840
So where this whole thing goes from,

1292
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:18,130
and this is interesting that you
brought this up. There's the,

1293
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,760
now the other thing I
wanted to talk about,

1294
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:24,620
which is this idea of attack detachment,

1295
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,840
which talk about all the time.

1296
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:28,220
Yeah.

1297
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:33,220
And I've seen like another
little reveal on detachment.

1298
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:37,370
Maybe another angle. Okay. So picture
this black belt versus a white belt.

1299
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:39,380
You're training Jujitsu.

1300
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,780
The white belt is like
grabbing your sleeve.

1301
01:18:46,660 --> 01:18:47,460
Okay.

1302
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,980
Or grabbing your belt or grabbing it,
like doing something.

1303
01:18:50,610 --> 01:18:53,010
Whatever he's doing doesn't matter.

1304
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:56,760
And it will not affect the outcome at all.

1305
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:02,610
And I see. And so what should
you do as, as a black belt, as a,

1306
01:19:02,700 --> 01:19:03,780
as a better grappler,

1307
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:05,850
what are you gonna do when someone's
doing something that doesn't matter?

1308
01:19:05,851 --> 01:19:07,860
What do you do? You just kind
of ignore it. It's like, okay,

1309
01:19:07,861 --> 01:19:11,880
that's not gonna affect the outcome. I'm
not going to worry about it. As leaders,

1310
01:19:11,881 --> 01:19:16,881
I see people getting caught up all the
times in little things that will not

1311
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:20,190
affect the outcome unless they let it.

1312
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:26,150
So I see some white belt blow
them in the chain of command.

1313
01:19:26,151 --> 01:19:29,400
It's going all crazy. Grabbing their
sleeve and this leader on the top,

1314
01:19:29,401 --> 01:19:33,720
like gets concerned about it and puts
time and effort into something that

1315
01:19:33,721 --> 01:19:38,160
doesn't matter whether it's
a little personality, Rob,
a little key go uprising.

1316
01:19:39,160 --> 01:19:42,270
It's, should we do it this way or should
we do it that way? Doesn't matter.

1317
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:44,790
That's a little sleeve grab.
It doesn't matter.

1318
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:50,150
And I see people getting caught up on
things that don't matter all the time.

1319
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:56,120
And what I've realized is it's something
that I figured out a long time ago.

1320
01:19:58,201 --> 01:20:00,660
I don't know when, but a long time
ago I figured out, you know what?

1321
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,750
That thing doesn't matter. I'm not going
to worry about it. That's the thing.

1322
01:20:03,751 --> 01:20:06,000
Doesn't matter. I'm not going to worry
about it. That thing doesn't matter.

1323
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:09,960
I'm not going to worry about that thing
matters. I'm going to focus on that thing

1324
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:16,050
and that makes, that
makes a big a big, big,

1325
01:20:16,051 --> 01:20:17,220
big difference.
It's,

1326
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:20,330
it's leadership capital because if I'm
investing my leadership capital and

1327
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,420
getting your hand off my sleeve or trying
to do it my way instead of your way or

1328
01:20:24,421 --> 01:20:27,840
trying to keep your ego in check if
that's what I'm investing my leadership

1329
01:20:27,841 --> 01:20:31,500
capitalists, I have nothing left to invest
in the thing that's actually matters.

1330
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:34,350
Just like if you're a black belt and
someone guys grabbing your sleeve and you

1331
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:38,010
focus on pulling that and off your whole
time you're going to waste energy and

1332
01:20:38,011 --> 01:20:39,510
maybe even give up position cause your,

1333
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:43,050
cause you were focused on
something that did not matter.

1334
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:48,500
So it is important to realize and to
learn to differentiate between things that

1335
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:51,960
don't matter and things that do matter.

1336
01:20:53,570 --> 01:20:55,940
And in order to tell the difference
between those two things,

1337
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,550
you have to be able to detach

1338
01:21:00,170 --> 01:21:04,160
and step back.
And obviously this is the same thing,

1339
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,970
not just with Jujitsu, not just with
leadership, not just with combat.

1340
01:21:07,971 --> 01:21:10,700
Cause it's the same thing in combat.
You're going to have things that don't,

1341
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:12,830
things are happening on the
battlefield that don't matter.

1342
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:16,130
Little Hey guys move in here instead
of there. That doesn't matter. Oh,

1343
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:18,890
this guy's moving there. So it doesn't
matter. The is doing this. Okay,

1344
01:21:18,891 --> 01:21:21,860
it doesn't matter. Oh wait, the enemy
did that thing that matters. Well,

1345
01:21:21,861 --> 01:21:24,020
one of my guys did this
thing that matters.

1346
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,610
So how do you learn to
discriminate between the two?

1347
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:32,660
You have to be able to detach from it.
That's what you have to do.

1348
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,700
You have to be able to detach and

1349
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:35,890
okay,

1350
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:39,250
if you,
if you don't learn to detach,

1351
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:43,840
you're going to constantly get tripped
up on things that don't really matter.

1352
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,000
And I'll tell you,
the more,

1353
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:52,440
the better you get.
The last things matter.

1354
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,070
Yeah.

1355
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:56,380
The better you get,
the last things matter

1356
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:03,130
and the better you get, the more the more
important things matter. Hmm. So you,

1357
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:06,190
you end up just wasting no energy
on things that don't matter.

1358
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:09,610
And focusing all your energy
on things that actually matter.

1359
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:13,270
And this is the difference, man.
This is how you win in Jujitsu.

1360
01:22:13,271 --> 01:22:15,580
This is how you win as a leader.
This is how you're winning combat.

1361
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,990
And this is truly how you win in life.
Think about all the things you don't,

1362
01:22:19,991 --> 01:22:21,940
what you used to talk about a lot.
You haven't done it in a while.

1363
01:22:21,941 --> 01:22:25,930
You just talk about distractions,
how things can distract you. Right?

1364
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:27,970
That's totally true.
That's what I'm talking about.

1365
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,720
The things that distract you
from what actually matters.

1366
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,180
So you have to,

1367
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,380
you have to figure out how
to detach from those things.

1368
01:22:38,650 --> 01:22:43,650
I was doing some reading as is her
norm shows a guy named Keith Douglas.

1369
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:49,480
He was a British soldier, World
War II. He's kind of a bad ass.

1370
01:22:49,481 --> 01:22:54,481
He was stuck in an administrative position
in October of 1942 during the second

1371
01:22:55,361 --> 01:23:00,040
battle of El Alamein. And so he was
stuck in this administrative position,

1372
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:03,460
so he just went AWOL and went to the front
line and join the fight and got after

1373
01:23:03,461 --> 01:23:05,590
it.
And one of the things that wrote,

1374
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:11,640
he said to be sentimental or emotional
now is dangerous to oneself and to

1375
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:16,750
others.
So what is he talking about?

1376
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:20,230
You can't get emotional.
You can't get sentimental.

1377
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,420
You can't get caught up in
things that don't matter.

1378
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:26,260
After his return from Africa.
This Guy Keith Douglas,

1379
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,070
he wrote a book about his experience.
Here's a little excerpt, can kind of

1380
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,160
think about what this guy has been
through that taught him these lessons.

1381
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:39,910
Here we go.
As I came up to them,

1382
01:23:39,911 --> 01:23:44,170
I recognized one of them as Robin,
the observation officer,

1383
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:47,260
whose aid I had been asking
for earlier in the day.

1384
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,230
I recognized his fleece lines,

1385
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:55,150
fleece lined suede waistcoat and
polished brass shoulder titles,

1386
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,600
and then his face strained and tired with
pain in his left foot was smashed to a

1387
01:24:01,901 --> 01:24:05,650
pulp mingled with the remainder of a boot.

1388
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:10,690
But as I spoke to Robin saying,
have you got a tourniquet robbin?

1389
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,890
He answered apologetically.
I'm afraid I haven't, Keith.

1390
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,500
I looked at the second ma'am,

1391
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:23,790
only his clothes distinguished
him as a human being.

1392
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,400
His face had gone
in place of,

1393
01:24:29,401 --> 01:24:32,490
it was a huge yellow vegetable.

1394
01:24:34,580 --> 01:24:39,580
The eyes blinked in it without lashes
and a grotesque huge mouth dribbled and

1395
01:24:43,171 --> 01:24:46,620
moaned like a child exhausted with crying.

1396
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:53,910
Okay.

1397
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:58,910
So there's an example of a horrible
situation that you have to learn to detach

1398
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:06,000
and you have to be able to focus
on things that actually matter.

1399
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:08,190
Because as Keith Douglas said,

1400
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:13,191
to be sentimental or emotional now is
dangerous to oneself and to others.

1401
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:18,850
Now, as I was digging into a little
bit of Keith Douglas and we'll,

1402
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,230
we'll get to Keith Douglas
fully on the podcast, but he,

1403
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,330
he added to that line,

1404
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:29,010
he added another line that
I want to hit as well.

1405
01:25:29,011 --> 01:25:32,910
To be sentimental or emotional now is
dangerous to one's self and to others.

1406
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,480
And he continues to trust anyone or
to admit any hope of a better world.

1407
01:25:39,331 --> 01:25:41,400
It's criminally foolish,

1408
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:46,740
as foolish as it is to
stop working for it.

1409
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:55,910
So I, you know,

1410
01:25:55,911 --> 01:26:00,620
that's a little tangent, that's
a tangent, but it's powerful.

1411
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:02,870
And like I said,

1412
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,960
we'll get to Keith Douglas as book and
that book got published after the war and

1413
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:13,820
unfortunately Keith Douglas never saw
that book get published because he was

1414
01:26:13,821 --> 01:26:18,821
killed by an enemy mortar fire on June
9th just a few days into the d day

1415
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:21,770
invasion of Normandy,
which he took part in.

1416
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:25,790
But again,

1417
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:30,791
luckily he left us a a lesson
which is to control your emotions.

1418
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:36,230
And I think as a,
as a person ended up as an individual,

1419
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:42,190
if you can start trying to discriminate
between things that matter and things

1420
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:44,090
that don't matter

1421
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,580
and the way that you do that is
by detaching from everything.

1422
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:53,660
And then you can pay attention to,
you can assess logically,

1423
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:56,840
not emotionally what's
important and what's not and
you focus on the things that

1424
01:26:56,841 --> 01:27:01,760
matter and it's going to make
your entire life a lot easier.

1425
01:27:01,761 --> 01:27:04,280
It's a great lesson from Keith Douglas

1426
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,513
and

1427
01:27:09,170 --> 01:27:12,230
I think that's all I've got for today.

1428
01:27:12,231 --> 01:27:14,210
I will say that speaking of lessons,

1429
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:19,820
I've got a little lesson
to pass on in a book,

1430
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:24,140
in a forthcoming book.
It's called Mikey and the dragons.

1431
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:30,440
And
if you didn't hear about the book yet,

1432
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:34,310
Miking the dragons about a young kid
that's scared of everything and that makes

1433
01:27:34,311 --> 01:27:38,900
his life pretty hard, pretty miserable
because he's scared of everything.

1434
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,030
And one day he finds a book

1435
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:47,460
and one day he, he scared of
everything he finds this book and,

1436
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:51,320
and, and there's a book within the book
and the story and we'll go into the book

1437
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:53,300
within the book right here real quick.

1438
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,130
And then one day Mike,
he noticed a book,

1439
01:27:58,850 --> 01:28:00,710
he opened it up and took a quick look.

1440
01:28:01,340 --> 01:28:05,870
It had pictures of dragons with things
like a snake and all kinds of scary

1441
01:28:05,871 --> 01:28:07,610
things that made Mikey shake.

1442
01:28:08,810 --> 01:28:13,790
But in the pictures there was a boy too
who didn't look scared but like he knew

1443
01:28:13,791 --> 01:28:17,670
what to do.
And even though Mikey was scared in deed,

1444
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:22,430
he decided that he would give the
book a read. He opened the first page,

1445
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:27,431
which he eagerly read and this is what
the dragon book said there once was a

1446
01:28:29,091 --> 01:28:33,140
kingdom long ago and far away on the
kingdom had suffered a horrible day.

1447
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:35,990
Their protector and leader there king,
he had died.

1448
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:41,030
And when they found out the whole
village cried when the king was alive.

1449
01:28:41,031 --> 01:28:42,260
He was a powerful force.

1450
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,850
Now they took the dead king
away by carriage and horse.

1451
01:28:47,690 --> 01:28:50,240
They knew they would miss
him and that made them sad.

1452
01:28:50,510 --> 01:28:52,700
But there was something else
that made them feel bad.

1453
01:28:52,970 --> 01:28:57,970
The king had always been so strong and
brave and protected the kingdom from the

1454
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,510
Dragon Cave.

1455
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:03,900
The Dragon Cave was just over the and
filled with scary dragons that were ready

1456
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:04,734
to kill.

1457
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:12,070
And the story continues from there and
explains that no one in the village in

1458
01:29:13,941 --> 01:29:17,600
the kingdom would stand up to the dragons
except the young prince who's only

1459
01:29:17,601 --> 01:29:21,830
seven years old.
And he's nervous and he's scared.

1460
01:29:22,460 --> 01:29:23,540
He's know if he can handle it,

1461
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,960
but he kind of realizes
he's gonna have to step up.

1462
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,000
So he goes to his father's war chest.

1463
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:36,130
I'm so happy that I could put the word
war chest in a book and he finds the

1464
01:29:37,981 --> 01:29:41,930
shield and he finds the sword of his
dad and they're both super heavy.

1465
01:29:44,170 --> 01:29:46,360
But then he also finds a little note,

1466
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:49,210
a little note from his father,

1467
01:29:49,211 --> 01:29:52,930
the king that explains how
to overcome the dragons.

1468
01:29:53,770 --> 01:29:56,800
So even though this book is aimed at kids,

1469
01:29:56,801 --> 01:30:00,100
I think we all know that we
all have dragons to fight.

1470
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:04,540
And like I said on the last podcast,

1471
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:09,250
I really wanted to get this book into
the hands of kids and really into the

1472
01:30:09,251 --> 01:30:12,250
hands of everyone.
But again,

1473
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:18,030
my publisher told me that there was no
scenario where this book gets published

1474
01:30:18,311 --> 01:30:21,850
by November. So what did I do? Um,

1475
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:26,290
I started my own publishing company
and the book will be out in November.

1476
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:30,370
So yeah, it's, it's actually
getting printed at this time.

1477
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,980
And in order to pull this off,

1478
01:30:33,370 --> 01:30:36,190
in order to actually know how
many books I need to print,

1479
01:30:36,250 --> 01:30:39,880
I think it already looks like I need to
print more books because you all ordered

1480
01:30:39,881 --> 01:30:42,630
a lot of them already. So thank you. Uh,

1481
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,880
preorder so that I know what to print so
I can print enough of the sacred first

1482
01:30:49,691 --> 01:30:53,350
the dish.
If you want,

1483
01:30:53,470 --> 01:30:58,470
you and your kids and your family
to know how to crush their dragons.

1484
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:05,920
Appreciate it. Uh, going to need
that. That's what's going to happen.

1485
01:31:06,190 --> 01:31:08,950
We're going to go forward together
and slay dragons in this case.

1486
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:13,930
Who's the Dragon? Well, you know, big
publishing companies and sometimes,

1487
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:18,100
uh,
anyways,

1488
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:22,180
we all have our dragons to fight and

1489
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,673
yeah,

1490
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:28,190
when we fight our dragons, well I dunno,
maybe sometimes we could use some help.

1491
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,480
Sure.
Echo.

1492
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:33,320
Sometimes you don't even know any way
that we could maybe get some help fighting

1493
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:37,980
on dragons. Yeah. So
dragons, the dragons. Sure.

1494
01:31:37,981 --> 01:31:42,650
Dragons. Sure. Our Dragon.
Yeah. So I'll tell you this,

1495
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,000
this,
and this might help.

1496
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:49,030
This will help actually if you realize
to the full extent that capability,

1497
01:31:50,780 --> 01:31:55,220
capability and knowledge that
will help you fight the dragons.

1498
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:59,920
Those two things are
imperative in fighting. Yeah.

1499
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:04,880
So we're staying on the path.
That's the capability part.

1500
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:09,220
Actually the path is both at the street.
Half covers all, yeah. Capability,

1501
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:11,650
knowledge,
always trying to improve.

1502
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:16,510
So every step forward on the path
is a step forward in capability,

1503
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:20,770
knowledge, check, check, as
opposed to the slippery slope,

1504
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:24,730
which is a step backwards capability
and knowledge to be careful on that one.

1505
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,500
Yes. So what, what capability, right?
This preparation, execution results,

1506
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,970
right. Just made that up right now.
Literally couldn't, could be flawed,

1507
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:36,640
but whatever. Sounds good to
me. So, so staying on the path,

1508
01:32:36,641 --> 01:32:38,790
what start would you do
to, of course, good place.

1509
01:32:39,180 --> 01:32:42,760
Did you do to good universal
kind of overarching. Yeah.

1510
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:47,710
How many people hit you up a day?
That just started Jujitsu a lot.

1511
01:32:47,890 --> 01:32:52,690
And what I started doing,
trying to do is everyone that's,

1512
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:55,060
that's indicating, they just
started. You'd get to first day,

1513
01:32:55,130 --> 01:32:57,700
you get to a second day, do you get
through, just got my kid into Judith.

1514
01:32:57,820 --> 01:33:02,680
I just retweet it and be like,
boom, you're in the game.
Just letting people know,

1515
01:33:02,681 --> 01:33:07,420
hey look, here's another person. All
different types of scenarios too,

1516
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:09,040
by the way. Different types. Here's the,

1517
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:13,870
here's what I run into his old 12
years old, 29 years old, bad back,

1518
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:18,280
uh, you know, hurt elbow. I'm
a surgeon, I'm a firefighter,

1519
01:33:18,281 --> 01:33:23,120
I'm a police officer, I'm
a CEO. It doesn't matter.
Good. Jump in the game. Yeah.

1520
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:27,460
All good. And every once in
a while we'll see this. Yes.

1521
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:29,730
Got My kids into git. You
know, one of them, I hope,

1522
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,310
I wish it was maybe a little
bit more into it, you know,

1523
01:33:33,610 --> 01:33:36,160
like what should I do or something
or whatever. Maybe not even that.

1524
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:36,994
They just said

1525
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,950
you jumped in there because a
lot of times it's like, oh yeah,

1526
01:33:41,951 --> 01:33:45,830
this is perfect for my kid. Oh
yeah. If she wants to jump in, if,

1527
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:50,920
if you're, if you're taking your kids
to Jujitsu and you're not participating,

1528
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:54,580
we've got an issue. Yeah. Let's, let's
at the very least just consider that.

1529
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:59,470
Just consider it. Think you're saying
Japan. Yeah. Get it. Get it. Yeah man.

1530
01:33:59,860 --> 01:34:00,200
I had a,

1531
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:05,200
a cool guy come into the gym here and
was in a police officer and he had his

1532
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:09,700
kids all fired up. You know, all the
kids are into it. They're so fired up.

1533
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:12,700
That's awesome. I was like, Oh, you know,
what class are you going to? He's like,

1534
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:17,380
whoa. Guilt tripped him immediately.
Level seven guilt trip. I was like, Bro,

1535
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:21,010
are you kidding me? Come on and get on
the mat. So he's in the game though. Yeah.

1536
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:24,160
So, and, and that's not like
that rare of a story because,

1537
01:34:24,161 --> 01:34:28,120
and even just how our gym is laid out,
where you know the kids classes going on,

1538
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:31,090
hey, just, just look right behind
you right now. Look right behind you.

1539
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:35,640
That's not adults going on. Yeah. So
you can just let, let your kids go.

1540
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:37,660
I know you want to watch the kids.
You want to see what up.

1541
01:34:37,690 --> 01:34:39,220
You want to see what's going on.
Don't worry about that.

1542
01:34:39,221 --> 01:34:43,390
They're going to be five of them. You
know they got it. They got it, Dave.

1543
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:46,320
They got it. They got those kids on
lock unlock in a good way, by the way,

1544
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,600
and just turned around.
There's just jumping down right there.

1545
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,600
You're going to have as much fun as
your kid, by the way, if not more.

1546
01:34:52,750 --> 01:34:55,750
But the cluster, you're going
to have something in common
with your kid. Oh yeah.

1547
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,700
In your, and tell you what, if you don't,

1548
01:34:58,701 --> 01:35:03,640
your kids going to be beating you
is going to be beating you up. Yuck.

1549
01:35:04,730 --> 01:35:09,690
Hey, the kids grow up. My
kids 15 my boy is 15 you know,

1550
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:14,630
you better watch out. And we want,
I think there's a secret part of us,

1551
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:19,631
if not overt part of us that wants
our kid one day to like question you,

1552
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:22,970
stand up to you,
maybe confront you about some stuff,

1553
01:35:22,971 --> 01:35:26,240
some questions they have about you
and your whole thing is, you know,

1554
01:35:26,241 --> 01:35:27,950
I got to ask that the other
day. It's like, no it didn't.

1555
01:35:27,951 --> 01:35:31,700
It didn't really make you mad cause the
story and dichotomy leadership about the

1556
01:35:31,701 --> 01:35:34,370
patches, right to
patches, patches on Julio.

1557
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:39,320
I told the guys no patches and Lafe and
Seth made patches anyways and brought

1558
01:35:39,321 --> 01:35:43,520
them in disguise like once
you like offended and weren't
you mad? And I was like,

1559
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,740
no. Actually I was kind of
thinking to myself, wow, cool.

1560
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:49,670
These guys have that little rebellious
streak that they need as leaders to tell

1561
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:54,320
the man to stick to the man.
Yeah, that's fine with me.

1562
01:35:54,510 --> 01:35:56,660
Yeah. Yeah. It wasn't offensive.

1563
01:35:56,661 --> 01:35:59,270
They weren't doing some of those going
to get someone hurt or killed. They were,

1564
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:02,300
they were just being little rebels.
You're just fine.

1565
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:06,140
So do I want to see that with my
kids? Yes. I want to see a little bit.

1566
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:10,080
Sometimes I needed to keep
that in food chair big time.

1567
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:15,470
So if you're not doing, doing Jujitsu and
your kids are, especially if it's a boy,

1568
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,940
well no girl, boy, whatever.

1569
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:20,900
That the probability of them standing up
to you maybe a little earlier than you

1570
01:36:20,970 --> 01:36:24,260
expected is very high. That's what
I think. That's my hypothesis.

1571
01:36:24,670 --> 01:36:26,930
That's a good thing.
Not a bad thing. Yeah.

1572
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:30,020
It will be a bad thing if you can't
do anything about it cause you're not

1573
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,670
portraying kids.

1574
01:36:31,671 --> 01:36:35,500
Get good kids get good fast yet it's we,

1575
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:38,270
it's funny because you get these
kids right who really get into it.

1576
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:41,900
Then they grow up into adults. Sold
the belt system is kind of, it's like,

1577
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:45,500
it's like planting a seed before the the,
the plant goes above ground.

1578
01:36:45,501 --> 01:36:48,800
There's a lot that goes on underground,
right? So some, you know, some plants,

1579
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:52,880
you know the bamboo anyway,
there's a, what do you call
her? What do you call this?

1580
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:56,630
Limericks I don't know.
Either way. There's an old
school story about the bamboo.

1581
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:00,320
It takes like a bunch of
years when you plant it.

1582
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:04,310
But once it breaks ground, it takes,
it shoots some super fast. Right?

1583
01:37:04,311 --> 01:37:07,560
That's all kids are what you,
so it's a put him in math and metaphors,

1584
01:37:08,090 --> 01:37:11,750
but that's an old common story
they say as a metaphor anyway.

1585
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:16,070
So you put the kid in Jujitsu,
they really like it. And kids,

1586
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:18,200
they get the belt though.
What are their belt? White.

1587
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:23,030
And then you have these intermediary.
Yeah, the main ones are yellow,

1588
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:24,410
white, yellow, orange. Green.

1589
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,600
Gray has become a main one now
two grades become legit. Okay.

1590
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:30,020
So you get up to green belt,

1591
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:34,220
that's essentially the purple slash
brown belt of kids, the greenbelt.

1592
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:38,660
Interesting. And then you can't get a blue
belt until 16 traditionally tradition.

1593
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:42,890
So once you reach blue belt, you're
essentially a black belt for your body.

1594
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:47,090
That's it. Your buddies like
right into puberty or whatever.

1595
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:50,450
Here's the thing with, I don't completely
agree with you. Oh yeah. So yeah,

1596
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:54,410
I dig it. I hear what you're
saying. But to your point,

1597
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:59,220
usually 10 years to become a black belt
around if you're training hard and all

1598
01:37:59,221 --> 01:38:00,054
that.

1599
01:38:00,900 --> 01:38:04,500
And what you're saying as a kid could
start at five and now 16 gets his blue

1600
01:38:04,501 --> 01:38:07,500
belt. He's been trained in for
11 years. So to your point,

1601
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:11,610
his skill level could be very, very high.
Yeah. So that's, yeah, you're right.

1602
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:16,110
And I got into the story. So I said black
belt, maybe irresponsible. Either way.

1603
01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:19,110
When he hits blue belt, that's
not a normal adult blue. Oh No.

1604
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:23,220
That is a kick ass blue belt to kill her.
So he's going to go, oh yeah, for, yeah,

1605
01:38:23,221 --> 01:38:24,510
my first time fighting his blue belt.

1606
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:27,540
I'm 17 years old and he's beating
everyone super easy too, by the way.

1607
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,560
And these are adults 25 26 years
old and he's just beating him.

1608
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:33,390
So he gets his purple
belt right right away.

1609
01:38:33,391 --> 01:38:36,880
Unless he's in one of these situations
where they actually make you be blue bell

1610
01:38:36,881 --> 01:38:38,130
for two years.
He'll sometimes,

1611
01:38:38,131 --> 01:38:41,880
there's that like I think I'd be GGF
does that sometimes competing with anyway

1612
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,270
anyway, when they, when they
reached ground, meaning adulthood,

1613
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,280
when they reach above
ground like the bamboo,

1614
01:38:47,310 --> 01:38:51,370
they just shoot because all their
fundamentals are like, well they have,

1615
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,600
they've developed like a
whole proprioception and
body understanding and it's

1616
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:02,280
proprioception not just of their own body,
but if their opponent's body as well,

1617
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:06,810
like they know where you're their opponent
is going to be. Yeah. Which is legit.

1618
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,330
Big Tent on the path
of Jujitsu and Jujitsu,

1619
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:13,100
the overall concept that we're
getting better. Yeah. Yeah.

1620
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:16,490
It's very jujitsu heavy I think today,
but you know,

1621
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:20,790
I haven't really been training that much
either way. Oh yeah. I'm on the path.

1622
01:39:20,791 --> 01:39:24,570
You're going to need a geek and a rash
guard. So people ask, where do we start?

1623
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:27,500
What do I go?
Where do we go to get it?

1624
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:32,160
[inaudible] go origin main.com boom.
He's, Oh, planty pick would it?

1625
01:39:32,170 --> 01:39:35,040
Whichever one is right for you.
They are all made in America by the way,

1626
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:38,930
which you know, it seems like
common knowledge, but let's this,

1627
01:39:38,970 --> 01:39:43,110
this is your first introduction to
origin main.com boom. Now you know,

1628
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:47,910
get a Gig, get a rash guard, jump on
the path to just to just jump in. Yeah.

1629
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:51,580
Usually the first class is free
by the way. Most places. Yeah.

1630
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,980
And a lot of people ask, Hey, I
need vice going to my first class.

1631
01:39:55,981 --> 01:40:00,900
Just go keep an open mind, have
fun, relax, do all those things.

1632
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:02,090
Yeah.

1633
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:06,930
A big one is like keep
your ears like open.

1634
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:09,000
You know, don't, don't be that
guy like you always say this,

1635
01:40:09,001 --> 01:40:11,670
where don't be the guy. I'd be like,
what if I just do this kind of thing?

1636
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,690
It doesn't work if you just go and
just listen, just listen in in time.

1637
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:17,730
Hard to annoy.

1638
01:40:17,970 --> 01:40:21,750
I think that might be starting to
annoy me a little bit when people,

1639
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:25,110
and I'm talking to a big group of people
that have never done jujitsu before and

1640
01:40:25,111 --> 01:40:27,690
someone throws out the
like, wait, what if,

1641
01:40:27,691 --> 01:40:29,460
you know what if they just grab your
arm right here? It's like, well,

1642
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:31,560
there's 14 other moves
that you can do from that,

1643
01:40:31,590 --> 01:40:33,810
which I didn't get to because I'm trying
to teach you this fundamental thing

1644
01:40:33,811 --> 01:40:38,811
over here that you don't understand it
because you're an idiot and so yeah,

1645
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:43,050
and that's the, yeah, I would say that.
Just keep that in mind. That's the advice.

1646
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:46,200
If you, you know, what do I do
and keep your ears open, keep,

1647
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:50,970
I don't want to discourage people
from asking questions, but let's just,

1648
01:40:51,390 --> 01:40:54,090
let's just think about how,
ask the questions,

1649
01:40:54,130 --> 01:40:54,670
right?
Yeah.

1650
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:59,670
Don't ask it as a challenge to
the Canon of Jujitsu knowledge.

1651
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:04,120
We're just the way some people ask it,
all you have to do is this. It's like, no,

1652
01:41:04,121 --> 01:41:05,890
actually, if you say like, hey,

1653
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:08,170
sometimes he's doing this and
I don't know what to do yet.

1654
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,570
That's why I'm going to tell you,
and I won't be annoyed at all,

1655
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:15,250
have you tell me if you say it to me
like you just uncovered the secret key of

1656
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:19,120
Jujitsu. I'm going to be slightly
annoyed. You won't know it,

1657
01:41:19,150 --> 01:41:21,970
but I'll just be like, oh yeah, well
here you go. Here's what you do.

1658
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:27,310
So actually you mentioned the key to
defeating Jujitsu. You mentioned it.

1659
01:41:27,370 --> 01:41:32,350
What is times runaway you? Oh yeah, 100%
nobody can submit me if I'm running,

1660
01:41:32,351 --> 01:41:36,940
unless the house is true. Running is a
good self defense. He also had origin.

1661
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:39,490
We got, we've got some
supplements at origin. Yes.

1662
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:42,670
And we got joint warfare,

1663
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:48,760
which will help you train every day.

1664
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:52,420
We got
Krill oil,

1665
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:56,890
which will also help you train every day
and those kind of compliment each other.

1666
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:58,390
Then you have very much,

1667
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:03,420
they very much to accomplish what I
didn't eat the whole mental like curcumin

1668
01:42:05,980 --> 01:42:10,560
and Krill oil, this big like massage
for your brain and getting everyone.

1669
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:12,100
So anyways,
so try those.

1670
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:16,690
Those we get great feedback on those
all the time. Also got the discipline,

1671
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:21,780
which is for pre mission nutrition when
you need to do something both cognitive

1672
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:26,440
and physical.
We got your back on this one.

1673
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:32,400
A three scoops we've determined is
kind of the limit in my opinion.

1674
01:42:33,460 --> 01:42:35,450
I think it's kind of limited currently.
I would say that.

1675
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:40,840
Have you ever taken like the old school
preworkout before Jujitsu? Oh No, no,

1676
01:42:40,850 --> 01:42:44,980
no. Don't take this stuff before. I've
done that before and it's horrible.

1677
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:48,740
It's like the wrong wrong move.
I think if you, it cause your,

1678
01:42:48,741 --> 01:42:51,760
your heart's beating, you're all
amped up. It's just not good.

1679
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:55,900
You can't think straight. You know,
discipline is not like that at all.

1680
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:00,130
Three scoops. We'll get you right in
the zone where you want to be and,

1681
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:04,210
but I think I haven't tried four scoops
cause I just think it would be crazy.

1682
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:09,930
But I think four scoops would start to
lean towards too much either watch and

1683
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:13,960
that that's the case with most things,
right? Where it's like, oh yeah,

1684
01:43:13,961 --> 01:43:17,080
two scoops is better than one. And it's
true. Three scoops even better than too.

1685
01:43:17,081 --> 01:43:19,240
Dang, that's true too. And
then that's the kind of

1686
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:25,990
dichotomy you to find the balance.
The balance milk,

1687
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:27,273
we got milk,

1688
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:31,750
milk is milk protein,

1689
01:43:31,751 --> 01:43:36,751
whole milk because milk has protein in
it and we have multiple flavors now we

1690
01:43:37,001 --> 01:43:39,700
have mint chocolate, we have
peanut butter, chocolate,
we have vanilla gorilla,

1691
01:43:39,701 --> 01:43:42,430
we have the darkness,
just straight chocolate.

1692
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:44,860
Which is surprisingly good by the way.
Why is that?

1693
01:43:45,340 --> 01:43:49,510
Are you surprised still right now?
Well, I am not surprised at all anymore.

1694
01:43:49,540 --> 01:43:50,231
We'll put it this way.

1695
01:43:50,231 --> 01:43:53,990
I'm not surprised in the capability
that it took to make it taste good.

1696
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:57,770
I'm not saying that that was the hardest
one to make. It took us a long time.

1697
01:43:57,771 --> 01:44:00,650
We went through iteration. I so, so if it
surprise you, I guess I take that back.

1698
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:05,320
Yeah, it is surprising how good
it is cause it's good. Yeah,

1699
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:08,240
it's really good cause it's easy when
you think about it. You're like, okay,

1700
01:44:08,241 --> 01:44:12,410
chocolate mint. Okay good. I mean
as far as making that tastes good,

1701
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:15,290
I'm not going to be that impressed
because come on, it's mint chocolate.

1702
01:44:15,370 --> 01:44:18,890
Let's face it. That's good. Good mint
or chocolate peanut butter. Same deal.

1703
01:44:19,370 --> 01:44:22,940
In fact, isn't it weird though,
as as good as those flavors are,

1704
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:26,810
how come it's so how come it's been until
now that some going actually make them

1705
01:44:26,811 --> 01:44:28,010
taste the way they're supposed to taste?

1706
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:30,500
It should be more impressed
than you are. Yeah. You know,

1707
01:44:30,501 --> 01:44:33,110
now that you break it down like that.
Sure. I think you're actually right.

1708
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:36,830
I didn't think of that. I just
considered sure. So obvious,

1709
01:44:36,831 --> 01:44:38,690
but peanut butter in
anything in my opinion.

1710
01:44:38,780 --> 01:44:40,070
But it's going to make it taste good.

1711
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:45,100
But if you're going to try to hit me with
a straight chocolate on something with

1712
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:49,010
protein that's good for you, that
low in sugar? I'm like, yeah. Okay.

1713
01:44:49,070 --> 01:44:53,840
I'll give it a chance to in
one gram. Yeah. Uh, I was,

1714
01:44:53,930 --> 01:44:57,770
we went to, I went to
eat with my fam. Sure.

1715
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:02,240
Telia and we were talking about,
we were just talking about food

1716
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:05,450
and my daughter was like,
well sometimes she's like,

1717
01:45:05,650 --> 01:45:08,160
you just eat like one meal and then
you just have like nuts and bolts.

1718
01:45:10,380 --> 01:45:14,030
Cause cause I do, I eat
nuts. I get the big giant,

1719
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:15,960
uh,
what do they call it?

1720
01:45:15,961 --> 01:45:20,540
The cans of mixed nuts that makes up
the container and I have some yeah.

1721
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:24,440
Container to container. Yeah. And I
have just have like a handful of nuts.

1722
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,180
I'm going to put some of them in a ball
and then I'm just doing that and milk.

1723
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:31,860
And that's when you can't use the peanut
butter milk in my opinion. Too much.

1724
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:36,860
Too much nuts get, I did
get, um, I, I don't agree,

1725
01:45:36,861 --> 01:45:39,800
but hey, I dig it man. Oh, you don't agree
that you can get too much peanut butter?

1726
01:45:40,190 --> 01:45:44,150
No. So, okay. Hey, one of the, you know,

1727
01:45:44,151 --> 01:45:46,220
those huge things of peanut butter,
the biggest one.

1728
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:48,950
You buy it from the big box store

1729
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:55,070
files. Yeah. MOCA is
good protein on Nolan.

1730
01:45:55,490 --> 01:45:56,330
And I'll tell you what,

1731
01:45:56,360 --> 01:46:01,360
now we just came out with warrior
kid milk and get the right thing and,

1732
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:08,530
and truly this is awesome and I'll tell
you why it's awesome because kids need

1733
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:12,110
good food.

1734
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:17,380
Kids need healthy food and they're not
going to eat healthy food if it tastes

1735
01:46:17,961 --> 01:46:21,530
like junk.
And so we made warrior kid milk.

1736
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:23,700
There's a little less protein
in it. There's only, uh,

1737
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:28,460
only 11 groups because there's 11
grams of protein for, for the kids.

1738
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:33,650
There's probiotics, there's vitamins,
there's one gram of sugar, which is,

1739
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:37,670
which is not even sugar.
It's something else.

1740
01:46:37,910 --> 01:46:40,800
Whatever is one gram of sugar in there.
Um,

1741
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:45,410
and it tastes awesome.
Strawberry and chocolate.

1742
01:46:45,650 --> 01:46:49,980
The chocolate's delicious.
The strawberry is kind of next level.

1743
01:46:50,770 --> 01:46:52,470
The strawberry is so good.

1744
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:57,770
It tastes like someone took the ultra
high end ice cream and made you a

1745
01:46:59,131 --> 01:47:02,100
milkshake with it. Strawberry
style. That's what it tastes like.

1746
01:47:02,310 --> 01:47:05,250
Your kids are going to love it and you're
going to love it. That's the problem.

1747
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:06,990
I mean the problem is
that's not a problem.

1748
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,730
The reality is I've had
strawberry milk warrior kits,

1749
01:47:10,731 --> 01:47:14,010
strawberry milk like for desert
three meals in a row right now.

1750
01:47:14,040 --> 01:47:17,730
The last three meals I had strawberry
milk every time. Why is that?

1751
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:22,350
Tastes good and it's good. It's
awesome for you. This is a revolution.

1752
01:47:22,410 --> 01:47:25,620
I am not going to throw this out there
like like just throw this one out there.

1753
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:29,370
There's a revolutionary thing,
but can you imagine,

1754
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:33,030
I think this is the first product in
the history of the world that I can

1755
01:47:33,031 --> 01:47:35,430
personally think of. You tell me if
you can think of something else. Okay.

1756
01:47:35,730 --> 01:47:40,380
This is the first product that I can
think of in the world that the kids are

1757
01:47:40,381 --> 01:47:43,740
going to want to have it as much as the
parents are going to want them to have

1758
01:47:43,741 --> 01:47:46,590
it.
I don't know of any other thing like that.

1759
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:52,110
What other thing is like that big kids
want to have it as bad as the parents

1760
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:55,110
because the kids want ice cream.
They want it bad. The kid,

1761
01:47:55,140 --> 01:47:59,970
the parents don't want to have it. Right.
The parents want the kids to have, uh,

1762
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:03,120
the vitamin pill.
The kids don't want to have it.

1763
01:48:03,540 --> 01:48:08,010
This is a universal want.
Yeah. It's delicious

1764
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:10,800
and it's awesome for the kids.

1765
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:15,690
So I'm super stoked because it's cool
when kids want to be on the warrior kid

1766
01:48:15,691 --> 01:48:19,710
path, but they don't have
good food. Easily accessible.

1767
01:48:20,010 --> 01:48:22,190
This is going to replace
all them little Chocolatey,

1768
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:25,940
sugary drinks that parents
had been forced to do.

1769
01:48:25,950 --> 01:48:29,850
Feed their young children and poisoned
them no more. Those days are over.

1770
01:48:30,990 --> 01:48:32,670
So get on the milk train.
Yeah.

1771
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,640
We'll kinda get your warrior kids on
the block train as well. Yeah. The,

1772
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:38,500
that strawberry one.
It's funny because I don't,

1773
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:43,440
when I go to wherever to get a milkshake,
I don't get this job here. No, no, no, no.

1774
01:48:43,441 --> 01:48:47,400
Neither would I. But I mixed up
the street, you know, I got some,

1775
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:52,370
everyone's excited. There's
been some hype and uh, you know,

1776
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:55,860
so I'm like, all right, we'll see what
up. Me and my son, whatever. He's too,

1777
01:48:55,861 --> 01:48:59,240
by the way. Uh, so yeah, it makes
it up or whatever. And you know,

1778
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:02,370
I taste it and probably date, you know
how something will bring you right back.

1779
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:06,200
Oh, you're a kid, the
strawberry, whatever. That's,

1780
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:10,420
I think that's the last time I really
got into a strawberry stuff back then.

1781
01:49:10,740 --> 01:49:11,573
Right back.

1782
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:15,030
And then there's the readymade strawberry
milk that used to get when you were a

1783
01:49:15,031 --> 01:49:15,660
kid.

1784
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:20,400
And let's face it that that is a whole
memory section in your brain that

1785
01:49:20,401 --> 01:49:23,520
remembers that it's looking for it.
Sometimes you go into a seven 11,

1786
01:49:23,521 --> 01:49:24,470
you see one of those,
you're like nick.

1787
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:30,780
And now that I am straight up milk, same
the strawberry milk right there. Yeah.

1788
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:34,350
It's probably tastes better
because it's got a little bit,

1789
01:49:34,351 --> 01:49:38,720
it's a little bit thicker, you know, it's
got a little bit more a milkshake. Yeah.

1790
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:42,630
We're going to have to come
up with strawberry of Mocha
adult too with a little

1791
01:49:42,631 --> 01:49:46,350
bit more protein just for GP because
the GP is good. But in the meantime,

1792
01:49:46,410 --> 01:49:48,730
get that warrior kits strawberry
bringing you rent and the warrior kit

1793
01:49:48,770 --> 01:49:52,660
chocolate's good too. It's, it's
awesome. Well, I prefer the chocolate.

1794
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:56,350
I'm just saying the strawberry brought
you back saying it was good. I like it.

1795
01:49:56,380 --> 01:50:01,030
Obviously my son, my son drink most of
it, but you know he's too, he's too.

Yes sir. How's his, what? What's his
bicep workouts looking like or a solid?

1797
01:50:04,810 --> 01:50:07,590
He actually has a video of him dead
lifting one of the kettle bells.

1798
01:50:07,591 --> 01:50:09,580
The audit was dope.
Yeah,

1799
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:14,110
too good form to kids have surprisingly
natural. Good form. Yeah. What's up?

1800
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:18,310
They get broken down over time by society.
Got To fight against it. All right,

1801
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:21,790
let's roll. No, no. Like what

specific direct messages on the ref.

path. Go to Jocko, store.com also,

1813
01:51:03,291 --> 01:51:07,210
kind of letting them know cause there's
a few of them. I'll do that check.

1814
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:10,420
Do that also got, uh, hats. Yeah.

And hoodies, legit hoodies, legit,

1818
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,050
heavy, heavy. And do we,

1819
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:32,470
do we have any Hawaiian on their left?
No. Hawaiian or uh, you know, hey.

1820
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,760
Yeah, no, not as of right now. No. Okay.

1821
01:51:36,410 --> 01:51:39,840
But maybe in the summer we'll make
the Hawaiian one again or maybe the,

1822
01:51:39,970 --> 01:51:43,660
the winner for the actual light people.
Oh yeah, true. Got To get it home.

1823
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:48,560
So that's good. Yeah. Some women's stuff
on there too, by the way. Some new, uh,

1824
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:52,520
it's more a women's stuff
for the female troopers. Yes.

1825
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:57,640
Specifically in the house. Uh,
remember subscribed to this podcast,

1826
01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:01,360
iTunes, Google play, stitcher,
leave review. So I can read them.

1827
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:04,250
So echo can read them,
but mostly so I can read them.

1828
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:09,230
I want the feedback that
goes over there. Cruz. Well,

1829
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:12,400
I get addicted to reading
those when they're funny.

1830
01:52:12,401 --> 01:52:14,080
They're when they're interesting,

1831
01:52:14,081 --> 01:52:18,120
but usually the interesting ones by
interesting, I mean funny. Yeah. Good.

1832
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:21,490
Very good. Uh, and also don't forget
about the warrior kid podcast.

1833
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:27,000
Nothing but great feedback
on the warrior kid podcast.

1834
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:29,230
People listening to it over
and over and over again.

1835
01:52:29,620 --> 01:52:31,000
Partially because they love it.

1836
01:52:31,001 --> 01:52:33,670
Partially because I haven't
put out enough episodes.

1837
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:38,860
So we got a little intense time period.
Books coming out and all that.

1838
01:52:38,861 --> 01:52:40,660
But we're kind of getting through that.

1839
01:52:40,930 --> 01:52:45,680
So I'll be able to get back on the
path of making the warrior podcast.

1840
01:52:45,681 --> 01:52:48,770
Matter of fact, I'm almost done
with a story from Uncle Jake.

1841
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,050
Good story from Uncle Jake. A
real big lesson learned. Oh,

1842
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:56,600
that'll be on the warrior kid podcasts.
So subscribe to that one as well.

1843
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:57,261
And don't forget about that.

1844
01:52:57,261 --> 01:53:02,261
Warrior kids soap from
Irish oaks ranch.com we've
got young aid and a warrior

1845
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:06,920
kid running his own business.
Age 13 making money,

1846
01:53:07,010 --> 01:53:10,760
making product made in America,
made with goat milk.

1847
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:16,640
What else do you need to know other
than get some soap and stay clean.

1848
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:22,610
Also get the youtube youtube videos.
Now we are stepping up our game.

1849
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,140
I know we've been talking
about this for a long time.

1850
01:53:24,141 --> 01:53:26,940
Some of it's just been in the form
of harassment, harassing echo,

1851
01:53:27,350 --> 01:53:31,100
but we actually are making preparations.

1852
01:53:31,190 --> 01:53:35,030
Training is underway.
People are coming on board,

1853
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:38,060
things are happening.
We're moving in the right direction.

1854
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:42,950
And so youtube, subscribe to
Youtube. We're going to start.

1855
01:53:43,750 --> 01:53:46,250
We're going to use that
platform even more.

1856
01:53:46,670 --> 01:53:49,070
Yeah, get it out there. Yes.

1857
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:54,170
Utilizing spreading good messages
to keep people on the path.

1858
01:53:54,230 --> 01:53:56,060
Sometimes to get people on the patterns.

1859
01:53:57,120 --> 01:54:00,240
Psychological warfare. Speaking of the
path, a little help staying on the path.

1860
01:54:00,540 --> 01:54:05,540
These are little tracks about overcoming
your own personal individual weaknesses

1861
01:54:05,641 --> 01:54:07,500
at one time or another.
Yes.

1862
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:11,880
So you get that album and you
press play in certain scenarios.

1863
01:54:12,150 --> 01:54:16,260
We're working on assembling
psychological warfare to,

1864
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,970
yeah, probably going to be
called. All your excuses are lies

1865
01:54:22,590 --> 01:54:25,200
and that one will come
out before Christmas.

1866
01:54:25,230 --> 01:54:27,420
We'll get it to you before
Christmas. Yeah. Yeah.

1867
01:54:27,421 --> 01:54:29,010
We should be able to get
it to you before Christmas.

1868
01:54:29,910 --> 01:54:32,430
Yeah.
In time for the New Year's resolutions,

1869
01:54:32,450 --> 01:54:35,100
the as they develop as they develop,

1870
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:38,830
she didn't know your anti
new year's resolution. I am.
From what I understand. No,

1871
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:42,720
that's a just another day to
me. No, don't worry on my part.

1872
01:54:43,890 --> 01:54:46,980
If I was going to make a resolution,
you know, and I'd start it right now.

1873
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,380
Why would I wait? No,
now, not even today, now,

1874
01:54:52,170 --> 01:54:56,730
not later today that after dinner.
No, get it done now. All right,

1875
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:00,930
well it can still technically be a year's
resolution because you could just be

1876
01:55:00,931 --> 01:55:04,610
like boom, like from now on
for the next year again, eh,

1877
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:08,910
that doesn't really fit either way. I dig
what you're saying and cool men do it.

1878
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:14,330
Speaking of staying on the path on
it.com/jocko actually there it is on it to

1879
01:55:14,641 --> 01:55:17,550
stay on it on it. And when he,
when they named it on the path,

1880
01:55:17,551 --> 01:55:21,810
that's what they had it in reference to.
I know that 100% for a fact

1881
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:28,200
get your fitness stuff.
That's how you stay on the path.

1882
01:55:28,201 --> 01:55:31,080
You bring the gym to your house. You
said this, you said this earlier,

1883
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:34,530
I still have a 24 hour fitness
membership by the way. Yeah.

1884
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:37,200
And I go to 24 hour fitness
every once in a while. But,

1885
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:42,570
but having this stuff at home, we'll
keep you on the path like hardcore. Yeah.

1886
01:55:42,690 --> 01:55:46,060
So get your kettle bells when you do
kettle bells. When you do kettlebells,

1887
01:55:46,430 --> 01:55:48,390
kettlebells,
I do kettlebells.

1888
01:55:48,780 --> 01:55:51,350
Everyone that I know that's
on the path does kettlebells.

1889
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,730
I'm not saying if you don't do
kettle bells, you're not on the path.

1890
01:55:53,731 --> 01:55:54,480
I'm not saying that.

1891
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:59,310
I'm saying if you're on the path
and you don't do kettle bells,

1892
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:02,250
consider getting
kettlebells for your house.

1893
01:56:02,850 --> 01:56:07,200
And when you do go to on it.com to get
them cause there's cooler in my opinion,

1894
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:10,140
that's the only ones I got go there.
There's a lot of cool stuff on there.

1895
01:56:10,141 --> 01:56:11,100
Some clothes on there too.

1896
01:56:11,220 --> 01:56:16,220
If you want a lot of information
as well on it.com/and Jocko.

1897
01:56:16,231 --> 01:56:20,070
By the way, it's a good
spot. Also Jocko white tea.

1898
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:22,890
Speaking of bringing
the gym to your house,

1899
01:56:23,550 --> 01:56:27,450
you better bring 8,000 pounds anyway
if you drinking Jocko white tea. Yes,

1900
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:30,370
it is proven. People ask me is
that for real? 8,000 pounds a year.

1901
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:33,990
A hundred percent a hundred
percent one ton is 2000 pounds.

1902
01:56:34,710 --> 01:56:38,040
Tonight you will be able to dead lift
and you only have to drink one too,

1903
01:56:38,041 --> 01:56:39,000
by the way.
I drink the camp.

1904
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:42,920
Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes people say,
well I could only dead lift, you know,

1905
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:48,260
four 85 and I'm like Drake, Morty. I
remember I used to be like that too.

1906
01:56:48,261 --> 01:56:52,190
I dig it. But yeah. Hey it even got
Jordan B. Peterson. Yeah. Office.

1907
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:54,110
He was plateaued at 7,000 pounds.

1908
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:56,900
God knows how long he was stuck
there that week level. I know.

1909
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,030
Then he got right up to 8,000 pounds

1910
01:57:01,260 --> 01:57:04,440
t you know what the fuck?
What's funny about not what's funny?

1911
01:57:04,441 --> 01:57:06,300
What's interesting first episode

1912
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:08,920
of this podcast.
Oh Yeah,

1913
01:57:09,010 --> 01:57:13,930
we talk about pomegranate Chai.
Yeah. You say pomegranate, Jada.

1914
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:17,350
No, whatever tea that you're into,
cars, because that was the first one.

1915
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,520
You made this weird kind of
easing into this podcast starting,

1916
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:25,750
which wasn't really what I had in mind.
You know, I had more mine like, Hey, okay,

1917
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:29,830
we press record, we start, you had a,
you know, we're cruising over here.

1918
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:32,920
We'll just kind of be, well, yeah,
well the part cost has begun now,

1919
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:35,560
but as a result of different mindset,

1920
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:36,490
as a result,

1921
01:57:36,491 --> 01:57:41,230
there's that added layer for the people
that did listen to that first few

1922
01:57:41,231 --> 01:57:45,730
seconds of that first first episode.
You say palm or we say pomegranate Chai,

1923
01:57:45,731 --> 01:57:47,650
you see no pomegranate white tea.

1924
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:52,110
Yeah. And then look at,
you look at, you now,

1925
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:54,870
Meet Your own pomegranate white tea.

1926
01:57:55,080 --> 01:57:58,740
People would ask me all the time what
kind of tea and I wouldn't really be able

1927
01:57:58,741 --> 01:58:01,830
to tell him because I try. I would try
different ones. No one was perfect,

1928
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:05,930
so I just went and made the perfect one.
I mean drill. Yeah. That's how you did.

1929
01:58:06,110 --> 01:58:09,840
We have it on our website too, by the
way. Jocko. store.com we offer it there,

1930
01:58:09,841 --> 01:58:14,280
but you can get it anywhere. Yeah.
Yeah. Amazon too. Amazon has this stuff.

1931
01:58:14,281 --> 01:58:17,070
Amazon prime for the cans.
Save yourself a little shipping.

1932
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:21,660
You're on Amazon Prime TV. Then you've
got that also on Amazon and everywhere.

1933
01:58:21,661 --> 01:58:23,730
You can buy books. We got
some, we got some books.

1934
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:27,660
I got way the warrior
kid and Mark's mission.

1935
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:30,540
Those are part of a series and those will,

1936
01:58:31,020 --> 01:58:36,020
those are good books for
your children as a parent.

1937
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:39,900
They want how many? I don't know
how many people have told me this.

1938
01:58:39,901 --> 01:58:42,100
These books have made parenting easier for

1939
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:44,260
them because now they just
look at the kid and say, Hey,

1940
01:58:44,261 --> 01:58:47,950
what did you think this is a water warrior
kid would do you think a warrior kid

1941
01:58:47,951 --> 01:58:50,680
would eat that donut? Right
now? I don't think so.

1942
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:52,850
Do you think that warrior
kid would leave with wood?

1943
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:56,590
Would leave the room all dirty?
I don't think so. I think
it's like, no, no, no way.

1944
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:58,290
I got parents and say their kids,

1945
01:58:58,291 --> 01:59:00,570
they don't know where your
kid wouldn't do that. Yeah.

1946
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,800
Like when they read warrior kid,
their voice goes from like, Hey dad,

1947
01:59:03,801 --> 01:59:05,140
what do you think we're
going to do to like, Hey dad,

1948
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:10,630
I don't think we should do that. Sounds
like weakness to me. Case in point today.

1949
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:15,130
So my daughter, she's sensitive. I
wouldn't say thins getting a lot.

1950
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:16,870
I don't know if it's thin skin sensitive,
whatever.

1951
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:20,470
So like if you say something mean to her
as like if another kid says something

1952
01:59:20,471 --> 01:59:23,200
mean, that's something to
her. Super Nice to everybody.

1953
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:27,550
So a kid called her a liar.
Oh,

1954
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:31,570
but apparently that's this kid's thing.
He just calls people liar.

1955
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:33,580
Like you've got to good
reaction out of it. Some point,

1956
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:36,850
some dude ain't know he got
one each it to some point.

1957
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:39,700
At some point somebody's acting all
crazy and he's like, okay, not now.

1958
01:59:39,701 --> 01:59:42,370
I know how to make people really not
know how to get a reaction. Yeah.

1959
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:46,720
So she doesn't like that, you know?
Cause she lying was kind of the thing.

1960
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:50,620
My Dad always kind of, we
would get spankings for
lying. That's pretty much it.

1961
01:59:50,650 --> 01:59:55,420
That's a big violation of the whole
thing sold, you know? So as a result,

1962
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:58,390
not to say I spanked her for lying.
I'm not saying that,

1963
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,140
but she doesn't like the
whole line or she gets a cute,

1964
02:00:02,141 --> 02:00:04,360
you know how like she'll do
something, I'll be like, hey,
did you brush your teeth?

1965
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:08,140
She'll be like, yes, I don't be like,
and then you go smooth. She'd be like,

1966
02:00:08,141 --> 02:00:10,360
oh my gosh. She'll get devastated
if I think she's lying.

1967
02:00:10,980 --> 02:00:15,610
She's a good check for Rod
toothbrushes. Wet or dry? No. See I get,

1968
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:20,260
I go deep. I just lie to me.
We're going to see what he did.

1969
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:21,670
But see what you do though.

1970
02:00:21,671 --> 02:00:25,420
Like if I go and investigate
that indicates to her
she's fine. Lack of trust.

1971
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:28,700
Yeah. Like, you think I'm lying and
she gets really sad. So anyway, well,

1972
02:00:28,710 --> 02:00:31,140
what I'm saying is she's sensitive to
that kind of stuff, just manipulating you.

1973
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:36,850
That's a very possible to
do. Or if they're good, you
know, kind of watch them.

1974
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:41,350
Yes you do. Anyway, so at school she
was like, Hey, that's the boy. He call,

1975
02:00:41,351 --> 02:00:45,430
he calls me liar. And another day
he called her a liar every day.

1976
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:50,170
Like that's his name, like you're a
liar every day. So one of my things,

1977
02:00:50,171 --> 02:00:52,750
I have to go too deep into it. I
tell her, hey, you're a nice person.

1978
02:00:52,751 --> 02:00:54,880
So you'd be nice to people whether
they're mean to you or not.

1979
02:00:55,120 --> 02:00:56,380
So you're just a nice person.

1980
02:00:56,381 --> 02:00:58,840
You don't like become a mean person
cause they'd be meeting. She goes, well,

1981
02:00:58,841 --> 02:01:01,210
I really don't like to be called a liar.
I was like,

1982
02:01:01,211 --> 02:01:03,520
would you rather be called
a liar or plate face?

1983
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:08,020
And then she started laughing because
she remembers that's how he gets over it.

1984
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:12,340
He laughs at himself, calls himself plate
face. You know, Nathan, he's over there.

1985
02:01:12,341 --> 02:01:15,310
He's all kind of laughing, confused, like
Oh, that's funny. And they laugh about it.

1986
02:01:15,311 --> 02:01:19,180
Then they slowly become friends. So she
was like, boom, weight. Less bothered.

1987
02:01:19,210 --> 02:01:22,210
That was today, and I'm not even joking.
It was today when I dropped her off.

1988
02:01:22,430 --> 02:01:26,350
Awesome. So that's where
awarded kid and Mark's mission.

1989
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:29,170
We also got discipline
equals freedom field manual.

1990
02:01:29,950 --> 02:01:32,860
This is the book that what's great
about this one. People tell me,

1991
02:01:32,920 --> 02:01:36,610
I read two pages every day.
I read three pages every day.

1992
02:01:36,730 --> 02:01:40,220
I wake up in the morning and
read one page. Get yourself

1993
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:43,820
on the path, get your mind right
as my boy Matthews to say. Yep,

1994
02:01:44,300 --> 02:01:47,420
up in Yosemite, dig it. He hit
me up on Twitter. By the way,

1995
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:52,160
I'm going to track him down. And so that's
just one equals freedom field manual.

1996
02:01:52,540 --> 02:01:56,000
Christmas time.
Good gift for someone.

1997
02:01:56,390 --> 02:01:59,210
You want to put someone on the
path? Cool. Give them that book.

1998
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:03,110
Don't even say anything. Don't
even, don't even introduce it.

1999
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:06,650
Just give them that book and just let it,
let it ride.

2000
02:02:07,280 --> 02:02:08,870
Because when you open it up,
you're going to open it.

2001
02:02:08,871 --> 02:02:12,500
You have to open it up because it looks
it's not normal, and when you open it up,

2002
02:02:12,530 --> 02:02:13,790
you see that's not normal either.

2003
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:18,650
It's not just a bunch of like black
print on a white page. No, no.

2004
02:02:18,680 --> 02:02:21,500
It's different. So he started flipping
through it. Then you start saying,

2005
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:25,940
wait a second, this makes sense to
me. I did. The next thing you know,

2006
02:02:25,941 --> 02:02:30,941
you wake up and it's not
seven 42 it's four 48

2007
02:02:33,230 --> 02:02:36,910
seven 42 is still pretty good.
I think it depends on who you are.

2008
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:42,140
That's the discipline equals freedom
field manual. After that wealth,

2009
02:02:42,141 --> 02:02:44,150
not after that, but the first
book, extreme ownership.

2010
02:02:44,420 --> 02:02:49,250
There's a book about combat leadership
and you got the dichotomy of leadership,

2011
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:52,910
which just came out dichotomy.
Leadership, by the way,

2012
02:02:54,380 --> 02:02:54,801
by the way,

2013
02:02:54,801 --> 02:02:59,801

that list is dichotomy leadership.

books and much appreciate that support.

We know what you do every
day and we thank you for it.

2041
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:03,760
And to everyone else,
remember the words of Keith Douglas.

2042
02:05:03,761 --> 02:05:08,761
To trust anyone or admit any hope of
a better world is criminally foolish.

2043
02:05:10,570 --> 02:05:15,130
As foolish as it is to
stop working for it.

2044
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:21,760
Keep working for it.
Do your part every day to become stronger,

2045
02:05:21,820 --> 02:05:23,560
faster,
smarter,

2046
02:05:23,680 --> 02:05:27,640
better to try and make the
world a little bit better.

2047
02:05:27,670 --> 02:05:32,350
Keep working for it and
keep getting after it.

2048
02:05:33,470 --> 02:05:34,930
And until next time,

2049
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:39,100
this is echo and Jocko out.
