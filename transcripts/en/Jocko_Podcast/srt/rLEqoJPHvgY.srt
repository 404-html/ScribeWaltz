1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
I have ongoing regret for never joining
the military or police department and

2
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:10,230
I'm not yet strong enough to consider
changing careers now for financial

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,064
reasons.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,180
I also don't know how to discuss this
with my wife as we want to make some

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,130
additions to the family soon.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,580
I feel unfulfilled in the
single aspect of my life.

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,260
It's a strange feeling considering I have
skyrocketed up the chain in my company

8
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,094
so quickly,

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,900
so many would do anything
to be where I find myself.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,040
How do you overcome your face or how do
you overcome or face yourself knowing

11
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,050
you're holding back
from a certain calling?

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,280
Because I really do see it
as a calling in some form.

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,960
I'm interested to hear from you.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,960
I think this is pretty easy. Go
join the reserves. Hmm. Go join.

15
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:55,710
The reserves would be go in
the army reserves go in there.

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,810
They're like every branch has some
reserves where you're going to do one week

17
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:04,170
and month. You have to do
bootcamp. That'll be whatever.
It's going to be 10 weeks,

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:07,080
12 weeks, 14 weeks, depending
on which branch you go into.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,850
And then you do one weekend a month and
you do two weeks in the summer. You,

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,570
you'll understand what the military is
about. There's actually a chance, well,

21
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,000
first of all, there's chance you'd be
deployed. I mean, when we were in Iraq,

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,570
you know, when we deployed to Ramadi,
my second deployment to Iraq, the,

23
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,300
the unit that was there,
the two to eight iron soldiers,

24
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,950
they were reserve unit
out of Pennsylvania.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,460
They were awesome and they'd been there
for 14 months and they lost a lot of

26
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:33,170
guys and they fought hard.
So it's not like this reserve thing is a,

27
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:36,870
is is a different class,
a soldier,

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,660
they're soldiers for real.
They're marines for real.

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,290
Then you may be going on deployment.
Uh,

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,980
but what's cool about it is most
companies, they will excuse you.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,560
Basically when you go in the reserves,
they'll excuse you when you have time.

32
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:52,590
And in fact, I think it's,
I was never in the reserves,

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,940
but I think you're actually protected by
the federal government from being fired

34
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,620
because you're serving in the reserves.

35
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,100
So I would definitely go and look into
the reserves because otherwise that

36
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,860
feeling that you have, I can only
imagine it's never going to go away.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,753
I don't know.

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:13,710
Because I had that feeling that I wanted
to join the military when I was four

39
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,820
years old and I did it as soon
as I turned 18. So I don't,

40
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,330
you know, I didn't know what I regret
now. It was like I want to still be in,

41
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,920
you know, so especially now with
the fighting picking up overseas,

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,350
it's uh, you know, that's, that's the
only thing that, that I feel is damn,

43
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,420
I want to go back. But if you never did
it at all, that's a grinding feeling.

44
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:39,660
So go talk to a recruiter, getting
the reserves and you know what else?

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,660
In certain areas, there's definitely
volunteer fire departments. Yeah,

46
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,590
you can volunteer as a fireman and
you can volunteer as a policeman.

47
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,690
They have certain, uh, I don't know.

48
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:51,300
I have no idea what state you're
from asking this question.

49
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,270
But there's deputies you can get
deputized, you can go through a,

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,920
in San Diego they definitely have
reserved cops where you have to go to

51
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,890
[inaudible], you have to go to the police
academy and you become a reserve cop.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,180
So, and with all that, um,

53
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,980
you want to talk about it with your
wife, talk about with your wife. Yeah.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,290
You know,
you say you don't know how to,

55
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,440
this isn't a situation where you
can be totally honest with her, hey,

56
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,930
I always want to join the military.
I haven't done it.

57
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,750
I feel like it's something I really
want to do. Here's the options.

58
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:24,700
I want to go look at. What do you
think? Now you're, you're married,

59
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,920
you're married to a girl and
you're going to have kids.

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,090
It's your military service will be
harder on her than it is on you.

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,950
So she better be strong. She
better be tough. And you know, the,

62
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,590
the military wives out
there, I mean, my wife,

63
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:42,940
when I was gone on deployment after
deployment, it's not easy. I mean,

64
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:47,941
luckily she's tough and she raised
kids without me and she took care of

65
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,550
household without me and she went to the
hospital to visit my wounded guys and

66
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:58,450
she went to the funerals of my guys were
getting killed and she had to do that

67
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:00,490
while I was gone on deployment and I was,

68
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,650
she was hearing from me once a week maybe.

69
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,030
So you're going to put your
family through a lot of stress.

70
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,880
Now you might stress your family a lot
by always having regret that they held

71
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,210
you back. That's selfish. But that's true.

72
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,680
So I would just go look into it,
see what the options are,

73
00:04:20,681 --> 00:04:23,920
talk about it with your wife.
There are some really good benefits to it.

74
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,330
And also the final point is sometimes
when you're reservist you can decide that

75
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:31,900
you want to go active duty. Maybe
you love it. Maybe you say, yeah,

76
00:04:31,901 --> 00:04:32,734
this was my calling.

77
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,340
Maybe you're fourth day in boot
camp where you haven't slept.

78
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:40,060
You had your head shaved, you're tired,
you're hungry, the food is horrible.

79
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,970
And you say, man, this is what I've
always wanted to do with my life.

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,590
And if that happens, there's options
where you can now go active duty and,

81
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,930
and you can see how your wife
dealt with it while you were gone.

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,780
And if she dealt with it,
well that's great. Hey,

83
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,840
let's make a career out of this
and that's a good option to do.

84
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,210
So there's some that I think you're
this, this, this, this is easy day, easy,

85
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,820
easy problem to take care of.
No factor.
