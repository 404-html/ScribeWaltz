1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
This is Jocko podcast number
73 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,650
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,240
It has been quite a few
episodes since we did some Q.

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:22,800
And. A. You don't answered some
questions from the interwebs.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,420
We had a series of guests hate a couple
books and just kind of slid a little bit

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,000
on Q. And. A. So Q. And A. Yeah,

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,093
let's rock.

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,840
Let's question number one.
Christian Moore. Yeah.

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,150
Well, Christian, the one Jocko,

10
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:53,330
do you have to make a conscious effort
not to overreact to situations or is it

11
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:55,490
natural slash ingrained now?

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,600
I would say at this point it's,

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:03,530
it's fairly ingrained and
I don't overreact to a lot
of stuff anymore. In fact,

14
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:06,130
sometimes I just don't react
to stuff to be honest with you.

15
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,150
When things are going on, I'll just
be sort of okay, Yup, nod the head,

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,220
you know,
listen to what's happening,

17
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:16,820
listen to the people freaking
out and I don't, yeah,

18
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,760
I don't overreact to
a lot of stuff that's,

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,860
I think it's pretty ingrained right now.

20
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,600
And I would say that in
order to get there, you know,

21
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:30,410
in order to s to try and move in that
direction because that is the best way to

22
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:32,180
be. Again, I'm not saying to be a robot,

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,270
I'm not saying you should have no emotions
and you should know never show any,

24
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,360
and I'm not saying that,
but you shouldn't.

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,400
You should have some
control over those emotions.

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,470
Especially from a leadership perspective.
Right.

27
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,660
That's what I'm talking about here
from a leadership perspective.

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,360
So one of the things that you can
do is when you, when you, when,

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,430
when chaos starts to hit,
you know, picture that,

30
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,920
what does this look like from the outside?
What do I look like from the outside?

31
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:59,900
When somebody says something,
Hugh,

32
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:03,740
that's traumatic or is going to cause a
disturbance or it's gonna cause problems

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,120
immediately think yourself,
okay,

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,100
what am I going to look like
from the outside right now?

35
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:11,240
What am I going to look like to them?
If they're recording this in your head,

36
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,970
like they're recording this and we're
going to go sit down and watch it later.

37
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:16,080
When they first came out
with in the seal teams,

38
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:20,180
when we started started recording people
as they entered rooms and as we did

39
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,520
primarily close quarters combat scenarios.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,520
So you've got guys in tight quarters and
they're making very quick decisions and

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,310
you start seeing what you look like and
it, and it makes you better. You know?

42
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:37,010
That's why that's one of the reasons why
you do it is same thing with Jujitsu.

43
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,860
You've watched the tape or or MMA,

44
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:42,770
you watched the tape of what
someone's doing it. Football,

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,980
they do that in every sport, right? They
watched the tape, see what you look like,

46
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:47,030
see what mistakes you made.

47
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,180
So when someone hits you with something
that's disturbing or it's going to cause

48
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,624
problems,

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,740
picture that you're being recorded and
you're going to have to watch the play by

50
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,980
play later with your

51
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,750
team and look at what,

52
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,980
how much you lost your temper or how
much you got frazzled and what a disaster

53
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:09,160
you were. So I, that's
what I would picture.

54
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,880
Or as you start to move
in the direction of a,

55
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:16,780
I'm not going to get frazzled by problems,

56
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,910
I'm just going to listen.
I'm going to assess,

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,390
I'm going to make decisions
and move forward. Yeah, yeah.

58
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,680
Pretty recent. Yeah. Pretty
simple. Dang. Yeah, that, that
play when they play glyphs,

59
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,440
go to the videotape, you know, let's play
in football or man and meeting. They'd,

60
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,040
you know,
big screen projector.

61
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:39,250
Get Echo the little laser pointer.
Yes, exactly. So when men,

62
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:42,190
when you mess up and everyone's looking,
what are you doing here?

63
00:03:42,191 --> 00:03:46,290
They pause it and it shows you like
mid mess up. You know what man? It's,

64
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,850
it's like they put you on the stage
and just thrilled tomatoes at you.

65
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:54,160
That's what it feels like. That's how
you get better though. Yeah. Agree.

66
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,083
Totally agree.

67
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,210
And in a way I told you I used to do
this where it had to do with more like

68
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,200
getting mad. Like if I find
myself getting mad, you know,

69
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,170
same thing over reaction kind of where
I'd really shame myself kind of like,

70
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,860
man, that's embarrassing.
You got mad kind of thing.

71
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,490
So it would be on my mind the whole
time where anytime I felt myself getting

72
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,820
mad, it'd be on my mind. Like all look
at me, I'm being one of those guys.

73
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,880
So it's kind of the same thing, but it's
in your own head kind of thing. Yeah.

74
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,760
And it's, it really boils
down to something I talk about
all the time. Detachment.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,580
Yeah. That's what I'm talking about.
Being able to picture yourself.

76
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,750
What do I look like right now?

77
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,350
Am I appearing to be a panicked
stricken loser or an a calm,

78
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:41,350
cool, collected leader that's going
to step up and make a good decision,

79
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,460
assessed the situation and move forward.
Let's look like that guy.

80
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,120
Go winter heater. What about if
you're like, what? Uh, what uh,

81
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,760
what about if you're tired?
Like you didn't get it.

82
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:56,890
A lot of sleep for a few days. Serious
right now. No factor Nova. Okay.

83
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,130
It doesn't affect you. You know, people
in what your uncle people get irritable.

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,910
You get tired. Yeah. Which I
actually find a music. Yeah.

85
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,960
But that's a real thing. That is
a real thing. You know, it's like,

86
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,620
you know what that means?
You need to, if you,

87
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:10,680
if you're one of those people
that's going to be in that mode,

88
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,400
you need to be aware of that and you need
to focus even more on not overreacting

89
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,760
and acting like a baby because you're
tired. And that could be, yeah, exactly.

90
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,760
That's a good one. Like a baby, like
a baby. Yeah. What does the baby do?

91
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,630
You start crying. Yes. And that's actually
kind of the point there where, you know,

92
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,700
I used to be one of the,
before I had kids,

93
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,620
you know how when the kid is acting up,

94
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,430
you know your friend's kid is acting up
and then you're like, oh, on a bratty kid.

95
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,640
But the parent of the kid
that always is like, oh,

96
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:39,970
he's just tired or she's just tired. And
you're like, you thought it was a lie.

97
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,920
No. Know your kid is a brat. That's
what you, you kind of think you know,

98
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:49,010
your kid's not tired.
I'll always judging you.

99
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,010
I think most people without you,
that's how,

100
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,230
and after awhile you,
especially when you have kids,

101
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,980
you start to realize,
oh

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,970
m and there's a difference in kids'
behavior and may must be fundamental.

103
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:04,230
Cause this is a one year old
we're talking about, you know,

104
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,710
it's not like he learned to
start crying when he's tired.

105
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,070
It's like when you're tired you just
less patient ease. Even as an adult,

106
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,110
you ever been tired and you're like
waiting for something, whatever. Bro.

107
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,340
When you're,

108
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,670
when you're tired and you're waiting for
something and it's not coming like as

109
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,340
quick as you expected
and what you're used to.

110
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,780
Here's the problem that I run in with
with waiting or being held up or when I,

111
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,210
this is how I realized
I was a control freak.

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,680
A kind of is going to the airport because
if you're running late in the airport,

113
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:36,440
you can't control Tsa.
They're going to take,

114
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,020
and of course if,

115
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,030
if I'm on time for my flight to waiting
in the TSA line for five minutes is not

116
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:48,140
a big deal at all.
If I'm late for my flight,

117
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,580
five minutes is an eternity in their
pathetic and they're losers and they're

118
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,410
slow and it's all on me.

119
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,020
It's all on me cause I went to
the airport late so I'm not,

120
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:59,900
I get to the airport early cause I don't
like to have the feeling of things I

121
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,330
can't control. So I'm going
to do the best to mitigate it.

122
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,250
That's one of those situations if you
get all tired and then you get all angry

123
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:10,340
and you start crying like a baby,
then guess what?

124
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:13,430
Get more sleep and or,
and,

125
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,590
or cause sometimes you don't have
the choice and you get less sleep.

126
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:20,591
So put yourself in check and try and
get control those emotions instead of

127
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:25,610
acting like a baby. Yeah, I put
in in the warrior could book,

128
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,770
one of the lines is mark,

129
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,830
he's all bummed out in the line was
he started crying like a baby and,

130
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:37,220
and, and the, the editors
were like, you know,

131
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,590
you might not want to say that.
You know,

132
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:44,420
it kind of gives a bad thing
about applying. His name's
pat and Koreans babyish.

133
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,680
And I said,

134
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,570
well no actually you're crying like a
baby and babies cry and you know when

135
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,420
you're a 10 year old kid you
shouldn't be crying like a baby.

136
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,860
And it's him saying about
himself, you know. So they,

137
00:07:56,861 --> 00:07:58,340
they were a little
sensitive about that one.

138
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,610
But once I kind of debriefed him on
it, we look good. The line remained.

139
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,710
Mark in his own words broke down
and started crying like a baby.

140
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,570
So yeah,

141
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:13,571
cause crying like a baby technically is
not the same thing is just normal crying

142
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,470
for stuff. Yeah, that's true.
I'm just trying to like,

143
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,590
because why they say crying like a baby?
Really?

144
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,230
It's probably cause babies cry
for literally everything. Right.

145
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,290
Anything that they're not strict about
the baby crying cause he doesn't know how

146
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:28,460
to talk. So if you're crying like a baby
crying, screaming for every little thing,

147
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,410
there you go. But if you're just crying
over Hawaii five o or, or you know,

148
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,810
whatever the movie is you're watching,
then that's different.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,380
You know what I'm saying? The line
remained. That's the good thing.

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,350
That's the key right there.
Next question.

151
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,950
Any advice for a second lieutenant?

152
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,250
One month into IOC and a couple of
months from standing in front of up Plt

153
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:55,380
platoon, platoon of marines for
the first time? You know what?

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,700
I almost didn't answer this one because
I answered it all the time for every

155
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,580
different person that's
going into leadership isn't,

156
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,510
but I'm going to answer it one more time
just to make sure I'm going to make it

157
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:06,840
brief and to make it quick. But if you're
going into a new leadership position,

158
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,580
whether you're going to be in charge
of a Marine Corps platoon or an army

159
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:16,581
platoon or a seal platoon or a
division at a company or a sports team,

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,690
whatever, you're gonna be in charge of
that. The principles are the same, right?

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,100
We're going to be humble. Number
one, we're going to listen.

162
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,850
We're not going to act like
we know everything cause
we don't because we're new.

163
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,090
There's gonna be a a gunny sergeant in
that platoon that actually does know all

164
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,800
lot of stuff. You don't, you don't
need to go in there asking him,

165
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,860
acting like you do. You're going to
take suggestions, you're going to,

166
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,540
you're going to ask for advice,

167
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,640
you're going to heed the
advice when it comes your way.

168
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Now you're going to work harder than
everybody else that that goes without

169
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:53,610
saying. You're gonna outwork everybody.
They're going to respect that,

170
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,040
and then when the time comes to be
decisive and you've taken on board,

171
00:09:57,041 --> 00:10:01,170
do the various inputs, you're going to
be decisive. Once you've been decisive,

172
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:04,680
that doesn't mean that you're going
to hold on and burn in with that idea,

173
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:07,740
that decision that you made,
you can change your mind sometimes.

174
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,870
That's the one thing that always
freaked me out about politicians when a

175
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:11,680
politician would change their
mind and it wouldn't say, oh,

176
00:10:11,681 --> 00:10:14,670
they're a flip flopper. They
change their mind. You know,

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,180
born information comes to light and
your attitude can, can evolve. You know,

178
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,430
your opinion can evolve. That's not,
that's not a horrible thing to me. Now,

179
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,490
if you have somebody that's flip flopping
their fundamental principles that can

180
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:30,144
obviously,

181
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,150
and if the reason for them doing
that isn't for new information,

182
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,380
it's because they want this person or
that group of people to vote for me.

183
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:42,510
Well then that's obviously
a different thing.

184
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,550
But for you to analyze your decision
and then let it mature and change,

185
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:50,970
that's not that big of a deal. And
it's, and, and people get paranoid that,

186
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,180
that your troops won't respect that.
Like I said,

187
00:10:54,181 --> 00:10:55,080
we were going to come in for the west,

188
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:58,260
so we're just not going to change my
mind cause I'll look weak. No, no, no.

189
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,940
You actually look week by maintaining
a stupid opinion or maintaining course

190
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,170
that's a bad course or a bad
decision. So, so don't do that.

191
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,480
Just be humble, be decisive when you have
to be, or when you, when you need to be.

192
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,120
And then also,

193
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,720
remember there's been all these
other leaders throughout history,

194
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,050
thousands and thousands of years that
have stepped up and taking charge of stuff

195
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:25,980
and got an after it.
So you're gonna make some mistakes.

196
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:30,660
So is everybody. The people that are,
that you're working for made mistakes too.

197
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:33,810
That gunnery sergeant made mistakes,
you know, he wasn't perfect.

198
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,980
So you're going to make mistakes. No, not,

199
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,120
not that big of a deal and make a
mistake. What do you do? Own it.

200
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,020
Learn from it.
Move forward.

201
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,770
So that's what you do with the new
leadership position and good luck,

202
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:54,850
man. The platoon commander, platoon
commander, platoon commander,

203
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:57,610
that's what you want to be and
that's what you got. Go and get it.

204
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,010
Semper fi and thanks for
your service. Yeah, that's,

205
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,710
I think that's one.
My opinion is that the,

206
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,180
this question and this answered that you
just gave that I don't think that gets

207
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:15,180
old because that's a hard one. It
and no one feels comfortable. Yeah.

208
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,580
Actually, let me rephrase that.
The people that feel comfortable,

209
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:20,470
I'm ready to get in there and take charge.

210
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,340
They're generally the least ready and
are going to have the worst performance

211
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:25,320
because their,
their,

212
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:29,440
their ego's big and they believe that
they're going to crush it. This guy,

213
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,820
this second lieutenant, he is humble.
He's aware, he's, you know, hey man,

214
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,620
what can I do? How can it
be ready for this? That's,

215
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,710
that's the perfect place to be at
like a healthy amount of doubt.

216
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,210
Lafe Lafe told that story a couple of
times where when he was the executive

217
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,460
officer to seal team or the
ops officer to seal team,

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,220
if he called out and I
was running training,

219
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,970
so his seal team was going through
training and he would call, you know,

220
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:54,280
the platoon commander of the troop
commander. And he'd say, Hey, you know,

221
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:58,630
how's everything going out there? And if
he, if they answered were crushing it,

222
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,030
life would say, oh we got issues
cause, cause factually he knew,

223
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,640
he knew, he know. He knew
I was running training.

224
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,940
There wasn't anyone's going
to crush the training running.

225
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,100
And so if their answer
wasn't, you know, hey,

226
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:15,670
the training is really hard and we're
doing our best, we're learning a lot.

227
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Those guys, he'd say okay, they're good
to go and I'll go see him, you know,

228
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,300
in a week or so. If they said they
were crushing it, he'd say, yeah,

229
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,440
I'm going to come out and see you guys
tomorrow. And then when they get up there,

230
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,770
he'd say, what's going on? It's
like, yeah, it's not good. So yeah,

231
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:34,771
that attitude of we're crushing it is
generally an indicator of you're probably

232
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:36,760
not doing the best job.

233
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,520
So stay humble indicator of how they're
going to move forward to, you know,

234
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,220
like their attitude and looking for work.
Gosh, I'm doing great. Yeah, no time.

235
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,170
No you're not.
You're not doing great.

236
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,830
None of us are at a minimum
we can do better. Right.

237
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,310
So the minute you say I'm doing
great. Yeah. Going backwards.

238
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,943
Next question.

239
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:05,200
How long did it take you to get promoted
to a blue belt and how often were you

240
00:14:05,201 --> 00:14:09,730
training during that time?
So real simple question.

241
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,050
It took me,

242
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,640
I think about nine or 10 months
to get my blue belt cheap Paula.

243
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,680
And when I was at that
time I ah, I was at, yeah,

244
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,543
at seal team one,

245
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I was in the training department and I
had a lot of opportunity to train at that

246
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:31,990
time.
Clinton years.

247
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:35,590
Not a lot of money to train
that in the seal teams.

248
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:40,480
So less trips, shorter trips, less travel.

249
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,590
So we were staying around a little bit
more, no war going on, on top of all that.

250
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,320
So we were, we were home a
little bit more. And so I
trained all the time. I try,

251
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:54,220
I would go to lunch at lunch, I
would zip over to Fabio Santos. Okay.

252
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,910
And train the lunchtime class.

253
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,980
And then I'd sit back and do
work and then we'd get done.

254
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,960
I'd go back and I would do the beginner
class and then I would do the advanced

255
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:03,560
class.

256
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,180
And then I would roll with Dean and
Higgs and James Nielsen in Craig and the

257
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:12,170
rest of the guys that were there
at Fabio's at the time. And we,

258
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,700
and Fabio used to kick dean and I off
the Mat at like nine o'clock at night.

259
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,270
Take it too long. Yeah. And he'd
say, why don't you guys get a life?

260
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,090
Why do you do it? And we'd say, we're just
writing the duty to say, we got a life.

261
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,660
It's right here. Yeah, I'm
living. This is it. It did.

262
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,430
And so it was mostly at Fabio's like you
know how you said you'd like train with

263
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,790
your, you know, your guys who
weren't trained to whatever
was there that going on?

264
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,040
Yeah. Yeah. Anybody that
wanted a roll with me,

265
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,640
I had the same policy that
I have right now. You wanna
roll. Cool. Yeah, let's roll.

266
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,880
Well I have my gear,
it's in my bag right now.

267
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,910
If you want to train and we'll try it.

268
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,380
Oh it's Thursday afternoon and it's two
o'clock and we don't have any work to do

269
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:56,960
and you want to turn cold, we'll try it.
So yeah, I was doing that all the time.

270
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,290
And the thing is once I got blue belt,

271
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,570
cause I think I got blue belt
pretty pretty quickly and,

272
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,190
but I was a blue belt for a
long time because, because I,

273
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,360
right as I was probably getting
close to getting my purple belt,

274
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,243
I left,

275
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:16,940
I left California and I went to Virginia
Beach once I got to Virginia Beach,

276
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,810
stepped into a new Dojo
with Gustavo Machado.

277
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,510
And you started training with Gustavo
and, and I'm just a blue belt. Right.

278
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,980
And so he's got to know,

279
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,470
learn me and fee figured out
what my personality is like,

280
00:16:30,471 --> 00:16:33,170
see what my potential is as a person.

281
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,080
And I trained really hard there,

282
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:38,630
but I was also gone a lot traveling and
that's when I was traveling a lot on the

283
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,060
road and I would train with guys on
the road and it went on deployment,

284
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:45,020
trained with guys on deployment and
then it would come back into town.

285
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,310
And so I didn't get consistent enough
with him eyes with him where he said, hey,

286
00:16:49,311 --> 00:16:50,930
this guy's ready for his purple Belch.

287
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,260
So by the time I might've
been close to him thinking,

288
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,430
okay, you know what I mean? You
start looking to him for purple belt,

289
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,900
went back to San Diego, got
back to San Diego, and now,

290
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,910
now I check back into Fabio's.
Well it's been two years, bro.

291
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,970
You need to, you, we know you
need to prove yourself again.

292
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,370
So it was almost like I
was at the bottom of the,

293
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,120
of the pecking order in
terms of time in rain,

294
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,190
even though I'd been a
blue belt for a long time.

295
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:22,190
So I ended up being a
blue belt for a long time.

296
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,220
I want to say it was a blue
belt for maybe like five years.

297
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,500
Yeah. And I was a good blue
belt. Don't get me wrong sir.

298
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:35,501
Of course who were and but you know there
was a long time when you jump around

299
00:17:36,141 --> 00:17:39,650
from school to school and the instructor
doesn't know you well enough and

300
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:43,290
doesn't see you on a regular basis
and can assess your employment.

301
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:47,390
Cause that's the thing with
Jujitsu in my opinion, for your,

302
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,800
you don't get your,

303
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,870
there's not a level playing field
for every person. So in other words,

304
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,041
it's not,

305
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,730
hey these are the skills required for
blue belt and now you get your blue belt

306
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,430
and then you've learned these other for,
you know,

307
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,120
these other hundred and 27 other
moves and now you get your purple bow.

308
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,900
Now there's 310 moves to get your,
it's not like that at all.

309
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,990
And in fact it's also not,
hey,

310
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,370
how do you as a blue belt do against this
other group of blue belts? What it is,

311
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:19,950
and I know this sounds a
little bit cliche, but it's,

312
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,630
it's really how good are you against you,
right?

313
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,850
Because if somebody you know,
you,

314
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:31,320
let's say you get somebody that starts
with Jujitsu when they're older,

315
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,930
you know,
maybe they're 55 years old,

316
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:39,140
they're going to go and they train
until they're 62 or their training and

317
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,570
training and training, their skill
level, they're getting injured,

318
00:18:42,571 --> 00:18:44,890
they're having issues, they
gotta work, they got up,

319
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,520
they get up and do a bunch of other
things and they can't, they're a hobbyist,

320
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:49,530
right? They're not focused and
they can only train so much.

321
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,730
They learned the moves, they
get better. 10 years go by,

322
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,880
there's a chance that they're going to
be a black belt based on the fact that

323
00:18:56,881 --> 00:18:57,181
hey,

324
00:18:57,181 --> 00:19:01,410
as a 55 year old person that came in
here and started training and moves that

325
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:05,220
you've learned and how you've applied
them according to your athletic ability

326
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:08,580
and your physical capability at
the time, Hey, it's been 10 years,

327
00:19:08,581 --> 00:19:11,550
which is a pretty rough number for like,
you know, for getting your black belt.

328
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,460
So that's acceptable.

329
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,490
But you might get a kid that's a really
good athlete that in two years can

330
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:25,360
destroy that guy. Yeah. And he's not
getting his black belt because you're,

331
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:28,560
you're saying what is your potential?
How good can you be as a black belt?

332
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:32,010
That's the question.
So really it's almost a compliment.

333
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,090
The longer it takes you to get your
belts, that means, in my opinion,

334
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:37,470
that means the better you're going to,

335
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,150
that means the better that your instructor
thinks you're going to be. That's my,

336
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,160
that's my thought. And not everyone
does it like that. And you know,

337
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:48,440
some people think, oh, if, if this purple
belt can be that purple belt, you know,

338
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,440
this purple belts better.

339
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,380
And if this purple belt can beat the
Brown belt than I need to give him his

340
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,420
brown belt. Not Too many things
people think that way. You know,

341
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,430
who thinks that way? The purple
belt, I can meet the Brown belt,

342
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,910
I should be a brown belt.
No wrong. So, so true.

343
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,640
And this, so many. Um,

344
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,990
there's so many of those little things
like the reason an instructor might be

345
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,930
influenced to give,

346
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,140
I mean typically they're not going to
give someone a belt based solely on the

347
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:19,570
fact that he taps out that,
you know, Brown belt. So,

348
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,950
but it is influenced by that is
there's all these weird things.

349
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,000
There's stuff like sometimes I'm watching
like a two blue belts and they'll see

350
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:31,530
that I'm watching and it turns into
a death match. What's APP actually,

351
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:33,660
you know what, that's, I just saw
a video of a guy with a commuter.

352
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,800
I think you put it on on social media.
What kind of injured his elbow.

353
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:39,900
You think cause look like his elbow.
Yeah.

354
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:44,460
Maybe like crap didn't tap to the
camera. The camera is a beast, man.

355
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,890
You come here as a beast, you know,
you can not tap to a foot lock.

356
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,140
You can not tap too. You can even
not tap to a heal hook. Yeah,

357
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,310
he'll hook can go really sideways,

358
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,300
but you don't have to come euro and
you're probably gonna have some issues.

359
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,930
It's so terrible to watch. Like,
I think as I get their, you know,

360
00:21:01,931 --> 00:21:06,550
their knee and stuff in a heel hook
and it's like, it's like, oh Dang that.

361
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,030
But man, the camera when you see the
guys arm just doesn't that way. Man.

362
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,900
I did it post that video
that someone else it,

363
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,480
I would never post videos like that.
In fact, I don't like don't watch that.

364
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,003
I saw what I've,

365
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,130
is that what I did to your shoulder
according to the success almost separated

366
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:27,310
your shoulder separated and
did not people not do that.

367
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,220
I know it sounded nice and dramatic,
but it didn't happen.

368
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,220
I don't think you've ever almost
that's I'll do my shoulder. Yeah.

369
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,453
But as far as,

370
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,310
as far as people getting
instructors getting influenced
on why to give guys belt

371
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:47,140
or a higher belt, like some instructors
for example, the bill be influenced now,

372
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,010
but uh,

373
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:52,300
to give a guy hired belt because I
want to have more black belts under me.

374
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:52,820
You know,

375
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,530
we have a team of black
belts and typically that'll
have a lot to do with sales.

376
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,370
You know, like where I can be like, Hey,
I have, you know, a team of, you know,

377
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:03,760
and I've heard the sales pitch, you know,
where it's like, hey, we have seven,

378
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:07,120
seven black belts on the mat, three world
champ. You know, that's good. That's good.

379
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:09,850
So people might be influenced by
that. And then there'll be like, okay,

380
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:12,550
maybe I'll give these two guys they're
belt cause and so now we have four black

381
00:22:12,551 --> 00:22:17,200
belts or whatever. There's that. And
then if that's the reason, you know,

382
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,090
I mean it is good to have 10 black
belts in your association that is,

383
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,360
give it to the gym. Yeah, for sure.
And, but then there's the opposite too,

384
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,060
or guys will be like,
if they're at,

385
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,210
and this typically happens if they're
competing. So if a coach is like a,

386
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:33,010
I got these five brown belts,

387
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:37,090
they're obviously on the level of
black belt knowledge, performance,

388
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,520
all this stuff. But when they go into
the tournament in the brown belt level,

389
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,760
we got gold medals,
gold team medals every time.

390
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,260
So then there's that situation
again. Sandbagging. Exactly.
Right. So there's, yeah,

391
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:51,370
there's all those things in regards
to the belt. I said this before,

392
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,533
I'm gonna say it again.

393
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,120
The belt really doesn't have to do with
how good you think you are or how good

394
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:01,960
even you know you are.
If you're like, Hey,

395
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,710
I'm tapping, you know, I'm
a white belt. For example,

396
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:08,110
I'm a white belt and I'm
hanging with the purple belt.

397
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:12,520
I'm tapping blue belts and brown belts
are gay. I'm giving them a hard time

398
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,690
so I should be a blue belt.
It doesn't matter. Doesn't
matter at all. And you know,

399
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,650
it sounds like an exaggeration.
It doesn't matter.

400
00:23:20,651 --> 00:23:22,480
It all new to us a little bit
here was saying, no, it doesn't.

401
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,510
Your skill is evaluated
by your instructor.

402
00:23:25,511 --> 00:23:28,690
That's the reason why you can
be at a certain level, leave,

403
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,410
come back and still not be because your,
your instructor,

404
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:36,240
you can be quite dominating everywhere.
The instructor has to evaluate that.

405
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,940
So that's exactly what happened with me.
And it wasn't a negative thing.

406
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:41,230
It was like, Hey, you've
been gone for two years.

407
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:42,430
We got to see where you're at Jocko.

408
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,100
And it's not just one day being either
back in here and get your purple belt just

409
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,330
because you've been training
for two straight years. Yeah.
It doesn't matter. Yeah.

410
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,990
I know what's interesting too is this,

411
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,570
obviously this applies to
people in the business world.

412
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:58,080
People trying to get promoted and
and the more you're thinking, Hey, I,

413
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,940
I'm better at this job than
this guy should get. There's
something else going on.

414
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,390
There's something that you look at and
the more frustrated you get about not

415
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:09,290
getting that promotion, not getting
taken care of, not getting noticed,

416
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,530
just do your job,
work hard.

417
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,610
You know the don't worry about the
promotion and approach promotions going to

418
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,130
come in most cases.
Yeah.

419
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,050
So mine was,

420
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,330
I wouldn't even frame it where I would
say in all cases there are exceptions

421
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,840
like everything else, but in, in
all cases, that is the situation.

422
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,760
And think about this too, when you, when
you, in regards to like your belt, right?

423
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,640
Do you get to belt?
If I'm a white belt Jocko year,

424
00:24:37,641 --> 00:24:42,170
my instructor and I'm like,
Hey, I'm winning all these
tournaments, all of them.

425
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,600
Gold nut, a point score,
all by submission.

426
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,560
I'm talking about blue belt and
purple belt sometimes. Hey Jocko,

427
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:52,970
gimme my blue belt. I can't do
that. You, you, it's not up to me.

428
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,780
Even if I beg you, I go on the
Internet, I post this petition,

429
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,630
it's not up to me. See,
this is, this is the thing,

430
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,730
you know when you hear in martial arts,
like old traditional martial arts,

431
00:25:04,731 --> 00:25:06,620
like you will learn humility.
Yeah.

432
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,030
And you will learn discipline and they
would teach it. You know, by teaching it,

433
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,510
by talking about it in
Jujitsu, it's real. Yeah. Look,

434
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:19,511
you will be humble and
when you flare up and say,

435
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:24,170
where's my belt? That's you not being
humble. That's you. Not just saying, Hey,

436
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:26,330
I need to work harder. I need
to keep getting after it. Yeah.

437
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,690
And so you're learning that lesson
and that's part of the lesson.

438
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:32,130
This was the way it she'll
be. You know, and again, I,

439
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,590
I've mentioned this before on the podcast,

440
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:35,660
just because someone is a Jujitsu person,

441
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,750
just because they're a black belt
doesn't mean they have the same.

442
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,080
That doesn't mean they have
like the best morals and values.

443
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:44,810
It doesn't mean that at all.
There can be people selling belts.

444
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,320
There's people that sell belt.
Oh you,

445
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,420
you going to take 10 privates with
me $1,000 each and then, then you'll,

446
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,780
that's how you get the black
belt. Okay, cool. No, not cool.

447
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,240
As soon as a bunch of things
like that too, you know, oh,

448
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:58,970
I want you to go open a pilot
school for me somewhere,

449
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,760
so I'm going to give you your black belt.
You're not that good.

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,790
So that way you can, you
can give me my, you know,

451
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,870
12% of your annual earnings and
things like that happen and there's,

452
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:12,800
you know,
even worse things that happened.

453
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,490
But the bottom line is
an impure jujitsu sense.

454
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,560
You should be working hard and
getting promoted as it comes from your

455
00:26:21,561 --> 00:26:22,790
instructor.
Yeah.

456
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,300
So essentially the promote this sort of
like an indirect way of you talking to

457
00:26:26,301 --> 00:26:29,740
me about your belt, but no, not
at all actually. Actually it,

458
00:26:29,741 --> 00:26:32,780
if it does apply to me,
I say it doesn't matter.

459
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:36,470
You don't even care well less
than anyone cares or doesn't care.

460
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,600
Of course I think everyone
cares in one way or another.

461
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,010
But I'd say the approach it more has
to do with the approach. Like just like

462
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,190
how you said, focus on getting better
folks on the learning. That's it.

463
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:49,510
The belt is just a symptom
of your learning. It's a,

464
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,900
it's an eventuality essentially.

465
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,450
Same thing or back to the fact that
doesn't have anything to do with the Co,

466
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,710
the person. Only the instructor. On the
flip side of what I said about, you know,

467
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,420
if I think I'm, I've, I think I'm a blue
belt and I'm not getting my blue belt,

468
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,580
what's up? It's not up to me. It's
something instructor. No matter what.

469
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,200
Same thing is if you, you're like,
hey, promotion time. Hey Echo,

470
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:14,550
here's your blue belt. And I'm like, I'm
not ready for this. Bluebell. I suck. I'm,

471
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,000
I can't even do this. Well,
I can't give the belt back.

472
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,270
I can't like take it off and
then put it, you know, I mean,

473
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,500
I'm sure there's some kind of excitement.

474
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,410
There was that thing that happened
long time ago with, um, with ensign.

475
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,080
There wasn't a loss. It was like a year
ago. Yeah. That's a long time ago. Okay.

476
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,790
But nonetheless, you know, I can't give
it back to you. When you get demoted,

477
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,210
you're ready for it.
So put your belt on and start,

478
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,880
start getting after it has nothing
to do with your opinion. That's the,

479
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:42,750
that's the point there. So yeah, it's your
inner strength to keep training. Yeah.

480
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:45,260
Because sometimes people get their belts
and they stopped training. Yeah. That,

481
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,590
and that's an India.
Here's the thing,

482
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,420
all admit there was a point in my life
where I was like, concerned about that.

483
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,970
I'm like, well, I'm, you know, I'm better
than this guy. I'm not going to say when,

484
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,900
which belt? It was not recently
mind you, but like three weeks ago,

485
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,660
I guess I shouldn't say it, but then I
remember and when I think about that time,

486
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:07,290
man, I wasn't learning that much at all.
I was just focusing on like, whoa, good.

487
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:11,130
I do. So like, you know, your game kind
of is closed off. You don't learn much.

488
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,660
You're concerned about, you know,
all this stuff and if he's happy,

489
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,910
he's exactly right. Your risks not
learning. Yes, exactly right and gets you.

490
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,610
And it just messes up your whole
Jujitsu experience because you had that,

491
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,450
you have that added, added element
of stress. It's not good. Do that.

492
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,090
Don't even ask about belts. I
think that's a good, that isn't,

493
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:33,810
that is a great policy that
that's the best policy for belts.

494
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,110
Don't ask him to train hard and you'll
get what's coming to you eventually.

495
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,200
But sometimes people will ask you, hey,
when are you going to get your blue belt?

496
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:43,710
Or you know, you know, people will ask you
that whenever, I dunno. Yeah, whatever.

497
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,990
My instructor asked me what I'm
gonna get the red and black belt.

498
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,680
I'll just kidding. No one
asked me that. The Coral Belle.

499
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,450
Interesting. Yeah. Good. Next question.

500
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,140
What's the best approach to
managing people that outperform you?

501
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,480
Okay.
I think this is a simple question as well.

502
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,500
What you do in this situation is you
give them all the support you can and let

503
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:13,740
them run. I'm, I'm happy if someone's
outperform me. That's great.

504
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:16,110
You know what do I'll do? Try and learn
from him and see what they're doing.

505
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,280
I'll try and spread the word.

506
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,120
If I'm in a leadership
position in someone's doing
outperforming everyone, great.

507
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,520
How can we take that?
How can we teach to everyone else?

508
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,950
How can I give them support so
they can re run even faster?

509
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,080
This is no factor to me.
I love it.

510
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,930
You should be surrounding the more people
you can bring on your team that how

511
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,400
perform you,
the better you're going to do.

512
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,273
True

513
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,130
check. Easy money. Next
question. Next. Yeah.

514
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,730
A lot of times it's hard though. You
know, and I know you're going to say ego.

515
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,630
Oh, am I going to say it that boy, is
it not true? We know it's your ego.

516
00:29:49,631 --> 00:29:52,750
It's 100% of you go when you can't support
somebody that's doing better than you.

517
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,140
It's 100% ego. Why else
would you not support them?
They're helping the team win.

518
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,290
They're helping everyone do better.
Why would you not support them?

519
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:03,220
Because your ego, because
you're like, Ooh, that hurts.
Yeah, I want to be the guy.

520
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,840
And you know what you look like.
Then you look like a jealous baby,

521
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,460
little baby word of the day,
baby.

522
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,270
You literally look jealous little baby
because you're trying to hold them back

523
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:17,410
and everyone can see it and everyone
can tell it. Just don't be that person.

524
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:21,730
That's a good point right there.
Everyone can tell what's going on.

525
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,720
It's one of those dichotomies is,

526
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,780
is that people can be so ignorant to
things and yet so perceptive to things.

527
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:36,970
Yeah. So and the things like that,
they're so perceptive to echo,

528
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:38,950
doesn't like to see Jocko out shine him.

529
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,040
That's why he's trying to hold them back
or he's not sending him on that trip.

530
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,470
We're just going to win that deal. Oh,
he's going to go instead. Yeah. Hey,

531
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,740
I won the deal guys.
Yeah, I'm great, no wrong.

532
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,270
And even down to the smallest little
things like you know, hey, um, you know,

533
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,970
I don't know. We'll see. John
is against your subordinate.

534
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,250
You're jealous of him
because he's cause he's dope.

535
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,240
And when someone gives John a
compliment about how good he did,

536
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,770
just the little looking on your face.
So obvious you don't know.

537
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,890
And you know how you say some people are,

538
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,480
are people are so like ignorant of
some things in silver perceptive.

539
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,170
They're ignorant about this stuff. When
it applies to them, he was somebody else.

540
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:20,490
It's like, Oh yeah, I'll point
those out all day. Good points.

541
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:23,530
Like when people in the, I got
this Sam Harris, he pointed,

542
00:31:23,531 --> 00:31:27,200
he had this example where name dropping
when you're, you know, when you,

543
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,360
when you do some name dropping, not
everyone, but most people, it's like,

544
00:31:31,361 --> 00:31:34,510
it's easier to recognize it when
other people need drop the one they do

545
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:38,530
themselves, you know, it's so
funny. All chill in theirs.

546
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,180
If I name drop,

547
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:44,880
I immediately feel like
flush of just disgust is,

548
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,000
oh my God, that's so bad.
Yeah. Yeah. It's true.

549
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,660
So bad. But it's hard to kind of know
to, you know, you know, speaking of that,

550
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:56,170
I was just texting back and forth with
Tim Ferriss and Joe Rogan the other day

551
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:01,150
named job. I'm just kidding.
That's how you know that's a,

552
00:32:01,151 --> 00:32:04,090
that's a um, excessive name drop when
you say their first and their last,

553
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,760
that's it. You know, and then
we'll, I don't know what's
worse. I was just texting.

554
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,140
I just got a text from Tim. He was
letting me know about that. Yeah,

555
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:15,280
you're a Tim who? Tim
Ferriss. Joe Hogan. My boy.

556
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,360
We were kicking it old
school that's like, um, uh,

557
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,530
like pseudo advanced name dropping where,
where uh,

558
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,840
you say the first name like that,
but like,

559
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:26,270
like amateur named dropping
his first and last name. Okay.

560
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,310
So I was actually black belt
namedropping he just first name,

561
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,600
first name base. Actually more like
one straight white belt. You know,

562
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,570
it's just a little bit more advanced.
It's still namedropping is,

563
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:40,100
what's the height?
Is there a way to appropriately namedrop

564
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,300
somehow? How do you do that? Right.
I'm sure they did not say their name.

565
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,720
I was talking to someone the other day,
so this is a similar situation.

566
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,810
I was talking to, you know, met
some people the other day and, and,

567
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,840
and the girl says, you
will, you know I, oh yeah.

568
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,600
We were talking about the east coast
and she's, Oh yeah. I went to college,

569
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,360
I went to college in Cambridge and it
was, you know, it's, it's a good place.

570
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,580
And I was thinking of myself,
I didn't, I, you know, Oh,
where'd you go to school? No,

571
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,670
we'll leave it at that. Yeah. But
that was sort of a high level job.

572
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,130
I lived in Cambridge. That's where
I went to college all in one call.

573
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:16,300
Just talk about going on out
there. Right, right. You know. Oh,

574
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,980
was that a high level, was it or was
that just an honest conversation? Yeah.

575
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:25,820
It might've been, just might've been
just her not wanting to sound like,

576
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,300
yeah,

577
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,190
you know, hey, you don't,
right. She didn't want to,

578
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,860
she didn't essentially want to name
drop for the reason that people normally

579
00:33:33,861 --> 00:33:34,694
named job.

580
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,370
But here's what I think there is a
weighted like effectively in like

581
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:43,360
legitimately if for lack
of a better term name drop.

582
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,620
And that's like if you, if you cause
namedropping typically, so you know,

583
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,520
it's almost like a weak attempt
at breezing over, you know,

584
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:57,790
I'm fixing with Joe Rogan or they'll
like say their little credentials.

585
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,910
But I think if you say,
you know,

586
00:34:01,911 --> 00:34:04,280
I was texting with my friend
and he was actually Joe Rogan,

587
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:09,470
you know that and you make it like a
point the size that this wasn't just

588
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:12,560
anyone. It was Joe. You're actually
excited about it. Yes. You know? Exactly.

589
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:15,280
So that I think that's an
effective way cause it Kinda,

590
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,290
you kinda can maintain your humility
there. Yeah. But you don't want to be,

591
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:20,570
we're like, you know, I'm just
texting with my boy Joe Rogan,

592
00:34:20,571 --> 00:34:24,190
whatever kind of thing where like I'm
just no big deal. No big deal. That's,

593
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,190
it'd be diva anyway. Cool. Wait,

594
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,140
I digress. Yeah. All right, next question.

595
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,560
Okay.

596
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,870
What would be a good
approach to effectively

597
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,500
what would be a good approach
to effectively leading
a team where instead of

598
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,770
taking ownership of their responsibilities
and working towards team goals,

599
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,470
each team member is just
trying to be the boss.

600
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:56,560
Okay, so a couple things here. Eat, eat.

601
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,930
You want to let them be the
boss of their tasks, right?

602
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,350
That's what you're trying to do. So that,
that makes sense. And one of the ways,

603
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,300
if they're,
if they want to be the boss of everything,

604
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:08,270
maybe you give them a little bit more
as much decision making process that you

605
00:35:08,271 --> 00:35:11,810
can as to what tasks or what
projects they're in charge of.

606
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:14,750
So that makes them feel a little bit like
they're empowered and I shouldn't say,

607
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:17,590
makes them feel like they're empowered.
You actually are empowered. Yeah.

608
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,680
You know what I mean?
So there's a,

609
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,140
there's a pretty significant
distinction because once again,

610
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:25,250
people will recognize if you're just
letting them do it to make them feel good

611
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:27,890
about it, they're going to know
that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Jocko,

612
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:31,050
thanks for the decision. You gave
me a choice of one thing. Thank you.

613
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,970
The color of the hens we're
using. So, so you know,

614
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
maybe let them really there
a 40 in leadership on owning
what it is that they're

615
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,193
owning.

616
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,920
But the question says they're not taking
ownership of their responsibilities.

617
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,760
So let's make sure first that we're not,
that,

618
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,970
that we're giving them full reign and
full ownership of their responsibilities

619
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:57,060
and we're not micro managing in there.
Now if that,

620
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,180
if we're beyond that and,

621
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:02,730
and we got people that just want
to be in charge of the whole thing.

622
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,180
Well cool. That's,
that's actually awesome.

623
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:08,130
You want to be in charge of
everything of Echo is a isn't it?

624
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,740
Our team and he wants to be in
charge of everything. Hey guys,

625
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:14,430
check it out right now.
This next project that we're working,

626
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,540
echo is going to run it.
I'm going to sit back and by the way,

627
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,130
next project bill, you're running
and next project, Fred, year running.

628
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,450
Now we're all going to get to actually
get in the hot seat and he and I,

629
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,190
I'll tell you what you're going to see.
Number one,

630
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:30,024
you're gonna see some people that go,

631
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,040
they wanted to sit in the back of Cerp
but they don't actually want to be

632
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:38,790
responsible for anything, so that puts
them to rest right away. You're also,

633
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:41,130
what's going to happen with everybody
is they're all going to see that this

634
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:44,130
thing that looks so easy from the back
of the room is a lot harder than they

635
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:46,230
think. That's what it's
like running a seal mission.

636
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:48,510
The guy in the back that's never
been in charge before. It's like, oh,

637
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:52,560
we should just do it like this.
Yeah. And that guy, you say, okay,

638
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,910
here you run this, and then you know,
in six hours they come up and say, Hey,

639
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,480
oh yeah,

640
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,400
you give me a head with how we were
supposed to contact and deconflict with

641
00:37:02,401 --> 00:37:04,440
these other units. Oh, okay. It's
a little trickier than you thought.

642
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,274
Maybe isn't it?

643
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,810
But you actually put people in charge of
things if they want to be in charge of

644
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,120
things, put them in charge of
things. It's great. And you know,

645
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:14,610
don't let them fall on her face. Don't
let him get anyone killed. Don't let him,

646
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:19,170
you know, get anyone he injured
or lose any strategic ground.

647
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,340
We're not going to do that,

648
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:24,630
but we're going to let them have the
opportunity to step up and lead it if they

649
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:29,310
do a good job. Sweet.
Sweet. Now you've got them.

650
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:31,350
You can rely on them. You can actually
put them in charge of projects.

651
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:33,870
Now you don't have to micromanage. We
don't have to watch over them. This is a,

652
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,990
this is a no lose situation.
This happened actually one of my,

653
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,280
one of my platoon was going through
training and one of the platoon commanders

654
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,430
came up to me.

655
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,670
We were just putting them in a platoon
through training and he comes up and he's,

656
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,840
Oh, my platoon chief wants to
run everything, and I said, good.

657
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,690
Let him run everything. Let him
run everything. That's perfect.

658
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:56,700
Then you can focus on, you know, other
things. Don't worry about it, but ego,

659
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,050
right? We want to be running everything
we want the, I'm, I'm the guy in charge.

660
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,780
Yeah. No, let him run it.
And it's just, it's, it's,

661
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,560
it's the,
the reason,

662
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,770
the thing that holds people back from
letting other people run things is

663
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:14,370
insecurity. If I think echo is
going to do a better job than me,

664
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,950
or I think you're gonna do a really
good job and you're going to shine,

665
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:19,610
and I don't feel like I do a good job,
I'm gonna hold you back.

666
00:38:19,611 --> 00:38:23,610
Is the best of my ability to be
like, no. I go, oh, you go ahead.

667
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,210
You go ahead and just stay in your lane.
They're putting that piece over here. No,

668
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:32,720
but if I, if I, if I know, if
I'm secure in my leadership man,

669
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,940
Echo, oh, you want to run this
dude? Awesome. Here you go.
Here's the plan. Once you,

670
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,000
you know, here's the, here's
the portfolio. Why don't
you put the plan together?

671
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:43,180
I'm going to be over here looking down
the road on their next project and

672
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,920
looking for our next
song thing down the road,

673
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,410
going out and getting another
client to bring into the game.

674
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,510
We're going to make this happen. No
factor. Yeah. Seems like counterintuitive,

675
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:55,240
isn't it? Yeah, it is. You
want to, you want me to say,

676
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,970
here's how your keep the people in
their lanes. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

677
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,100
I'm going to tell you what you do.
Let them out of their lands.

678
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,500
Let them into your lane.
Let him run some stuff.

679
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,490
Build a new leader to beautiful thing.

680
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,950
When you, you know, when
you're insecure you want,

681
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,830
you don't want them to shout
out, shine you. You know?

682
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,520
You can tell that where I think
it's natural though. You know,

683
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:21,490
when people maybe a little insecure,
you know,

684
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,730
or if you're not as good
as maybe you hope or what.

685
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,150
I think it's natural to be a little
bit insecure. Of course. Here's how,

686
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,640
here's how, in my experience anyway, where
I could tell where I'm being insecure,

687
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,080
where if someone's performing a
certain thing and you're kind of like,

688
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,980
you can feel it consciously, you kind
of hope that they don't do that good,

689
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,790
but man that I know, rats bad, it's bad.

690
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,030
But that's how you can tell them how you
can tell you. If you have that feeling,

691
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:50,720
you should. You should
definitely, if you have that
feeling, check yourself. Go, God,

692
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:51,311
you know what,

693
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:55,870
here I am hoping that my own team
member I know doesn't do a good job.

694
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,630
Yeah,
that's fast and bad situation real bad.

695
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,700
You want to hope everyone's doing great.
Yeah.

696
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:04,480
And you know this happened on deployment
and I talk about it in the book.

697
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,710
Extreme ownership was, you know,
the Delta platoon commander,

698
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,870
he was worried that this element
that had come in to work in his AOE,

699
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,500
he was worried that they were going to
be better than him and take his job.

700
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,240
And he told me that and I said, hey
bro, if they take your job, good,

701
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,640
I'll find a new job for you.
There's so much work we got work to do.

702
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:23,020
Don't worry about it.
Help them,

703
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,260
help them take your job and
I'll find you a new job.

704
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,130
It turns out that their egos were too
big and they couldn't let that happen.

705
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,370
But that's the same situation.

706
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,100
You've got somebody that thinks is going
to take your job and do better than you.

707
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,230
Help them and then find new work cause
cause we're trying to help the team.

708
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:42,064
Right.
There's a mission,

709
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:46,000
there's overall mission and echo can
do something better than me. Hey,

710
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,830
here's the turnover.
Here's the lessons I learned.

711
00:40:47,831 --> 00:40:50,260
You're better at this than I am.
You keep running with it.

712
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,220
I'm going to go find something that
I'm good at or an area that I can help.

713
00:40:55,590 --> 00:41:00,540
That's just supporting the
whole team. That's a window. So,

714
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:04,960
and you know what,
sitting in the podcast studio,

715
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:09,250
it's so easy to talk about that,
but it's so hard for people to do that.

716
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:13,000
It really is really is one of those things
where you're dealing with your actual

717
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,410
feelings in the situation.

718
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:17,620
We're not dealing with our actual feelings
in situation right now, but which,

719
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:20,920
but it doesn't that mean that
it's, that's good. You know,

720
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,840
you're giving a fresh view. You are,
yeah. You know you are detached,

721
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,820
accurate advice and the more detached,
and you pointed out some red flags, right?

722
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,470
If I'm hoping that these guys
go on the mission and fail,

723
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:38,390
that's a red flag that you're
being selfish and insecure
about your job and what

724
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:42,920
you're doing. And if someone can do a
job better than you, let them do it,

725
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:46,640
that's going to help the whole team.
Yeah,

726
00:41:46,641 --> 00:41:50,480
so it's like your us in the
podcast room, we're like, you know,

727
00:41:50,481 --> 00:41:52,040
if you get a guy in the maze,

728
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,150
the maze of emotions and we're
outside of the mains on top,

729
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:59,510
we can see the whole maze. We're not in
the middle of emotions. We're on top.

730
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,680
We can look at the whole scenario,

731
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:05,030
the homeys so we can tell that
guy what to do effectively. Echo,

732
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:08,840
you just described detachment.
There you go with detachment is like that.

733
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,330
That's what, that's what, that's
what it's like for me. Yeah.

734
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:16,450
I can see the maze and I remember learning
how to step back and step above and

735
00:42:17,211 --> 00:42:20,930
look to mace. I remember. Yeah, I
remember learning that and going, oh,

736
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:22,280
that's all I've got to do.
Yeah.

737
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:27,110
And then I remember taking it from the
training ground the battlefield and then

738
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,440
realizing that that's what you need to
do in the everyday interactions with

739
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:32,690
people. And especially once
I got in the business world.

740
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,260
The thing that was cool about
when we started echelon front,

741
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,000
now I would be witnessing like we, I'd go
into a meeting and I would be detached.

742
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:46,001
I would be up above the maze of emotions
in turmoil and so now I would get to

743
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,050
see it and then I would start
bringing the leadership and saying,

744
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,910
look at what this looks like to me.
You know, they'd go, I don't like that.

745
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,880
I don't like that one too.
The video to go into the video and,

746
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:01,790
and so then that's how you learn.
We didn't go to the video.

747
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,730
Look what it looks like from up
above the maze and now you see,

748
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,650
you see what you were
doing here in your meeting.

749
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,310
You had everybody so intimidated
that no one's said anything.

750
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,560
You just gave a 15 minute meeting.

751
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,590
No one responded in any
way to anything you said.

752
00:43:15,591 --> 00:43:18,650
Do you think everyone in that room agreed
with everything you said? Not a chance.

753
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:21,830
They didn't say a word. Why is that
you intimidated them, you bullied them,

754
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,530
and now you're not getting any feedback
and they're going to execute the plan

755
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,364
that they don't believe in.

756
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,920
And that's probably less effective than
the one that they have coming from the

757
00:43:27,921 --> 00:43:32,360
field. Yeah. Congratulations.
Congratulations. No
knock. Congratulations.

758
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,060
Let's get this fixed. Congratulate
like, you know, so, uh,

759
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:41,480
I was in the, in traffic,
in some of the things about,

760
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,890
I was in traffic and you know how
the, you have the two lanes, right?

761
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,190
So I'm going to turn left on the
light in the lane next to me.

762
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:50,024
They're going straight.

763
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,800
So whoever the person in front of
the person that was next to me,

764
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:57,650
both Queen Street,
they were taking too long.

765
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,840
So the lady next honking the horn, all
credit, like going like this, all crazy.

766
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:06,650
So of course I look over at it and
she's going crazy. She looks over at me.

767
00:44:06,651 --> 00:44:10,040
She's like, like, do you believe this
kind of thing all by nuts. Meanwhile,

768
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:14,090
I'm looking at myself, you know, other
people around me, they're just like, well,

769
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,710
this lady's going nuts.
You know?

770
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,720
So that's an example of being
on the outside looking in her.

771
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,450
She thought it was justifiable
honking the horn looking nuts,

772
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:26,500
but meanwhile we're on the
outside looking at her like, Bro,

773
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,520
you know how you look and you
know what that situation is.

774
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:33,600
You didn't have to be,
she did well.

775
00:44:33,601 --> 00:44:36,090
Is that a red light? She was.
You know what I'm saying though?

776
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:41,091
She's a person that hadn't left for late
work late and she was going to be in

777
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:45,790
trouble and blah, blah blah, and that
that 30 seconds that that ten second,

778
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:49,080
that eight seconds, it was probably
like three was an attorney for her.

779
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,780
She's just going nuts.
Just like I was talking about the airport.

780
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:54,480
If I'm running late for the flight,
TSA takes five minutes.

781
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,720
It could be no factor or it could drive
me completely insane meal and that's,

782
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,290
that was her, and you know what?
These days when I screw something up,

783
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:07,080
I don't get frustrated like that. You
know? That's what we're talking about.

784
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:09,900
The first question, I'm like, oh
my God, I look at myself and God,

785
00:45:09,901 --> 00:45:13,020
I can't believe I left late to do this.
I'm an idiot.

786
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,790
I won't let that happen again.

787
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:18,240
I said that in 1996 and I
haven't had to let it happen. So

788
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,310
see what I mean though,
I was outside.

789
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:25,140
The main thing I know she
didn't know how she's feeling.

790
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,400
These guys not going goal greenlight
go. It's time to go universal. Yeah.

791
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,740
So I understand the feeling, but look
how you look from the outside. You know,

792
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,950
did she check herself at
all? No. When she saw you,

793
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:42,470
she looked at to me for some emotional
support as if you believe this guy,

794
00:45:42,471 --> 00:45:46,550
you know, get crazy with me kind
of thing. That was the look.

795
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:51,920
Yeah man. It's like dig it.
That's, I think that's another, uh,

796
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:56,210
understand the difference between
feeling and behavior as well. You know,

797
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,060
like I feel, I know that's a
frustrating thing. It can be,

798
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:04,400
but don't behave like that.
Calm down person. Next question.

799
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,500
What have you learned about yourself or
learn in general over the course of the

800
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:11,690
last 70 plus podcasts?

801
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:14,890
So the,

802
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:19,870
the biggest thing that I learned have
learned in the past 70 podcasts is that I

803
00:46:19,871 --> 00:46:20,740
have a lot more to learn.

804
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,320
That's what I learned and the amount of
information out there that will help us

805
00:46:26,321 --> 00:46:29,770
get better and smarter and
more effective as humans.

806
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,710
The amount of information
is is pretty boundless.

807
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,340
And also you also see the
repetitive themes that we
see over and over again that

808
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:47,140
constantly come up and reinforce
themselves. Now with that,

809
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:52,890
I think that seeing these repetitive
themes but each with its own little angle

810
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:57,190
give have given me a better,

811
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,110
I don't want to say a
better understanding,

812
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:04,111
but I guess I don't know what other word
to use a more granular understanding of

813
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,850
of human nature and of leadership
and of war and of life.

814
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,770
Cause you get to,
nothing teaches better than an experience,

815
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:19,860
but you can't experience a
thousand years of life in reality.

816
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:25,030
But through reading and understanding
and seeing what other people have gone

817
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:29,050
through you,
you do get some level of experience.

818
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,610
I know you just went to, you
just did the, the FTX with,

819
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,510
with echelon front, you went to, did
shoot some video with life and JP.

820
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,990
And for those of you that
don't know Asheville on front,

821
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,020
we do leadership and management consulting
and sometimes we do field training

822
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:49,450
exercises where we take people out and
we teach them how to shoot and then we

823
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:53,380
teach them fundamental tactics of fire
maneuver and then we give them missions

824
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:56,190
to accomplish. And so you know, you, you,

825
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,990
I know you just went out to do your
first one and when you got back,

826
00:47:58,991 --> 00:47:59,824
you notice that you said,

827
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,820
I kind of felt a little bit of what it's
like to be in a firefight and then you

828
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:06,010
kind of backed off. He like, well,
no I didn't. I didn't, you know,

829
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:07,450
I'm not trying to say
that. And I said, no,

830
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:12,110
actually you did feel a little bit of
what it is like to be in a firefight

831
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,040
because you saw people maneuvering
and you, you were getting hit with,

832
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,170
with plastic rounds that hurt and you
knew you need to get down or you saw other

833
00:48:19,171 --> 00:48:23,070
people getting frustrated. You saw
people getting fostered. That's that is,

834
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,830
is it exactly like combat? No.
And there's also a, uh, you know,

835
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,900
the step up to real combat is huge because
now you're going to die if you screw

836
00:48:32,051 --> 00:48:36,900
up. But there is a glimpse and
there is a, there is a, uh,

837
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,950
a certain level of understanding that
you absolutely gain from those scenarios

838
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:42,784
that you're put into.

839
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,720
And it's the same thing when you read a
book and you read it the right way and

840
00:48:46,721 --> 00:48:49,150
you get gathered the information from it.
You,

841
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,710
you don't have the experience itself, but
there's no doubt you can learn from it.

842
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:56,410
So I think for me,
that's,

843
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:02,050
that's the biggest thing is really
reading with a lot of an intent to pull

844
00:49:02,291 --> 00:49:04,570
lessons out.
Seeing the multiple lessons,

845
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:06,430
seeing the different things
from different angles.

846
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:07,870
And I've talked about this before.
You know,

847
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:11,350
when you learn an arm lock from
seven different instructors,

848
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:14,410
they each teach you something a little
bit different and something that works

849
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:18,010
and some detail that you didn't see.
And then on top of that,

850
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:21,400
when you learn an arm lock from the bottom
and from the top and from the garden,

851
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:22,930
from the closed garden,
from the Open Garden,

852
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:24,340
from this cross side
and from the mountain,

853
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:28,690
you every one of those different angles
that you learn it from, you get better.

854
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:32,740
You get it. Each one of those bangles
makes you better at the other angles too.

855
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,400
So I think that's the biggest thing for
me is just learning how much I didn't

856
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:43,741
know and then taking what I can bring on
board and assimilating it into my view

857
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:47,260
and understanding,
like I said,

858
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:50,780
my view and understanding of
the world of human nature, of

859
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,010
war and of life. Yeah, it's been,

860
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,990
it's been fun for me and educational.
I agree.

861
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:04,220
I think, I mean obviously I approached
this thing from a different position,

862
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,010
but
you know,

863
00:50:07,011 --> 00:50:10,760
the no complaining thing where
people would be like no complaining.

864
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,500
I think that really got reinforced in me.
It's one of those things where,

865
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,640
what is it? Who said it? Yoda. Where he
says either do or do not. There is no try.

866
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,890
So a little bit different to
see either you'd do it. Yeah.

867
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,170
You had said that power from the star wars
series empire strikes back. Yeah. Okay.

868
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:31,160
Do or do. There is no try. Got It.
You said a lot of other cool shit.

869
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,520
But nonetheless, when um, you know,

870
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,280
when you're tasked with
something or you're, I dunno,

871
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,160
wife asks you to do something or,
or whatever,

872
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,110
you either do it or you don't do it.

873
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,790
Don't do it in complain about it
the whole time. You know where the,

874
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,450
and that's a common thing where it's a
car, I'll do it and then they'll do it.

875
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:51,320
Then they'll complain about while they're
doing it or after they do it or before

876
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:53,420
they do or before, during
and after that, you know.

877
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:56,060
So it's one of those things where, and
don't even complain in here, this is,

878
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:59,150
I'm just saying, this is what I've
kind of learned overall and it, it's,

879
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,040
it's weird because this wasn't necessarily
a specific lesson, but it's just,

880
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:09,100
it Kinda just gets incorporated into
your brain where you just kind of don't

881
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,990
even complain in your own head.
You know, you don't, when you,

882
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,210
when you dunno sweep the floor.
I don't know. You're like,

883
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,680
I can't believe I'm sweeping the floor.

884
00:51:15,681 --> 00:51:18,650
What about all this other stuff that I do
and all this stuff. Don't even do that,

885
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,190
you know? Okay. I'm tasked with just
like how you, it was, you regard it.

886
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:26,960
You compared it to um, doing paperwork
there. You're like, yeah, but yeah. Good.

887
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:30,830
You don't want to do paperwork. No,
no one wants to do paperwork. Yeah,

888
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:35,360
but you do the paperwork and you do
that. Then you crush it. As you say,

889
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:38,330
you do that paperwork the best
you can crush this paperwork.

890
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:44,840
Exactly. So man, if I got to sweep the
floor, I got to, you know, wash dishes.

891
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:46,040
They got whatever,
watch,

892
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:49,650
I'm going to do this the best I can while
in fact take pride in that you don't

893
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:53,840
take pride. Not necessarily even in
washing of the dishes. I said, yeah,

894
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,970
take pride in that,
but not necessarily just that.

895
00:51:55,971 --> 00:52:00,110
Take Pride in the fact that you're the
guy who can wash the dishes. That good.

896
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:03,320
You don't depend on me. Hell yeah,
I can do that. Give me more stuff.

897
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:04,154
I'll do it more.

898
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,240
Maybe not say that last part because
you got other things to do sometimes,

899
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:11,420
but I was saying anything you're tasked
with, do it the best you can for,

900
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:13,640
I mean that even sounds kind of
Cliche, like, Oh, I've heard that,

901
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,060
but to really have that happen,

902
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:19,820
kind of in your mind where
you regard it all your tasks,

903
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:23,130
whether you like him or not, that way
where you going to do the best you can it,

904
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:28,340
then that's a, that's a life
improving situation. Yeah. Yeah,

905
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,470
and going back to what I was taught,

906
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,620
I just thought of this while
you were talking general Mattis,

907
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:38,540
he said the other day there's an article
about him because he's extremely well

908
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:43,541
read and he has a personal
library of 7,000 books.

909
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:47,840
Very smart, very well
educated, very well read.

910
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,550
But what he said is very similar to what
I said. He said, you know, I wouldn't get,

911
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:56,870
I'm not going to get surprised because
what I'm going to face on the battlefield,

912
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,960
someone else's faced before.
And he made a couple of comparisons.

913
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:02,840
I can't think of them off the top of
my head, but you know, when I saw this,

914
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,120
when he, you know, he said, when
I saw this for the first time,

915
00:53:05,121 --> 00:53:07,160
I remembered this historical situation.

916
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:10,610
When I saw that for the first time I
remembered this historical situation.

917
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,760
So I never was surprised by what I was
seeing because I had seen it before,

918
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:18,770
maybe only in the book,

919
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,970
but at least you have a heads up
and that's what you're looking for.

920
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,850
And what's cool is if you extrapolate

921
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,280
the war,
which is what we're doing on this podcast,

922
00:53:29,281 --> 00:53:33,270
taking the war piece of
it and extrapolating the
human nature piece of it,

923
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:36,600
and that's going to give you a
broad look at the way people act,

924
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,450
the way humans act and interact.

925
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,940
And that's what I think has been
really good for me to just really,

926
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,460
the other thing is when you,
you know,

927
00:53:47,461 --> 00:53:51,630
when you teach a Jujitsu move and you
get better at it just by teaching it,

928
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,670
if you understand it more well,

929
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:58,590
for me by writing the notes and putting
them in the podcast and then thinking

930
00:53:58,591 --> 00:54:00,810
about which direction I'm going
to go and warm and talk about,

931
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:02,820
I've learned it better.
You know,

932
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,660
I've become things that used to things
that I may have known instinctively

933
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:09,450
before and done for 10 years.
Just like when we wrote extreme ownership,

934
00:54:09,451 --> 00:54:12,060
there was things in there that I said,
you know as well,

935
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:14,700
I was writing what happened. I'm
like, Oh yeah, I did it here.

936
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:16,530
I used to do it there.
This is where I learned it,

937
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:19,260
but I never really thought
about it until and,

938
00:54:19,261 --> 00:54:23,610
and even going beat before that when I
took over the training for the west coast

939
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:27,240
seal teams, I was the first time
I wrote down the laws of combat,

940
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:32,490
the four fundamental laws of combat.
Yeah. I had known those. I had,

941
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,940
I had acted that I had
performed them for years.

942
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,740
I had never written them down until I
took over training and saw platoon and

943
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:44,250
said, these guys aren't doing these things
that would make them successful. Boom.

944
00:54:44,251 --> 00:54:45,150
I wrote them down.
That was it.

945
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,110
And once I wrote them down and sort
of talk about them and show guys,

946
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:53,850
they made even more sense and I saw them
even easier when people would make a

947
00:54:53,851 --> 00:54:56,850
mistake. So it's, I think it's,

948
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:01,170
that's what's been good for me is it's
been a real great mental exercise. Yeah.

949
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:06,780
So thanks everyone for listening and
making me do this podcast once a week,

950
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,430
whether I like it or
not. And actually, yeah.

951
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:13,920
And that's another thing where,
you know,

952
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:17,630
we almost went to one
podcast every two weeks. And,

953
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,700
and so I was just talking to a buddy
of mine that's in a company that I was

954
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:26,130
talking about.
He was at one of the few guys when we,

955
00:55:26,131 --> 00:55:29,310
I kind of was thinking about
this idea of, of, you know,

956
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:33,180
go into one podcast every two
weeks and we were driving,

957
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:38,160
his name is Mike and Great Guy, great
leader, and we're driving. And I,

958
00:55:38,161 --> 00:55:41,850
and I said, hey, you know, I'm just,
we were driving to go do some work,

959
00:55:41,851 --> 00:55:44,820
was working with his company. And I said,
you know, I'm thinking about, you know,

960
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,430
maybe doing a podcast once every
two weeks instead of once a week.

961
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,600
And he was driving and I was just the
passenger and, and all of a sudden,

962
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:56,010
you know, he just Kinda, he
said, hey, you know, I just,

963
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:01,030
I, I, I don't, I don't think that's
a good idea. And also I was like,

964
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:05,460
oh my God, you know, and he was really, he
said, look, you know, you can't do that.

965
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,700
You hit a window where we
were listening to the gas,

966
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:10,070
do we expect it to come out on Wednesday?
It's got to come on a Wednesday.

967
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,450
And then he was like, okay, and he
could compromise the least is, look,

968
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,540
if you're going to do it, then you need
to, you know, you need to give us a warm,

969
00:56:15,541 --> 00:56:18,720
like a six month warning so people
can start to get used to it. And uh,

970
00:56:18,721 --> 00:56:21,570
that was one of the things that
swayed me to say, you know what?

971
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,010
I need to start to keep,
hold the line on the podcast.

972
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:27,790
That was the other thing. What?
It's hard. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

973
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,260
Hey Jocko, Mr. Sitting around saying,
hey, if it's hard to do it anyways,

974
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:35,830
and here I was, it was kind of hard, so
I was going to stick it out. No cold.

975
00:56:35,831 --> 00:56:40,720
The line, Jocko, I'm talking to you
Jocko. Practice what you preach.

976
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:42,880
You know what I mean?
Yeah. It's hard. It's hard.

977
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:45,190
You got to read a book and you
got to underline takes them. Oh,

978
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:49,310
so what do it anyways, there
it is. Bring it all right.

979
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,760
It's true.

980
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,760
Mike for the podcast continually coming
out on once a week I think plain,

981
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:02,410
but it
one of the other things,

982
00:57:02,411 --> 00:57:04,790
kind of like what you're saying
is that going to go is um,

983
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:08,200
you kind of either do it and get it done.

984
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,770
This personally in my experience,
speak from experience where you know,

985
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,020
you'll ask about about something like,
Hey, what's the status on this or that?

986
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:22,120
So it's either done or it's
not done where you can be, oh,

987
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,670
you know, I would've done that,
but you know, I did all this stuff,

988
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,500
all that stuff after you
said I would have done that.

989
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:28,060
But like that doesn't matter at all.

990
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:30,760
Either you did it or you didn't do
it either. You were like, you know,

991
00:57:30,761 --> 00:57:33,760
Kinda like how lake says you either
effective or ineffective kind of thing.

992
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,350
And the more,

993
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:40,200
and I think it's has a lot to do with
just hanging around you more where I'd

994
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:43,830
tell you about something and you'd be
like, okay, is this done or whatever,

995
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:46,630
or is this about to be done? Or where are
we on this? And then I'll say, oh yeah,

996
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:50,170
it's done. Then it's like, okay, you have
this kind of look of, okay, like solid,

997
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:53,230
like thumbs up kind of thing. But if
I say no, not yet because of this,

998
00:57:53,231 --> 00:57:53,891
right when I go into,

999
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:57,310
because you have this kind of weird haze
that goes over you, like you don't care.

1000
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,880
You're nice, you're nice.
Well, and you're not like, Woo,

1001
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,290
do you mean you're not like that at all?

1002
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:06,250
But I can see the little haze go over
you like you don't care at all about the

1003
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:09,510
DC excuses that I'm about to say
or these justifications that.

1004
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:15,130
So, and that was early on now
I just know it's automatic.

1005
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,500
It's like either the answer is yes or no,

1006
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,540
and if it's no and it
should have been done,

1007
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:22,780
then next time I see it should be done.
And that applies to everything.

1008
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:26,200
And I make the analogy where nothing of
the story where my brother would be like,

1009
00:58:26,201 --> 00:58:30,850
hey, buy me some wine. I'm like, wine, you
ever been into wine section? It's huge.

1010
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:33,520
It just give me this warning. It's
called this, it's called this, you know,

1011
00:58:33,521 --> 00:58:36,340
it's the Cabernet, I dunno,
whatever you call them.

1012
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,120
That should be like the
beef jerky section. There's,

1013
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,990
that's how big the beef jerky
section. Yeah, Bro. Yeah it
should be. But as of now,

1014
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:48,991
it's wine and if you go in there and he
wants some specific wine and it's easy

1015
00:58:49,481 --> 00:58:52,570
to go in there and be like, you know
what? This wine section is too vast.

1016
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:56,590
I'm either going to grab anyway and
I, I see and that's it. Or I'm not,

1017
00:58:56,591 --> 00:58:58,720
I'm not going to get it.
Don't task me with this big time.

1018
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:00,370
I'm just going in here
to get some letters.

1019
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:06,910
You got me treasure hunting in the wine
section. And so I'm not gonna do that.

1020
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:11,500
But I had it in my mind. I'm like, no,
you want some wine, you want this one?

1021
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:15,120
All right, well I'm going to get it. Cause
when I come home playing around, yeah,

1022
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:17,590
when I come home, either I got the
wine there, I didn't get the wine.

1023
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:20,950
And you don't want to be the guy who
didn't get the line no matter what your

1024
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,070
excuse is.

1025
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,530
I'm telling you, Bro,
apply that to everything.

1026
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,000
I apply that to something important.
You know? Jade's wine is important.

1027
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:34,670
Unimportant. Jeez. Nonetheless.
Yeah. All good things

1028
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:39,420
we got from this podcast.
I think I would concur.

1029
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:41,093
Next question,

1030
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:42,730
does the,

1031
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,310
you know what else is cool about this
podcast is people that the hearing from

1032
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:51,311
people that have done made
some awesome progress.

1033
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,600
Yeah, and that's awesome. That's,

1034
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,560
that's bad is actually the best thing
about the podcast is hearing from people

1035
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:01,940
out in the field that got promoted,
got a new job,

1036
01:00:01,941 --> 01:00:06,290
moved to leadership position,
lost 72 pounds,

1037
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:10,710
gained 12 pounds of lean
muscle mass, you know, w, w, W,

1038
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:15,440
whatever those, whatever the achievement
was. I talked to a guy the other day

1039
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,820
that that stopped a biting his nails,
right?

1040
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:25,820
Like you don't think much of it, but
he said he bit his nails for, you know,

1041
01:00:25,821 --> 01:00:30,821
34 straight gears and tried the little
nail Polish that goes on there and you

1042
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:35,450
know, you, you go to the hypnotist and
you go to all these different things. No.

1043
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,860
And you know when you don't,
when you finally said,

1044
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,680
I'm not going to bite my nails anymore,
not going to do it.

1045
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:43,640
I'm going to impose my
will switch to manual.

1046
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,630
So here in everybody that does
that kind of thing is awesome.

1047
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,320
That's definitely the most that.

1048
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,980
So I guess I'm going into not
what I learned about this,

1049
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,981
the general overall reward of the podcast
is to talk to people that have made

1050
01:00:58,911 --> 01:01:03,911
some significant progress in their life
and they attribute that progress to

1051
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,710
listen to podcasts,

1052
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:11,770
which I always re attribute when they
comment about it back to them because I

1053
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:16,310
didn't stop biting your nails at you
did. I didn't lose 72 pounds. You did.

1054
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:21,320
I didn't get promoted. You did. That's
you. That's not me. That's you. Yeah man.

1055
01:01:21,450 --> 01:01:24,290
It's,
and so it's cool that you got a little

1056
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:29,170
little little boost.
Sure. From the podcast.

1057
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:32,410
Maybe you saw something a little bit
differently. That's awesome. But you know,

1058
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:35,080
you out there in the field,
you're the one that's making it happen.

1059
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,080
We're sitting back here, maybe
providing a little cover, fire,

1060
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,880
little cover and move going on. But the,
the thing that's cool about that too is

1061
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,580
it's,
it

1062
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:49,130
proves what we talk about
on here all the time,

1063
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:53,270
which is the human will is so strong, but
sometimes people go through their life,

1064
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:54,640
they didn't know that they had it right.

1065
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,680
And so they just got to
get recognized that, hey,

1066
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:01,280
you've got this strong will that you can,

1067
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,400
you can, you can use. I was, I was,

1068
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:09,490
I was listening to an interview with
Jack Black of tenacious d and he was

1069
01:02:10,641 --> 01:02:15,641
talking about when he first discovered
that he had a good singing voice and he

1070
01:02:15,741 --> 01:02:18,950
was in high school and he tried out
for some school play and then he was

1071
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,160
supposed to sing this part

1072
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,660
and he hit that. And when he
did he, he said to himself like,

1073
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:28,620
wow, you know, I've got this
thing, I've got this Lamborghini.

1074
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:32,130
I didn't know I had this. I got this
extra gear that I can kick into.

1075
01:02:32,131 --> 01:02:35,490
And that's exactly what he says by the
way, he says, just got this extra gear.

1076
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:39,900
That's what I think
people listen to podcasts.

1077
01:02:39,901 --> 01:02:41,520
They all of a sudden realize
I've got this extra gear.

1078
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:44,130
They got this thing and that they didn't
know they had because they never had it

1079
01:02:44,131 --> 01:02:46,950
tested before. Never talked about
it. No one ever showed it to them.

1080
01:02:46,951 --> 01:02:48,570
They didn't recognize
it for whatever reason.

1081
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,800
And then all of a sudden they realize,

1082
01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:54,180
oh I got this human will that is stronger
than my weakness and I'm just going to

1083
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,880
engage it.
Watch this nail biting.

1084
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:01,180
No more jelly donuts not
happening. Yeah, getting,

1085
01:03:01,350 --> 01:03:03,610
getting out worked at work.
Not going to happen.

1086
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,420
I think it's the product cause I'm one
of those people straight up where I was

1087
01:03:09,421 --> 01:03:10,800
surprised that how much,

1088
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,760
how little actual will it took to
make these little changes, you know,

1089
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:17,610
because and, and it's good because
it does like these books and stuff.

1090
01:03:17,611 --> 01:03:20,940
It puts it into perspective where these
guys are really exercising their will

1091
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:25,410
with these crazy things. And all that
is is it is an illustration. That's it.

1092
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:29,880
That's it. It didn't even take me
hearing that to understand that,

1093
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:33,120
oh it doesn't take much wheel to do
a workout when I didn't feel like it.

1094
01:03:33,121 --> 01:03:35,670
It didn't, it didn't take that
from me to recognize it. That's,

1095
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,970
that's just an illustration. It took
me actually doing it and being like,

1096
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,310
that wasn't hard at all.
It seems hard.

1097
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:43,350
And here's another reason
why people don't realize it.

1098
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:47,010
I think I was one of those
people who didn't really,
because everywhere you look,

1099
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,630
you're always seeing like the,
the four uh,

1100
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,030
helpful tips to stop
biting your nails or the,

1101
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:56,540
for all these like external things,
you know,

1102
01:03:56,550 --> 01:03:58,840
they go into it to go to a hypnotist,
you know,

1103
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,980
go do something outside of yourself
kind of thing. Put some nasty tasting,

1104
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,410
nail Polish on your fingers so it makes
you not want to buy all this stuff where

1105
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:12,030
really all you have to do just how you
always say, oh you have to do is do it.

1106
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,190
You know, you don't, you want
to stop biting your nails. Okay,

1107
01:04:14,191 --> 01:04:17,100
stop biting your nails.
And if you really look at it like that,

1108
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,450
where like if you would have said to
me, Oh, you don't feel like working out,

1109
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:24,050
go work out. If I would have been
okay, I don't feel like working out so,

1110
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,970
so I'm going to go work out and
you just keep it that simple.

1111
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,930
That's all you gotta do. Fuck. You'd be
like, Ooh, you're done with the workout.

1112
01:04:29,931 --> 01:04:32,520
You're like, Dang, that was easy.
I'm going to do that next time.

1113
01:04:32,521 --> 01:04:36,480
You almost kind of look forward to doing
it every once in awhile because I look

1114
01:04:36,481 --> 01:04:40,110
forward to exercising your will you
like you get look forward to certain

1115
01:04:40,111 --> 01:04:43,510
workouts? Sometimes. Not always.
Right. Sometimes I'm like, oh good,

1116
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,370
I got squats today and I don't want to
do it. But sometimes you're like squats.

1117
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:52,480
Yeah, get some so you can get the same
field about about mobilizing your will.

1118
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:55,740
Yeah. It's like that. Yeah, exactly
right. That's exactly what it is.

1119
01:04:56,010 --> 01:04:59,130
That's actually one of the reasons I
was listening to a, you know Brady guys,

1120
01:04:59,131 --> 01:05:02,130
they have that, the trooper project
podcast, I was just going to one with, um,

1121
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:06,650
with our bill are either our
vulnerable April. I don't know how you,

1122
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:11,160
I just know him. I just know Israel. Yeah.
But I just know him from Twitter. Yeah.

1123
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,940
I've never heard his name pronounced,
so I don't know. Savic big beast.

1124
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:18,160
And there were just, they were
talking, um, you know what

1125
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,260
music you listened to in
the, in the, you know,

1126
01:05:20,261 --> 01:05:23,470
when you work out and
stuff to get nuts and bolt.

1127
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,770
I don't listen to any music. And
that's one of the reasons where, oh,

1128
01:05:27,771 --> 01:05:29,270
that's why I did it. I was like, Whoa,

1129
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:32,110
I'm always trying to distract
myself from the pain, you know,

1130
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,980
and let me listen to this music to get
me fired up or to make me feel good kind

1131
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:38,170
of mentally. And so I can get
through the pain of, you know,

1132
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:40,500
on an old metcons are double or whatever,
just like,

1133
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:43,120
you know what I'm going to do,
listen to no music.

1134
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:48,010
But it turns out I liked that better
now because you just feel more in touch

1135
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:52,870
with like what you're doing. Um, but Oh,
here's, uh, here's one. So I'll do a,

1136
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:55,690
what do they called?
They're kind of like front squats,

1137
01:05:55,691 --> 01:05:58,450
but you hold the two kettle
bells like this. They're like,

1138
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,190
I forget what they're called,
but um,

1139
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:05,590
so I'll do a 25 reps of 25 so it's hard.
So when you get to about 12,

1140
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:07,960
you're like, aw, you gotta, you know,

1141
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:11,320
you kind of start to hit a certain type
of wall and then when you get up to like

1142
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,290
16, 18, you're like, ah, you know,

1143
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:19,390
so what as a result of that, I would
play little numbers, games in my mind.

1144
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:22,630
So I'd count backwards from six, six,
five, four, you know what I mean?

1145
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:24,340
So you just kind of like,
why I'm approaching the end.

1146
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:28,780
It'll be done soon kind of thing. But
what I started doing it like, nope,

1147
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,380
I'm going to count them. One,
two, three, four and you'll,

1148
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,510
and in the beginning I
started to feel like, Dang,

1149
01:06:34,511 --> 01:06:36,130
when I'm getting up to 12 and I'm like,
oh my gosh,

1150
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:38,830
the pain is coming and it
comes and you're like, Dang.

1151
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:41,410
And then instead of
playing more mental games,

1152
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:44,860
like let's just count down
from here. Cause so the end
is, you know, insight, nope,

1153
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,180
I'm going to count up now.

1154
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:49,570
And when you count up the numbers going
up give you this weird mental picture.

1155
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:53,320
Like the pain is coming more now cause
you're, you're deeper into this thing.

1156
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:54,680
You know,
and it's like this,

1157
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,160
it's almost like mental abuse
you're doing to yourself.

1158
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,040
But after awhile you can
look forward to that.

1159
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:02,320
You got to look forward to
those higher numbers. You know,

1160
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:04,900
it's like bring it kind
of thing and it gets you,

1161
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:09,360
it essentially gets you even more
fired up. Yeah, that's good. Oh,

1162
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:13,620
I'm telling you, embrace
the, the pain in her gray.

1163
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:18,340
Does the inability of the average
person to defend themselves,

1164
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:21,550
make them more susceptible
to fear generally in life.

1165
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,930
And Can Jujitsu, present
Jujitsu, reduce societal fear?

1166
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:31,000
Have you, is it a pretty
obvious answer? But yeah,

1167
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:33,790
I mean obviously if you
can defend yourself,

1168
01:07:33,970 --> 01:07:38,830
it's going to give you more
confidence in the world.

1169
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,650
And if you don't know how to dissent,
defend yourself,

1170
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,040
you're going to have more fear in
the world. That's just the way it is.

1171
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:50,820
And I know that Jujitsu definitely gave
me a lot of confidence in the world

1172
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:53,880
because when you're
looking at someone you,

1173
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:57,940
you at least know you're not a
pushover at a minimum, you know,

1174
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,210
I'm not going to go out easily.
So yeah,

1175
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:04,660
I think if you don't know how
to defend yourself at all,

1176
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:07,980
I think you're definitely going to be,
but more susceptible to fear does.

1177
01:08:07,981 --> 01:08:09,490
That's kind of common sense.

1178
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:15,150
And also the the thing with not knowing

1179
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:21,320
when you don't know about things,
you, you are more scared of them.

1180
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,080
You wouldn't confrontations cause
you're on the, on the Jitsu, Matt,

1181
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:26,230
you're in competitions all the time.
And if you do an occasion, you know,

1182
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,780
occasionally you should put on boxing
gloves and boxing even strike during

1183
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:30,980
Jujitsu or you should do that stuff.

1184
01:08:30,981 --> 01:08:35,000
So you recognize what it's like to
be in a fight and then you have,

1185
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:38,540
you'll be less afraid of the
unknown because it's known.

1186
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,240
We're always afraid of the unknown.
Well now this is known. Now,

1187
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:42,074
the other thing is,

1188
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,820
the better you are with Jujitsu
and the better you are at fighting,

1189
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:51,430
the less apt, the less likely you
are to have to use it. Because,

1190
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:54,710
because people will know that you,
by the way you're acting,

1191
01:08:54,711 --> 01:08:57,230
that you're probably not person
that should be messed with.

1192
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,410
And the other thing is,

1193
01:09:00,411 --> 01:09:04,220
I think when people
actually know how to fight,

1194
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:09,140
they put up less of a
front about who they are,

1195
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:11,690
about trying to act like a tough guy.
Because I ain't man,

1196
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:14,330
I'm feeling pretty good. You know, I
ain't got no problem. Say Hi to you.

1197
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,780
I can say hi to you in the street.
Like, hey, how's it going? No big deal.

1198
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:21,410
I'm not feeling like you're going to take
advantage of me now because I know how

1199
01:09:21,411 --> 01:09:24,200
to fight. So a lot of Jiu Jitsu
guys are super nice guys, you know,

1200
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:27,230
because they're not trying to prove how
tough they are because you actually know

1201
01:09:27,231 --> 01:09:31,720
how tough they are. So I think
that's pretty obvious, you know? Uh,

1202
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:36,470
that's the, the many benefits of
Jujitsu from a personal level.

1203
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:40,600
And then as far as societal
fear, I would also say yes, it's,

1204
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,150
it's helpful because if you can handle
yourself on a personal level, right,

1205
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:49,900
then you can handle yourself in other
dynamic situations and you're more aware

1206
01:09:51,321 --> 01:09:54,560
of things and you are
better at staying calm.

1207
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:56,880
Reggie Jujitsu teaches you
how to stay calm. Well yeah,

1208
01:09:57,190 --> 01:10:00,110
you're getting a bad situation. If
you panic, you're going down. So,

1209
01:10:00,210 --> 01:10:01,970
and you get getting put bad
situations all the time.

1210
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:05,220
So you get used to it and you realize
that you needed to attach and you need to

1211
01:10:05,221 --> 01:10:08,420
do to get out of your head and can't
panic and can't get claustrophobic.

1212
01:10:08,421 --> 01:10:11,210
He used to get claustrophobic and you
don't really get claustrophobic too much

1213
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:15,920
anymore, allegedly straight up. And,

1214
01:10:15,921 --> 01:10:20,150
and also with Jujitsu and you know,

1215
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:25,010
mixed martial arts training, boxing, Moy,
Thai wrestling, you overcome adversity.

1216
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:28,400
You know, you overcome
adversity. You have to,

1217
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:34,390
and so when you know how to overcome
adversity on the mat or in the cage or in

1218
01:10:34,431 --> 01:10:37,490
the ring, that's going to help you
in real life overcome adversity.

1219
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:43,090
So I think that those are real simple
reasons why just as good if you didn't

1220
01:10:43,341 --> 01:10:45,380
think I thought Jujitsu is good.
I do think it's good.

1221
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:47,240
It's good for good for everyone,

1222
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:52,370
right update and really there's a lot
of martial arts you could put in there.

1223
01:10:52,371 --> 01:10:54,200
I'm talking about Jiu Jitsu,
but it's the same with boxing.

1224
01:10:54,201 --> 01:10:57,770
It's the same with with Muay Thai.
It's the same with wrestling.

1225
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:01,190
It's the same with judo. Sometimes I
forget to mention judo, I shouldn't.

1226
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,550
Judo is also very effective martial art,

1227
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,120
so I think all those things
are very helpful for personal,

1228
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:12,320
overcoming personal fear and giving
people confidence and their thereby

1229
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,010
overcoming societal

1230
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,800
fears as well. Yeah, it's kind
of a side note with with the,

1231
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,320
with Jujitsu forth,

1232
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:24,410
let's say in this more applies to this
concept kind of has been coming up

1233
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,310
recently where you know your
first danger get to where you,

1234
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:30,750
I think you and me and kind of

1235
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,620
our time where we started,

1236
01:11:34,621 --> 01:11:37,620
you just see we didn't look at it
in terms of like planning guard.

1237
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:42,680
I didn't even know you started Jujitsu
in 1992 I'm just saying from 92 all the

1238
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:46,890
way to about, I don't know,
I don't know the date,

1239
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:51,080
but I'm saying if you like old school
Jujitsu where use partly started unit two

1240
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,360
because of hoists. Gracie, if you're
one of these people, one of us.

1241
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:57,260
That's why I started just doing hoists.
Gracie won UFC one,

1242
01:11:57,370 --> 01:12:00,720
you know where we looked at Jujitsu as,
okay,

1243
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:03,150
if I get in a fight with someone I
want to be able to win the fight.

1244
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,130
Even if he's bigger than me.
It wasn't because,

1245
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,350
oh I want to be the next world champion,
you know,

1246
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:12,400
concerned about how to effectively hold,
you know, the most points on buddy. Yeah.

1247
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:15,870
Or when I pulled guard, like the coolest
like flip move, I can do it, whatever.

1248
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,940
And I'm not saying like that's
what it is and I'm not saying that,

1249
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:22,620
but there that is in the game now.
So sometimes as a result of this,

1250
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:25,560
sometimes you can go with no Jujitsu
experience. You don't know about twice,

1251
01:12:25,561 --> 01:12:27,270
Gracie necessarily. You haven't, you know,

1252
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:31,170
that isn't what compelled you to learn
Jujitsu. You just hear great things like,

1253
01:12:31,171 --> 01:12:35,700
you know, from Dako or whoever and you're
like, Hey, I want to go learn Jujitsu.

1254
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,430
This is the best fighting thing
according to Jack. I'm going to go see,

1255
01:12:38,431 --> 01:12:39,264
I'm going to go see what up.

1256
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:43,620
And then they go in there and then let's
say the first day they'll learn, um,

1257
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,980
you know, just an arm lock
from the bottom or you know,

1258
01:12:46,981 --> 01:12:51,210
something that if you don't go in with
the full context of what Jujitsu is,

1259
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,960
it won't translate. You know, you, you'll
learn a move and you'd be like, wait,

1260
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:58,710
how am I going to go in a fight now? You
know, it's like, cool, that's a cool move.

1261
01:12:58,711 --> 01:13:00,750
It's kind of like, you know what guy?
Hey, let me show you when you're a kid,

1262
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:03,480
let me show you this finger lock.
And you're like, that's cool,

1263
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:06,030
but how are you going to get my
finger? Yeah, exactly. You know,

1264
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:08,290
like all this stuff just
doesn't apply to US fight. So,

1265
01:13:08,291 --> 01:13:11,340
so just to answer your question,
I just did a little like tiny, uh,

1266
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:16,440
instructional thing for some people
that hadn't trained before and it was a

1267
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:20,190
support, a charity. And so
it's all good. But you know,

1268
01:13:20,191 --> 01:13:23,250
these people never done [inaudible]
before and I taught them, you know,

1269
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:28,260
the amount escape, right. And
immediately, you know, one of the guys,

1270
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,350
hey, you know what happens when they do
this because he's doing this right here.

1271
01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:35,340
Yup. Okay. So bring it back in
everyone. And it basically, you know,

1272
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:37,440
after this happened a couple times I said,
here's the deal.

1273
01:13:37,470 --> 01:13:39,690
I'm teaching you a new language.
Yeah.

1274
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,860
So far I've taught you the
word thug. Right? Right.

1275
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:47,160
That's the only word I've taught you
thought. Yeah. I haven't even taught you.

1276
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:51,450
I cause that would,
that would be a context of self awareness,

1277
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:56,280
which you don't have. We don't have,
you only know VA. That's it. That's it.

1278
01:13:56,281 --> 01:13:58,530
That's all you know. And
actually I shouldn't have
been you. I should have said,

1279
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,040
I just talked to you.
The word purple. Yeah.

1280
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:05,330
Because you can't though actually
can apply to different things. Right.

1281
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:09,720
This when you just learn one
thing, it's, it's not meaningless,

1282
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,160
but it's only, it's almost like
if walk into a foreign country

1283
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:17,180
and the only word you knew
how to say was purple. Yeah.

1284
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:21,570
And their language, it's not going to get
you very far at all. Right? It's not. No.

1285
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:22,840
And that's the same thing.

1286
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:26,560
So you're right in the context
of like a singular move.

1287
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:29,440
Jujitsu is worthless right now.

1288
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:34,210
Backburnered when I learned five moves
and knew of the rear naked, choke the arm,

1289
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:37,000
walk the Camino and no
one else knew anything.

1290
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,840
W when you can say five different words
in a world where no one can speak,

1291
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:44,500
you have power.

1292
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:47,650
And that's the way it used to be and how
it's not like that anymore. Everybody,

1293
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:50,710
everybody watches UFC. Everybody
watches UFC. And so the,

1294
01:14:50,711 --> 01:14:53,440
everyone's seen an arm lock before.
Everyone's seen a rear naked choke.

1295
01:14:53,441 --> 01:14:56,410
They didn't. You can watch a rear naked
choke and see that's a simple move.

1296
01:14:56,411 --> 01:15:00,610
You can see how you put that on somebody.
So yes you are correct.

1297
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,350
But if you got it,

1298
01:15:02,351 --> 01:15:05,350
you got to do more than just the
context of like a singular move.

1299
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:06,970
Cause that's what I'm going
to be very useful to you.

1300
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:08,920
Yeah. So when you, um, all right,

1301
01:15:08,970 --> 01:15:12,200
I remember watching you a fee and there
was a guy who had commentate, right?

1302
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:14,690
Kind of a nerdy guy, but
he, he kind of knew a,

1303
01:15:14,691 --> 01:15:17,430
apparently he took Jujitsu so he would
kind of call it, he'd be like, okay,

1304
01:15:17,431 --> 01:15:20,760
so now who crazy. He wants to get
on top right now, stop his position.

1305
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,060
He can't give to take down. So now he's
pulling guard kind of thing and then,

1306
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:28,000
or he'll be like, okay, he's establishing
position with a mouse and he's going to,

1307
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:30,570
he's going to punch him until he turns
over and then he's going to choke him and

1308
01:15:30,571 --> 01:15:33,150
he's calling it any does it.
Right. So I remember thinking,

1309
01:15:33,151 --> 01:15:36,720
okay that mount position,
very, very powerful.

1310
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:40,470
Or if he's on the bottom, you want guard
kind of thing, you can see, you know,

1311
01:15:40,471 --> 01:15:45,060
cause he kind of explained.
So when I first started
Jujitsu, like an actual class,

1312
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:48,060
I knew what guard was.
I knew what mount was.

1313
01:15:48,061 --> 01:15:51,540
I knew those positions and why they're
important, where you know, like if you're,

1314
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,470
if someone's mounted on you were hoists,

1315
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:54,900
Gracie would always be
mounted on the person.

1316
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:56,280
It's like it's really hard to get out.

1317
01:15:56,281 --> 01:16:00,300
He's going to struggle and end if you
turn over your even worst situation,

1318
01:16:00,301 --> 01:16:01,530
you know?
So I kinda knew that.

1319
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:06,240
So I knew the actual context and a lot
of people when they go into just to just

1320
01:16:06,241 --> 01:16:08,580
because they hear about how cool
it is, they don't have that, that,

1321
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:11,640
that foundation going in. So
I think, man, I think that,

1322
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:17,070
I dunno if they'd ask for it or what.
But I think when, when, when instructors,

1323
01:16:17,071 --> 01:16:20,800
when a new person, a brand new person
don't know these zero days of Jujitsu,

1324
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,130
if they teach that like this
is the amount, this is why
it's important, you know,

1325
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,270
just like how you did at the muster
where you're like, you know, I can hit,

1326
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:30,390
you can hit just like that.
And then that'll provide content.

1327
01:16:30,391 --> 01:16:34,500
And then at the end how you taught a move
submission or whatever. Then it's like,

1328
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:38,670
okay, in this is one of the many
things you can do. And it's like, oh,

1329
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:43,590
and by the way, when I say many
infinite, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. So yeah,

1330
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:44,880
I think that if you,

1331
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:49,380
and I guess this goes out to like anyone
who goes into their Jujitsu class and

1332
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:49,990
learned,

1333
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:53,790
it just happened to be on the day where
you learn like some kind of arbitrary

1334
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:58,320
move. Given the fact that you don't know
the foundation it with the foundation,

1335
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,830
any move is going to make a lot more
sense as long as you have that foundation

1336
01:17:01,831 --> 01:17:04,980
and the importance of the importance
of guard that worked until you know all

1337
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:09,000
these other things. Of course we all want
to learn the submission. What's cool,

1338
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:10,010
the mission,
who can I get

1339
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:14,480
this guy in? Who wants to fight this guy?
Yeah. Another thing that people ask is,

1340
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:17,780
you know, will he keeps pulling
my hand away. I go, yeah,

1341
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:21,860
it's a fight fighting another person.
It's not just who's not magic. I saved.

1342
01:17:21,861 --> 01:17:25,250
You did some magic, but it's not magic.
It's not magic. It's an actual fight.

1343
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,400
The person is going to resist.
You have to have moves. I didn't,

1344
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:32,420
it doesn't turn into magic
until you have it all together.

1345
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,320
Then that turns into magic and then
you bestow it upon someone who does it.

1346
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:40,850
You know? It is like magic man.
He's this little guy, George,

1347
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:45,530
he's a purple belt and I
was white belt and man he's,

1348
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:49,630
he's the one who taught me butterfly
guard. He was small too. And he would,

1349
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:53,060
he'd be flying me around doing butterfly
guard sweeps and like straight arm

1350
01:17:53,061 --> 01:17:56,870
locks and stuff like from the bottom like,
Bro, what is this guy doing? Magic. Yeah.

1351
01:17:56,871 --> 01:17:58,730
And one time he's like
someone out while we're,

1352
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:01,780
you know how like when you're rolling
you can kind of talk to people while

1353
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:02,541
you're rolling.
You know,

1354
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:04,760
especially if you're rolling with
a guy who has advanced as well,

1355
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,040
because you don't have to focus on
what you're doing kind of thing.

1356
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:11,300
So this was an introduction of that
concept where I'm rolling with George,

1357
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:15,260
he's carrying on a conversation with
his inappropriate. Do those weekend.

1358
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,710
It wasn't that it was someone was
asking him like, Hey, like how do you,

1359
01:18:18,711 --> 01:18:20,180
how did you do that kind of thing.
He was like,

1360
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,150
well this is what he's doing and while
we're rolling he's kind of commentating

1361
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:25,490
his rolling and he's like, so,
and this sets up the suite,

1362
01:18:25,491 --> 01:18:28,730
which I'm about to get them with an it
and he gets me with the sweep and well

1363
01:18:28,731 --> 01:18:30,170
that's the small,
that's why it is.

1364
01:18:30,171 --> 01:18:35,171
That's why it is kind of magic magic
because if I could make this coin

1365
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:42,300
disappear, if I could actually do
that, that would be magic. Yeah.

1366
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:47,450
If I can take your arm against your
will and straighten it out and there's

1367
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:51,080
nothing you can do to stop it.
Yeah. It's kind of magic is to

1368
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:55,490
say, I mean that is what
magic is though. Right?

1369
01:18:55,491 --> 01:18:59,360
When when you make make it here, it's
like illusion. Right. Were you a makeup?

1370
01:18:59,361 --> 01:19:03,740
I'm not talking about, I'm talking
about actual, yeah. Actual magic. Yeah.

1371
01:19:03,741 --> 01:19:04,590
No such thing.

1372
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:12,200
But it does seem that way when they don't
know when they don't know how you did

1373
01:19:12,201 --> 01:19:16,850
that. Again, he had it, you know
what I mean? Like similar to that,

1374
01:19:16,851 --> 01:19:17,661
making the coin disappear,

1375
01:19:17,661 --> 01:19:22,661
but it really just went behind knuckle
or whatever possible you buy 50 pounds.

1376
01:19:23,950 --> 01:19:28,000
Let me see how you did that.
Yeah, watch this. Do it again.
Do it again. Do it to me.

1377
01:19:28,001 --> 01:19:32,120
Get it to the
next question.

1378
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,760
Hi Jocko.
I've been listening to your,

1379
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:37,160
to you ever since I first
heard you with Tim Ferris.

1380
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,760
I've been considering
Jujitsu. Same thing. Yeah.

1381
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:44,630
Ever since hearing you guys talk
about it so passionately, however,

1382
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:49,550
I've had a shoulder. I've
had sold shoulder surgery,
liberal tear in the past,

1383
01:19:49,610 --> 01:19:54,610
and some issues with bicep tendinitis
and I'm worried that grappling sport,

1384
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:58,190
that grappling support might
make me prone to injury. Again,

1385
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:00,200
would you recommend Jujitsu
for someone like me?

1386
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:05,050
Thanks in advance for taking the
time and providing your headlight.

1387
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:08,070
So there's another form of Jujitsu,
actually a

1388
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,630
that I don't talk about very much,

1389
01:20:09,631 --> 01:20:11,880
but it's definitely a feasible
thing for a situation like this.

1390
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:15,810
And that's the learning Jujitsu,
right? Learning, Jujitsu,

1391
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,840
learning the moves,
drilling them,

1392
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:23,930
gaining the understanding of how they all
fit together and then only sparring in

1393
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:26,520
like a really controlled environment.

1394
01:20:26,590 --> 01:20:31,590
And by that I mean highly
skilled instructor that isn't
going to hurt you or let

1395
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:36,810
you get hurt doing something stupid
and that will provide you with enough

1396
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:38,250
resistance so that you know,

1397
01:20:38,251 --> 01:20:43,251
moves are going to work but not taking
it to fall on level 27 you know,

1398
01:20:43,921 --> 01:20:45,330
blood bath battle.

1399
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:50,250
And unfortunately this situation
is kind of is very likely,

1400
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,140
and I've seen this before,
I'm sure you have too,

1401
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:55,500
where you get somebody that maybe
they had an injury or maybe there are,

1402
01:20:55,860 --> 01:21:00,450
they are in some job where they can't
get hurt, you know? Oh, right, right.

1403
01:21:00,450 --> 01:21:04,500
And surgeon or an older
person that doesn't want to
get hurt because they're in

1404
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:06,960
the middle. So I've seen
this, people do this before.

1405
01:21:06,961 --> 01:21:08,640
What they do is they
basically take Jujitsu,

1406
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:12,600
they take private Jujitsu classes and may
only role with the instructor and they

1407
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,600
learn moves and they learn
how to put together. That's,

1408
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:20,410
that's one way to do it is
you just find a good, now you,

1409
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:21,900
I've heard nightmare
stories about this too,

1410
01:21:21,930 --> 01:21:24,870
where the Jujitsu instructor
feels the need to prove himself,

1411
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:28,380
which is just pathetic.
There's no way.

1412
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:31,680
When you go in and you tell them
instructor, Hey, I've got a bad shoulder,

1413
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,620
I've got a bad knee, I've got a bad
neck, I've got a bad back. Whatever.

1414
01:21:34,621 --> 01:21:36,630
You tell them and you
say, look, I just want it.

1415
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,620
I just want to learn the techniques and,
and,

1416
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:42,900
and learn how to apply them in a very
fundamental way. I'm not here to compete.

1417
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,820
I have no ego and I don't
want to prove anything.

1418
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,770
I just want to be more knowledgeable.
The Gi,

1419
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:51,170
Jujitsu instructor should be more than
happy to take you on board and, and,

1420
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,070
and let this, you know, do this.

1421
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,610
You can also do it if you,
I mean,

1422
01:21:56,611 --> 01:21:58,920
cause Jujitsu private
instruction is very expensive.

1423
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,320
You can also do it in a group setting,

1424
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:06,410
but what you have to do is you have to
keep your ego completely in check unlike

1425
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:12,960
anything you've ever tried before.
Because every idiot, and by every idiot,

1426
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:15,930
I mean every human being on earth,
all of them.

1427
01:22:16,830 --> 01:22:18,210
You take that person.

1428
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:22,680
If I take a person that weighs 145 pounds,

1429
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:28,380
who's never trained any Jujitsu
or wrestling before, and I say,

1430
01:22:28,381 --> 01:22:31,110
okay, you know, you want me
to teach you to, to here,

1431
01:22:31,111 --> 01:22:36,060
I'm going to put this arm lock on you
and I take their arm and I say, okay,

1432
01:22:36,061 --> 01:22:39,000
so this is what it feels like when you
get arm unlocked. Their instinct is, well,

1433
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:41,040
how are you going to get my arm there?
You won't be able to do that.

1434
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:44,580
And they're gonna fight it. They're going
to fight it, always going to fight it.

1435
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,860
So everyone's ego gets involved.

1436
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:52,140
So you have to just completely put your
ego in check because you think, oh,

1437
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,490
I'm going to roll with this guy over here,

1438
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:55,860
but I'm have to come a little bit
stronger than we'll cover and you just get

1439
01:22:55,861 --> 01:22:59,130
hurt. That's how you get
hurt now, especially if you
have preexisting injuries.

1440
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,690
So you have to do that.

1441
01:23:00,691 --> 01:23:03,390
You have to find the right
training partners that are
completely mellow and have

1442
01:23:03,391 --> 01:23:06,790
nothing to prove and are very relaxed and,
and experienced in Jujitsu.

1443
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:09,490
So if they do catch something that's
going to be a little bit awkward.

1444
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:14,290
Oh yeah man, I'll just let you go. No
big deal, no big deal at all. And, and,

1445
01:23:14,291 --> 01:23:19,120
and you do that and then you slowly,
very slowly escalate over time.

1446
01:23:19,121 --> 01:23:20,970
Once you know and understand Jujitsu,

1447
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:25,300
you start to go a little bit harder still
keeping your ego in check and all that.

1448
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:26,860
Now if you do that,

1449
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,800
you should be able to get
into Jujitsu over Amada. Dr,

1450
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:34,000
I don't know the condition
of your label tear,

1451
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:38,200
so I don't have the authority or the,

1452
01:23:38,830 --> 01:23:43,240
or the what,
the proper credentials,

1453
01:23:43,241 --> 01:23:46,570
credentials to,
to give you the go ahead.

1454
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:50,980
But if you do what I just said,
there's, you should be. Okay.

1455
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,320
Now the problem is that it's
hard to do what I just said.

1456
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:57,040
It's hard for everybody cause everybody's
competitive and Jujitsu's a very

1457
01:23:57,041 --> 01:24:00,460
competitive thing. And when I say
competitive, it's mentally competitive.

1458
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,320
It just makes you think,
I want to know, want to,

1459
01:24:02,630 --> 01:24:04,990
I have these guys in the other
day, these guys are, you know,

1460
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,860
the senior executives learning Jujitsu
for the first time, didn't know anything.

1461
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:14,100
And I taught them, you know how I taught
him the open, the elbows scape to,

1462
01:24:14,101 --> 01:24:14,934
to escape them out.

1463
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:19,180
I told them to go through them like
just to practice the move on each other.

1464
01:24:19,570 --> 01:24:21,670
They do,
they do for six minutes of it,

1465
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:24,130
they come back or calling back in the
middle of there sweating. And you know,

1466
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:29,370
some of the pairs are sweating because
they were having a level seven battle and

1467
01:24:30,460 --> 01:24:31,001
those,

1468
01:24:31,001 --> 01:24:36,001
and these were again 45 50 55
year old executive type people.

1469
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:41,470
But you try and teach them to move
and they want to fight, you know,

1470
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:47,090
so that's what you got to be careful
of and you know, you don't want to get,

1471
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,840
you know, you don't want to worse your
injuries, you don't want to do other,

1472
01:24:49,930 --> 01:24:52,090
you want to have other sports impacted.
You know,

1473
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:57,091
you might enjoy surfing or
whatever playing another sport,

1474
01:24:57,641 --> 01:25:01,630
basketball and you ruin it and now
you can't play cause you did Jujitsu.

1475
01:25:01,631 --> 01:25:02,770
I don't want that to happen to you,

1476
01:25:03,130 --> 01:25:08,020
but you can do Jiu Jitsu in a controlled
way that you shouldn't need to get hurt,

1477
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:11,990
but you need to keep your
damn ego in check. Great.

1478
01:25:13,290 --> 01:25:17,040
Yeah. And another thing that
that seems obvious I think,

1479
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:21,740
but apparently is not as obvious. Like you
know how you have, you know, labels are,

1480
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:24,780
especially if you had
surgery, I've had said, yeah,

1481
01:25:24,781 --> 01:25:28,170
if you had surgery and bicep tendinitis
and these are all things that like if

1482
01:25:28,171 --> 01:25:29,970
you do a,
yeah,

1483
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,270
okay you got to do a separate
program but you do Rehab,

1484
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:37,620
you'll improve that we're, and that's
really the main thing with these injuries.

1485
01:25:37,621 --> 01:25:40,410
You know how people will there have back
or their shoulder stuff that they get

1486
01:25:40,411 --> 01:25:43,260
surgery, they get it fixed and
then, but it's still, you know what,

1487
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:45,750
you're just going to have that for the
rest of your life kind of thing. Bro.

1488
01:25:45,751 --> 01:25:48,990
If you focus on rehab,
like it's a straight up workout where,

1489
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:52,350
I mean don't push it because
that's not what rehab is, rehab it.

1490
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:56,460
But you focus on that. Like it's an
actual program. Like I've workout program,

1491
01:25:56,461 --> 01:25:58,740
take it seriously. Um, but you can,

1492
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,260
a lot of times you can get
rid of these things fully.

1493
01:26:01,261 --> 01:26:04,100
Especially like a tendonitis,
bicep tendon. I like,

1494
01:26:04,101 --> 01:26:07,470
I had surgery on my bicep straight up,
torn off the bone surgery.

1495
01:26:07,471 --> 01:26:09,290
So of course I'm going to
be prone to tendinitis.

1496
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:13,310
But you just mean you've got to treat it
like it's like that's another thing of

1497
01:26:13,311 --> 01:26:16,970
your body that you got to develop, you
know. Got Folks not tendinitis, you know.

1498
01:26:17,510 --> 01:26:20,990
So man,
I would recommend that big time where,

1499
01:26:20,991 --> 01:26:22,920
and you'll be more compelled to do it.
When you find a,

1500
01:26:22,921 --> 01:26:24,440
how fun did you do to is
and you're like shoot,

1501
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:28,700
I could be getting after it rolling way
better if my shoulder like just felt

1502
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:31,910
better.
And then you go do some extra stuff,

1503
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:35,200
like all these little rotator movements
for your shoulder cause it's shoulder to

1504
01:26:35,540 --> 01:26:38,090
sarge. Like during the
demonstration, you know,

1505
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:41,870
starting to gets nuts sometimes doing
a demonstration pulls my shoulder out,

1506
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:45,800
which was kind of hurt from like the
day before from remember Ryan Gillespie?

1507
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:49,490
Oh yeah. Yeah. So he hurt my shoulder
than sarge heard it the next day. Anyway,

1508
01:26:49,491 --> 01:26:51,290
so let's Jack couldn't
do any pressing whatever,

1509
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,390
do those little bent like you
use those rubber band things. Uh,

1510
01:26:55,490 --> 01:26:58,280
and I would use the cables at
the gym at 24 fitness and men,

1511
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:02,090
it brings it back and tendonitis,
same thing.

1512
01:27:02,091 --> 01:27:06,170
You can get therapy and stuff like that.
Do that men and it'll help it.

1513
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,850
So if you didn't do any kind of rehab
and then you just jump into Jujitsu,

1514
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:13,700
it's like, yeah, you're going to be way
more prone. And you know the, the, the

1515
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:17,020
disclaimer here is like,
it's Jujitsu,

1516
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,290
it's a contact sport and
you're going to get twisted up.

1517
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:24,490
And if you're scared of getting
twisted up and you are a,

1518
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:28,780
you know,
concert pianist or you're a surgeon,

1519
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:32,380
you need to accept the
fact that this is the,

1520
01:27:32,381 --> 01:27:36,490
this is a full contact sport and you
can definitely get hurt, you know,

1521
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:39,880
and we have, we have, we have
an actual surgery and you know,

1522
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:41,890
we've got several doctors,

1523
01:27:41,891 --> 01:27:45,760
but we have an actual
hand surgeon and you know,

1524
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:50,230
Doctor Luke trains [inaudible] Nogi does
it all full speed and full all the time.

1525
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:55,060
Black belt by the way. Yeah. Black belt by
the way. MMA fighter too. But, but yeah,

1526
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:58,090
he knows the risks. He's cautious.
He takes his finger, you know,

1527
01:27:58,091 --> 01:27:59,850
he just take the precautions,

1528
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:04,450
you take the precautions and then you
accept that there is a level of risk.

1529
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,820
You know,
I trained for 20 whatever,

1530
01:28:06,821 --> 01:28:11,800
five years and I hurt my
finger, you know, like whatever.

1531
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:15,540
A couple of weeks ago. Dang. And I
just heard another finger, they don't,

1532
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:19,000
these things happen.
So what are you going to do?

1533
01:28:19,870 --> 01:28:22,900
You're going to not train. That's
a, that's a, that's a possible,

1534
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,840
it's kind of an option I guess.
Yeah. It's kind of an option,

1535
01:28:25,841 --> 01:28:30,841
but you can train in a method that you
are a lot less likely to get hurt and you

1536
01:28:32,021 --> 01:28:35,740
can go so far in the spectrum
of not getting hurt that you,

1537
01:28:35,770 --> 01:28:40,420
that you could really get that possibly
getting hurt to an absolute minimum.

1538
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:41,850
And that's what I say.

1539
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,470
If you're training with a black belt
instructor and you're just doing privates

1540
01:28:44,471 --> 01:28:46,120
and you guys have a
really good understanding,

1541
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:48,750
your chance of getting hurt
a pretty small, yeah, yeah.

1542
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:56,470
But yeah, if you, if you let
that keep you from doing it,

1543
01:28:56,471 --> 01:28:58,330
I think you're doing
yourself more harm than good.

1544
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:00,910
And that goes for anything really.
It's like Dang,

1545
01:29:00,911 --> 01:29:02,430
if have to go to the post office,

1546
01:29:02,431 --> 01:29:05,730
but you're scared of the statistics
of car crashes and you can,

1547
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:08,760
so we can do not go to the post office.
Right? You got to mail that thing,

1548
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:10,530
you know,
you got to get it done.

1549
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:15,270
True. Next question. You've got to mail
that thing. I go or whatever. You know,

1550
01:29:15,510 --> 01:29:16,800
whatever the case may be.

1551
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:22,510
When you're stepping into a leadership
role and you have someone on your staff

1552
01:29:22,511 --> 01:29:23,860
who's not a team player,

1553
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:29,170
creates clicks goes over me and straight
to my bosses when there's a problem and

1554
01:29:31,091 --> 01:29:31,924
whenever he went,

1555
01:29:32,170 --> 01:29:35,890
whenever has concerns voices them
among teammates and not directly to me.

1556
01:29:36,130 --> 01:29:37,990
How do I continue in my role?

1557
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:41,470
How do I assess myself
and how do I tackle this?

1558
01:29:42,620 --> 01:29:45,470
Biggest thing we got to do is build in a
relationship with that person. You know,

1559
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:47,890
you got to get in that person's head,
you got to find out what's going on,

1560
01:29:47,891 --> 01:29:50,530
you got to find out, you
gotta, you gotta talk to him.

1561
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,570
You got to build that relationship.

1562
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:55,270
You got to talk to him about why
they're going over your head. You then,

1563
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,770
then you know what?
When they say,

1564
01:29:56,771 --> 01:29:59,380
well I'm going over your head because this
happens. You Go, oh, I didn't know that.

1565
01:29:59,650 --> 01:30:00,760
You don't,
I'm going to get that fixed.

1566
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:04,030
And you build up a little trust and
then they say some other problems.

1567
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:08,740
You get that one fixed and then you
say, hey man, you know it's, you know,

1568
01:30:08,741 --> 01:30:13,090
it's kind of hurts the team is when
you're telling the team things that are

1569
01:30:13,091 --> 01:30:17,760
negative and if we could work together to,
you know,

1570
01:30:17,770 --> 01:30:21,220
you tell me what's going on, it's
negative and then we solved the problem.

1571
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:22,930
We're going to do better as a team.
And that's,

1572
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,580
that's my goal is just
to do better as a team.

1573
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:29,680
And I see that you're a leader because
people listened to you and when you start

1574
01:30:29,681 --> 01:30:30,610
saying negative things,

1575
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:35,140
they start thinking negatively cause
you just influential person and, and I,

1576
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:38,350
and the influence you have over people,
something that is going to be,

1577
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,700
can be very beneficial to what
we're doing. If you want it to be,

1578
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:47,800
I want you to want it to be, but you
know, I'm not you. You have that I don't.

1579
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:50,740
So let's work.

1580
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:55,390
If you could help me move this in a
positive direction so our team can be more

1581
01:30:55,391 --> 01:31:00,090
successful. That's the kind
of thing I would do here. And,

1582
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:03,820
and the other thing is, you
know, ask them straight up, hey,

1583
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:08,440
what am I doing wrong as leader? What
can I do better? Where can I become?

1584
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:10,450
Where can I make more things happen?

1585
01:31:10,451 --> 01:31:12,760
So that way and what you're doing
is you're letting down your guard,

1586
01:31:12,761 --> 01:31:15,370
you're letting them give
him the opportunity to
hopefully be honest with you

1587
01:31:15,371 --> 01:31:19,840
about what you're doing wrong. And
then you can give them, you know,

1588
01:31:19,841 --> 01:31:20,890
you can correct those measures.

1589
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:24,730
Now there is a possibility that this
person is jerk. And when you say,

1590
01:31:24,731 --> 01:31:26,230
what am I doing wrong?
They go back and say, hey,

1591
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,630
this guys even know what he's doing.
He's just so,

1592
01:31:28,631 --> 01:31:33,631
that's why you need to take it slowly
and feel the situation out in and make an

1593
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:37,360
assessment of how they're going to react
to these things and build a little bit

1594
01:31:37,361 --> 01:31:41,050
of a little bit of leadership capital
with that person before you go and say,

1595
01:31:41,051 --> 01:31:43,420
Hey, what am I screwing up?
Because then it's like, Yo, dude,

1596
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:46,570
Jocko doesn't even know what he's doing.
He's asking me what he should be doing.

1597
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,050
So don't, if the person is a jerk,
you have to watch out for that.

1598
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:51,700
So that's what we're going to
build a relationship first.

1599
01:31:54,530 --> 01:31:59,530
It's like building a relationship
seems like a very common theme,

1600
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:04,300
far stretching solution. It
is very much so. Uh, you know,

1601
01:32:04,301 --> 01:32:09,301
you take the extreme example of I'm a
hostage taker and you're my hostage and

1602
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:14,170
I'm threatening to kill you.
What are you supposed to do?

1603
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:17,080
Build a relationship with me.
You want to get me to see you as a human.

1604
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,080
That's what we're talking about. The
same thing. That's an extreme example,

1605
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:23,110
but this is the same thing going on here.
It's a really dumped,

1606
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:26,980
by the way I heard this with story on
the news, I forget how old the girl was.

1607
01:32:26,990 --> 01:32:29,710
He was a kid though,
a girl kid and she'd,

1608
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:33,610
all she did was Blab to this guy who
kidnapped her and he wound up letting her

1609
01:32:33,611 --> 01:32:35,460
go. There you go. Cause she,

1610
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:39,790
she built that relationship with this
team member that's creating clicks and

1611
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:42,190
doing all this negative stuff. It's
because he doesn't know you, you know?

1612
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:45,490
And he's, he's just going, I don't know.
You know, chocolate is a mystery to me.

1613
01:32:45,491 --> 01:32:48,870
He doesn't hang out. I don't
know. I ease, he's bad. Don't die.

1614
01:32:49,190 --> 01:32:52,690
He just v there's a separation. Yeah.
So I'm going to close that separation.

1615
01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:53,980
I'm going to Blab to them.

1616
01:32:53,981 --> 01:32:58,310
I'm going to build a relationship and
we're gonna let that little kid go. Yeah,

1617
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:00,580
yeah.
I remember

1618
01:33:00,930 --> 01:33:04,830
the nightclub where, you know, you have
different bosses, different managers,

1619
01:33:04,831 --> 01:33:08,010
they work different shifts or whatever.
So one guy,

1620
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:13,830
his name is Matt Gilmore, tall, tall
guy. I love that guy. He was a real,

1621
01:33:13,831 --> 01:33:17,040
I don't know, for whatever. He's like,
I should, I could just relate to him.

1622
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:19,220
You know,
he was just real nice and I don't,

1623
01:33:19,221 --> 01:33:22,620
another way he talked was kinda not
funny like a comedian, but just kind of,

1624
01:33:22,621 --> 01:33:25,560
you know, some people when they talk
it's just kind of entertaining, you know,

1625
01:33:25,770 --> 01:33:26,460
every time,

1626
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:29,160
every once in a while they'll use certain
words that's just kind of unique to

1627
01:33:29,161 --> 01:33:33,690
them. It's like, oh, I like that. Anyway,
really liked him. And so I was hoping,

1628
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:36,600
and he would usually work on
Friday, Saturdays, right? He was,

1629
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:39,690
he was kind of high up.
And then there's other guy,

1630
01:33:40,070 --> 01:33:42,990
I'm not going to say his name nonetheless.
There's this other guy and this guy,

1631
01:33:42,991 --> 01:33:47,270
he was like the full on kind where
he had this air about them where he,

1632
01:33:47,370 --> 01:33:50,340
I'm the manager of this
club kind of thing.

1633
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:53,880
And on off times if he'd be at like a
party or something that we were cruising

1634
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:57,210
or whatever and he'd talk
about how, yeah, you know,

1635
01:33:57,211 --> 01:34:01,350
I'm in the office doing
these sexual things with this
person and just, you know,

1636
01:34:01,351 --> 01:34:04,350
real, real douchey for lack of better
term, real douchey kind of guy.

1637
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:09,210
And one time he was, um, there was
this rule lawn as long time ago.

1638
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:10,950
There's this rule,
you can't go upstairs.

1639
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:13,990
There was like three levels in this club,
so you can't go upstairs.

1640
01:34:13,991 --> 01:34:17,430
It's like this high end kind of lounge.
You can't wear jeans upstairs.

1641
01:34:17,850 --> 01:34:20,490
There's a dress code. I had
been to that. Yeah, no, no.

1642
01:34:20,491 --> 01:34:23,800
You would not be welcome for
flops and shorts or no, no.

1643
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,600
You won't even get in the
front though apparently. Um,

1644
01:34:26,601 --> 01:34:29,610
so one day on my off night I had jeans on.

1645
01:34:29,611 --> 01:34:33,300
I went upstairs real quick just to talk
to one of my friends cake nuts and cause

1646
01:34:33,301 --> 01:34:36,330
he was up there and so was talking
to him and this guy, this manager,

1647
01:34:36,331 --> 01:34:39,960
that one I didn't like, he was up there
and he'd be like, he was like, Hey,

1648
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:44,360
the rules apply to everyone, you know,
go downstairs. So I'm like, ah, you know,

1649
01:34:44,361 --> 01:34:46,620
I'm just, I will, I'm just going
to talk to him. And he's like,

1650
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:49,860
the rules apply to everyone. Go
downstairs like not be nice about it off.

1651
01:34:49,861 --> 01:34:52,200
I'm like, all right, whatever. That's
just an example of one experience.

1652
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:57,800
The next week he comes in on his night
genes upstairs or whatever and as a joke,

1653
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:05,210
not being a dick as a joke, I was like,
hey, you have jeans on. I was working.

1654
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,540
And he's like, he goes, he's all, yeah,

1655
01:35:08,541 --> 01:35:11,570
well my title has a bit more
letters than yours does.

1656
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:16,010
That's what he said to me.
So

1657
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:17,560
I'm not sure where we're going with this.

1658
01:35:17,561 --> 01:35:21,500
I know that I was gonna say that's an
example of him not building a relationship

1659
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:22,334
with me.

1660
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:26,900
Matt Gilmer wouldn't have said that.

1661
01:35:26,990 --> 01:35:28,820
No,
he would us either not,

1662
01:35:28,821 --> 01:35:32,570
he would either compromised with me
the first night or he would have,

1663
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:36,860
he would have laughed at my
joke and be like, ha ha, good
point. Whatever. Or both.

1664
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:37,940
He probably would have done both.

1665
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,940
Still friends with Matt Gilbert by
the way. Um, okay. Next question.

1666
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:45,710
In light of recent events,

1667
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:50,840
what is the best course of action
when confronted by an obvious abusive

1668
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:55,340
authority resulting in personal injury
due to an innocent person to an innocent

1669
01:35:55,341 --> 01:35:59,810
person. Oh, tune in to an innocent person
that that occurs in one's presence.

1670
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:05,810
At what point is it acceptable to
physically engage with the assailant even

1671
01:36:05,811 --> 01:36:10,020
though the assailant has some
kind of authority? Sorry,
that's two questions. What,

1672
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:14,600
what's the, um, recent
event event? Is the,

1673
01:36:15,420 --> 01:36:20,090
the person on the airplane getting
dragged off an insured because the,

1674
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:24,240
it was over. Yeah.
Yeah. Overbooked flight.

1675
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,220
So W,
n you know,

1676
01:36:26,221 --> 01:36:30,540
obviously I guess you could put more
recent events is you know, if you,

1677
01:36:30,570 --> 01:36:34,650
if you could have a police
officer that's doing something,

1678
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:37,290
you could have a bouncer.
You know,

1679
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:41,220
I'm sure you have plenty of stories
about your night club days besides just

1680
01:36:41,221 --> 01:36:44,790
wearing jeans in the wrong area,
which you know, has a big violation.

1681
01:36:45,370 --> 01:36:49,920
But so, so here's what, here's what,
here's my answer to this. What do you do?

1682
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:51,960
You're one of those things happen.
First of all,

1683
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:55,550
the people that are in the situation are
wrapped up in the situation. They're,

1684
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:56,580
they're emotionally,

1685
01:36:56,581 --> 01:36:59,760
mentally wrapped up in a situation
to situation has escalated.

1686
01:36:59,761 --> 01:37:04,380
They're caught in a storm
and you're not in the storm.

1687
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:06,030
You're outside the storm.
So what do most people do?

1688
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:10,890
And they see that storm going on. What
do most people do? Tell me. Panic. No,

1689
01:37:10,891 --> 01:37:14,390
they pull out their I phones and
they start recording situation.

1690
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:18,510
That's what they do. That's what everyone
does. Hey, oh, there's a fight going on.

1691
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:20,850
Worldstar let's do you
know what I'm saying?

1692
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,970
I'm impressed that you know about world.
Well,

1693
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:27,840
they have a lot of good fights on
there, which you have to watch. So yeah.

1694
01:37:27,841 --> 01:37:30,000
Well cause you learn from,
you see the way people act,

1695
01:37:30,001 --> 01:37:33,990
you see some human nature in, in
videos. So that's what people do.

1696
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:38,010
So what you actually want to do instead
of pulling out your video is you want to

1697
01:37:38,011 --> 01:37:40,470
try and get them out of that moment.
Emotionally.

1698
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:45,360
You want to talk to them like a normal
person, engage with them. You know, hey,

1699
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:49,290
hey sir, you need to calm down.
That's just a police officer.

1700
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:51,390
He doesn't mean any harm. Hey, hey,

1701
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:55,770
you know officer that that guy's not
a threat to you. Right. You know,

1702
01:37:55,771 --> 01:37:58,500
just take a step back. It looks
like he's trying to relax. You know,

1703
01:37:58,501 --> 01:38:00,090
you want to talk them,
disengage them,

1704
01:38:00,091 --> 01:38:03,380
getting their heads out of
those bad scenarios. Yeah.

1705
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,950
And you'll be in a calm voice. Say some
things, like I said, say something.

1706
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:12,060
Hey officer, there's a lot of people that
are videoing this right now. You know,

1707
01:38:12,061 --> 01:38:15,150
just a lot of people saw what
happened. So let's, it's, it's,

1708
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,490
you don't have to do anything else.
Let's,

1709
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:22,200
let's get this person under control. I
can give you a hand or whatever, you know,

1710
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:25,250
you just want to you and,
and of course, what are the,

1711
01:38:25,260 --> 01:38:28,830
what is their initial reaction to be back
at you but just back away or you don't

1712
01:38:28,831 --> 01:38:33,400
shut up your, you know, you
don't know. And, and so you
need to absorb that, right?

1713
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:37,620
Say, Hey, look, I'm not, I'm not
giving you any threats at all.

1714
01:38:37,621 --> 01:38:39,840
I'm just here to help out.
I don't want to see any trouble.

1715
01:38:39,841 --> 01:38:41,130
Don't want you to get in trouble.

1716
01:38:41,370 --> 01:38:46,370
You just want to talk to people and get
them to get them out of that emotional

1717
01:38:47,011 --> 01:38:50,100
storm that they're in both sides,
both sides,

1718
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:54,390
because it's a really nasty situation.
You know, when you don't listen to me,

1719
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:57,360
when I start to hurt you, when
I grabbed your, your risk,

1720
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:02,040
let's say like one of those like, uh,
police pain, compliance type moves,

1721
01:39:02,130 --> 01:39:06,000
I grabbed your wrist and I start
to twist it. You as a human being,

1722
01:39:07,770 --> 01:39:11,700
the natural instinct it, some people
might have the instinct to comply,

1723
01:39:11,701 --> 01:39:13,980
but a lot of people have the instinct
of you grabbed me and start hurting me,

1724
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:17,160
I'm going to pull away. Okay, you're
resisting now you're resisting.

1725
01:39:17,161 --> 01:39:19,290
So what I need to do,
I need to go harder with a harder I go,

1726
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:21,680
the more you resist and you
see where this is going.

1727
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:25,520
Next thing you know I'm beating you in
the head cause I don't know how to use a

1728
01:39:25,530 --> 01:39:30,360
show called unfortunately because in
some areas choke holds are illegal.

1729
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:36,270
So again, as the outsider, you
want to pull them out of that.

1730
01:39:36,271 --> 01:39:37,410
You want to talk to them,

1731
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:42,440
you want to get them to see that outside
of the emotional storm that they're in

1732
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:46,410
both sides.
Both sides are an emotional storm,

1733
01:39:48,210 --> 01:39:53,190
physical intervention, you know, now we
are talking like this is a serious step.

1734
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:57,220
You start stepping into these
scenarios. You don't, you know,

1735
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:59,250
you want to be very,

1736
01:39:59,251 --> 01:40:02,220
very careful about stepping into
these one of these situations.

1737
01:40:02,640 --> 01:40:05,670
And even that physical
escalation should be,

1738
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:09,990
or physical intervention should
be just with the sole purpose of,

1739
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:15,120
of deescalating, right? You're not
walking over and grabbing a guy know,

1740
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:20,130
hey, you know, it's like a hand on the
shoulder. Hey Sir a officer, hey you know,

1741
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:24,150
TSA agent or whoever you are,
hey let's just calm down.

1742
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:26,890
You want me to give you a hand getting
this person under control. You know,

1743
01:40:27,330 --> 01:40:31,380
you don't want to get these people to
where now you become because as soon as

1744
01:40:31,381 --> 01:40:34,680
you do that you just ended a storm.
You part of the storm.

1745
01:40:34,681 --> 01:40:39,360
Now even though you're trying not to be,
you're, you're, you're entering the storm.

1746
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,770
So you got to be very, very cautious
about what you're doing there.

1747
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:45,620
And you know,

1748
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,900
what would I do in a situation where
I saw someone getting beat to death,

1749
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,560
you know, I'm going to
do what I said, you know,

1750
01:40:53,561 --> 01:40:56,260
now might I go a little bit further cause
I have a lot of experience and maybe I

1751
01:40:56,261 --> 01:41:00,700
can handle this situation. And deescalated
physically. Yeah. And you know,

1752
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:05,230
you see this sometimes where something
we escalating an innocent civilians will

1753
01:41:05,231 --> 01:41:09,270
come and help, uh, on officer
secure person. So those,

1754
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:13,900
there's ways to do it. You just gotta be
very, very cautious when you do those,

1755
01:41:13,960 --> 01:41:18,940
when you do that. Because the other piece
of this is in any, again, you see us on,

1756
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,810
on Youtube, you don't know what
happened to get to this point.

1757
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:26,200
You don't know who that person
is, who the perpetrator is, right.

1758
01:41:26,201 --> 01:41:29,590
The perpetrator might look
totally innocent but you
don't know any background.

1759
01:41:29,591 --> 01:41:31,060
So when you start stepping in there,

1760
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:34,480
you might be stepping in there to defend
a person that just shot a person or a

1761
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:35,740
person that just,
you know,

1762
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:40,210
got caught doing something or a person
that really did resist the cops hard and

1763
01:41:40,211 --> 01:41:43,960
do, do some damage. So
I don't, I don't know.

1764
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:47,970
And I'm generally going to side with
a, with a police officer, right?

1765
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,560
I mean the police officer,
I'm, I'm respecting that they,

1766
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:54,130
that they're doing the right thing and
sort of step in there and start making

1767
01:41:54,131 --> 01:41:57,950
something happen is not going to
generally work out in a good way. Um,

1768
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:02,020
maybe you can help them get
the perpetrator under control,

1769
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:04,210
but um, yeah. To,

1770
01:42:04,211 --> 01:42:08,590
to make the assumption that because a
cop has escalated to a point of violence

1771
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:13,270
that the cop is an out of control. Crazy
cop. It's, but not an accurate assumption.

1772
01:42:13,900 --> 01:42:18,250
Most likely. That's the wrong
assumption. Yeah. You know,

1773
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:22,390
cops are not walking around waiting
to, to, to beat the crap out of people.

1774
01:42:22,391 --> 01:42:24,940
That's not what they're doing. They
don't want to do that when it happens.

1775
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,960
It's something,
something has generally led up to it.

1776
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:31,360
When we see it in a case
that isn't like that.

1777
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:35,340
That's why we see it because
it's now news is now news. Yeah.

1778
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:40,030
So be very, very careful
about that. Again, you know,

1779
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:43,300
most of the time, you know, just
try and deescalate it verbally.

1780
01:42:43,301 --> 01:42:44,590
Ask if they need any assistance.

1781
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,590
Ask if you can call nine one one form
and get more assistance for them.

1782
01:42:47,591 --> 01:42:51,520
Ask if they need any help, talk to them,
you know, do that, take that approach.

1783
01:42:51,730 --> 01:42:55,630
If you have to physically intervene,
especially if you have some experience,

1784
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,570
you know, let them know what
you're doing. Do you need any help?

1785
01:42:58,571 --> 01:42:59,980
Do you need any assistance?
That type of thing.

1786
01:42:59,981 --> 01:43:01,240
And I'm sure we'll get some feedback from,

1787
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:06,310
from some cops on this one
and it'll be good. Yeah. Yeah.

1788
01:43:06,311 --> 01:43:10,370
I feel it when I was back to the balance,
her situation when guys would,

1789
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:13,060
you know,
a fight would break out.

1790
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:16,630
So in a club when a fight break breaks
out is more chaotic than, you know,

1791
01:43:16,631 --> 01:43:18,250
in the street when you
see two guys fighting.

1792
01:43:18,430 --> 01:43:23,080
So it's a little bit more dangerous when
you jump into the fight to try to break

1793
01:43:23,081 --> 01:43:26,380
it up. Because if you just
jump in and grab the guy,

1794
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:29,080
the guy doesn't know if you're trying
to break up the fight or if you're for

1795
01:43:29,081 --> 01:43:31,420
sure you're just another
attacker. Yeah, exactly right.

1796
01:43:31,421 --> 01:43:33,620
So he's gonna start swinging or whatever.
Um,

1797
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:38,080
and that's not to mention any of that
guy's friends who sees you do that in the

1798
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:41,050
dark. You know all this, you know,
the dark nightclub lights, whatever.

1799
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:43,950
So he might hit you, whatever. And
then, you know, bottles can be,

1800
01:43:44,110 --> 01:43:46,120
it can be dangerous.

1801
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:50,080
So if you jump in there with,

1802
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:54,970
before you even touch the person,
you, you're already saying break it.

1803
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:59,300
What I would always say is either break
it up or, or calm down. I calm down guys,

1804
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:02,180
break it up, break it up before you
even touch them. And they hear that.

1805
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:05,270
So when they feel you, they don't feel
a punched. Got It. It's like calm down,

1806
01:44:05,271 --> 01:44:09,130
calm down, and they feel you kind
of, it's more of a light given, uh,

1807
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:11,660
compared to the, the guy who he's
fighting with. Is that a punch?

1808
01:44:11,661 --> 01:44:13,380
It's not a wrestling moves,
nothing like that.

1809
01:44:13,381 --> 01:44:16,550
It's like you're breaking it up and
you just gave me a good reminder too.

1810
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:19,100
If you're on the outside and you
see something like this going on,

1811
01:44:19,130 --> 01:44:21,410
like if you're on that plane,
you see this, this, uh,

1812
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:25,580
this passenger getting roughed
up. Hey, hey, hey passenger.

1813
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:28,790
Just calm down. Do what they're
telling you to do. Just do what?

1814
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:32,000
They're just comply with what they're
doing to do, you know, just relax.

1815
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:35,560
Let them cough. You just relax. You
know, you can take, uh, you know,

1816
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:39,230
I definitely heard a
cop say this actually,

1817
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:41,300
I heard the guy that was
on Sam Harris podcasts.

1818
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:44,930
Like if you want to got an issue with what
a cops doing to bring it to the court,

1819
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:46,250
let your lawyers handle it.

1820
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,070
Don't handle it right there
because you're going to lose,

1821
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:51,230
you're going to lose that situation.
You're going to end up hurt.

1822
01:44:51,231 --> 01:44:54,320
You're gonna end up injured. It's gonna
be a bad scenario. Yeah. So same thing.

1823
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:58,920
Tell them, tell, you know,
if you see someone getting,
getting roughed up, then hey,

1824
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:01,760
hey man, we're all watching. Just comply.

1825
01:45:01,761 --> 01:45:05,630
Just do what they're telling you to
do and take it up with a lawyer later.

1826
01:45:05,631 --> 01:45:10,340
Just try and get that person to calm
down. Cause that's, you know, chances are,

1827
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:13,070
you know, the police
officer, he's arrested,

1828
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:16,550
thousands of people put his
hands on thousands of people.

1829
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:21,230
That person that's getting roughed up,
they haven't, they've not been arrested.

1830
01:45:22,010 --> 01:45:25,490
I can guarantee you that the United
passenger probably never been arrested in

1831
01:45:25,491 --> 01:45:29,660
his life. So here he is. And like
I said, you start to pull me,

1832
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:33,020
I'm going to resist. I don't want people
don't pull me know, but don't pull me.

1833
01:45:33,021 --> 01:45:36,710
But now all of a sudden we got an incident
going on. So if someone's saying, hey,

1834
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,220
listen, just listen to what they're
telling you. You need to just calm down.

1835
01:45:40,221 --> 01:45:42,230
You don't want this to get any worse.
That type of thing.

1836
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:44,720
Talk to people and get them
to detach a little bit.

1837
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:47,180
And obviously the United situation isn't,

1838
01:45:47,210 --> 01:45:50,060
isn't this real linear
situation where it's like, hey,

1839
01:45:50,061 --> 01:45:53,360
that's the passenger's fault. He should've
just went with them. Kind of. I mean,

1840
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:56,510
there's honestly all I know about,

1841
01:45:56,511 --> 01:46:00,410
I don't know anything about it other
than I saw the guy getting dragged out of

1842
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:00,980
the plant.
That's what,

1843
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:03,470
that's the only part I saw a guy getting
dragged out of the plane and I saw the

1844
01:46:03,471 --> 01:46:06,260
good Gracie Gracie
breakdown of out of habit.

1845
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:10,640
How to defend yourself in that situation.
Yeah. And uh, he was, uh, he was,

1846
01:46:11,910 --> 01:46:16,100
it's just a long story. Who's there
was that does apply, you know,

1847
01:46:16,101 --> 01:46:20,630
if you're getting arrested or, or,
or taken off the plane or whatever,

1848
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:23,990
and you choose to fight for your
rights right then and there, the amen.

1849
01:46:24,020 --> 01:46:26,840
That's a battle that you're going
to, you got to do that, you know,

1850
01:46:26,841 --> 01:46:30,320
and there's consequences to that. When
you mean you got to do that. It's like,

1851
01:46:30,321 --> 01:46:32,360
can you give her the expression?
If you want to be a gangster,

1852
01:46:32,361 --> 01:46:36,350
you got to do gangster stuff. Okay. It's
actually a gangster shit, but, but, but,

1853
01:46:36,380 --> 01:46:40,190
but you're not, you're not advising.
I'm saying if you want that beef,

1854
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:45,050
then you're going to get that.
Yeah. So, so yeah. Do it.

1855
01:46:45,051 --> 01:46:47,120
But like I said,
especially with like the cops,

1856
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:49,230
if they're arresting you and you're
like, hey, you violated my rights,

1857
01:46:49,231 --> 01:46:49,980
so I'm going to fight you

1858
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,090
right now for my rights. Yeah.
If you want that beef, okay.

1859
01:46:54,091 --> 01:46:57,870
But it's, you're going to be more,
you're gonna be safer, first off,

1860
01:46:57,871 --> 01:47:02,790
and more effective if you fight for your
rights administratively later. Yeah. And,

1861
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:07,840
um, so nonetheless, a kind of
on a tangent there, but um,

1862
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:12,210
the, Oh, the Co, uh, when you're
helping the cops or whatever,

1863
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:14,520
it's the same way as if you're a bouncer.

1864
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:16,710
You kind of identify
yourself kind of thing.

1865
01:47:16,711 --> 01:47:21,690
Just like how you were saying
and it is easy I think to,

1866
01:47:21,691 --> 01:47:24,480
and they call it availability
bias, right? It's easy to be like,

1867
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:26,370
all of these cops are beating this guy up.

1868
01:47:26,610 --> 01:47:30,780
And I see this on youtube all the time
where the cops just beat up these guys,

1869
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,000
you know,
so these are bad cops or whatever.

1870
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:38,100
But it's like anything where when you
say how you say it made the news because

1871
01:47:38,101 --> 01:47:40,910
it's this bad cop situation,
it's in your mind, you know,

1872
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:43,530
all the good cops and like legit RF,
all that.

1873
01:47:43,630 --> 01:47:46,770
They're not on your new millions if
they're not on youtube. Yeah, exactly.

1874
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:50,130
And even if they were,
that doesn't stick in your mind.

1875
01:47:50,520 --> 01:47:52,200
Lady views businesses.
Usually

1876
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:56,750
the video of a police officer
doing his job. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1877
01:47:56,751 --> 01:47:58,930
No one wants to watch that.
They want to see somebody screwing up

1878
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:02,850
and they forget about it. It's totally not
in their mind. So yeah, anything screw,

1879
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:03,430
you know,

1880
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:06,400
being screwed up or anything that just
has this emotional impact on their mind,

1881
01:48:06,401 --> 01:48:09,070
they're going to think he's like
way more common than it really is.

1882
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:13,270
So I think it's important to
kind of keep that in mind always.

1883
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:14,673
Absolutely.

1884
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:17,873
Next question,

1885
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:23,910
if you have a subordinate that hasn't
improved after talks and instruction but

1886
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:26,760
can't, but you can't fire
them because of the union,

1887
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:29,623
what do you do?

1888
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:33,650
I'm going to find something that they're
good at and I'm going to get them to

1889
01:48:33,651 --> 01:48:36,860
focus on that. And um,
you know, as a leader,

1890
01:48:36,861 --> 01:48:40,490
that's what you're trying to do as a
leader. You got to make your team members,

1891
01:48:40,491 --> 01:48:41,480
if you've got team members that you,

1892
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:44,270
that you can't get rid
of for whatever reason,

1893
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:47,000
and they're not quite doing
what they should be doing,

1894
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:50,540
or they're not up to speed, what can they
do? What can they offer to the theme?

1895
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:52,340
When I find out what you
can offer to the team,

1896
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:55,220
I'm going to have you focus on
that. It's the way it is. If there,

1897
01:48:55,221 --> 01:48:58,250
if that causes some kind of disruption.
Because you know,

1898
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:03,460
echo can only move 10 bricks a day and
everyone else is moving 200 and so now

1899
01:49:04,431 --> 01:49:08,330
everyone's all mad cause echo is not
working, not carrying his load. Well,

1900
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:09,740
I'm in a, you know, well number one,

1901
01:49:09,741 --> 01:49:12,710
I'm gonna look for a job for him where
he's no one sees him carrying not

1902
01:49:12,711 --> 01:49:14,720
carrying bricks, right?
Hey, instead of doing that,

1903
01:49:14,721 --> 01:49:17,360
you're going to organize the bricks
over here. You're going to count,

1904
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:19,250
you're going to count
Brex cause your week.

1905
01:49:19,670 --> 01:49:21,660
So you're going to be the brick counter.
So that's what gonna do.

1906
01:49:21,661 --> 01:49:23,810
I'm just going to change it up and to
find out what they can do. That's what,

1907
01:49:23,811 --> 01:49:25,760
that's what you have to do as leader.
And by the way,

1908
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:29,420
I'm not going to give up on them. I might
not, I might not invest a ton of time,

1909
01:49:29,421 --> 01:49:31,010
but I'm gonna keep saying, hey, you know,

1910
01:49:31,011 --> 01:49:32,960
if you want to move from
counting bricks to move and is,

1911
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:35,330
which got to do and here's what you
gotta do, you gotta keep working.

1912
01:49:35,331 --> 01:49:38,990
You've got to keep getting stronger to
work on your dead lift work when you know,

1913
01:49:38,991 --> 01:49:43,130
get a little bit stronger so you can
carry more bricks. So it's, you know,

1914
01:49:43,131 --> 01:49:44,960
when that happens,
it doesn't just happen because of unions.

1915
01:49:44,961 --> 01:49:48,190
It happens for all different of that.
In the military you can't,

1916
01:49:48,230 --> 01:49:53,020
you get a guy that he's
in a situation where,

1917
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:55,960
yeah, he's not going to get, we're not
going to let him go. Yeah. You know,

1918
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:59,440
we've got to keep x amount
of people in country. Okay,

1919
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:02,020
so this guy's one of the people in
country we were not allowed to get rid of.

1920
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:06,160
Okay, cool. Well what can you
do? Maybe you can count bricks.

1921
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:08,530
They know what happened. Can, would
be the best brick counter we got.

1922
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,553
Yeah.

1923
01:50:11,620 --> 01:50:14,350
You might have to do a little
isolation too. You know what I mean?

1924
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:17,440
You might have to isolate them a little
bit again because you don't want people

1925
01:50:17,441 --> 01:50:22,340
thinking, Oh, echoes over there, you know,
in the air condition and he doesn't do,

1926
01:50:22,341 --> 01:50:25,650
do and carry his load and so that can
cause problems. Yeah. And chocolate.

1927
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:28,060
Just letting it happen because I
was letting it happen, you know?

1928
01:50:28,061 --> 01:50:31,030
So you might have, you got to,
you got to figure this out.

1929
01:50:31,031 --> 01:50:33,460
How do you isolate them a little bit?
How you make sure that they're working,

1930
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:36,400
you know, maybe you can only count
brexitpreneur of you working more hours,

1931
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:36,791
you know,

1932
01:50:36,791 --> 01:50:40,480
or doing some other thing to make up
for your slack in the brick clearing

1933
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:41,950
category.
Yeah.

1934
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:44,913
Interesting.

1935
01:50:45,600 --> 01:50:48,240
Bottom line,
as a leader,

1936
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:53,300
when you get somebody that doesn't quite
do what they need to do and you can't

1937
01:50:53,731 --> 01:50:57,540
get rid of them, find out what they
can do and take advantage of it,

1938
01:50:57,570 --> 01:51:00,590
using it to the best of
their ability for supporting

1939
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:04,540
deep. It kind of seems like, I
mean given what you just said that,

1940
01:51:04,630 --> 01:51:07,000
I mean this might dumb it down too much,

1941
01:51:07,001 --> 01:51:11,560
but it's a situation where you are
making the best of it. Right? Exactly.

1942
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:14,950
And what I found in life,

1943
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,010
when you make the best of something
you don't get plagued with,

1944
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,980
because let's say the two scenarios,
one, you're making the best of it too.

1945
01:51:20,981 --> 01:51:24,370
You're not. So when you're not,
it's going to be burdening.

1946
01:51:24,430 --> 01:51:27,070
Burdening you everyday
echoes only moving 10 brick.

1947
01:51:27,071 --> 01:51:29,620
That's gonna bother me every day.
It doesn't have to do, by the way,

1948
01:51:29,740 --> 01:51:31,420
you're still gonna move
the same amount of bricks.

1949
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:34,660
We're going to get the same amount of
work done, 10 bricks, a hundred bucks,

1950
01:51:34,661 --> 01:51:36,610
200 bucks, whatever. But meanwhile,

1951
01:51:36,611 --> 01:51:40,120
you're getting tortured all day because
you're that the fact that echoes not

1952
01:51:40,121 --> 01:51:42,460
moving as many breaks or he's in
the air conditioned room, whatever,

1953
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,720
that's bothering me every single day.

1954
01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:47,200
But if you understand that we're
making the best of this situation,

1955
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:49,330
that's not going to bother you. You
know, we're making the best of it, right?

1956
01:51:50,020 --> 01:51:51,460
It's the best situation.

1957
01:51:51,630 --> 01:51:54,930
Very true, better attitude, you know,

1958
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:58,500
make the best of the sitch.
Next question.

1959
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:03,640
Ego is the enemy.
It can you take that too far?

1960
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:07,960
I can joke about myself
all day and be okay,

1961
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:12,100
but also I don't want coworkers
not to take me seriously.

1962
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:15,420
Is there,
that's actually kind of two questions.

1963
01:52:15,450 --> 01:52:18,630
It's talking about ego and they're
talking about joking around, right, right.

1964
01:52:18,631 --> 01:52:21,720
Those are, those are two different things.
A little bit like self deprecating.

1965
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:24,330
Yeah.
And so can you,

1966
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:30,090
can you be too humble and put your ego
in so much? Check that it hurts you?

1967
01:52:30,091 --> 01:52:34,380
Yes. Actually you can't. Hmm.
You know. Hey, echo, how's
it going? I'm in charge. Um,

1968
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:37,590
I'm really horrible at that Shit. I just
don't know what I'm doing right now.

1969
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:41,190
That's not good. You know, it's like I
said to the, the Marine lieutenant, right.

1970
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:46,220
Am I telling him to go and into
check in and say, Hey, I, you know,

1971
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:48,980
I just don't, I just got here.
Just got out of the basic school.

1972
01:52:48,981 --> 01:52:52,510
I don't know anything. Really. Yeah.
Do you want to follow that guy? No,

1973
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:56,600
that's the one I'm talking about suits.
Oh, can you be overly humble? Yes.

1974
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:59,540
Like I said, it's okay to admit
that you don't know everything,

1975
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:01,700
but that doesn't mean
don't be well prepared.

1976
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:05,690
That doesn't mean don't be confident
that you can figure things out.

1977
01:53:05,691 --> 01:53:08,930
That doesn't mean you can't
ask good questions. Right.

1978
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:14,020
It doesn't mean that you don't report
in without knowing the nomenclature and

1979
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:19,280
the fundamentals. Right. That's going
to, you know, hey, Jocko just checked in,

1980
01:53:19,281 --> 01:53:22,640
but he knows what our mission's been.
He knows what our mission statement is.

1981
01:53:22,760 --> 01:53:26,160
He knows how our basic processes,
he already looked at all that.

1982
01:53:26,180 --> 01:53:30,230
He knows everyone's name. Yeah,
I'm prepared. I'm prepared.

1983
01:53:31,250 --> 01:53:33,110
So that's what you want to be.

1984
01:53:33,200 --> 01:53:37,400
That's not saying I have no idea what
I'm doing right now. I just got here. No,

1985
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:43,190
no, that's not what we're talking
about. So don't be overly humble.

1986
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:45,020
Most people,

1987
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:49,460
the reason I talk about the other one of
be humble all the time is because most

1988
01:53:49,461 --> 01:53:52,550
people tend towards letting
their ego be inflated.

1989
01:53:52,580 --> 01:53:56,780
That's what most people tend towards.
So I tend to talk more about, hey,

1990
01:53:56,781 --> 01:53:58,820
keep your ego in check
when you weren't checking.

1991
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:01,670
Because most people that are so
scared of looking bad, they say, well,

1992
01:54:01,671 --> 01:54:03,980
I know how to do this.
It never seen it before.

1993
01:54:03,981 --> 01:54:06,770
I know how to do that and it never seen
it before. You're going to look stupid.

1994
01:54:07,190 --> 01:54:10,520
Hey guys,
I've been put in charge of this.

1995
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:12,170
I know you guys have
been doing it for awhile.

1996
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:15,500
Looking forward to learning from you
and how you execute it and and driving

1997
01:54:15,501 --> 01:54:19,490
forward and keeping kicking ass in this
mission. Does anyone get mad at that? No.

1998
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:24,170
That's a lot different than hey guys,
I have no idea what's happening.

1999
01:54:24,950 --> 01:54:29,660
That's too much. Yeah. So
don't go there and be humble,

2000
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,260
but not, not passive.
Put your ego in check,

2001
01:54:33,261 --> 01:54:38,020
but don't turn into a
baby. Work the day. Uh,

2002
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:42,290
the second part of this, this question
about joking around too much and that's,

2003
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:42,801
you know,

2004
01:54:42,801 --> 01:54:46,970
that's different from too much ego and
absolutely you can joke around too much.

2005
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:49,880
Now of course.
And we've talked about this,

2006
01:54:49,881 --> 01:54:54,080
a good team and a good leader.
They're having fun,

2007
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:56,810
they're having fun with everything that
you're doing. And I always had fun.

2008
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,980
I always had fun. I still have
fun all the time. I'm having fun.

2009
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:04,700
But if all you do is
joke around all the time,

2010
01:55:04,701 --> 01:55:06,620
but then when it comes time
for the joke to be over,

2011
01:55:06,621 --> 01:55:09,890
people won't take you seriously. So
that will be problematic. You know,

2012
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:14,480
I had a rule that was no
joking on the radios. Right?

2013
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:18,020
So if you were on a radio,
you weren't allowed to take make jokes.

2014
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:20,440
No joking on the radio.
And what's cool about that?

2015
01:55:20,441 --> 01:55:23,450
Cause you know and tasking a bruiser.
When I was a platoon commander,

2016
01:55:23,451 --> 01:55:27,200
when I was assistant to the commander,
we had fallen all the time. We laughed,

2017
01:55:27,201 --> 01:55:30,980
we joked, we had a blast with everything
we did. No joking on the radio.

2018
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:35,060
You see what I'm saying? Yeah. That
was a law. No joking on the radio.

2019
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:39,260
And what was good about it
was as I think back to that,

2020
01:55:39,261 --> 01:55:43,890
what that translated to was we're not
joking around in the field and that

2021
01:55:43,891 --> 01:55:46,020
expanded, look, when we're
briefing, we're not joking around.

2022
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:49,650
It was a very clear distinction.
Of course.

2023
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:52,500
Did people have we did things happen
out in the field sometimes we're like,

2024
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:56,670
oh my God, this is hilarious. Of
course that happened, but the general,

2025
01:55:56,790 --> 01:56:01,440
99% of the time, 95% of the time
was, hey, we're in the field.

2026
01:56:01,441 --> 01:56:05,850
We're working. We are serious. That's the
priority. Did we have fun in the field?

2027
01:56:05,850 --> 01:56:07,470
Yes. Did I laugh in the field? Yes.

2028
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:12,240
But the priority and this
norm was we are going,

2029
01:56:12,241 --> 01:56:14,190
we are serious and we're,
that's the priority.

2030
01:56:14,430 --> 01:56:19,080
So don't joke so much that you

2031
01:56:20,910 --> 01:56:24,810
don't get taken seriously. One time
I was with a senior ranking officer,

2032
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:27,090
a flag officer,
meaning an officer with stars,

2033
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:31,830
and we went to go brief.
I wasn't attached to this unit,

2034
01:56:31,831 --> 01:56:35,940
but then when they went to go brief this
unit or we went to go receive a brief

2035
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:40,260
from a unit and in the brief,
in a power point side,

2036
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:45,710
these guys had put a slide in
that was an inappropriate slide.

2037
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:50,700
And it was a crude joke and it was really
funny. I thought it was really funny,

2038
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:53,470
you know, I was like, oh, that's pretty
funny that these guys did that. Y'All did.

2039
01:56:53,490 --> 01:56:57,670
I saw the slide. They had it up there
and it was completely inappropriate and,

2040
01:56:57,671 --> 01:56:59,940
and, and vulgar. Right.
That's what it was.

2041
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:03,570
They didn't know this general at all.

2042
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:08,660
And he was a very straitlaced guy and
didn't appreciate that kind of humor.

2043
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,060
And they, they, they, they
had like the welcome slide.

2044
01:57:12,061 --> 01:57:15,300
The next slide that came up was
this inappropriate vulgar slide.

2045
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:19,320
What was it was, it was, it was,

2046
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:23,430
it was, it was inappropriate.
I'll leave it at that.

2047
01:57:24,270 --> 01:57:26,460
And,
and you know,

2048
01:57:26,461 --> 01:57:31,050
it was like there was a chuckle in the
room and at the same time there was

2049
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:35,430
nothing but silence in the room. You
could feel the discomfort. And, and,

2050
01:57:35,431 --> 01:57:36,720
and since like I said,

2051
01:57:36,721 --> 01:57:40,200
I thought it was funny and I knew
it wasn't going to go over well.

2052
01:57:40,201 --> 01:57:43,050
As soon as I saw us,
Ooh, this is not good.

2053
01:57:43,770 --> 01:57:46,620
And the reason I'm telling this big long
story, it's cause I have another rule.

2054
01:57:47,130 --> 01:57:51,720
Don't put jokes into your
slides in PowerPoint,

2055
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,210
no jokes because you can,

2056
01:57:54,211 --> 01:57:58,020
you can articulate the joke cause you can
feel the room out and see what's going

2057
01:57:58,021 --> 01:58:02,760
on. You can get it. Get a
taste. You can get a feel for
them if you, if you walk in,

2058
01:58:02,761 --> 01:58:06,450
if they would've had a chance, if I could
have said freeze the first slides up.

2059
01:58:06,630 --> 01:58:09,900
You, you've met the general
here for for five minutes,

2060
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:12,420
do you want to remove that side?
They'd be like, oh absolutely.

2061
01:58:12,421 --> 01:58:14,640
Let's get it out of that. Because they
could see that he was a serious guy and,

2062
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:18,180
and not, you know, one to be that that
wants to be seen. That kind of thing.

2063
01:58:18,181 --> 01:58:21,060
It didn't take, wasn't hard.
Who's pretty easy book to read,

2064
01:58:22,260 --> 01:58:24,870
but you don't have that
opportunity. There was no, hold on.

2065
01:58:24,871 --> 01:58:29,820
We're going to delete this slide. Nope.
There it was. Boom. Welcome. It was the,

2066
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:34,170
it was after the slide of, you know, this
is where we are was the welcome slide.

2067
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:39,720
And I said, Ooh. So it's no joke,
you know, on the radio, no joking.

2068
01:58:39,721 --> 01:58:44,590
And your slides keep your slides
clean and, and the, the risk benefit.

2069
01:58:44,980 --> 01:58:48,850
You tell a good joke, hey,
that's great. You get, you know,

2070
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:53,200
two credits. If your joke is bad
and considered an appropriate,

2071
01:58:53,201 --> 01:58:57,730
it's negative 39 not worth
it. Yeah. It's not worth it.

2072
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,880
And again, I'm all
about, you know, you are,

2073
01:58:59,881 --> 01:59:01,600
you want to have fun when you're briefing.

2074
01:59:01,601 --> 01:59:03,400
You want people to be
entertained and have fun,

2075
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:06,260
but you don't want to have
inappropriate stuff. No. Yeah.

2076
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:10,870
So that's that for both these,
for both these things.

2077
01:59:10,871 --> 01:59:13,530
Am I joking too much or am I
being too serious? Am I, you know,

2078
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:17,610
is my ego too big or am
I being too humble? You,

2079
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:19,840
it's a balance. It's a
dichotomy, leadership.

2080
01:59:19,841 --> 01:59:22,330
And you've got to find the right spot
in the middle and you've got to check

2081
01:59:22,331 --> 01:59:24,340
yourself and you gotta you know,

2082
01:59:24,640 --> 01:59:27,010
if your team is joking when they
shouldn't be joking, guess what?

2083
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:28,360
You're leading them the wrong direction.

2084
01:59:29,260 --> 01:59:33,370
If your team is somber and
doesn't have any spirit,

2085
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:36,490
you're not having good enough times.
So you gotta find the balance there.

2086
01:59:36,491 --> 01:59:37,570
Same thing with ego.
You know,

2087
01:59:37,571 --> 01:59:41,830
are people talking with
you and communicating with
you and being open with you

2088
01:59:42,700 --> 01:59:45,820
and telling you when they disagree with
things or is no one talking to you.

2089
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:49,210
Cause if that's the case, your ego's so
big that they don't want to talk to you.

2090
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:55,090
So find the dichotomy of leadership to
find the balance between those two. Dang,

2091
01:59:55,091 --> 01:59:59,300
that's a good one. If, if
they're, um, if they're not
talking to you, cause you know,

2092
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:03,640
Holland at work, you're talking
with your friends, you know,

2093
02:00:03,730 --> 02:00:07,950
then then somebody comes, that
person comes who, you know,

2094
02:00:08,350 --> 02:00:10,990
for whatever reason,
you're not necessarily talking about them,

2095
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:15,670
but they come in your car, you got to
stop your conversation, you know? Yeah.

2096
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:17,860
It does like a little indicator,
you know, if you roll up to,

2097
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:20,710
you see people across the room
talking and you're like, hey,

2098
02:00:20,711 --> 02:00:25,200
that looks like a cool conversation or
whatever. I'm going to go say hi to Paul,

2099
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:28,600
whatever. And you go and they stopped
talking and they stopped laughing.

2100
02:00:28,601 --> 02:00:31,090
They just stopped talking and they
give you like small talk or whatever.

2101
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:34,850
That's an indicator. Yeah,
it's an indicator. Uh,

2102
02:00:34,851 --> 02:00:36,370
could be actually either one of those too.

2103
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:38,920
If people are having a good time and
you walk in and they stop laughing,

2104
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:40,150
all of a sudden you say,
okay.

2105
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:43,970
And if you walk in and they're having
a conversation that they don't,

2106
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:46,660
they just don't want to talk to you.
They're probably,

2107
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:49,930
they probably don't like your big
ego that's slapping them in the face.

2108
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,780
Okay. Put your ego in check. Yup.

2109
02:00:54,630 --> 02:00:56,860
We've got time for one more.
One more.

2110
02:00:59,410 --> 02:01:00,243
Jocko.

2111
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:04,510
Do you ever get worn down by everything
you're trying to do and the things going

2112
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:08,770
wrong and things not working and having
to work so hard only to come up short.

2113
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:14,350
What do you do then?
Of course

2114
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:19,570
meet. Of course. Of
course. I get worn down.

2115
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:24,000
Of course I get frustrated with stuff.
Of course.

2116
02:01:24,001 --> 02:01:25,710
Things don't always go my way.

2117
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:32,100
Then of course I come up short sometimes

2118
02:01:33,930 --> 02:01:34,763
of course.

2119
02:01:37,080 --> 02:01:40,370
But what do I do?
Those things happen.

2120
02:01:44,310 --> 02:01:45,143
Yeah,

2121
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:49,420
I keep going.
It's,

2122
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:52,660
it's really that simple.

2123
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:55,960
I put one foot in front of the other.

2124
02:01:55,961 --> 02:01:59,890
I move forward another
inch on another centimeter.

2125
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:03,503
Aye.

2126
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:05,470
Right.
One more sentence.

2127
02:02:05,890 --> 02:02:10,020
I I in place one board brick on the wall.

2128
02:02:10,021 --> 02:02:12,520
I got through one more workout.

2129
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:17,030
I step out onto the mat one more time

2130
02:02:20,270 --> 02:02:24,740
because
because worn down

2131
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:27,730
isn't beaten

2132
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:33,570
and frustration is not going to kill me

2133
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:39,580
and the things that don't go my way,

2134
02:02:40,240 --> 02:02:43,960
they just turn into targets that
I'm going to attack hoarder.

2135
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:50,920
And when I do come up short,

2136
02:02:53,830 --> 02:02:58,830
it's okay cause I just learned one more
thing that's going to get me over the

2137
02:02:59,931 --> 02:03:04,730
top.
So

2138
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:09,800
at those moments,
those low points,

2139
02:03:09,801 --> 02:03:12,880
those times when it seems right,

2140
02:03:14,510 --> 02:03:15,343
that defeat

2141
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:19,030
is starting to get the upper hand.

2142
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:25,050
You don't need some grand plan
and you don't need a pep talk

2143
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:31,570
and you don't need a miracle.

2144
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:39,010
You just need to keep going,

2145
02:03:43,510 --> 02:03:45,130
keep going,

2146
02:03:45,250 --> 02:03:50,250
just keep going and don't stop
regardless of what you are hit with.

2147
02:03:54,460 --> 02:03:58,360
Because if you don't stop yourself,

2148
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:00,900
okay,

2149
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:05,900
the nothing else can
and nothing else will.

2150
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:15,270
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

2151
02:04:16,680 --> 02:04:18,800
So Echo,

2152
02:04:19,740 --> 02:04:24,740
why don't you go ahead and talk about how
we can support this podcast if we want

2153
02:04:26,281 --> 02:04:30,870
to, if we want to, and support
yourself if we want to,

2154
02:04:30,871 --> 02:04:35,220
which we do by the way. So we talk
about on it, on it supplements,

2155
02:04:36,780 --> 02:04:38,040
physical and mental,
by

2156
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,060
the way. So I think, uh, you know, I,

2157
02:04:40,061 --> 02:04:43,830
I know if we failed to mention this or
we just been mentioning it a little bit

2158
02:04:43,831 --> 02:04:48,670
less, which is Alpha brain
we haven't talked about.

2159
02:04:48,690 --> 02:04:51,810
I feel like we haven't talked about
Alpha brain and that much recently.

2160
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:57,240
Been taking it by the way, but not
talking about it. Um, this is good. Okay.

2161
02:04:57,241 --> 02:05:01,260
So it's a new shoe. They call it a
nootropic or nootropic nootropics.

2162
02:05:01,261 --> 02:05:04,020
I'm like that helps your brain
nutrients to your brain. Boom. Directly.

2163
02:05:04,710 --> 02:05:08,220
So two forms.
The instant it's like powder,

2164
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:12,180
you mix it up with your
Gatorade or whatever, whatever.
No, you don't need that.

2165
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:17,940
It doesn't, you can mix it on its own,
right, right. There's two flavors.

2166
02:05:19,810 --> 02:05:24,810
There's peach and then there's natural
spice and they get the two flavors tastes

2167
02:05:27,150 --> 02:05:29,080
exactly like what they sound,
what they're named.

2168
02:05:29,940 --> 02:05:34,720
Peaches tastes like peach and natural
spice. All natural spice kick too.

2169
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:35,191
But it's also,

2170
02:05:35,191 --> 02:05:39,150
it's got a little peach but it's got
a little natural spices was like Dang,

2171
02:05:39,151 --> 02:05:42,420
I didn't know those two flavors.
Yeah I have both. What is this one?

2172
02:05:42,430 --> 02:05:46,620
This one is all this one is natural
spice. Central Spice. Yeah. Dagit boom.

2173
02:05:46,621 --> 02:05:49,710
But they have, they, they,
they taste sweet. Right?

2174
02:05:49,950 --> 02:05:54,030
So you don't need to mix it with Gatorade
and you shouldn't be having Gatorade

2175
02:05:54,031 --> 02:05:57,780
anyways cause it's just a bunch
of sugar in water even at a punch.

2176
02:05:57,781 --> 02:06:01,800
But we'll say some, some
electrolytes in it. Nonetheless,

2177
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:05,430
mix it with whatever you want, man.
Um, or just poured it into your body.

2178
02:06:05,460 --> 02:06:09,390
It's powder. That's the thing compared
to the capsules. Yup. Whatever you like,

2179
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:09,950
you know,

2180
02:06:09,950 --> 02:06:12,810
don't have the powder one is called
instant so it goes to your brain quick,

2181
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:17,130
quicker. That's just an assumption
nonetheless here. This is what it does,

2182
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:17,940
which is cool.

2183
02:06:17,940 --> 02:06:21,540
So you know how like you know how you're
talking to somebody and you blank out

2184
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:26,450
on some something like somebody whose
name no, whatever you're doing today.

2185
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:30,240
Today because you gave me a word. Yeah. I
don't think that's tackled before. Wait.

2186
02:06:30,270 --> 02:06:35,000
Oh, before we were recording while we
were recording live acquaintance. Yes.

2187
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:37,700
Acquaintance. I didn't have
enough Alpha brain. No,

2188
02:06:37,710 --> 02:06:40,920
that was before we were recording
anything. No. All right. Well there it is.

2189
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:44,100
Either way. That's what it does. Do
you need more Alpha brain now? No,

2190
02:06:44,101 --> 02:06:44,701
I think you do.

2191
02:06:44,701 --> 02:06:48,840
I think I'm right cause I took two of
these and I think that that I'm correct

2192
02:06:48,900 --> 02:06:50,100
nonetheless.
Doesn't even matter.

2193
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:54,040
Because what it does is it
makes you do that like whale,

2194
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:58,290
actually you don't even do it. And I'm,
I don't, I mean maybe that's a deficient,

2195
02:06:58,291 --> 02:07:00,960
something about some kind of
deficiency when that happens. You know,

2196
02:07:00,961 --> 02:07:03,510
when they call them brain farts,
I'm having a brain fart. You know,

2197
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:08,340
you don't get brands in cosmetics.
It's like Gasx for your brain essentially.

2198
02:07:08,430 --> 02:07:12,000
You know how like Gasx you know
what that does, right? So you don't,

2199
02:07:12,030 --> 02:07:15,330
you don't do that. You don't have to think
of words anymore. They just calm. Boom.

2200
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:20,670
For Real. Now I don't want, I kind
of don't want to bring this up,

2201
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:24,660
but I will anyways because I don't
want to give people bias. What I don't,

2202
02:07:24,690 --> 02:07:26,670
you can tell him about
cognitive bias services,

2203
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:31,500
but if you heard people like your
brother jade who says when he takes Alpha

2204
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:36,490
brain, his dreams get all crazy.
Yeah. So that's another thing that I,

2205
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:40,930
and I've, I've seen, I've talked to other
people that, that get more vivid dreams,

2206
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:42,710
right? With the Alpha Brady. Yeah.

2207
02:07:42,970 --> 02:07:47,890
So that's another thing just to be aware
of now just I want, I don't want to,

2208
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,360
what kind of cognitive biases that,

2209
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:53,770
that's not availability bias because I
said it and now you're waiting for it.

2210
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:55,720
And so now you have a favorite
dream you think is the Alpha brain.

2211
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:59,960
That's our goal. Right? Right. That's like
that's a placebo effect. Yeah, I guess.

2212
02:07:59,961 --> 02:08:03,850
But you're attributing it to something.
You're attributing it to Alpha brain all.

2213
02:08:03,851 --> 02:08:07,450
Yeah. Huh. So anyways, that is a bias.

2214
02:08:07,480 --> 02:08:12,480
You may notice that your
dreams become more vivid.

2215
02:08:13,180 --> 02:08:15,940
I don't notice it,
but I've heard some people say it.

2216
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,220
I think I heard Joe Rogan talking about,
I heard a Monday.

2217
02:08:18,221 --> 02:08:19,960
And jade is one of those.
Jay Definitely,

2218
02:08:20,110 --> 02:08:22,090
he said it before I even
heard anyone else say.

2219
02:08:22,160 --> 02:08:25,540
He's like all that's like a good thing.
He didn't, it wasn't a complaint too.

2220
02:08:25,541 --> 02:08:30,440
That's the thing. Lucid dreaming,
see change. But yeah, I liked it.

2221
02:08:30,460 --> 02:08:31,450
I don't have lucid dreams.

2222
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:35,620
I have savage nightmares is what I
have and I wake up in a pool of sweat.

2223
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:39,790
It's just a get some, an Alpha
brain fueled. Savage nightmare.

2224
02:08:40,270 --> 02:08:42,310
Don't need that.
We're not going to visit down.

2225
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:44,020
Hopefully that doesn't happen to you,

2226
02:08:44,021 --> 02:08:48,160
but the benefit that I am going to claim
and this and it's proven to, by the way,

2227
02:08:48,730 --> 02:08:53,730
in a double blind placebo test official
off of rain helps with your like recall,

2228
02:08:54,461 --> 02:08:55,870
like your memory and all that stuff,

2229
02:08:56,020 --> 02:08:58,360
which that's essentially what
it is when you think about it,

2230
02:08:58,570 --> 02:09:01,720
when you get a little that one
word bone that recap on boom, boom.

2231
02:09:01,721 --> 02:09:04,210
It's just firing. That's
how often brain, so yeah,

2232
02:09:04,211 --> 02:09:06,820
if you're about to do something where
you got to think and talk a lot,

2233
02:09:06,880 --> 02:09:11,440
which is everything good on that Alpha
bring, then you'd be glad you did.

2234
02:09:11,620 --> 02:09:15,490
I took what I used to do a lot,
so before,

2235
02:09:15,610 --> 02:09:18,190
before I knew how to switch
to manual mode. Regardless,

2236
02:09:18,490 --> 02:09:21,430
I would take a pre workout and Alpha brain

2237
02:09:23,110 --> 02:09:25,000
and it helped. Whose money? Yeah.

2238
02:09:25,610 --> 02:09:28,180
I actually got one of my better
workouts on that little formula,

2239
02:09:28,181 --> 02:09:31,030
so I just kept doing it. But you know how
you'd do something over and over again,

2240
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:36,220
whether the physiologically or otherwise,
you just, you tend to lose that. Yeah.

2241
02:09:36,221 --> 02:09:39,270
It's like if you take caffeine
all the time. Yes. Yeah.

2242
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:42,580
In a way it's the same thing. I say
Alpha brain is like take it all the time.

2243
02:09:42,830 --> 02:09:45,490
Right? You get on the regular.
Yeah, it'd be in the blood. Yeah.

2244
02:09:45,491 --> 02:09:47,630
So mine more left that
to do with like the,

2245
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:50,830
the direct effect of Alpha brain and my
memory and recall it was more about the

2246
02:09:50,831 --> 02:09:55,510
kind of workout I got, you know, placebo,
by the way. Maybe, maybe not though.

2247
02:09:55,511 --> 02:09:58,820
That's the thing. Or maybe I was just
thinking of more cool stuff, you know,

2248
02:09:58,870 --> 02:10:03,100
so it was more enjoyable work out.
Could have been that perhaps. Maybe not.

2249
02:10:03,550 --> 02:10:05,920
Nonetheless, we can stick to
the evidence and the proof.

2250
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:10,340
You'll recall stuff better.
Remember,

2251
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:14,470
memorize things better. It's
good all day, every day.

2252
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:20,430
I'm also like got that strong bone
member a few weeks back I'll say does a

2253
02:10:20,700 --> 02:10:25,390
strong you're, yeah, the facts.
Strontium. It's one of those things.

2254
02:10:25,391 --> 02:10:28,210
Here's the thing too. You read the
thing, so calcium is, that's the,

2255
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:33,500
that's the flagship element,
mineral element, whatever.

2256
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:37,340
Calcium, that's the one that gets all
the credit for your bones. It's like,

2257
02:10:37,770 --> 02:10:41,570
you know the strontium is like the
stepchild is like as far as recognition,

2258
02:10:41,571 --> 02:10:43,790
but strontium is super
important and you lose that.

2259
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:46,370
You know when you get old and whatever.
But that's what,

2260
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:51,170
that's a strong bone is
you think strontium? Yeah.

2261
02:10:51,200 --> 02:10:53,750
You think it's strong bone
makes your bones strong,

2262
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:57,050
which I think that's on purpose too.
It's like a little play on words.

2263
02:10:57,410 --> 02:11:02,180
You think so? I think so. I'll
he's smart like 10 anyway,

2264
02:11:02,190 --> 02:11:06,170
take that strong will I? I did it because
as you know, I had a bicep surgery,

2265
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:11,080
tend to know my bicep ripped off my bone.
So if I'm still lifting,

2266
02:11:11,081 --> 02:11:15,770
I still do curls, whatever I said it,
I don't need that thing ripping off.

2267
02:11:15,771 --> 02:11:18,660
I don't need tendinitis. I don't
need problems. I don't need issues.

2268
02:11:19,130 --> 02:11:23,390
I've got on that strong bone. Also, I take
Krill oil. Jocko. Do you take Krill oil?

2269
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:26,750
Affirmative? I think you've been
taking Krill oil longer than I haven't.

2270
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:30,200
And when I say I think it
means I know long crime,

2271
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:35,150
even though I've been hearing great
things about Krill oil from day one.

2272
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:39,380
So anyway, on the Krill oil that helps
with joints. It gives you this feeling.

2273
02:11:39,381 --> 02:11:41,600
I said this before,
I will say it again.

2274
02:11:41,601 --> 02:11:44,270
It gives you this feeling
where then this physically,

2275
02:11:44,271 --> 02:11:48,380
it's not emotionally feelings
or emotional, just Fyi.

2276
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:54,300
No feeling doe. If I flick your finger,
you're going to feel that true. So this,

2277
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:58,520
yeah, no, no. All good.
All good. You feel like,

2278
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:02,660
like if you're sitting down for a
long time and then you stand up. Yeah,

2279
02:12:02,770 --> 02:12:04,500
we'll talk about it,
but when I stand,

2280
02:12:08,460 --> 02:12:12,980
I stand up. Well, you're on Krill oil, so
this applies to you too. When we stand up,

2281
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:15,920
if Greg train was here like
we were like a few weeks ago,

2282
02:12:16,190 --> 02:12:18,320
if great train was right,
he wasn't on the Krill oil.

2283
02:12:18,830 --> 02:12:22,580
We all stand up after the same
amount of time, two hours ish.

2284
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:28,880
He will be compelled to be
like, ah, make that sound crazy.

2285
02:12:28,881 --> 02:12:31,190
But he'll be compelled to make that sound.
Whether it makes it or not,

2286
02:12:31,191 --> 02:12:34,880
he's going to feel like making
it meet. I won't you. You won't.

2287
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:39,380
Krill oil makes your joints young again,

2288
02:12:39,770 --> 02:12:44,690
for lack of better term. Anyway. It helps
though. Yes, but in all seriousness,

2289
02:12:44,720 --> 02:12:48,560
if you are like lifting weights,
going hard, take her along. Yeah,

2290
02:12:48,561 --> 02:12:49,870
take the Krill oil.
It'll,

2291
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:54,880
I mean where would want to do that on
[inaudible] dot com if you want 10% off,

2292
02:12:55,911 --> 02:12:59,660
you go on [inaudible] dot com slash
Jocko it's the best Krill oil too.

2293
02:12:59,690 --> 02:13:04,250
That's the thing. You can get lane
krill oil anywhere. Maybe not anywhere,

2294
02:13:04,251 --> 02:13:08,810
but in other places will say, but the
real deal, that good stuff is on it.

2295
02:13:09,590 --> 02:13:13,030
You don't want to get lame
Krill oil from name Krill. Yeah,

2296
02:13:14,100 --> 02:13:18,080
the hardcore grill. It's true. Do you
know how like um, like Asai Berries,

2297
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:19,380
you know like you know,
you,

2298
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:25,100
you can get junk os I eat like the
reject us I and paid like cheaper.

2299
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:29,450
Actually this Krill oil is actually super
good price anyway and you get 10% off

2300
02:13:29,630 --> 02:13:31,770
from [inaudible] dot com slash
chocolate that's a 10% offer.

2301
02:13:32,130 --> 02:13:35,820
Nonetheless, back to the,
let's see berries, you can get
the junk cane in, treaties,

2302
02:13:35,821 --> 02:13:39,890
junk Asai Berries and then taste good.
Asai berries brought the differences.

2303
02:13:39,920 --> 02:13:43,110
Like you can tell the difference big time.
It's like night and day.

2304
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:46,740
Same thing with the Krill oil. Take
the good on, man. Forget the lame one.

2305
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:52,440
That's just my opinion anyway. Good.
Another good way to support podcasts.

2306
02:13:53,160 --> 02:13:56,880
Amazon. Click through all you do before
you do any of your Amazon shopping,

2307
02:13:57,580 --> 02:13:59,910
click through the website
Jockos podcast.com

2308
02:14:01,770 --> 02:14:04,320
I got a little hint from

2309
02:14:06,240 --> 02:14:09,690
somebody in the field that said,
hey,

2310
02:14:09,691 --> 02:14:11,930
when you tell people to do Amazon,
click through.

2311
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:16,680
What you should tell them is to tell
their significant other to click through.

2312
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:21,990
Hmm. For instance, in my case, my wife
buys more things on Amazon than I do.

2313
02:14:22,050 --> 02:14:25,050
I'm in the game.
I'm supporting the podcast,

2314
02:14:25,650 --> 02:14:28,860
but what if my wife doesn't know
about the click through, right.

2315
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:31,980
She needs to get in the game.
Yeah. Double support right there.

2316
02:14:32,010 --> 02:14:36,840
Don't just you do it. Get your
family, get your wife, get your,

2317
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,800
your husband. Right. They're not in the
game. Get them in the game. Yeah. Huh.

2318
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:42,043
That's a lot of,

2319
02:14:42,410 --> 02:14:46,500
a lot of times the the other spouse
is buying the stuff on Amazon. Yeah,

2320
02:14:46,860 --> 02:14:48,870
and they don't know how to support.
Right.

2321
02:14:49,170 --> 02:14:52,200
They don't know about that website or
they're just less compelled or they forgot

2322
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:55,500
and you don't really, technically you
don't know if they forgot or not. You know

2323
02:14:57,630 --> 02:15:00,990
if you're clever,
heard this from Sam Harris.

2324
02:15:02,370 --> 02:15:05,880
I knew this already. I'm be honest,
but I heard it. To reinforce it,

2325
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:09,450
where some people they will click
through and before they do shopping,

2326
02:15:09,451 --> 02:15:12,810
they get that you little URL. Boom. Save
it to favorites. Save it two to Bodie.

2327
02:15:12,811 --> 02:15:17,040
Call it bookmarks, both and then
top. So boom, it's there. It's a,

2328
02:15:17,041 --> 02:15:18,420
it's in the front of your head now.

2329
02:15:19,320 --> 02:15:23,580
It's a good way to support small action
takes what? Three seconds if that,

2330
02:15:23,850 --> 02:15:26,140
if that. Yeah, and huge support.

2331
02:15:26,170 --> 02:15:29,520
It's like huge reinforcements
enforcements. Actually.

2332
02:15:29,970 --> 02:15:32,700
That's how strong support it
is. Small action. Big Reaction.

2333
02:15:35,050 --> 02:15:40,020
Yup. Like sodium when you throw it in
water. Anyway, subscribe to the podcast.

If you want. Itunes, Cornell,
deep shelf. Could you play?

2335
02:15:45,410 --> 02:15:48,060
That's the best example you can think of.
Really.

2336
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:52,050
You want me to say anything else, man?
He said it. We're good over here. Yeah.

2343
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:19,830
you go on there and you, hey, let me see
this podcast. You got to search podcasts.

2344
02:16:19,831 --> 02:16:24,270
You got to type it in on your phone.
It's actually not that big of a deal,

2345
02:16:24,271 --> 02:16:26,700
but it'd be even less of a big deal.
If you subscribe,

podcast. That's a good way
to support leave a review.

2348
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:38,950
If you're in the mood chocolates, said
something extra dope. You're like, hey,

2349
02:16:38,951 --> 02:16:42,550
I liked that. Leave Review. Feel
free like Nate got, I don't want,

2350
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:47,720
what do you call that? Muzzle? Like what
you put on the dogs to stop them. Yeah.

2351
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:50,650
We're not trying to muzzle anybody.

2352
02:16:50,651 --> 02:16:55,130
I was thinking about a muzzle
over here for something to see,

2353
02:16:55,210 --> 02:16:58,000
and it's good that you
exercise a no muzzle policy.

2354
02:16:58,001 --> 02:17:01,210
And I think that policy should extend
to anyone who's listening and want to

2355
02:17:01,211 --> 02:17:02,980
support this podcast.
That's what I think.

2356
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,220
And apparently that's what you think
too. And I liked that obviously. Yeah.

2357
02:17:06,440 --> 02:17:10,180
So subscribe. Also subscribe to Youtube.
Yeah, we have a youtube channel.

2358
02:17:10,210 --> 02:17:12,130
I know I say it every week.
I'm gonna say it again.

2359
02:17:12,131 --> 02:17:14,140
I'll say it this week we
have a youtube channel.

2360
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:19,660
Video version of this podcast is on the
youtube channel, which is cool. Obvious,

2361
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:24,130
right? But with strong recommendations
from Jocko, from others

2362
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,823
online,

2363
02:17:27,850 --> 02:17:32,290
they recommended that you cut out
little excerpts, put them on Youtube,

2364
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:35,410
even make a playlist, which I did
and did it. We did all of that stuff.

2365
02:17:35,411 --> 02:17:38,230
So there's excerpts on there. If you
want to listen to three minutes of junk.

2366
02:17:38,231 --> 02:17:40,870
Old opinion on what Jim,
what home gym, what?

2367
02:17:40,871 --> 02:17:45,310
What equipment makes a good home gym.
You want to listen to that? Boom.

2368
02:17:45,670 --> 02:17:49,930
It's available right there. How
should I approach college? Boom.

2369
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:53,770
Jock advice right there. So these
exit, I think they're actually,

2370
02:17:53,771 --> 02:17:57,520
the more I kind of look at them and
stuff I think is a valuable situation.

2371
02:17:57,770 --> 02:18:00,910
Can you can share him easy and people
are way more likely to listen to little

2372
02:18:00,911 --> 02:18:04,870
excerpts in the whole thing if you're
trying to get one element of the podcast.

2373
02:18:05,620 --> 02:18:10,600
So yeah, youtube subscribe to that. Good
way to support. Good way to support. Also,

2374
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:13,360
Jack was a store called Jocko store.
If,

2375
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:15,080
okay,

2376
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:18,620
you want to wear tee shirts and represent,
we've got some new ones.

2377
02:18:18,621 --> 02:18:23,360
We've got a new one on there. Um, but
regardless of the new ones, old ones,

2378
02:18:23,361 --> 02:18:24,410
whichever,
just go in there,

2379
02:18:24,411 --> 02:18:29,330
see if you like one get one good
way to support and boom, tee shirt.

2380
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:31,940
Also hoodies,
rash guards,

2381
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:37,670
which you're not my words, other
people's words, they're pretty dope.

2382
02:18:39,140 --> 02:18:39,771
So you know,

2383
02:18:39,771 --> 02:18:44,690
if you're into activity that you like
range of motion and you want to represent

2384
02:18:44,691 --> 02:18:46,760
and you want to support,
get a rash guard that those are good.

2385
02:18:46,761 --> 02:18:51,470
I did them for Jujitsu originally. But
Pam, if, yeah, if you, if you serve,

2386
02:18:51,530 --> 02:18:55,850
if you do crossfit,
metcons, whatnot, cycling,

2387
02:18:56,990 --> 02:18:58,070
run marathons.

2388
02:18:58,820 --> 02:19:02,090
I'm listing all the things that people
send me pictures of them doing in their

2389
02:19:02,091 --> 02:19:05,210
rash guard. So that's why I'm
going down this list. Other stuff,

2390
02:19:05,300 --> 02:19:08,450
if you do all that perfect for that too.
Very perfect.

2391
02:19:09,800 --> 02:19:14,720
Can something be very perfect? It's
either perfect or not, right? Yup. Yeah.

2392
02:19:14,930 --> 02:19:18,500
Either way. This is women's stuff
on there. Uh, some patches, velcro

2393
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,200
regulation size and color,
um, hoodies as well. Also,

2394
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:29,930
maybe the mugs are on there,
maybe not. Nonetheless.

2395
02:19:29,931 --> 02:19:34,280
I'll talk more about the travel
mugs later next time. Also

2396
02:19:35,950 --> 02:19:39,320
go Jocko, store.com. I think
I said that, but if you know,

2397
02:19:39,410 --> 02:19:43,550
there it is a reminder Jocko
starr.com is the website. That's okay.

2398
02:19:43,790 --> 02:19:47,540
Good way to support and support yourself.
Psychological warfare.

2399
02:19:47,810 --> 02:19:50,750
What psychological warfare is, I know
you said it before. I'll say it again.

2400
02:19:50,751 --> 02:19:54,980
Psychological warfare is an album
with tracks, not music tracks.

2401
02:19:55,640 --> 02:20:00,590
Jocko tracks.
And if you are,

2402
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:06,260
you know, I'm starting to not
like the word self improvement.

2403
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:11,060
I already don't like that word. Right?
Yeah. It kind of like starting to, yeah.

2404
02:20:11,061 --> 02:20:14,660
You know, it's kind of like
it. Yeah. And I'm to the point,

2405
02:20:14,661 --> 02:20:18,440
I'm like midway through not liking it.
You know, the phases is like doom, boom.

2406
02:20:18,441 --> 02:20:21,530
You hear something, you're like, okay,
that's cool and acceptable mid phases.

2407
02:20:21,531 --> 02:20:25,370
Like that's cool, but I don't
like how it sounds when I say it.

2408
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:28,400
And then the last phase is you don't,
you just don't want to hear it. I mean,

2409
02:20:28,401 --> 02:20:30,740
you made phase so, but I'm
going to use it, you know,

2410
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:35,150
for just for the greater good.
If you're going to self improvement path.

2411
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:39,730
Journey journey is another one
of those words that you know,

2412
02:20:39,740 --> 02:20:42,770
you're waking up early,
you're doing workouts now consistently.

2413
02:20:42,800 --> 02:20:45,440
You're consistently,
consistently eating good.

2414
02:20:47,060 --> 02:20:50,540
What about studying and reading and
getting smarter too. Yeah, those studying,

2415
02:20:51,080 --> 02:20:52,760
reading,
um,

2416
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:57,620
writing even anything creative,
you know, man, when you,

2417
02:20:58,740 --> 02:21:01,280
and that's the thing that jams people up
when they're like, hey, I should do this.

2418
02:21:01,281 --> 02:21:06,110
I should write my ebook, or I should, I
should do a journal every day or whatever,

2419
02:21:06,140 --> 02:21:08,690
you know, and they'll do it one day
and then they just won't do it anymore.

2420
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:12,560
You know? That's the thing.
So anyway, you've been,
regardless of what you're doing,

2421
02:21:12,680 --> 02:21:13,950
these tracks,
psychological part,

2422
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:18,650
these tracks will help you
through this at times of weakness.

2423
02:21:20,330 --> 02:21:22,610
If you're trying to get up in
the morning and it's that day,

2424
02:21:22,700 --> 02:21:26,360
you know you had a long night and a
hard workout that morning that you're

2425
02:21:26,361 --> 02:21:29,450
looking forward to or not looking forward
to and you're like, you know what,

2426
02:21:29,451 --> 02:21:31,820
I'm going to just going to snooze
or I'm going to skip the workout.

2427
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:35,690
You listen to a certain one or
two or three of these tracks.

2428
02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:39,140
It's Jacqueline who gets you through
that moment of weakness and you will work

2429
02:21:39,141 --> 02:21:41,690
out.
You will wake up early,

2430
02:21:42,480 --> 02:21:45,680
100% probability with very few,

2431
02:21:45,681 --> 02:21:47,720
if any exceptions.

2432
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:52,790
Also on Amazon while
you're clicking through,

2433
02:21:52,880 --> 02:21:57,470
you can get some Jocko white tea,
which has some pretty good effects.

2434
02:21:57,590 --> 02:21:59,240
I just pulled a couple of reviews out.

2435
02:22:00,110 --> 02:22:04,400
This one here says drinking Jockos white
tea has had the following effects on my

2436
02:22:04,401 --> 02:22:06,110
life getting after it up.

2437
02:22:06,111 --> 02:22:11,111
55% extreme ownership up 92% mm hmm.

2438
02:22:12,140 --> 02:22:12,980
And also by the way,

2439
02:22:12,981 --> 02:22:17,300
cruising all day up 108%
so that's important.

2440
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:23,770
Also dead lift when from three 25 to
five 55 20 pull ups instead of sets of

2441
02:22:26,820 --> 02:22:28,530
solid.
That's good improvement.

2442
02:22:28,710 --> 02:22:33,510
I don't think anyone would instead
of instead of five, five yeah,

2443
02:22:33,720 --> 02:22:34,051
it's good.

2444
02:22:34,051 --> 02:22:37,170
There's another person that drank the
tea and I thought that this was important

2445
02:22:37,260 --> 02:22:40,050
because it could happen to other people.
Okay.

2446
02:22:40,051 --> 02:22:45,051
So this person bought some Jocko white
tea for myself and my next workout was so

2447
02:22:45,631 --> 02:22:46,464
aggressive.

2448
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:51,060
I got a strongly worded letter
from the UN to cease hostilities.

2449
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:55,740
So I don't, I don't like seeing
UN involvement on our workouts,

2450
02:22:55,741 --> 02:22:57,990
but if you're not careful it might happen.

2451
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:01,380
And also there's another person I
hadn't talked about front squatting,

2452
02:23:02,640 --> 02:23:03,473
but you know,

2453
02:23:03,600 --> 02:23:08,010
one person that has been drinking Jocko
white tea is now front squatting about

2454
02:23:08,011 --> 02:23:12,790
2000 pounds. Again, just Jocko
white tea, no big deal. Uh,

2455
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:17,100
to double, triple, quadruple.
[inaudible]. Ultimate tested.

2456
02:23:17,710 --> 02:23:21,640
Flawless.
Yeah.

2457
02:23:21,750 --> 02:23:26,490
Jocko white tea man tastes good
and it is good also right now,

2458
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:30,510
the way of the warrior kid, it's
out. We've been waiting for it.

2459
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:34,560
I've been waiting for it.
Boom. Thanks everyone for
picking it up. Getting a copy.

2460
02:23:34,860 --> 02:23:39,750
If you haven't gotten it
yet, get it. You know what,

2461
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:42,150
you probably don't.
You probably wonder if you need it.

2462
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:43,800
Maybe you think you don't need it.

2463
02:23:44,730 --> 02:23:48,420
So then Lexar little excerpt for you.

2464
02:23:49,470 --> 02:23:52,500
Now this is young mark.
He couldn't do any pull ups.

2465
02:23:54,120 --> 02:23:56,370
You couldn't do any pull ups. He's in
fifth grade, couldn't do any followups.

2466
02:23:56,430 --> 02:23:58,320
Sure get made fun of.

2467
02:23:58,830 --> 02:24:02,040
People are laughing at him because
he can't do any pull ups. His uncle,

2468
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:07,050
uncle Jake, he stays with them for the
summer. Uncle Jake's and the seal teams,

2469
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,020
Uncle Jake gets them
on the workout program.

2470
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:15,320
What you and I are commonly referred to
as the program gets him on the program

2471
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:21,380
and it's been a few weeks now and
uncle Jake realizes that mark,

2472
02:24:21,511 --> 02:24:24,960
he's been doing negatives and he's been
doing assisted pull ups and he's been

2473
02:24:25,110 --> 02:24:28,110
doing the pyramids, but just to hanging
on the bar, doing all those things,

2474
02:24:28,111 --> 02:24:32,430
getting ready and uncle Jake realized
now he's ready to do his first pull up.

2475
02:24:32,430 --> 02:24:34,770
So he says to him, you know,
okay, you're going to get on.

2476
02:24:34,890 --> 02:24:36,420
You can do your first pull up today

2477
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:43,170
and we'll go to the back to the
book. There you go. He said,

2478
02:24:43,200 --> 02:24:45,210
giddy up.
Get on the bar

2479
02:24:47,410 --> 02:24:52,210
and here's young mark. I was filled with
fear every time I had tried in the past,

2480
02:24:52,211 --> 02:24:55,600
no matter how hard I pulled,
I could never get my chin over the bar.

2481
02:24:56,790 --> 02:25:01,680
Now with uncle Jake standing right here
after all the work is done with me,

2482
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:03,840
I just didn't think I'd be able to do it.

2483
02:25:05,100 --> 02:25:09,840
I stood there looking up at the
bar. Well, what are you waiting for?

2484
02:25:10,380 --> 02:25:11,370
Said Uncle Jake.

2485
02:25:12,420 --> 02:25:15,840
I slowly stepped up on the box
and reached up for the bar.

2486
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:20,900
The bar was cool in my hands and I
noticed something that I hadn't thought

2487
02:25:21,211 --> 02:25:25,840
about. My grip in the, my grip always felt
like it was going to slip off the bar.

2488
02:25:25,990 --> 02:25:29,800
My grip felt different.
Now it felt strong.

2489
02:25:31,300 --> 02:25:36,300
I concentrated and then after taking a
big breath I pulled and I went up and up

2490
02:25:40,180 --> 02:25:44,770
and up and soon my chin cleared
the top of the bar. Yes,

2491
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:48,700
I had done it. I let myself down
solely and dropped off the bar.

2492
02:25:48,730 --> 02:25:52,600
I looked at my uncle, he had a big
smile on his face, a big smile.

2493
02:25:52,660 --> 02:25:57,280
He was happy and I was even happier.
It felt so good.

2494
02:25:58,300 --> 02:26:00,460
I looked at Uncle Jake and yelled Ya.

2495
02:26:01,060 --> 02:26:05,620
As I curled both my fist towards my
shoulder like I'd seen weightlifters do in

2496
02:26:05,621 --> 02:26:10,621
magazines and I could actually tell for
the first time in my life I was starting

2497
02:26:11,381 --> 02:26:16,330
to get some muscles. Nothing huge, but
they were certainly their muscle man.

2498
02:26:16,331 --> 02:26:18,970
Mark,
I shouted as proud as I could be.

2499
02:26:20,830 --> 02:26:25,000
Then I saw uncle Jake smiled disappear.
Hold on.

2500
02:26:25,001 --> 02:26:29,380
Their muscle man said Uncle Jake.
I didn't know what was wrong,

2501
02:26:29,440 --> 02:26:30,370
but something was,

2502
02:26:31,150 --> 02:26:34,840
I think it's a bit early
for a celebration early.

2503
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:37,390
I just did the first pull up of my life.

2504
02:26:37,810 --> 02:26:40,930
I think it's the perfect time for
a celebration. I told Uncle Jake,

2505
02:26:42,280 --> 02:26:47,260
that's a problem. Uncle Jake said a
problem. Why is it pull up a problem?

2506
02:26:48,340 --> 02:26:53,080
Not the pull up mark. The celebration.
It is way too early for celebrating,

2507
02:26:53,650 --> 02:26:58,510
but I just did my first pull up ever.
But your goal isn't one pull up.

2508
02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:02,050
Your goal is 10 pull ups.
You did one.

2509
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:07,300
Sure you have a reason to be happy.
One pull up is better than zero,

2510
02:27:07,780 --> 02:27:12,550
but it's a long way from 10
no matter what you're doing in life,

2511
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:17,560
you can't take your eyes off the long
term goal, especially to celebrate.

2512
02:27:18,910 --> 02:27:19,870
You can assess,

2513
02:27:20,110 --> 02:27:24,550
you can try and figure out some lessons
learned from what you did right and what

2514
02:27:24,551 --> 02:27:28,810
you did wrong. You can even do a little
celebrating for the small victories,

2515
02:27:29,890 --> 02:27:33,940
but don't go overboard.
You need to keep your head in the game.

2516
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:34,990
So come over here,

2517
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:38,680
give me a high five and they get back
over there and start doing more work on

2518
02:27:38,681 --> 02:27:41,560
the pullup bar.
This is only the beginning.

2519
02:27:42,910 --> 02:27:46,330
I walked over to uncle Jake who
brought his hand up in the air.

2520
02:27:47,290 --> 02:27:51,190
I slapped it hard and he said,
solid work.

2521
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:56,800
Now get back over there and get after it.
Yes sir.

2522
02:27:56,801 --> 02:28:00,280
I told him
just a little,

2523
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:02,290
another little lesson from Uncle Jake.

2524
02:28:02,291 --> 02:28:05,110
You can't get cocky when you
make the little achievement.

2525
02:28:05,111 --> 02:28:07,390
You've got to keep your eye on the ball.
So that's it.

2526
02:28:09,490 --> 02:28:14,440
Check out that book, order it, weigh
the warrior kid. It's a kid's book.

2527
02:28:14,470 --> 02:28:15,520
That's what they're telling me.

2528
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:19,330
I think we all learned a little something
from it. I know I learned from writing.

2529
02:28:19,331 --> 02:28:21,070
It can also pre a border,

2530
02:28:21,080 --> 02:28:25,250
a book called discipline
equals freedom field manual

2531
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:28,460
and it's we're dialing in right now.

2532
02:28:28,580 --> 02:28:32,660
It's going to come out October
17th it isn't a workout book.

2533
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:37,550
It isn't a philosophy book.
It isn't a photography book.

2534
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,560
It isn't a diet book.

2535
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:41,600
Okay.

2536
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:44,220
It's got all those things in there,
but how do you categorize it?

2537
02:28:45,270 --> 02:28:47,850
Where are you going to put, where are
you gonna put it in the bookstore?

2538
02:28:47,851 --> 02:28:49,950
Where's it going to be?
Where's it going to be on Amazon?

2539
02:28:49,951 --> 02:28:50,784
You know where it's going to be,

2540
02:28:51,660 --> 02:28:55,740
where it's going to be in the get
after it category and you know what?

2541
02:28:55,741 --> 02:28:58,260
It's going to be the only book in
there so you can order that one.

2542
02:28:58,770 --> 02:29:01,020
You can also order extreme ownership.
Of course,

2543
02:29:01,021 --> 02:29:05,880
if you want to lead in when you can
get that book for you and your team.

2544
02:29:08,320 --> 02:29:12,210

2553
02:29:48,090 --> 02:29:53,090
Texas July 13th and 14th at the
Omni Barton creek resort and spa.

2554
02:29:55,530 --> 02:29:56,970
I'm gonna tell you right up,
straight up.

2555
02:29:57,630 --> 02:30:00,030
Don't come for the spa and
not going to see the spot.

2556
02:30:01,440 --> 02:30:04,350
If you can't make the one in Texas,
San Diego,

2557

2559
02:30:14,820 --> 02:30:18,670

leader and as a person.

2560
02:30:18,700 --> 02:30:20,640
We'll see you at one of those monsters.

2561
02:30:20,670 --> 02:30:22,980
Look forward to it when
we're not at the monsters.

2562
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:28,950
We can be found on the interwebs,
on Twitter,

2563
02:30:29,970 --> 02:30:33,150
on Instagram,
and we go on to be here.

2564
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:37,490
Laxing on that phase,
that Phase II book.

2565
02:30:38,020 --> 02:30:43,020
What Echo is at echocharles
and I am at Jocko Willink.

2566
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:49,670
And thanks everybody for listening and
for supporting and for asking these

2567
02:30:49,711 --> 02:30:54,711
questions and for helping us do what we
do to the military personnel overseas.

2568
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:58,293
All of you,

2569
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:04,260
our deepest thanks and appreciation
for your service and sacrifice.

2570
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:05,710
Stay safe.

2571
02:31:06,890 --> 02:31:11,890
The best way to stay safe is to stay
aggressive to the police firefighters,

2572
02:31:12,700 --> 02:31:16,990
EMT, first responders.
Thanks for staying sharp,

2573
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:21,750
training hard and standing.
Watch for us here at home

2574
02:31:23,560 --> 02:31:25,570
and to everybody listening,

2575
02:31:28,490 --> 02:31:31,190
life isn't easy

2576
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:36,020
and it's not supposed to be.
Sure.

2577
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:38,480
There's victories and there's triumphs,

2578
02:31:38,481 --> 02:31:42,020
but there's also losses and setbacks.

2579
02:31:44,510 --> 02:31:49,510
But those losses and setbacks
only win if you let them.

2580
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:53,870
So don't let them,

2581
02:31:55,970 --> 02:31:59,720
don't let them win no matter what happens.

2582
02:32:01,430 --> 02:32:05,390
Keep going,
keep getting after it.

2583
02:32:07,730 --> 02:32:12,500
So until next time, this
is echo and Jocko. Oh

2584
02:32:13,880 --> 02:32:14,180
out.
