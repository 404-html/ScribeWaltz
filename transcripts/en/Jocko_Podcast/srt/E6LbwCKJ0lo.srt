1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,620
This is Jocko podcast number
one 15 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,350
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,193
Okay.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,440
War is different for
everyone who experiences it.

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,370
Okay.

6
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,890
On one end of the spectrum,

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,880
there are some people who deployed to a
safe area and protected by concrete and

8
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,720
steel and Barb wire and their job,

9
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,750
which is definitely an
important part of the machine,

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,510
but it just doesn't require them
to be put into direct combat.

11
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,150
And then with a little luck
because of that situation,

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,290
they can easily complete
a wartime deployment with
little or no contact with the

13
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:56,630
enemy whatsoever.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,030
But they did their part and
we are thankful for that.

15
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,170
On the other end of the spectrum,

16
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,370
there are some people that end
up in anything but a safe area.

17
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:18,530
They end up in the belly of the beast.

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,870
They are called on to do more than is
required and much more than could be

19
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,593
expected.

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,430
And that situation also
creates a spectrum.

21
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,610
Okay.

22
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,000
Some men find it to be too much.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,833
Yeah.

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:49,950
And instincts of self
preservation takeover and they
go into survival mode and

25
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:56,260
they cower and they hide and
they'd give up and they wait.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,630
Yeah.

27
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,700
For the inevitable.

28
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,100
But others do what they can.

29
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,520
They try to do their duty.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,260
They put one foot in front of the other
and they reload their weapon and they

31
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,400
try to keep firing.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,340
That's the middle of the spectrum.

33
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,330
And then at the far end of the spectrum,

34
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,690
there are those men that
step up and go forward

35
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,320
across the threshold,

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,070
really across the threshold of life.

37
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:45,930
And they go into the fire and into the
flame and toward the unknown and toward

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,260
death.
Not to save themselves.

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,273
Yeah.

40
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,360
But they disregard their own safety and
their own life to save they're friends.

41
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:01,980
Yeah.

42
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,850
They're brothers.

43
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,060
Okay.

44
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,010
And their comrades in arms.

45
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,550
And then beyond even that,

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,513
okay,

47
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,780
almost off the spectrum.

48
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,103
Okay.

49
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,110
There are those men that take that step
across the threshold of life and death

50
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:30,490
over and over and over again.
Not because they were ordered to,

51
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,810
not for a metal, not because of
some manufactured set of ideals,

52
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:37,720
but simply because that is who

53
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,050
okay

54
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,883
they are.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,570
And I'm honored to have one of
those men here with me today.

56
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,550
A son,
a father,

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,420
and American. Oh, United States marine,

58
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,970
a man by the name of Mr Dakota Meyer.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Dakota, welcome to the podcast
and thank you for coming on.

60
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:16,770
No, thank you so much for having me. I'm
telling you, I'm honored. I'm honored.

61
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,400
All right.
As we normally do,

62
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,520
let's start from where you started.

63
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:28,990
Tell us a little bit about,
about Columbia, Kentucky. Yeah.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,710
You know, it's, um, it's a small town. You
know, I grew up in Columbia, Kentucky. Um,

65
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,580
you know, I grew up in that first half
of my life with my mother and, uh,

66
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,210
ended up going and living with my
father and um, you know, I didn't,

67
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,300
didn't come from money. You didn't
come from anything nice. You know,

68
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,650
I ended up losing my father.
I'm adopted on my father's side and a,

69
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,660
you grow up on a farm, um,
you know, it's just, just, uh,

70
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,180
just, um, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm,
I'm a simple guy. It's a simple,

71
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,460
it's a simple way of life, you
know what I mean? And that's,

72
00:04:59,461 --> 00:05:01,890
that's just how we grew up.
We, you know, my dad, you know,

73
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:03,370
he always instilled in me and me and my,

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,680
I have to give so much credit to my father
and my grandfather. I mean, I might,

75
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,000
you know,
I mean,

76
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:12,300
they just stay instilled so much in
me of what's right and what mattered,

77
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:14,370
you know, you know, uh,

78
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:16,750
okay,

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,250
we're talking a lot of your childhood
was an, and I wrote down these notes,

80
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,790
farm work, football and
females. Yeah, yeah.

81
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,970
I mean that's a, that I
told you I'm simple. Yeah,

82
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,530
that's it. You know, there's not much
else. Ain't Columbia, Kentucky though.

83
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,950
And uh, you know, you
wrote, you wrote a book,

84
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,990
the book is called into the fire and
that's where I'm getting some of my

85
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,170
information for, from an a, and I would
say that in the early descriptions,

86
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:47,930
the way you described yourself,
not exactly Mr sensitive is,

87
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:49,540
is what we were dealing with back then.

88
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,510
No, not at all. Um, you know, I was,
no, I wasn't sensitive. I was, um,

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,410
I was just a hard kid, you know,
um, set in my ways. I, I, you know,

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,890
my dad just instilled in me, my
dad is still, I mean, you know,

91
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,620
my dad is a man who doesn't, he doesn't
care the social status. He's not, uh,

92
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,860
you know, he, you know, and
I watch it from him and he's
just a hard, hard, hard guy,

93
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:16,310
you know what I mean? And so there's
not living in a house of two men. Right.

94
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,230
You know me, it was just my dad, you
know, there's not very many feeling,

95
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,020
it wasn't a real nourishment to
your sensitive side. There was a,

96
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,300
there was not much nourishment.
Yeah.

97
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,190
There's one part of their talking about
you're in a football game and you jack

98
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:34,420
up your elbow real bad. And so the coach
got you in the locker room or whatever.

99
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,040
Yeah. Yeah. So I was, uh, I was sitting
in the locker room and I mean, I,

100
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,960
I had carried the ball probably 18,
19 times the first half,

101
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,500
and I'd go in there and my
elbows are like, just jacked.
Right? I mean, you know,

102
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,780
just, we were just
getting pounded. And, um,

103
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,080
I remember sitting in there and the coach
like, Hey, don't come out next half.

104
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,350
Right. You know, you just look, you know,
cause it was a Jv game and he's like,

105
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,080
you know, don't come out in the next
half and I'm gonna tell you something.

106
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,530
My dad seeing that I didn't come off
when we were warming up for a second half

107
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,700
and I mean he came in there and that
was not, that was not acceptable.

108
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:09,570
But one thing my dad taught me is you
start it, you finish it, check, check.

109
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,010
Now

110
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,640
what happened to that football
career? What'd you get? You get,

111
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,640
you did get some like legitimate injury,

112
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,450
right? Yeah, yeah. I
know. I got, I, you know,

113
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:21,110
I banged my knee up real bad on my
sophomore year between my sophomore and

114
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:25,340
junior year. Never really recovered
from it, you know. Um, and so,

115
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,760
I mean, I could've went
and played somewhere. Like,

116
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,050
I'm not going to still come nuggets here
and tell you I'd had full scholarships

117
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:32,640
or anything, but I could've, I
could've walked on somewhere, you know,

118
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,130
probably played outside linebacker or
you know, a strong safety. But, um,

119
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,240
you know, I just, I was going to go
play football and I had planned on that.

120
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,530
I had been through the clearinghouse.
I mean,

121
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:44,510
I'd done everything I needed
to do to go in and, you know,

122
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:48,190
my senior year and I just, and I ended
up going in the Marine Corps route. Okay.

123
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,130
Now I,
I've,

124
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,550
I've talked a few times down here about
the effectiveness of the Marine Corps

125
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,930
recruiting program, which they have
like the best recruiting numbers,

126
00:07:57,931 --> 00:07:59,850
but they spend the least on recruiting of,

127
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,460
of any of the military service branches.

128
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,190
And it sounds like you've
got rolled right into that.

129
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,730
I did. They got me, they got me. Let me
tell you something. They, uh, they got me,

130
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:14,680
you know, but, but I think, look, I, you
know, the products, the product with them,

131
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,540
right? Like, you know, you,
you know, you're either,

132
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,670
you're either going to be a marine or
you're not going to be a marine, right?

133
00:08:18,671 --> 00:08:21,700
Like you're, you either have it in here,
you don't like, it's not, you know,

134
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,060
they just, they just know how
to talk to their own. Right.

135
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,820
And I think that's what
they're so good at is,

136
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,600
is that they know how they know
what would have fired them up.

137
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,600
And so they say the same thing
that would have fired them up.

138
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,740
And if you buy it on it, then you're,
the type of person needs to be a marine.

139
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:40,060
And if you don't, they don't want
you anyway. You know what I mean?

140
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,750
Yeah, yeah. That's a
perfect way to put it.

141
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,860
And this is 2006 2006 2006 and again,
this is not my,

142
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:50,210
I always have to remind myself and I'll
remind everyone else while I'm at it, is,

143
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,110
you know,
when I joined the

144
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,950
eve in 1990 there was no war going on,

145
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,040
right? There was no war going on.
It was just, you know, peacetime.

146
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,080
And you're joining in 2006 where we're
award to different countries and 2006

147
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:09,030
things are not going well. They're a
little quiet in Afghanistan at that time.

148
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,450
But Iraq is full bore. I mean, that's
when I was in Ramadi and it was,

149
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,800
it was a real hard fighting was taking
place and on all on Bart province,

150
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,580
the rest of Iraq was pretty bad.
So, you know, for you, you know,

151
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,840
you're going and you know you're going
to go to combat. I mean, that's just like

152
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,320
kind of a given. Yeah, I mean I, um,

153
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,250
I don't know that I ever really
understood that though, until I was in,

154
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,640
you know what I mean? I think that, I
don't think it ever really hit me. Um,

155
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,280
I never really,
I didn't really join.

156
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,080
I can't sit here and give you some Modo
story that I joined to go, you know,

157
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,450
the advantage night 11 or you want
to hear something that's jacked up.

158
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,310
I joined in 1990 and I had the opposite
viewpoint, which is, I mean, you know,

159
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,990
there was no war going on, although
I'm not so sure I was going to war.

160
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,691
I was like,
oh,

161
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:51,300
it's all Sheila's got to be doing things
all over and doing stuff we don't even

162
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,780
hear about.
That's what my attitude is.

163
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,740
And here you were staring at
Duke War in two different,

164
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,620
two different zones and you're like,
I don't know if it will really happen.

165
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,480
I mean, honestly, I did. I know it sounds
dumb, but I mean like, I, you know,

166
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,920
by that time we're five years past it
and people had already got used to it.

167
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:12,150
Right. It was no longer
like, oh shit, you know, in,

168
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:15,480
in like the population, you know, in the,
you know, the average civilian. Right.

169
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,440
It wasn't, you know, cause
it, they've been doing it for
what, five years? Yeah. And,

170
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:23,120
um, so, you know, I didn't really think
about it and I, you know, I honestly,

171
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,000
you know, I joined a, I, you
know, I wanted to go infantry.
I wanted to fight. Um,

172
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,170
but I didn't really,

173
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,720
I don't think it ever really hit me
until I got into boot camp, you know?

174
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,750
And then I really started
understanding what,

175
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,040
and when you were going boot
through boot camp at that time,

176
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,640
basically every drill instructor must have
been coming back from the battlefield.

177
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,240
All of them. I mean, I'm telling
you, everybody, especially, uh,

178
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,690
especially in a school of infantry,

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,320
everyone of them had been, they were
shoes you. Yeah. I mean everyone,

180
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:53,460
I've been in the shit. Yeah.
You know, even my recruiter,

181
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,580
my recruiter had just got back
from Fallujah. Dang. Yeah.

182
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,030
And He'd been in the shit.
Dang.

183
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,340
Yeah. So with that, I'm going to take it
to the book right now because you know,

184
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,770
I think I was never in the Marine Corps.

185
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,710
I'm pretty sad about that sometimes.

186
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,730
But I have like read so much about the
Marine Corps over my life and be hung

187
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:18,770
around with so many marines
and work with bringing so much.

188
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,920
So whenever I get to Marine Corps
boot camp, it's like strikes.

189
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:26,921
A romantic side of me just wants
to at least get a little taste and,

190
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,920
and you did it really fast, which
is great. But here, here it isn't.

191
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,760
It's just like exactly what
we're going to the book again,

192
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:38,900
this book is into the fire by
Dakota Meyer and here we go.

193
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,350
So it began close haircuts to strip away
your old identity exercises to prove

194
00:11:45,711 --> 00:11:47,780
you're not half as strong as you figured,

195
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:50,450
simple tasks to show you
that you're mentally weak.

196
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,880
Drill instructors who mock your attempts
to look. It's right out of the movies,

197
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,080
but it never stops. And there
you go. You know what's coming.

198
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,560
How many times did you watch full metal
jacket before he went in a time? Yeah,

199
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:07,550
I mean I timed, you know exactly what's
going to happen. Does that even help? Uh,

200
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,200
no. It's just still, you
could, I mean you, you know,

201
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:15,400
like during bootcamp it was the
hardest thing I'd ever been through.

202
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,090
But when I look at everything I did in
the Marine Corps, it was the easiest.

203
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,930
That's the same thing with buds.
So first of all,

204
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:24,970
when I went through buds and I
didn't know anything about buds,

205
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,600
no one knew anything about buds in
1990 when I joined the Navy didn't know

206
00:12:28,601 --> 00:12:32,080
anything about it. And, and so I always
think that the guys are coming in now.

207
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,990
You can basically watch the entire bud.
You can watch the whole thing.

208
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:36,130
You know what, they, they,

209
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,390
the students eventually captured the
schedules and so they actually know what's

210
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:45,100
coming and you know, you know how many
people it keeps from quitting. None.

211
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,170
It's still the same attrition to,
okay,

212
00:12:47,171 --> 00:12:49,450
so it's going to suck really
bad and now you know it,

213
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:52,090
you didn't know it before you
even know when it's going to end.

214
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:57,360
You know what I mean?
Alright. Uh, back to the book.

215
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:00,910
The second month is the turnaround
when they build you back up.

216
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:03,010
Sergeant Brady made me a squad leader,

217
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,340
meaning he yelled at me for the
mistakes and the other 10 recruits,

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,500
that was all right. He had his job.
I had mine. You bust it through,

219
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:16,480
you get to graduation day, which was
obviously awesome. And then it's,

220
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,290
I spent the next two months
at Soi School of Infantry.

221
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:23,980
Only 15% of the marine corps and
the army are in the infantry.

222
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,210
In today's military there are more
combat pilots and infantry squad leaders.

223
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,080
Dang. Yeah. Ah, man, that's crazy.

224
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,630
15% of the marine corps and the army
are infantry troops for the ground.

225
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,690
That's,
that's an interesting figure in Vietnam.

226
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:43,720
And I was talking about this with life
and with actually the whole echelon front

227
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:47,200
team the other day, I had heard this
somewhere, I heard it from Hackworth,

228
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,600
that in Vietnam,
the height of the Vietnam War,

229
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:54,640
there was a little over 500,000 troops
on the ground and it was only 10% of

230
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:55,850
those troops that were,
you know,

231
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,340
infantry units that were on the
ground in combat. Yeah. You,

232
00:13:58,341 --> 00:14:01,540
you know what I find so interesting about
that fact and that stat when I looked

233
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,480
at it, you know, like I didn't understand
it obviously when I was in, but you know,

234
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,870
what I look at it is to understand
like how much it truly, you know, as,

235
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,120
as the war fighter,
you know,

236
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,220
I think we take for granted so many times
of what it really takes for us to be

237
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:16,720
able to do our job effectively. I mean,
you take it, I mean, it takes, you know,

238
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,870
85% of the organization just to
support that 15% to put you yes.

239
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,050
Face to face with the enemy.
There's gotta be another. Yeah.

240
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,320
I mean you look at it 10 to one 15 to
one or something like that. It's crazy.

241
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,070
Tend to one that's got to
put you up there. Yeah,

242
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,770
but that's what works and that's,
well here we go. Breaking down,

243
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,870
breaking down a little bit of
what the Marine Corps like.

244
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:40,240
A Marine squad is comprised of three,
four man fire teams.

245
00:14:40,241 --> 00:14:43,150
Everything you do as a rifleman
revolves around that four man team.

246
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:47,080
A one man carries a weapon more
powerful than those of the others,

247
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,390
but that's a minor point in the field.

248
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,360
You don't do anything without those
other guys. You don't shit sleep,

249
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,430
eat or move without the other
three knowing about it. Yeah.

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,120
A Marine squad with those three fire
teams is like a boxer with three arms,

251
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,560
one arm jabs with bursts of fire to
keep the opponent off balance while the

252
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:11,480
other arm loops around a left hook with
a third arm ready to follow up wherever

253
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:14,480
there's an opening. If one arm is
wounded, the other two can keep fighting.

254
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:18,560
Fire to pin down the enemy maneuver
to finish them off fire and maneuver,

255
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,800
fire maneuver, fire maneuver. And
I always have to point this out.

256
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,100
Extreme ownership, you
know, this is covering move.

257
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,840
This is what I was talking about.
The fundamental,

258
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,770
that's the fundamental gun fighting
tactic. Yes. Fire maneuver.

259
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,090
I was called a cover and move.

260
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,250
So you get done with Soi and

261
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,560
you head out to the Third
Marine regiment in Hawaii. Yeah.

262
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,770
That,
so how was that when you're checking in?

263
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,960
Oh yeah. Well we pulled in and as
soon as we pulled the bus in, the,

264
00:15:50,961 --> 00:15:53,180
uh, seniors, uh, you know, they're all,

265
00:15:53,181 --> 00:15:57,470
they had all just got back from a
hadith of the triad and I had a hard

266
00:15:57,471 --> 00:16:01,430
deployment. They got, they got the
shit kicked out of him. And uh,

267
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,480
and uh, so we pull in in a, you
know, there's no empathy there.

268
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,380
And so we pull in and they're throwing
beer bottles off the deck and they are

269
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:12,710
all hammered. It's in the middle
of the night. And um, you know,

270
00:16:12,711 --> 00:16:16,340
so it's like welcome, you know,
but it was awesome. You know,

271
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,380
I was honored to be out there.

272
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,890
And then how long did it take for the
sniper bill it to open up and for you to

273
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:26,220
get that? Yeah, so it was a, I think
it was like around February. Uh,

274
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,230
so I got there in
October. So September. No,

275
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,840
so I got there in October,
November. So November timeframe,

276
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,220
I think I got to why October,
November timeframe and then
I, it opened in January,

277
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:40,150
February timeframe. Hard to get a snack.
Isn't it hard to get a sniper built?

278
00:16:40,151 --> 00:16:42,950
Did you get lucky at need a new
guy get us Naperville. So I did.

279
00:16:42,951 --> 00:16:46,620
So I was actually the youngest sniper
in the Marine Corps in 2007. Um,

280
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,510
so what happened was,
is I had Brandon the Indoc,

281
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,680
so you have to run an Indoc
to be part of the platoon.

282
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,230
So you come in and then like
you, you, you're on probation,

283
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,890
so you run a huge Indoc, you come in and
you go on probation and then you start,

284
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,030
um,
you know,

285
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:02,030
usually you were go on deployment and
then after deployment you go to school.

286
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,451
Well,

287
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:06,170
they had a couple of schools so I had to
open up and a score and they basically

288
00:17:06,171 --> 00:17:09,470
gave me the option of you can either
go home on predeployment leave cause we

289
00:17:09,471 --> 00:17:10,304
were heading that rack.

290
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,060
You can either go and predeployment
leave or you can go to sniper school.

291
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,720
I was a 18 how many milliseconds did it
take you to make that decision? I said,

292
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,400
I said I've been with my family
for 18 years. I'm, I'm all good.

293
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,940
Oh man, that's awesome. And then
Marine Corps sniper school, uh,

294
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,420
that's a, that's a hardcore school
and 50% attrition rate. Yeah.

295
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,720
And seals in it with this. Yeah. And
then you know, our early seal snipers,

296
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,900
you know,
and I don't know the full,

297
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,280
I'll bring a sniper on here someday
that knows the whole history of the seal

298
00:17:42,281 --> 00:17:45,790
sniper program. But it's deeply rooted
in the Marine Corps sniper program.

299
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,511
Deeply rooted.

300
00:17:46,511 --> 00:17:49,470
Just like all of our training is
rooted in the Marine Corps and Raiders.

301
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:49,980
There's a lot

302
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,240
of crossover in those early days. But
Marine, the Marine Corps sniper program,

303
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,420
now everyone's going to think that's
a civilian's going to think like, oh,

304
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:00,330
you're sitting on a gun shooting. But,
but that's not really the hardest part.

305
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:05,210
Is it 5% of the job? Like it's
like the, it's, I would say, yeah,

306
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,560
I would say it's less than that,
you know, you know, I mean,

307
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:11,670
you gotta I mean the communication piece
of it, the mission planning, the, I mean,

308
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:16,610
there's so much, I mean, you, you
literally, you literally are the, uh,

309
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,560
you know, the commanders, the
battalion commander's trigger finger.

310
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,020
You guys do heavy stocking.
Right? That's just a gut check.

311
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:30,420
And how much did you weigh
at this point? Uh, probably
about 180. Okay. 85. And it's,

312
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:34,140
um, where do you guys do your
stocks? Uh, so we were in Hawaii,

313
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:37,560
so I went to Hawaii sniper school.
Okay. Um, and we do a mountain,

314
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:42,180
the cuckoo's out and just dripping
sweat. Oh, lane in, they're crawling.

315
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,050
Walking is terrible.

316
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,910
Scrawling for four hours
and going 35 meters. Yeah,

317
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:51,270
I mean, just like, you know, you know, you
start off, you got thousand meter lane,

318
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,141
you know,
and they're,

319
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:54,690
they put an observer up and they're
using the best glass there is.

320
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:59,670
And they're sitting on this truck and
a, you have to, you have to move up.

321
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,640
And, um, you got to
get within a, you know,

322
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,440
at a certain distance and whatever they
tell you. And then you get, you know,

323
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:10,410
you have to veg up and whatever you take
shot, you can do whatever you, you know,

324
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,320
you take a shot with a blank.
Okay.

325
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,530
And then they come over and so the,

326
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,940
the bigger walker on a walker on you
and then they try to walk, you know,

327
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,850
back and forth, they try to find you. If
they see you or anything, then you know,

328
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:27,900
you lose. Um, and then you got to take
a second shot. Wild. They're, you know,

329
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,600
cause that Walker gets within
the vicinity of you and like,

330
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,800
it's like 10 or 20 meters and then
you take a second shot and if they see

331
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:39,690
anything, then you know, you, you,
you, you failed too. So it's, you know,

332
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,600
yeah. And it's a walker. So basically
they bring a guy out who is like,

333
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,730
who you know has like a stick or something
and they can see them and then they

334
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:50,160
tried to say it so they go,
okay, I think I see him here.

335
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,430
So I need you to take left three
steps and then back four steps.

336
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,260
They tried to walk him on you.
Gotcha.

337
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,740
This will be interesting
when they get to you,

338
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,680
do they say sniper at your
feet to the guy? Huh? So yeah,

339
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,050
you have to say it sniper at your feet.

340
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,170
That's the same thing that they
say in the seal sniper school.

341
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,600
That's what they said to get
there. And they go, okay,
sniper your feet though. Yep.

342
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,230
Your boss. Did you fail?
Three, three steps left. Two
steps up. Sniper at your feet.

343
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,720
Yup. They'll say, nope. You know
what I mean? And so there's,

344
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,670
there's the crossover that
shows you that that's,

345
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,700
that stuff has rooted together and there's
a guy by the name of skin to who was

346
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,830
one of your instructors. You
were born your instructors,
right? Yeah. And here's a,

347
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,250
here's a,

348
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,970
going back to the book skin to told us
about a sniper team in an Overwatch and a

349
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:34,170
half constructed building in
Ramadi in 2004. It was a warm,

350
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:38,070
dull day and after several hours,
they dozed off and never awakened in.

351
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,160
Surgeon sneaked up and shot
all four marines in the head.

352
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,840
They left behind a high powered EMM 48
83 and it's excellent Schmidt and bender

353
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,130
scope.
Over

354
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,030
the course of the next year,

355
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:51,850
they allegedly killed two more Americans
before marine sniper took them out and

356
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:55,480
recovered the rifle.
Skint hammered home his message,

357
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,980
no every aspect of your job and never,
never let down your guard.

358
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,760
If you slack off or you take
things for granted, you die.

359
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,190
He, um, I, I had a lot. Look,

360
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:10,580
I was fortunate to have a lot of people
around me that influenced me. I mean, I'm,

361
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,340
I'm nothing special.
I'm the product of my environment and my,

362
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm direct reflection on my leadership.
I'm so fortunate,

363
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,430
but I'll tell you right now that when I
did that day was because of him was it

364
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,560
was because of the mentality that he
instilled in me. Um, knowing your job,

365
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,280
knowing it and obsessing with it and
knowing every aspect of it and no one

366
00:21:31,281 --> 00:21:32,810
everybody else's job around you.

367
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,790
And then when you know your job and
you know what's right you, you do that,

368
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,700
you don't worry about
what everybody else says.

369
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,030
Yeah. The, the, the noncommissioned
officers that, again,

370
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:48,260
they're same guys that raised me in
the seal teams have such a huge impact.

371
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,310
And what,

372
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,330
what I also found interesting about
this was this story about the snipers.

373
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,000
When I got to Ramadi in 2006, we heard
this exact story and you know, it,

374
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,500
it was another thing that made us more
paranoid and made my guys more paranoid

375
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:05,360
being out there. And we
actually had thought, I didn't,

376
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,990
this has 2004 we thought it happened
a little bit later and closer to our

377
00:22:08,991 --> 00:22:13,690
deployment. But um, yeah, man,
just a, just a nightmare. Yeah.

378
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,023
Yeah.

379
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,150
Another little commentary from you here
back to the book shooting another human

380
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:21,500
being was a math problem.

381
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:27,120
You are either right or wrong with no
subjective in between decided by someone

382
00:22:27,141 --> 00:22:27,920
else.

383
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,550
I liked problems that were black and white
life or death before taking a shot at

384
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,350
a target 1000 meters away,

385
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:37,910
you had to calculate the effects
of the light air at altitude, wind,

386
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:40,850
humidity, angle of fire,
cartridge velocity and gravity.

387
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,760
You had to align the target, the
background of the terrain, the weather,

388
00:22:43,761 --> 00:22:46,490
the noise and the weapon.
You had to work in concert with others.

389
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,820
At the same time, the target enemy
was figuring out how to kill you.

390
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,070
Combat was a zero sum making
played for the highest stakes,

391
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:56,743
live or die.

392
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,630
And the 31 people started the course
and 13 people graduated so that,

393
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:10,481
that should tell everyone why that sniper
designation is so damn hard to get it

394
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,630
cause it's no joke. And there's usually
at any point in time there's not.

395
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,140
There's usually around 300 school trained
snipers in the Marine Corps to anytime

396
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,120
really? Dang. Oh, that's in my task unit,

397
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,070
which is about 40 seals. We had
13 snipers. It was so awesome.

398
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,020
Yellows killers got lucky. You know,
I got lucky that the stars aligned.

399
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:38,090
Okay, so now you're trained up
and then in 2007, you deploy,

400
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,560
you deployed to Iraq? I did
first deployment. How pumped
palm you. I was pumped.

401
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:46,040
I have and I just, I just got out
of school trained man, you know, I'm

402
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,520
ready to go. I'm ready to go
turn the heat up. Right. And um,

403
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,840
and where we were going was actually a
bad spot. I mean we were in Karma. Yup.

404
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,800
And uh, it, it had, it had been bad,

405
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:59,180
but it was like we were part of that
search and uh, when we got there,

406
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:04,010
we took some contact once and
I just like to waterfalls.

407
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:07,880
It turned off, you go from streets
that you're fighting down to.

408
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,710
Next thing you know, I mean, you
could walk out with no gear. It's,

409
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,030
what were you guys doing? Just doing
patrols? We were doing a lot of dwell ops,

410
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,610
which is what we'd go out
basically what they were, the,

411
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:20,330
the theory on this was we would go out
off the farm and stay like four or five

412
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:25,250
days in a house and you know, um, you
know, we would get hit by indirect fire,

413
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,620
uh, you know, some, but I mean,

414
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,600
but I was only there for like 45 days
and then you got hit in the hand would go

415
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,400
what I got,
I got bid on the right hand,

416
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,210
my right hand by a spider and a
actually suffered severe nerve damage.

417
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,740
Lost the movement in my last three
fingers and a big chasm act you for this?

418
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,900
Yeah. Or medivaced you
back to Germany. Yeah.

419
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,680
So they send me to Al-assad and tried
to fix it there. I did. I, they,

420
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,620
they rushed me and I had two surgeries
and can't flew gia. And then, um, they,

421
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,460
they moved me to outside and they sent
me back to Germany and I was there for

422
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:59,720
like 25 days in the hospital in
Germany to save your hand basically.

423
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,660
And then they sent me home and then I
was having to do occupational therapy to

424
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:05,270
get, you know, to get my fingers
back. They wouldn't move, you know?

425
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:10,490
When were you back in Kentucky?
No, I was back at Hawaii.

426
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,290
Hawaii in my unit.
And,

427
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,790
but you did have a little bit of Kentucky
with you there in the form of Bourbon?

428
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:19,310
Yeah. Yeah. A lot of it. I was drinking.

429
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,370
How's the drinking started getting
after it a little bit. I did.

430
00:25:22,371 --> 00:25:25,280
And even a little bit too much. Yeah.
Too much. You know, I started, you know,

431
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:25,731
it was hard.

432
00:25:25,731 --> 00:25:28,670
It was hard coming home and knowing my
teammates were still over there and no

433
00:25:28,671 --> 00:25:31,160
one that, my unit was still there
and I wasn't part of it, you know?

434
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,430
And then did you go,

435
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,890
did you have to go back or you came back
to states like on leave? Uh, no. No.

436
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,080
After you were, after your hand
was hurt. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

437
00:25:42,081 --> 00:25:43,990
So I came back to Kentucky Grata.

438
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,540
And you hung out there for awhile and
actually lost a couple friends at that

439
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:51,600
time. I did it. I did cause she was
tragical tragic situations. Yeah,

440
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,740
it was terrible. You know, I had a guy,
the guy, you know, actually his, you know,

441
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:57,180
his name is on my chest and um,
he,

442
00:25:57,181 --> 00:26:01,550
we played football together and uh,
he had called me,

443
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:05,480
I was leaving the hospital and I was
coming home that weekend and he had called

444
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,040
me, he had called me right before I was
on the way to the hospital and said, hey,

445
00:26:09,041 --> 00:26:10,710
you, hey man, we're going to go
to this football game. You know,

446
00:26:10,711 --> 00:26:13,040
we're going to watch my little
brother play, you know, all of that.

447
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,160
And I got a call as soon as I was
leaving the hospital and he had, um,

448
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,460
he'd had a wreck and got killed. Yeah.
Close, close friend. Then I lost a,

449
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,570
um, another friend she got, she
got killed in December. Um, not,

450
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,290
not exactly what you want to go home or
leave for, man. That's harsh. No, no, no.

451
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:34,590
But you know, it's, it's just the way,
the way it goes. You know, they're in,

452
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,800
and then you say you spend that time at
home, you go back, you rejoin your return.

453
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:40,400
And this is when you find out that
they want volunteers to go help out in

454
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:44,360
Afghanistan. Yeah. So we built up weed. I
was back probably a year, year and a half,

455
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,160
went to mountain sniper
school. And, um, you know,

456
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:51,260
I became in charge of my own team, um,
but got married til he actually promoted.

457
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,450
Um, I was, you know, I
was a lance corporal lead,

458
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,350
a five man team with a sergeant on
it, you know, and uh, you know, I, uh,

459
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,590
ended up taking, like I had the worst,
like I got like the newest guys,

460
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:03,810
they gave me the newest guys and uh,

461
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,900
we ended up being the
general support team.

462
00:27:06,901 --> 00:27:10,000
So we moved all the way up to the
platoon and ended up being, you know,

463
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:13,800
one of the best, one of the best
teams. And I'm stern and um, yeah,

464
00:27:13,801 --> 00:27:17,070
so we're out at 29 palms doing her
final train up to go back to Iraq.

465
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,140
And this was when nothing
was going on in 2009. I mean,

466
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:22,560
they weren't letting you leave the
wire. Right. And, uh, we had no mission,

467
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:26,910
so it kind of sucked. Right. And, uh, they
came and said, we need five volunteers,

468
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,570
go to Afghanistan. And I said, what's
the mission? I said, we don't know,

469
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:33,540
but we just need five bodies. And
I raised my hand, said, yeah, I'm,

470
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,810
I'm ready to go again.
Like how many milliseconds?

471
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:40,980
Zero. That decision. And so that
what you were volunteering for,

472
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:44,610
you find out later is, is, uh, embedded
training team and advisory teams.

473
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:47,850
Know what that's all about. So an embedded
training team is where they take a,

474
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:48,031
you know,

475
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:51,330
they take different ranks and different
skillsets of marines and they put them

476
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:52,440
or you know, whatever, you know,

477
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:57,030
military unit and they put them together
and they embed them with a, you know,

478
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,100
a, an Afghan unit. So we were embedded
with the Ade Afghan's a whole, not a,

479
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,950
it was a company. And so
that's, that's, we just lived,

480
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:11,610
we did everything with them.
We did everything from, you
know, teach them weapons,

481
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:16,380
tactics and, and uh, you know,
um, shooting, shooting. We,

482
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,930
I did the change over for
the NATO weapons, right?

483
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:21,780
So we took them from cause
Soviet to the natal weapons.

484
00:28:21,781 --> 00:28:24,510
And that's another key factor that we
need to bring up to talk about and that

485
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,040
gunfight. Um, so we were teaching them
on that call and them all and that,

486
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,510
you know, everything from
everything. I mean, we,

487
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,450
we did everything with these guys cause,
and then could you,

488
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,900
did you do any kind of work
up before you went over? Yeah.

489
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:39,330
So we that was it with that team.
Yeah.

490
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:41,700
Your actual team that you were
gonna deploy with. Yeah. So we did,

491
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:44,370
we did a workup with them.
Actually, no, I just left 29 palms.

492
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:48,510
I go back and we trained for
like a month or two in Okinawa,

493
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:50,100
Japan with this new team.

494
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,900
And then we head back to 29 palms and
then we go from, well we went back,

495
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,270
so he went to Bridgeport and
then we came down 29 palms.

496
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:01,110
We did all our mountain stuff
at Bridgeport, um, all our
mules and all that stuff,

497
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:02,490
you know, pack. And then, uh,

498
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:06,780
we came down and did it ended in
29 palms and then we headed over.

499
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,370
And that was with that four man team?
Yeah. With a Lieutenant Johnson,

500
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,700
gunny Kenefick,
um,

501
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,450
and doc late and myself and we'll talk
about those guys a little bit here in the

502
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:23,160
book. We've done it, Mike
Johnson's Forman team at Monte.

503
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:25,230
This is where you end
up place called Monte,

504
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,530
which is 10 miles worth north
of another fob called Joyce,

505
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,740
Lieutenant Johnson Sani and smiling
with an easy laugh but completely

506
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:36,690
professional with the highest standards.

507
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,900
I'd climbed mountains with
him in California of course,

508
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:42,100
and I knew he was a strong
physically as he was

509
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,933
mentally.

510
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Staff Sergeant Aaron Kenefick was a
personnel specialist with eight years

511
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:50,200
expertise in administration.

512
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,550
So his job was to bring some order to
the Afghan personnel procedures and pre

513
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,120
pay records.
Doc Leighton are corpsman,

514
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,210
would provide some basic medical
care to the Afghans and the villages,

515
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:04,870
but it's primary job was to be ready
in case any advisors or Afghan soldiers

516
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:05,704
were wounded.

517
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,630
I had a job to lieutenant Johnson put
me in charge of tactics operations in

518
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:15,220
weapons training before each patrol I
approved of the Afghan scheme of maneuver,

519
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,810
inspected the radios and guns,

520
00:30:16,811 --> 00:30:20,020
coordinated fire support and
planned and emergency escape route.

521
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,650
This was far easier than planning the
sniper missions I had been trained for.

522
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,140
So you,
you were,

523
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,260
you were kind of the most tactically
savvy guy in the group Vena sniper already

524
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,190
deployed to Iraq.

525
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,950
Yeah, no, I was, and you don't want,

526
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:38,800
and what will prepare me was my training
that I deal with my team. Um, you know,

527
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:42,160
my sniper team. I mean, look, I, I,
you know, people thought I was crazy.

528
00:30:42,161 --> 00:30:44,980
They thought I was crazy the way that
I was training in my platoon before.

529
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:46,720
You're like, we're going to Iraq,
we're not gonna do anything. I'm like,

530
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,970
I don't give a shit. Right?
Like, I'm, I was still learning,

531
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:51,070
tack sat and I was still learning,
you know,

532
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,890
Satcom and I was still learning and HF
and I was still learning how to low crypt.

533
00:30:54,891 --> 00:30:57,460
I mean, I wanted to know every
aspect of every part of the job.

534
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:01,230
I was learning every, I was going over
to the, to the Bas and learning, uh,

535
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,910
you know, all the medical stuff
that I could, and I was, you know,

536
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,230
I mean everything I could do,

537
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,680
like if I could get just a little nugget
in knowledge and better myself in every

538
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:11,560
aspect that was doing
it. And, um, so yeah.

539
00:31:11,561 --> 00:31:15,790
So when I got over to this
team, I mean, you know, I,

540
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:20,920
I was the only tactical guy in there,
you know,

541
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,840
and, uh, yeah. And it was, you know, they,
they were, when it came to the tactics,

542
00:31:25,841 --> 00:31:27,940
when it came to making sure
that the weapons were ready,

543
00:31:27,941 --> 00:31:31,120
when it came to making sure
that the vehicles are ready,
that, that the, that the,

544
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:33,910
you know, that, uh, the jammers,
we're working that, you know,

545
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,530
if anything that mattered in the
patrol, it was on me, on you. Yeah.

546
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,730
That trucks were loaded.

547
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:44,720
And the reason that the Marine Corps put
the teams together like this is because,

548
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:50,090
well, that they're trying to develop the
whole Afghan army, every aspect of it,

549
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:53,360
not just the tactical side,
but they want like the administration.

550
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:55,860
So that the people can start getting
paid on time and the organization,

551
00:31:55,861 --> 00:31:58,400
so they got the lieutenant in there and
at the same time they want to help the

552
00:31:58,401 --> 00:32:01,100
villagers. So they put a corpsman
in there. So do medical work.

553
00:32:01,101 --> 00:32:03,350
So that's kind of just a name.
If everyone's thinking,

554
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:04,850
why the hell would you put
together a team like that?

555
00:32:04,851 --> 00:32:07,340
It's because the people that are
supposed to do the fighting are actually

556
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:09,750
supposed to be the Afghans.
Right? Yes. And, and,

557
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,770
and the team is there to support them,
help them train them, and get them ready.

558
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,530
Yeah. And that's, that's the
mind. That's the theory, right?

559
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,510
The theory is that you train,

560
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:23,100
you train them and they do the fighting
and you're just there to advise them.

561
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,410
Right. Um, but it never was works

562
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,300
that way. It does. It didn't
work that way in Iraq. And,

563
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:31,070
and one of the things that I pointed
out many times was, you know,

564
00:32:31,071 --> 00:32:34,490
what kind of your you want to develop a
relationship with, with a group, right?

565
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,950
And, and now you say, okay,
we're going to train you,

566
00:32:36,951 --> 00:32:39,860
but when it come time to do something
dangerous, you guys go by yourselves.

567
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,780
That's not, you're not building
a relationship. You're,

568
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,100
you're in fact you're going backwards.
No. Yeah, it's the same way. Oh,

569
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,800
so you get there and you start doing,

570
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,100
you're just kinda going on patrols
to going on patrols with the,

571
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:54,740
with the Afghan army company.

572
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,870
It was kind of interesting,
you know,

573
00:32:55,871 --> 00:32:57,880
cause I was kind of the high
strung one on the team. You know,

574
00:32:57,881 --> 00:33:01,390
like I was like the one that always was,
you know, we need to be ready to fight.

575
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,150
You know, I don't know how many arguments
I got into with some of the, the,

576
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:08,110
the leadership in teams, you know,
cause we, we were 21 man team,

577
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,340
but we were broken into four main
elements and spread out, you know, in,

578
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:11,174
in this area.

579
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,230
And I don't know how many times I got into
arguments with people and the team of,

580
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:17,050
you know, hey, this is how we need to do
it. We need to stay up. I mean, I was,

581
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:19,480
I was trying to train them, I
was doing stuff of, you know,

582
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:22,240
trying to train them to do ivs at
night with nods. And they're like,

583
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:23,650
why the hell are we doing this?
You know what I mean?

584
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,450
Like in a lot of people look down
on it and, uh, and, and I said,

585
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:31,720
I'm going to prepare to fight. And they
said, you know, we're not, you know,

586
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:34,690
they saw many times leadership got on me.
We're not going over there to fight.

587
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:39,490
We're going to advise.
And that was the mindset of a lot of this,

588
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,760
and I'm not gonna say my team,
but a lot of the team and uh,

589
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,990
and it showed, yeah, yeah. You know,
for everyone out there, that's it.

590
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,610
Wearing a uniform right now,
man.

591
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,470
Be ready for the worst case scenario
all the time. You're not ready for it.

592
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,900
You know what I tell him he is?
I said, you know, Lieutenant
Johnson was, uh, was a,

593
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,490
a calm guy,
satellite guy,

594
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,380
doc late and was a blue side Korman
and gunny Kenefick was an s one guy,

595
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:10,950
you know, and I always wonder, do you
think that they ever thought they'd be,

596
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:13,150
and one of the deadliest
battles in Afghanistan,

597
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,010
do you think they ever
thought they didn't?

598
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,590
You know, you don't know
where you're going to be at,

599
00:34:17,591 --> 00:34:20,890
but one day you're going to be
tested. Yeah, you better be ready.

600
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,730
So you guys are rolling
out on these patrols.

601
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,350
Here's a good kind of aspect of
what you see on those patrols.

602
00:34:29,351 --> 00:34:32,530
And you called the army.
The Afghan army soldiers ask ours.

603
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,350
Am I saying that other call? NASCARS
nascars all right, here we go.

604
00:34:35,351 --> 00:34:37,570
Back to the book.
When we walked into some hamlets,

605
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,350
you could feel something was wrong.
When kids threw rocks at you,

606
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,230
you knew what the parents
were telling them.

607
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,510
Sometimes the ass cars grabbed the
kids soccer balls and slice them apart.

608
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,380
This didn't win any hearts and minds,
but it did stop the rocks.

609
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,600
Whenever the elders hurried through the
ceremonial tea though I'd watch the ass

610
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,090
cars when any soldier senses danger.

611
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,360
He crouches down a few inches to make
himself less of a target when the ass cars

612
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:11,520
did that. I went on full alert
Hafez ms saying that right? Yeah.

613
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:14,800
So his name is [inaudible] so I had
named him Hafez in that to protect him.

614
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,170
Got It. He's how he's here in
America now. Okay. We're good.

615
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,450
Hafez was our lead interpreter and we
quickly learned our best warning system at

616
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,140
a 37 year old sergeant major
retired from the Afghan army.

617
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,120
Hafez had served in Kuhner for
three years with advisor teams.

618
00:35:31,121 --> 00:35:35,110
The Afghan soldiers distrusted him
because he refused to support their never

619
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:39,870
ending schemes to skim off the Americans.
So he's your, your most trusted advisor.

620
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,030
Interesting that you point out how when,
when soldiers sense danger.

621
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,230
And I was telling you about JP,

622
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:49,800
my lead sniper and one of my
two platoons and t you bruiser.

623
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,970
And when he came on the podcast, I'd
described him walking through the streets.

624
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,280
And you and I, because
like I told you, man,

625
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:59,910
I don't think JP was going to live
because JP was too brave for his own damn

626
00:35:59,911 --> 00:36:03,060
good. But when I'd, you know,
I'd, I'd be watching, I'd be like,

627
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,930
like holding security and watching
patrol go and you'd see, you know,

628
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,930
I'd see guys moving with that little
crouch cause everyone's expecting that the

629
00:36:09,931 --> 00:36:10,800
shooting's going to start.

630
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,430
And I'd see JP man walking with
his head up and his chest out,

631
00:36:14,431 --> 00:36:18,500
like ready to get something.
It's nice to be 23 years old.

632
00:36:18,501 --> 00:36:22,630
I'm not that you could die.
So that's my brother Jake.

633
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,590
And the other thing that, you know,
when you're in these foreign countries,

634
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:31,380
when we were in Iraq and Afghanistan,
the locals,

635
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:33,050
we can't tell the difference between it.

636
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,920
We really can't tell a difference
between a good buy in a bag.

637
00:36:34,921 --> 00:36:37,530
I now you learned some sense
of it where you go, okay,

638
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:39,990
that guy looks shady and you're,
you're probably pretty accurate.

639
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,520
But the a guy let cuff Hafez, you get
to know, you can get to know instantly.

640
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,350
He was the unofficial fifth member
of our team inside of Hamlet.

641
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,460
If he shook his head at us, we knew it
was time to forget the tea and get out.

642
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:57,300
So w how much good,
how much,

643
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,420
how often would you go into a handle it
and the people were cool and all good

644
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:03,480
and drinking tea and you know, most
of the time, I mean most of them look,

645
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:07,890
I mean look, I, you know, the
people there want it to be better.

646
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,860
I mean they live in the shift. Yeah. They
live there. They want it to be better.

647
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:13,560
You know, they're just caught in a
bad situation. It's not a, it's not a,

648
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,080
it's not a simple equation.
You know,

649
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,890
there's nothing simple about
the life that they have to live.

650
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,780
You made some friends going back to the
book in the hills along the Pakistani

651
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:27,870
border. No Afghan military or
civilian had much of anything.

652
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,650
I think practically every American
soldier marine tried to help in some way.

653
00:37:31,651 --> 00:37:35,010
We purchase candy and trinkets
in the markets to give the kids,

654
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:40,280
I assume had two little buddies boys
about 10 or 11 they'd hang around the main

655
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,960
gate. Jaelyn my e. Dot. A. Dot.

656
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,870
Trying to say your name
when they saw me at first,

657
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:49,590
I buy him cokes and then started sharing
my care packages from home soap, candy,

658
00:37:49,591 --> 00:37:52,860
peanuts,
gone gum maybe a decade from now.

659
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,580
Some kids remember that some Americans
were kind to them even when they're older

660
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,890
brothers were shooting at them.
Maybe not.

661
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,260
You don't help out because you expect
something in return. So you're,

662
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,400
you're a human being man. Trying to try
to take care of some kids a lot there.

663
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:10,783
Um,

664
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,710
I think this is getting into
your first sort of legit,

665
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,350
we'll call it combat and a,
you're taking some small arms fire.

666
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,400
I'm going to the book here.

667
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:28,410
Staff sergeant can affect was standing
outside a bunker about 100 feet from me.

668
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:32,070
Meyer, we're under attack. He yelled
technically, yes, but the shepherd,

669
00:38:32,071 --> 00:38:33,060
there's some shepherd out there,

670
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,410
but the shepherd was shooting
without poking his head up to aim.

671
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,790
He had one chance in a thousand of hitting
us, a second harmless, harmless burst,

672
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:43,570
followed the bullets cracking more than
10 feet above our head call for already.

673
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,270
Now staff sergeant can
affect yelled holding.

674
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:50,950
The radio had a headset out towards me.
Oh Nice staff sergeant.

675
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:54,940
Soon to be Gunnery Sergeant Kaktovik
needed the lowly corporals help.

676
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,090
I trotted towards him.
Stopped, assumed parade.

677
00:38:58,091 --> 00:39:01,180
Rest postures aren't locked
behind my back chest.

678
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:05,710
Push forward in the wide open and pasted
to respectful expression on my face.

679
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,680
What does the staff sergeant
wish the corporal to do?
Another burst from the Aka.

680
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,700
This is no time to be a smart ass Meyer.
A few more rounds. Still way too high.

681
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,280
I'm locked at parade rest.
I staff sergeant,

682
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:22,180
he balanced the headset considering
whether to throw it at me. Meyer hurry up.

683
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,800
He had started calling in the artillery
mission and when I got to him he was

684
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,300
asking me,
what do I say now?

685
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,170
Left 100 drop 200 I said he
repeated it on the radio. What now?

686
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:36,500
He asked fire for effect. I said, should
be dead on. Okay. Fire for effect.

687
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,600
He repeated over the radio
and that's it.

688
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:44,920
You hit the guy. But
uh, it's funny that you,

689
00:39:44,921 --> 00:39:46,880
even in that situation,
um,

690
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,270
you were talking about being kind
of a wise ass when you're a kid,

691
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,740
you're still a wise ass.

692
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,320
Yeah. You know the thing
about Ken, if Duke was,

693
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,940
me and him were butting heads
real hard at that time, you know,

694
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,990
we were butting heads. Um, you know how
some people would just take over. Like he,

695
00:39:59,991 --> 00:40:03,430
he, he took over and tried to
make up for his lack of, you know,

696
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:06,340
nothing against him. And he wasn't
a combat. I mean it wasn't his job,

697
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:10,240
but what he tried to make up for in the
lack of his combat knowledge was his

698
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,610
authority. Right. And so, you know, he,

699
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:17,200
he had kind of pissed me off pretty bad
about, you know, asking me to do you,

700
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:19,830
can you stand at parade rest?
Like he was all big on it. Right.

701
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:23,860
And it's like we're on, we're on a
cop. Like, you know, we, you know,

702
00:40:23,861 --> 00:40:26,440
you still need it, but you know,
customs and courtesies, right? Yeah.

703
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,710
And so I used that, that situation
to make a point, you know,

704
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:33,280
he just kind of pushed me over the
edge and then, but after that we,

705
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,570
yeah, that's kind of broad. You broke
us all, you know. That's awesome. Great.

706
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,660
You had some good Afghan
soldiers and under,

707
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,060
you were talking to me about them early.
One guy by the name of dawn Ali.

708
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,160
Here you go. He was fun to talk
to, open, friendly and fearless.

709
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,350
We'd sit around talking and
asking questions of each other.

710
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,900
Like kids in middle school learning
as much as we could about each other.

711
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,620
He proudly cleaned his soft five times
a day and absorbed every tip I gave him

712
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,530
about shooting. He was the most
disciplined ask are on base.

713
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,660
That's why we gave him the
salt in the first place.

714
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,400
She had good relationship with that.

715
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,740
Yeah, I mean I had a good relationship
with all my Afghans. I mean I,

716
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,290
I I at least two meals a
day with them. Um, you know,

717
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:14,600
usually I didn't eat breakfast with
them. I would eat it over at the, uh,

718
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,400
over at the, uh, you know, the Chow
Hall. But I used, you know, that was my,

719
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,890
that was my policy. I mean, every
night I ate dinner with them,

720
00:41:21,891 --> 00:41:26,390
every single night I would eat dinner
with my Afghan soldiers because I was no

721
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:27,224
better than them.

722
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,170
You know, sometimes I hear,
I hear people, you know,

723
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,090
people that don't understand all what
was going on in Iraq or Afghanistan,

724
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,250
they'll, you know, you,
you, we were occupied.

725
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,610
America was occupiers
and how could you do it?

726
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:44,120
And it's like I always remind them like
we were fighting alongside the Iraqi

727
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:48,690
soldiers fighting alongside the Afghan
soldiers. I mean, spilling blood. Yeah.

728
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,410
I mean, we weren't, I mean, just
cause it was Iraq and Afghanistan war.

729
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,010
We weren't fighting Iraq and Afghanistan.
We were fighting with them.

730
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,210
We weren't fighting against
Iraq or Afghanistan. We
were fighting next to them.

731
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,430
You know, we were helping them
against the same enemy. You know,

732
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,140
so many people miss that
point, man. And his feeds up.

733
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,420
It's an important point to be
missed. It's a big, it's a big fat

734
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,500
man. I hear that. And it just
turns my stomach man. Um,

735
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,470
now I kind of joked about that,

736
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,160
that first situation being your first
combat and now you had legit your first

737
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:23,390
kind of trial by fire.

738
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,870
You're at combat because you're at the
outpost at Cop Monte and you're under

739
00:42:29,871 --> 00:42:34,330
attack. You actually got some wounded,
some ass cars are wounded and you're here.

740
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:37,130
We're going back to book.
Where's dad? Where's staff
sergeant can affect? I yelled,

741
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,110
doc late and pointed toward
the North East Tower.

742
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:40,640
Get over there and stay with him.
I yelled,

743
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,110
suicide bombers sometimes rush the wire
trying to take an take an infidel with

744
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:49,370
them as they evaporated in a red flash
without hesitating doc late and ran down

745
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:52,700
the stairs across the open space and into
the tower with Staff Sergeant Kenefick.

746
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,750
Two or three seconds later or
rocket slammed into their bunker,

747
00:42:56,751 --> 00:43:01,310
exploding into pieces and Afghan
worker huddled there behind beside the

748
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,790
sandbags, smoke rolled out
of the tower. They're gone.

749
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,600
I yelled to Johnson not believing what
I had just seen. I resumed firing.

750
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:13,310
It's all you can do. The best first
aid at that point was to return fire.

751
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,150
Johnson worked the radio,
Fox three one fox. We won.

752
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:20,840
This is Fox three staff sergeant can
affect doc late and come on answer up.

753
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,460
We kept firing, but it seemed
unworldly. Now we were on automatic.

754
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:30,020
Lieutenant Johnson got on the radio again.
Three one fox three one. This is Fox.

755
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:32,930
Three staffs aren't in. Can
Effect Dot Leighton. Come on, man.

756
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,410
Answer up then finally. Yeah. Yeah.

757
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,270
This is three one we're good. 10 minutes
later or attack helicopters began.

758
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:45,080
Strafing runs low rumbling
burrs like a giant burping,

759
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,010
incredible fire power. Those lovely
birds and to me, fire ceased.

760
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,420
Attack over Johnson and
I ran over to the bunker.

761
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,830
A Staff Sergeant Kenefick and
doc late and stumbled out.

762
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:58,940
The four of us sat on the bloody sandbags
and the growing dust talking about it.

763
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:02,840
Their eyes were slightly glazed and wide,
wide open.

764
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,560
Lieutenant John Johnson,

765
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:08,030
staff sergeant can affect doc and
doc Leighton weren't infantry.

766
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,450
They had considered that by coming
to Afghanistan they might die,

767
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,580
but it hadn't kicked in until now.

768
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,410
Now they had heard the screams and
seeing the blood. Everybody suit covered.

769
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:22,550
Understood. Now that if we went home
together, it might not be alive.

770
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:25,190
The ass cars were cleaning
up the bloody mess,

771
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:28,910
not six feet from us taking away the rip,
the body of their friend.

772
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,040
We mumbled some stuff.
All of us

773
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,930
were too embarrassed to
talk about our feelings,

774
00:44:33,931 --> 00:44:38,250
but we knew what we were all thinking
this shit was for real and there were only

775
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:42,360
four of us will be there for
each other doc late and said,

776
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,880
the surfer dude surprised me.

777
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,600
He had said the one thing
that made any sense.

778
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,280
Yeah, that was, um,

779
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,310
yeah,

780
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,940
that was the Sunday before.
Uh,

781
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:02,430
so ganja gold was on a,
on a Tuesday.

782
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,760
That was September 6th of
2009 is a huge rocket attack.

783
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:09,720
I mean, they were dialed
in. It was terrible.

784
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,740
Like I can remember it as if I was there.
It was terrible.

785
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,490
How many rocks they fire. Oh, I
think we had nine that hit that one.

786
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:22,410
Oh seventh did hit dead on like in not
just nine. That hit just inside of,

787
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,940
of, not the whole base,
but just my Afghan base.

788
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,230
It's probably this,
you know,

789
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,520
where we're at right now is probably
bigger than that. He was terrible.

790
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,050
And that was a wake up call. Oh,
it was for all of us. I mean,

791
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,040
it was for all of us and it was for them.
And I, you know, I'll never forget, um,

792
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:44,830
yeah.

793
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,340
You know, I'll never forget talk. I mean,

794
00:45:46,341 --> 00:45:48,860
we finally sat down and talked about
what do we do if we lose one of it,

795
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:53,840
you know, what do we want?
And, um, gosh, it was so real.

796
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,910
And you know, I'll never forget
Kenefick I had, um, I had met a,

797
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,600
backed out a guy, oh, the
wounded soldier that day. Um,

798
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,650
and he was putting me in for a bronze
star and I'll never forget he was walking

799
00:46:08,721 --> 00:46:13,040
through in the, um, in the
little hooch and he said, uh,

800
00:46:13,041 --> 00:46:15,320
and where we lived at.
And he was just, you know,

801
00:46:15,321 --> 00:46:17,990
kind of joking a little bit later on that
day. He's like, hell Meyer, you know,

802
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:21,680
the way shit's going for you. And
it's unlucky as you are. He goes,

803
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:25,130
you'll probably be in for a medal of
honor before this deployments over with.

804
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,430
Huh. And, uh,

805
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,430
it's his crazy.
Yeah.

806
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,840
So that's two days before you
guys head down to Ganja Gall.

807
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,710
We'd actually got the call that night
that we were supposed to go to Ganja Gall

808
00:46:38,711 --> 00:46:42,710
and the seventh and uh, they ended
up pushing it right to the eighth.

809
00:46:44,270 --> 00:46:48,320
So we left the next day. We talk a lot
about it a little bit here. Ganja Gall,

810
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:52,430
late two miles north of joy. So we
drove right by the mouth of the valley.

811
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,900
Ganja gall sounded like the name of an
Irish town full of smiling faces and

812
00:46:56,901 --> 00:46:57,890
friendly pubs.

813
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,940
I could see a few of the larger
compounds far back on a hillside,

814
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,840
nestled against steep ridge lines,
bad place,

815
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:09,860
half as muttered bad people. So
you're getting right away. Get,

816
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:15,520
I mean, we were told instantly. I mean, we
were told like, I mean we, I mean, yeah,

817
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:16,443
there was no doubt.

818
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,860
Now one thing that I think
made you feel more calm,

819
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,110
a little bit more comfortable.
You talk about in the book,

820
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,490
historically the Taliban had not
sprung ambushes from inside villages.

821
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,980
So that wasn't discussed at the briefing.
Plus we were going in

822
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,980
with 90 Afghans and 15 advisors with a
platoon from one three to deployed behind

823
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:38,560
us in a quick reaction force.
This shows us,

824
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,040
this show belongs to the, to
our Afghan counterparts. Fabio.

825
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:44,470
Am I saying that right? Yeah, Fabio.

826
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,450
Fabio said we advisers will stand off
to the side and let them talk with the

827
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:53,440
elders were not in the lead. We're
assisting. That made no sense.

828
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:56,680
I thought considering who is doing
the briefing and who is hearing yet.

829
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,340
We were in the tactical lead
even if we claimed otherwise.

830
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,010
That's what a little point.
But that's a political thing.

831
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,360
Um, yeah, I mean I, I think
it's an ignorance thing. Well,

832
00:48:08,361 --> 00:48:10,840
I think it's an ignorant thing too,
but the reason it happened. No, no, no,

833
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:12,980
of course.
I mean technically we fail under,

834
00:48:12,981 --> 00:48:15,740
so I mean technically
the way that this works,

835
00:48:15,741 --> 00:48:19,970
it's crazy as this sounds I was working
for like my commander was Afghan

836
00:48:19,971 --> 00:48:23,450
commander, whatever the Afghan commander
told me was what I was supposed to do.

837
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,440
Right. I mean, I'm saying
that's a political thing for
us to say politically, look,

838
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:30,680
the Afghans are running this operation.
Yes, yes, yes. I mean that, you know,

839
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:35,240
but that, um, if you remember what I said
a little bit earlier about, you know, hey,

840
00:48:35,241 --> 00:48:37,560
we're not going to do the
fighting. I mean, you know, that,

841
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,940
that's the mentality of the
leadership of team. Yeah.

842
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,030
Yeah. Not Good. Then
as you just said here,

843
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:52,860
that made no sense, I thought, and you
were a corporal 20. How old were you?

844
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,400
I would say 2121 years old. And
you're looking at this going, hey man,

845
00:48:56,401 --> 00:48:58,740
this doesn't make any sense. We're the
ones that are sitting here briefing it.

846
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,370
Yeah. We know where the ones that know
how to call for fire. Yeah. I mean,

847
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:04,590
and I brought it, well, I
mean, first off, first off,

848
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,890
the Afghans can't even talk to anybody
that calls for fire or the helicopters.

849
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:10,410
I mean,
they don't even have any comms with them.

850
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,700
Their own h f you know what
I mean? Yeah, yeah. I mean,

851
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,130
I,
so the,

852
00:49:16,131 --> 00:49:21,131
the three main factors that I brought
up in the brief and I brought up that,

853
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:23,160
look, we're only, everybody's going in,

854
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:27,030
we have over 12 different moving elements
between the ops and different teams

855
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:30,270
inside this patrol. Yep.
All on one frequency.

856
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,710
I brought that up. I brought
up the fact that, um,

857
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,160
we didn't have direct air support is
on 15 minutes strip alert and that's in

858
00:49:38,161 --> 00:49:40,400
Jalalabad so all,
and you know,

859
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:44,160
so they were taking it as if the birds
would be there within 15 minutes. I said,

860
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,590
that's not what, 15 minutes
Tripler meetings. They're up.

861
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,300
That means off the ground in 15 minutes.

862
00:49:48,301 --> 00:49:52,650
And then they still got night are probably
60 minutes to get from Jalala bad to

863
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:55,260
us.
And so that was another factor.

864
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:58,040
And then the other thing
that I brought up was, um,

865
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,260
why would we put our snipers 2000 meters
away from the village outside of their

866
00:50:03,421 --> 00:50:06,210
effective range of their weapons? There
you go. But here's what I was told.

867
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,120
I'm an e four in the
United States Marine Corps.

868
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:10,440
What do I know about mission planning?

869
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:17,080
And that's why I was taken
out of the team check. So, um,

870
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:18,700
yeah,

871
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:20,860
when you say, when you talk about
getting taken out of the team,

872
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:24,670
explain how that went down a little bit.
So you've got your four man team. Yeah.

873
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,040
Team Monte. Yeah. It's your
money. And so what they did was,

874
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,610
is, you know, they had, there's like
they would put the teams, you know,

875
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:35,060
you would go with your Afghans
in here to do their part. Um,

876
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,290
so our team was supposed to
go to the back of the village,

877
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,270
cover the back side of it,

878
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,750
and then we were going to search couple
house up there for a machine gun. And, um,

879
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:49,340
while the meeting went on and they took
me out of the team because I brought up

880
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,330
those concerns and, um, you know,

881
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:57,110
they kind of took it as me going against
the orders, questioning their authority,

882
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,410
and they replaced me at the gunny,
gunny Johnson.

883
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:05,230
So I'm just, I just have to say this right
now, so I talk about this all the time.

884
00:51:05,231 --> 00:51:09,370
And, um, if you're in a leadership
position, you don't want, yes, ma'am.

885
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,240
You don't want, yes men. You want
the the corporal that says, Hey boss,

886
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:14,740
I don't understand why
you do that right now.

887
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,180
And if your answer to your
subordinate is because I said so,

888
00:51:19,181 --> 00:51:22,480
or it's you're already for be
quiet or you're an e five be quiet.

889
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:25,630
If that's what your answer is,
that means you don't have a real answer.

890
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:27,700
That means that what you're
doing is probably wrong.

891
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:31,330
So surround yourself,

892
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,580
the best people you can have on your
team or the people that are going to

893
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:36,040
question what what it is that your,
your plan is.

894
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,690
And if they question it and you can't,

895
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:40,930
don't have a good logical answer and your
plan doesn't stand on its own two feet.

896
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,360
Well think about it and reassess it and
take some advice from down the chain of

897
00:51:46,361 --> 00:51:48,910
command on how what we could
do to change this planet.

898
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,270
Yeah, I mean it was,
look, they're complacent.

899
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:55,573
You know,
that's,

900
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:59,120
that's the type of mentality that you
have when you don't expect to go get your

901
00:51:59,121 --> 00:51:59,954
ass handed to you.

902
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,770
That's why you need to expect to get your
ass handed to you every day and train

903
00:52:03,771 --> 00:52:04,604
like it.

904
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,480
Yeah. You know, I, I, I used
to, when I was running Turner,

905
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:11,490
we trained for worst case scenario all
the time. It was like worse than me.

906
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:16,320
You know what? And it was, it
was insane. Like we had great,

907
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:20,040
we had great financing for our training.
So the training was awesome.

908
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:23,190
We had mayhem going on,
we had paint balls and we had laser,

909
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:27,120
this multi multimillion dollar laser
tag system and we had roleplayers and it

910
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:29,190
was awesome.
And I wanted may him and we had,

911
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:32,610
we would put guys down and you'd
have to carry them out. And it was a,

912
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:35,800
it'd be like we'd be mayhem
and sometimes guys, cool,

913
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,220
this is coming to and realistic and
what are the chances this is really

914
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:42,120
happening? And I'd be like, look,
if this doesn't happen, great.

915
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,570
You don't ever have to worry about it
happen for real. But if it happens,

916
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,570
you'll be ready for it.
At least as ready as you can be.

917
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:49,823
Yeah.

918
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,600
So you get pulled off the team.

919
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,450
I got to pull it off the team and my
job was going to be to stay with the

920
00:52:57,451 --> 00:53:00,870
vehicle. So like basically we were going
to drive vehicles in park the vehicles.

921
00:53:00,871 --> 00:53:03,930
Now. That was the other thing I
said. I said, this is dumb. Why,

922
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,050
why would we leave our up armored
guns a couple of miles away?

923
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:15,000
And they said, you mean you ready for
the response here? You're ready. Oh,

924
00:53:15,001 --> 00:53:18,990
well Dakota, uh, because we want to
go into the village clendette Stein,

925
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,370
you have a 90 man patrol. Yeah.
Yeah. That's not going happen.

926
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,010
Just to paint

927
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:26,850
a picture for everyone.

928
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:31,890
Basically there's a deep ravine walls
on either side at the top of the ravine.

929
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,150
It kind of splits into two other ravines
and there's kind of villages on both

930
00:53:36,151 --> 00:53:36,984
sides of that.

931
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,970
Yeah. It splits into, it splits into two.

932
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:41,630
Like it's Kinda like two valleys
inside of a big valley. Right.

933
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:44,310
And on the right hand side
was another bad valley,

934
00:53:44,311 --> 00:53:48,210
but we were going in the left hand
side. Now is ganja call. And um,

935
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:53,550
I mean this, this terrain was built
to fight. It was built to fight.

936
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:54,870
I mean they had trenches in it,

937
00:53:55,650 --> 00:54:00,480
there were trenches in it that they
use to fight out of. It is not,

938
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,590
and obviously you're
walking up the valley,

939
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:05,570
which means automatically
you're in the low ground,

940
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:10,160
which is not where we want to be ever.
All right.

941
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:14,300
Now you the one of the guys you
are going to be working with.

942
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:16,123
MMM.

943
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:21,220
In the Hummers was staff
sergeant Juan Rodriguez Chavez.

944
00:54:21,531 --> 00:54:21,921
Here we go.

945
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:26,921
Back to the book I sought out Staff
Sergeant Juan Rodriguez Chavez are motor

946
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:30,260
transport chief.
I known him for five months.

947
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:33,860
He didn't stand on rank and we traded
stories about growing up on farms.

948
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:37,610
He had grown up on a ranch in Mexico
having a similar approach to life.

949
00:54:37,611 --> 00:54:39,200
Rob and I had become friends.

950
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:42,680
He was in the eighth grade when his
family moved to Texas where he learned

951
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:46,430
English, played football, earned
good grades and rope cows and Rodeos.

952
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:49,550
Our team called him hot rod.
He laughed a lot,

953
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:53,270
bragged about how smart his two daughters
were and kept all our vehicles in top

954
00:54:53,271 --> 00:54:57,560
condition. Rob, this mission is fucked
up if the shit hits the fan. I said,

955
00:54:57,590 --> 00:55:01,430
we're going in my teams walking
point and they'll get caught off.

956
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:04,640
We have to go in and get them out.

957
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:09,950
And he looked back at you devil dog.
Rod said,

958
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:12,560
say the word and I'll do the driving.

959
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,970
Yeah, that's legit. He's
the man. He is the man.

960
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:21,570
And uh,

961
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,820
continuing on, you say having
some sort of contingency plan.

962
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,630
Now I walked back to the adviser
headquarters and brief Lieutenant Johnson.

963
00:55:27,650 --> 00:55:29,980
By the way, Lieutenant Johnson didn't
want you out of the team either. Right?

964
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,990
He wanted you to stay with Canon.
Fake were pissed.

965
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:37,090
He knew that you should be with the team
if things get hairy.

966
00:55:37,091 --> 00:55:38,050
I said I'm coming in,

967
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:42,700
rod will drive radio your coordinates
and get down to the wash fucking climate

968
00:55:42,701 --> 00:55:45,610
and we'll haul ass back to the main body
cause they were going to be exposed on

969
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:46,510
the far end of that.
Right.

970
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,760
Wow. Yeah. So I,

971
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:52,200
so everything that I did was
planned out the night before check.

972
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:57,270
Everything that I did was planned out
the night before and it was all in our

973
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,940
team. I mean, I told him, I mean,
I told him, I said, you know,

974
00:55:59,941 --> 00:56:02,280
you say the word and I'll head in there.
I don't care.

975
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:06,780
I know I'm coming to get you. And um, I
mean that w we had this all planned out.

976
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:09,870
Like all they had to do was get
to the road and I would be there

977
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:15,650
continuing on back to
the book and the talk,

978
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:20,120
a report about Ganja Gall had
come in via brigade internet.

979
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:24,010
A special forces team reported that
32 fighters, we're moving Pakistan to

980
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:26,650
reinforce God. Your
Gall, half an hour later,

981
00:56:26,651 --> 00:56:30,520
the video feed from an unmanned aerial
vehicle showed a man with a mortar tube

982
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:34,420
on his back entering unknown, safehouse
two kilometers north of conjugal village.

983
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:37,750
10 minutes later for more men entered
the same house. So, so you're,

984
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:42,430
you're watching this. So here's
the crazy part. Nobody told us.

985
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:45,880
Oh, so you didn't even get
that report. Nobody told us.

986
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:51,610
Check. Um, and I got to
point out to everyone, I'm,

987
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,640
I'm obviously skipping giant chunks of
this book and there's an awesome amount

988
00:56:56,661 --> 00:57:00,870
of detail that,
that Dakota goes into in,

989
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,060
in how this is going down.

990
00:57:02,061 --> 00:57:05,960
And I'm kind of hitting the wave tops
to get to get the story there. But,

991
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,860
uh, okay. You don't even get that Intel,

992
00:57:09,861 --> 00:57:12,230
but doesn't matter because the next
day I guess where you're going into the

993
00:57:12,231 --> 00:57:17,090
valley, um, you got a guy
with you named Swenson,

994
00:57:17,091 --> 00:57:20,060
he's in charge of some border police,
some Afghan border police. Is that right?

995
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:20,894
Yeah.

996
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:26,170
So Swenson's border police turned
to Hafez when the lights went out.

997
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,560
Dutchman. He said, am I saying that
right? Dutchman Dishman Douche man,

998
00:57:30,561 --> 00:57:34,170
which is another term for
enemy for enemy douche man.

999
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,360
They said we must turn back. So they're
already freaking out. Yeah. Yeah. So they,

1000
00:57:38,361 --> 00:57:41,600
I think I, uh, I think
that they, they were, uh,

1001
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:45,130
why some of the police had already
knew they had lead tipped it off. Yep.

1002
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:48,940
They had had information one way or the
other when we were coming in and they

1003
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,310
leaked the plan. Yeah. So I think that
that's why they were trying to bail out,

1004
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,140
in my opinion, it was because they knew
what was already there. Yeah. Got It.

1005
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:00,680
And um,
just before five in the morning,

1006
00:58:00,681 --> 00:58:02,860
rod and I heard gravel contract
crunching on the trust.

1007
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:07,040
So now you're actually in position, you
dropped off the guys and now, uh, the,

1008
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:11,390
the Afghan team with some of the advisors
including team Monte are heading up

1009
00:58:11,391 --> 00:58:14,300
the valley and you're waiting
at the bottom end of the valley.

1010
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,970
I'm sitting back at the back of the
trucks and they're going, you know,

1011
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:19,580
they're going into the valley and um,
yeah,

1012
00:58:19,581 --> 00:58:22,760
at this point now everybody's leaving
the valley. Yeah. This, this part,

1013
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:27,260
just before five in the morning, rod and
I heard gravel crunching on the trail.

1014
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,090
Men, women, children,

1015
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,780
sheep and goats suddenly hurried by
our trucks heading out of the valley.

1016
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:34,160
Okay.

1017
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:37,880
Predawn always brought the first sing
song called a prayer followed by per

1018
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:42,880
people scurrying about. And, and this
is just, you knew right then, right? Oh,

1019
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,360
a hundred percent no, 110%
yeah. I mean, no doubt. So this,

1020
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,270
do you know, just for anyone
that's listening that is important?

1021
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,410
Two and two together here,

1022
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,440
there's a village with a
bunch of civilians in it
and the civilians all leave

1023
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:57,880
and they take their animals with them.
They take all their,

1024
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,280
they take everything that's worth,

1025
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:03,140
worth anything with him so they
know that there's, it's on.

1026
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,830
Going back to the book as Lieutenant
Johnson Approach, the first row of houses,

1027
00:59:09,831 --> 00:59:12,620
he radioed back to Garza
that he and lieutenant ruler,

1028
00:59:12,621 --> 00:59:17,210
we're heading toward the house of
an e mom, one of the village elders.

1029
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,190
Seconds later, an RPG street in from
the east followed by a of PKM, a Russian

1030
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,520
made machine gun that shoots a
hefty 7.62 millimeter cartridge.

1031
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,900
It started tearing up the ground and the
Adobe walls as the men took cover among

1032
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:33,010
the terrorist walls.
More PKM fire came in from the northeast,

1033
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:35,450
joined by a k's at a closer range.

1034
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,960
Enemy fighters were crouched inside
the houses and below the windows of the

1035
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,850
schoolhouse on the southern Ridge.

1036
00:59:40,851 --> 00:59:44,390
They were hiding in the alleyways and dug
in behind the stone terrorist walls to

1037
00:59:44,391 --> 00:59:45,170
the east.

1038
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:50,170
They had a dozen fixed positions and we're
shooting downhill with the sun behind

1039
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:55,510
them. Yeah. They know what
they're doing. Yeah. This is, um,

1040
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,050
again,
um,

1041
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,340
do any kind of anybody with any kind
of military knowledge whatsoever.

1042
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:06,280
When you read that paragraph or that,
that does two paragraphs right there,

1043
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:09,730
you see that you are not in a horrible,
horrible scenario.

1044
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:14,770
Multiple enemy machine
gun positions in elevated

1045
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:20,270
coordinated attack. Yeah. Horrible.

1046
01:00:22,810 --> 01:00:26,140
And here's your thoughts back to the book.
I waited for the firing to die down,

1047
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:27,640
but it didn't.

1048
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,050
The chaos of the RPG explosions,

1049
01:00:31,051 --> 01:00:34,170
PKM machine guns [inaudible]
and [inaudible] increased.

1050
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,240
I heard the report of a recoil less rifle,

1051
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:40,110
basically a hundred pounds shoulder or
tripod mounted cannon and a sure sign of

1052
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:41,850
a plan.
Damn Bush as a Douche.

1053
01:00:41,851 --> 01:00:45,180
Men Don't lug that over
the hills for an exercise.

1054
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:48,300
Then I heard the crump crump
of their mortar shells.

1055
01:00:48,570 --> 01:00:52,860
There was a wide babble of voices on the
command radio advisers yelling at each

1056
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:56,370
other to clear the net. No one was taking
charge. There was no central command.

1057
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:58,020
I was pacing around,
frustrated,

1058
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,080
being out of the fight and
not being able to help.

1059
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,350
So yeah,

1060
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,120
seen enough of like little firefights
that we'd be able to burst of fire and

1061
01:01:08,121 --> 01:01:10,270
then people are going to run it by me
know, like they're going to just see,

1062
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,890
they blow their load like right in
the beginning and then you know,

1063
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:16,070
they don't have enough.
Like they're not able to like us resupply,

1064
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:18,100
they don't sustain anything.

1065
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,500
This was endless.
And then yeah,

1066
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:25,300
you mentioned this earlier and again
just to kind of point out to people,

1067
01:01:25,301 --> 01:01:28,660
so they, so they understand what you
were talking about. You said Hey,

1068
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:32,440
there's going to be 14 different
maneuver elements. A 12 yeah.

1069
01:01:32,441 --> 01:01:35,510
12 different maneuver elements
and they're all on the same net.

1070
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:39,040
Now what that means is they're
all in the same radio frequency.

1071
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:40,930
So picture this you,

1072
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,800
you're trying to have a conversation
on the phone but so or 12 other people,

1073
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,980
11 other people all trying
to have a conversation on
the phone at the same time.

1074
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:50,050
Yeah. With their, with their nerves,

1075
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,960
with their nerves while
they're chaos is happening.

1076
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:54,810
Yeah.
And

1077
01:01:55,570 --> 01:02:00,480
so this is what you end up
doing is actually on a phone
you have a better chance

1078
01:02:00,481 --> 01:02:03,840
because a phone, we'll kind of kind
of let some of that traffic through,

1079
01:02:03,841 --> 01:02:06,210
but when you start stepping
on each other on the radio,

1080
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:08,700
it just cut each other off
and you can't hear anything.

1081
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:10,850
That's exactly what happened.

1082
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:15,890
And the other piece of it was it's not
just that it was all that one frequency,

1083
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:18,990
everything had to be relayed
through those snipers to get there.

1084
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,140
The elevated high ground

1085
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,750
to get back to the,
could you,

1086
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,560
did you have direct coms with the
guys on the ground? Yes I did.

1087
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,990
But I'm saying like to get to the
command like you know in the big thing I

1088
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:30,900
brought up was was you know what happens
if you're calling it a med evac and

1089
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:35,430
you're calling in call
for fire. Yeah, that's,

1090
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,660
that's like trying to call the fire
department and the ambulance and,

1091
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,980
and you're trying to call
him at the same time.

1092
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:43,590
Like you gotta you gotta separate them?
Yes. Actually that's not a good example.

1093
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:46,290
It's trying to call the
ambulance and it active shooter.

1094
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,720
And trying to maneuver all that
stuff happening at the same time.

1095
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,643
Yeah.

1096
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,220
Back to the book soon.

1097
01:02:53,221 --> 01:02:58,170
Both Ridge lines were sparkling with fire
as the ass cars and Douche Min engaged

1098
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:02,160
each other with rocket propelled grenades.
Smoking shrapnel filled the air.

1099
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,020
MMM Swenson

1100
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,490
ease.
He's on.

1101
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,540
This is Highlander six he yelled over
the Din Ford Ford Line of troops pinned

1102
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:17,010
down at x Ray Delta and
heavy enemy fire request.

1103
01:03:17,011 --> 01:03:20,850
Immediate cert suppression
fire Kilo Echo will adjust.

1104
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,880
So he's trying to call fire
your back and you and rod says,

1105
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,330
what do you think rod said if the
Dishman caught around the rear,

1106
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:34,350
I said and close the back door.
They'll catch our people in a fire sac.

1107
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:36,690
This is deep shit.
They got to get out of there.

1108
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:40,230
The way to break up an ambush
is to hammer it with heavy fire.

1109
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:43,560
The Humvee gave us armor
mobility and a heavy gun.

1110
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,000
We would roll in and bring team Monte
back to the location of the command group.

1111
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:52,500
I grabbed the radio and called Fox
Fox three Lieutenant Fabio, no reply.

1112
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:57,120
I tried Fox six Williams and then
Fox nine first Sergeant Garza.

1113
01:03:57,450 --> 01:03:58,380
No one replied.

1114
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:02,130
I was calling for permission to enter
the valley asking for it from anyone who

1115
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:03,420
would answer.
Finally,

1116
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:07,500
Fox seven Valdez up on the
northern Ridge answered on the net.

1117
01:04:07,650 --> 01:04:11,340
Fox three three your request
to enter the valley are denied.

1118
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,030
Fox Nine says you are to stay
at your present location.

1119
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,340
Okay,

1120
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,170
and again, I'm throwing out a
bunch of different names here.

1121
01:04:20,171 --> 01:04:22,840
These are all the different leaders
that are out there on these different 12

1122
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:26,130
elements and when you read the book for
yourself, you can kind of catch and,

1123
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:30,700
and understand exactly what was
happening there. But the, the,

1124
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:35,440
the, basically what was going on was your
calling to whoever would answer to get

1125
01:04:35,441 --> 01:04:38,130
permission to drive up the
valley and go give a hand. Yeah.

1126
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,040
Shine and get permission.

1127
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,130
I put down the hand set and sat there
listening as the does as a dozen advisors

1128
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:49,750
try to talk over a single radio channel.
It was sheer bedlam. This is bullshit.

1129
01:04:49,751 --> 01:04:53,980
Rod. I recheck the ammo belt and the
Mark 19 rod sat in the driver's seat.

1130
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:57,430
You Ready, rod? Give it a few more
minutes. Meyer, you'll fry for this.

1131
01:04:57,431 --> 01:05:01,390
He said he was right, I'd get sent
home for disobeying a direct order.

1132
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:03,280
There was no question
in my mind about that.

1133
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:06,670
I was already on thin ice with Garza,
Fabio and Williams.

1134
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,220
So I sat there frustrated
listening to the shooting,

1135
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:12,730
flexing my hands on the grips of
the mark 19 and breathing hard.

1136
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:14,020
I tried to calm down,

1137
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:19,350
maybe the battle sounded worse on the
radio than it really son of a bitch inside

1138
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:21,990
the tactical operations center at joy.

1139
01:05:21,991 --> 01:05:26,680
So Joyce is a couple miles away and the
TAC or operation center is where they're

1140
01:05:26,681 --> 01:05:29,350
running this. There were
supposed to have, um,

1141
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,160
kind of situational awareness of
everything that's happening and they're

1142
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:35,680
supposed to be able to supply supply,
fire support.

1143
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:38,210
So that's why when we're talking about
the tactical operations center at Joyce,

1144
01:05:38,211 --> 01:05:39,040
that's what it is.

1145
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:42,880
Captain Aaron Harding was the senior
officer on duty from midnight to eight in

1146
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:44,380
the morning.
The battle captain.

1147
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,980
He had been in Afghanistan for eight
months but had rarely controlled fires and

1148
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:52,981
certainly not in certainly not unlike
this as artillery stood by at Joyce a few

1149
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,210
miles away.
Ended up [inaudible] a few miles away.

1150
01:05:58,211 --> 01:06:03,211
Harding asked for more and
more information from the
men on the long table who

1151
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:04,990
was requesting the fire missions?

1152
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:09,970
Was it shadow for Highlander five or Fox
three what did they heard from Fox six

1153
01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,750
who is presently in charge?
The marine advisors or the Afghan army.

1154
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,150
Did the ground commander know
where all his troops were?

1155
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,700
Had they double check
the grids of the k ease.

1156
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:20,210
Okay.

1157
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:22,190
He asked question after question.

1158
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:23,460
Okay.

1159
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:24,010
At Joyce,

1160
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:29,010
120 millimeter millimeter mortars were
fired for fired 15 minutes after Fabio

1161
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:32,550
requested. The first shell though struck
within 50 meters of the enemy position.

1162
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,340
The next flurry of shells was on target.

1163
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:40,970
That would be the only effective fire
mission of the entire day and this is one

1164
01:06:42,991 --> 01:06:44,370
of the things that you're
going to get more into.

1165
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,510
We actually recently talked about the,
the battle in the,

1166
01:06:48,511 --> 01:06:53,511
I drank valley and those guys would
absolutely 100% have been overrun.

1167
01:06:53,581 --> 01:06:57,090
And what saved their ass over and over
again was artillery and fire support.

1168
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:01,860
Yeah. That's the biggest advantage that
we have on the battlefield as Americans.

1169
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,760
100% and your co and your
team is calling for it.

1170
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,290
The advisors are calling for
it and they're not getting it.

1171
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,600
Yeah. We're not getting it. I mean,
they shut it down and, and, and, and to,

1172
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:16,240
to try to give the benefit of the doubt
here. Right. A of why they shut it down.

1173
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:20,590
I totally understand it, but it goes back
to the one thing I said, right? I mean,

1174
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:23,110
they couldn't probably couldn't figure
out who the hell was calling what and

1175
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:24,310
where, what was where. I mean,

1176
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:27,590
I don't know that I could've
confidently fired around and,

1177
01:07:28,030 --> 01:07:32,770
but part of it was because of the
layout of everybody on one frequency,

1178
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,160
you know, it goes back to
the initial problem. Like,

1179
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:38,590
I don't know if I could have
fire round now I am. I am.

1180
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:41,200
I pissed that they didn't fire
around. Absolutely. Like it was wrong.

1181
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:45,780
It was wrong for what the reasons
they did it. But you know, I, I,

1182
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:50,800
the confusion was so chaotic
in the beginning especially.

1183
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,100
Um, but I can tell you this,
that if they had got the rounds,

1184
01:07:55,950 --> 01:08:00,630
it broke the enemy
and you don't again to,

1185
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:03,840
to advance your point of giving
the benefit of the doubt.

1186
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:06,300
If they have no idea where friendlies are,

1187
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:10,080
they could've fired rounds
on friendly forces as well.
Exactly. And then, you know,

1188
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:13,320
they'd have been accountable for
that. And I'll tell you, that's, um,

1189
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:18,390
that's a hard to make to,
to possibly, you know,

1190
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:21,470
fratricide blue on blue is,
is in my opinion,

1191
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,420
that's the worst thing
that happened in war.

1192
01:08:24,230 --> 01:08:28,880
And so what these guys are being
asked to possibly do is, is,

1193
01:08:28,970 --> 01:08:30,780
is risk a fratricide yes.

1194
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:36,070
Which in their minds and most
probably a lot of military minds,

1195
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,480
I think mine included. Well, it's
hard to say what's better, you know,

1196
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:45,230
risk fratricide or risk,
uh, getting overrun.

1197
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,680
Now if we know for a fact people are
getting overrun, then you're like, okay,

1198
01:08:48,681 --> 01:08:51,720
we'll risk fratricide. And that's why
that happens sometimes where people say,

1199
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,070
dropped that bomb no matter what,
but to say,

1200
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,440
I'm not 100% sure people
are going to over run,

1201
01:08:57,441 --> 01:09:00,290
but I'm still going to take the
risk of fratricide at this point.

1202
01:09:00,291 --> 01:09:03,800
That's probably why they're holding
off it is in the beginning. Yeah. Yeah,

1203
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,040
and they get to a point where they call
the danger close rounds and try and take

1204
01:09:07,041 --> 01:09:11,090
responsibility and we'll, we'll
get there. Back to the book.

1205
01:09:11,091 --> 01:09:15,240
The enemy above the neb above work
their way around the edges of the valley

1206
01:09:15,241 --> 01:09:16,120
shooting downhill.

1207
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:20,270
The Taliban machine gunners tracting on
one ass car then another than another.

1208
01:09:20,271 --> 01:09:23,420
It was a killing ground.
They're all over the place.

1209
01:09:23,421 --> 01:09:26,090
Swenson was thinking to himself,
I may not make it out of here.

1210
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,060
Okay.

1211
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,540
If you hunker down and don't shoot back,
you will surely die.

1212
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:36,220
The other side gains confidence and
rushes forward in the frenzy of combat

1213
01:09:36,221 --> 01:09:37,810
soldiers act like sharks.

1214
01:09:37,990 --> 01:09:42,520
They sense weakness and circle in picking
off the wounded and the defenseless.

1215
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:47,500
Slowly the Douche men we're closing
in from both sides of the wash,

1216
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,300
so they were ready.

1217
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:53,570
Oh the, let me tell you something.
They were good. They were good.

1218
01:09:53,571 --> 01:09:58,280
They were trained that year. You know,
they had, they had plate carriers.

1219
01:09:58,530 --> 01:10:02,570
They are taking the uniforms off
or a dead guys. Um, you know,

1220
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:05,690
they put Kev Lars on shit.
They're good.

1221
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,680
Still trying to get fire support here.
Swenson.

1222
01:10:10,681 --> 01:10:13,290
It identified enemy position
to four grid positions.

1223
01:10:13,291 --> 01:10:15,180
There are two basic ways
of calling in artillery.

1224
01:10:15,181 --> 01:10:20,181
You can give the grid coordinates of
the target or the Kilo Echo number for a

1225
01:10:20,821 --> 01:10:24,900
grid and adjust after the initial round
or you can give your own location and a

1226
01:10:24,901 --> 01:10:27,210
compass bearing to and
distance to the target.

1227
01:10:27,211 --> 01:10:29,520
The second technique is
called a polar mission.

1228
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:32,880
Provides the guns with the locations
of both the friendly observer and the

1229
01:10:32,881 --> 01:10:37,710
target. Tell the talk. I'll send
it. Polar Swenson. Radio de Kaplan.

1230
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:42,000
It's on me. Give them my initials.
I'm making the decision, not them.

1231
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,410
Assuming accurate fire. The U s
mortars were less than two miles away.

1232
01:10:46,411 --> 01:10:50,340
The only target endangered by the
polar plot was the enemy by sending his

1233
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:54,030
initial Swenson was taking full
responsibility. If anything went wrong.

1234
01:10:54,031 --> 01:10:55,890
If a friendly soldier
or civilian were hit,

1235
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:00,090
the burden rested squarely on sweats
and not with the talk in the rear.

1236
01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:04,770
The talk responded to the polar request
by asking again for information that was

1237
01:11:04,771 --> 01:11:07,740
impossible to provide.
Where were all the friendly troops?

1238
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:10,290
What was the forward line of
trace of the friendly units?

1239
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,810
Was everyone accounted for?
Were any civilians?

1240
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:15,940
Yeah.

1241
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:20,440
Kaplan told shadow the relay team above
the him tell the talk. That's that.

1242
01:11:20,441 --> 01:11:25,420
It's critical. I repeat critical.
We have advisers pin down the talk.

1243
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:26,860
Denied shadows,
fire mission,

1244
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,760
Furious Sergeant Summers at shadow
for pressed back against the talk.

1245
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,270
The main element is being hit
from the north, east and south.

1246
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:38,050
All elements are engaged. I repeat.
All elements are heavily engaged.

1247
01:11:38,051 --> 01:11:39,550
We need fire missions.
Now.

1248
01:11:41,740 --> 01:11:43,090
The NCO is inside the talk.

1249
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:47,470
We're doing their job and the artillery
and mortar cruise wanted to oblige.

1250
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:51,010
Yet it seemed to sergeant summers that
every time he relayed a fire mission to

1251
01:11:51,011 --> 01:11:52,840
talk,
ask him 20 questions.

1252
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:56,680
A second string was running
the show here and not well.

1253
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,130
Okay.

1254
01:11:58,130 --> 01:11:58,963
In firefights.

1255
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:03,920
It's not unusual for 200 to 2000 artillery
shells to be fired over the course of

1256
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:08,510
the first hour of the ballot.
Ganja gall when men lay trapped and dying.

1257
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:12,350
The talk at Joyce allowed only
21 artillery shells to be fired.

1258
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,203
Yeah.

1259
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:21,000
Since World War II forward observers
had received artillery fire.

1260
01:12:21,001 --> 01:12:26,001
Under the rule of silence is consent
when it observer called for fire.

1261
01:12:26,911 --> 01:12:30,660
The mission went by radio to the
operation center and to the guns.

1262
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:34,590
Silence by the ops center constituted
consent for the guns to fire

1263
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:40,430
and the 21st century with computers
making instant firing calculations within

1264
01:12:40,431 --> 01:12:42,530
two minutes shells could
be hitting the target,

1265
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,900
but beginning about 2006 sergeants
and lieutenants on the front lines,

1266
01:12:47,901 --> 01:12:48,980
we're trusted less.

1267
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:52,880
The high command believed the grunts
were too quick to call and fires that

1268
01:12:52,881 --> 01:12:56,690
endangered civilians resulting in an
embittered population that supported the

1269
01:12:56,691 --> 01:13:00,920
insurgency. The solution was
to apply a strict new rule.

1270
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:05,750
Two months before gone. De Gaulle,
general Stanley McChrystal,

1271
01:13:05,751 --> 01:13:09,560
the senior commander in Afghanistan
issued a directive that forbade the use of

1272
01:13:09,561 --> 01:13:14,561
artillery against or near any structure
likely to contain civilians unless the

1273
01:13:14,991 --> 01:13:15,620
higher,

1274
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:20,620
the next higher headquarters commander
had approved that ended silence is

1275
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:22,664
consent.

1276
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:28,330
The high command had shifted decision
making from the battlefield to the staff.

1277
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:32,810
Swenson was not trusted to
make the hard decisions.

1278
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:38,090
Instead officer's in the talk with a
confused idea of the battlefield had to

1279
01:13:38,091 --> 01:13:41,570
decide whether to honor
his requests for fire.

1280
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:46,300
Yeah, I know it. So that's where my
problem comes in, right. Is, you know,

1281
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,840
if the doctrine is that you, I give my
initials, I take the responsibility,

1282
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,070
we'll then follow the doctrine.
Yeah. You know, that's, there's,

1283
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:55,820
there's where they went

1284
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:59,040
wrong. And I'll, I'll tell you
something else that, you know,

1285
01:13:59,041 --> 01:14:02,970
you talked about how confusing it was
over the net and clearly it was obviously

1286
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:03,804
very confusing.

1287
01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:09,530
How long would it take to verbally
explain the layout of this whole,

1288
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:12,773
Oh,

1289
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,020
it would take a very long time.

1290
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:18,250
It would take an extremely eloquent
person who had the time to kind of compose

1291
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:20,410
himself and,
and sit there and try and explain it.

1292
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,440
That's why you make Kate Key low echoes.

1293
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:26,560
That's why you have these preplanned
fire positions so that you don't have to

1294
01:14:26,561 --> 01:14:28,900
think anymore.
We can direct fires and,

1295
01:14:28,940 --> 01:14:32,260
and what instead of having to communicate
what the situation on the ground is,

1296
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:35,620
what you communicate is this is what we
need and this is where you need to put

1297
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:39,580
it. I mean, that's 100% in
it. I mean, that's 100%.

1298
01:14:39,581 --> 01:14:43,970
It is, you know, um, you
could never first off you,

1299
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:48,040
you could never relay all the
information there and guess what,

1300
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:51,530
at the end of the day, it was irrelevant
to what they were needing to do it.

1301
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:54,550
And also by the time you, if you could
relay it by the time you related,

1302
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:56,950
it would be different because what are
you going to tell everyone to sit still

1303
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:59,770
for a minute while I explain where you
are, that doesn't work. That's why,

1304
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,670
that's why decentralized command
is so important on the battlefield.

1305
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,820
This is the exact reason why decentralized
command is so important on the

1306
01:15:06,821 --> 01:15:07,630
battlefield.

1307
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:11,290
When you centralized command people and
the people that actually are there that

1308
01:15:11,291 --> 01:15:13,910
need to be able to make decisions,
make things happen, can't do it. Yup.

1309
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:15,610
Okay.

1310
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,660
Um, and by the way, how do you
overcome a situation like this?

1311
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:24,220
How do you overcome a situation
where, okay, you're my subordinate,

1312
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:27,430
you work for me and I don't,

1313
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,730
I don't want you to be able to have
the ability to fire because I'm afraid

1314
01:15:30,731 --> 01:15:32,350
you're gonna hurt civilians.
How do I solve that?

1315
01:15:32,590 --> 01:15:34,650
The way to solve it is not to say no,
I don't get that.

1316
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:38,350
You got Authority the way I solve
it, as they say, okay, Dakota,

1317
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:42,010
let me explain some things to you.
We need to protect the civilian populace.

1318
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,710
We need to make sure we don't damage
any infrastructure to the best of our

1319
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,830
ability. I want you to understand
how strategically important that is.

1320
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:50,170
Do you understand?
Let me put you through some scenarios.

1321
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,880
What if you were here in this happened?
What would you do?

1322
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:53,200
What if you're hearing this happened?
What would you do?

1323
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:58,360
I train you and I build trust so
that I can decentralize the command.

1324
01:15:58,450 --> 01:16:00,970
That's how you overcome it.
You don't overcome it.

1325
01:16:01,030 --> 01:16:05,620
It's a shortcut to try and centralize and
it ends up getting people killed. 100%

1326
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:11,370
all right.

1327
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:14,901
Going back to the book,

1328
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:17,870
Fox three one Lieutenant Johnson
finally came up on the radio,

1329
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:23,240
were pinned down in a house receiving
accurate fire from the next house.

1330
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:24,410
We have to get out of here.

1331
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:28,850
He was caught off by others
pushing to use the same frequency.

1332
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:31,820
Three or four advisors. We're trying
to talk, stepping on each other.

1333
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,730
I could hear the strain in their voices.
The lack of Chris borders,

1334
01:16:34,731 --> 01:16:38,960
the frantic yelling of men who were
pinned down after a few minutes,

1335
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,630
Fox three to staff sergeant can affect,

1336
01:16:41,631 --> 01:16:46,220
tried to pass his location on the
grid to Fabio. I can't shoot back.

1337
01:16:46,221 --> 01:16:49,070
Aaron said, because I'm pinned down
there shooting at me from the house.

1338
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:53,370
It's so close. Grid three two.

1339
01:16:53,371 --> 01:16:56,790
This is three three radio staff
sergeant can affect, repeat your grid,

1340
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,930
repeat your grid or you. You radioed
to Kenefick. Repeat your grid.

1341
01:17:00,931 --> 01:17:01,770
Repeat your grid.

1342
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:07,190
So he faded as he was trying to tell you
is grid nothing after that but static

1343
01:17:07,231 --> 01:17:10,100
in garbled voices that broke it for

1344
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:15,050
me. I had promised my team I would
be there as far as I was concerned.

1345
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:18,110
My command element wasn't in command

1346
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:31,100
twice. I had heard shadow say that
air would be on station in 15 minutes.

1347
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:32,060
Nothing happened.

1348
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:35,480
How long do you do nothing while your
friends are fighting for their lives?

1349
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,320
Fox seven this is three. Three sitting
here is stupid. We're going in.

1350
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:43,490
Rod and I were on the net with Valdez.
There was no dispute among us.

1351
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,860
It was about zero 600 time to move.

1352
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:50,420
I was the vehicle commander so the
fault lay with me for disobeying orders.

1353
01:17:50,421 --> 01:17:53,480
If I arrived in the valley and discovered
that the command group had had the

1354
01:17:53,481 --> 01:17:54,770
situation under control,

1355
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:58,490
I knew there was a good chance I'd be
sent back to the states and disgrace.

1356
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,310
When I shouted the ask ours to follow us.

1357
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:04,040
They look confused up
on the north outpost.

1358
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:06,230
Valdez grabbed a senior Afghan sergeant,

1359
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,470
the sergeant radio to the Afghan
drivers clustered around our truck,

1360
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,840
urging them and past due to follow me,

1361
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,680
mortar shells were falling a
football field away to our west.

1362
01:18:15,890 --> 01:18:17,870
The enemy knew our trucks
were somewhere on the path,

1363
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:21,920
but uncertain just where the explosions
made my made the askers jumpy,

1364
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:22,821
just the same.

1365
01:18:22,821 --> 01:18:26,600
Some of them jumped into two Humvees
and roared in a position behind us. Rod,

1366
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:30,770
let's go.
I said he put it in gear.

1367
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:35,301
Now.

1368
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:40,280
By that time you start actually going
into the valley and as you're going in,

1369
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:44,240
by that time several NASCAR's,
we're stumbling out of the battlefield.

1370
01:18:44,241 --> 01:18:48,690
Some bleeding, a few without the rifles,
all exhausted where Americani I yell,

1371
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:52,960
dose dose, the ass cars pointed
up toward the village. So,

1372
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:55,790
so as you're driving in your scene,
guys fleeing the battlefield,

1373
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:00,380
I mean it was like, it was
terrible. Like is we go in and you,

1374
01:19:00,381 --> 01:19:03,920
you're just seeing these guys come out
and it's in Ramadan so they won't eat or

1375
01:19:03,921 --> 01:19:06,260
they won't drink any water and they're
coming out of this battle and they're

1376
01:19:06,261 --> 01:19:09,560
just like,
you're not even close to the valley yet,

1377
01:19:09,561 --> 01:19:11,930
and they're coming out as battle.
They don't have any weapons on them.

1378
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:16,550
They're just broken. Their
bloodied there, there been shot.

1379
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:20,450
They've just, I mean, you're carrying
each other and you're just like,

1380
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:22,190
okay,

1381
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,210
what are we going into?

1382
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,090
Somewhere behind us
was a u s army platoon.

1383
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:33,050
It seemed to me to be a time
for them to make a move.

1384
01:19:33,051 --> 01:19:34,640
They were the quick reaction force.

1385
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,560
Our Insurance Policy Valdez was on the
radio argument with dog three six the

1386
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:40,401
quick reaction.

1387
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:45,401
Army platoon commander dog-free six this
is Fox seven Valdez radio radioed you

1388
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:46,730
need to get in there man.
Fox,

1389
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:50,360
three threes to your front in a Humvee
drive east until you link up with him.

1390
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:52,850
Fox seven this is dark
three six at the lieutenant.

1391
01:19:52,851 --> 01:19:54,590
Our vehicles are too big for the mission.

1392
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,000
Okay.

1393
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,650
We were driving on a footpath.
I was barely wide enough for our home.

1394
01:19:58,651 --> 01:20:02,480
The Valdez came up with an alternative
dog-free six. This is Fox seven.

1395
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,780
I understand. Drive forward until
you reach the Afghan vehicles.

1396
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:08,550
Use them to get into the fight.
There are people out there dying.

1397
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:12,870
The platoon leader said he had to wait
for clearance from the talk at Joyce.

1398
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,483
Yeah.

1399
01:20:16,210 --> 01:20:19,630
What kind of vehicles did the
QRF after an MRI. APPS. Okay.

1400
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:21,873
No

1401
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,220
God, I mean me excuse. Yeah. How
awesome would it be to have an m wrap?

1402
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:32,460
Roland did this situation with and I
don't think they could have the road.

1403
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:35,250
Wouldn't tell it to small. Yeah. Cause
they ended up coming in and one of those,

1404
01:20:35,251 --> 01:20:35,850
uh,

1405
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:40,850
it looks like a tank but it's on wheels
and it ended up flipping over often off

1406
01:20:40,861 --> 01:20:44,920
the bank. But they look at the end of
the day, we had a ton of Humvees, women,

1407
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:48,000
we just brought in 90
people sitting right there.

1408
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:49,950
They could have jumped
in the Humvees and came.

1409
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:54,630
Yeah.

1410
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:59,460
The helicopter ops center called back
saying the re tasking of the birds had

1411
01:20:59,461 --> 01:21:04,461
been canceled because lance had not
called his own brigade headquarters to ask

1412
01:21:04,981 --> 01:21:05,521
permission.

1413
01:21:05,521 --> 01:21:09,030
And because another mission north of
Ganja Gall was of higher priority.

1414
01:21:09,031 --> 01:21:12,720
So one of the guys in the, in the ops
center had actually said, you know what?

1415
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:15,540
Screw it, I'm calling for
calling for kilos. And he,

1416
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:18,480
but he hadn't called the brigade and run
through the proper chain of command and

1417
01:21:18,481 --> 01:21:19,680
they,
they shut him down.

1418
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:21,323
Yeah.

1419
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:28,500
So here we go. More than an hour into
the fight, the situation was as follows,

1420
01:21:28,501 --> 01:21:32,850
team Monte was trapped in a house in the
u s and Afghan commanders were pinned

1421
01:21:32,851 --> 01:21:35,760
down by shooters closing in
on them from three sides.

1422
01:21:37,070 --> 01:21:37,350
Yeah.

1423
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:40,500
The North and south observation
posts were under fire.

1424
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:43,440
The ass cars were caught in
the open with nowhere to hide.

1425
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,800
Rod and I hadn't reached
the wash. The one, three,

1426
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,470
two quick reaction platoon
was not quick reacting.

1427
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,720
The talk at Joyce was paralyzed,

1428
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:56,750
preventing artillery support and the
helicopter gunships had not arrived.

1429
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:03,550
It was a perfect storm.

1430
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:07,633
Damn.

1431
01:22:10,310 --> 01:22:15,010
That's just, um, there's
absolutely nothing else.

1432
01:22:15,011 --> 01:22:19,270
Go wrong right now. It's a perfect
storm is the absolute perfect storm.

1433
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:24,540
Okay?

1434
01:22:24,540 --> 01:22:29,540
Swenson wanted a massive artillery
barrage because the Douche man didn't have

1435
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:33,260
overhead cover. Artillery. Air
Bursts would send millions of lance.

1436
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:34,800
It's raining down toward them.

1437
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:38,850
Hundreds of shells had to shake the
mountains and roll funder down the valley.

1438
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,310
The douche, man, we're zealots,
but they weren't crazy.

1439
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:43,860
Once artillery began exploding overhead,

1440
01:22:43,861 --> 01:22:46,890
gunman with eight K's wouldn't get
up and run forward in the open.

1441
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,470
Yet the talk refused to fire it gone.

1442
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:56,330
Juggalo me a few miles from Camp Joyce
on leasing a barrage in your own backyard

1443
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:58,560
wouldn't win any applause
at higher headquarters.

1444
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,260
The directive from the
high command was so clear.

1445
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:05,980
Do not employ air to ground or
indirect fires against compounds

1446
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,940
to as any structure or building
known or likely to contain civilians.

1447
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:15,190
Unless the ground force commander has
verified that no civilians are present.

1448
01:23:23,810 --> 01:23:27,690
Sarah and I mean, you
know, and there's that.

1449
01:23:27,691 --> 01:23:30,510
You know that rule right there
is Britain so impossible.

1450
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:34,810
You know what do you do? [inaudible]
mean the village you're getting shot at.

1451
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:37,470
So you run through there, you
civilian. Are you shooting me?

1452
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:40,180
Okay.

1453
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,013
You know,
um,

1454
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:46,960
I'd have to look do like a full
review of the Rois or this Pacific der

1455
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:50,380
Directive. But you know, normally the
self defense thing trumps everything.

1456
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:53,680
Well, usually, and that's what I always
say, right. I always talk about Roe is,

1457
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,070
and you know, Ryes we'll say, you know,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Within,

1458
01:23:57,110 --> 01:23:59,480
at the end of it, it always ends, it says,

1459
01:23:59,510 --> 01:24:03,520
or hostile act, hostile
intent. [inaudible]

1460
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:08,870
but it's all by interpretation. I mean,
it goes back to the commanders. I mean,

1461
01:24:10,760 --> 01:24:11,540
you know,

1462
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:16,540
I don't blame the Rov that Stanley
McChrystal put in place for what happened

1463
01:24:16,581 --> 01:24:19,100
that day.
I blame the people,

1464
01:24:19,101 --> 01:24:23,000
the leadership who was
incompetent to make a decision.

1465
01:24:25,010 --> 01:24:26,810
You know what I mean? Like, like,

1466
01:24:26,990 --> 01:24:31,370
it's like nobody wants to just own
it and take accountability and take

1467
01:24:31,371 --> 01:24:32,750
responsibility and say,
you know what,

1468
01:24:33,020 --> 01:24:36,380
I'm doing this because it's the right
thing to do. They want to be able to say,

1469
01:24:36,381 --> 01:24:40,850
well, I didn't do it because, well,
this is the order. Come on, come on.

1470
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:45,260
You know, if you're in a
leadership position to take,

1471
01:24:45,680 --> 01:24:46,540
take responsibility.

1472
01:24:46,590 --> 01:24:48,200
Yeah.
Um,

1473
01:24:50,170 --> 01:24:50,910
yeah.

1474
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:53,960
You got to do the right thing.
That's the bottom line.

1475
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,760
And that's what makes leadership hard.

1476
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:58,310
And sometimes the right
thing is to break rules.

1477
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,980
Sometimes the right thing
is to not follow orders.

1478
01:25:01,070 --> 01:25:03,920
Sometimes orders are wrong
and you shouldn't follow him.

1479
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,650
And Napoleon said,
if you,

1480
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,650
if you're in charge and you get tasked
with something that's wrong and you

1481
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:13,010
execute it, you're culpable. It doesn't
matter if you get ordered or not.

1482
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,413
Okay.

1483
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:19,180
Sometimes you break the rules going right
back to the yes man. Thick, right? Yeah.

1484
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:20,040
And I guarantee,

1485
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:25,200
I guarantee the intent of Stan McChrystal
putting this roe in place wasn't to

1486
01:25:25,201 --> 01:25:28,830
deny guys that were pinned
down by enemy fire. But

1487
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:33,970
again, how are we communicating
it and are we putting,

1488
01:25:34,010 --> 01:25:38,130
so we put in the para priorities in
place correctly so that everybody knows.

1489
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:43,370
Yeah. I mean, you know, um, when it's
put out in an email, it's kind of like,

1490
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:46,130
it's as dangerous as you
interpreting me a text.

1491
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:50,060
I mean, everybody looks at different. Yup.

1492
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,083
Okay.

1493
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:59,510
And you know what, that's why things
like commander's intent are so important.

1494
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:04,250
If I know what it is, like your
eye, if I what it is that you want

1495
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:07,640
done and my job is to get it done and
you give me parameters to do it within.

1496
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:10,070
I'll stay within those parameters
and I'll get the job done.

1497
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:11,030
Okay.

1498
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:12,650
And I'll come back to you
and say, Hey boss, I had to,

1499
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:15,050
I had to bend the rules a little bit here,
but I got the mission done.

1500
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:16,670
Or I might call you back and say,
Hey,

1501
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:19,610
I'm getting ready to break the
rules to get the mission done.

1502
01:26:19,611 --> 01:26:20,840
Do you want me to break them or not?

1503
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:23,110
Okay.

1504
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:27,140
Yeah.
All right.

1505
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:29,181
Back to the book.

1506
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:33,520
Shadow the army outpost on the southern
Ridge replied that the talk at Joyce

1507
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:37,430
said the fire mission was too close to
the village, too close to the village.

1508
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:41,120
Lieutenant Johnson said, if you
don't give me these rounds right now,

1509
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:42,500
I'm gonna die.

1510
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:47,680
Yeah,

1511
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,760
try your best

1512
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:53,510
shadow replied knowing
the talk wouldn't fire.

1513
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:59,500
Try your best.
Try your best.

1514
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:02,103
Okay.

1515
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:07,650
From the tone of shadows voice, I knew
he was on the verge of complete rage.

1516
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,670
He wanted to strangle the officer's in
the talk at Joyce. I felt the same way.

1517
01:27:12,671 --> 01:27:16,090
This couldn't be happening.
We were on the same side.

1518
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:19,840
We weren't marines or soldiers,
we weren't Americans or ask ours.

1519
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:23,650
We were one lone group fighting
desperately to stay alive.

1520
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:26,440
The villages villagers
weren't our friends.

1521
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:29,710
This was a war and my team
was on the verge of dying.

1522
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:34,800
Who side was the talk on
radio call after radio call?

1523
01:27:34,901 --> 01:27:36,940
Swinson kept requesting smoke.

1524
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:41,530
Finally around zero six 30 the talk at
joy's permitted for white phosphorus,

1525
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:45,670
white phosphorus rounds to be fired into
the southeast backside of the village

1526
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:47,770
too far away to conceal my team.

1527
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:49,260
Yeah.

1528
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,200
Those were the last rounds
fired during the battle

1529
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:59,100
that about zero six 40 the talk at Joyce
for obeyed any more artillery support,

1530
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:04,190
citing garbled communications in complete
calls for fire procedures and a lack

1531
01:28:05,131 --> 01:28:08,670
of situational awareness on the
part of those trapped in the valley.

1532
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:12,273
Yeah.

1533
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:15,550
So there's the, there's the
reasons from their perspective.

1534
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:17,933
MMM.

1535
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:18,740
Okay.

1536
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:23,030
Garbled communications in complete
calls for fire procedures and a lack of

1537
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,520
situational awareness on the part
of those trapped in the valley.

1538
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,053
Okay.

1539
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:38,960
Meanwhile, during this time you've been
moving up, grabbing bodies, coming back.

1540
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:40,283
Yep.

1541
01:28:41,210 --> 01:28:44,600
And here we go again as we move forward
for a third time to talk and find the

1542
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:47,180
ordered the army platoon dog
three to to move forward.

1543
01:28:47,181 --> 01:28:50,690
They pulled in behind us with the platoon
leader in a Humvee with an anti tank

1544
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:53,300
tow missile on the roof.
The toe made no sense to me,

1545
01:28:53,301 --> 01:28:56,960
but the truck was equipped with a to
40 machine gun behind them were 20 us

1546
01:28:56,961 --> 01:29:00,440
soldiers and for heavily, heavily
armored vehicles. You Rolling with me,

1547
01:29:00,441 --> 01:29:03,060
lieutenant?
I was confirming what I took for granted.

1548
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,600
I'll scout the route first
before I bring my platoon in.

1549
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:08,190
The terrain may be too tough.

1550
01:29:08,940 --> 01:29:12,420
He refused to put his soldiers into the
Afghan vehicles. I could understand that.

1551
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:17,220
Okay. I go first. I said, you cover our
six, the Afghans, we'll be behind you

1552
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:22,750
as we bounced forward. I heard teen
Monte again come up on the radio.

1553
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:27,160
We were under fire.
Lieutenant Johnson said we're surrounded.

1554
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,010
So now you're heading back in.
Yeah.

1555
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:35,940
Yeah. And I, um,

1556
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,750
and my whole goal was just to get them,
you know, was to get them to the road

1557
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:47,280
and uh, yeah, I mean that was their goal.

1558
01:29:48,610 --> 01:29:51,510
Can you get to the road?
They can get into the vehicles are good.

1559
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,140
It's always trying to push. I thought
that they had took over a house. Right?

1560
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:59,490
Like I thought they had pushed into
the village and took over a house and

1561
01:29:59,491 --> 01:30:03,270
pointed a house and that's what I
thought they had done. And I lost,

1562
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:07,590
I lost communications with them.
So I thought they'd done, you know,

1563
01:30:07,591 --> 01:30:09,690
when a Kenefick was
trying to give that grid,

1564
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:14,190
I was trying to write it down cause
I knew if I could get that grid,

1565
01:30:14,191 --> 01:30:18,210
I'd know where they were at a plot and
I could be there and go get him. And um,

1566
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:20,540
you know,
the,

1567
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,910
the one part I don't talk about it and
there is probably the hardest parts of

1568
01:30:23,911 --> 01:30:24,750
the whole deal is,

1569
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:29,220
is that the first trip that I made in,

1570
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,670
okay.

1571
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,350
I was probably 70,

1572
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:38,900
60 to 70 meters from him.
They're still alive.

1573
01:30:59,170 --> 01:31:01,510
So you're out in the valley now

1574
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:08,760
you're with a group of guys are going
back to the bulkier up bullet had entered

1575
01:31:08,761 --> 01:31:12,080
a Westbrook's neck near the shoulder
blade and ricocheted downward.

1576
01:31:12,081 --> 01:31:13,970
A Dang a dangerous but not fatal.

1577
01:31:13,971 --> 01:31:18,770
Wound Swenson applied quick clot powder
and a bandage to seal off the bleeding.

1578
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,650
The fight had been raging for over
90 minutes and the chain of command

1579
01:31:21,651 --> 01:31:25,610
throughout Kunar province was on alert
procedures for releasing helicopters had

1580
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:28,520
been on snarled and two oh h 58 Kai was,

1581
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:33,700
we're in route to the valley at zero
seven 15 ne contacted Swenson Highlander.

1582
01:31:34,041 --> 01:31:38,480
This is Pale horse. The PC pilot
command radioed, what do you need?

1583
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,460
Pale horse.
Swanson replied,

1584
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:44,780
I'm under heavy fire from the village
and the hills to the east and on both

1585
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:45,171
sides.

1586
01:31:45,171 --> 01:31:49,490
Request immediate suppression of while
we pulled back the Kai Kai was squadron,

1587
01:31:49,491 --> 01:31:51,110
had been in Coonara for 10 months.

1588
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:53,330
The pilot's knew the terrain
and the enemy habits.

1589
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:55,600
They intended to swoop
in low and crisscrossing.

1590
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:59,090
Strafing room runs deliberately
swerving and cutting back at odd.

1591
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:01,720
They didn't care whether
they hit the Douche man,

1592
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:05,740
they wanted to force them to
crouch down and cease firing.

1593
01:32:06,190 --> 01:32:09,640
The aerial tactics would allow the command
group to pull back westward to draw

1594
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:13,030
down under under reduced enemy pressure.

1595
01:32:14,390 --> 01:32:19,390
As Swenson moved, he called for a
medivac shadow. Radioed back to that.

1596
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:22,450
The talk wanted questions
answered before calling for one.

1597
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:27,810
Is he army or marine shadow said
Swinson cursed major Williams was more

1598
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:33,550
diplomatic. This is Fox w six Williams
radioed it doesn't matter his service,

1599
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:36,670
he's us.
There was a pause then shadow.

1600
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:41,140
Reluctantly radioed repeat talk
needs to know if he's army or marine.

1601
01:32:41,620 --> 01:32:43,120
It's in the regulations.

1602
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:48,680
Yeah,
it was um,

1603
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,670
guy calling for medivac and
you're getting asked, hey,

1604
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:57,610
is the person that needs,
is the casualty army or Marine Corps?

1605
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:00,550
Yeah.
And it really didn't matter to him.

1606
01:33:02,630 --> 01:33:05,810
It really did matter to them.
You're saying it mattered.

1607
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:08,690
I'm saying it to who was asking.
They really,

1608
01:33:09,740 --> 01:33:12,440
their decisions were
based off of who it was.

1609
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,400
All right.
Um,

1610
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,760
at this point you're,
you're,

1611
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:32,230
I think you're, you're going back
and forth, going back to the valley,

1612
01:33:32,231 --> 01:33:34,420
getting bodies, helping
wounded. Coming back out.

1613
01:33:34,450 --> 01:33:37,690
You're under fire the whole time
rod is getting after it with you.

1614
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:41,800
Sometimes you have some us people with
you, sometimes you don't. And again,

1615
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:45,430
these are things you have to buy this
book and it to get these details out of it

1616
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:50,140
and read it so you understand the full
magnitude of what we're talking about

1617
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:50,974
here.

1618
01:33:51,900 --> 01:33:52,480
Yeah.

1619
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,380
Going back to the book,

1620
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:58,400
Hafez left the command group to sort
itself out helping a wounded NASCAR was

1621
01:33:58,991 --> 01:34:02,140
headed back west to the operational
release point when I had stopped him.

1622
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,230
I need you to come back in with me.
I can't find them without you.

1623
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:08,200
I said Hafez was married recently.

1624
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,480
He was wounded and exhausted.

1625
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:14,140
He could now go home and have a life.

1626
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:15,150
Yeah.

1627
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:18,570
If today is my time to die,
then I die.

1628
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,980
So He's rolling with you?

1629
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:23,300
He did.
He wrote with me the whole time

1630
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:28,170
again to all those people out there that,

1631
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:35,110
well I guess I should just say for the
people out there that have a hard time

1632
01:34:35,111 --> 01:34:38,440
understanding of what's going
on overseas, um, you know,

1633
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:43,441
here's an Afghan soldier that is now
going to risk his life to help an American

1634
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,610
marine go and find his friends.

1635
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:49,400
Yeah.
Cause we were brothers.

1636
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,450
Going back to the book shortly after
we had it again down the valley,

1637
01:35:02,451 --> 01:35:05,000
we bumped into another group
of rent wounded, ask scars.

1638
01:35:05,390 --> 01:35:09,800
Rod recognize the first sergeant who was
dripping blood down the right side of

1639
01:35:09,801 --> 01:35:14,270
his trousers. He was waving his arms,
be begging us to stop for askers,

1640
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:16,450
hobbled over and threw
themselves into the backseat,

1641
01:35:16,470 --> 01:35:20,570
splashing blood all over the place. We
drove them back to the collection point.

1642
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:24,710
The first sergeant was blubbering beg,
begging us not to go back in.

1643
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:26,870
I was a little rough shoving
him out of the truck.

1644
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:30,170
I was running out of time and patients,
once we drop them off,

1645
01:35:30,350 --> 01:35:32,030
we'd gunned it back down the track.

1646
01:35:35,850 --> 01:35:36,683
Okay.

1647
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:42,350
We were getting to a place
where we couldn't turn
around and couldn't dodge and

1648
01:35:42,351 --> 01:35:45,650
weave the art as the RPG
smoke trails came at us.

1649
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:48,740
We could get pretty stuck in here.
Rod yelled the truck,

1650
01:35:48,741 --> 01:35:52,820
had very little traction and absolutely
no cover then I guess we'll die with

1651
01:35:52,821 --> 01:35:57,320
them. I yelled back, what else could
I say that we weren't going back.

1652
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:00,050
Rod shifted into low gear
and we bounced forward.

1653
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:08,293
You,

1654
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:11,730
I noticed this throughout the book,
you have a hard time.

1655
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:14,310
Like anytime you saw wounded
guys who were like, all right,

1656
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:16,920
well we gotta make another trip
now we've got to make another trip.

1657
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:20,070
Even with those wounded Afghan guys,
like you want to go help your guys.

1658
01:36:20,071 --> 01:36:22,050
But at the same time you see these guys
here like are getting the truck and

1659
01:36:22,051 --> 01:36:26,670
we'll take these guys back. Oh, you've
got a big heart, bro. Got a big heart.

1660
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:30,730
I mean look, you know,
I didn't just lose, um,

1661
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:33,870
I didn't just lose a four guys that day.

1662
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:39,840
I lost 10 guys cause I lost six Afghans.
I lost 10 brothers.

1663
01:36:40,710 --> 01:36:43,260
You know what I mean? I mean, those
guys were just as close to me.

1664
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:48,530
My Afghans were just as close to me
as any marines I ever served with,

1665
01:36:53,230 --> 01:36:55,390
and that's why they're joining
you to go back in there and fight

1666
01:36:55,870 --> 01:37:00,510
the ethics and that's why I'm alive today.
I mean that's,

1667
01:37:00,570 --> 01:37:05,370
that's the relationship that I had with
them and the Brotherhood that I had for

1668
01:37:05,371 --> 01:37:08,780
them with them is why I'm alive today.
I mean they,

1669
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,070
they are incredible human beings.

1670
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:21,830
So you're driving around in here.
Back to the book.

1671
01:37:21,831 --> 01:37:25,580
Only rod scale at the wheel was preventing
me from being hit again and again.

1672
01:37:25,820 --> 01:37:27,890
Bullets make different
sounds when they pass by you.

1673
01:37:27,891 --> 01:37:30,530
The cracks of bullets breaking the
sound barrier mean they're high,

1674
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:32,540
maybe five or 10 feet over your head.

1675
01:37:32,750 --> 01:37:36,320
The bullets at snap close by
your ears are the real killers.

1676
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:40,070
A few losing power and slowing
down made a low buzzing sound.

1677
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:45,140
Strange though it may seem I wasn't
scared or angry. I was beyond that.

1678
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,100
I didn't think I was going to die.
I knew I was dead.

1679
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:53,450
There wasn't anything I could do about it.
I wasn't a thinking human being.

1680
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:57,660
I had gone,
I wasn't firing the machine gun,

1681
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,800
I was the machine gun.
Rod wasn't driving the truck.

1682
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,880
Rod was the truck.
I had melded with my weapon.

1683
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:09,690
I was no more human than a five
foot machine gun. I was embracing,

1684
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,980
we were locked together, metal
and flesh. Without that 50 gal,

1685
01:38:13,981 --> 01:38:18,660
I would have quivered like the ha ha,
scars helpless in the storm.

1686
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,840
But with that weapon,
I felt transported.

1687
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:25,890
I had something to do
until the blackness came.

1688
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:32,530
Yeah. He just kept, I kept like the
bullets were hitting inside the tourists.

1689
01:38:32,570 --> 01:38:36,710
They had elevation on us and still
they were hidden inside the turret.

1690
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:39,410
And um,
man,

1691
01:38:39,411 --> 01:38:44,060
you could hear him coming by and I just,
I remember sitting there,

1692
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:47,360
you know, cause if you get down, I
mean, you know, you, you know, your,

1693
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:51,800
your instinct is to duck down the turret,
but you do that delve around you.

1694
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:54,910
I mean, they were running
at the truck, so yup.

1695
01:38:56,090 --> 01:38:59,990
You ducked down there full sprint and
you're never going to come back up.

1696
01:39:00,020 --> 01:39:04,070
You know what I mean? And, um, I
just kept waiting for a bullet.

1697
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,810
I just knew it was who's
going to hit me in the face.

1698
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:09,890
I just kept waiting for a bullet to
hit me lights out like I just, I just,

1699
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:15,670
there was no doubt in my mind that
I was going to die zero c road out,

1700
01:39:18,170 --> 01:39:19,940
but I was going to make this
son of a bitches, aren't it?

1701
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,540
Yeah.

1702
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:25,590
They had it to do
Jack.

1703
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:34,000
I wasn't paying attention
to the Afghan soldiers.

1704
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:36,850
Rod and I plan to keep driving
east until we obliterated,

1705
01:39:36,910 --> 01:39:41,320
until we were obliterated or we found
my team suddenly with no warning,

1706
01:39:41,321 --> 01:39:45,070
five or six ass cars who were lying in
a terrorist about off a hundred meters

1707
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:45,281
away,

1708
01:39:45,281 --> 01:39:50,140
leapt up and race towards our truck
when wish one was shot back and pitched

1709
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,710
forward. Wham. A second man went
down screaming, Wham, a third,

1710
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,650
then a fourth and a fifth.
I'd never seen anything like it.

1711
01:39:56,651 --> 01:39:58,570
Five men down in five seconds.

1712
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:01,240
There was so much screeching
and shooting that I could,

1713
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:04,780
couldn't pick out the location of a
weapon that had shot them to deliver such

1714
01:40:04,781 --> 01:40:05,830
lethal grazing fire.

1715
01:40:05,831 --> 01:40:09,220
The machine gunner must been hidden only
a few hundred meters away with a clear

1716
01:40:09,221 --> 01:40:11,440
line of sight and his
bi-pod firmly anchored.

1717
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:16,240
Yet whoever shot those men didn't
raise his gun sights and stitch me.

1718
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:20,920
I knew he was looking at
me, but I couldn't see him.
There was nothing I could do.

1719
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:25,510
He let me live, not one of his rounds
even struck our truck. I can't explain it.

1720
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,760
W W we used to call the truck's
bullet magnets. They are,

1721
01:40:30,850 --> 01:40:35,050
I mean it's like the ripest target
and a free gear. The Turret gunner.

1722
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,710
You're like the, the, the icing
on the cake. You're the chocolate.

1723
01:40:37,770 --> 01:40:41,400
The Cherry on the icing on the cake.
Yeah. Cause that truck gets over.

1724
01:40:41,401 --> 01:40:44,560
If they take the gun out, that truck
doesn't come out of their own silver ran.

1725
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:49,350
Oh hell yeah. Yeah. But you
know, even though it's a bullet
magnet, I mean, you know,

1726
01:40:49,351 --> 01:40:53,440
just like right there,
I think that kind of paints the picture.

1727
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:58,810
I mean it's the, it's the only chance you
have, right? I mean you're, you're out.

1728
01:40:58,811 --> 01:41:01,990
I mean, that's how doubting
they are. It's, it's

1729
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:06,990
literally watching guys see people
throw the term miracle around. Yeah,

1730
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:11,280
all the time. Like the fact that you
right here, there's five guys within,

1731
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:11,920
you know,

1732
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,920
spitting distance from you and they all
go down and you're the most prime target

1733
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:19,090
and you and you don't get job in

1734
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:20,531
helpless.

1735
01:41:20,531 --> 01:41:25,531
The most helpless feeling
you got is watching guys
trying to get to you and just

1736
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:30,250
getting mowed down.
I mean,

1737
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:33,670
you want to talk about helpless and you
don't even know where it's coming from.

1738
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:35,081
I mean,

1739
01:41:35,081 --> 01:41:40,081
you want to talk about
helpless is watching another
human being run directly at

1740
01:41:40,121 --> 01:41:40,954
you

1741
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,240
to get help and you're
just watching them just

1742
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:49,980
go down one after the
other after the other.

1743
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:00,980
Can you imagine it dude? Yeah.
It's just the, you know, I'd say

1744
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:07,680
they were good that day.
You get this call from Valdez,

1745
01:42:07,710 --> 01:42:12,210
they're coming at you. I can see them
closing from both sides. They're swarming,

1746
01:42:12,211 --> 01:42:15,090
you know,
in front of our truck,

1747
01:42:15,091 --> 01:42:18,240
I saw few guys sprinting across the
washed from left to right, heads low.

1748
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,970
I don't think they saw us coming up
behind them or if they heard the truck

1749
01:42:20,971 --> 01:42:22,560
engine over the din of the gunfire.

1750
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:26,280
They scurry too quickly for me to get
off a burst. Glancing to my right,

1751
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:30,840
I'd looked smack into the eyes of
five or six men in dirty man dresses,

1752
01:42:30,841 --> 01:42:35,130
crouched alongside a drainage ditch,
not 10 meters away. When I gave them,

1753
01:42:35,131 --> 01:42:37,110
they ducked down like they
were playing hide and seek.

1754
01:42:37,111 --> 01:42:40,890
It took me a few seconds to realize that
they were spreading out to seal off the

1755
01:42:40,891 --> 01:42:45,891
open end of the Horseshoe Valley Zip
locking the frozen as scars inside a fire

1756
01:42:45,961 --> 01:42:49,680
sac.
Rod and I had blundered into their rear,

1757
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:52,550
so they were about to,
they're about to surround everybody.

1758
01:42:52,860 --> 01:42:55,350
That's what they were doing. There
was a trench and they were closing it.

1759
01:42:55,680 --> 01:42:59,580
They're closing the
gate and we that truck,

1760
01:42:59,610 --> 01:43:03,720
you happened to be there to be in it.
Fire Sac is a,

1761
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,430
is a doctrinal term actually,

1762
01:43:05,431 --> 01:43:09,750
which means you're surrounded and they're
going to shoot into the sack and kill

1763
01:43:09,751 --> 01:43:10,160
everyone.

1764
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:10,993
Yeah.

1765
01:43:13,300 --> 01:43:15,620
We are bouncing over the rocks
no faster than a man can run.

1766
01:43:15,621 --> 01:43:19,030
When a bearded Douche man clutching an
AK leapt out of a ditch and sprinted

1767
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,800
after us like a man trying
to catch is a catch a bus.

1768
01:43:22,010 --> 01:43:24,410
My gun almost wouldn't swivel
low enough to shoot him.

1769
01:43:24,411 --> 01:43:26,690
The barrel was tilted down
as far as it could go.

1770
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,530
I fired into his chest and he went
down like you'd hit a glass wall.

1771
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:33,230
The bullet doesn't blow a
man back like in the movies.

1772
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:37,790
Either he stumbles or on or he falls
dead. This man fall, fell dead.

1773
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:42,170
Rod was yelling at me. Maybe I was
hypnotized for a second. By the death,

1774
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:44,840
there was a guy trying
to open the right door.

1775
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:49,080
I couldn't depress the 50 cal bat
low. I can't get him. I yelled,

1776
01:43:49,081 --> 01:43:50,930
the gun won't go down low enough.

1777
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:54,950
It takes the brain 12 thousands
of a second to react to danger.

1778
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,840
My mind was a complete blank.

1779
01:43:57,040 --> 01:44:01,370
I had fired so many thousands of rounds
that I didn't think what I was doing.

1780
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:04,580
Once you've practiced emotion long enough,
it becomes second nature.

1781
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:09,730
Some reachers researchers call
it expertise induced amnesia.

1782
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:14,150
Athletes Call it being in the zone.
I call it self preservation.

1783
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:18,290
I grabbed my m four leaned out and
shot the guy four or five times in the

1784
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:20,450
shoulder and neck.
It was like shooting a Zombie.

1785
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:23,750
There was no shock power and the little
five five six millimeter bullets.

1786
01:44:23,751 --> 01:44:28,350
He felt the ground. I pivoted back
to the 50 Callen, grabbed the spade,

1787
01:44:28,351 --> 01:44:29,910
handle the weapon,

1788
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:34,560
my hands and my eyes were working as a
trained unit independent on my brain, man.

1789
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:38,160
Sight, picture, shoot,
man. Sight picture shoot.

1790
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:41,100
You don't really look at the target.
The enemy remains out of focus.

1791
01:44:41,101 --> 01:44:43,980
You concentrate on the sight
picture, man. Sight picture shoot.

1792
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:48,720
I hit one or two guys next to the truck
and the other's duck back into the ditch.

1793
01:44:49,080 --> 01:44:51,660
Valdez came back on the Radio Rod,
watch your front.

1794
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,530
Rod was focused on keeping traction in
the loose gravel. If the truck got stuck,

1795
01:44:55,531 --> 01:44:57,090
even for a moment,
we'd be toast.

1796
01:44:57,330 --> 01:45:00,950
He looked ahead to see a bearded hatless
man in his mid thirties dressed in a

1797
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:02,160
brick red man,

1798
01:45:02,161 --> 01:45:06,300
jams with a green chest rig full of ammo
running toward the truck and firing an

1799
01:45:06,301 --> 01:45:10,590
eight k at us from the hip.
Hold on, homie. Rod Yelled,

1800
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,520
he hit the accelerator, the truck
at the man squarely in the chest.

1801
01:45:14,521 --> 01:45:19,320
There was a bump and then
another bump under the tires.
Holy Shit, Rod rod yelled.

1802
01:45:19,470 --> 01:45:22,830
I just ran over a guy
back up and do it again.

1803
01:45:26,360 --> 01:45:29,880
I had been shot in the elbow,
a bleeder that did no real damage.

1804
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:34,920
The bone was fine in a fight. Adrenaline
deadens the pain. I did a little rapping.

1805
01:45:34,921 --> 01:45:36,660
It got back to shooting.

1806
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:40,470
The more fucked up things got the
more rod and I started laughing.

1807
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:45,190
He was steering away from RPG streaming
at us and laughing and I was shooting

1808
01:45:45,191 --> 01:45:47,530
the big gun and laughing.
Definitely crazy,

1809
01:45:47,531 --> 01:45:49,420
but your emotions have to go somewhere.

1810
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:51,670
Okay.

1811
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:55,090
The enemy fire slack and on us.
As the Chi was darted around,

1812
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:58,240
they were like a steel umbrella over us.
A few minutes later,

1813
01:45:58,241 --> 01:46:02,290
Pale horse came back on my net.
Three three were Winchester.

1814
01:46:02,410 --> 01:46:06,490
We'll be back in 15 Mike's
Winchester meant they'd
expended all their ammunition.

1815
01:46:06,910 --> 01:46:09,820
They were too light to carry much and
they'd been shooting at targets wherever

1816
01:46:09,821 --> 01:46:13,750
they looked. The firing picked
up. We were again, the pin, Yada.

1817
01:46:14,830 --> 01:46:17,890
I climbed down from the Turret
and talk to talk to Rod and Hafez.

1818
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,790
We had started with six ammo cans.
We are now down to one.

1819
01:46:21,791 --> 01:46:25,870
I had fired more than 2000
rounds. Guys, we need a new gun.

1820
01:46:25,871 --> 01:46:28,960
I said it was three steps forward,
two steps back. As we turned,

1821
01:46:28,961 --> 01:46:31,990
I saw and ask our free crawling
feebly toward the road.

1822
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:36,310
We stopped and I hopped out a PKM machine.
Gun was tilling the ground around me,

1823
01:46:36,311 --> 01:46:38,470
so I dodged back and
forth until I reached him.

1824
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,370
One Kiowa out of ammo hovered
above me and distracted the enemy.

1825
01:46:42,371 --> 01:46:45,070
Ignoring the RPG shells
exploding in the air.

1826
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:47,590
I turned the asker onto his back,

1827
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:50,280
hit by three rounds in
his upper chest and neck.

1828
01:46:50,281 --> 01:46:55,050
He was gurgling and drowning in his
own blood. I rolled him onto his side

1829
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:58,360
and he died before I could pick them up.

1830
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:04,653
Okay.

1831
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:08,913
Yeah.
Like

1832
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:13,530
you can see I kind of circle things
that I'm going to read. Yeah.

1833
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:17,320
And I just was like circling
giant chunks. Yeah, too.

1834
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:20,650
So people can understand what I mean.
I,

1835
01:47:20,651 --> 01:47:22,790
I know that people aren't
going to understand really the,

1836
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:26,100
the kind of chronological evolution
and maybe the mechanics of what was

1837
01:47:26,101 --> 01:47:26,491
happening,

1838
01:47:26,491 --> 01:47:29,580
but I want people at least understand
until they read this book themselves to

1839
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:33,810
freaking situation that you were in,
which was beyond mayhem.

1840
01:47:35,130 --> 01:47:38,190
Yeah. You know, you talk about training
and life to the worst case scenario.

1841
01:47:38,220 --> 01:47:39,780
I always had done the same thing.

1842
01:47:41,730 --> 01:47:45,450
And this was worst than any worst
case scenario that I could have ever,

1843
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,600
ever dreamed up of.
I've ever been in.

1844
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:53,840
There was the worst of any situation
I could have never sit here.

1845
01:47:54,481 --> 01:47:58,290
And you said, gimme the worst
thing you could just come up with.

1846
01:47:58,291 --> 01:48:03,090
And I could have never done it. I could've
never, I could have never done it,

1847
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:07,890
uh, of just, I mean, you
just, I mean it's just like,

1848
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:12,740
I mean, I just felt like
everybody was dying. Like,

1849
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,300
I mean it was just,
I mean,

1850
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:20,270
there were like literally there
were bodies everywhere, Eh, Eh,

1851
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:23,820
I mean you couldn't turn around and
look and are not be a body somewhere.

1852
01:48:27,690 --> 01:48:28,523
Okay.

1853
01:48:28,790 --> 01:48:33,320
And you just pretty much figured you were
going to be joining them soon enough.

1854
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,810
No, I did. I mean, there was no
doubt. There was no doubt in my mind.

1855
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:40,590
I wasn't making it out of there.
And you know,

1856
01:48:40,591 --> 01:48:44,250
I walked in that day and this
just shows you how ignorant I was.

1857
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:48,810
Like when you talk about, oh, your buddy
who was kind of like, puff the chest up,

1858
01:48:48,811 --> 01:48:53,700
right. I had that with me. I literally,
I'm a, I'm going to tell you,

1859
01:48:53,701 --> 01:48:58,560
I'm going to just tell you how ignorant
I was. I walked in that day and I, I, I,

1860
01:48:58,770 --> 01:49:03,390
there was not a situation that I was
ever going to see that I couldn't get us

1861
01:49:03,391 --> 01:49:07,080
out of. There wasn't
one, there wasn't one.

1862
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:14,510
And it was like,
you know,

1863
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:17,930
it was like God showing
me just how small it was.

1864
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:29,950
No, you got to take, I mean,
these, these Afghan soldiers,
I mean they're my buddies,

1865
01:49:31,390 --> 01:49:33,970
you know, and part of the problem,
what was the long and the deployment,

1866
01:49:33,971 --> 01:49:38,380
was this supposed to been nine months
and how long this, when did this happen?

1867
01:49:39,580 --> 01:49:41,990
We got there in July.
August. September. Yeah.

1868
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:45,610
So this is like two months or three
months into deployment. Yeah. And I'm,

1869
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,980
part of the problem was we'd just done the

1870
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,940
NATO transition and they were using
weapons systems that they weren't used to

1871
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:57,580
that shoot a smaller
round. Yeah. Yeah. A lot.

1872
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:02,530
But they weren't used to these weapons.
They weren't even used him for us. I mean,

1873
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:05,830
I knew him for us are so much more fickle.

1874
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:10,040
M 16th and six [inaudible] six things
are even more so than an m four m six

1875
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:13,540
things are so much more fickle than an
hey k they must've been cursing them.

1876
01:50:13,541 --> 01:50:18,250
Damn. May 16th they were,
I mean, they were, oh yeah.

1877
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:20,230
I mean they,
you know,

1878
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:23,140
that they would have something go wrong
and they would just drop the magazine.

1879
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:25,240
I mean,
I mean they were just,

1880
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:28,423
yeah,

1881
01:50:28,590 --> 01:50:28,981
so there is,

1882
01:50:28,981 --> 01:50:33,981
so like I'm telling you if you say
everything like we had just so we just hit

1883
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:38,230
Ramadan, so none of them
were drinking water. None of
them were eaten. We had just,

1884
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:40,210
I mean,
you look at every factor to this.

1885
01:50:40,211 --> 01:50:42,750
It was the perfect storm and
we had just transitioned.

1886
01:50:42,751 --> 01:50:46,480
This is the first mission at first or
second mission that we had ever went on

1887
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:51,220
with all NATO weapons. I mean, you
look at all these factors and it was,

1888
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:52,540
it was perfect.

1889
01:50:53,650 --> 01:50:56,770
Had you ever worked with the QRF before?

1890
01:50:58,340 --> 01:51:01,750
Not that one. I was used to the ones,
you know, up near where we were at.

1891
01:51:01,820 --> 01:51:06,630
Do you hadn't had done no interoperability
with those guys before? No. And uh,

1892
01:51:07,180 --> 01:51:10,150
they got shut down. So after the
talk, learn that it was marines,

1893
01:51:11,170 --> 01:51:14,260
they got shut down,
all support stopped.

1894
01:51:17,970 --> 01:51:19,920
All sports stopped.
Cool.

1895
01:51:28,770 --> 01:51:29,603
Okay.

1896
01:51:29,750 --> 01:51:31,550
All right.
Um,

1897
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:38,400
Tom Toms, I got nothing to
say and that's one of them.

1898
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:39,910
I can't even comprehend that.

1899
01:51:41,140 --> 01:51:41,973
Yeah.

1900
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:46,670
All right.
We're going back to the book.

1901
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:49,400
We turned left out of the
wash onto the narrow track.

1902
01:51:49,401 --> 01:51:52,880
Back to the casualty collection point.
I looked around for major Williams.

1903
01:51:52,881 --> 01:51:55,460
He was sitting off to one side,
wounded in in shock.

1904
01:51:55,700 --> 01:51:58,700
There were four or five vehicles and
at least 20 ass cars milling around.

1905
01:51:58,970 --> 01:52:01,820
These were our Afghans.
We'd come down from Monte together.

1906
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:04,970
I glanced hopefully from the group,
from group to group.

1907
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:07,730
Hafez was asking if they'd
seen Lieutenant Johnson.

1908
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:09,800
They say lieutenant is back in Ganja Golf.

1909
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:12,860
How fast said the team didn't make it out.

1910
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:14,873
Shit.

1911
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:21,230
Somewhere farther up the wash.
My team was fighting to stay alive.

1912
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:27,070
I'd promise to get them and rod and I
had the only gun truck willing to enable

1913
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:28,393
to go in.

1914
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:32,960
I climbed down from the Turret
and ran over to the asker.

1915
01:52:33,110 --> 01:52:35,510
He'd taken a bullet in the fight
and he was slowly bleeding out.

1916
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:38,780
I kept a stack of tourniquets in
my med and knew how to apply them.

1917
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:41,600
I wrapped a tourniquet around
his thigh and my frustration.

1918
01:52:41,601 --> 01:52:45,440
I twisted it extra tight and he screamed.
How tell him to up.

1919
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:50,070
I said hurting is better than dying.
If you're a grunt,

1920
01:52:50,071 --> 01:52:52,080
you'll come face to face
with horrendous Gore.

1921
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:55,500
You have to steel yourself to seeing
mangled bodies and smelling blood.

1922
01:52:55,770 --> 01:52:58,650
Doctors and nurses cope with
screaming and suffering every day.

1923
01:52:58,950 --> 01:53:00,630
I had dressed out dozens of deer.

1924
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:04,500
You learn to disassociate from the task
when you're pulling out warm guts are

1925
01:53:04,501 --> 01:53:08,460
cutting off slabs of dripping, meet
with the blood, sticking to your hands.

1926
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:15,130
He went through something
like 15 tourniquets.

1927
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:19,230
Yeah.
At least quite a few vowels and morphine.

1928
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:21,223
MMM.

1929
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:23,160
A couple of neat needle decompressions.

1930
01:53:24,300 --> 01:53:25,133
MMM.

1931
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:30,340
NPA is quite a few NPH nasal.

1932
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:34,933
Okay.

1933
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:36,500
The quiet.

1934
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:40,760
The Chi was at rearmed and come back
on station directing us toward another

1935
01:53:40,761 --> 01:53:44,330
wounded. Like it or not, we had been
pressed into ambulance business.

1936
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:49,190
The Kiowa commanded by chief
warrant officer. Yes. Syrian Salono,

1937
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:50,790
a good name for guide.

1938
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:55,040
A crazy war had been a marine grunt
before becoming an army pilot.

1939
01:53:56,150 --> 01:54:00,290
His bird was easy to talk to and he
directed me where to go sometimes hovering

1940
01:54:00,291 --> 01:54:03,230
so low I could just about
reach up and touch his skids.

1941
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:06,860
He was covering my rear area.
When I got out of the truck,

1942
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:10,370
the pilots were fearless
knowing my team was lost.

1943
01:54:10,371 --> 01:54:14,120
They were running search patterns 20 feet
off the ground so they could identify

1944
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:14,954
each body.

1945
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:20,070
Damn. Yeah. I mean, and he did that like,
you know, they were so his commander,

1946
01:54:20,071 --> 01:54:23,790
he was having problems with his commander
and the guy who was leading those

1947
01:54:23,791 --> 01:54:27,090
birds, you know, cause they fly
in two birds and a fill the,

1948
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:30,510
but when I told him that
it was marines missing,

1949
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:37,380
he dropped down and covered me the
whole time. You ever meet him? Yeah.

1950
01:54:37,770 --> 01:54:41,920
Yeah. Yeah. He's incredible.
I just seen him, um,

1951
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:47,580
I seen him like around thanksgiving.
Yeah. He is an incredible human being.

1952
01:54:48,830 --> 01:54:51,720
Just so everyone knows like just cause
you're in a helicopter does not make you

1953
01:54:51,721 --> 01:54:53,760
safe at all.
Especially a Kiowa.

1954
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:56,220
Like maybe you're a little bit safer
and Apache cause you got some armor.

1955
01:54:56,340 --> 01:54:58,650
I don't know how much, how much
orders in a Kiowa. Zero. Right.

1956
01:54:58,651 --> 01:54:59,484
They look like little

1957
01:54:59,940 --> 01:55:04,800
and I don't know how many he is. Bird
was shot to shit. No kidding. Yeah,

1958
01:55:05,610 --> 01:55:07,890
yeah, yeah. It was shot to pieces.

1959
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:13,303
Okay.

1960
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,820
I climbed up a terrorist wall
and followed the contours,

1961
01:55:15,830 --> 01:55:19,780
the field around a corner to find a body
lying face down on the man's hands were

1962
01:55:19,781 --> 01:55:21,190
green gloves with the fingers cut.

1963
01:55:21,340 --> 01:55:24,610
I knew before I even rolled
him over that it was Daud Ali,

1964
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:29,110
my closest Afghan friend.
He was due to take leave in a few weeks.

1965
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:33,130
He had left on bad terms with his
mother who was sure he would be killed.

1966
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:35,680
Finally,
after two years,

1967
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:39,700
she had relented and invited him
back to the farm for a visit.

1968
01:55:40,540 --> 01:55:44,160
He'd been hit in the face.
When looked at his dole lies.

1969
01:55:44,161 --> 01:55:47,490
I lost my concentration and knelt
there for a moment, oblivious.

1970
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:51,210
He was a little guy too
small for his body armor.

1971
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:56,190
He and I had rigged up two tourniquets
to hold the body armor in place close to

1972
01:55:56,191 --> 01:55:59,850
his chest.
I knelt down to untie the tourniquets.

1973
01:56:00,180 --> 01:56:05,180
I needed them for other guys and I needed
to get the heavy armor off him so I

1974
01:56:05,731 --> 01:56:06,870
could carry him to the truck.

1975
01:56:09,960 --> 01:56:14,760
I felt a tap as something hit my left
shoulder. It didn't register at first.

1976
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:16,770
It was like I'd been
hit with a Lightstone.

1977
01:56:16,950 --> 01:56:20,040
I glanced up to see a tough looking
Afghan with a long black beard.

1978
01:56:20,041 --> 01:56:24,930
Glatt glaring down at me. He was wearing
a dirty gray man dress, a flak jacket,

1979
01:56:24,931 --> 01:56:28,620
and an Afghan Hornby helmet.
He was pointing an AK at my head,

1980
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:32,430
gesturing for me to stand
up in broken English.

1981
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:36,000
He was telling me to drop
my rifle, come. He said,

1982
01:56:36,001 --> 01:56:38,670
waving the barrel of
his eight K in my face.

1983
01:56:40,590 --> 01:56:42,540
I couldn't believe that
I'd screwed up so badly.

1984
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:48,290
All I could think of was that my head
would be sawed off and held up on TV.

1985
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:50,973
No Way.

1986
01:56:52,350 --> 01:56:57,270
I die right where I was right now. I
had been dead for a few hours. Anyways,

1987
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:58,890
the borrowed time was up.

1988
01:56:58,891 --> 01:57:03,840
That's all my rifle was resting on my
left thigh, pointing in his direction.

1989
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:07,080
The stubby grenade launcher was
attached to the underside of the barrel.

1990
01:57:08,040 --> 01:57:11,220
I raised one arm like I was going to
surrender and pulled the trigger of the

1991
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:12,600
launcher with my free thumb.

1992
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:16,500
The 40 millimeter grenades shot
forward two feet to his armored vest.

1993
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:20,730
It didn't explode. Instead it knocked
him back, stunned him with the,

1994
01:57:20,820 --> 01:57:23,670
with the breath slammed out of him.

1995
01:57:23,671 --> 01:57:26,940
He staggered back and fell on
his side for a few seconds.

1996
01:57:26,941 --> 01:57:29,460
I thought the blow had killed him.
No such luck.

1997
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:34,950
I pushed myself erect as I pushed myself
a he June, a big breath and stirred.

1998
01:57:35,160 --> 01:57:38,220
I kicked out his face, losing my
balance and falling on top of him.

1999
01:57:38,430 --> 01:57:40,020
We were both on the ground wrestling.

2000
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:44,430
Afghan tribesman have legs like steal
from climbing mountains all day all their

2001
01:57:44,431 --> 01:57:47,970
lives. So I had to keep his legs off
me. I pinned his elbows and blocked.

2002
01:57:47,971 --> 01:57:49,260
His reach for is eight K.

2003
01:57:49,410 --> 01:57:53,940
I was pushing my helmeted head into his
chest so he couldn't gouge my eyes any

2004
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:54,331
second.

2005
01:57:54,331 --> 01:57:58,290
I figured that grenade would explode
and both of us could stop worrying about

2006
01:57:58,291 --> 01:57:59,124
any of this.

2007
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:03,690
I called the ground with my right hand
and found a rock the size of a baseball.

2008
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:06,720
I clutched it and swung
by blindly at his face.

2009
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:11,280
The blow stunned him before he could
recover. I Pour, pushed off of his chest,

2010
01:58:11,281 --> 01:58:14,730
lifted the rock high and my right fist
and smashed it down like a hammer,

2011
01:58:14,731 --> 01:58:18,480
breaking his front teeth. He looked me in
the eyes, the fight knocked out of him,

2012
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:21,930
his head not moving.
We both knew it was over.

2013
01:58:22,740 --> 01:58:26,490
I drew back my arm and drove the stone
down, crushing his left cheekbone.

2014
01:58:27,210 --> 01:58:31,680
He went limp. I pushed up on my
knees and I hit him with more force.

2015
01:58:32,190 --> 01:58:36,570
The blow caved in the left side of his
forehead. I smashed his face again.

2016
01:58:36,571 --> 01:58:39,900
And again,
driven by pure animal rage.

2017
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:57,540
That's close combat obviously when
you're killing another human being with a

2018
01:58:57,541 --> 01:58:58,374
rock.

2019
01:58:58,420 --> 01:58:59,253
Yeah.

2020
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:06,010
Yeah. It's real. Um,

2021
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:12,950
you know, I just, I just remember
his face, you know, and uh,

2022
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:17,860
I mean, look, God, let me just
state this up front. First off,

2023
01:59:17,861 --> 01:59:21,420
I feel no remorse at all.
Um,

2024
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:26,950
but I think it was at, it was at that,
at that point to where it humanized it.

2025
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:29,950
Does that make sense? Like, it humanized

2026
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:34,600
the fact of taking another person's life,
like out.

2027
01:59:34,620 --> 01:59:39,270
Remember the look in his eyes
when he knew he was gonna die.

2028
01:59:39,990 --> 01:59:43,650
And at that point, like, you know, I
obviously I didn't think of it then,

2029
01:59:44,250 --> 01:59:46,980
but you know, when I still see that
face, I still think about, you know,

2030
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:48,540
he was a father.

2031
01:59:48,930 --> 01:59:51,990
There was somebody at home that wanted
him to come home just as bad as somebody

2032
01:59:51,991 --> 01:59:56,580
wanted me to come home. Um,
you know, whether you agree
with his beliefs are not,

2033
01:59:56,581 --> 01:59:59,340
people don't agree with their beliefs
and you know, but at the end of the day,

2034
01:59:59,341 --> 02:00:04,050
he believed in his beliefs just as much
as I did. Um, we're both human beings.

2035
02:00:04,710 --> 02:00:09,710
We're both fighting for a
cause that neither one of
us can see that we both just

2036
02:00:09,841 --> 02:00:14,700
believe in. Um, and it had to be one of us

2037
02:00:17,060 --> 02:00:20,180
in my guesses, and you
can, maybe I'm wrong,

2038
02:00:20,181 --> 02:00:25,181
but my guess is the reason he didn't just
straight kill you is because you had,

2039
02:00:26,661 --> 02:00:28,760
you had the drop on you. Yeah. And, and,

2040
02:00:28,790 --> 02:00:33,790
and having you as a trophy in an orange
jumpsuit would've have been much more

2041
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:38,990
impactful for him and their costs.
Yeah. I mean, he could have easily,

2042
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:42,110
um, it would have took him no
time to get me across the border.

2043
02:00:42,111 --> 02:00:44,180
We were right on the border.
That's what he would've done.

2044
02:00:44,181 --> 02:00:46,740
He would've took me across the
board. He just told me, um,

2045
02:00:46,760 --> 02:00:49,580
and he would have been a hero.
He'd probably been promoted
and whatever, you know,

2046
02:00:49,581 --> 02:00:52,630
network he was in. I mean, he
would have been the man and, um,

2047
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:57,200
I was worth a lot more to him alive
than I was dead. And I, you know, but,

2048
02:00:57,450 --> 02:01:00,160
but then on the backside, I
mean, I've questioned it so
many times, like, you know,

2049
02:01:00,161 --> 02:01:03,410
it was it that or was it the maybe
maybe he was trying to bluff me,

2050
02:01:03,411 --> 02:01:07,280
didn't have bullets to me. I don't know.
I don't, I don't know. Like, and you know,

2051
02:01:07,490 --> 02:01:10,550
there's so many times in this whole
battle that I just wonder like,

2052
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:14,430
like, why, why, why not me,

2053
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:20,360
you know, uh, I mean, war and I gets,
you could apply this to all life,

2054
02:01:20,361 --> 02:01:25,190
but it becomes very clear at war, it's
like inches, millimeters. You know what,

2055
02:01:25,490 --> 02:01:28,070
what? Sure. You could
say he got missed by,

2056
02:01:28,640 --> 02:01:31,790
by around by a foot a couple of inches.

2057
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:34,130
But when you take that
back to a person's weapon,

2058
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:37,310
you got missed by a millimeter a of aim.

2059
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:39,853
That's what it is.

2060
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:40,873
You could have got,

2061
02:01:41,020 --> 02:01:46,020
you could have got missed by a
gust of wind and [inaudible].

2062
02:01:47,060 --> 02:01:51,440
Literally you could have, you could
have been missed by the wind picking up.

2063
02:01:55,700 --> 02:01:57,350
So while all that's going on.

2064
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:58,913
Okay,

2065
02:01:59,730 --> 02:02:03,690
back to the book. Highlander was the
radio call sign for Captain Swenson.

2066
02:02:03,870 --> 02:02:05,910
He was trying to gather reinforcements.

2067
02:02:05,911 --> 02:02:09,120
He pulled aside the lieutenant in
charge of the Quick Reaction Platoon,

2068
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:12,030
mount up Swenson's and told him,
you're no help back here.

2069
02:02:12,090 --> 02:02:14,160
We need your fire power.
I can't.

2070
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:17,430
Lieutenant said the tox says
we're to cover the vehicles.

2071
02:02:18,230 --> 02:02:21,600
Swenson grabbed the lieutenant's
50 watt radio and called the Joyce.

2072
02:02:22,020 --> 02:02:26,860
The talk told the platoon to
move into the valley, Swenson,

2073
02:02:26,980 --> 02:02:27,670
Fabio,

2074
02:02:27,670 --> 02:02:32,620
rod and how Fez then hopped into an
undamaged Tom the to drive back in,

2075
02:02:33,490 --> 02:02:35,890
but the platoon did not follow.
Instead,

2076
02:02:35,891 --> 02:02:39,790
the platoon leader again called back to
Joyce and somehow received permission to

2077
02:02:39,791 --> 02:02:41,530
remain in the rear.
Out of the fight.

2078
02:02:45,630 --> 02:02:50,520
Yeah. It was frustrating. It was
frustrating. It was frustrating that,

2079
02:02:53,550 --> 02:02:57,600
you know, and I, I, I met
that guy a few years ago.

2080
02:02:58,020 --> 02:02:59,670
We ran into,
we were in the same meeting.

2081
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,193
MMM.

2082
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:07,190
It was frustrating. Every bit of it
was frustrating. It was so, I mean,

2083
02:03:07,191 --> 02:03:11,930
every single bit of it was unnecessary,
unnecessary and frustrating.

2084
02:03:21,190 --> 02:03:25,870
Back to the book, I started the day with
14 or 16 tourniquets. I use them all.

2085
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:30,820
I put four on one guy who'd lost his
left arm and his left leg below the knee.

2086
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:33,620
He survived.
One ask are shot in the neck.

2087
02:03:33,621 --> 02:03:35,740
Sounded like he was
slurping through a straw.

2088
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:39,160
There was nothing I could do except
listen to him. Strangled to death.

2089
02:03:42,490 --> 02:03:46,600
Yeah. At 1.2 FTE f fifteens
roared low through the valley,

2090
02:03:46,601 --> 02:03:49,600
opening their afterburners to
create a hell of a lion's roar.

2091
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:53,150
The pilot's wouldn't drop any bombs.

2092
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:03,380
Yeah. I mean, and you know, usually,
but at this point, you know,

2093
02:04:03,381 --> 02:04:05,870
the only show of force
ever works is, is, I mean,

2094
02:04:05,871 --> 02:04:09,170
they had so much momentum at this time.
I mean, it was like momentum. Right.

2095
02:04:09,260 --> 02:04:12,770
So it started out as fighters, like his
fighters that came across the border.

2096
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:16,010
And then what it turned into was when
they seen that we weren't getting the

2097
02:04:16,011 --> 02:04:18,980
support and when they seen that we weren't
getting control of the situation and

2098
02:04:18,981 --> 02:04:21,830
fires weren't coming,
they escalated and they gained momentum.

2099
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:24,680
What everybody else joined in,
you take the,

2100
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:29,120
so you had the guys that showed up to
fight and then you have the opportunist of

2101
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:33,350
the villagers that turn into fighters
instantly because they have the upper hand

2102
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:37,560
and so they start gaining momentum of
more people fighting you every minute.

2103
02:04:37,650 --> 02:04:38,060
Cause I was,

2104
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:40,140
I got to do is pick up the gun off
the dead person. You know what I mean?

2105
02:04:40,770 --> 02:04:45,100
Literally. I mean there were
literally women run in through uh,

2106
02:04:45,240 --> 02:04:50,220
the village with the like these
bowls and you know, you look at them,

2107
02:04:50,240 --> 02:04:52,160
you know, well, you know,

2108
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:56,550
she's just a woman with a
ball running rocket comes in,

2109
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:59,520
she drops the ball and it's
full of grenades and ammunition.

2110
02:04:59,530 --> 02:05:03,030
The women were running up and re
re supplying all of these guys.

2111
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:13,350
The Kai is Kai was, we're still
supporting you back to the book.

2112
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:14,640
Inside the villages,

2113
02:05:14,730 --> 02:05:19,680
the army pilots ran astonishing risks
to find my team or co a Kiowa would

2114
02:05:19,681 --> 02:05:24,600
swooped down toward the compound flare
back at rooftop level and potter down the

2115
02:05:24,601 --> 02:05:26,280
alleyways at 20 miles an hour,

2116
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:30,720
allowing the pilots to peer into
every backyard in, into every window.

2117
02:05:32,260 --> 02:05:32,680
Yeah.

2118
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:36,310
As the day grew hotter, we gradually
cleared the valley of casualties.

2119
02:05:36,311 --> 02:05:38,590
Over 30 wounded or dead were evacuated.

2120
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:46,380
We watched a Salono.

2121
02:05:46,381 --> 02:05:50,220
The lead pilot brought us Chi went down
to a few feet above a trench and Hubbard

2122
02:05:50,221 --> 02:05:55,110
there. Highlander. We spotted five bodies.

2123
02:05:56,790 --> 02:05:57,810
I'd heard all I needed.

2124
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:01,590
I jumped out the door and sprinting
across the field to the right,

2125
02:06:01,591 --> 02:06:04,410
opening some distance
before Swenson yelled at me.

2126
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:09,330
I ignored him knowing he'd be
right behind me. A PKM shifted me,

2127
02:06:09,810 --> 02:06:12,060
shifted to me when I was
halfway across the terrorist.

2128
02:06:12,061 --> 02:06:17,010
I hopped over a terrace wall and fell
into a deep well constructed trench.

2129
02:06:20,870 --> 02:06:23,900
I landed next to Dani
Johnson and my heart stopped.

2130
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:29,160
He was lying on his back with his
arms out, spread his eyes open.

2131
02:06:30,300 --> 02:06:30,600
Okay,

2132
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:32,790
but never to see anything
again on this earth.

2133
02:06:34,500 --> 02:06:35,760
A few feet further on,

2134
02:06:36,090 --> 02:06:40,170
I came across the body of
an Afghan interpreter who
had traveled with our team.

2135
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:46,240
I felt sick to my stomach.
I knew what I would see next.

2136
02:06:49,650 --> 02:06:52,380
Lieutenant Johnson lay on his
back with his eyes closed.

2137
02:06:53,610 --> 02:06:54,190
Okay.

2138
02:06:54,190 --> 02:06:57,520
He looked peaceful despite the
entry wounds in his right shoulder.

2139
02:06:59,590 --> 02:07:03,730
Doc Layton and lay on top of him with
medical supplies scattered around.

2140
02:07:05,820 --> 02:07:06,810
I rolled him over.

2141
02:07:08,680 --> 02:07:11,560
Doc had taken a three round
burst in the right cheek

2142
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:18,930
off to the right staff sergeant
can AFIC was lying face down.

2143
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:23,220
His gps with a busted screen
clenched in his left hand.

2144
02:07:24,590 --> 02:07:26,240
His mouth was open and full of dirt.

2145
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,133
Okay.

2146
02:07:27,800 --> 02:07:29,960
I think he was yelling
out his grid location.

2147
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:34,130
The numbers I heard over the radio four
hours earlier when he was shot in the

2148
02:07:34,131 --> 02:07:34,964
back of his head,

2149
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:44,780
the team was wiped out.
Their bodies were stiff and cold.

2150
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:47,990
Most of their gear was gone.
Weapons, helmets, radios.

2151
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:51,560
The two 40 machine gun was missing,

2152
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:56,330
but Lieutenant Johnson's pack
was filled with link Ammo.

2153
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:00,860
No one had fired the gun.
I was supposed to be caring.

2154
02:08:07,710 --> 02:08:09,630
I had never believed
it would end like this.

2155
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:14,430
My mind refuse to accept what
I was seeing. Hour after hour,

2156
02:08:14,431 --> 02:08:18,630
I'd imagined them holed up inside a
stone house, shielded from RPG blast,

2157
02:08:18,631 --> 02:08:21,420
exchanging gunfire with
the Douche men who were,

2158
02:08:21,690 --> 02:08:26,370
who knew better than to rush them.
Swenson was standing above the trench.

2159
02:08:26,550 --> 02:08:30,210
We were taking random incoming and he was
watching for movement among the houses.

2160
02:08:31,050 --> 02:08:34,380
He talked into his radio for a few seconds
and bent down and picked up some of

2161
02:08:34,381 --> 02:08:36,420
the teams. Gear. He didn't say a word.

2162
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:39,640
He left me alone with them,

2163
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:41,980
okay?

2164
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,620
I always did the staff sergeant
over my roles, right shoulder.

2165
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:48,550
He was heavy and I fell.
Once he landed on top of me,

2166
02:08:49,750 --> 02:08:52,780
I got up and carried
him to an Afghan truck,

2167
02:08:52,810 --> 02:08:54,790
carefully talking him into the open bed.

2168
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:56,380
Okay?

2169
02:08:56,380 --> 02:09:00,340
I stood there for a minute, suddenly
beat as I turned away from the truck,

2170
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:05,290
half has put his hand on my shoulder.
The Asghar say,

2171
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:08,980
you carried out, they're dead.
Now they want to help you.

2172
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:15,130
Five or six of us returned to the trench
while the damn PKM kept shooting at us.

2173
02:09:16,770 --> 02:09:19,320
I carried Dani Johnson back the ass cars,

2174
02:09:19,321 --> 02:09:24,320
took Lieutenant Johnson and Doc Leighton
Swenson loved back the rest of the

2175
02:09:24,321 --> 02:09:25,154
equipment.

2176
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:26,113
Okay.

2177
02:09:26,790 --> 02:09:31,790
After six hours it was over and I
felt empty as a balloon without air.

2178
02:09:34,770 --> 02:09:39,540
Hafez took me aside. They've
gone to a better place. He said,

2179
02:09:39,780 --> 02:09:42,990
don't cry the ass cars.
We'll take it as weakness.

2180
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:46,450
No Way.
I was going to cry,

2181
02:09:46,690 --> 02:09:49,480
but at that moment I didn't feel
like killing new anyone either.

2182
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:51,880
I wasn't angry or bitter,

2183
02:09:52,060 --> 02:09:55,840
just deflated and exhausted as the wide
run a marathon and couldn't remember why

2184
02:09:55,841 --> 02:09:56,710
I wanted to do it.

2185
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:02,680
I was too damn tired to
stand still taking fire.

2186
02:10:02,681 --> 02:10:05,320
We left the valley in a
convoy of about four trucks.

2187
02:10:05,500 --> 02:10:09,700
Rod stopped near the casualty collection
point where we talked with Captain

2188
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:11,410
Kaplan and Captain Ed,
Corporal Norman,

2189
02:10:11,530 --> 02:10:13,870
who had walked down from
their observation posts,

2190
02:10:14,470 --> 02:10:19,180
Staff Sergeant Valdez and Miller radio
that they were coming down from their

2191
02:10:19,181 --> 02:10:21,190
perch to everyone was accounted for.

2192
02:10:22,450 --> 02:10:25,990
We had shuttled in and out of the valley
five, six or seven times that morning,

2193
02:10:25,991 --> 02:10:29,620
depending on which one of us you asked.
It was all a fog.

2194
02:10:31,570 --> 02:10:36,140
No senior American or pursuit
force had come forward from camp.

2195
02:10:36,141 --> 02:10:36,974
Joyce.

2196
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:43,520
Captain Swenson said he would try to
wrap things up half as an I climbed into

2197
02:10:43,621 --> 02:10:46,170
the back of an Afghan truck
carrying my dead brother's

2198
02:10:48,350 --> 02:10:52,190
I held staff sergeant can affect with my
left hand and Lieutenant Johnson rested

2199
02:10:52,191 --> 02:10:56,630
on my right arm.
As we bounced down the track,

2200
02:10:57,380 --> 02:10:59,450
we passed.
Villagers returning to God your golf.

2201
02:11:01,280 --> 02:11:04,130
Some started to laugh,
pointing out my dead friends.

2202
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:06,910
I reached for my rifle.

2203
02:11:08,590 --> 02:11:13,200
Don't half ass said holding my arm,
not worth it.

2204
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:19,220
When we arrived back at Camp Joyce,

2205
02:11:20,120 --> 02:11:22,620
I walked into the battalion
aid station to get bodybags.

2206
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:26,000
Major Williams rushed up and clutched it.

2207
02:11:26,001 --> 02:11:28,910
My body armor tell me they're
not all dead. Not all of them.

2208
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:30,690
Okay,

2209
02:11:30,690 --> 02:11:33,300
they're all dead.
I said removing his hand.

2210
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:39,750
I walked outside where my friend
Sergeant Charles Bogus was waiting.

2211
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:43,820
Boca said,
I'll give you a hand.

2212
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:47,980
We walked back to the bodies.

2213
02:11:49,490 --> 02:11:50,323
Okay,

2214
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:51,840
sergeant major Jimmy Carr.

2215
02:11:51,841 --> 02:11:56,841
Bellow the top enlisted men at Joyce
hastened up and put his hands firmly on my

2216
02:11:57,151 --> 02:12:00,420
shoulders trying to steer me away.
You don't have to do this devil dog.

2217
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:06,390
My guys will make sure it's done right.
That wasn't how to end it.

2218
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:08,273
If I had died,

2219
02:12:08,550 --> 02:12:11,910
I'd want Lieutenant Johnson and staff
sergeant can affect to put me in the bag.

2220
02:12:12,240 --> 02:12:13,610
I'll finish it.
I said

2221
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:18,670
bogus and I carried the bodies

2222
02:12:20,820 --> 02:12:22,920
back next to the freezers.

2223
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:27,240
Take off their battle gear and dig
through their pockets marking items for

2224
02:12:27,241 --> 02:12:28,500
shipment to their families.

2225
02:12:29,900 --> 02:12:34,100
I take a Chevron from Staff Sergeant
Kenefick and attach it to my dog tags.

2226
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,450
Yeah,

2227
02:12:35,450 --> 02:12:39,410
40 we had started out not liking
each other a thousand years ago.

2228
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:51,520
We cleaned them up as best we can,

2229
02:12:52,570 --> 02:12:56,380
wiping the blood and dirt off their faces,
taking off their field gear,

2230
02:12:56,560 --> 02:13:01,560
straightening out their camouflage
uniforms and placing each in a black body

2231
02:13:01,811 --> 02:13:06,000
bag.
We mark the name,

2232
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:10,170
got the head draping
American flag over each bag,

2233
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:12,810
bow our heads in prayer

2234
02:13:16,430 --> 02:13:17,780
and drive them out to the Hilo.

2235
02:13:17,781 --> 02:13:22,781
Pat Gone to gall was one of the
deadliest small arms battles.

2236
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,160
Nope.
The Afghanistan

2237
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:32,993
war.

2238
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:34,960
Okay.

2239
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:38,140
We lost five advisors in
addition to team Monte,

2240
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:42,940
army sergeant first class Westbrook,
a died of his wounds.

2241
02:13:44,220 --> 02:13:46,030
Eight ask.
Ours were killed in 13.

2242
02:13:46,031 --> 02:13:49,030
Seriously wounded by rifle
machine gun and RPG fire.

2243
02:13:50,660 --> 02:13:51,030
Okay.

2244
02:13:51,030 --> 02:13:54,610
The enemy losses to small arms.
We're probably have a similar number.

2245
02:13:54,820 --> 02:13:57,190
There were no ids,
no bombs,

2246
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:02,770
and very few artillery shells.
Bullets caused most of the casualties.

2247
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:06,520
Ganja gall was a mountain
fight from an earlier century.

2248
02:14:15,190 --> 02:14:16,023
And

2249
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:26,380
it's a fight from an earlier century.

2250
02:14:28,320 --> 02:14:29,153
But uh,

2251
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:40,613
yeah,

2252
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:46,460
but some things don't change.
That's a fact.

2253
02:14:52,850 --> 02:14:55,280
Yeah, it was a, Gosh,

2254
02:14:58,550 --> 02:15:02,870
you know, I say it and I don't think
people understand it, but do you know,

2255
02:15:02,960 --> 02:15:06,380
I might not physically died that day,
but I died

2256
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:12,200
right there next to him.
I mean, you talk about,

2257
02:15:14,150 --> 02:15:18,400
you know,
I mean,

2258
02:15:18,401 --> 02:15:22,570
it's one thing to lose one person,
but everybody,

2259
02:15:23,290 --> 02:15:27,830
I mean, it's uh, Eh,

2260
02:15:27,980 --> 02:15:32,630
I mean,
I mean that's the worst case scenario.

2261
02:15:34,430 --> 02:15:36,620
You're living it. Do you know
what I mean? You're literally,

2262
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:41,690
you don't even have anybody from your
own team to put your dad on the bird.

2263
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:46,850
Do you know?
And you know,

2264
02:15:49,050 --> 02:15:53,940
how old were you at this point?
2121 years old.

2265
02:15:54,540 --> 02:15:57,720
2121.

2266
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:04,110
You know, and I, I don't know if it
talks about it in the book, you know,

2267
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:07,380
after I did that with my teammates,

2268
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:11,780
I went straight from
there and I went to um,

2269
02:16:11,880 --> 02:16:16,880
so are the Afghan side and I
did it with all their guys too.

2270
02:16:18,810 --> 02:16:23,810
And usually what they do with their guys
is they just call the families and they

2271
02:16:23,981 --> 02:16:27,630
got so many days to come get
him and I wasn't allowing that.

2272
02:16:27,720 --> 02:16:31,060
I went back and I took body bags up
there and we gave them the exact same

2273
02:16:31,061 --> 02:16:34,780
respect that we gave my guys and we put
them in the freezers until our families

2274
02:16:34,781 --> 02:16:38,920
came and got him.
And you know,

2275
02:16:38,921 --> 02:16:39,790
I didn't go,

2276
02:16:40,390 --> 02:16:44,560
I didn't go start worrying about my
stuff until we had taken care of all the,

2277
02:16:45,550 --> 02:16:48,730
all the guys, you know, and it's just,

2278
02:16:49,060 --> 02:16:53,170
it was his long day.
A long day.

2279
02:16:54,450 --> 02:16:55,283
Okay.

2280
02:16:57,160 --> 02:16:57,993
And

2281
02:17:01,910 --> 02:17:02,770
I mean,

2282
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:06,530
you do, you, you're just like, okay.

2283
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:08,970
Yeah.

2284
02:17:08,970 --> 02:17:12,090
You still have a job to do. Yeah. So,

2285
02:17:12,630 --> 02:17:14,580
I don't know if it talks about
it in there, but that, you know,

2286
02:17:14,581 --> 02:17:19,581
they tried to put me on the helicopter
with him to go back to a bog room and

2287
02:17:20,011 --> 02:17:24,000
then wanted me to fly home to do the
ramp ceremonies and he wanted me to fly

2288
02:17:24,001 --> 02:17:24,834
home with them

2289
02:17:28,020 --> 02:17:28,853
and

2290
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:33,850
I actually put them on there and
I told him I would be right back.

2291
02:17:33,851 --> 02:17:36,010
And I knew those birds had to take AUC.
Same words,

2292
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:39,590
the PJ's weren't going to sit on
the flight line very long and I,

2293
02:17:39,591 --> 02:17:43,180
I just made sure that I knew that they
had took off before I got around anybody

2294
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:46,630
else because I mean,
they were dead. I mean,

2295
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:48,310
I still had guys who still needed me

2296
02:17:50,050 --> 02:17:54,930
and they didn't need me
anymore. And so I, you know,

2297
02:17:56,890 --> 02:18:00,640
you know, I knew my Afghan soldiers
needed me. They needed to see that,

2298
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:04,540
that they weren't alone. They needed to
see that, that we're in this together,

2299
02:18:04,790 --> 02:18:09,670
you know? And that was what, that was
what mattered to me. But what the guys,

2300
02:18:09,671 --> 02:18:10,570
I still had left.

2301
02:18:12,530 --> 02:18:14,250
How did the Afghan,

2302
02:18:14,280 --> 02:18:19,280
your Afghan soldiers respond
to this whole situation?

2303
02:18:19,890 --> 02:18:20,160
You know,

2304
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:24,720
sometimes in Iraq there'd be a mass
casualty like this and we'd lose a whole,

2305
02:18:24,840 --> 02:18:28,860
there was actually in Ramadi, we lost a
whole battalion. They all, they all left.

2306
02:18:28,920 --> 02:18:33,560
Yeah, they quit. Yeah. What were your
guys did? How did it affect them?

2307
02:18:35,520 --> 02:18:36,353
Okay.

2308
02:18:36,770 --> 02:18:39,590
I mean, they stuck it out.
You know, they stuck it out.

2309
02:18:42,330 --> 02:18:43,163
MMM.

2310
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:46,010
They did. I mean, I'm
telling you that your,

2311
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:49,040
they are some of the most incredible
human beings I've ever seen. You know,

2312
02:18:49,041 --> 02:18:52,010
we come in and deploy,
we're there for a certain amount of time.

2313
02:18:52,011 --> 02:18:56,030
They live at forever. And, uh,
they responded. I mean, they,

2314
02:18:57,700 --> 02:19:01,600
you know, they, they got their
shit together. Um, and yeah,

2315
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:07,130
I mean, we were back in the
fight three days later, you know,

2316
02:19:07,131 --> 02:19:09,860
and they don't get, they
don't get to risk, but they
don't get the support we do.

2317
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:14,900
You know, they don't get, I mean,
they don't get anything we get,

2318
02:19:14,901 --> 02:19:19,270
you know what I mean? [inaudible]
and it's just, you know, but we,

2319
02:19:19,310 --> 02:19:23,630
but we stuck together, you
know, they helped me, they
helped me get through it. Um,

2320
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:24,620
and I hope I helped them,

2321
02:19:24,621 --> 02:19:27,940
but I think the most incredible
thing was it was that point that,

2322
02:19:28,750 --> 02:19:32,420
that they brought me into there.
I was accepted as one of them.

2323
02:19:32,421 --> 02:19:33,450
You were one of them.
Yeah.

2324
02:19:34,190 --> 02:19:38,900
And that was probably the most rewarding
piece of it to me. You know, was it, I,

2325
02:19:39,650 --> 02:19:44,090
I had finally proven myself to
them that, that I was, one of them

2326
02:19:48,080 --> 02:19:51,820
in deployment wasn't over yet.
And you know,

2327
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:54,540
there was more fighting to be done.

2328
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:59,360
Going back to the book army,

2329
02:19:59,420 --> 02:20:02,690
an army convoy had been
ambushed north of Monte,

2330
02:20:02,750 --> 02:20:04,580
lieutenant colonel and Captain Brian,

2331
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:07,520
the company commander were
on their way to assist.

2332
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:11,090
I look to colonel you who nodded
in agreement minutes later.

2333
02:20:11,091 --> 02:20:16,091
You Bakis Staff Sergeant Richards and
some of the colonel's guys that came with

2334
02:20:16,521 --> 02:20:21,050
him, uh, doesn't ask ours and
I, we're headed out the gate.

2335
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:28,210
Or basically what you run into
is there's a, uh, a huge kind of,

2336
02:20:29,050 --> 02:20:31,210
what did somebody hit an IED?
Is that what had happened?

2337
02:20:31,300 --> 02:20:33,940
It was all day ambush aside this and they,
what they done,

2338
02:20:33,960 --> 02:20:36,820
they blew the Jingo trucks up and
block the road. So that, you know,

2339
02:20:36,821 --> 02:20:41,821
they intertwine those Jingo trucks
and between the u s convoy and it's so

2340
02:20:42,641 --> 02:20:47,350
stupid. And so the jingle truck is
blown up and it's blocking the road.

2341
02:20:47,351 --> 02:20:48,700
So guess what happens?
The rest of them,

2342
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:52,510
they're all sitting and you can't go
around it because it's about a 250 foot

2343
02:20:52,511 --> 02:20:55,780
drop off into the Kunar river on the side.

2344
02:20:55,781 --> 02:20:57,940
So they're stuck on the side of this.

2345
02:20:57,941 --> 02:21:00,370
And I've been listening to it
on the radio for a long time

2346
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:03,280
and I knew they were
going to get slaughtered.

2347
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:06,130
I knew that you weren't just going to
sit there and they had buttoned up.

2348
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:10,360
So that's what you were talking about
earlier. You buttoned up and you wait,

2349
02:21:10,361 --> 02:21:11,640
well now they're going to maneuver on.
Yep.

2350
02:21:11,680 --> 02:21:13,540
And that's what they were doing fire
though. And that's what they were doing.

2351
02:21:13,541 --> 02:21:17,980
So the guys in the Jingo trucks
had jumped out. And, uh, I kept,

2352
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:20,070
I kept asking over the radio,
you know,

2353
02:21:20,230 --> 02:21:24,130
cause I could monitor and I kept asking
over the right and I could see the smoke

2354
02:21:24,131 --> 02:21:24,451
from where,

2355
02:21:24,451 --> 02:21:29,330
how his head and I kept asking over the
radio show is a clip platoon and I cat a

2356
02:21:29,350 --> 02:21:31,810
combat logistics patrol.
And I kept asking over the radio,

2357
02:21:31,811 --> 02:21:33,160
how many rounds have you fired?

2358
02:21:33,430 --> 02:21:38,250
Cause I was afraid they were
gonna get low on Ammo. Zero. Damn.

2359
02:21:39,700 --> 02:21:39,840
Okay.

2360
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:40,920
So that's when you rolled out.

2361
02:21:42,930 --> 02:21:43,763
Yeah.

2362
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:47,830
You get out there and this is
three days after Ganja Gall Damn

2363
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:54,430
pkms and a case we're hammering down on
this mess with little return fire would

2364
02:21:54,431 --> 02:21:58,690
be crazy to drive into that tangle of
vehicles. Is it bogus or Bach is focus.

2365
02:21:58,930 --> 02:22:01,660
Focus focus was on the
mark 19 on our truck.

2366
02:22:01,810 --> 02:22:03,640
He couldn't shoot because
of the angles of fire.

2367
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:05,770
Richard stayed in the driver's seat wide.

2368
02:22:05,771 --> 02:22:09,550
Vance on foot by bounds into
the wreckage our ass cars.

2369
02:22:09,551 --> 02:22:11,080
Ron Ran forward with us,

2370
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:14,260
but they're light [inaudible] sixteens
didn't impress the Taliban machine gun

2371
02:22:14,261 --> 02:22:18,010
crew. I was quickly pinned behind
us. Disabled truck looking up.

2372
02:22:18,011 --> 02:22:22,060
I could see the P cam was shooting from
a thick stone house 200 meters up slope.

2373
02:22:22,390 --> 02:22:25,830
I actually needed to have a targets.
I excited to have his target so close.

2374
02:22:25,831 --> 02:22:29,280
I fired about five shells from my grenade
launcher before my common sense kicked

2375
02:22:29,281 --> 02:22:32,970
in. What am I doing? I thought I'm out
bad outmatched by a machine gun, but he,

2376
02:22:33,040 --> 02:22:37,320
there's an army Humvee sitting next to
me with no one in the 50 cal turret.

2377
02:22:38,310 --> 02:22:41,610
You run over there, man. You're 50
calla yelled at where logistics came.

2378
02:22:41,611 --> 02:22:42,540
The muffled reply.

2379
02:22:42,570 --> 02:22:46,110
We don't fight some supply guys
can't wait to get into the action,

2380
02:22:46,111 --> 02:22:47,970
but not this gang.
I wasn't worried though.

2381
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,720
Wild Man Kerr would soon
have air on station.

2382
02:22:52,770 --> 02:22:54,510
Bodies were scattered all over the road.

2383
02:22:54,511 --> 02:22:58,860
All civilians lying face down next to
me alongside the army truck was a skinny

2384
02:22:58,861 --> 02:23:02,370
teenager and a tee shirt bleeding from
shrapnel in his chest and his left arm.

2385
02:23:02,580 --> 02:23:06,270
He was a pathetic sight sprawled on
his back and his filthy brown shorts,

2386
02:23:06,870 --> 02:23:11,250
an orange tip needle protruding from
above his heart and a plastic stopper

2387
02:23:11,251 --> 02:23:15,330
shoved above his left nostril.
He didn't weigh as much as I ate in a day.

2388
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:19,560
His hands and feet were uglier than the
dirt from his efforts to crawl out of

2389
02:23:19,561 --> 02:23:22,050
the line of fire.
He wasn't old enough to grow a beard,

2390
02:23:22,051 --> 02:23:25,410
but he had a full shock of black hair.
Not a bad looking kid.

2391
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:29,520
Once he was cleaned up at the aid station
and had some ice cream, he'd be okay.

2392
02:23:30,420 --> 02:23:34,290
I felt good. In fact, I was pumped.
I had applied dozens of tourniquets,

2393
02:23:34,291 --> 02:23:37,710
but this was the first time I had smelled
death his out and that's cause you

2394
02:23:37,711 --> 02:23:42,080
needled him down and I didn't cover that
part yet. A sucking chest wound and you,

2395
02:23:42,120 --> 02:23:46,500
you gave mud decompression.
I had saved a human being,

2396
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:47,611
a poor,

2397
02:23:47,611 --> 02:23:52,611
scrawny kid eking out a living by driving
a banged up truck pass known ambush

2398
02:23:52,861 --> 02:23:54,450
sites.
What do you eve,

2399
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:57,600
what do eventually join the Taliban
and betray and American convoy?

2400
02:23:57,810 --> 02:24:02,040
I had no idea. Sure. Some of the villages
at Gone Juggalo had been real pricks,

2401
02:24:02,041 --> 02:24:05,700
but why should I hold it against this kid?
I ran back down the road,

2402
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:08,850
hoisting up another wounded truck
driver and carried him back.

2403
02:24:09,090 --> 02:24:10,950
Then I stopped to check on the skinny kid.

2404
02:24:11,130 --> 02:24:14,790
I wanted a pat him on the shoulder to
make myself feel good for my supposedly

2405
02:24:14,791 --> 02:24:17,850
wonderful deed.
Only he was dead.

2406
02:24:19,110 --> 02:24:21,570
He had bled to death from
the wound to his left arm.

2407
02:24:21,900 --> 02:24:23,970
The crew in the army truck
had let him bleed out,

2408
02:24:23,971 --> 02:24:27,300
not five feet away because he was
an Afghan and they were afraid,

2409
02:24:28,920 --> 02:24:29,753
dammit.

2410
02:24:31,830 --> 02:24:34,830
The Afghan drivers were all huddled
together in a ditch by the river.

2411
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,430
The ambush had been sprung
about 90 minutes earlier by now.

2412
02:24:38,431 --> 02:24:42,180
They had pissed themselves dry and had
nowhere to go. I banged my rifle on.

2413
02:24:42,330 --> 02:24:43,290
I'm being my rifle,

2414
02:24:43,291 --> 02:24:47,700
but on an army truck yelling to the
soldiers to open up at least give me some

2415
02:24:47,701 --> 02:24:51,630
water for those poor bastards.
I shouted. A sheep is medic,

2416
02:24:51,631 --> 02:24:56,270
got out of the truck with several bottles
of water and his med pack and ran over

2417
02:24:56,290 --> 02:24:56,940
the ditch.

2418
02:24:56,940 --> 02:25:01,200
I knelt there looking at the blood stage
stains from the kid right beside the

2419
02:25:01,201 --> 02:25:05,610
truck door. I banged on the steel
door again. It opened a crack.

2420
02:25:06,300 --> 02:25:08,730
Fuck you.
I said to the captain inside

2421
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:18,270
as the traffic jam was sorted out,
Cornell,

2422
02:25:18,271 --> 02:25:20,940
you and I walked back to
our home v the dead kid,

2423
02:25:21,090 --> 02:25:24,340
kid lay on the hood and rather
ride to base with a corpse

2424
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:28,630
between us. We wedged the body in
the trunk. Sometimes you laugh,

2425
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:30,310
sometimes you want to cry

2426
02:25:32,130 --> 02:25:34,800
before dropping the
shell down a mortar tube.

2427
02:25:35,820 --> 02:25:37,950
The gunner levels the bubbles on his site.

2428
02:25:38,580 --> 02:25:42,570
If he loses the bubbles than the
tube is pointed at a crazy ankle

2429
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:47,280
after ganja juggle.
I was losing the bubble.

2430
02:25:51,380 --> 02:25:56,020
So investigations take place.
There's actually a, you know,

2431
02:25:56,170 --> 02:26:00,770
accusations and excuses. And one of the
terms that that wasn't there, that was it.

2432
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:04,760
There was, it was being said that
there was four battle management. Yeah.

2433
02:26:06,170 --> 02:26:10,760
And you're talking to a psychologist
onsite at this time and you know,

2434
02:26:10,761 --> 02:26:14,690
that's some of the support you were
talking about that we might have an Afghan

2435
02:26:14,691 --> 02:26:18,540
kid and the Afghan army might not have.
And it was a feat.

2436
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:20,990
Was it a female captain,

2437
02:26:20,991 --> 02:26:24,560
Katie cop and she was making
some assessments? Yeah,

2438
02:26:26,420 --> 02:26:29,060
back to the book. It's true. I
didn't feel connected with others.

2439
02:26:29,480 --> 02:26:32,870
The askers were smoking Hash jabbering
on their cell phones and wandering around

2440
02:26:32,871 --> 02:26:35,720
and flip flops. The American
soldiers were playing video games,

2441
02:26:35,721 --> 02:26:38,420
stuffing themselves at dinner,
laughing too loudly at nothing.

2442
02:26:38,990 --> 02:26:40,190
We weren't fighting a war.

2443
02:26:40,250 --> 02:26:44,480
We were holding a few acres of dirt
while the war swirled around outside our

2444
02:26:44,481 --> 02:26:49,160
barbed wire. There were
Douche mean in every valley.
Drink tea with the villagers.

2445
02:26:49,340 --> 02:26:53,690
Pay $40 for a chicken. We were in
Kumar to fight. Let's get it on.

2446
02:26:54,650 --> 02:26:55,880
That was my attitude.

2447
02:26:56,240 --> 02:27:00,530
The psychologist insisted that I go back
to the states for treatment. No thanks.

2448
02:27:01,040 --> 02:27:04,190
As a captain, she had the rank
to make a recommendation stick,

2449
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:07,400
but she wanted my agreement.
So she challenged me.

2450
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:11,720
We would play a game of ping
pong. If I won, I could stay.

2451
02:27:13,040 --> 02:27:14,300
I lost by one point.

2452
02:27:15,020 --> 02:27:19,640
She was very good and she really was
worried about me and cared about me.

2453
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:20,900
I knew that,

2454
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:21,733
okay.

2455
02:27:22,430 --> 02:27:23,810
It was my time to go home

2456
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:30,560
ping pong game.
Was she like a Legit Ping Pong player?

2457
02:27:30,630 --> 02:27:35,430
No, I thought I had her. You know,
I was the only, uh, you know,

2458
02:27:35,431 --> 02:27:39,120
it was either, you know, I, um,

2459
02:27:40,470 --> 02:27:43,770
it was probably best I went home.
Uh,

2460
02:27:45,690 --> 02:27:50,160
I would say if it wasn't, if I didn't
go home, I, I would've never came home.

2461
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:53,880
Um,
you know,

2462
02:27:54,120 --> 02:27:59,070
I was just getting wound tighter
and tighter. I mean, I was,

2463
02:28:01,170 --> 02:28:05,460
you couldn't tell me, you
couldn't tell me. I was not,

2464
02:28:05,550 --> 02:28:09,810
I wasn't, I wasn't command like you
couldn't, you couldn't tell me what to do.

2465
02:28:09,900 --> 02:28:14,580
You were out of control. I was, I was out
of control. Yeah. Uh, I mean, you know,

2466
02:28:14,581 --> 02:28:19,260
I wasn't doing anything,
nothing, you know, a morally
unethical, right. Like nothing.

2467
02:28:19,261 --> 02:28:22,310
I was doing my job,
but as far as like commanding

2468
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:26,600
me, you couldn't, you, you were going
to do what you were going to do.

2469
02:28:27,050 --> 02:28:31,760
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I was, you know,
I was at the point to where I had no,

2470
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:36,680
I had no, uh, I didn't trust my
command. I didn't trust anybody.

2471
02:28:36,681 --> 02:28:40,240
I didn't trust anybody who's gonna. I
mean, it was, uh, I was the one, you know,

2472
02:28:40,250 --> 02:28:42,870
not a one man. I was a three man
operation. Right. I mean I was,

2473
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:46,460
but I was a one man. I was a one man
wrecking crew. Right. Like I was,

2474
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:51,150
I mean I was going to do, you aren't going
to tell me anything. I mean there was,

2475
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:54,680
it was, it was pretty bad. I mean,
I was fighting and how, you know,

2476
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:55,603
the fist fighting.

2477
02:28:56,780 --> 02:28:57,120
Okay.

2478
02:28:57,120 --> 02:28:58,390
Uh, you know, how much the last guy,

2479
02:28:58,400 --> 02:29:02,330
how much longer was it that you actually
lost the ping pong match and got sent

2480
02:29:02,331 --> 02:29:02,640
home?

2481
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:06,420
I lost it. Right. Um, a couple of
days before thanksgiving. Okay.

2482
02:29:06,690 --> 02:29:10,070
So it was like you were, you were there
for another, what's Thanksgiving meal and,

2483
02:29:10,090 --> 02:29:14,670
and, yes, and we fought her ass
off the whole time. The whole time.

2484
02:29:14,671 --> 02:29:16,140
It was,
it was,

2485
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:21,260
we fought our asses off almost every
single day and sometimes three and four

2486
02:29:23,041 --> 02:29:26,940
times a day. Well, that momentum
that you talked about in the valley,

2487
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:29,430
they built it. It keeps coming. Right.

2488
02:29:29,550 --> 02:29:33,010
It keeps coming cause right after that
they overrun Keating right after. I mean,

2489
02:29:33,011 --> 02:29:35,490
it's all of that, all of it, you know,

2490
02:29:35,491 --> 02:29:38,730
they just built so much momentum
and they were hammering us.

2491
02:29:38,731 --> 02:29:41,600
I mean hammering us every day and um,

2492
02:29:43,090 --> 02:29:46,210
you don't hate it was,
it was pretty bad.

2493
02:29:48,670 --> 02:29:51,760
So you get sent home here. We go back to
the book. When I got home in December,

2494
02:29:51,761 --> 02:29:53,280
I felt like I landed on the moon.

2495
02:29:54,510 --> 02:29:55,250
Okay.

2496
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:58,760
Everyone around me was excited
about football, Christmas
and other normal things.

2497
02:29:58,970 --> 02:30:01,880
I was looking at the clapboard
houses and the cars thinking, man,

2498
02:30:01,881 --> 02:30:05,720
that's so flimsy. They wouldn't give
cover worth shit in a firefight.

2499
02:30:06,740 --> 02:30:10,040
It was an exposed feeling and
where where my machine guns,

2500
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:12,950
I found my old pistol and kept
her around like a rabbit's foot,

2501
02:30:12,951 --> 02:30:16,040
but I missed my two forties
and my 50 cows something awful.

2502
02:30:17,650 --> 02:30:21,850
It seems weird, I'm sure. But I
really just wasn't buying that.

2503
02:30:21,851 --> 02:30:26,050
There wasn't some enemy about to come
over the green hills and I felt so

2504
02:30:26,051 --> 02:30:29,500
unprepared.
I wouldn't be any good to protect anybody.

2505
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:34,300
I was soon sent off to Fort Thomas,
Kentucky for Ptsd therapy.

2506
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:38,080
Maybe that would settle me down and let
me get some sleep and stop feeling so

2507
02:30:38,081 --> 02:30:40,120
depressed and angry at every little thing.

2508
02:30:40,540 --> 02:30:44,200
Some guys really go nuts when they come
back and I wasn't in danger of that,

2509
02:30:44,201 --> 02:30:48,310
but I could feel the kind of crazy
things that maybe got the better of them.

2510
02:30:50,220 --> 02:30:54,420
You're over there long enough and under
such constant battle stress that it

2511
02:30:54,421 --> 02:30:56,430
resets all your settings the way,

2512
02:30:56,850 --> 02:30:59,910
way into the red and they're
very hard to set back.

2513
02:31:00,180 --> 02:31:05,180
The main thing knowing was that I didn't
get my friends out as I had promised.

2514
02:31:09,420 --> 02:31:14,110
I had spent a good part of my 21 years
being pretty critical of other people who

2515
02:31:14,111 --> 02:31:19,111
failed at their responsibilities and now
it was all coming back on me and a dump

2516
02:31:19,861 --> 02:31:20,694
truck.

2517
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,040
Everyday.

2518
02:31:32,040 --> 02:31:35,700
The psychologist urged us to step back
and identify why we were experiencing

2519
02:31:35,701 --> 02:31:37,470
negative emotions.
In other words,

2520
02:31:37,471 --> 02:31:41,190
take a minute to really be conscious of
the emotion instead of just letting it

2521
02:31:41,191 --> 02:31:44,580
seep in.
Don't let your mind stay in neutral.

2522
02:31:44,760 --> 02:31:46,560
Watch your thoughts and by the way,

2523
02:31:46,561 --> 02:31:50,370
I'm hitting this stuff pretty hard because
a lot of people that listen to this

2524
02:31:50,700 --> 02:31:54,180
podcast, yeah are, are, are
thinking these things right here.

2525
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:58,290
I think that's an important part.
Don't let your mind stay in neutral.

2526
02:31:58,380 --> 02:31:59,730
Watch your thoughts.

2527
02:32:00,180 --> 02:32:04,470
Refusing to get out of bed or go to work
or smile at others are all decisions.

2528
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:05,461
Find the reasons,

2529
02:32:05,461 --> 02:32:09,750
those decisions and turn negative
feelings into positive actions.

2530
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:12,240
It's not enough to identify
why you're feeling bad.

2531
02:32:12,241 --> 02:32:15,930
It's about having the character to do
something positive, to take up that space.

2532
02:32:16,230 --> 02:32:21,000
Don't wallow in your misery, which is
just selfish, childish shelf absorption.

2533
02:32:22,110 --> 02:32:23,190
It was all good stuff.

2534
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:27,660
All I ever need is a good operating
manual through you're getting some good

2535
02:32:27,661 --> 02:32:28,480
instructions.

2536
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:31,000
Yeah. Not with, you know,

2537
02:32:31,001 --> 02:32:33,760
I can't say that the end of
the PTSD center helped me,

2538
02:32:34,090 --> 02:32:35,770
but what it did is it educated me,

2539
02:32:36,200 --> 02:32:41,200
it educated me on why I was feeling
the way I was and what it was,

2540
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:45,910
and then therefore that helped
me deal with it. Right. Um,

2541
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:50,560
it Kinda like, you know, uh,
you know, you, you, you know,

2542
02:32:50,620 --> 02:32:54,400
Kinda like how you know your diet
that works for you. Hmm. You know,

2543
02:32:54,401 --> 02:32:57,670
like you can look in the mirror, are you,
how you feel after you eat it. Right?

2544
02:32:57,700 --> 02:32:59,140
Yeah.
It's kind of the same thing.

2545
02:32:59,141 --> 02:33:04,141
Like it educate you on why your body's
doing this or why you're having this

2546
02:33:04,361 --> 02:33:07,330
reaction, you know, and, and that
it's normal and it's just, you know,

2547
02:33:07,331 --> 02:33:10,520
and this is why it's doing it and this
is how you help counter it. Right.

2548
02:33:10,750 --> 02:33:14,620
And that was kind of, that was kind
of what it did for me. It didn't,

2549
02:33:15,940 --> 02:33:18,490
I don't think it really, it
didn't, it didn't fix anything.

2550
02:33:18,670 --> 02:33:20,560
It just educated me on
what the problem was.

2551
02:33:20,650 --> 02:33:24,100
So you could start to identify
the problem. Yes. So I
could identify the problem,

2552
02:33:24,101 --> 02:33:28,180
I could identify why I was feeling
this way, and then, you know,

2553
02:33:28,181 --> 02:33:30,510
I could make decisions based of,
of how I

2554
02:33:31,240 --> 02:33:34,000
was that when you look at the
root of that problem, yeah.

2555
02:33:34,130 --> 02:33:37,660
What was it that feeling of like, hey,
the, the promise that you made was,

2556
02:33:37,661 --> 02:33:38,650
I'll get you guys out.

2557
02:33:38,870 --> 02:33:42,170
No, I mean, no, I mean the facts of
the facts are like, here, here's,

2558
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:46,700
I get so frustrated with people who want
to, like, I'm, I'm a factual guy. Like,

2559
02:33:46,701 --> 02:33:50,070
you know what I mean? I, I'm, everything
to me is black and white and, and I'm,

2560
02:33:50,071 --> 02:33:54,650
I'm in fact base. Like I, I went in
that day to go get my teammates out.

2561
02:33:55,790 --> 02:34:00,530
I failed, I failed. There's
no, you can't jump around it.

2562
02:34:00,531 --> 02:34:04,100
You can't, you can't ignore the
facts of what happened. I failed.

2563
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:05,390
I failed miserably.

2564
02:34:08,950 --> 02:34:13,390
And so, you know, you, if you tell you,

2565
02:34:13,391 --> 02:34:18,010
if I tell myself I didn't fell,
I lie, I'm lying to myself. So

2566
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:20,640
for me, you know, um,

2567
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:25,120
I failed,
I was tested and I failed

2568
02:34:25,510 --> 02:34:26,343
and

2569
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:31,560
now I have to figure out what to do
with that. And that's part of it,

2570
02:34:33,960 --> 02:34:36,990
you know, and, and that, and that's where
I get so upset about like, you know,

2571
02:34:37,020 --> 02:34:40,200
the counselors or whatever. Right. It's
not, well you didn't fail. No, no, no.

2572
02:34:40,260 --> 02:34:45,000
Like as soon as they say that to me,
hi, Yay, I'm done. I'm done. Cause no,

2573
02:34:45,210 --> 02:34:49,680
that's, I'm not going to lie to myself.
I failed and now I need to deal with it.

2574
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:54,750
I need to deal with it.
You know, I can't lie.

2575
02:34:55,890 --> 02:34:59,000
And, and that's, and I
mean look, I mean it's,

2576
02:35:00,720 --> 02:35:05,010
I always say the equivalent to try to
make people understand like how to,

2577
02:35:05,070 --> 02:35:09,120
how I feel about it in this
situation is it would be like

2578
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:15,990
you inside of a house and your family's
there and the house catches on fire

2579
02:35:17,700 --> 02:35:21,180
and you end up getting out
thinking that maybe they're all out

2580
02:35:22,740 --> 02:35:25,260
and you can't get back in there
and they all burned to death.

2581
02:35:27,730 --> 02:35:28,270
Okay.

2582
02:35:28,270 --> 02:35:31,720
That's kind of the equivalent of it.
And you know,

2583
02:35:31,721 --> 02:35:33,670
so I just have to deal with it and,
and you know,

2584
02:35:34,750 --> 02:35:37,990
I deal with it the best I can every day.
I learned from it.

2585
02:35:38,860 --> 02:35:43,660
I try to turn it into something good,
but at the end of the day I still failed.

2586
02:35:44,710 --> 02:35:45,543
And

2587
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:50,280
you know, that's, that's the way it goes.

2588
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:02,800
Going back to the book,
ma'am,

2589
02:36:05,530 --> 02:36:07,360
after my two months at the clinic,
Mike,

2590
02:36:07,540 --> 02:36:11,560
my enlistment term was
in fact coming to an end.

2591
02:36:12,460 --> 02:36:16,780
It didn't take a genius to see it. I'd
be be, and I'd end up behind a desk.

2592
02:36:16,810 --> 02:36:20,170
So I chose not to reenlist.
I love the core. So it hurt.

2593
02:36:21,370 --> 02:36:25,330
Before joining the corps, I had
three concussions, mononucleosis,

2594
02:36:25,450 --> 02:36:29,170
and an operation on my right knee.
When I mustered out four years later,

2595
02:36:29,530 --> 02:36:33,340
I'd added two operations on my right
hand or right road or rotator cuff

2596
02:36:33,341 --> 02:36:36,940
operation, a fourth concussion
from an RPG, a dislocated shoulder,

2597
02:36:37,090 --> 02:36:42,070
and two herniated discs from
clumsily lifting the dead
and wounded one vertebrae.

2598
02:36:42,130 --> 02:36:43,260
Given Wayne Ganja gold.

2599
02:36:43,261 --> 02:36:46,690
When I picked up an ask aren't
slipped in the bloody mud under him.

2600
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:50,380
I have no idea when the second
vertebrae went out during the battle,

2601
02:36:50,920 --> 02:36:53,500
I had that nick and my arm
from a bullet or shrapnel,

2602
02:36:53,740 --> 02:36:54,970
but that hadn't been anything.

2603
02:36:55,480 --> 02:36:59,200
I was in deep in decent shape
for construction work. I figured.

2604
02:37:03,050 --> 02:37:03,883
Yeah.

2605
02:37:05,020 --> 02:37:08,080
After the Ptsd Clinic,
I returned to Kentucky.

2606
02:37:08,140 --> 02:37:13,120
It was the winter of 2010 and they warm
myself up by slipping back into hard

2607
02:37:13,121 --> 02:37:14,380
drinking each night.

2608
02:37:17,980 --> 02:37:19,990
I hadn't seen an active duty grunt months.

2609
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:24,010
Fabio and Rodriguez Chavez were due to
receive the Navy Navy crosses at the

2610
02:37:24,011 --> 02:37:25,360
Marine Corps base in Quantico,

2611
02:37:25,361 --> 02:37:28,270
but I couldn't get enough time off
to fly back east where you work in

2612
02:37:28,271 --> 02:37:32,830
construction at this point? Yeah. And
your boys are getting Navy crosses.

2613
02:37:33,130 --> 02:37:34,630
You can't get time off from work.

2614
02:37:36,760 --> 02:37:40,690
Swanson and I had been recommended for
the medal of honor. We knew that. No,

2615
02:37:40,720 --> 02:37:44,500
we knew though that the award was
usually downgraded. Upon review.

2616
02:37:45,310 --> 02:37:49,420
When I drank, which was too much,
I'd laugh at the insert absurdity.

2617
02:37:49,980 --> 02:37:52,650
I had screwed up big time.
My achievement

2618
02:37:57,100 --> 02:37:58,390
was losing my brothers.

2619
02:38:00,460 --> 02:38:04,750
The Marine Corps would come to its senses
and I'd never hear another word from

2620
02:38:04,751 --> 02:38:09,520
another devil dog. I had no idea what
was in front of me and I didn't care.

2621
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:14,800
I couldn't take a walk,

2622
02:38:16,180 --> 02:38:18,760
turn on the TV or read a
book to distract my mind.

2623
02:38:18,761 --> 02:38:22,990
The emptiness of my life was the dark
all around me with nothing to see you in

2624
02:38:22,991 --> 02:38:25,240
any direction.
Four years ago,

2625
02:38:25,241 --> 02:38:27,610
I'd left the form for an
adventure and a new beginning.

2626
02:38:27,790 --> 02:38:31,510
The chord shape meaning and I had
arrived in Afghanistan. Confident.

2627
02:38:31,511 --> 02:38:34,420
I do well in combat.
Sure enough,

2628
02:38:34,660 --> 02:38:38,800
up at Monte I had emerged
as the young gun every day,

2629
02:38:38,801 --> 02:38:42,820
brought fun danger against the
backdrop of spectacular mountains.

2630
02:38:43,420 --> 02:38:46,330
It was fun stuff.
Shooting thousands of rounds,

2631
02:38:46,390 --> 02:38:49,690
not losing many people and seeing
the damage. You inflict it.

2632
02:38:50,470 --> 02:38:54,100
There was no weapon I couldn't handle
and my team trusted me to get them out of

2633
02:38:54,101 --> 02:38:56,740
any hotspot my cockiness put us in,

2634
02:38:58,710 --> 02:39:01,620
but when it counted most,
I wasn't with them.

2635
02:39:03,790 --> 02:39:05,350
They weren't trained to do my job.

2636
02:39:05,530 --> 02:39:08,410
Gunny Johnson didn't spend
every day behind a to 40

2637
02:39:09,340 --> 02:39:09,810
yeah.

2638
02:39:09,810 --> 02:39:13,110
Staff, staff. Sergeant Kenefick wasn't
comfortable with weapons or ankles.

2639
02:39:13,111 --> 02:39:16,620
A fire doc late and wasn't a fighter and
Lieutenant Johnson didn't adjust fire

2640
02:39:16,621 --> 02:39:19,410
missions.
We aren't worried.

2641
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:22,620
We know you'll get us out
if anything goes bad. Meyer,

2642
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:29,740
well, I didn't lieutenant. That
was a load of worthless shit.

2643
02:39:30,100 --> 02:39:31,480
Not there when you needed me.

2644
02:39:33,290 --> 02:39:34,123
Yeah.

2645
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:35,550
Around three in the morning,

2646
02:39:35,850 --> 02:39:39,420
I pulled my truck into the driveway of
a shop owned by my high school friend

2647
02:39:39,421 --> 02:39:41,370
Derek Yates had cut the engine.

2648
02:39:44,780 --> 02:39:47,690
I turned on the cab light
and fished out by cell phone.

2649
02:39:49,410 --> 02:39:50,970
It wasn't right to burn my dad,

2650
02:39:51,270 --> 02:39:53,640
but I wanted to connect
one last time with someone.

2651
02:39:55,180 --> 02:39:55,780
Yeah.

2652
02:39:55,780 --> 02:39:59,170
I picked out a text message
to my friends and then Toby,

2653
02:40:00,250 --> 02:40:03,940
they had known me since I was a toddler,
but they didn't know me that well.

2654
02:40:03,941 --> 02:40:04,774
Did they?

2655
02:40:06,270 --> 02:40:06,660
Okay.

2656
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:11,010
Here I was back where I had
started with an aluminum bracelet.

2657
02:40:11,830 --> 02:40:12,140
Okay.

2658
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:14,040
With two names on each

2659
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:14,873
arrest.

2660
02:40:16,720 --> 02:40:19,960
That's what I had done with my life.
Lost Four brothers.

2661
02:40:22,210 --> 02:40:23,043
Okay.

2662
02:40:23,270 --> 02:40:28,270
I can't do it any more.

2663
02:40:32,410 --> 02:40:33,243
I typed,

2664
02:40:36,980 --> 02:40:39,770
I reached into the glove
compartment where I kept my glock.

2665
02:40:42,020 --> 02:40:44,990
I always kept a full magazine with
a round chambered in the pistol.

2666
02:40:47,670 --> 02:40:51,840
A Glock doesn't have a safety.
You pulled the trigger

2667
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:54,810
and the weapon fires.

2668
02:40:59,760 --> 02:41:03,930
I stuck the gun to my head
and squeeze the trigger.

2669
02:41:07,880 --> 02:41:11,690
Click
nothing.

2670
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:14,953
Nada.

2671
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:20,490
No round in the chamber.
As you can imagine.

2672
02:41:20,491 --> 02:41:24,570
I sat there quite sobered
up and didn't double shock

2673
02:41:27,560 --> 02:41:31,310
suicide is terminal self revulsion.

2674
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:38,920
I was mixed up but I knew my
team would be disappointed in me.

2675
02:41:40,490 --> 02:41:40,900
Okay.

2676
02:41:40,900 --> 02:41:43,510
Staff Sergeant can effect
would give me hell,

2677
02:41:43,630 --> 02:41:45,850
which is where I would be bad ending.

2678
02:41:47,790 --> 02:41:50,460
That was not going to happen.

2679
02:41:53,290 --> 02:41:54,123
Okay,

2680
02:41:54,530 --> 02:41:58,740
but who downloaded my pistol
right on the spot?

2681
02:41:59,190 --> 02:42:03,760
I knew who had done it. Have I ever
talked to that person about it?

2682
02:42:04,600 --> 02:42:05,433
No.

2683
02:42:08,480 --> 02:42:10,190
I put away the pistol and drove home

2684
02:42:12,710 --> 02:42:13,543
that night.

2685
02:42:14,420 --> 02:42:17,780
I experienced no sudden change
of direction in my life.

2686
02:42:17,900 --> 02:42:20,870
I didn't know where I was headed
in the future, but I knew,

2687
02:42:20,990 --> 02:42:23,750
I knew quitting wasn't right.

2688
02:42:26,020 --> 02:42:30,010
Not that night.
Not ever.

2689
02:42:40,090 --> 02:42:41,330
I had never told.

2690
02:42:42,040 --> 02:42:42,873
MMM.

2691
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:48,540
I never told anybody about that night
until it was published in the book.

2692
02:42:50,560 --> 02:42:51,393
And,
uh,

2693
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,940
I just,
you know,

2694
02:42:55,941 --> 02:43:00,170
I just felt like it was important to the
story because I didn't want people to

2695
02:43:00,171 --> 02:43:04,940
read the story and then just think
that it was all okay when I came home.

2696
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,130
I didn't want to give
them that perspective.

2697
02:43:07,131 --> 02:43:11,060
And there are so many guys out there
that write these books of the crazy shit

2698
02:43:11,080 --> 02:43:14,410
that they do,
but they never talk about what,

2699
02:43:16,150 --> 02:43:17,920
what that crazy shit does to them.

2700
02:43:18,210 --> 02:43:20,970
Yeah. They never talk about
that. And so what happens is, is

2701
02:43:23,580 --> 02:43:27,630
people read that and they're like,
Holy Shit, that's, that's crazy.

2702
02:43:28,830 --> 02:43:33,730
I could never do that because I deal
with problems. And it's like, yeah,

2703
02:43:33,780 --> 02:43:38,400
we all do. And you know,
I had to put it into,

2704
02:43:39,510 --> 02:43:43,600
I wanted people to know that I'm just
a human. I'm no different now. And I,

2705
02:43:43,620 --> 02:43:46,500
I felt like that I couldn't put in the,
the,

2706
02:43:47,040 --> 02:43:51,840
if you want to call it good stuff
and not put in the bad stuff,

2707
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:54,243
it's,

2708
02:43:55,190 --> 02:43:58,750
I'm sure there's some psychologists that
could figure something out about this.

2709
02:43:58,751 --> 02:44:01,690
But you got to the point,
right,

2710
02:44:02,290 --> 02:44:04,600
and you made the decision clearly.
Yeah.

2711
02:44:06,160 --> 02:44:11,160
And you came out the other side by the
grace of God and whoever knew you well

2712
02:44:11,891 --> 02:44:12,400
enough to,

2713
02:44:12,400 --> 02:44:15,940
to figure out that they needed to make
sure you didn't have a loaded gun.

2714
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:23,760
But that's a message for anybody that
feels like they're in the same situation

2715
02:44:23,801 --> 02:44:26,680
that you felt like you were in, which is
that there's not going to get any better

2716
02:44:28,590 --> 02:44:32,310
is like, okay, come out
the other side, man,

2717
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:37,350
come out the other side. And it
was like, I mean, like you said,

2718
02:44:37,351 --> 02:44:41,090
it's not a sudden change in
direction, but you, but you knew

2719
02:44:42,770 --> 02:44:46,270
hi. Uh, you couldn't quit. I
always like to say that, you know,

2720
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:51,700
sometimes you find yourself in the middle
of nowhere and sometimes in the middle

2721
02:44:51,701 --> 02:44:55,960
of nowhere you find
yourself. And, uh, you know,

2722
02:44:58,030 --> 02:45:02,590
I, uh, I mean I had no idea what my life
was going. I made a deal with myself.

2723
02:45:02,591 --> 02:45:06,440
You know, I had sat there and, uh,

2724
02:45:07,230 --> 02:45:11,860
I had said, if I'm going to keep
living this life, this way, the rack,

2725
02:45:12,220 --> 02:45:17,030
rack it back and get it over with,
but I said,

2726
02:45:17,031 --> 02:45:21,020
if I ever put the car in drive, I'll
never look back. And I sit there,

2727
02:45:21,021 --> 02:45:23,480
I'm not going to lie to you. I probably
sit there for five, 10 minutes.

2728
02:45:24,980 --> 02:45:25,940
And I had done it at,

2729
02:45:25,990 --> 02:45:29,240
at my buddy shot because I knew he'd be
there eight o'clock in the morning and

2730
02:45:29,241 --> 02:45:32,120
he could just find me. And, uh,

2731
02:45:34,730 --> 02:45:39,410
I put it in drive and I just, I never
looked back. You know, I, you know,

2732
02:45:39,411 --> 02:45:41,840
and it's, I'm lucky. I'm fortunate.

2733
02:45:43,010 --> 02:45:46,670
Did the gun didn't go off right. Um, but,

2734
02:45:48,110 --> 02:45:52,130
um, you know, I think that, you know,
you always got to hit that rock bottom,

2735
02:45:52,610 --> 02:45:57,080
you know, I think that in
that was for me, that was it.

2736
02:45:57,470 --> 02:46:01,010
That was the rock bottom.
And you know, it changed it.

2737
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:07,080
I mean, again, I just want to stress this
as much as I can because I believe me,

2738
02:46:07,081 --> 02:46:11,630
I hear from people,
especially from veterans that are,

2739
02:46:11,720 --> 02:46:14,690
that are walking this line,
man, they're walking this line.

2740
02:46:15,020 --> 02:46:19,300
And if you're walking that line,
hold it.

2741
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:23,840
Yeah. Listen, it's not
worth it. I mean, it's,

2742
02:46:23,900 --> 02:46:26,720
it's not like, you know,
I had to change, honestly,

2743
02:46:26,721 --> 02:46:29,060
I had to change the way
that I looked at life.

2744
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:35,690
The only problem there was
was me, you know, instead of
just facing it and saying,

2745
02:46:35,691 --> 02:46:36,920
Hey, look, I want to fix this problem.

2746
02:46:36,921 --> 02:46:38,630
I was blaming everybody
else for my problems.

2747
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:44,150
And what I had to do was I
had to say, you know, okay,

2748
02:46:45,320 --> 02:46:50,240
if you know,
if the things that I seen were so bad,

2749
02:46:51,410 --> 02:46:54,950
I've seen what freedom cost firsthand.

2750
02:46:55,610 --> 02:46:59,240
That's what's got me there.
So if anything,

2751
02:46:59,270 --> 02:47:03,320
I have more reason than anybody else in
the face of this planet to go out and

2752
02:47:03,321 --> 02:47:06,620
make the most of my life because I've
seen it firsthand of what it costs.

2753
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:10,400
So instead of walking around
and Phyllis, I, you know,

2754
02:47:10,420 --> 02:47:13,250
I'm not feeling sorry for my teammates
because they're in a better place,

2755
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:18,580
they don't feel anymore.
I'm really just feeling sorry for myself.

2756
02:47:18,730 --> 02:47:20,380
And then by doing that,
I'm sick.

2757
02:47:20,590 --> 02:47:25,240
I'm wasting the sacrifices that they
made on my behalf and I had to change the

2758
02:47:25,241 --> 02:47:29,350
way I looked at it.
Instead of using it as my excuse,

2759
02:47:30,160 --> 02:47:33,490
I had to use it as my fuel.
And that's a choice.

2760
02:47:34,630 --> 02:47:36,370
That is a conscious choice.

2761
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:40,810
You wake up every day and you decide
how you look at the situation.

2762
02:47:41,020 --> 02:47:42,550
You decide what you do with the,

2763
02:47:42,551 --> 02:47:46,330
you decide whether you use it as your
excuse to hold you back or you use it as

2764
02:47:46,331 --> 02:47:47,370
your easy a,
you know,

2765
02:47:47,500 --> 02:47:52,500
valve of hiding who you are or you use
it as your fuel to go out and be the best

2766
02:47:53,381 --> 02:47:58,000
that you can be. You decide that nobody
does. Nobody else does. You do every day

2767
02:47:59,560 --> 02:48:02,830
and it is a conscious choice.
I mean, I still deal with it,

2768
02:48:03,400 --> 02:48:04,900
but I still make the choice.

2769
02:48:07,890 --> 02:48:12,090
That's awesome. That's awesome.
And anybody that's listening,

2770
02:48:12,570 --> 02:48:16,230
like I said, anybody that's listening and
that's, that's walking that line. Yeah.

2771
02:48:16,260 --> 02:48:20,400
There you go. Make the right choice.
Make the right choice, make the choice,

2772
02:48:20,790 --> 02:48:25,410
make the right choice. And you
know what the right choices. Yeah.

2773
02:48:25,411 --> 02:48:29,340
And I mean you're talking about
how much and, and I feel this too,

2774
02:48:29,430 --> 02:48:30,660
like every day,

2775
02:48:30,690 --> 02:48:35,690
how much am I letting down my friends
that didn't come home if I'm not doing

2776
02:48:35,971 --> 02:48:39,920
everything I can to take advantage
of the gift they gave me,

2777
02:48:39,930 --> 02:48:41,850
if to be sitting here right now.
Right.

2778
02:48:42,450 --> 02:48:47,160
I mean, I mean any day that I don't
want to go on and push on for myself,

2779
02:48:47,460 --> 02:48:51,600
I can look down and I bet you anything,
I got four reasons right here.

2780
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:53,580
They would switch me one day.

2781
02:48:54,300 --> 02:48:58,350
They would switch me my worst
day to have one more day.

2782
02:49:00,010 --> 02:49:00,843
Yeah.

2783
02:49:00,900 --> 02:49:02,720
Do you know? And, and, and I just,

2784
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:05,353
yeah.

2785
02:49:05,430 --> 02:49:09,330
You know, I'm not okay with letting
their sacrifice. It'd be wasted.

2786
02:49:09,570 --> 02:49:11,730
I'm not okay with watching
anybody else waste them.

2787
02:49:11,820 --> 02:49:14,850
So why would I be okay with
letting myself waste them?

2788
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:23,063
Well,

2789
02:49:28,250 --> 02:49:30,680
and other thing I want to say,
he is like walking that line.

2790
02:49:31,370 --> 02:49:35,300
I want to say this and get it out
there. It's normal. It's normal.

2791
02:49:35,301 --> 02:49:39,350
It doesn't mean you're weak. It doesn't.
I want to get that, that stigma out there.

2792
02:49:39,700 --> 02:49:43,880
Uh, you know, I want to get that off
the books is, it's, it is a normal,

2793
02:49:44,060 --> 02:49:46,370
like I don't understand why,

2794
02:49:46,850 --> 02:49:51,590
why it's okay in our society or in
the military. A guy breaks his leg.

2795
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:58,430
Okay, do you go make
him Ryan Tomorrow? Yeah.

2796
02:49:58,700 --> 02:50:02,180
He puts a cast on it.
He, he, he rehabs it.

2797
02:50:03,950 --> 02:50:08,450
It's the same thing with the mind. It's
the same thing. It's the same thing.

2798
02:50:08,780 --> 02:50:10,830
You go in and you watch it.

2799
02:50:11,090 --> 02:50:15,590
The people you have to worry about
are the ones that go watch their close

2800
02:50:15,591 --> 02:50:20,360
friends and they watch human beings and
they watch this evil and people die and

2801
02:50:20,361 --> 02:50:23,450
suffer and don't have a reaction.

2802
02:50:23,660 --> 02:50:26,270
Those are the ones you
have to worry about.

2803
02:50:28,130 --> 02:50:31,700
It is a normal reaction
to a not normal situation.

2804
02:50:32,300 --> 02:50:36,920
And it's okay. It's okay. It is 110%.

2805
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:38,113
Okay.

2806
02:50:39,900 --> 02:50:40,170
Okay.

2807
02:50:40,170 --> 02:50:42,540
Absolutely man.
Absolutely.

2808
02:50:46,610 --> 02:50:50,150
As you, we mentioned quickly, you know,

2809
02:50:50,151 --> 02:50:54,870
there was some buzz possibly about,
about you getting a medal of honor. Yeah.

2810
02:50:55,600 --> 02:51:00,080
And, but you know how it goes. Like it
was all, I didn't believe it. I never,

2811
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:03,290
I never had any idea. Uh, you know,

2812
02:51:03,950 --> 02:51:07,820
you hear talk about it at
Silver Star, medal of honor,
navy, cross, whatever. Right.

2813
02:51:11,210 --> 02:51:13,220
I didn't care. I didn't, I,

2814
02:51:14,690 --> 02:51:18,170
I promised the last thing that I
ever thought about. What's an award?

2815
02:51:20,060 --> 02:51:21,880
An award.
That's the last thing.

2816
02:51:24,060 --> 02:51:24,893
Yeah.

2817
02:51:25,380 --> 02:51:26,970
Well,
it gets approved.

2818
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:33,790
And going back to the book, when the
president hung that medal around my neck,

2819
02:51:35,020 --> 02:51:39,010
I felt glum.
I couldn't smile and I said nothing.

2820
02:51:40,810 --> 02:51:44,800
I gave no remarks and avoided the press.
As a marine,

2821
02:51:44,950 --> 02:51:49,480
you either bring your team
home alive or you die. Trying,

2822
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:57,020
my country was recognizing me for being
a failure and for the worst day of my

2823
02:51:57,691 --> 02:52:01,130
life,
the marine commandant,

2824
02:52:01,340 --> 02:52:06,340
General Jim Amos at General Joe
Joseph attended the ceremony.

2825
02:52:06,670 --> 02:52:08,630
Throughout the years after gone to golf,

2826
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:12,910
the Marine Corps leadership has provided
con consistent support, not just to me,

2827
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:18,060
but to all who fought there.
The top enlisted man in the Marine Corps,

2828
02:52:18,270 --> 02:52:23,100
Sergeant Major Mike Barrett twice came
to our farm to meet my dad and Granddad

2829
02:52:23,101 --> 02:52:24,120
and to encourage me.

2830
02:52:26,880 --> 02:52:29,430
There is no such thing as a former marine.

2831
02:52:30,280 --> 02:52:30,760
Yeah.

2832
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:32,860
50 years after they have left active duty.

2833
02:52:33,010 --> 02:52:37,030
Marines still sign emails to each
other with SF, semper Fidelis,

2834
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:38,050
always faithful.

2835
02:52:40,030 --> 02:52:44,020
Of course we have among us
those who failed themselves,
their family and society.

2836
02:52:44,320 --> 02:52:48,550
The fact remains though that the core
expects every marine to live by a set of

2837
02:52:48,551 --> 02:52:52,330
core values. In turn, the core
keeps its side of the bargain.

2838
02:52:53,300 --> 02:52:53,950
Yeah.

2839
02:52:53,950 --> 02:52:57,490
You can not ask anything more
of an organization than that.

2840
02:52:57,730 --> 02:53:01,810
The metal of honor given in the name
of the Congress of the United States of

2841
02:53:01,810 --> 02:53:05,350
America, symbolizes the courage and
determination of our entire country

2842
02:53:10,390 --> 02:53:11,223
and

2843
02:53:11,910 --> 02:53:14,030
speaking of the country you were in

2844
02:53:17,480 --> 02:53:20,270
New York?
I was in New York City.

2845
02:53:21,770 --> 02:53:22,410
Yeah,

2846
02:53:22,410 --> 02:53:26,760
at the twin tower site.
Ground Zero with gunny Joshua Peterson.

2847
02:53:26,940 --> 02:53:29,100
Someone I knew from my
first days in the core,

2848
02:53:30,330 --> 02:53:34,470
we were greeted by hundreds of
police, firemen, construction workers,

2849
02:53:34,650 --> 02:53:38,910
Wall Street guys and suits, city
officials, and the families of the fallen

2850
02:53:41,270 --> 02:53:43,910
Meyer. I can't believe this
scene, gunny. Peterson said,

2851
02:53:45,200 --> 02:53:46,940
make sure your ribbons are squared away.

2852
02:53:50,350 --> 02:53:51,640
We stood side by side.

2853
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:52,800
Yeah,

2854
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:57,130
two grants and sharply iron Khakis
waving like we had won an election.

2855
02:53:58,990 --> 02:54:02,890
I thought of my sad fumbling meetings
with the family of team Monte,

2856
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:07,060
the families of team Monte when
I couldn't think of much to say.

2857
02:54:09,990 --> 02:54:12,060
I was alive and their loved ones were not.

2858
02:54:13,450 --> 02:54:13,840
Yeah.

2859
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:17,950
Now here I was standing before
a monument for 3000 dead.

2860
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:20,360
Yeah.

2861
02:54:20,360 --> 02:54:24,530
I saw some big iron workers in
hardhats standing off to one side.

2862
02:54:26,330 --> 02:54:30,800
When the ceremony ended,
they sneaked me in onto a work elevator

2863
02:54:32,590 --> 02:54:36,940
up. We went to the top of the ride where
we then climbed wooden ladders until we

2864
02:54:36,941 --> 02:54:38,020
couldn't go any further.

2865
02:54:38,930 --> 02:54:39,360
Okay.

2866
02:54:39,360 --> 02:54:40,710
Then the [inaudible] guard rails.

2867
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:45,850
I stood there looking out at the
most beautiful country in the world,

2868
02:54:45,851 --> 02:54:47,590
trying to make sense of my feelings.

2869
02:54:49,910 --> 02:54:51,260
This was where it all started.

2870
02:54:51,470 --> 02:54:55,580
So many good people lost the people who
had been working here and the people I

2871
02:54:55,581 --> 02:55:00,220
had known who had not gone blindly
into uniform, they had reasoned why

2872
02:55:02,410 --> 02:55:03,470
Americans do that.

2873
02:55:05,810 --> 02:55:09,440
But they had gone ahead to do and to die.

2874
02:55:13,280 --> 02:55:17,540
An iron worker handed me a silver marker.

2875
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:21,750
Then I wrote on a girder.

2876
02:55:23,440 --> 02:55:24,273
Yeah.

2877
02:55:24,970 --> 02:55:27,100
For those who gave

2878
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:30,353
all

2879
02:55:44,060 --> 02:55:45,800
for those who gave all,

2880
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:55,320
and that wraps up the book,
Em,

2881
02:55:59,110 --> 02:55:59,670
you know,

2882
02:55:59,670 --> 02:56:04,670
you're talking about the awards and what
you hear and what happens and all that.

2883
02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:09,920
And I wanted to say this as well,
on the battlefield,

2884
02:56:10,640 --> 02:56:13,400
on that battlefield,
and on every battle,

2885
02:56:13,940 --> 02:56:18,800
there are acts of extreme valor
that no one will ever know about.

2886
02:56:19,680 --> 02:56:22,070
I'm talking about an infinite number,

2887
02:56:26,440 --> 02:56:27,170
okay.

2888
02:56:27,170 --> 02:56:28,670
No one's ever going to know about them.

2889
02:56:31,960 --> 02:56:33,190
And it's important to know this,

2890
02:56:33,191 --> 02:56:37,720
that our military men and women don't
do what they do for metals or ribbons.

2891
02:56:37,900 --> 02:56:42,130
They do what they do because they love
freedom because they love America because

2892
02:56:42,131 --> 02:56:44,080
they loved their comrades in arms,

2893
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:48,430
and that right there is why
our country thrives in battle,

2894
02:56:54,150 --> 02:56:56,970
not because of technological advances,

2895
02:56:56,971 --> 02:57:01,470
not because of superior weapon tree,
not even the size of our military.

2896
02:57:02,340 --> 02:57:06,840
It's because of the bond that is shared
between warriors that is our real

2897
02:57:06,841 --> 02:57:07,674
strength

2898
02:57:13,650 --> 02:57:15,870
and Dakota, that something
that you represent in space.

2899
02:57:22,070 --> 02:57:24,440
They don't. I want to thank
you for coming on the podcast

2900
02:57:26,470 --> 02:57:29,420
and sharing this incredible story and an,

2901
02:57:29,620 --> 02:57:33,310
I know it's not only a story of you,
but it's a story of all the men,

2902
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:35,890
American and Afghan as well,

2903
02:57:35,950 --> 02:57:40,570
that rode into battle with you that day
and showed a once again what it is that

2904
02:57:40,571 --> 02:57:42,640
makes America a place of,

2905
02:57:44,320 --> 02:57:48,950
of hope and a freedom.
It's because of,

2906
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,040
it's because of man.

2907
02:57:54,041 --> 02:57:58,820
It's because of individual men that
in their heart and even in the face of

2908
02:57:59,000 --> 02:57:59,833
death,

2909
02:58:02,740 --> 02:58:07,740
actually live actually live the
ideals of this great nation.

2910
02:58:12,600 --> 02:58:16,170
Not only in their words,
but in their actions,

2911
02:58:16,200 --> 02:58:18,720
in the way that they live and in the way

2912
02:58:21,760 --> 02:58:22,600
that they died.

2913
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:28,210
God bless.
All right.

2914
02:58:31,560 --> 02:58:32,393
They're incredible.

2915
02:58:34,980 --> 02:58:38,580
You know, I, I mean, you're
exactly right. Like, I mean,

2916
02:58:38,581 --> 02:58:41,670
there's so many stories that
are, I mean, people have done

2917
02:58:44,580 --> 02:58:49,580
so many stories of people doing
such incredible stuff and you know,

2918
02:58:50,470 --> 02:58:54,450
it's, it's, it's literally out of
the love of another human being.

2919
02:58:56,070 --> 02:59:00,600
It's literally, I the love of making
the world a better place. That's really,

2920
02:59:02,220 --> 02:59:06,230
that's really all we do. It's
all we do. I mean, we join,

2921
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:11,790
nobody joins it. Okay. To go
with just shoot people or fight.

2922
02:59:13,050 --> 02:59:14,280
They literally joined to,

2923
02:59:14,940 --> 02:59:18,420
to try to make the world
around them a better place.

2924
02:59:19,230 --> 02:59:20,490
Whether it's passing out a,

2925
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:25,140
whether it's rendering aid
to a civilian or to, uh,

2926
02:59:26,820 --> 02:59:27,680
uh, you know, I,

2927
02:59:27,690 --> 02:59:32,690
fellow American or whether it's taken
out the bully that's inflicting fear in

2928
02:59:34,561 --> 02:59:37,950
that place.
Every thing that we do

2929
02:59:39,780 --> 02:59:43,140
is to try to make the world
just a little bit better.

2930
02:59:45,020 --> 02:59:45,853
That's it.

2931
02:59:47,230 --> 02:59:51,120
Yeah. As I was reading about when,
when you got back to your team,

2932
02:59:52,440 --> 02:59:56,160
you could see, I mean just from
the way the guys were laid out,

2933
02:59:57,030 --> 02:59:57,863
you know,

2934
02:59:58,170 --> 03:00:01,980
staff sergeant was trying to get comms
and trying to pass grids and doc was

2935
03:00:01,981 --> 03:00:03,990
working on the boss.

2936
03:00:04,950 --> 03:00:08,250
I mean everyone was trying to make
things happen and who knows what those

2937
03:00:08,251 --> 03:00:10,950
moments were like, you know,
but there's moments of there's,

2938
03:00:10,951 --> 03:00:13,590
there's heroism there that
we're never going to know about.

2939
03:00:14,640 --> 03:00:18,990
No, I mean, I mean 100%. I mean
doc late and was rendering aid,

2940
03:00:18,991 --> 03:00:21,960
you know what stopped him was
cause pause l was with them.

2941
03:00:23,490 --> 03:00:28,490
What stopped him of getting to the
road was Lieutenant Johnson got hit

2942
03:00:30,870 --> 03:00:34,800
and a gunny Kenefick in gunny
Johnson were on either side,

2943
03:00:34,801 --> 03:00:37,500
provide security while doc
late and worked on him.

2944
03:00:37,980 --> 03:00:40,170
And that was the med evac we
heard called in from gunny.

2945
03:00:40,171 --> 03:00:44,500
Kenefick was trying to call that medivac
in for Lieutenant Johnson right here.

2946
03:00:45,270 --> 03:00:46,120
And um,

2947
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:49,373
you know,

2948
03:00:50,130 --> 03:00:52,800
but they weren't going to,
they weren't going to leave him behind

2949
03:00:54,720 --> 03:00:57,470
even more,
even more of not leaving them behind.

2950
03:00:58,500 --> 03:01:00,010
They weren't going to
just throw him over his

2951
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:03,250
shoulder and get him out.
They were going to try to fix him.

2952
03:01:07,790 --> 03:01:11,930
I mean, what'd he say?
What'd he say? I mean,

2953
03:01:11,931 --> 03:01:16,370
you know that right there. I mean that
right there is everything. I mean,

2954
03:01:16,371 --> 03:01:20,330
you take that, you take, I mean,
there's so many actions. I mean,

2955
03:01:20,331 --> 03:01:22,790
I've watched people do
such incredible things,

2956
03:01:24,200 --> 03:01:29,000
such incredible things that just
make what I do. I mean, Nah,

2957
03:01:29,001 --> 03:01:33,660
you know, Nah, makes me look like a,
you know, I've done nothing. I've,

2958
03:01:33,700 --> 03:01:35,750
I've seen it, you know,
people are incredible.

2959
03:01:38,730 --> 03:01:41,850
Well, I'm again, man.

2960
03:01:42,240 --> 03:01:43,800
I can't thank you enough for coming on.

2961
03:01:44,190 --> 03:01:49,190
No thank you on the
podcast and hanging out and

2962
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:55,110
being out there and kicking ass and
talking smack to people. I like that too.

2963
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:02,450
Uh, did I miss anything?
Anything else? No.

2964
03:02:04,380 --> 03:02:08,860
Thank you. Thank you.
Covered it all. I uh,

2965
03:02:09,460 --> 03:02:12,020
I think you covered it, you know, Echo,

2966
03:02:13,130 --> 03:02:16,830
you got any questions for
the man over there? Nah,

2967
03:02:16,831 --> 03:02:20,070
usually I come up with some
lighthearted question, but man,

2968
03:02:20,910 --> 03:02:25,880
I'm out of words, to be honest with
you. We took that little, a break.

2969
03:02:26,660 --> 03:02:30,760
An Echo was like, man, he's that
guy. Just keep the SEC. I, I,

2970
03:02:30,900 --> 03:02:34,190
I'm sitting there thinking to myself, this
really happened man. And I'm like, yeah,

2971
03:02:34,440 --> 03:02:38,670
I told, I gave, I gave echo heads up
sometimes, you know, I say, hey man,

2972
03:02:38,850 --> 03:02:43,070
it's going to be heavy one or whatever.
And I was like, told him this afternoon,

2973
03:02:43,080 --> 03:02:47,660
I'm like, Amen. It's going to be heavy
one, you know, stand by. And you know,

2974
03:02:47,700 --> 03:02:50,370
we're downstairs when we were taking
that break and he's like, man,

2975
03:02:52,350 --> 03:02:54,570
all this really happened. I said,
yeah, and you know who it happened to?

2976
03:02:54,571 --> 03:02:58,080
The guy we're sitting in a room with when
his friends, like that's what happened.

2977
03:02:58,860 --> 03:03:02,610
So, uh, no, I it, early on
when I started this podcast,

2978
03:03:03,240 --> 03:03:06,000
I'd be reading a book from
Knight, from World War One. Yeah.

2979
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:10,180
Or I'd be reading the book from World
War II or Vietnam or whatever, and I'd,

2980
03:03:10,190 --> 03:03:12,420
I'd like after bite,
I don't know how many podcasts,

2981
03:03:12,421 --> 03:03:14,100
but like seven or eight
podcasts, I was like, Hey,

2982
03:03:14,101 --> 03:03:19,101
I just want to stop for a second and
remind everybody that the characters that

2983
03:03:21,331 --> 03:03:23,550
I'm talking about in these books,
these characters,

2984
03:03:23,610 --> 03:03:27,420
they're not characters in a movie.
They're, they're people, they're humans.

2985
03:03:28,560 --> 03:03:33,150
And this stuff that we're talking
about really happened to these people.

2986
03:03:34,140 --> 03:03:38,010
So again,
it's obviously avenue sitting here.

2987
03:03:38,011 --> 03:03:39,240
And I was talking to you about when,

2988
03:03:39,270 --> 03:03:43,980
when Colonel William Reader was
in here and you know, you're like,

2989
03:03:44,190 --> 03:03:46,350
you're reading stuff that happened to him.
He was tortured,

2990
03:03:46,351 --> 03:03:49,650
he was mock executions. He had, he had,

2991
03:03:51,240 --> 03:03:52,850
he was locked in a Bam,

2992
03:03:52,910 --> 03:03:57,910
a two foot tall bamboo cage in the
jungles and Vietnam and got his legs

2993
03:03:58,370 --> 03:03:59,810
in shackles and the,

2994
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:03,770
he's trying to sleep and he's getting
woken up by the rats that are eating the

2995
03:04:03,771 --> 03:04:04,820
wounds in his leg.

2996
03:04:06,230 --> 03:04:10,940
And it's like, that's
just inconceivable. Yeah.

2997
03:04:11,580 --> 03:04:15,840
I mean, edit happened.
Yeah. I mean that's,

2998
03:04:16,470 --> 03:04:21,120
you know, I hear stories like that and
just, you know, that's real people.

2999
03:04:21,870 --> 03:04:25,440
Yeah.
These are real people dislike us.

3000
03:04:27,340 --> 03:04:32,230
Yeah. In, in, in, in honestly, man. I
mean, I'm sure you saw me like sometimes,

3001
03:04:32,920 --> 03:04:35,860
you know, um, yeah, I'm getting, I
get emotional when I read your story,

3002
03:04:35,890 --> 03:04:37,900
but why do I get raw emotional
when I read your stories?

3003
03:04:37,901 --> 03:04:40,060
Cause I'm thinking of everything I've
been through. I'm thinking of my,

3004
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:41,890
my friends and I'm just like,
it's

3005
03:04:44,300 --> 03:04:46,100
man, you know, it's a,

3006
03:04:46,890 --> 03:04:47,723
okay,

3007
03:04:48,730 --> 03:04:53,140
it's real. And, and for those of you
people that are listening to this,

3008
03:04:53,141 --> 03:04:55,390
and I talked to,
I dressed like the veterans out there

3009
03:04:56,630 --> 03:05:01,010
a bunch today. Um, but you
know, to those of you that

3010
03:05:02,100 --> 03:05:05,340
didn't have the opportunity to
serve for whatever reason, you know,

3011
03:05:06,240 --> 03:05:10,020
if I could relate something to you,
it's like, yeah, these, these people,

3012
03:05:11,550 --> 03:05:14,370
these lieutenants, these
sergeants, these staff sergeants,

3013
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:19,970
man, there are people, man. There
are people. Yeah. They're just,

3014
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:24,180
they're just people. They're
just people. I mean, that's,

3015
03:05:25,790 --> 03:05:28,370
they're just people.
They're just,

3016
03:05:29,150 --> 03:05:32,160
uh, you know, and I think that that's
kind of what makes it hard for society of,

3017
03:05:33,260 --> 03:05:33,740
yeah.

3018
03:05:33,740 --> 03:05:34,011
Is it,

3019
03:05:34,011 --> 03:05:39,011
they see so many of these movies and
they read these books and you know,

3020
03:05:39,650 --> 03:05:43,820
they read it, but what they don't
understand is that somebody lived it,

3021
03:05:46,720 --> 03:05:47,351
you know?

3022
03:05:47,351 --> 03:05:51,160
And I think that that's a perspective
that you always have to remind yourself of

3023
03:05:51,161 --> 03:05:54,800
is that yeah, you're reading
it and, but somebody lived at,

3024
03:05:56,680 --> 03:06:01,660
do, you know? Yeah. Then you kind of see,

3025
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:03,933
you know,

3026
03:06:04,160 --> 03:06:08,450
on the news like, Oh yeah. Then the
medal of honor ceremony and the pictures,

3027
03:06:08,451 --> 03:06:11,150
you know,
of you getting there and you know,

3028
03:06:11,151 --> 03:06:14,090
you see the president putting it on
and it's like, wow, that's so great.

3029
03:06:14,091 --> 03:06:17,390
Or whatever in you,
what you don't,

3030
03:06:17,960 --> 03:06:21,840
what we don't see, you know,
people who haven't served, oh,

3031
03:06:22,250 --> 03:06:27,250
is like what really happened to talk
to arrive at that one quote unquote

3032
03:06:28,161 --> 03:06:31,070
glorious moment where you get
the metal. Oh my gosh, thank you.

3033
03:06:31,071 --> 03:06:35,480
Let's go party or so, I don't
know. Something, you know,
it's like, Dang, Bro did.

3034
03:06:36,190 --> 03:06:38,990
Yeah. People think it's just
so great, you know? And, uh,

3035
03:06:40,670 --> 03:06:41,240
okay.

3036
03:06:41,240 --> 03:06:46,210
I despise everything that metal
stands for for me. You know, me,

3037
03:06:46,220 --> 03:06:49,550
not anybody else,
but I,

3038
03:06:51,660 --> 03:06:53,880
you know,
when I put that medal around my neck,

3039
03:06:55,210 --> 03:06:55,940
okay.

3040
03:06:55,940 --> 03:07:00,370
To me, it's literally here's the
stamp to show the world how bad I

3041
03:07:00,490 --> 03:07:04,000
failed.
Here's the,

3042
03:07:05,200 --> 03:07:09,430
you know, um, that's why
I don't, I don't wear it.

3043
03:07:10,300 --> 03:07:15,250
I don't, I don't wear it because, you
know, it's the worst day of my life.

3044
03:07:16,480 --> 03:07:17,320
And,
uh,

3045
03:07:17,820 --> 03:07:20,610
I lost everything that day.
I lost not just my team.

3046
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:26,020
I lost my career in the Marine Corps.
I mean, everything that I wanted to be

3047
03:07:27,810 --> 03:07:31,940
was gone within one day and,
you know,

3048
03:07:31,941 --> 03:07:35,120
and then I get recognized for it,
you know?

3049
03:07:35,121 --> 03:07:37,340
So not only do you have to live with it,

3050
03:07:38,720 --> 03:07:41,780
but now you have to live with
it in the face as a nation.

3051
03:07:46,130 --> 03:07:46,963
Well,

3052
03:07:47,680 --> 03:07:52,090
from that perspective, from, from
my perspective, looking at that.

3053
03:07:53,800 --> 03:07:54,380
Okay.

3054
03:07:54,380 --> 03:07:56,990
For one thing,
the metal,

3055
03:07:57,800 --> 03:07:58,190
okay.

3056
03:07:58,190 --> 03:07:59,750
Yeah.
I mean it was put around your neck,

3057
03:07:59,751 --> 03:08:04,751
but I believe that metal represents
everyone that was with your team and you

3058
03:08:06,051 --> 03:08:09,680
might have gotten the, the, the
metal put around your neck, but it's,

3059
03:08:09,980 --> 03:08:14,980
it represents that story's going to be
told over and over again in your name.

3060
03:08:15,531 --> 03:08:18,170
Might be at the top of the list, but
every name is going to be on that list.

3061
03:08:18,171 --> 03:08:22,610
Everyone's going to know, and I mean,

3062
03:08:22,640 --> 03:08:26,450
obviously I can't imagine the burden
that comes with that metal that you live

3063
03:08:26,451 --> 03:08:29,150
with,
but at the same time

3064
03:08:30,970 --> 03:08:35,530
being able to have that you
have your brothers remembered.

3065
03:08:37,180 --> 03:08:39,100
I think that it makes it worthwhile

3066
03:08:39,440 --> 03:08:42,380
and, and you know, in that, and that's
the piece of it. You're right. I mean,

3067
03:08:42,381 --> 03:08:44,140
so on the selfish, you know, when I,

3068
03:08:44,141 --> 03:08:48,710
what I just said was on the selfish side
of it, right? That, that, that is for me,

3069
03:08:49,400 --> 03:08:53,630
um, that that is the only reason I
did it except a metal was because

3070
03:08:54,680 --> 03:08:57,200
I want my teammates to live on forever.

3071
03:08:57,950 --> 03:09:01,700
I want people to know who they were
because the day that I stopped speaking,

3072
03:09:01,701 --> 03:09:04,040
their name is the day they truly die.

3073
03:09:05,450 --> 03:09:09,110
And I have an obligation that
as long as I can still breathe,

3074
03:09:10,370 --> 03:09:13,940
that their names are still
need to be told. And um,

3075
03:09:14,630 --> 03:09:18,800
so that's what that metal allows me to
do and it is our metal. I mean it's,

3076
03:09:18,801 --> 03:09:23,480
it's for them. Um, but yeah, I mean,

3077
03:09:25,310 --> 03:09:26,720
you know,
you don't,

3078
03:09:26,920 --> 03:09:30,150
it's just, it goes against, you know,
and I think the one thing you know,

3079
03:09:30,151 --> 03:09:35,151
that is so hard for us to wrap around
is how many times in your training

3080
03:09:37,050 --> 03:09:38,540
did you,
how many times did you say it?

3081
03:09:38,550 --> 03:09:40,500
Like when you were training
guys and this and that,

3082
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:44,280
how many times did you ever set them up
for when they did everything that they

3083
03:09:44,281 --> 03:09:46,800
could,
they failed

3084
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:53,950
eight to be honest with you, when I was
running training I that all the time.

3085
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:57,160
Yeah. I'm not kidding. I mean you can talk
to anybody that went through training.

3086
03:09:57,161 --> 03:10:01,810
When I ran it. It was, it was just
mayhem and it was, you were going to,

3087
03:10:01,990 --> 03:10:05,710
you know, you are going to carry out
bodies. You had 16 guys in the platoon,

3088
03:10:05,711 --> 03:10:10,030
you are going to be carried six bodies
out and you're going to be carrying him

3089
03:10:10,031 --> 03:10:12,490
for four kilometers to
a helicopter extract,

3090
03:10:12,491 --> 03:10:14,950
which wasn't going to show up and you're
going to have to go on another six.

3091
03:10:14,951 --> 03:10:17,830
It W it was brutal and there was times,

3092
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:20,350
there was times where I'd kill
every single, you know, training.

3093
03:10:20,410 --> 03:10:23,500
I'd kill every single seal because they
were not doing what they're supposed to

3094
03:10:23,501 --> 03:10:25,720
do, where they were making mistakes
or the leadership wasn't stepping up.

3095
03:10:26,410 --> 03:10:29,500
I did that all the time.
I did it all the time.

3096
03:10:31,360 --> 03:10:32,170
I mean,
I can't,

3097
03:10:32,170 --> 03:10:37,170
I came back from Ramadi were when my guys
were in some really bad situations and

3098
03:10:39,070 --> 03:10:43,030
I wanted everyone to be ready
for that man. And like that was,

3099
03:10:43,810 --> 03:10:47,880
it was, I mean, I was not, I mean I,

3100
03:10:48,280 --> 03:10:51,400
I came back from Pullman and got put
in charge of training. It was awesome.

3101
03:10:51,430 --> 03:10:54,670
It was the best thing that I ever
could have done for me. And, and I,

3102
03:10:54,671 --> 03:10:57,850
I've thought it was the best thing I
could do for my teammates was to be like,

3103
03:10:57,851 --> 03:11:01,450
okay, we're going to make this
training hard, really hard. And,

3104
03:11:01,540 --> 03:11:03,520
and so probably not.

3105
03:11:03,521 --> 03:11:06,010
You probably thought I was gonna say
never book man when I was running training

3106
03:11:06,710 --> 03:11:09,400
and then that's, that's awesome.
And I had gotten, I mean,

3107
03:11:09,401 --> 03:11:14,290
I had many guys that came back from Iraq
and Afghanistan and, and would say like,

3108
03:11:14,380 --> 03:11:15,730
yeah,
Amen.

3109
03:11:17,010 --> 03:11:17,843
We got,

3110
03:11:18,720 --> 03:11:22,320
we got hammered hard in this
situation and we were ready.

3111
03:11:23,220 --> 03:11:28,080
Nothing is bad as your situation,
but yeah, but the mentality of it is,

3112
03:11:28,710 --> 03:11:31,200
you know, there are some
situations you're not going to win.

3113
03:11:32,670 --> 03:11:36,450
There are some situations where you
show up and you're not going to win.

3114
03:11:38,130 --> 03:11:41,610
And that's against everything that we
believe in. Everything that we're taught.

3115
03:11:42,810 --> 03:11:43,810
You know what I mean?
That,

3116
03:11:44,250 --> 03:11:48,810
that if we do our job and we
do it right and you still lose,

3117
03:11:51,150 --> 03:11:54,000
it doesn't make sense.
Well let's,

3118
03:11:54,030 --> 03:11:57,700
that's something I've told
many guises meant you,

3119
03:11:57,820 --> 03:12:01,620
you can do everything right.
You can make no mistakes,

3120
03:12:01,900 --> 03:12:05,130
then you can still get killed. You
could still lose. You can still thinks,

3121
03:12:05,400 --> 03:12:08,490
you know, there's decisions that you make
on the battlefield. You say if you say,

3122
03:12:08,491 --> 03:12:09,420
okay,
go left,

3123
03:12:09,840 --> 03:12:12,530
you can go left and everyone can be
great and it's the best decision ever.

3124
03:12:12,530 --> 03:12:14,760
And you could say go left and everyone
could die and it's the worst decision

3125
03:12:14,761 --> 03:12:17,970
ever. There's, there's things that
you can control inside of combat.

3126
03:12:18,060 --> 03:12:20,930
So you prepare and train
as hard as you can and,

3127
03:12:21,110 --> 03:12:23,730
and the other thing you do is you
get the leadership in the situ,

3128
03:12:23,790 --> 03:12:27,210
in a mentality that they're
not going to put themselves.

3129
03:12:27,211 --> 03:12:30,750
This is like if my guys planned something
that was stupid, I let a Mexican,

3130
03:12:30,751 --> 03:12:33,390
this is in training.
They came up with a dumb plan.

3131
03:12:33,960 --> 03:12:35,310
They were going to execute that plan.

3132
03:12:35,400 --> 03:12:37,530
I wasn't going to stop them and
they were going to get slaughtered.

3133
03:12:37,890 --> 03:12:40,650
So they'd learned some lessons.
But Oh,

3134
03:12:40,651 --> 03:12:44,870
that's why that training is so important
and it's important in everything now.

3135
03:12:44,920 --> 03:12:48,720
A hundred percent a hundred percent
I appreciate you having me on.

3136
03:12:49,860 --> 03:12:51,980
Yeah, man. Thanks for coming
brother. No, thanks so

3137
03:12:51,980 --> 03:12:55,370
much, man. It's awesome man. Yeah, right.

3138
03:12:56,060 --> 03:13:00,620
I do not accept that from you.
If you are the man. All right.

3139
03:13:00,650 --> 03:13:04,700
Echo. Yes. Talk about
something good. Sure.

3140
03:13:04,730 --> 03:13:09,350
Chill cruise. Little bit.
Good. What do you mean? Okay,

3141
03:13:09,410 --> 03:13:12,480
so we'll shift gears.
Kind of a rough transition.

3142
03:13:12,481 --> 03:13:15,640
I'll let him know that we're like three
hours plus right now so you can tell it

3143
03:13:15,650 --> 03:13:17,750
quickly if you want.
If I want,

3144
03:13:17,900 --> 03:13:22,700
please see how they kind of recommend
that. I feel like me and Dakota,

3145
03:13:22,860 --> 03:13:24,320
we have some catching up to do.

3146
03:13:24,321 --> 03:13:27,770
You guys have been talking so you know
I might drag this out a little bit. No.

3147
03:13:27,890 --> 03:13:32,810
Okay. So origin mean, this is
where you get Jocko supplements.

3148
03:13:32,811 --> 03:13:36,440
Krill oil joint warfare's for your
joints. It's free joints. Yes.

3149

3150
03:13:41,270 --> 03:13:43,070

the cognitive and physical
enhancement supplement.

3152
03:13:47,750 --> 03:13:50,540
Preworkout pre mission. It's what
it's called. It's a good one.

3153
03:13:51,530 --> 03:13:54,950
Also at origin may its origin,
main.com Maine. The state,

3154
03:13:55,340 --> 03:13:59,700
not like the main one.
Yeah. That's good. Um,

3155
03:14:00,890 --> 03:14:04,400
you got geese on there for Jujitsu.
You trained, you jittery? I do. Yeah.

3156
03:14:04,820 --> 03:14:08,690
So if you get the origin g,
those are all made in America.

3157
03:14:08,691 --> 03:14:09,570
Everything in orange is the,

3158
03:14:09,820 --> 03:14:12,910
we'll get you an origin
Giesen and American.

3159
03:14:12,950 --> 03:14:15,620
You got to represent some of them.

3160
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:22,050
Yup. From threats from the cotton. By
the way. We grow the cotton in America,

3161
03:14:22,140 --> 03:14:22,511
not the guy.

3162
03:14:22,511 --> 03:14:26,580
And they import the fabric and we
assemble them in everything from seat.

3163
03:14:26,610 --> 03:14:31,530
What is it? From seeds to seat from
dirt to shirt. The shirt or tee shirt.

3164
03:14:32,270 --> 03:14:35,310
The shirt. I'm pretty good, right?
Yeah, it was good. I liked it.

3165
03:14:35,830 --> 03:14:38,960
Oh they got some rash
guards on their spats. Yeah.

3166
03:14:41,120 --> 03:14:44,730
You know what spats are? No. Yeah, we
didn't really either. We had to kind of,

3167
03:14:44,850 --> 03:14:48,950
we had to research it arrived at spath.
Here's the bottom line.

3168
03:14:49,670 --> 03:14:54,000
They're spandex, their tights basically.
Compression gear. Where do you train?

3169
03:14:54,120 --> 03:14:55,110
Do you train a 10th planet?

3170
03:14:55,810 --> 03:14:59,520
Do you do to some you seen dudes down
there was playing or was always talking

3171
03:14:59,521 --> 03:15:03,150
about it in its 10th planet.
It's all about them. Bats.

3172
03:15:03,360 --> 03:15:05,220
They're all about the
spouse was worried about,

3173
03:15:05,540 --> 03:15:07,980
I was worried about using the
word spats cause I didn't,

3174
03:15:08,100 --> 03:15:09,990
I w it sounded like maybe
it was some kind of like,

3175
03:15:11,160 --> 03:15:15,450
let's just say sounded kind of girlish
like some girl, like a girl would be like,

3176
03:15:15,480 --> 03:15:19,620
oh I'm going to wear spanx. What
are those? It sounds like spanx.

3177
03:15:19,650 --> 03:15:22,950
I don't know what some girls wear.
Rice banks are real tight. Like the,

3178
03:15:23,730 --> 03:15:26,530
it's Kinda like, it's essentially
compression. Compression.

3179
03:15:26,760 --> 03:15:31,260
Like I would compress,
compress,

3180
03:15:32,370 --> 03:15:33,390
they should be illegal.

3181
03:15:33,480 --> 03:15:36,540
I figured out somebody who should be
illegal because it's like selling,

3182
03:15:36,940 --> 03:15:41,520
oh it's false.
I was on,

3183
03:15:41,580 --> 03:15:44,320
we were on like some kind of live
broadcasts and someone would,

3184
03:15:44,420 --> 03:15:46,830
spats is comes from what soldiers?

3185
03:15:46,860 --> 03:15:50,670
Cavalry soldiers in World War war,
like leggings.

3186
03:15:50,671 --> 03:15:53,640
And they were called spats and I was like,
okay, it's cool. Well let's say it now.

3187
03:15:53,750 --> 03:15:57,510
Yeah, they weren't really even leg you.
They're just, it's like this lower,

3188
03:15:57,630 --> 03:15:59,340
have that lower part that covers the boom

3189
03:15:59,860 --> 03:16:03,900
that was straight up. That is
not spats. That's something else.

3190
03:16:03,901 --> 03:16:06,180
What are those things called?
Did you have to do honor guard?

3191
03:16:06,181 --> 03:16:09,680
You had to wear those things? No, I think
they were actually called leggings. Wait,

3192
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:11,510
the,
so we're unclear.

3193
03:16:12,090 --> 03:16:17,090
I know what spats are very unclear
because in football you tape your shoe and

3194
03:16:17,581 --> 03:16:22,140
your ankle, that spat. So it
just, you know, I like it.

3195
03:16:23,760 --> 03:16:28,620
It works. It does. Right.
See those nonetheless,

3196
03:16:29,100 --> 03:16:32,850
origin has some spats, some
compression gear, rash guard,

3197
03:16:32,870 --> 03:16:36,090
and so it just all made American good
stuff. Or did you mean.com go on there,

3198
03:16:36,530 --> 03:16:39,150
check out all their stuff. You'd
be like something, get something.

3199

Got The whole set. Yeah.
He's very proud of that.

3202
03:16:51,440 --> 03:16:55,720
Whatever you see this semester feels
like a summit. You Know Primus Walter?

3203
03:16:56,460 --> 03:16:58,250
No. Oh yeah. What's that?

3204

that's where you get the kettle bells.

3207
03:17:16,821 --> 03:17:17,960
You want to get the whole set like me

3208
03:17:19,250 --> 03:17:20,270
or you know,

3209
03:17:21,330 --> 03:17:24,930
or other stuff. Like I said, if
you actually, I said this before,

3210
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:27,750
you want to vary up your workout
and make it more interesting.

3211
03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:31,440
Chocolate lakes boring workouts.
That's cool too.

3212
03:17:31,530 --> 03:17:36,240
But if you want to make more interesting,
get the Mace, get some more, uh,

3213
03:17:36,241 --> 03:17:39,990
what do you call it? Like more creative.

what Spotify with me too.

3226
03:18:21,871 --> 03:18:26,550
I'm not even sure I know what it is.
Some kind of Mbk feed thing,

3227
03:18:26,730 --> 03:18:29,480
but we're on it. Yeah. I don't want Alexa.

3228
03:18:29,481 --> 03:18:34,480
You do you have Alexa and never heard
of her? Okay, well see Amazon go,

3229
03:18:34,920 --> 03:18:39,170
oh, well you can ask it to
play Jocko podcasts. No Way.

3230
03:18:39,660 --> 03:18:41,880
I'm going to buy one just for that.
Just be like Alexa,

3231
03:18:41,881 --> 03:18:46,820
play Jocko podcast and then
it says playing the latest
episode of Jocko podcasts.

3232
03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:52,600
Yeah,
and you always see it.

3233
03:18:52,830 --> 03:18:55,500
Do you have Alexa?
That's like saying, Hey,

3234
03:18:55,501 --> 03:18:59,700
do you have or you should go buy a Siri.
You can't buy Siri.

3235
03:18:59,701 --> 03:19:01,190
Siri comes with your phone.

3236
03:19:01,310 --> 03:19:05,510
No, no, no. You can buy Alexa.
No, you cannot buy an Alexa.

3237
03:19:05,600 --> 03:19:09,530
Buy An Amazon Echo. No one calls it
that though. No one talks about that.

3238
03:19:09,531 --> 03:19:11,360
Maybe they should because
that's the correct date.

3239
03:19:11,420 --> 03:19:14,790
We don't want to confuse people know
the only one that's cute. No, no, no.

3240
03:19:14,810 --> 03:19:17,690
You do want to come to these
people talking about Alexa.

3241
03:19:17,720 --> 03:19:20,590
I know that I'm trying to edge all right.

3242
03:19:20,600 --> 03:19:23,540
If you're going to dig in on this thing,
you had to go Amazon Echo. Believe me.

3243
03:19:23,541 --> 03:19:26,380
I know. It's a tube. An intelligent too.

3244
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:29,950
They have to be all about you
and that's what it comes down.

3245
03:19:29,980 --> 03:19:34,580
[inaudible] that's what it is.

3246
03:19:35,600 --> 03:19:36,990
Look how happy Jocko

3247
03:19:39,650 --> 03:19:44,030
get that Amazon Echo.
And then you ask Alexa.

3248
03:19:44,031 --> 03:19:47,780
So essentially Alexa in the Amazon Echos
get, what? If I wanted to ask echo,

3249
03:19:47,810 --> 03:19:50,840
it won't. It won't respond. You can
call me up whenever I'll respond.

3250

Amazon Echo will not respond to the name.
Alexa lives in Amazon Echo.

3251
03:19:55,070 --> 03:19:55,903
Just like Siri

3252
03:19:56,120 --> 03:19:59,610
in your iPhone. There's nothing living
in my iPhone. It's a machine. It's,

3253
03:19:59,640 --> 03:20:03,060
it's artificial life diligence.

Youtube also Jocko is a store.
It's called Jocko store.

3259
03:20:23,410 --> 03:20:27,780
It's like, it's called Jocko podcasts.
Jocko store. Cause it's a store.

3260
03:20:27,950 --> 03:20:32,240
I like. His reading is called Jocko. Yeah.

3261
03:20:32,650 --> 03:20:36,800
If I had a bad ass name, like Jocko,
if your name is Dakota, come on man.

3262
03:20:36,890 --> 03:20:40,080
I know everybody thinks it's like a girl
though. Oh really? Is that girl's name?

3263
03:20:40,081 --> 03:20:44,420
Dakota. Dakota fanning. And I like,
I pick up the phone and they're like,

3264
03:20:44,421 --> 03:20:46,820
uh ma'am. And I'm like, uh, no.

3265
03:20:48,320 --> 03:20:52,340
I didn't even know there was a girl's
name. Dakota. Well, yeah, sorry man.

3266
03:20:52,850 --> 03:20:55,610
You like a girl named sue.
Is that why you turned out so bad as

3267
03:20:59,110 --> 03:21:01,010
that is awesome by Johnny Cash?

3268
03:21:01,610 --> 03:21:05,540
I kind of feel like when it came down to
Jocko to name his own store and stuff,

3269
03:21:05,541 --> 03:21:08,270
he was all cool.
But when Amazon names their thing echo,

3270
03:21:08,271 --> 03:21:13,070
it's like you know me a little bit.
See she messed up. I was on your team.

3271
03:21:14,300 --> 03:21:18,410
No, no. You kind of called
me out. Remember at that
moment nonetheless. Hey Man,

3272
03:21:18,620 --> 03:21:22,580
I dig it either way. Jocko, store.com
this is where he can get shirts,

3273
03:21:22,581 --> 03:21:24,830
discipline equals freedom,
good shirt. The good shirt.

3274
03:21:25,300 --> 03:21:27,800
And when I say the good shirt,
it's a shirt with jock was hit on.

3275
03:21:27,801 --> 03:21:31,490
It says good backwards. So when you look
in the mirror, he's telling you good.

3276
03:21:31,520 --> 03:21:34,570
You know, I like that. It's pretty good.
When I get one I'm going to get one. Yeah,

3277
03:21:35,050 --> 03:21:38,780
I got you. I got you. And to you
too. Nice. I got you too. Alexa

3278
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:39,613
will take care of you

3279
03:21:43,250 --> 03:21:45,740
extensively. Jewelry. Nonetheless,

3280
03:21:46,330 --> 03:21:50,660
there's some rash guards on there.
So I'm hoodies, some hats, patches.

3281
03:21:50,690 --> 03:21:54,470
I got to restock. The patches
are, we stopped everything
on there. Got The patches.

3282
03:21:54,520 --> 03:21:58,760
Yeah. Hey look, I'm trying over here. Um,

3283
03:21:59,040 --> 03:22:03,490
women now the restock automatically,
am I correct? Well, okay.

3284
03:22:03,540 --> 03:22:07,090
I'm not correct. Okay. Forget it depends
on what you mean by automatically.

3285
03:22:07,100 --> 03:22:09,430
I just mean things will
be in stock from now on.

3286
03:22:09,431 --> 03:22:12,920
That's what we'll just say
more often, bro. Just say

3287
03:22:14,660 --> 03:22:19,250
you had one job.
You know what?

3288
03:22:19,670 --> 03:22:22,880
Forget it when I say he's got two jobs,
make videos and keep the store stock.

3289
03:22:23,420 --> 03:22:27,420
How's he doing to you? Like

3290
03:22:31,100 --> 03:22:34,100
chocolate store.com. That's,
that's, that's the website anyway.

3291
03:22:34,340 --> 03:22:36,860
I'm not saying single buy something.
I'm saying, look, check it out.

3292
03:22:37,460 --> 03:22:42,430
If you want something, get something good
way to support. Also good way to sports,

3293
03:22:42,431 --> 03:22:45,620
psychological warfare,
support yourself and your campaign.

3294
03:22:45,980 --> 03:22:50,220
We call it a campaign against weakness.
It makes sense. Yeah, I like it. Yeah.

3295
03:22:50,810 --> 03:22:54,590
We liked it too. So it
was suggested to us. Um,

3296
03:22:54,770 --> 03:22:57,200
you know those days where you
kind of don't feel like it. Right.

3297
03:22:57,620 --> 03:23:02,620
And who better to ask for a little
assist on those days then Jocko,

3298
03:23:03,020 --> 03:23:07,190
right. In theory, right?
I mean I agree. So boom,

3299
03:23:07,191 --> 03:23:09,620
now we have this album with tracks,

3300
03:23:10,130 --> 03:23:15,130
chocolate tracks telling you to get how
to get past moments of weakness that may

3301
03:23:16,041 --> 03:23:18,260
come up. Waking up early,
skipping workouts, you know,

3302
03:23:18,261 --> 03:23:20,510
diet stuff on it works pretty good.

3303
03:23:20,540 --> 03:23:25,160
That's bad ass 10 for 10 results.
You'll never skip a workout for me.

3304
03:23:25,190 --> 03:23:27,140
So I made this echo is like ask me,

3305
03:23:27,440 --> 03:23:30,600
ask me a question one time
like why do you not stip it?

3306
03:23:30,610 --> 03:23:32,870
How do you not skip workouts? And I
was like, well I'll just mobile boom.

3307
03:23:32,900 --> 03:23:36,020
Yeah Tony, you don't feel like, and
he's like, dude, I need to record that.

3308
03:23:36,440 --> 03:23:40,070
And then he just asked me a bunch of
random questions and then we made a new

3309
03:23:40,430 --> 03:23:43,250
recording and we put
it on iTunes for sale.

3310
03:23:44,060 --> 03:23:49,060
It was the number one spoken
word on iTunes for I think,

3311
03:23:50,420 --> 03:23:55,420
I think until you're both 11
months finally got knocked
out of number one spoken

3312
03:23:55,971 --> 03:23:58,280
word by when I released this book,

3313
03:23:58,281 --> 03:24:03,281
discipline equals freedom field manual
on iTunes as a spoken word album.

3314
03:24:04,340 --> 03:24:09,110
So I'm just saying it's like, so Randy
effective. Yeah. And it's not him.

3315
03:24:09,111 --> 03:24:13,710
So Rah Rah. Just talk like I'm not a
killer. You don't seem like a young,

3316
03:24:13,711 --> 03:24:16,760
you don't have to know. You
don't have to tell the guys, Hey,

3317
03:24:16,761 --> 03:24:19,230
I mean obviously you've got to yell on
the battlefield and you gotta yell people

3318
03:24:19,231 --> 03:24:21,170
like you so they can hear you.
That's one thing. But yeah,

3319
03:24:21,200 --> 03:24:22,670
I mean I was used to tell guys,

3320
03:24:22,671 --> 03:24:25,430
if you have to yell at someone and
you've really screwed something up as a

3321
03:24:25,431 --> 03:24:30,380
leader, if I got to yell at you
or if I got to be like, yeah.

3322
03:24:30,950 --> 03:24:34,880
Nonetheless, it's a, yeah, very
effect. Like if you, he'll be like,

3323
03:24:36,020 --> 03:24:40,580
oh, there's this one called sugarcoated
lies. Right. And it's about like,

3324
03:24:40,581 --> 03:24:44,040
you know how like when you're at work,
you were talking about the good

3325
03:24:44,040 --> 03:24:48,090
video. Yeah. Right. So this is the same
thing, but it's like a track you can get,

3326
03:24:48,450 --> 03:24:48,961
you can get,

3327
03:24:48,961 --> 03:24:52,560
actually this is the discipline equals
freedom field manual album has good on.

3328
03:24:52,561 --> 03:24:54,390
There's a track just to
track. Boom. There you go.

3329
03:24:54,590 --> 03:24:57,990
So you can put it in your whatever you
can say. So because I had people calling,

3330
03:24:58,050 --> 03:24:59,580
you should make an alarm clock,
you should make alarm clock.

3331
03:24:59,581 --> 03:25:02,430
So when we did the album with tracks
and when you could use that thing as an

3332
03:25:02,431 --> 03:25:05,310
alarm clock. So when people ask me for a
long talking, I'm like go get the albums.

3333
03:25:05,340 --> 03:25:07,800
There's three albums now by the way.
Three albums,

3334
03:25:08,190 --> 03:25:10,800
psychological warfare and this
one was in two different albums.

3335
03:25:10,830 --> 03:25:13,350
You really only need the first album of
discipline equals freedom field manual

3336
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:17,510
frivolously for the audio. Yeah,
you can get, well there's, there's,

3337
03:25:17,640 --> 03:25:21,810
well if you want the knowledge parts,
that's the second video. The second,

3338
03:25:21,900 --> 03:25:25,050
the second album, you didn't know
I was over here. So this is where,

3339
03:25:25,051 --> 03:25:28,800
this is where echo started. Hammer Hammer
me because you know when they list you,

3340
03:25:29,160 --> 03:25:32,970
they list like psychological warfare and
then they have to list who made it and

3341
03:25:32,971 --> 03:25:37,860
it was artist Jocko Willink. No, no, no,

3342
03:25:37,861 --> 03:25:41,520
no. I'm not an artist. I just, well, I'm
just speaking. I'm just saying it works.

3343
03:25:41,521 --> 03:25:44,100
That's not art. No, it's heck no,
no, no. You're an artist. You know,

3344
03:25:44,101 --> 03:25:49,050
so he didn't know that man.
I never,

3345
03:25:49,051 --> 03:25:52,110
I never looked at you and said, well,
I don't come across with the artist,

3346
03:25:52,200 --> 03:25:56,760
some artist, artsy guy. Nonetheless,
very effective. Very effective.

3347
03:25:56,940 --> 03:25:58,530
Good way to support too,
by the way,

3348
03:25:59,490 --> 03:26:04,490
also on Amazon through Alexa,

3349
03:26:04,860 --> 03:26:09,000
if you want, you can order Jocko white
tea, Amazon Afghan. And by the way,

3350
03:26:09,001 --> 03:26:11,490
I don't know if I'll give
you some Jocko white tea.

3351
03:26:11,580 --> 03:26:14,250
And the reason I'll give it to you isn't,
I don't care if you like to,

3352
03:26:14,251 --> 03:26:18,810
you might not. You might hate tea. But
what this t does is it is a guaranteed,

3353
03:26:19,800 --> 03:26:23,910
it's guaranteed to give you
an 8,000 pound dead lift.

3354
03:26:24,840 --> 03:26:29,280
It's scientifically proven over and
over again. Double Blind, double blind,

3355
03:26:29,580 --> 03:26:34,380
placebo tested right there. Jocko
white tea, 8,000 pound deadlifts. Um,

3356
03:26:35,860 --> 03:26:40,250
yeah. So you got that also
her books, the books. Um, yes.

3357
03:26:40,320 --> 03:26:44,760
Get into the fire by Dakota Meyer and
being west. Get it through our website.

3358
03:26:44,880 --> 03:26:47,050
It's, it's an awesome read matter. We, we,

3359
03:26:47,070 --> 03:26:49,290
I covered less than 10% of the book today.

3360
03:26:49,560 --> 03:26:53,820
You only understand 10% of what the
whole situation was by listening to this

3361
03:26:53,821 --> 03:26:57,420
podcast. Get the book to support
the podcast at Support Dakota.

3362
03:26:57,870 --> 03:27:02,870
Learn about what these brave
Americans and Afghans went through

3363
03:27:06,090 --> 03:27:07,050
way the warrior kid.

3364
03:27:08,550 --> 03:27:13,260
There's a book I wrote for kids. Why?
Because who's, what kind of kids?

3365
03:27:13,261 --> 03:27:15,900
What kind of books were kids reading?
I know, cause I've got four kids.

3366
03:27:16,050 --> 03:27:21,050
My kids were reading books about lame
people that were being encouraged to be

3367
03:27:21,181 --> 03:27:23,760
weak. Yeah. Instead of
like, Hey, you know what?

3368
03:27:23,761 --> 03:27:27,720
It's okay to actually get after it
and try and be smarter and try and be

3369
03:27:27,721 --> 03:27:28,554
stronger.

3370
03:27:28,650 --> 03:27:33,650
So if you want your kid to be smarter
and stronger and eat healthier and work

3371
03:27:34,741 --> 03:27:37,830
harder, if that's what you want, you'd
get the kid where the warrior kid,

3372
03:27:39,090 --> 03:27:43,570
if you want to make your child
a week and on disciplined,

3373
03:27:43,630 --> 03:27:48,010
that's cool. You can buy any other
book for a kid and that's what you get.

3374
03:27:48,880 --> 03:27:53,880
And that book did good with
people and I wrote another one.

3375
03:27:55,810 --> 03:27:57,670
It's called way of the warrior kid too.

3376
03:27:57,700 --> 03:28:02,700
It's called Mark's mission and it's got
a whole new genre of issues that mark

3377
03:28:02,951 --> 03:28:06,670
has to face with his uncle Jake.
Uncle Jake comes to help out young mark.

3378
03:28:06,730 --> 03:28:10,150
Would you call them more advanced issues?
They are slightly more advanced.

3379
03:28:10,180 --> 03:28:11,710
Let me tell you which one of them.
One of the,

3380
03:28:11,740 --> 03:28:15,300
one of the issues that young marks or
marks in sixth grade now in book too,

3381
03:28:15,930 --> 03:28:20,930
he loses his temper sometimes and he
gets in trouble at school for Hawking a

3382
03:28:21,071 --> 03:28:21,960
paper machine,

3383
03:28:22,570 --> 03:28:26,900
Pumpkin at another kid's head
and it deflects off his head,

3384
03:28:27,160 --> 03:28:29,500
hits the teacher in the
face. Oh man, he gets,

3385
03:28:29,501 --> 03:28:32,260
he gets sent home from school
last day of school. Anyways,

3386
03:28:32,680 --> 03:28:34,960
he has to learn to control his
temper just like all kids do.

3387
03:28:34,990 --> 03:28:37,720
And I know this cause I got kids and
I know this cause I was a kid and you

3388
03:28:37,721 --> 03:28:40,270
remember when you were a little kid and
you lose your temper and your dumb stuff

3389
03:28:40,300 --> 03:28:44,950
evil. And when I say little
kid, I'm talking like 23
years old. I was like sure.

3390
03:28:45,310 --> 03:28:49,810
I was like, yeah, I do. You
know what I'm talking about?

3391
03:28:50,070 --> 03:28:54,910
They were, I got to go get you a
copy. Uh, his uncle and the book is,

3392
03:28:54,970 --> 03:28:55,810
is a seal.

3393
03:28:56,070 --> 03:28:59,650
It was a seal and he comes to stay
with them for the summer and helps them

3394
03:28:59,651 --> 03:29:04,150
squared away these little problems. Yeah.
Yeah. So that's what that one's about.

3395
03:29:04,300 --> 03:29:08,200
He also learns about working hard.
He gets a job, starts a business.

3396
03:29:08,740 --> 03:29:13,690
He's 11 years old, has his own business,
mowing lawns and pulling weeds.

3397
03:29:14,860 --> 03:29:19,180
That's way the warrior kid and where
the warrior kid to Mark's mission.

3398
03:29:19,650 --> 03:29:20,740
Uh,
you can also get,

3399
03:29:20,741 --> 03:29:25,270
speaking of which warrior
kids from Irish oaks ranch,

3400
03:29:25,330 --> 03:29:28,450
there's a young warrior kid,
12 years old business owner.

3401
03:29:29,080 --> 03:29:34,060
He makes soap from goat's milk right
here in California on his farm.

3402
03:29:34,930 --> 03:29:39,010
Yeah. That's cool. Wow. Yeah. Well,
it seems like, well, how are you?

3403
03:29:39,160 --> 03:29:41,770
How does you even,
why are you talking about this?

3404
03:29:41,950 --> 03:29:44,080
He got in touch with me and said,

3405
03:29:44,081 --> 03:29:48,340
I want to make good soap doco
soap, and I was like, well,

3406
03:29:48,760 --> 03:29:52,240
who are you? He's like, I'm a 12 year
old kid named Aiden. I live on a farm.

3407
03:29:52,540 --> 03:29:56,800
I'm starting a business. I figure you
might want it on the action Jocko.

3408
03:29:57,370 --> 03:30:01,870
And I was like, hey dude, how man,
let's do this. Maybe some soap.

3409
03:30:03,580 --> 03:30:07,600
You might want it on the AG.
I is. He offered me a piece
of the action. I was like,

3410
03:30:07,601 --> 03:30:11,710
Oh God, yes. Amen, man. Warrior
kid getting after it. And so yeah,

3411
03:30:12,010 --> 03:30:15,610
you can order that soap
at Irish oaks ranch.

3412
03:30:15,670 --> 03:30:19,780
He's dot com you know, no
big deal. Soap Empire, right?

3413
03:30:20,410 --> 03:30:25,030
What is like Johnson and Johnson probably
started off making soap. Ivory soap.

3414
03:30:25,120 --> 03:30:27,580
You think ivory soap doesn't
have some good profitability.

3415
03:30:29,400 --> 03:30:32,610
Only differences. This kid starting
at 12 you're guaranteed Johnson.

3416
03:30:32,630 --> 03:30:37,450
Johnson didn't start at 12 sorry,
12 get on there.

3417
03:30:37,480 --> 03:30:40,220
You just order some of,
he'll have kinks worked out before

3418
03:30:40,220 --> 03:30:44,690
he can even drive. Yeah. Yeah. He's
all over it. I mean, I'm telling you,

3419
03:30:44,691 --> 03:30:49,520
he's a manufacturing soap. You think
about when you were, um, I mean,

3420
03:30:49,550 --> 03:30:54,470
let's just, let's just get
all of our own, our own,

3421
03:30:54,471 --> 03:30:58,290
lose herself out on the table here. What
were you doing when you were 12? Right.

3422
03:30:58,580 --> 03:31:03,470
I was like smearing boogers on my sister's
daughter. You know what I'm saying?

3423
03:31:04,300 --> 03:31:07,960
We're just talking loser. I was
eating dirt. I didn't know it so poor.

3424
03:31:09,320 --> 03:31:11,000
I was still eating dirt.

3425
03:31:11,620 --> 03:31:16,540
Yeah. I, I made up the
slogan to simple slogan,

3426
03:31:17,220 --> 03:31:20,560
simple slogan. And it's, it's actually
a great slogan. You know what it is?

3427
03:31:20,860 --> 03:31:23,020
Jocko stope state clean.

3428
03:31:25,770 --> 03:31:28,510
You got it.
You got to admit it.

3429
03:31:28,540 --> 03:31:31,640
I gotta tell you a God who would have
been as good, sloping the good stuff.

3430
03:31:31,641 --> 03:31:35,410
Good stuff. I don't know. I don't
know how you came up with that.

3431
03:31:36,310 --> 03:31:39,220
I'm telling you, Jocko
soap stay clean. Right?

3432
03:31:40,900 --> 03:31:41,830
With Jocko store.

3433
03:31:41,940 --> 03:31:46,370
Yeah. Chuck clothes store. Real
unreal. Creative when it comes to them.

3434
03:31:46,430 --> 03:31:50,220
Them names. Uh, also, hey, another book,
discipline equals freedom field manual.

3435
03:31:51,600 --> 03:31:55,080
If you need to get on the path,
stay on the path and be on the path,

3436
03:31:55,500 --> 03:31:59,820
move further down the path. If you're
having trouble getting after it in life,

3437
03:31:59,821 --> 03:32:03,870
get the book discipline equals freedom
field manual and then don't just get the

3438
03:32:03,871 --> 03:32:06,630
book and read it. You have to
actually do something that's in it,

3439
03:32:07,320 --> 03:32:09,000
but it's pretty clear.
It's a field manual.

3440
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:14,010
Echo claims to know all about field
manuals and my favorite kind of manual you

3441
03:32:14,011 --> 03:32:18,530
actually know about field manuals go into
field manual that tells you how to get

3442
03:32:18,570 --> 03:32:19,980
after it so you can do that.

3443
03:32:20,280 --> 03:32:24,870
The audio version of that is not on
audible. You can't find it there.

3444
03:32:25,830 --> 03:32:29,760
Why? Because you couldn't cut it up into
tracks, which is what you all asked for.

3445
03:32:29,850 --> 03:32:32,580
It is on Amazon music.

3446
03:32:32,640 --> 03:32:35,610
Google play iTunes as an MP three.

3447
03:32:36,690 --> 03:32:40,980
Also extreme ownership.
The book that Leif Babin and I wrote,

3448
03:32:41,670 --> 03:32:44,400
it's about combat leadership.
Some of them actually,

3449
03:32:44,401 --> 03:32:47,790
every topic that we talked about
today when it came to leadership and

3450
03:32:48,090 --> 03:32:49,770
organizational issues,
it's all,

3451
03:32:49,800 --> 03:32:53,010
it's all things that are inside
extreme ownership. Get that.

3452
03:32:53,011 --> 03:32:56,460
And it's not just about war, but
it's about life. It's about business.

3453
03:32:56,730 --> 03:33:00,630
And on top of that, we have a leadership
and management consulting company.

3454
03:33:00,631 --> 03:33:04,860
It's called echelon front.
We solve problems through leadership.

3455
03:33:04,920 --> 03:33:09,920
Every problem that any organization has
can be solved through one thing and one

3456
03:33:11,041 --> 03:33:15,300
thing only leadership. That's
it. So if you've got problems,

3457
03:33:15,840 --> 03:33:20,040
call us Ashkelon front me,

3459
03:33:24,780 --> 03:33:27,480
Of course also we have the muster,

3460
03:33:28,230 --> 03:33:33,230
it's a leadership gathering
to leadership gathering,

3461
03:33:33,900 --> 03:33:37,140
seminar,
conference gathering.

3462
03:33:38,220 --> 03:33:42,990
And that's what we do. We,
we get together, we have
all kinds of leaders come,

3463

3464
03:33:45,030 --> 03:33:50,030
we give pragmatic actual tactics and
techniques on how to lead people.

3465
03:33:51,630 --> 03:33:56,630
If you want to like come to a conference
and get all happy and clappy and make

3466
03:33:57,360 --> 03:34:00,270
hugging promises to the guy
that's sitting next to you,

3467
03:34:00,271 --> 03:34:03,360
don't come to this conference.
That's not what this conference is.

3468
03:34:03,630 --> 03:34:07,860
We're not singing and dancing
at all. No. We talk about,

3469
03:34:08,010 --> 03:34:11,070
we talk about how to lead. That's what it
is. So if you want to learn how to lead,

3470
03:34:11,071 --> 03:34:13,050
come to the,
to the monster.

3471
03:34:13,051 --> 03:34:17,340
There's only two of them in 2018
only two of them. One of them,

3472
03:34:17,700 --> 03:34:22,320
Washington DC, May 17th and
18th. One of them. San Francisco.

3473
03:34:22,350 --> 03:34:26,550
October 17th 18th. That's
it. We're not going to,

3474
03:34:27,240 --> 03:34:30,390
what's the name of your
hometown? Columbia. Kentucky.
We're not going to Columbia,

3475
03:34:30,391 --> 03:34:34,740
Kentucky for the monster. We couldn't
find it. We couldn't, we couldn't,

3476
03:34:34,770 --> 03:34:39,480
your barn wasn't big enough to hold
it in. If we can we expand it? Yeah,

3477
03:34:39,640 --> 03:34:43,800
I'll, I'll work on it for next year. Work
on it. Uh, we actually did one in Austin.

3478
03:34:44,130 --> 03:34:46,630
If I'd known you at the time, you
would have been there. Awesome.

3479
03:34:47,190 --> 03:34:49,880
And let me know if you want to
come to one of these. We're,

3480
03:34:49,881 --> 03:34:54,150
but we're not doing it in Columbia,
Kentucky. Uh, we're not doing it in,

3481
03:34:54,570 --> 03:34:58,350
what's another random place?
Oh, mile call I Hawaii.

3482
03:34:58,380 --> 03:35:00,420
We're not doing it in Hawaii.
If you want to come,

3483
03:35:00,421 --> 03:35:04,170
you gotta come to one of those to register
a, by the way, they've all sold out.

3484
03:35:04,320 --> 03:35:05,700
We've done four of them.
They've all sold out.

3485
03:35:05,701 --> 03:35:10,701
This one's going to sell out to
register extreme ownership.com and we,

3486
03:35:11,940 --> 03:35:16,380
okay, we raised the prices once we
hit a certain date. Why do we do that?

3487
03:35:16,800 --> 03:35:20,250
Why do we raise the prices once we hit
a certain date to make my money? No,

3488
03:35:20,310 --> 03:35:21,960
I'm just kidding.
No,

3489
03:35:21,961 --> 03:35:24,870
we actually don't want people to do that
because what were the would reason we

3490
03:35:24,871 --> 03:35:25,290
do is we,

3491
03:35:25,290 --> 03:35:30,030
we want to incentivize people to register
early so that we can block enough

3492
03:35:30,031 --> 03:35:33,450
room, order enough food
plan, plan correctly,

3493
03:35:33,630 --> 03:35:35,790
get the venue set up the right way.

3494
03:35:36,210 --> 03:35:40,610
So we were trying to make people come
early. So we, it's actually a pen.

3495
03:35:40,680 --> 03:35:45,180
We're penalizing you for being slow
and prefer procrastinating. Yes.

3496
03:35:45,270 --> 03:35:47,580
Procrastination. You're going
to pay. That's right. Oh,

3497
03:35:47,610 --> 03:35:51,990
it's a procrastination penalty. I like
where you're coming from. If you wait,

3498
03:35:51,991 --> 03:35:54,810
you pay, I'll take credit for that.
We like people that get after.

3499
03:35:54,811 --> 03:35:57,290
Don't put that as one a Jockos.
Okay.

3500
03:35:58,100 --> 03:35:59,940
You'll get credit or get credit.

3501
03:36:00,120 --> 03:36:04,320
I think you get a percentage because
you were running off my lead and I got a

3502
03:36:04,321 --> 03:36:08,880
little cut. All right, so that is that.

3503
03:36:09,210 --> 03:36:13,500
And until the roster,
if you have questions or feedback for us.

3504
03:36:14,100 --> 03:36:17,670
We are, we are ready to receive
on the interwebs on Twitter,

3505
03:36:17,671 --> 03:36:22,220
on Instagram and on Dash Facebook.
He Blah,

3506
03:36:23,340 --> 03:36:24,121
echo is an echo.

3507
03:36:24,121 --> 03:36:29,121
Charles and I am at Jockowillink and
Dakota is on the interwebs in a big way,

3508
03:36:29,940 --> 03:36:34,940
in a big way on Twitter at
Dakota underscore Meyer.

3509
03:36:35,380 --> 03:36:36,130
That's how we linked

3510
03:36:36,130 --> 03:36:38,830
up by the way via Twitter.
That is, that was like,

3511
03:36:38,890 --> 03:36:40,840
I can't believe you responded to me.
It's so cool.

3512
03:36:40,841 --> 03:36:43,070
And I'm like I can't believe
you said something to me.

3513
03:36:43,860 --> 03:36:47,440
A couple of little kids on Instagram.
Dakota Meyer.

3514
03:36:48,010 --> 03:36:50,350
Oh three 17 sniper.

3515
03:36:51,100 --> 03:36:55,960
No just o three 17 Dakota Meyer.
That's, that's Instagram on Facebook.

3516
03:36:57,340 --> 03:36:58,510
Sergeant Dakota Meyer.

3517
03:36:58,720 --> 03:37:02,110
You can just look to go to Meyer and it
pops right up cause you're kind of the

3518
03:37:02,111 --> 03:37:05,890
man. You have a podcast,
you have your own podcast.

3519
03:37:06,460 --> 03:37:09,220
It's called owning it,
owning it with Dakota Meyer.

3520
03:37:09,250 --> 03:37:12,370
Now you kind of took that from my
book. Extreme ownership, no big deal.

3521
03:37:12,400 --> 03:37:14,500
I did take a little slice of that.
That's cool.

3522
03:37:15,760 --> 03:37:18,670
You Have Dakota meyer.com is
another place. So, like I said,

3523
03:37:18,671 --> 03:37:21,190
that's why I said you're all over the
interwebs cause clearly you are all over

3524
03:37:21,191 --> 03:37:24,070
the interwebs. You got a youtube channel.
Yeah, I've got a youtube channel cycle.

3525
03:37:24,240 --> 03:37:27,490
Uh, it's, it's just Dakota Meyer.
So I've got the youtube channel,

3526
03:37:27,491 --> 03:37:31,900
just Dakota Meyer where my podcast goes
up. It's on, on the dash on the dash.

3527
03:37:31,901 --> 03:37:33,490
What does that mean? Uh, so, you know,

3528
03:37:33,491 --> 03:37:37,450
own the dash comes from a point when to
Ellis had wrote called the Dash. And, uh,

3529
03:37:38,290 --> 03:37:39,123
you know,
I,

3530
03:37:39,370 --> 03:37:43,140
I felt like I felt like people in America
just needed something to hold onto.

3531
03:37:43,170 --> 03:37:44,320
And uh,
you know,

3532
03:37:44,321 --> 03:37:47,380
so I always look at what is success
and how do I want to be remembered.

3533
03:37:47,381 --> 03:37:49,480
And that's kind of like a
big thing for me. And I, uh,

3534
03:37:50,170 --> 03:37:54,010
so Linda Ellis wrote an
appointment, talked about how
like at a funeral, you know,

3535
03:37:54,011 --> 03:37:56,850
what man, so to speak, and you
referred to the dates, you know,

3536
03:37:57,030 --> 03:38:00,280
on the tombstone from the beginning
or you know, with the, the date he,

3537
03:38:00,700 --> 03:38:02,860
the person was born the day he died.

3538
03:38:03,670 --> 03:38:06,880
And really those are the two only two
days in your life that you don't make any

3539
03:38:06,881 --> 03:38:11,800
decisions or have any control of
and everything else.

3540
03:38:11,801 --> 03:38:14,650
What matters that dash in between.
And so how are you going to own your dash?

3541
03:38:14,700 --> 03:38:17,380
What is your dash going to look like?
Because you can control that.

3542
03:38:17,620 --> 03:38:21,940
You can control what that dash looks like,
how you know how fulfilling it is,

3543
03:38:21,941 --> 03:38:24,310
how selfish it is, how
giving it is. I mean,

3544
03:38:24,311 --> 03:38:26,440
you control it by your
decisions every single day.

3545
03:38:26,590 --> 03:38:29,080
And what do you want your dash to look
like? How do you want to be remembered?

3546
03:38:29,081 --> 03:38:30,970
Because it doesn't matter
how much money you have,

3547
03:38:30,971 --> 03:38:35,020
it doesn't matter how whatever you did,
the empires you built,

3548
03:38:35,021 --> 03:38:39,700
what matters is how you change people's
lives and that's how you're remembered.

3549
03:38:39,701 --> 03:38:42,820
And where your true success in
my mind is you'll be defined,

3550
03:38:43,420 --> 03:38:45,520
will be what people say
about you at your funeral.

3551
03:38:46,210 --> 03:38:50,590
And so that's where it comes
to me is his own the dash.

3552
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:54,460
It's where the idea of it came
from. So own your dash, you know,

3553
03:38:54,760 --> 03:38:58,090
and you do public speaking as
well. I do. I do. Public speaking,

3554
03:38:58,300 --> 03:39:02,140
I go around and do get in there and talk
to businesses and teams. Yeah. You know,

3555
03:39:02,141 --> 03:39:05,500
I come in and talk to businesses,
teams, give my leadership principles of,

3556
03:39:05,820 --> 03:39:10,300
you know, what I believe to make success.
You know, listen, I'm simple though. Um,

3557
03:39:10,360 --> 03:39:12,880
but you know what, what I
feel like, you know, my life,

3558
03:39:12,881 --> 03:39:15,730
I talk about my story and
kind of what happened, me.
And then I come around and I,

3559
03:39:15,760 --> 03:39:18,430
what does that mean to me? Right.
What does that mean? Like, you know,

3560
03:39:18,431 --> 03:39:20,050
every story without,
uh,

3561
03:39:20,450 --> 03:39:23,440
every story or experience that you go
through that doesn't have a meaning

3562
03:39:23,441 --> 03:39:28,000
afterwards is a wasted experience. And,
uh, so I talk about that and I just,

3563
03:39:28,001 --> 03:39:30,460
you know, did a lot, did a lot
of public speaking, trying to,

3564
03:39:30,730 --> 03:39:34,010
I just wanna inspire people.
I'm like, I just, you know, I

3565
03:39:34,010 --> 03:39:37,820
just want to, honestly, I just want
to change the world. No big deal.

3566
03:39:37,850 --> 03:39:40,730
Just want to change the world. That's
it. No, I just want to change the world.

3567
03:39:40,760 --> 03:39:44,990
Awesome man. Awesome. And he did. I, did I
miss anything else? No, I don't think so.

3568
03:39:44,991 --> 03:39:48,100
I think that's, I think that's
everything. Yeah. Anything,

3569
03:39:48,140 --> 03:39:52,800
any other projects or anything else
everybody needs to know about? No,

3570
03:39:53,140 --> 03:39:55,870
no. Listen, I can't, I can't tell you
how much I appreciate you having me on.

3571
03:39:56,110 --> 03:39:58,850
We're having some honor to have you
on echo. You got anything else? No,

3572
03:39:58,851 --> 03:40:03,600
thank you very much for coming on.
Thank you. Closing thoughts, Dakota. Hi.

3573
03:40:03,740 --> 03:40:08,090
You know, listen to this. Uh, I
got a lot out of this podcast.

3574
03:40:08,091 --> 03:40:11,010
I got a lot of, uh, you know,

3575
03:40:11,011 --> 03:40:15,440
and just hearing your perspective
and you know, uh, I just,

3576
03:40:15,470 --> 03:40:17,720
I just want people out there to know that,
you know,

3577
03:40:17,721 --> 03:40:20,810
I'm no different than anybody else.
The only difference is opportunities.

3578
03:40:20,811 --> 03:40:25,070
It's been put in front of me and um,
you know, I appreciate you having me on.

3579
03:40:27,370 --> 03:40:30,910

And

3584
