00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,270
This is Jocko podcast number
82 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,640
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,070
I was walking down the street okay.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,490
And I was pretty sure I would die

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,310
and I did not mind.
In fact,

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,440
a large part of me looked forward to it,

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,980
to that release to go to heaven,

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,450
to meet Christ for it all to be over

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,110
accorded death like a sailor courts,

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,210
a twirling Spanish barmaid.
I was not afraid,

11
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,390
even as we try to grasp broken streets
with asphalt and make shift concrete pile

12
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,110
like sloppy cake icing,
hiding the surprises below

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,840
large iads and screams and blood and
burning flesh and burning vehicle tires.

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:05,840
Okay.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,130
All superficially hidden,
all obviously present.

16
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,990
All a joke.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,530
Death had been at the forefront of my
mind and part of my decision to become a

18
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:20,700
soldier at all

19
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,680
and that's what I considered
myself, a soldier, a grunt,

20
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,760
an infantry man,
a ground pounder,

21
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,170
a soldier.
What else is there?

22
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,630
Yeah,

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,240
we all turned into soldiers on patrol.

24
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:48,940
We competed with each other and the men
and other units and other services to

25
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:51,700
see who could patrol in
the most disciplined way.

26
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,040
We would see who we could catch staring
at his feet or not watching his field of

27
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:04,341
fire or not scanning for threats or not
keeping his shooting hand on his gun.

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,740
Yeah,

29
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,630
and when the shooting did start,
we would watch to see who would panic

30
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,963
and who would cower.

31
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,950
These were seemingly fun games
and recesses breaking up the fear,

32
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,780
which was so overpowering.

33
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,160
It put a deep ache in our
stomachs and in our bowels.

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,190
There was chaos that
brought me to this point.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,130
Wild music as a young boy slayer,

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,760
Metallica in their prime venom Motorhead,

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,140
heavy alcohol use by age 10

38
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,970
drug use by age 11 late
night punk concerts and mosh
pits where I nearly lost my

39
00:02:57,891 --> 00:03:02,891
front tooth at age 12 as it dug
deeply into a punks shaved head,

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,510
I was tall for my age and
people treated me like an adult.

41
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,690
They tried to bring me into their filth.
Junkies,

42
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,900
perverts,
degenerates

43
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,030
and evil world
burning

44
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,400
so much. So that war, who
was a dream come true.

45
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,230
It seemed as if now I could fight back
against the depravity and evil that tried

46
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,020
to engulf me

47
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,780
and I held that quiet hope,

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,880
that unspoken hope that maybe I could
die in war doing something heroic like

49
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:04,000
they trained us to do.

50
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,710
Maybe this God forsaken and
worthless life could be over.

51
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,330
Yeah,

52
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,710
this gauntlet

53
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,380
and so the IED laden roads attempting
to scare me and us or a joke

54
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,640
and I did not care about it,
about the setup,

55
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,020
about the punch line.

56
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,640
I just wanted enemy contact and I
wanted to smell the blood of particles

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,300
floating through the afternoon air

58
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,900
and the screams of the dying.
That is what I wanted.

59
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,740
It seems so beautiful.

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,430
My mind had romanticized at all,

61
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,340
but what we got wasn't so romantic.
Isn't wasn't so beautiful.

62
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,900
Most of the screens I heard with the
screams of my countrymen as they bled

63
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,540
or the screams of innocence who were
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

64
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,530
I watched the funerals of men.
We shot going right past us.

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,120
The children crying,

66
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:32,310
the wives glaring as they damn us with
ancient Babylonian curses that would try

67
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:39,211
to follow me back to my home in St Tannic
nightmares where I could not escape

68
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,834
them.

69
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,450
Yeah.

70
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,450
All those things made def
so true and so beautiful

71
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,380
and so acceptable.

72
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,553
Okay.

73
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,570
No,
those words were written by

74
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,870
someone that I served with

75
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:16,610
in Ramadi in 2006 and he sent them to
me the other day after we talked and I

76
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:25,101
asked him to write down what he thought
about and he was walking down the street

77
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,350
in Ramadi and

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,100
obviously what he wrote about

79
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,110
get revealed so much of the,

80
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,540
the incredible spectrum
of emotions and thoughts

81
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,160
that run through our heads.

82
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,790
And obviously war

83
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,970
magnifies those.

84
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,450
Okay.

85
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,180
But these are thoughts of a human being.

86
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:03,370
And these are the kinds of
thoughts that people have,

87
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,440
not just in war but in life,

88
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,950
the struggles.

89
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,040
And as I was sitting thinking about,
you know,

90
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,030
that word and that the fact that struggle,

91
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,290
it absolutely shapes us.

92
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,370
And I was talking about this when I was
with Joe Rogan and Chris Cornell from

93
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,950
Soundgarden had just killed himself.

94
00:07:36,951 --> 00:07:41,951
And we were talking about the struggles
and Joe was saying that destroy you.

95
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,500
You got to kind of like struggle and
you need struggle. People need struggle.

96
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,650
And some of the feedback that
I saw on social media was,

97
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:54,261
you know,

98
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:57,860
there's a difference between struggle and
challenge and that a challenge is good,

99
00:07:57,861 --> 00:08:00,980
but struggle is bad. And,
and you know, I don't know,

100
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,220
and I'm not wishing struggles upon anyone.

101
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,330
I'm no guru.

102
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,570
But I do know that struggle
and strife shapes us.

103
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,490
Okay.

104
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:21,420
It shapes us. There's no
doubt. And I was always

105
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,450
thinking about this,

106
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,520
I started thinking about a bunch of
different books that I've read in the past

107
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,850
and one of them is a book called,
and we'd go on

108
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,550
and it was written by a guy named will,
our bird,

109
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:44,640
who's from Nova Scotia,
Canada.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,200
And he was a soldier in the
Canadian army in World War One.

111
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,560
And He'd enlisted in the
army to replace brother.

112
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,880
So his brother had been killed in
battle and he said, okay, I need to,

113
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,880
I need to enlist now. And at first he
couldn't enlist because he had bad teeth.

114
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,490
And then as more and more guys got killed,

115
00:09:05,491 --> 00:09:10,491
they loosened the standards and they
allowed him in even with his bad teeth.

116
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,380
And the book is very different.

117
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,060
Yeah.

118
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,330
And we're not going to go
through the whole book today,

119
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,820
but what makes the book different is he,
he talks about

120
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,120
like the supernatural

121
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,230
and he wrote another
book as a matter of fact,

122
00:09:27,231 --> 00:09:30,830
which is called ghosts have warm hands.

123
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,550
And so this kind of supernatural
world is something that he,

124
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,510
he spends some pretty
decent amount of time on.

125
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,240
Yeah.

126
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,420
And in the beginning of the book,

127
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:45,421
one of the things that he says is the
trench at zero hour was a crucible that

128
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:52,210
dissolved all insincerity
and the superficial,

129
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,610
and you can clearly imagine that these
guys getting ready to go over the top,

130
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:01,220
I mean,
what else matters at that point?

131
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,490
Everything that's not true is everything
that is not sincere just means nothing

132
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:12,110
at that point.
And I'm going to go to the book here for,

133
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,003
for a minute.

134
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,880
Okay.

135
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,290
In, here's one of the things he
said about sort of, again, I'm,

136
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,260
I've just started thinking
about the psychological side.

137
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,350
Yeah.

138
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,350
Of what people are going through.
So here we go to the book.

139
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,640
This story is an effort to reveal a
side of war that has not been given much

140
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:34,450
attention. The psychic effect
it had on its participants

141
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,360
there existed before all battles and even
in the columns of the trench routine,

142
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,960
a condition before which all
natural explanations failed,

143
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,590
that no supernatural
explanations were established.

144
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,240
Every human emotion ran its full gamut
in that land of topsy turvy and prolonged

145
00:10:57,841 --> 00:11:01,310
intensity of feeling rot,
feeling rot,

146
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:06,090
strange psychological changes
which warped the soul itself,

147
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,360
never on earth.

148
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Was there a place where a man's support
often as sole support was his faith in

149
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,500
some mighty power?

150
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,300
Yeah,

151
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,840
all intervening thoughts were
swept aside unconsciously.

152
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,430
There were born faiths that men carried
through critical moments and tortured

153
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:32,431
minds grasp fantasies that served
in place of more solid creeds.

154
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,253
Okay.

155
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,720
I think it's interesting that
he says warped the soul and,

156
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,380
and I don't actually thinking,
and again, I'm no literary expert,

157
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,360
but I don't think he means that with
the the negative connotation of warped

158
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:56,770
being negative and bad.

159
00:11:56,771 --> 00:12:00,670
But I think he means like a
departure from the normal,

160
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:05,671
a departure from the straight line moving
away from the natural direction and so

161
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:12,490
it leaves,
it leaves men changed

162
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,260
and like I said, I'm not going
to cover this, this whole book.

163
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,450
We'll probably do it at
some point in the future,

164
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:25,110
but I think when he gets to the end of
the book and he makes some statements

165
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:32,871
that are pretty powerful and of course
this is now after he's gone through the

166
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:38,010
war and he's on a ship
sailing back to Canada

167
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,310
and I'm going to read this section here.
We go back to the book

168
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,800
darkness,
the rush of the ship.

169
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:57,100
I felt my way again into a stifling
dug out into an atmosphere,

170
00:12:57,101 --> 00:13:02,101
rancid with stale sweat and breathing
earth mold and the hot grease of candles I

171
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,850
saw faces,
cheeks resting on tunics,

172
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,940
mud streaked on shave and dirty faces
with some with teeth clenched and sudden

173
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:15,550
hate.
Some livid with pulse stopping fear.

174
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,420
I saw men turning on their wire bunks
quivering as if some red hot grill.

175
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,560
I heard them gasp and sob and cry out in
agony and mutter as they tossed again.

176
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,930
Then a machine guns note louder,
higher, Sharper crack. Crack.

177
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:40,650
Crack has its sweeped over you in a
shell hole where you hug the earth.

178
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,710
Okay.

179
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,570
The growl of guttural voices,
heavy steps in an unseen trench,

180
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,310
just the other side of the black mass of
tangled Barb barricade beside which you

181
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:57,200
cower.
The long drawn wine of a shell.

182
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,940
It's heart gripping explosion, the
terrible, oppressive silence that follows.

183
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:03,970
Okay.

184
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,970
Then the first low wail of the man who
is down with a gaping blood spurting

185
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:09,934
wound.

186
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,640
I moved about,
shook myself,

187
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,600
sniff the salt air and tried
to rid myself of my dreams.

188
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,880
Then as I stood there,
there came a sudden chill.

189
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,920
I grew cold as if I had
entered a clammy cavern

190
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,340
I could not understand,
but went and got my great coat,

191
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,380
a dim figure past me. As I returned
to the deck and the voice said,

192
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,300
we're getting near home,
I can feel the change.

193
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,550
Ah,

194
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,550
I knew we had left the warm current and
we're into the icy waters near her home.

195
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,710
We had left behind the comradeship of
long hours on the trench post and patrols,

196
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,700
long days under blazing suns and
cruel marches on, cobbled roads,

197
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,640
the brotherhood of the line,

198
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,600
and we were entering a
cold. See, facing the dark,

199
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,180
the unknown.
We could not escape.

200
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,410
Dark figures came and stood beside me.

201
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,590
I had not thought that anyone saved
myself would come on deck and here they

202
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:32,210
were, 10 a dozen, still more,
all hunched in, great coats,

203
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,590
silent staring.

204
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,460
I looked at my watch.
There was three o'clock in the morning.

205
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,090
These men could not sleep.

206
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,410
They were come to see the
first lights of Halifax.

207
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,780
I moved quietly among them,
scanning each blurred face.

208
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,750
It was as I thought
they were all old timers,

209
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,120
the men of the trenches.

210
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:11,120
We went on and on and on
and no one spoke though.

211
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:12,470
We touched shoulders.

212
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,190
I tried to think of a comparison.
Ah,

213
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,890
we were like prisoners.

214
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:28,610
I had seen them standing like
that without speaking, staring,

215
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,200
thinking
prisoners.

216
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,390
We were prisoners,
prisoners who could never escape.

217
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:45,880
I had been trying to imagine how I would
express my feelings when I got home

218
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,580
and now I knew I never could.
None of us could.

219
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,700
We could know more,
make ourselves articulate,

220
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,980
then could those who would not return.

221
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,840
We were in a world apart,

222
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,920
prisoners in chains that would
never loosen till death freed us

223
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
and I knew those at home
would never understand.

224
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,440
They would be inpatient.

225
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,940
Wondering why we were so dumb on able
to put our experiences into words,

226
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,220
and there would be many of the
boys who would be surly taciturn,

227
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,550
moody resenting good intentions,

228
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,760
perhaps taking the hard
liquor and aimless drifting.

229
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,810
We have the Brotherhood,
could understand the soldier,

230
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,370
but never explained him.

231
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,560
All of us would remain a separate,

232
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,860
definite people as if branded
by some monstrous despotism.

233
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,733
Yeah,

234
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,980
but I warmed, as I thought
of all that, the Brotherhood,

235
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:12,981
it meant the sharing of blankets
and bread and hardships.

236
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,260
The binding of each other's wounds.

237
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,980
The talks we had had of intimate things
of the dog had simple faith that men had

238
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:28,400
showed flashes of their inner selves.
That strengthened to one's own soul.

239
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,753
Yeah.

240
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:33,900
Perhaps when my bitterness past,

241
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:39,170
when I had got back to normal
self to loved ones tried hard.

242
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:43,530
By years of waiting,
I would find that despite that horror,

243
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,120
which I could never forget,

244
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,620
I had equalizing treasure in memories.

245
00:18:50,621 --> 00:18:55,621
I could use like Jacob's ladder to get
high enough to see that even war itself

246
00:18:56,681 --> 00:18:58,930
could never be the whole of life.

247
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,790
The watchers stirred,

248
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,500
I tingled my throat tightened.

249
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,250
Okay.

250
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,010
Waves of emotion seized me,
held me.

251
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,570
I grew hot and cold at queer sensations.

252
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:26,720
Every man had tensed craned forward,
yet no one spoke.

253
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,440
There was the moment for which we had
live, which we had dreamed visioned,

254
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,210
pictured a thousand times.
It held us now so enthralled,

255
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,320
so full of feeling that we
could not find utterance.

256
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,730
1 million thrills ran through me

257
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:57,130
far ahead, faint, but growing brighter.

258
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,050
We had glimpsed the first lights of home.

259
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,360
That line.

260
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,843
Okay.

261
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,653
When he says,

262
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,080
perhaps when my bitterness is passed and
I could use my memories and he's saying

263
00:20:27,411 --> 00:20:31,640
he could use his memory's like Jacob's
ladder to get high enough to see that

264
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,150
even war itself could
never be the whole of life.

265
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:39,903
Okay.

266
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,170
And most of the struggles
he's talking about,

267
00:20:44,171 --> 00:20:45,760
those are the hardships.

268
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,540
Yeah.

269
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,050
And this,

270
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:53,050
this change in his mindset to
not let those drag him down,

271
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:57,800
but,
but to use those to climb up.

272
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,030
And I think, I think we, you,

273
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,950
we lose track of that sometimes

274
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,230
in all we see is the trench
and we get stuck in the trench.

275
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,550
And I think it's
interesting that these men

276
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,130
literally,
and metaphorically speaking,

277
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,070
these men were in trenches,

278
00:21:28,071 --> 00:21:31,430
but they were able to rise
out of these trenches,

279
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,510
these trenches of unimaginable suffering.

280
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,780
And I,
I think to myself,

281
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,580
if they are able to rise out
of those hellish trenches,

282
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,420
then that means we can too.

283
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,940
We can't do. And again, this,

284
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,140
this thing that my,
this thing that my buddy had sent me,

285
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,680
they just got me thinking about
that psychological turmoil of war.

286
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:18,590
And that sent me into thoughts
of another book. Again,

287
00:22:18,591 --> 00:22:19,460
another book that

288
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,410
I read a while back and reading
and remember when I read it,

289
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,330
but I just started thinking about it.

290
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,120
And this one was about Vietnam.
And it's, it's a classic,

291
00:22:32,121 --> 00:22:35,210
it's, it's called a rumor
of war. And, and again,

292
00:22:35,211 --> 00:22:39,320
we'll will absolutely cover this book
on the podcast in detail at some point,

293
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:42,740
but I'm kind of just was
on this literary tour mode

294
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:49,930
and the psyche I think is just a good
view of the psyche that people have in

295
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:58,190
war,
which again reflects

296
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,093
life.

297
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:07,390
And there's a section in this book
where Phil Kaputo is assigned to a rear

298
00:23:09,981 --> 00:23:14,780
echelon unit using the rear and you know,

299
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:16,130
he's a lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

300
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,000
He's in the rear and I think he's in a
regimental command post or something,

301
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,080
but he's not fighting.

302
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:26,860
And here's what he thinks
of that go into the book.

303
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:32,900
In the middle of November
at my own request,

304
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:35,990
I was transferred to a line
company and first battalion,

305
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,560
my convictions about the war had eroded
almost to nothing. I had no illusions,

306
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:45,140
but I had volunteered for a line company.
Anyway,

307
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:50,950
there were a number of reasons of
which the paramount was boredom.

308
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,930
There was nothing for me to do,
but count casualties.

309
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,180
I felt useless and a little guilty about
living in relative safety while other

310
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:02,380
men risked their lives.

311
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:08,220
I cannot deny that the front
still held fascination for me.

312
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,240
The rights or wrongs of the war aside.

313
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,510
There was a magnetism about combat.

314
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:22,450
You seem to live more intensely
under fire. Every sense were sharper,

315
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,270
the mind work clearer and faster.

316
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,370
Perhaps it was the tension of opposites
that made it so and attraction balanced

317
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:33,640
by revulsion.

318
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,730
Hope that ward with dread,

319
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,950
you found yourself on a precarious
emotional edge experience experiencing a

320
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:50,240
headiness that no drink
or drug could match.

321
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,910
The fear of madness was another motive.

322
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,560
The hallucination I had had and that
that day and the mass of seeing Maura in

323
00:24:59,561 --> 00:25:04,090
Harrison prefigured in deaf had
become a constant waking nightmare.

324
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,210
Okay.

325
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,190
I'd begun to see almost everyone as they
would look in death, including myself,

326
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,590
shaving in the mirror in the morning,
I could see myself dead.

327
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,290
Okay.

328
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,690
And there were moments when
I not only saw my own corpse,

329
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,970
but other people looking at it.

330
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,380
Okay,

331
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,210
I saw life going on without me.

332
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,780
The sensation of not being anymore came
over me at night just before falling

333
00:25:33,301 --> 00:25:38,050
asleep.
Sometimes it made me laugh inside.

334
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,900
I could not take myself seriously
when I could already see my own death,

335
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,040
nor seeing their deaths as well.
Could I take other seriously?

336
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,570
We were all the victims of a
great practical joke played
on us by God or nature.

337
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,430
Maybe that was why
corpse is always grinned.

338
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,800
They saw the joke at the last moment.

339
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,810
Sometimes it made me laugh,

340
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:12,990
but most of the time it was not at all
humorous and I was sure that another few

341
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,350
months of identifying bodies would
land me in a psychiatric ward.

342
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,580
Okay.

343
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,360
On staff, there was too much
time to brood over those corpses.

344
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,080
There would be very little time to think
and align company that is the secret to

345
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,760
emotional survival in war,
not thinking.

346
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,280
Finally there was hatred,
uh,

347
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,270
hatred buried so deep that I could
not then admit its existence.

348
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,150
I can now though it is still painful.

349
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,950
I burned with a hatred for the Viet
Cong and with an emotion that dwells and

350
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:58,680
most of us, one closer to the
surface than we care to admit,

351
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,870
a desire for retribution.

352
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:03,963
Okay?

353
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:09,050
I did not hate the enemy for their
politics, but for murdering Simpson,

354
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,760
for executing that boy whose body had
been found in the river for blasting the

355
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:15,140
life out of Walt Levy

356
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,470
revenge was one of the reasons I
volunteered for a line company.

357
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,520
I wanted a chance to kill somebody

358
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,060
and you could see even in that the,
you know,

359
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:39,061
comparing that with the first piece of
of things being a joke and how you just

360
00:27:39,311 --> 00:27:43,150
hard, you just get to this point
where things just become a joke.

361
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,040
How can you take anything seriously

362
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,130
would you don't even know what's going
to happen and if you're going to live,

363
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,580
how much meaning does life have?
If you're not going to live it,

364
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,510
it gets back out to a line
company and now he's on patrol

365
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,443
talking about

366
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:15,390
not only what that's like externally
but what it's like mentally.

367
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:18,150
Psychologically.
Going back to the book,

368
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:24,150
I tightened the shoulder straps of my
pack heavily loaded with signal flares,

369
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,190
smoke grenades,
dry socks,

370
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:31,280
a Poncho and three days
rations and entrenching tool
and machete were lashed to

371
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:32,514
its side.

372
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,460
Yeah.

373
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,290
In my pockets, I carried a map.
Compass, hand grenades, more flares,

374
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,250
Hallo zone tablets, malaria pills,
and a spare magazine for my car.

375
00:28:42,251 --> 00:28:45,700
Being a pistol to clips of ammunition,

376
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,840
knife first aid kit and two
full canteens hung from my belt.

377
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:54,990
My steel helmet and flak jacket
added 20 pounds to the load.

378
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:56,960
Okay.

379
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,820
The gear probably weighed
over 40 pounds all together,

380
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,380
but I felt a wonderful
soaring lightness in my limbs.

381
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,280
I felt good all over,
better than I'd felt in months.

382
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,840
Even Neil who is not inclined to hand
out compliments had praised my gung ho

383
00:29:11,841 --> 00:29:14,330
enthusiasm before the platoon left.
Base camp

384
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,980
as sudden and mysterious recovery from
the virus of fear had caused the change

385
00:29:19,981 --> 00:29:21,690
in mood.
I don't know why.

386
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,310
I only knew I had ceased
to be afraid of dying.

387
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:30,020
It was not a feeling of invincibility.

388
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,190
Indifference rather high.

389
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,580
It ceased to fear death because
I had ceased to care about it.

390
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,540
Certainly I had no illusions
that my death, if it came,

391
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,040
would be a sacrifice.

392
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,090
It would merely be a deaf.
They're not a good one either.

393
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,910
A good death involved a certain
amount of choice, ritual and style.

394
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,070
There were no good deaths in the war,

395
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:07,680
but the manner of dying
no longer mattered.

396
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,360
I didn't care how death came so long
as it came quickly and painlessly.

397
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,770
I would die as casually as a beetle
is crushed under a boot heel.

398
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:23,320
And perhaps it was this recognition of
my insect like pettiness that it made me

399
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:27,660
stop caring.
I was a beetle.

400
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,680
We were all Beatles scratching
for survival in the wilderness.

401
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,470
Those who had lost the struggle
had not changed anything. By dying.

402
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,530
The deaths of Levi Simpson,

403
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:48,310
Sullivan and the others had
not made any difference.

404
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,250
Thousands of people died
each week in the war,

405
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,490
and the sum of all their deaths
did not make any difference.

406
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:04,380
The war went on without them
and as it went on without them,

407
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,450
so would it go on without me?

408
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,490
My death would not alter a thing.
Walking down the trail,

409
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,790
I could not remember having
felt an emotion more sublime
or liberating than that

410
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,470
indifference toward my own death.

411
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,750
Again,
a

412
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,170
a common fought pattern is this,

413
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,260
this feeling of, Hey, I'm in hell.

414
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,290
And one thing that trying to set me
free is death. And once I overcome that,

415
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,470
that, that, that just allows me to
go and do what I'm supposed to do.

416
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:00,220
And I'm just going to fast forward
once again, kind of like a,

417
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:05,230
with the wheel bird going to the end
where we're Kaputo kind of wraps up his

418
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,600
what he's going to bring home from the
war. And at this point he's, you know,

419
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:16,160
he's obviously survived the enemy.
He survived actually at this point.

420
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:18,860
He'd survived a court martial
cause he'd gotten in some trouble.

421
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:22,040
There were some bad things that
happened while he was in charge.

422
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,800
There was,
you know,

423
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,950
cases against him and he kind of got out
of that situation and now he is heading

424
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:35,660
home.
Going back to the book,

425
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,930
we stood waiting in the
sun at the edge of the,

426
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,060
there were about 150 of us and we watched
his replacement draft filed off the

427
00:32:46,071 --> 00:32:47,390
big transport plane.

428
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
They fell into formation and tried to
ignore the dusty tanned ragged looking men

429
00:32:54,401 --> 00:32:55,390
who jeered them.

430
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,660
The replacements looked strangely young
for our younger than we and Awkward and

431
00:33:03,631 --> 00:33:08,631
bewildered by this scorched land to
which and indifferent government had sent

432
00:33:08,761 --> 00:33:13,010
them.
I did not join in the mockery.

433
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:19,820
I felt sorry for those children knowing
that they would all grow old in this

434
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:21,630
land of endless dying.

435
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,520
I pitied them knowing
that out of every 10,

436
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,570
one would die,

437
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:35,400
two more would be maimed for life on
other two would be less seriously wounded

438
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,290
and sent out to fight again.

439
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:42,420
And all the rest would be wounded
in other more hidden ways.

440
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:50,000
The replacements were marched off toward
the convoy that awaited to carry them

441
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,000
to their assigned units
and they're assigned fates.

442
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,970
None of them looked at us.
They marched away

443
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,820
shouldering our sea bags.
We climbed up the ramp into the plane,

444
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,110
the plane we had all dreamed about.
The grand mythological freedom bird.

445
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,581
Uh,

446
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:16,260
Julia shout went up as the
transport lurched off the
runway and climbed into the

447
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:17,340
placid sky

448
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,580
blow lay the rice patties and the green
folded hills where we had all lost our

449
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:28,040
friends and our youth.

450
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,640
The plane banked and headed out over
the China Sea towards Okinawa toward

451
00:34:35,711 --> 00:34:38,140
freedom from death's embrace.

452
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,040
None of us was a hero.

453
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,600
We would not return to cheering crowds,
parades,

454
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,870
and the peeling of great cathedral bells.

455
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,040
We had done nothing more than endure.

456
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,860
We had survived and that

457
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,900
what was our only victory.

458
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,203
Okay.

459
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:17,530
And I think that is important for us to
remember that in some cases some of the

460
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:21,260
things that we go through,
some of the things,

461
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:24,710
some of the challenges and tribulations
and trials that people get put through,

462
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,750
sometimes survival,
his victory.

463
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,400
And all you can do is survive and make
it through a situation that you're in.

464
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,070
And I think sometimes

465
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,590
when people survived something horrible,

466
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,280
instead of being happy or elated
that they made it through,

467
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:48,400
instead they focus on the fact
that they got put through it. Yeah.

468
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,710
And again, I don't, I'm no
professional at all. And there was no,

469
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,020
there was, there was, you know, even
when I was on Joe Rogan's podcast and,

470
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,750
and we were talking about Chris
Cornell committing suicide,

471
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,830
you know, someone said, you know,

472
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:09,850
cause we kind of devolved into
a conversation of hey, you know,

473
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:13,570
get outside and Tim Ferriss, when Tim
Ferriss was on this podcast, you know,

474
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:16,810
he was saying, you know, get move
and get physical. And so, you know,

475
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,380
Joe and I were just kind of
talking about that and, and,

476
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,290
and someone came on and said, you know,
you don't know what you're talking about.

477
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,870
It's, it's, it's, you're lucky to survive
something like this. It's horrible. And,

478
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:32,910
and you know, I kind of said, man, I,
I know I am. I'm not saying that. And,

479
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:33,611
and literally,

480
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:38,380
I re listened to Joe and I talking in
both of us of what we were saying was over

481
00:36:38,381 --> 00:36:42,130
and over again. I don't understand this.
I don't comprehend it. You, you know,

482
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:45,680
so I don't think that was the
intention. We're saying, oh,

483
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:48,610
all you have to do is go get it out of
kettle bell and you'll be good to go.

484
00:36:48,611 --> 00:36:51,850
That's not the intention at all.
And that's not what either one of us,

485
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,930
not only was it not what we were trying
to say. We didn't actually say that.

486
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,090
We were saying, Hey, I don't
understand it. I haven't
been in that position before.

487
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,260
That's why we brought,

488
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:06,460
that's why I brought Tim on here
because Tim had lived through that and,

489
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:11,490
and knew how bad it was and planned to
kill himself and so that to me is someone

490
00:37:13,151 --> 00:37:17,890
that can give their opinion.
Joe and I were literally saying,

491
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,930
I don't comprehend.
Yeah,

492
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,520
but I think when you get a guy like the
author of this book or rumor of war,

493
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,010
who's,
who's talking about their,

494
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:33,940
their victory or his victory and the
people want to play with their victory in

495
00:37:33,941 --> 00:37:36,550
Vietnam will survival was
just getting through it

496
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,780
and I know that's nothing
you're going to be joyous about,

497
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:45,430
but I think at least recognizing,
okay, I made it through,

498
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,780
now let me move on. Yeah. Is important.

499
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,210
Now again,
I,

500
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,190
I went on this kind of literary tour
that I was launched into after reading

501
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:00,510
what,

502
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,960
what my buddy wrote because it reminded
me of so many other things that I've

503
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:07,900
heard and so many other
things that I've read.

504
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,940
And so another great,
you know,

505
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,830
viewpoint comes from Eugene Sledge and
he wrote the book with the old breed,

506
00:38:18,831 --> 00:38:23,600
which is a classic and we covered it,

507
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,840
podcast number 10.
If you want to stop now,

508
00:38:26,841 --> 00:38:31,460
go back and listen to podcast 10
with Eugene sled with Eugene sledge,

509
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,060
with the old breed.
It's just

510
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,290
account of what he went through
in World War II, in the,

511
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,790
in the Pacific theater
with the Marine Corps.

512
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,580
But he wrote another book after that.

513
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,620
And the next book that he
wrote was called China Marine.

514
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:53,350
And it's talks about what
they did when the war ended.

515
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,963
You know,
and he,

516
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:59,970
the time he spent sort of pacifying and
any country spent some time in China and

517
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,430
then it talks about what it was like when
he got back to America, back to mobile,

518
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:09,890
Alabama.
And

519
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,650
it's definitely impactful,

520
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,120
definitely impactful.

521
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:21,650
So here's what he came to came home too
and then I'm going to pick up where his

522
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:22,484
dad,

523
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,520
he's talking to his dad and his dad was
a physician during World War One and

524
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,630
that's one of the reasons his dad was,

525
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,800
if you remember Eugene Sledge couldn't
get in the Marine Corps at first because

526
00:39:33,801 --> 00:39:36,800
he had, I think he had a heart
murmur or something like that.

527
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:41,690
And so they didn't let him in and
his dad was kind of okay with that.

528
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,470
And the reason he was okay with that was
because he had seen what the boys from

529
00:39:45,471 --> 00:39:50,000
World War One had come home like not
only physically but also psychologically.

530
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:54,230
Guys had
guys had the shell shock,

531
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,300
which is horrible when you see in
her, again, I've said this before,

532
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:01,120
go on youtube and look at videos
of world war one shell shock. It's,

533
00:40:01,121 --> 00:40:02,750
it's horrifying to look at.

534
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:07,100
And that's what Eugene
Sledge's father had seen.

535
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:12,020
And so when his son couldn't go in the
marine corps, he was kind of like, okay,

536
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,120
you know, you, you can
serve in other ways.

537
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:18,780
And Eugene Sledge wanted to
surf and so Eugene Sledge Guy,

538
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:20,210
he actually got a waiver and the,

539
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:23,870
and I guess the heart murmur had faded
enough or they didn't notice it until we

540
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:27,680
got the Marine Corps. When
he comes back, his dad,

541
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,940
his dad is talking to them and I
think it's a good place to pick up.

542
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:35,630
His Dad called him Fritz. That was, that
was Eugene Sledge's nickname at home.

543
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,160
So here we go.

544
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,020
Eugene Sledge's dad talking to him Fritz,
he said,

545
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:43,700
okay,

546
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,620
I know you've been through
an awful experience.

547
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:49,610
I know that nobody had it worse than
the First Marine Division except maybe

548
00:40:49,611 --> 00:40:53,660
those on Bataan and those
others who were imprisoned.

549
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,100
I'm tremendously proud
of both you and Edward.

550
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,080
You did your duty under terrifying
conditions, but you survived in one piece.

551
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,860
Granted with some terrible memories
you'll have to learn to live with.

552
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,360
Okay,

553
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,540
but take my advice first.

554
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:15,710
Never become embittered because
many other men had safe,

555
00:41:15,711 --> 00:41:20,420
comfortable war assignments all too often
obtained through political influence.

556
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,370
That's the way of cowards in this world,

557
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,503
okay?

558
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,840
To never feel sorry for yourself
because of what you endured.

559
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,940
On the contrary.

560
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,010
Feel fiercely proud that you served
with the finest and fought against the

561
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:41,610
fiercest enemy and live to tell the tale
three.

562
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,300
If you ever drink alcohol,
do it in moderation.

563
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,790
Alcohol can be a wonderful escape from
bad memories, but it is addictive,

564
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,110
will make you act the fool
and ultimately ruin you.

565
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,790
To the last remark, I
replied, I know father,

566
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,230
I've seen that happen to
good buddies recalling some
of the worst cases in China.

567
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,250
He replied,
yes,

568
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,030
and I've treated some of the nicest
people who were ruined by the stuff,

569
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,980
but I can't cure them.
They must have willpower.

570
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,933
Okay,

571
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:23,980
so really straightforward
warning about alcohol.

572
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:29,290
Check about not feeling bitter towards
people that didn't maybe do more.

573
00:42:30,831 --> 00:42:34,760
Go through what he went through
and be proud of what you did.

574
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,980
Now this is

575
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:43,690
again just another piece that that
they actually in in the HBO miniseries,

576
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:49,400
the Pacific, they vague kind of portray
this part of Eugene sledge coming home,

577
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:55,430
but it's worth reading his
account of it back to the book.

578
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,260
As my life settled down somewhat,

579
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:00,860
I began to think of my
future rather hastily.

580
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:05,861
I decided to go to Auburn then called
Alabama Polytechnic Institute and major in

581
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:09,770
business.
I'll never forget my first day at Auburn,

582
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,280
I was in the registrar's
office in Sanford Hall.

583
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:16,220
The big room was crowded with long lines.

584
00:43:16,221 --> 00:43:20,060
If entering students standing in front
of tables behind which clerks were

585
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:23,990
noticing or noting each student's
college credits from service schools

586
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:28,580
determining which might transfer to
Auburn, there was allowed hub hub,

587
00:43:28,581 --> 00:43:32,840
a voices with about a hundred
people in the room. Some men,

588
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,880
mostly air corps veterans had been to
various technical schools and Auburn gave

589
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:39,050
them two years credit.

590
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,610
All veterans were excused from
ROTC and physical education.

591
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,070
When I stepped up to the table that the
head of the line pretty Brunette about

592
00:43:49,071 --> 00:43:49,850
my age,

593
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:54,850
probably a student's wife asked pleasantly
what schools I had attended in the

594
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,210
Marine Corps. I recited all the weapons
and tactics schools we had in training.

595
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,990
She became more and more disconcerted as
she looked in vain on her checklist for

596
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:09,440
anything remotely resembling
what I was saying. Finally,

597
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:13,400
in desperation, she slammed her
pencil on the table and said it aloud.

598
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:17,000
Exasperated voice. Didn't the
Marine Corps teach you anything.

599
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,970
Okay.

600
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:22,510
A gasp ran through the crowd and
you could've heard a pin drop.

601
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:24,880
I didn't lose my temper,

602
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:29,000
but I realized that like
most civilians ward,

603
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:33,660
this lady meant John Wayne or
the sweet musical South Pacific.

604
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:40,010
Slowly placing my hands on the table
aware that all eyes were upon us.

605
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,190
I said in a loud,
calm voice lady,

606
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,020
there was a killing war.

607
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,660
The Marine Corps taught me how
to kill jabs and try to survive.

608
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,670
Now, if that don't fit into
any academic course, I'm sorry,

609
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:01,820
but some of us had to do the killing
and most of my buddies got killed or

610
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,534
wounded.

611
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,140
She was speechless.

612
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,690
There were many red faces among
the obvious noncombatants present.

613
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,680
I doubt if there were half a dozen
interim Friedman or tankers present.

614
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,470
She recovered her composure, looked
me in the eye and said, I'm so sorry.

615
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,140
I apologize.
I didn't understand.

616
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,190
I told her she was very kind and I
did not mean to upset her. You didn't.

617
00:45:33,191 --> 00:45:36,870
She said, you made me think so.

618
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:41,400
I got credit for ROTC and PE
and the room returned to normal.

619
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:46,470
Young lady wished me
a long and happy life.

620
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,020
I thanked her and left.

621
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,540
I felt like some sort of an alien and I
realized that this sort of thing would

622
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:56,910
confront me.
The rest of my days.

623
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,750
The war had been so momentous to me.

624
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:05,990
I couldn't imagine anyone not sharing
that view or pre or appreciating the hell

625
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:09,270
I had suffered.
In fact,

626
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:14,450
I was totally unprepared for how rapidly
most Americans who did not experience

627
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,190
combat would forget about the war,

628
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:21,990
the evils we faced and how incredibly
tough and had been for us to defeat the

629
00:46:21,991 --> 00:46:23,850
Japanese and the Nazis.

630
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:30,970
I didn't realize how swiftly
most Americans would once
again take their freedom

631
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:31,923
for granted.

632
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:37,603
Okay.

633
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:44,550
Clearly that applies to
veterans and people that have
been overseas fighting and

634
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:52,891
you come back and it's like no
one even knows that you were gone.

635
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,690
Yeah. It's like another thing, you know,

636
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:59,691
you get that passage of time when you go
away for two or three months and you go

637
00:47:00,221 --> 00:47:04,060
back to where you're from and it seems
like, oh, how long have you been gone for?

638
00:47:04,061 --> 00:47:04,841
All three months.
Oh,

639
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:07,810
it seems like people think you were
gone for a couple of days or a couple of

640
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,670
weeks. Yeah. It happens at the gym. Like
I'll go into the gym and someone who,

641
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:16,270
Oh, where you been, you know, I think I
haven't seen him in a week. And he says,

642
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:20,130
oh I, I tore my ACL. I been
gone for eight months. You know,

643
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,680
it's one of those moments. And that
happens with war. Two guys go away,

644
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,650
they come back every time,
just went by.

645
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:31,820
And that can be frustrating in those
eight months or six months or 14 months at

646
00:47:31,821 --> 00:47:35,200
someone's deployed overseas fighting for
their lives and they come home and that

647
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:37,510
other person didn't even notice
they were gone. Yeah. I mean,

648
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:39,940
I feel bad when somebody had an ACL
tear and I didn't know it. You know,

649
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,090
I feel kind of bad and I haven't
seen you for eight months, you know,

650
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,250
if you feel like I feel bad about it.

651
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:47,110
Okay.

652
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,340
And I'm sure that person is
saying, you know, Jocko gees,

653
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:52,240
we used to train all the time and you
didn't even realize that I was gone.

654
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:55,960
You thought I was gone for a week.
Yeah. Right. Yeah, exactly. Well,

655
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:57,610
imagine how that fuels to a,

656
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:01,540
a veteran that's coming back
from war and that is, this isn't,

657
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,220
this isn't like some odd case. This is
the norm. That's actually the norm. Yeah.

658
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,631
I mean,

659
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:10,900
it's different for the direct family
that's waiting for the individual to come

660
00:48:10,901 --> 00:48:14,830
home. Then those six month deployments
or 14 months deployment seemed like an

661
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:15,730
eternity.
Yeah.

662
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:20,860
But for that casual person
or that acquaintance that
you don't know that well,

663
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,430
they're thinking, oh, did you?
Where are you? Bend? Yeah. Oh yeah.

664
00:48:25,431 --> 00:48:27,340
I was overseas fighting.
Yeah.

665
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,533
And he's got,

666
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:37,490
the way he kind of wraps up this book
in his epilogue, and again, you know,

667
00:48:37,491 --> 00:48:40,680
this is another book that we'll probably
explore at some point in detail, but

668
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,010
going to the way that the topics that
he brings up as it closes it out and

669
00:48:48,011 --> 00:48:52,450
reflections on how the war
impacted him psychologically.

670
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:55,890
Here we go back to the book,

671
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,920
looking back over the momentous events
of 50 years ago when I was a marine,

672
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,990
evoke strong emotions.

673
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:08,310
The years immediately after
the war were the hardest.

674
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:09,400
Okay.

675
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,050
As Paul Fussell remarked,

676
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,820
the combat veteran not only
has to survive his experience,

677
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,760
he has to learn to live with
it the rest of his life.

678
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,330
Yeah,

679
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:26,330
he was so right for the first 20 odd
years after my return nightmares occurred

680
00:49:27,211 --> 00:49:31,980
frequently waking me either crying
or yelling, always sweating,

681
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:33,450
and with a pounding heart.

682
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:40,320
Some nights I delayed going to bed
dreading the inevitable nightmares.

683
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:47,120
Old Comrades wrote me that
similar troubles drove many
of them to drink and to

684
00:49:47,191 --> 00:49:50,190
the ensuing misery of alcoholism,

685
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:53,250
which they beat with
sheer self discipline.

686
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,080
Okay.

687
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:57,913
Eventually

688
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:04,750
the war left me with a deep appreciation
for the simple things in life.

689
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,530
Putting on a clean pair of dry socks
is one of the greatest luxuries.

690
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:17,790
I know.
A shave,

691
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,500
a warm shower, and sleeping
in a, she did bed or two.

692
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,190
When it is raining,
especially on an autumn,

693
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:32,060
I look out the window at the falling drops
and my faults sometimes drift back to

694
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:33,920
those awful days on Okinawa.

695
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,040
Snafu and die bailing out a muddy fox
hole with an old helmet shivering in a

696
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:44,051
torrential cold grain and both of us
cringing as each Japanese shell came

697
00:50:46,731 --> 00:50:51,560
screaming into the Corp Strewn area
to explode with a deafening crash.

698
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,530
That quickly bring my mind,

699
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,970
the focus of my mind back to the present
and thank God I didn't have to suffer

700
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:05,190
hardship and misery again
and oh,

701
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,090
what a blessing to be
relieved of constant terror.

702
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,430
My love of the outdoors was
strangely affected by the war.

703
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,340
The way I looked at my
surroundings was altered.

704
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
My view of the outdoors and taking a more
analytical perspective of its features

705
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:28,870
as military terrain, likely areas for
the placement of various foxholes.

706
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:31,890
The company, 60 millimeter
mortars to cover the full aids,

707
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:37,360
the light machine guns so as to
achieve crossfires along the company,

708
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:41,680
front fields of fire and possible
avenues of enemy attack or ambush.

709
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,040
This change in outlook was
intense in the early years home,

710
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:50,810
but I cleared my mind of it
by concentrating on plant
and animal species present

711
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:51,770
or probable,

712
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,290
but the old combat view
of things still creeps in.

713
00:51:56,291 --> 00:51:59,290
Sometimes after more than 50 years.

714
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,050
And that's something
that definitely sticks.

715
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,550
Every guy I know that's been overseas,
every guy, every thing we look at,

716
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:12,810
we see it as some kind of military
terrain in a city. For me,

717
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,140
especially it's in the city, cause I
did most of my combat was urban combat.

718
00:52:16,141 --> 00:52:19,140
And that's what I'm looking at all
the time. Not only on the highway,

719
00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:21,810
on the buildings,
when you're sitting around,

720
00:52:21,811 --> 00:52:23,760
when you're sitting in a hotel
room looking out in the street,

721
00:52:23,761 --> 00:52:26,790
everything that you look at,
you look at from a combat perspective.

722
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,063
Okay,

723
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,480
now he, he, he,

724
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,700
he was a outdoorsman and he goes back,

725
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:41,680
he gets back from the war
and he's going hunting.

726
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,700
And this is the first time that he's
gone deer hunting after the war.

727
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,580
And he's out hunting
with a group of people,

728
00:52:51,581 --> 00:52:55,690
but he gets dropped off in one spot
by himself. They have a boat by river,

729
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:59,290
they take a boat, they
drop him off alone. And

730
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,430
here we go. Back to the book to beautiful.

731
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:09,431
Doe's appeared walking briskly through
the water as they exited the woods and

732
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:13,550
stopped at the far edge of
the pond about 30 yards away.

733
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:19,870
They kept looking toward the area of the
drive and moving their ears to capture

734
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:20,990
every sound possible,

735
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,610
more loud sloshing of water and two doughs
and a large buck came up to the first

736
00:53:26,611 --> 00:53:30,330
dose and stopped.
They finally looked in my direction.

737
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,500
I remain still and since the
wind was blowing toward me,

738
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,540
the deer could not pick up my scent.

739
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,860
They stood motion motionless staring
at me and standing up in that clump of

740
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:44,664
cane.

741
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:49,620
They seem more concerned with the
bang of the hounds than with me though

742
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,450
because the way I held my rifle,
I could see my wrist watch,

743
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:57,570
so I timed the action
or inaction of the deer.

744
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,910
One of the dose picked up an acorn
at the edge of the pond and ate it.

745
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,240
The buck was large and it
had a fine set of antlers.

746
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,370
The eight points gleaming in the light.

747
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:13,110
Slowly I raised my rifle
and cited in on his chest.

748
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,153
No,

749
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,670
he was to find a creature to kill.

750
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,490
I had murdered one of his kind that
morning, so I did not need the venison.

751
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,200
Slowly,
I lowered my rifle.

752
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:30,130
Okay.

753
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,800
The buck remained motionless,
motionless.

754
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:39,030
His instincts probably told him no shape
such as he saw in the cane was natural

755
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:42,400
dear,

756
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:47,380
like most mammals have very poor sight
except for detecting motion and are

757
00:54:47,381 --> 00:54:51,810
primarily colorblind.
For 15 minutes,

758
00:54:51,811 --> 00:54:55,230
we stared at each other,
a shot in the air,

759
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,190
which send them springing away into the
woods, but a shot would frighten them,

760
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,750
which I had no desire to do.

761
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,720
The deer seemed more curious than afraid.
They kept sniffing the air,

762
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,090
which apparently bore no sense of danger.

763
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,860
I had on waterproof boots,
but was beginning to get cold.

764
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:19,950
Finally, I needed to move a little. I knew
that as soon as I did, they would bolt,

765
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,240
so I whistled softly every big year.

766
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:28,890
Turned quickly in my direction.
I whistled softly again.

767
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:31,470
All the deer slowly lowered their ears,
turned,

768
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:35,340
went sloshing onto higher GRE
ground and ambled into the woods.

769
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,100
Looking back at me once or twice.

770
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:39,750
Okay.

771
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,200
The whole episode is one of
my most cherished memories.

772
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:48,450
When Jim picked me up in the boat,
he asked if I had seen a deer.

773
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,890
I said, no, not wanting to
tell him I had seen five.

774
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,230
When we returned to camp,

775
00:55:55,231 --> 00:55:58,920
several people asked me what I had seen
and I reported a few squirrels and some

776
00:55:58,921 --> 00:55:59,760
wood ducks.

777
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,050
If I had told those eager at
hunters what had really happened,

778
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:06,330
they would have elected
to throw me in the river.

779
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,540
Okay.

780
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,720
Gus didn't allow any drinking
during hunting hours.

781
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:14,450
So after the guns were all unloaded
it and putting their cases,

782
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,620
the bottled spirits were brought
forth and the partiers all had a ball.

783
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:22,640
Each of the Wari hounds
went to the fenced yard,

784
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:26,590
jumped up on the raised platforms
and went into the barrel for a nap.

785
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:33,220
The platform was raised as protection
against high water as well as alligators,

786
00:56:33,221 --> 00:56:36,070
which have a special
appetite for dog flesh.

787
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,220
We crossed the river after a
while and scattered to our homes.

788
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,590
So when did my last year on put the memory
of that beautiful buck and his harem

789
00:56:50,691 --> 00:56:55,510
down the river.
I have wondered how long he survived.

790
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,700
I am not anti hunting as long as
it is managed by wildlife experts.

791
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:07,950
Most game animals out produce their
food supply and since civilization has

792
00:57:07,951 --> 00:57:11,550
destroyed most of the natural predators,
starvation results,

793
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:15,720
unless populations are controlled by
game management overseeing proper hunting

794
00:57:15,721 --> 00:57:16,554
practices,

795
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:23,750
but the terrified eyes of that spike
buck I shot are something I'd like to

796
00:57:24,271 --> 00:57:24,890
forget.

797
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,723
Okay.

798
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:32,040
I have felt the same terror when being
shot at, so hunting is not for me.

799
00:57:34,950 --> 00:57:39,240
World War Two gave me a convenient
measuring stick for duty,

800
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,980
courage, terror, friendship
patients, horror,

801
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,550
endurance, compassion, discomfort,

802
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,410
grief and pain.

803
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:50,370
Yeah.

804
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:52,620
That has remained with me daily.

805
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,480
The English poet Robert Graves said World
War One affected him in much the same

806
00:57:59,491 --> 00:58:00,324
way.

807
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,820
Anyone who has not suffered the
prolonged fear and limitless fatigue,

808
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,200
that was combat.

809
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:13,180
That was the combat infantry man's lot
might find this difficult to comprehend.

810
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,370
Over 50 years later,

811
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:22,550
I look back on the war has no what were
some giant killing machine into which we

812
00:58:23,131 --> 00:58:27,150
were thrown to endure fear
to the brink of insanity.

813
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:31,110
Some fell over the break

814
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:35,740
and physical fatigue to near collapse.

815
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:43,760
Those who survived on hurt.
We'll never forget and cannot forget.

816
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:48,940
The many friends lost in their prime and
the many articles of civilization they

817
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:50,600
ruthlessly destroyed.

818
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:57,970
As I look back,
some facts are quite clear.

819
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,460
Japan's sneak bombing of Pearl
Harbor destroyed many American lives,

820
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,200
ships and planes.

821
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:09,820
We had no choice but to
destroy imperial Japan.

822
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,730
The a bomb ended that war.

823
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,490
It saved millions of American lives by
preventing a murderous invasion of Japan

824
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,560
and the probable of a
suicidal Japanese population.

825
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:32,080
The Japanese soldier was a bloodthirsty
foe imbued with the code of Bushido.

826
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:39,210
If we had not defeated an army
that fought, it was unbeatable.

827
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:43,950
Who knows how many American
cities might've shared the
horrid rape of Nan King.

828
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:52,900
In looking back, I'm still amazed
I escaped the killing machine.

829
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:56,160
Why I never fell,

830
00:59:56,161 --> 01:00:00,840
killed or wounded in that storm of
steel thrown at us countless times,

831
01:00:00,841 --> 01:00:02,160
still astonishes me.

832
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:09,460
I am proud of the number of the enemy I
fired on and hit with my mortar rifle or

833
01:00:09,721 --> 01:00:13,110
Tommy gun and regret the ones I missed.

834
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:18,300
There is no mellowing for me.

835
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:22,500
That would be to forgive all the
atrocities that Japanese committed against

836
01:00:22,501 --> 01:00:25,440
millions of Asians and
thousands of Americans

837
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:29,310
to mellow is to forget

838
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:34,110
each man who survived.

839
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:39,350
I am certain was plucked from the
mire of death by the Almighty.

840
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:46,590
And in this I feel humble and grateful.

841
01:00:49,090 --> 01:00:52,120
Socrates said,
know thyself.

842
01:00:56,130 --> 01:00:56,963
I do.

843
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,200
The war taught me.

844
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:09,610
Okay,
okay.

845
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,490
The war
is how he closes out

846
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,910
that book.
And

847
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:25,720
the war taught me as well.
And the war

848
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,600
still
teaches me.

849
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,720
And that's why I read about war

850
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:39,280
and why I talk about war.

851
01:01:39,281 --> 01:01:44,281
And that's why so much of this
podcast is about war because war

852
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:52,020
can teach us,
but

853
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,590
it's not only war that teaches us life.

854
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,610
Life
teaches us,

855
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:06,663
but that's,

856
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:11,790
that's only if we are humble and open
minded enough and a tentative on enough to

857
01:02:13,571 --> 01:02:14,404
watch,

858
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:18,670
then listen and learn from it.

859
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:25,290
Not only from our own paths
and the things we go through,

860
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,540
but from what we see other people do.

861
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,780
It's a teacher.
Life is a teacher and yet,

862
01:02:35,781 --> 01:02:37,490
and you see this all the time,

863
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:42,140
there are people that
do not learn from life

864
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
and they make the same mistakes
over and over and over again.

865
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:54,161
Just completely unaware
of the lessons that are,

866
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,140
that are smacking them in the face,

867
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,690
smacking them in the face.

868
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:06,160
And I think that's where you have
to flip the switch in your brain,

869
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:10,890
that that hardship
that you're facing,

870
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:11,880
that trial,

871
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:16,350
that tribulation in bedded in,

872
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:18,660
that misery

873
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:23,323
is a lesson

874
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:27,463
to teacher.

875
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,640
And it's only a lesson if you're willing

876
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,793
to learn from it.

877
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:41,090
A hand life is a hard teacher,

878
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:45,973
but

879
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:47,730
do your best

880
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,380
to listen
and to learn from it.

881
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:02,190
And I know, speaking of learning,

882
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,150
I last

883
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,110
Facebook live,
got some,

884
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,660
some good questions and I know
it's a little, a rough transition,

885
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:20,600
but good. Um, you know, just kind of

886
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,540
going through all those different,

887
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,320
different people's books and you can see
what war did to him and you can see the

888
01:04:29,811 --> 01:04:34,811
similarities with all of them that
human beings put in really stressful

889
01:04:36,741 --> 01:04:41,240
situations, human beings putting in
life the have similar outcomes, right?

890
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,190
I mean there's,
there's commonalities in it.

891
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,790
And I think the more we look for those
commonalities in the more individual you,

892
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:47,630
me,

893
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,900
the more I look for these commonalities
and in different people's experiences,

894
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,800
the better off I'm going to be.
Right?

895
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:56,330
The more I'm going to be
able to understand what's
happening to the world around

896
01:04:56,331 --> 01:04:58,740
me or to the people around me.
Yeah.

897
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,400
And that's the one thing that I think is
really important as is seeing, you know,

898
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:07,550
when you start talking about the,
the life lessons hitting you in the face,

899
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:12,970
it's always hard if you're the person
that's getting hit, that's the, you're,

900
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:16,100
even though you're the person
that stands to gain the most from,

901
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,040
from understanding what's
going on around you, you're

902
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,850
also love the person that has
the hardest time recognizing it.

903
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:27,180
It's just like when you're sitting outside
of an MMA match or an Nmf MMA fight,

904
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:30,190
and you as the coach has the corner men,

905
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:35,220
you can see what's happening and the
guy that's getting punched in the face a

906
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:36,610
lot of times they don't
see what's hitting them.

907
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,190
And they don't think of it as a lesson.
They don't,

908
01:05:39,191 --> 01:05:41,110
they're not taking anything
positive away from it.

909
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:45,370
They're getting punched in the face.
And it's not until someone says, Hey,

910
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,890
the guy's hitting you with a left
hook. You're, you know, you're,

911
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,380
or you're dropping your hands or
whatever so that the person can make a

912
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:52,810
correction. They're not learning
from it. They're getting hit.

913
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:55,780
And that's what happens to a lot of us
in life is we're getting punched in the

914
01:05:55,781 --> 01:05:58,480
face, punched in the face, punched
in the face, and we don't recognize,

915
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,950
we can't step back.

916
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,750
We can't detach from being
in that situation where we
can actually assess what's

917
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:08,710
going on and say, oh, okay, I see
what's going on here. I see what I see,

918
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:10,930
what changes I've got to make.
That's why the,

919
01:06:10,990 --> 01:06:15,670
and then what happens is this is what
happens. What happens is you say, oh,

920
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:19,420
Echo, I see you're going through some hard
times. So I go up to you and say, Hey,

921
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:22,120
echo, this is what you're doing. This is
what you should change. And what happens?

922
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,750
Big Ego flare up from Echo.
You don't know how I feel.

923
01:06:25,751 --> 01:06:27,280
You don't know what's going on.
You don't know what it's like.

924
01:06:27,281 --> 01:06:29,200
You don't know what it feels like
getting punched in the face, bro.

925
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:30,880
I'm just trying to help you.
You don't get it.

926
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:35,740
So what we do our in our instinct is to
put up defenses even when somebody is

927
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:36,980
trying to help us out,
right?

928
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:39,640
So that means you got to get good
at trying to help people out too,

929
01:06:40,090 --> 01:06:43,960
because we already know that everyone
gets defensive and that everyone's ego

930
01:06:43,961 --> 01:06:48,961
flares up and that when you talk to your
friend that's either a vet coming home

931
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:53,410
and he's facing problems, or someone
that's having a hard time at work,

932
01:06:53,411 --> 01:06:55,930
or someone who's having a
hard time relationship or
someone that's having a hard

933
01:06:55,931 --> 01:07:00,730
time with whatever addiction has gotten
a hold of them, all of those things,

934
01:07:00,790 --> 01:07:01,840
you got to learn how to,

935
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:05,890
how to talk to those people in a way
that you're not being offensive to them,

936
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,090
which is hard to do.

937
01:07:07,091 --> 01:07:10,330
Cause we all take offense
whenever somebody tells us
that we're doing something

938
01:07:10,331 --> 01:07:14,290
wrong, we're all offended by
it. We're all offended by it.

939
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:18,670
Even the most positive, helpful
person. Your own your mom,

940
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:23,420
right? Your mom comes to tell you
something, you get offended, right?

941
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,880
You're your best friend comes and
says, Hey, you know you, you, you,

942
01:07:26,881 --> 01:07:28,630
you're doing this.
You're going down the wrong path here.

943
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,610
You don't know nothing about my path.

944
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:37,120
So having that detachment so you can
see it yourself and then having an open

945
01:07:37,121 --> 01:07:40,930
mind when somebody tries to help you
and then when you are trying to help

946
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:45,700
someone, trying to do it in a way
that you don't attack their ego,

947
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,940
those are some good things to think
about as you're going through life.

948
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:53,020
Trying to take lessons away from it.
So crazy hood,

949
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,670
apologize again, applies
to everything you know.

950
01:07:57,671 --> 01:08:02,230
It's like when will you ever hear
people say, if I knew then what?

951
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:05,410
I know now that of course,
right?

952
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:11,070
The jacked up thing is there's all kinds
of people that know now that tried to

953
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:16,040
tell you then there's so much,
there's so many places to get

954
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:20,120
this information. You're saying,
if I knew then what I knew now,

955
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,540
well then guess what? All kinds of
people we're trying to help you.

956
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:25,940
We're trying to help me.
We're trying to tell me what to do.

957
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:30,350
I wasn't listening to any of them. My
Ego's too big. I know what I'm doing.

958
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:33,170
I'm the smartest person in the world.
You don't understand the situation.

959
01:08:33,171 --> 01:08:36,590
It's going to be different for me. My
life has special, my life is different.

960
01:08:36,610 --> 01:08:39,770
You don't get all those things.
All those things that we say.

961
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:46,270
If we just had an open mind to listen to
what people were trying to tell us or,

962
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:52,630
or at a minimum have an open mind to
listen to what life was trying to tell us.

963
01:08:54,910 --> 01:08:59,840
It's hard. It's funny because
it's so true. Like how you,

964
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,930
when you're,
when you say,

965
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:07,150
if I knew then what I
know now and you say it,

966
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:11,280
we'll back then there was
people yelling at you. Yeah.

967
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:13,580
Screaming and metaphor thing yet,
right.

968
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:17,930
They're giving you that knowledge so you
could have known then what you know now

969
01:09:17,931 --> 01:09:21,710
kind of thing. Then you got to
go one step deeper and go, Dang,

970
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:24,890
well I should've known then to
listen to you guys. You know?

971
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:29,240
I know to listen to you guys now
kind of thing, man. It's like,

972
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:34,790
it's almost like this borderline
impossible scenario. It's hard scenario.

973
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,920
There's some things in life,

974
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:41,930
and this is so unfortunate that
you have to learn only from life.

975
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,180
There's all these stupid things that
people go through and you just, you just,

976
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,120
you watching them go through
it. Yeah. And, and again,

977
01:09:50,121 --> 01:09:52,850
I talk about this story
where you, you, you get,

978
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:55,220
you get someone that's going
down a downward spiral.

979
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,380
You pick the downward
spiral that they're on,

980
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,070
whether it's their relationship
that they're in is a disaster.

981
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:05,660
Whether they're getting addicted to
whatever you want to get addicted to,

982
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:09,950
you know, whether that's
work, whether that's alcohol,

983
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:12,890
whether that's drugs,
whether that's gambling,

984
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:14,480
whatever thing you want to be addicted to,

985
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,970
you pick the downward spiral
that you want to jump on.

986
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:20,630
The person that's on that downward spiral.
It,

987
01:10:20,631 --> 01:10:25,610
they don't see it in everybody that's
outside of the spiral can absolutely

988
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:30,320
identify it and tell them, and they don't
want to get off. I mean, I know, hey,

989
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:35,180
addictions are horrible. Right? And
that's why they're called addictions.

990
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:38,390
And that's why people ride that
downward spiral until it destroys him.

991
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,670
Like Eugene Sledge's dad talked about.
It's like, Hey, it'll ruin you. Yeah.

992
01:10:43,730 --> 01:10:46,490
The only way out is willpower.
The only way out.

993
01:10:46,491 --> 01:10:49,880
And then Eugene says you got to defeat
it with pure self discipline, you know?

994
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:55,430
Yeah, you can, you can have fun
little games with your mind.

995
01:10:55,431 --> 01:10:58,370
And when they're little
like chess matches,

996
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:02,730
which with your mind with alcohol,
I know that from experience and um,

997
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,780
I'm winning.
When we first started doing the podcast,

998
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:09,560
I didn't realize that you drank as
much as you drank at that time. Yeah,

999
01:11:09,950 --> 01:11:13,810
I was like, cause we
were recording. Yeah, we

1000
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,110
poured one out. I was like,
what are you doing bro?

1001
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:19,220
I'm like in here to get after it.
And you're,

1002
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:20,990
you're going to have a drink during this.
Yeah.

1003
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:26,420
Well in my slight defense that one
drink wouldn't really affect anything.

1004
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:34,110
And I know this because other people told
me this and I feel this where even if

1005
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:37,260
I'll get hammered, this was back
then you couldn't really tell.

1006
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,050
People would be like, oh,
you don't even seem at all.

1007
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:43,710
Meanwhile on the inside I'm like,
but yeah.

1008
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,520
And here's another thing, and this
can apply to a lot of people. I think,

1009
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:48,991
not everybody,

1010
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:52,980
but maybe some people where you know
how I was the kind of where I would only

1011
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:56,640
drink at home when I did work. Here's
the thing though, I works bizarre thing.

1012
01:11:56,670 --> 01:11:57,503
Yeah.

1013
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,560
To The textbook definition of an alcoholic
drinking at home alone while you're

1014
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:02,394
working.

1015
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:07,320
I'm sure it's one of the potential
symptoms but straight but on potential,

1016
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:10,470
when I went to like the bar
or something like hang out,

1017
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,560
I didn't really go to the cloud.

1018
01:12:11,561 --> 01:12:14,190
I mean after I stopped working
in the club I heard do it, but

1019
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,020
you know to go hang out and stuff,
I drink way less.

1020
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:22,440
I wouldn't even really want to drink that
much but at homework and that's when I

1021
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,850
would drink.
But like I said,

1022
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:28,080
I work every single night
and for a long time too.

1023
01:12:28,081 --> 01:12:31,230
So he was like every night for
like years and years and years.

1024
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,060
But the only problem that it would kind
of create where these kind of covert

1025
01:12:36,061 --> 01:12:39,870
problems like the next day I wasn't,
is driven to do much.

1026
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,020
I'd work out a go train, I do
all the stuff that, you know,

1027
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:46,350
I've been doing for whatever years.
But you know,

1028
01:12:46,351 --> 01:12:49,350
like how you learn something new to bring,
you know,

1029
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,470
Xyz element of your life to
the next level kind of thing.

1030
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:56,280
It would really get in the way of that.
So, so you're kind of stay in that level,

1031
01:12:56,281 --> 01:12:58,650
like three. Yeah. But
here's the thing though,

1032
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:02,220
in certain ways I was learning a lot
because you learn a lot when when I work

1033
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:05,670
and stuff, when I do, you know all
these programs and do video stuff,

1034
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:08,970
you learn a lot while
you do it. So man, I was,

1035
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,320
I was learning and getting better and
my stuff. So in a way the problems,

1036
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:16,200
like I said, weren't real obvious. And
then after awhile, like after time goes,

1037
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:19,380
you know what it was what really
brought the problems to late was fucking

1038
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:22,200
hanging with you because you'd
be like, okay, we're here now.

1039
01:13:22,201 --> 01:13:25,620
We're going here to this week.
We're on like a whole different thing.

1040
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:29,550
And I'm like, man, I can hardly keep
up with Jocko. So at night I'd be like,

1041
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:29,821
Oh yeah,

1042
01:13:29,821 --> 01:13:33,180
I'm keeping up with Jakob and the next
day I'm thinking when you're doing stuff

1043
01:13:33,181 --> 01:13:36,450
early in the morning doing stuff during
the day, you're letting me know, okay,

1044
01:13:36,451 --> 01:13:37,770
now we've got this. And I'm like, Dang,

1045
01:13:37,771 --> 01:13:41,700
I just basically been recovering at
all day because I don't feel that good.

1046
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:46,140
I did a workout as we used to record
the podcast at night, later at night.

1047
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:49,910
And so we'd get done at one
o'clock in the morning and yeah,

1048
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,150
I'd have to get after it in the morning
and not have to. Yeah, exactly right.

1049
01:13:54,151 --> 01:13:57,840
So it's weird when you do that routine,

1050
01:13:57,841 --> 01:13:59,190
you get this weird second.

1051
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,940
I think your body just gets
ready to do work and stuff.

1052
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,200
You know how you do
something over and over.

1053
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:07,800
Your body just kind of just accommodates
the schedule. So I was like,

1054
01:14:07,801 --> 01:14:10,400
at night I'd do fine, but during the
day I wouldn't want to do nothing.

1055
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:12,040
And meanwhile you're, you know, doing

1056
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,240
all this stuff. And I was like, man.

1057
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,420
And not to mention all the things that
we talked about that I was like, oh,

1058
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:20,650
I got tricked by my brain. [inaudible]
meanwhile at the expense of my whole life.

1059
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,980
Aside from those, you
know, for the next for you,

1060
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:27,910
is that because you were kind of the
cause of the problems were covert?

1061
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:29,170
There wasn't any,

1062
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:33,700
I'm assuming that there wasn't any
external people trying to help you and be

1063
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:34,510
like, Hey Echo, you're,

1064
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:38,240
you shouldn't drink at night because you
were still maintaining an unacceptable

1065
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:42,280
standard of humanity. So, and you,
you're taking care of your wife,

1066
01:14:42,281 --> 01:14:45,730
you're taking care of your young
daughter and so you're doing what you're

1067
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,510
responsible to do, your what your
responsibilities are. We're being handled.

1068
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,360
They're just being handled at level
three and level three was okay.

1069
01:14:52,361 --> 01:14:55,190
Maybe people thought that was where
you were at. You know, actually,

1070
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:57,820
and this may sound better,
but this is worse.

1071
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,120
They were being held at level
essentially level 10 everything.

1072
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:05,410
Like everything I cared
about was being handled.

1073
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:10,150
Everything like to the really high level,
like hanging with the kids,

1074
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:13,630
talking with them. So my wife
would go to bed earlier than me.

1075
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:18,400
So then you'd say of late working,
working, drinking, I could still wake up.

1076
01:15:18,401 --> 01:15:19,870
I'd be messy, you know, not,

1077
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:24,910
not that like happy to be awake, but
I wouldn't, that wouldn't, never,

1078
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:27,100
that would never show
dealing with other people.

1079
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,850
And then there'd be times where I feel
if I was just too, and really it just,

1080
01:15:30,851 --> 01:15:34,240
I just felt tired. That's what it was.
I didn't feel hung over. You know,

1081
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:37,900
this is actually brings up a good point
is that I think a lot of times people

1082
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,570
spend,
because they're,

1083
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,250
because they're achieving a minimum
standard, or maybe even a medium standard

1084
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:49,960
or a solid standard. In your
case, from your perspective

1085
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:56,010
to me was I was working.
Yeah, you're working, you're
getting your job done. Yeah.

1086
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:00,760
Making, making good care of your
family and doing workouts like hard,

1087
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:04,000
good workouts during the day. But
everything else, I was like, oh my God,

1088
01:16:04,470 --> 01:16:07,120
I can't do this.
But I bet there's always,

1089
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:12,610
so basically if you're not looking
at yourself with a critical eye,

1090
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,940
you can get by with a lot as a person,
as a human being you.

1091
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,900
If you're not looking, if you're not
looking at yourself with a critical eye,

1092
01:16:20,170 --> 01:16:21,940
you are going to get you.

1093
01:16:21,941 --> 01:16:24,100
You're not going to reach your potential
because you're not going to push

1094
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:27,700
yourself as hard as you possibly
can, which is, you know,

1095
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:32,420
the MMA fighters, when I was trained, a
lot of MMA fighters, I would tell them,

1096
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:37,060
listen, you can train without
a coach and you can train to,

1097
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:39,760
let's say,
let's say you're super disciplined.

1098
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:45,910
You can get to like 84% this
is an interesting dichotomy.

1099
01:16:46,090 --> 01:16:49,840
You can get to 84% of your max
output of you're pushing yourself.

1100
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:55,920
A coach is then going to take you to the
next level and he's going to get you to

1101
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:59,920
98% but this is what's interesting.

1102
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,490
The last 2% goes back on the individual.

1103
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:07,660
So let's say I'm training
you for Jujitsu tournament.

1104
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,370
If you just yourself with
a Jujitsu tournament,

1105
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:14,960
you get to 80 82% of your potential. If
I, cause that means cause you're, you're,

1106
01:17:14,961 --> 01:17:17,420
you know, you get to the last round and
you look at your to be a, you know what,

1107
01:17:17,421 --> 01:17:19,550
I'm probably, I might get hurt this
round so I'm gonna take it off.

1108
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,530
Like you know you're going
to make all those excuses.

1109
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:25,220
You're not going to old
hold the line right now.

1110
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:28,640
If I'm training you now I'm
going, okay. Okay. Okay. You've
got to be here. Get back.

1111
01:17:28,641 --> 01:17:30,470
Are you going to do in two more
rounds? Hey, you're done with your,

1112
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:33,230
you can do some burpees and you know I'm
gonna, I'm gonna make you do that stuff.

1113
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:37,160
So that's what a coach does,
but then you take that last,

1114
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:42,190
that's going to get you to 98% but the
last 2% is back to you because I can't

1115
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:47,390
make you do the burpees
as hard as you can.

1116
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:51,710
I can make you do them, but I can't make
you do them as hard as you can. I can,

1117
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:54,440
I can make you do
another round on the mat,

1118
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,710
but I can't make you do
it as hard as you can.

1119
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:02,160
I can't make you try moves that I,

1120
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:04,030
that you don't feel like trying.
Yeah.

1121
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:09,200
So it takes a little teamwork
in those situations, you know?

1122
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:13,070
And that's something
I definitely saw with,

1123
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,640
with MMA fighters is yeah.
Without a coach,

1124
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:19,400
they're not going to push
themselves hard with a coach.

1125
01:18:19,401 --> 01:18:22,250
They'll push themselves harder.
But if you're going to be a champion,

1126
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:26,450
you got to get that last 2% of yourself.
Yeah. And what's crazy is you can,

1127
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:30,890
you can kind of make someone your coach,
even if they don't know it, you know,

1128
01:18:30,891 --> 01:18:34,220
how like, um, where, I mean,

1129
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:36,950
I think you'd kind of know that
you're kind of the coach, you know,

1130
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,380
as far as cause your coaching,

1131
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,570
probably anyone who interacts
with you and in a regular basis,

1132
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,470
they're going to kind of at the very least
look at you and know that you wake up

1133
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,610
early and get a lot done for, for a
reason, by the way. So they know that.

1134
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,000
So it's kind of like, okay,
I can follow suit. You know,

1135
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:56,880
I can take cues from Jocko in
this way and I can approve it.

1136
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,480
It doesn't have to be in the
exact things that you're doing,

1137
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:04,070
but just stuff that they do.
So I think if you actively do that,

1138
01:19:04,430 --> 01:19:08,960
where, I mean, I'm speaking from a
place of supreme luxury by the way,

1139
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,700
in regards to this where,
you know, I'm like,

1140
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:14,960
you're talking about it directly to me
every single week. And I'm like, yes sir.

1141
01:19:14,961 --> 01:19:18,170
And I go back and try it, you know,
try my best to apply it to my stuff.

1142
01:19:18,171 --> 01:19:20,180
So of course,
but you can do that.

1143
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:24,070
Even if you watch someone on,
I don't know,

1144
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:26,630
online or something or you read it,

1145
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:30,350
you know how people do like blogs
and stuff like that. You know,

1146
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:33,840
if you're like a subscriber to a specific
blog and you really like, you know,

1147
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,580
to the way they do things or whatever,
you can,

1148
01:19:37,581 --> 01:19:41,230
you can get that same effect
in a smaller way, I think. Um,

1149
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:44,620
but you can get that same content
can definitely, but you just,

1150
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:47,620
you gotta be conscious of it
though and how you say it.

1151
01:19:47,621 --> 01:19:52,520
Like you have to have your own self. Like
it's self discipline for sure. But um,

1152
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,830
what did you say?
You just said it's self awareness.

1153
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,520
Look at yourself with a critical
eye that you got to do that.

1154
01:19:58,521 --> 01:20:01,970
And here's the opposite of that.
In my opinion and from what I seen,

1155
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:06,410
the enemy of looking at yourself with a
critical eye is being good at justifying

1156
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,610
stuff. Yeah. Especially,

1157
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:13,080
you know how they say smart people are
dangerous in that way because they're

1158
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:14,870
really good at,
because yeah,

1159
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,570
rationalizing something in justifying
something is exactly what it is,

1160
01:20:18,670 --> 01:20:21,510
is exactly what that says.
It's justifying it.

1161
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,440
Are you justified in x, Y,
z? And if you are, you are.

1162
01:20:25,441 --> 01:20:29,220
So if you can justify something to
yourself and you're good at it, yes. Okay.

1163
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:32,310
In your mind is literally okay.
It's not a good situation. It's,

1164
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:34,750
it's very dangerous. Yes. He's
a very dangerous critical,

1165
01:20:34,770 --> 01:20:39,060
I've got just the critical, let
me write, call yourself out.

1166
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:39,930
Yeah.

1167
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:44,250
If you want to reach your maximum
potential and move from level three to at

1168
01:20:44,251 --> 01:20:46,710
least level eight man.

1169
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:53,090
So what I was saying is that got some
pretty good little rapid fire questions.

1170
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:54,661
You know,

1171
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:57,240
I didn't want to take a bunch of time
on them but I just want to at least

1172
01:20:57,241 --> 01:21:01,140
address some of the questions that
came on the Facebook he live. Sure.

1173
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:07,130
I've got a stack of questions that have
been coming in on Facebook and Twitter

1174
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,280
and those two primarily is worth the
big questions come into and I've got a

1175
01:21:13,711 --> 01:21:16,560
stack of those that we'll get around
to in a Q and a at some point.

1176
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:22,440
And also a lot of questions that get
asked right now heard them before.

1177
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,630
So if you have a question,

1178
01:21:24,631 --> 01:21:28,450
if you haven't listened to the podcast
at this point you might want us to just

1179
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:31,890
go back and listen to the other contrast
because the question that you have

1180
01:21:31,950 --> 01:21:36,950
about how many hours I sleep at night
and what time I go to bed and you know

1181
01:21:38,491 --> 01:21:41,460
those kinds of things, they're
there in the podcast and you don't,

1182
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,830
I'm not going to talk about
them too much anymore.

1183
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:47,430
You can have like you're
watching jeopardy.

1184
01:21:47,431 --> 01:21:52,431
There would have been something cool about
stopping the podcast at number 25 and

1185
01:21:54,841 --> 01:21:56,280
said that's it.
That's all you get.

1186
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,880
And just cause we addressed a bunch of
stuff and then just let it marinate for a

1187
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:07,860
while. That would be season one. You know
how they do that and been a good idea.

1188
01:22:08,370 --> 01:22:09,360
Yeah.
We should have done that.

1189
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:14,361
We should have done season one and
then paused and let people really have

1190
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:20,420
marinated that first season and
then season two comes and see.

1191
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:26,970
I like that. You wouldn't,
you wouldn't never let that
happen. That's what I think.

1192
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,600
Well it depends cause it
strategically it's a good idea.

1193
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:34,670
It's a strategically good idea.
Yeah,

1194
01:22:35,190 --> 01:22:38,160
I think it is because also you're going
to let that stuff marinate and then

1195
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:42,390
you're going to get good feedback on a
bulk of work that people can then say,

1196
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:45,780
hey, this was a good area of
topics that you discussed.

1197
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:50,370
Please readdress and hit the
following concerns. Right, right.

1198
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,450
And so we could attack those, those
concerns in such a manner. Yeah.

1199
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:58,530
I guess that's one way here,
limit, I think this is,

1200
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,650
I'm speaking selfishly here,

1201
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:07,240
but I think this is a big deal
where even if you repeat yourself,

1202
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:09,670
even if you answer the same question,

1203
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:14,380
literally the same questions over
and over again, it's like, you know,

1204
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:18,010
when you go to school or college or
whatever and you get a review every week.

1205
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,240
I think that, yeah, it is. And you just
choose. The best example for me is,

1206
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:24,870
do I ever, I never absorb a
move in the first try. Yeah.

1207
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,400
You gotta give you gotta
teach 12 different times.

1208
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:31,900
I learn one 12th of it each
time and then 12 times later,

1209
01:23:31,901 --> 01:23:36,730
I know the whole move. Perfect analogy. If
you Jacqueline's telling echo, yeah. Hey,

1210
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:40,390
don't complain, like don't
complain, problem-solve, don't,

1211
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:43,390
who cares about how you feel care
about the objective kind of thing.

1212
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:46,900
And you told me that one time,
even two times I'd be like, cool,

1213
01:23:46,901 --> 01:23:51,850
that sounds dope man. I need to do
that. And then next week, next month,

1214
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:56,110
six months later. Do you
think that sticking with me,
maybe it resonated with me,

1215
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:58,130
maybe not, but no. Yeah,

1216
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:01,210
if you're saying it every week to the
point where it's like I don't even hear

1217
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:04,630
your words. I just know it as
the concept is just in there.

1218
01:24:05,050 --> 01:24:09,300
That's when like when I hear
people complaining that's
a big red flag violation

1219
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:12,670
just sticks out like a sore thumb
will receive someone blaming someone.

1220
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,070
That's the reason it sticks out because,

1221
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,400
so back to this idea of
having different seasons.

1222
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:22,830
If it was season one, people would,
the recommendation was there,

1223
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,380
go back and listen to them all again.

1224
01:24:24,381 --> 01:24:28,480
So you'd get reiterated on the
exact points. It's good in theory,

1225
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:32,270
but it doesn't work I think. I
don't know. That's a toughie.

1226
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:36,070
I don't know where to get a hundred
and then we do that season one.

1227
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:40,050
Season one is two straight
years of podcasts. Yeah,

1228
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:45,130
that could work because you know how cause
this is the concepts then we take one

1229
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:48,330
week off. No, we start season two week.

1230
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:55,900
I Dunno. Anyway, I have to, I like the
way you've been doing it to be honest.

1231
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:58,390
It's my input one guy.
This is my input.

1232
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,480
Well you do have 50% of the
vote here apparently. Oh,

1233
01:25:03,070 --> 01:25:07,870
all right. Well let's get these
questions. Yeah. Like I said,

1234
01:25:07,871 --> 01:25:11,950
these are quick questions. Yeah.
These are like, yeah, I like them. No.

1235
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:16,360
Okay. First question,
I'm going to read these,

1236
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:21,361
just how they're listed and then we'll
go swimming and or running for Bjj

1237
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:26,350
conditioning. Question Mark. Yes. Swimming
and running are good for conditioning.

1238
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:31,440
I would recommend that you use sprints
slash interval training for both and I

1239
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:35,590
think that's going to get you
where you want to be. Also.

1240
01:25:35,591 --> 01:25:39,790
It's good to have that good base cardio,
so that's good too.

1241
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:44,890
Uh, but yeah, they're both good.
The best conditioning for Jujitsu,

1242
01:25:44,980 --> 01:25:47,640
Jujitsu. Mm. The, the, the,

1243
01:25:47,641 --> 01:25:52,310
the shortfall of that is that
you can sometimes push you,

1244
01:25:52,370 --> 01:25:53,081
you've never mind.

1245
01:25:53,081 --> 01:25:57,910
Sometimes you can push yourself harder
in with burpees or with some kind of

1246
01:25:57,911 --> 01:26:00,790
metcon or, or swimming or running,
you know, he could do sprints,

1247
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,460
you should be breathing, you should
be able to make, breathe harder

1248
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,330
doing sprints.

1249
01:26:05,331 --> 01:26:10,160
Then you can doing the rounds
of Jujitsu for conditioning.

1250
01:26:10,380 --> 01:26:13,700
Yeah. Now the rounds of conditioning
in Jiu Jitsu are more important,

1251
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,650
but if you want to push herself extra
hard, you got to do something else.

1252
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:21,260
So swimming and running for
digits or conditioning guests,

1253
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:23,000
they're good use sprints.

1254
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:26,680
Yeah. And I agree. I've seen
as far as did you do that?

1255
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:30,830
I just learned this and I watched it. It
was on a Marcello Garcia video randomly.

1256
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:33,260
I don't know where he was like,
okay,

1257
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:37,670
I don't do any other external exercise
for conditioning, whatever. For Jujitsu.

1258
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:39,170
I used you do.
So that's conditioning,

1259
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:41,820
but I don't just do
regular did you to this is,

1260
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:46,570
I do in any demonstrated it and he was
going against a, he's obviously a high,

1261
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:48,170
high,
the highest level black belt.

1262
01:26:48,250 --> 01:26:53,180
So he grabs the guy and the guy is a
blue belt I think, and he's like, okay,

1263
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:55,400
this is how you do it for conditioning
is the goal. We're going to fight.

1264
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:59,420
We're going to roll for whatever, however
many, however many minutes they go.

1265
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:02,950
And he's like, boom, boom, boom. He's got
one move next. Boom. He's just going all,

1266
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:05,630
he's not even finishing moves. He's
going to the next one. Then he'll finish.

1267
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:08,030
Then they start again and he's going,
you could tell he's going hard.

1268
01:27:08,031 --> 01:27:12,470
He's essentially going as hard as
he would if he had only 30 seconds,

1269
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:16,730
45 seconds left on a high
level competence. That's how
hard and fast he's going.

1270
01:27:17,310 --> 01:27:21,140
And um, he was like, okay. And he
explains, you just, you're just,

1271
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:25,760
your focus is going from move to move as
fast and as hard as you can and you're

1272
01:27:25,761 --> 01:27:27,230
breathing and all this stuff.
And he goes,

1273
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:30,160
that's how you get conditioned with
Jujitsu. And I was like, Dang man, that's,

1274
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:32,900
that's good. Because think about it,
just like how you said when you hit,

1275
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:36,500
let's say you have six rounds to
go into regular Jujitsu training.

1276
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:37,950
Six it's so easy.

1277
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:42,710
You're just focusing on doing your
Jujitsu and with Jujitsu is energy

1278
01:27:42,711 --> 01:27:46,590
conservation, like all of these things
that are anti conditioning release.

1279
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:48,920
They are so you can, you
know, get into good spots.

1280
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:54,000
Let me show you one step even more
granularly. If you take six rounds,

1281
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:57,530
the last 30 seconds of each round it's,

1282
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:02,340
and I talked to Taylor and to Andy
about this and I said, hey guys,

1283
01:28:02,490 --> 01:28:06,870
when we get to the last 30 seconds, there
should be no cruising allowed at all.

1284
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:09,780
You should be going for the finish and
you should be going for the finish.

1285
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:12,420
Like if you've got 30 seconds left,
go for the finish.

1286
01:28:12,421 --> 01:28:14,790
If you've got 30 seconds after you're
in a bad position, go for the escape.

1287
01:28:14,791 --> 01:28:17,280
As hard as you can burn yourself out.
Yeah,

1288
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:22,430
that's a huge difference between
how you can just go into, I'm,

1289
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:25,710
I'm guilty as charged
because like you said,

1290
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,670
part of Jujitsu is energy conservation.
So for me,

1291
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:31,900
I'm really good at conserving energy.
Yeah.

1292
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:35,850
You can be cross side mounted on me
and you're, you're not going to make,

1293
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:40,140
and I know, I know. Yeah.
I'll be arrogant right now.

1294
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:44,850
If you mounted me or you've
got across the side on me and,

1295
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,600
and we had one minute left, you cannot
submit me. You know what I mean?

1296
01:28:48,601 --> 01:28:53,590
Like you cannot submit me. I'm really
good. I've had dean lister, you know,

1297
01:28:53,970 --> 01:28:58,740
mounted an onside control
for the last 22 years.

1298
01:28:58,900 --> 01:29:01,380
Yeah. Right. So I

1299
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,190
can defend myself. Well, so
if you have one minute now,

1300
01:29:05,191 --> 01:29:07,530
if I give you five minutes that that story
might be double. You have one minute.

1301
01:29:07,531 --> 01:29:08,460
That's how much time is left.

1302
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:11,970
So I can completely go into cruise
mode and that's the wrong answer.

1303
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,860
If you're going to try and get Neef,
you're,

1304
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,520
if you're trying to survive for some
reason, okay, well then yeah, utilize the,

1305
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:18,900
the conservation skills.

1306
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:21,870
But if you're trying to get some
conditioning work and prepare yourself for

1307
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:26,640
aggressive tournament style situations,

1308
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:30,060
you best put out and that's
why it kind of, in a way,

1309
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:33,000
going back to what you said about having
a coach is where the coach will be like,

1310
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:33,840
Hey,
shark tank,

1311
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:37,350
you don't know something like this where
they kind of avoid your capability or

1312
01:29:37,351 --> 01:29:38,220
they they,
yeah,

1313
01:29:38,221 --> 01:29:42,440
they avoid your capability to treat
Jujitsu as just regular Jujitsu and the

1314
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:45,000
energy conservation,
efficiency, all this stuff.

1315
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,950
You know that that's when
a lot of people ask me,

1316
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:51,300
what should I do for my first tournament
is in three days, what should I do?

1317
01:29:51,301 --> 01:29:55,560
What should, what should I look out for?
And what I tell people is that, okay,

1318
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,460
the person that you would go against
an a Jujitsu tournament is going to go

1319
01:29:59,461 --> 01:30:02,790
harder against you than anyone has
gone against you in the gym period.

1320
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:03,570
And the story,

1321
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:08,570
it is a whole nother
level of competition that,

1322
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:11,400
you know,
white belt versus white belt.

1323
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:14,190
The first time you go in a
tournament as a white belt,

1324
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:19,050
the person you're going on against is
going harder than anyone has gone against

1325
01:30:19,170 --> 01:30:21,810
you in the gym period. Yeah. You can't,

1326
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:25,320
even when we would have MMA
fighters fighting in the UFC,

1327
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:29,970
it's near impossible to get,

1328
01:30:30,330 --> 01:30:35,330
get to get the training partners
to go as hard against that guy as,

1329
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:40,320
as their opponent is going to
go. Yeah. It just, it does not,

1330
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:44,130
there's no legitimate fire.
Now occasionally, you know,

1331
01:30:44,131 --> 01:30:46,650
you get guys that are really good
training partners and they'll push you.

1332
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:51,540
But that's why we do shark tank. Yeah.
Because it's hard for me to get, you know,

1333
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:54,570
four guys lined up to roll with you and
everybody's going to go as hard as they

1334
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:57,990
possibly can. Yeah. Everyone's going
to match what you match a little bit.

1335
01:30:57,991 --> 01:31:00,650
They're going to use what they have
to use and that's so true, man.

1336
01:31:01,030 --> 01:31:04,230
I watch out for, there's a bunch
of those elements in there when,

1337
01:31:04,231 --> 01:31:06,900
when you're in a training scenario,
cause you don't have the,

1338
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:12,390
you don't have that background hum of
this means everything like a competition,

1339
01:31:12,391 --> 01:31:13,300
you know? So, yeah,

1340
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:17,030
I actually know who does go super hard
is people that have never trained Jujitsu

1341
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,080
for first time in the gym.
It's not a competition,

1342
01:31:19,081 --> 01:31:23,610
but that's the person feels
like a competition to them.
So true. So true. I mean,

1343
01:31:23,611 --> 01:31:28,611
I've been on the weird how crazy it is
that you just take a guy that completely

1344
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:32,940
believes that they can kick everyone's
ass if you bring them the Jujitsu gym and

1345
01:31:32,941 --> 01:31:36,110
they'd just get destroyed. Yeah.
Isn't that crazy? It's crazy.

1346
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:39,930
You just use a crazy thing.
It's an ego checker.

1347
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:43,140
That's kind of what else thinking.
And the same thing with kind of MMA.

1348
01:31:43,141 --> 01:31:46,890
I think Jujitsu and MMA, you know, kind
of the same deal where it's kind of real,

1349
01:31:46,891 --> 01:31:51,140
you know, um, where, you know,
you're talking about, you know,

1350
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:57,000
veterans come home and they come to
everyday life and you people have no idea

1351
01:31:57,060 --> 01:32:01,720
really what extreme stuff is,

1352
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,250
you know, and these
people aren't, you know,

1353
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:06,280
they're walking around just not knowing.
Meanwhile what they've been,

1354
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:08,620
what they've been through
is just so extreme.

1355
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,380
And they come back and they know
they have that basis for comparison.

1356
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:14,780
And you know, you get the steacher
who's like [inaudible], you know,

1357
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:17,050
mouthy and off to the guy I
remember and he goes, did it,

1358
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:19,840
didn't war teach you anything? All
kind of thing. And they don't know.

1359
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,510
They don't know nothing.
You know, give them one day,

1360
01:32:22,511 --> 01:32:26,770
give that teacher one day with, you
know, it's just a big eyeopener.

1361
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:30,850
So that's Kinda how I feel with
like Jujitsu and MMA and stuff.

1362
01:32:30,851 --> 01:32:33,330
And when you go out and when you hear
people talking, you know, like, oh,

1363
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:36,760
I just thought I kicked that guy's ass,
you know, kind of thing. And you're like,

1364
01:32:36,761 --> 01:32:40,600
oh my Gosh, God give you go
to the gym one day with two,

1365
01:32:40,601 --> 01:32:42,040
two rounds on a normal day,

1366
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:44,920
three rounds because one round
people think you got lucky.

1367
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:48,330
And I know that's the three rounds I
go, well that might've been locked, but,

1368
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:51,100
and then after you submit someone
three times, they're like, okay,

1369
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,470
that there's something I don't understand
here and I want to learn it and keep

1370
01:32:53,471 --> 01:32:57,160
them one 10 minute round, Oh
God. And watch them just be like,

1371
01:32:57,161 --> 01:33:01,390
this die can't do this. I
can't, like it's to the point,

1372
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:04,150
especially early on you get a
10 minute round and you know,

1373
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:05,800
cause when you're going
against someone there's,

1374
01:33:05,801 --> 01:33:10,030
that you're locked into a
normal person isn't going to,

1375
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:13,720
they're going to be destroyed after cause
they're going to be in a competition,

1376
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:16,310
white belt mode going as hard as they can.
Again,

1377
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:19,270
someone that's not using any strength or
energy at all who's destroying them and

1378
01:33:19,271 --> 01:33:24,240
submitting them every 30
seconds. Man. Jujitsu. All right.

1379
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,550
But yeah, the run it what I looked did
like about running like, you know, three,

1380
01:33:27,551 --> 01:33:32,350
four miles. Um, it, what I found
that that provided was um, you know,

1381
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:34,380
when you don't want,
we'll do take,

1382
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:36,790
take down battles and no
one's getting each other.

1383
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:40,720
I felt that it really kept me going,
like just being on your feet,

1384
01:33:40,721 --> 01:33:44,770
doing low intensity pushing
and I really felt that,

1385
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:48,910
that it helped that agree.
Check. Next question.

1386
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:54,420
What advice can you give on pushups
and bench press for shoulder and peck

1387
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:59,230
injuries. Slash. Recovery. Okay.

1388
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:01,600
Real quick for for all,
for all injuries.

1389
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:04,930
What I say is do what you can and do
what you can without hurting yourself.

1390
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:09,340
So for instance, if you can't do a full
pushup cause it hurts your shoulder,

1391
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,210
guess what?

1392
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:15,210
The whole do a quarter pushup and do a
bunch of them and just get that range of

1393
01:34:16,841 --> 01:34:19,210
motion. You're not going to get a full
workout, but to get that range of motion,

1394
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:19,781
get it working,

1395
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:24,781
and then maybe in a week you can do half
pushup and then you do half pushups and

1396
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:29,791
then another three weeks you can do a
three quarter pushup and then eventually

1397
01:34:30,191 --> 01:34:33,670
you can do a full pushup and then you
started doing your deep pushups in between

1398
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:36,100
rings or whatever and you you get it back.
That's what I do.

1399
01:34:36,101 --> 01:34:39,970
I do that with every body part that I
have that might be injured for whatever

1400
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:43,330
reason. I do what I can.
Yeah, I do what I can.

1401
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:46,000
And specifically I'll
tell you what bench press.

1402
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:51,390
I would use dumbbells and not barbell
because barbell locks your arm into

1403
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:56,821
position and this is very similar
to an Americana or a camera eat.

1404
01:34:57,220 --> 01:34:58,580
Both of those submission

1405
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:03,580
moves in Jujitsu are based on the same
kind of general range of motion as a

1406
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:05,030
bench press there.

1407
01:35:05,031 --> 01:35:08,000
There's definitely something
different about it and obviously it's,

1408
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,270
you can do bench press. I mean
people bench press, you know,

1409
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,870
hundreds and hundreds of pounds
on a barbell. So it can be done.

1410
01:35:14,871 --> 01:35:17,060
But essentially it is,

1411
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:21,320
is a similar motion if you're
like with an Americana,

1412
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,480
which is a submission hold in Jujitsu.

1413
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:29,120
If you can move where your wrist is, you
can, it doesn't hurt at all. You know,

1414
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:30,740
if you put your wrist up by your head,
it doesn't hurt.

1415
01:35:30,741 --> 01:35:32,630
All that can person can do in
America on all you all day.

1416
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,730
Once you bring it down
and now it's submits you.

1417
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:37,760
And that's the way I look at a barbell
and that's why I haven't done barbell

1418
01:35:37,761 --> 01:35:41,120
bench press and I don't even know how
long, especially like, uh, going for Max.

1419
01:35:41,121 --> 01:35:44,330
I haven't done that. I don't even
remember the last time I did it. But yeah,

1420
01:35:44,331 --> 01:35:48,220
for any of these injuries that you
might have, do what you can use minimum,

1421
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:52,760
you use the, use the range
of motion as you can. Don't
reinjure yourself, you know,

1422
01:35:52,761 --> 01:35:56,390
don't be, don't be stupid,
but if it hurts your knee,

1423
01:35:56,391 --> 01:36:01,250
when you get to a half a squad, do
a quarter squat or little, you know,

1424
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:05,650
do a, uh, a three eighths squad. Yeah.

1425
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:10,780
So that's what I recommend to
get through those. Yeah. And it,

1426
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,740
it's, um, that's kind of the
thing. And I know this from,

1427
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:19,570
and I had knee surgery and I had a
quick recovery, quick recovery. And

1428
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,360
the reason that was was because
a, you gotta be smart, just like,

1429
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:29,230
are you saying good to be smart
about your, don't I had knee surgery,

1430
01:36:29,231 --> 01:36:32,440
I'm not going to go max squat,
you know, four weeks later,

1431
01:36:32,500 --> 01:36:37,360
then it'll kind of thing. So yeah, you
take it slow, but at the same time you go,

1432
01:36:37,361 --> 01:36:41,770
you treat it like a workout.
Yeah, exactly. Right.

1433
01:36:41,771 --> 01:36:44,890
So Pete at some people was, I forget when
I saw, I don't know if I said on here,

1434
01:36:44,891 --> 01:36:49,570
but, um, where people would get
a shoulder injury for example,

1435
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:54,630
and part of the Rehab is like the
stabilization for your core and they'll be

1436
01:36:54,701 --> 01:36:55,330
like, oh, I'm not gonna,

1437
01:36:55,330 --> 01:36:59,440
I'm gonna skip that day because I
don't feel anything that's ab muscles.

1438
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,810
Why would I do that? I have a shoulder
injury, so I'm gonna skip that.

1439
01:37:01,811 --> 01:37:05,260
And you know, the next day I'll
do my little shoulder exercises,

1440
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:06,940
I'll go through the motions in.
That's it.

1441
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:10,150
But if you treat it like a for real
workout, like where you stretch it,

1442
01:37:10,151 --> 01:37:13,990
you kind of push yourself not in weight,
but you know,

1443
01:37:13,991 --> 01:37:16,720
you do do them all range of motion,
all that stuff.

1444
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:20,560
Every element of your rehab has
to be real important to you,

1445
01:37:21,130 --> 01:37:24,520
including the consistency.
And if you do it that way,

1446
01:37:24,670 --> 01:37:28,360
that'll be how don't to me,
and I don't know,

1447
01:37:28,361 --> 01:37:32,590
I don't know that the history of the,
this question or nothing but um,

1448
01:37:33,610 --> 01:37:38,440
bench press for shoulder injuries
and recovery. Not that they are, no.

1449
01:37:38,441 --> 01:37:41,500
Yeah, they don't, that's not a
hand in hand thing like, so if you,

1450
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:45,960
if you're concerned about whether you
know whether or not to get your bench back

1451
01:37:45,961 --> 01:37:48,880
up after you have a shoulder
injury. Okay. But they still,

1452
01:37:48,881 --> 01:37:51,580
the bench has nothing to do with
recovery from the shoulder injury,

1453
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:56,070
which you do is all the little
staves stabilization muscles in

1454
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,080
there, like these weird
motions and stuff like that.

1455
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:00,030
Because a lot of times that's where
it, you know, and it's another good,

1456
01:38:00,031 --> 01:38:04,310
another good compliment to, this is
why I had a shoulder injury and it,

1457
01:38:04,380 --> 01:38:07,560
it hurt really bad to do regular pushups,

1458
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:11,490
but I could do ring pushups because it
allows you to move away from those range

1459
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:15,540
immersions that hurt you. So that's
good. But yeah, bench press for shoulder,

1460
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,160
not good.
I had a guy,

1461
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,410
a new guy officer in Ramadi who had showed
up during deployment and he had a bad

1462
01:38:22,411 --> 01:38:25,880
shoulder for something and
he's like, Hey sir, I was,

1463
01:38:25,950 --> 01:38:29,910
I was wondering if you can me any good,
you know, exercises I could do for a,

1464
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,930
for my shoulder, which I have, you know,
a bad shoulder. And I was like, yeah,

1465
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:33,773
do muscle ups.

1466
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,520
And he kind of looked at me a little
strange and then later realized that I was

1467
01:38:40,621 --> 01:38:42,720
having fun. It ends in
jail. That's a joke.

1468
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:47,040
He luckily he didn't like heed my
advice at the time. He just thought,

1469
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:51,920
wow this guy is insane
so I can do rotators.

1470
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:53,220
Any rotator stuff like this,

1471
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:56,250
you know like throwing ball
motion just controlled in it.

1472
01:38:56,251 --> 01:39:00,630
That's been to get you back so you
can recover, you can recover from it.

1473
01:39:00,631 --> 01:39:01,200
And that's the thing.

1474
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:06,200
And again you just treat those rehab cause
there's nothing glamorous about this.

1475
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:10,010
That throwing motion exited like
a rotator cuff exercises helix.

1476
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,340
Exactly right.
I'm not doing that.

1477
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:16,560
I'm benching as the,
you know,

1478
01:39:16,561 --> 01:39:21,561
I'm doing some press deal but if you
do breast sarge like demonstrating.

1479
01:39:22,720 --> 01:39:25,370
So I had a kind of a shoulder like
from the day before and starts,

1480
01:39:25,371 --> 01:39:26,041
it was like Dang,
you know,

1481
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:30,210
sarge demonstrates kind of heavy handedly
and he ripped my shoulder and it,

1482
01:39:30,270 --> 01:39:34,140
I felt it pop out. So now I can't
lift anything above my head.

1483
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:38,820
So all I did was that rotator cuff.
It's like a program.

1484
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:41,250
It's like this way front
back and then down here,

1485
01:39:41,251 --> 01:39:46,140
this one anyway did that and it was only
for like two weeks and it was just bad.

1486
01:39:46,980 --> 01:39:49,200
Unfortunately sergeant
moved to Connecticut because
he's one of my favorite

1487
01:39:49,201 --> 01:39:50,380
training partners.
Yeah.

1488
01:39:50,460 --> 01:39:55,460
So he gives you an
accurate and when he gets,

1489
01:39:56,670 --> 01:40:00,030
when he's like his goto cause he
wrestled and he's got a sick double,

1490
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:03,390
he would just get in this double leg
mode and he'd get up or something.

1491
01:40:03,391 --> 01:40:06,420
Like we'd be scrambling, he'd get
up and I'd see the look on his face.

1492
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:07,950
Here it comes,

1493
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:13,610
here it comes and he blasts that
double that so hard launch me.

1494
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,400
I remember one time I rolled with him and,
and um,

1495
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:19,170
I think you may have like seen part of
it if something and you were like, oh,

1496
01:40:19,171 --> 01:40:20,550
how was it rolling? We
started, I was like, yeah,

1497
01:40:20,551 --> 01:40:23,460
you know how you kind of explain how the
role went or whatever. And I was like,

1498
01:40:23,461 --> 01:40:27,780
yeah man. And then he, he got, he turned
on this Modi, you were like, oh yeah,

1499
01:40:27,781 --> 01:40:32,640
he sergeant out on the funniest.
Did you ever see him do that?

1500
01:40:32,641 --> 01:40:36,600
A slingshot?
So he used to have this defense from uh,

1501
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:39,840
from getting triangled and he would
just, I, I can't really explain it,

1502
01:40:39,841 --> 01:40:44,841
but he would basically launch the
other human being across the mat.

1503
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,530
And it was awesome. Whenever I'd see
somebody to lock up and he didn't care,

1504
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:54,160
like they put a triangle
on him and he just, he'd go
into, he'd do the sling shot.

1505
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:57,220
You just laugh at it because he knows
he's getting ready to launch somebody.

1506
01:40:59,110 --> 01:41:01,840
So Chet got a school in Connecticut,
by the way,

1507
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:06,790
if you're in Connecticut you can go train
there. What is it? What's it called?

1508
01:41:06,791 --> 01:41:10,650
I didn't know that. It's called Jujitsu
life. That's what it's called. Okay,

1509
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:12,080
there you go.
Yeah,

1510
01:41:12,990 --> 01:41:17,990
one of my old teammates and one of my
longtime training partners to get some

1511
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:23,640
with next, next question.

1512
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:28,140
Do you prep your own food
daily or eat on the hook

1513
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,950
and grab what you can? I
do both. If I, if you know,

1514
01:41:33,220 --> 01:41:36,790
I generally don't pack up something
and make a little meal cause I'm my,

1515
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,010
my travels all weird and random.

1516
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:41,810
But
yeah.

1517
01:41:42,020 --> 01:41:46,090
So when I can I and, and I'm at
home so I make something up. Yeah.

1518
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:49,070
But I eat out a decent amount.
I got my go tos

1519
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:53,420
and I go eat there. Sometimes
they make good food for me. Yeah.

1520
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:59,090
If you're on the program,
like back in the treme. Yeah,

1521
01:41:59,091 --> 01:42:01,040
when I was at the seams
I bring lunch for sure.

1522
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:05,080
But it was never a lunch cause I never
ate lunch, never ate lunch, never. Never.

1523
01:42:05,210 --> 01:42:05,911
It was like,
okay guys,

1524
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:08,870
I'm going to go leave me alone for the
next hour cause I'm gonna go eat lunch.

1525
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:13,490
No, never ate lunch. Never. You'll
never see me saying, hey guys, okay,

1526
01:42:13,491 --> 01:42:16,310
let's call it for now and we'll go eat
lunch and we'll meet you back here in an

1527
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:20,780
hour. No, not have, you know, don't eat
lunch, work through lunch and stay late.

1528
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:23,020
And then so when do you eat then?
Just eat,

1529
01:42:24,740 --> 01:42:28,310
eat and be on the phone.
I can eat and be at the computer.

1530
01:42:28,311 --> 01:42:30,050
I can eat and you know,

1531
01:42:30,051 --> 01:42:34,010
unless we're doing something physical
and even then eat while you're doing

1532
01:42:34,011 --> 01:42:36,690
something physical, it's as long as
you're not reading on called met con

1533
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:39,291
you missed this one.

1534
01:42:39,291 --> 01:42:41,960
What would you recommend for striking
training as an effective real application

1535
01:42:41,961 --> 01:42:42,794
practice?

1536
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:45,860
Boxing. Muay Thai. Okay. That's real easy.

1537
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:48,110
Start with boxing because
it's easier to learn.

1538
01:42:48,111 --> 01:42:51,710
You don't have to throw big kicks, but
it's very effective martial art, boxing.

1539
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:56,940
And then once you get decent at
that u s Dow, you can go into Moy,

1540
01:42:56,941 --> 01:43:00,680
Tai and learn how to use your legs, your
elbows, your knees, your head. So they're,

1541
01:43:00,681 --> 01:43:05,000
yeah, agreed. The boxing
too, and this is strange,

1542
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:08,060
but it's absolutely true is if you,

1543
01:43:08,540 --> 01:43:12,140
if you don't have experienced throwing
punches and landing punches, it's,

1544
01:43:12,230 --> 01:43:17,230
it's surprisingly hard to punch
someone's face and landed at effectively.

1545
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:19,243
You know how like,
um,

1546
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:23,680
like on the movies, you know, you see him,

1547
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:25,330
he still watching macgyver a lot.
So guys,

1548
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:29,950
I used to punch people and
then he'd always shake his
hand like, oh yeah, like, oh,

1549
01:43:29,951 --> 01:43:32,550
I hurt my head every. That was
kind of one of the funniest thing.

1550
01:43:34,150 --> 01:43:37,060
It was funny. I'm sure I'm a guy,
we're there trying to make like,

1551
01:43:37,061 --> 01:43:40,840
oh MacGyver's such a softie in that way.
Such a those hardcore,

1552
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:45,790
he's hardcore like his brain. Like
he's super smart. He doesn't care.

1553
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:49,270
He had gone, you know he's not that guy
who has a paperclip. He has a brain. Yeah,

1554
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:52,400
exactly. Right. Paperclip, we
Harvard. I mean I have. Nonetheless.

1555
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:54,320
That's kind of what that was indicating,

1556
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:58,790
but I thought it taught kind of a
good lesson where if you, you know,

1557
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:02,570
you watch on TV guys, just punching
guys in the face and the head,

1558
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:06,860
but you can, if especially if you
don't have experience punching,

1559
01:44:06,861 --> 01:44:11,320
you can probably will break your hand
or hurt your hand. At the very least.

1560
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:16,370
If you go train boxing, even just once
a week, little some boxing or whatever,

1561
01:44:16,371 --> 01:44:19,550
you really get to learn like, okay,
if I'd start throwing these punches,

1562
01:44:19,610 --> 01:44:21,640
the difference, crazy. Jujitsu,

1563
01:44:21,650 --> 01:44:25,400
like six months of Jujitsu
destroys someone with no Jujitsu,

1564
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:29,600
six months of boxing does pretty damn
good against someone with no boxing for

1565
01:44:29,601 --> 01:44:34,400
sure. Yeah. Yeah. The only thing with
boxing and like striking, you can kind of,

1566
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,970
not really, I mean people are going
to get mad at even saying this,

1567
01:44:37,971 --> 01:44:39,620
but I don't mean this like
straight up literally.

1568
01:44:39,621 --> 01:44:43,610
But in the streets you can have
kind of some training, you know,

1569
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:47,270
like if you get an a bunch
of street fights all the
time and punch people in the

1570
01:44:47,271 --> 01:44:48,980
face, you learn. Yeah, exactly right.

1571
01:44:48,981 --> 01:44:53,930
You learn what you learn actually mostly
from being a legit street fighter is

1572
01:44:53,931 --> 01:44:57,750
you learn the mindset. Yeah. As stupid as
that sounds. But here's what you learn. I,

1573
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,890
if I punch this guy as fast as I can
before he's expecting it and I'm a soccer

1574
01:45:00,891 --> 01:45:04,160
punch, I'm, you'll become a good street
fighter. That's, that's what street is.

1575
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:06,580
Street fighting. A lot is
done on aggression, you know,

1576
01:45:06,590 --> 01:45:09,190
and if you get in my face and I
punch you in the face, you know,

1577
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:11,300
if you look at me and say, what's
your prompt? Boom. And I hit you.

1578
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:15,200
That's what I'll re like a good experience
street fighter that kicks a lot of

1579
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:18,560
people's asses. That's what they
do. They are over aggressive.

1580
01:45:18,561 --> 01:45:20,540
They don't care about getting in a fight,
they're not thinking about it.

1581
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:24,470
They're fighting. And so when you say,
Hey, what's your Prac? Right, right.

1582
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:27,680
Or the guy says, Hey, what do you look
crack? That's uh, that's what, uh,

1583
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:30,380
that's what a street fighter it is.
They're going to take action very quickly.

1584
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:34,610
That's so you can learn a lot from that.
So when you take that and someone,

1585
01:45:34,640 --> 01:45:36,770
you know, when someone shows up at the
MMA gym and they says, well, you know,

1586
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:39,160
I got a lot of street fights and if there,

1587
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:42,290
that's most of the time that's bullshit.
But if it's not,

1588
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:46,370
and they're actually a guy that's been
in a lot of fights and it's only so

1589
01:45:46,371 --> 01:45:49,240
helpful because now they've got someone
that they're going to shake hands or

1590
01:45:49,241 --> 01:45:51,680
with and then engage in combat.

1591
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:55,690
So they've lost the what and I'm not
saying it's a not a real thing. You know,

1592
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:59,420
some of my friends growing up were really
good street fighters and this is how

1593
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:03,590
I'm saying this with kind of a little
bit of knowledge is my friends that were

1594
01:46:03,591 --> 01:46:04,580
really good street fighters,

1595
01:46:04,850 --> 01:46:08,240
what was made them good street fighters
wasn't that they studied boxing wasn't

1596
01:46:08,241 --> 01:46:09,110
that they studied you did too.

1597
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:13,790
It was because they had a very aggressive
mindset and so someone would say, Hey,

1598
01:46:13,791 --> 01:46:16,730
what's your cracked? And they were
going ballistic. Right, right. You know,

1599
01:46:16,731 --> 01:46:20,090
or someone's, someone says, what
do you look at Prac and that's it.

1600
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,610
And it wasn't actually, it wasn't crack.
It was crack, crack, crack, crack, crack,

1601
01:46:22,611 --> 01:46:25,790
crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack,
crack, crack, runaway or, or you know,

1602
01:46:25,791 --> 01:46:29,120
that's so yes,
that's what a street fighter house.

1603
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:32,390
They have a mindset of the day.
I've been in fights before,

1604
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,520
but they know that the aggression
will take them a long way.

1605
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:39,680
It's kind of like a guy in let's
say basketball, who, you know,

1606
01:46:39,681 --> 01:46:43,200
he has a home court or something and
need to shoot a lot of shots. You know,

1607
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:45,620
like he knows he knows
how to make those shots.

1608
01:46:45,621 --> 01:46:47,390
But then now you put them
on the basketball court.

1609
01:46:47,391 --> 01:46:50,090
He has military training with
dribbling or McKeany things.

1610
01:46:50,090 --> 01:46:55,090
Yes. Yes. That is true. That is true.
You, you can learn the mechanics. Yeah,

1611
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:58,380
and then your own on your own.
You can learn the mechanics,

1612
01:46:58,381 --> 01:47:01,920
but the mechanics and then you could
end the mechanics are going to be almost

1613
01:47:01,921 --> 01:47:03,350
less helpful.
Yeah.

1614
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:06,690
That's what I'm going
actually understanding the
mindset of what's going to

1615
01:47:06,691 --> 01:47:09,450
happen in a fight. Now the mechanics
will be more helpful in basketball,

1616
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:12,900
but it's not.
Once you get in a real game.

1617
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:14,860
The first basketball game I ever played,
I had,

1618
01:47:14,890 --> 01:47:17,310
I knew the mechanics and I got destroyed.

1619
01:47:17,700 --> 01:47:20,280
Every past I threw for the
first 10 passes I threw,

1620
01:47:20,281 --> 01:47:22,800
got picked off and the guys going down
the other end of the court and scored.

1621
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:27,870
I'm not even kidding. That happened. My
Dad was like a Hoosiers kind kinda guide.

1622
01:47:27,871 --> 01:47:30,870
You see the movie Hoosiers exactly eight
you're going to work the mechanics.

1623
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:34,110
We're going to work. Paul handling, you're
going to work, passing, not shooting. No,

1624
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,800
no sparring or what is it
called? Scrimmaging. Right.

1625
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:40,260
You just got to learn the mechanics
and then that would have been cool if I

1626
01:47:40,261 --> 01:47:42,750
would have had a coach that
had a different mindset,
but the coach had the same.

1627
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:46,680
Who's your mindset is? My Dad, which
is mechanics, mechanics, mechanics.

1628
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:49,820
So I worked on all these mechanics.
I had really good ball handling,

1629
01:47:49,821 --> 01:47:52,170
a good passing,
and then I got,

1630
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:57,120
it was the first game I played in
basketball. I had never actually,

1631
01:47:57,121 --> 01:48:00,300
it was all maybe I done
a couple live games,

1632
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,220
but I had never played against anyone
skilled dribbled down the court May.

1633
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:07,020
I was a point guard dribble down the
court, held up my fingers about, okay,

1634
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:11,490
we're going to run play number three went
over to the side through the ball and

1635
01:48:11,491 --> 01:48:14,910
the dude just picked it off and the kid
that I was playing against was a really

1636
01:48:14,911 --> 01:48:17,760
good player. Then the other guy that
was guarding me, he just destroyed me.

1637
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:22,680
And the reason was didn't have
the experience of live games.

1638
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:26,880
Now I actually brought that mentality
when I was running training. I always,

1639
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:28,800
you know, you can sit there and
learn mechanics and the kill house.

1640
01:48:28,801 --> 01:48:32,370
So you can sit there and learn the
mechanics of doing immediate action drills

1641
01:48:32,371 --> 01:48:35,850
out in the field. The mechanics
are good. You have to know him,

1642
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:39,150
but you have to also be live.
And that's why I loved and when they,

1643
01:48:39,330 --> 01:48:40,111
when the seal teams,

1644
01:48:40,111 --> 01:48:45,060
when we went from just having
live rounds and paper targets,

1645
01:48:45,660 --> 01:48:49,260
which everyone was, that was
like the highest form. Hey,

1646
01:48:49,261 --> 01:48:52,560
we try and we train with live fire.
That's the best thing.

1647
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,300
And that's what I was raised to believe.

1648
01:48:54,510 --> 01:48:58,020
As soon as I saw we had simunition
and then once I realized how effective

1649
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,710
simunition journals, I was like,
you don't even need simulation.

1650
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:02,190
You can go run around literally
saying Bang, Bang at each other,

1651
01:49:02,191 --> 01:49:03,930
but you've got people moving
and it's going to help you.

1652
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:09,260
So that that mindset came from
trying to not be just be Hoosiers.

1653
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:13,650
You know Hoosiers that the movie
Hoosiers the basketball movie.

1654
01:49:13,651 --> 01:49:17,310
It's an awesome movie.
But the beginning is all just drilling.

1655
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:21,210
And my dad, cause I didn't
play basketball, I was a
dental and play basketball.

1656
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,640
He said, okay, so he's teaching me how
to play basketball. But he was like, Oh,

1657
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:24,360
who's your guy?

1658
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,670
You're going to be good defense are
going to be good at ball handling.

1659
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,250
And then unfortunately my
coach was the same way.

1660
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:32,670
My first coach was the same way. Seventh
grade or eighth grade, just like,

1661
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
hey Hoosiers, we'd have good defense.
And I dribbled down the court got,

1662
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:41,520
there'll be careful with that.
But someone that played street ball,

1663
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,280
someone that played street
ball. Yeah. And, and,

1664
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,600
and didn't no one ever taught in
ballhandling no one ever taught them that

1665
01:49:48,601 --> 01:49:50,920
theory behind a zone defense.

1666
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:51,893
Yeah.

1667
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:56,110
That guy would have done infinitely
better than I did in my first basket

1668
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:57,003
ballgame.

1669
01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:02,070
Yeah. My Dad must've been hanging
as well. Shame you must have been,

1670
01:50:02,071 --> 01:50:04,710
what a loser.
How did I raise this kid?

1671
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:09,030
Well it's the same. Same
kind of thing. Yeah.

1672
01:50:09,031 --> 01:50:13,200
Those street fighters, they know
how it feels to like land a punch.

1673
01:50:13,201 --> 01:50:16,290
They know they have this kind
of intuitive gauge on, you know,

1674
01:50:16,291 --> 01:50:19,280
kind of distance in a way. You know,
just cause they've been there. Yeah.

1675
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:22,080
And so that's why when you train people
for anything, even in the business world,

1676
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:26,700
like don't just train the
people the mechanics of of
a conversation that they're

1677
01:50:26,701 --> 01:50:28,920
supposed to have. If they're leader,
just don't train them on the mechanics.

1678
01:50:28,921 --> 01:50:32,310
Here's what you say. Read this script. No,
put them live. Fire them in there. Yeah.

1679
01:50:32,370 --> 01:50:34,110
What am live firing?
Just role play with them.

1680
01:50:34,111 --> 01:50:35,630
Having to sit with you while
you're going through something.

1681
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:38,520
Have him go in there and talk to somebody
that you told them how to act and act

1682
01:50:38,521 --> 01:50:39,930
all crazy. You do that. Do that with them.

1683
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:45,350
Yeah. Check, check. Do you take creatine?

1684
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:48,080
I do not tick routine.

1685
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:51,750
I have taken crew team. I believe it
isn't. It isn't effective supplement.

1686
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:55,440
When are you remember Fos Virginia?
When that came out,

1687
01:50:55,441 --> 01:50:56,820
that was the first Korean team supplement.

1688
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:58,920
I was drinking so much
that it was vanilla.

1689
01:50:58,950 --> 01:51:02,340
It was disgusting and I was on the,

1690
01:51:02,341 --> 01:51:05,310
I was on a ship at the time with a seal
platoon and we were all trying to get as

1691
01:51:05,311 --> 01:51:07,200
big as possible.
We are all taking creatine.

1692
01:51:07,201 --> 01:51:11,580
I was drinking so much fos for gain
that I had to hold my nose and do it,

1693
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:12,330
you know,

1694
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:16,890
hold my name is and do it like a shot
made me wanna throw up a weight gainer

1695
01:51:18,750 --> 01:51:21,180
gain. Yeah. Yeah.

1696
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:24,960
Well whichever one I was on foster for
gain and it was only a vanilla flavor,

1697
01:51:24,961 --> 01:51:29,510
which I don't even like vanilla flavor
that there, there is a mistake. No,

1698
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:32,130
that was all of the Alfred at the time
when it first came out because we were

1699
01:51:32,131 --> 01:51:36,150
all in the game. But yeah,
creatine is, it is effective.

1700
01:51:36,151 --> 01:51:38,540
I've never really had
any of those big, uh, uh,

1701
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:41,370
side effects where people say
you get dehydrated or whatever.

1702
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:43,620
Literally had that bloated.
I never really felt much of that,

1703
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:45,900
but I don't take routine right now.

1704
01:51:46,260 --> 01:51:50,420
Get it for a long time. Me Neither.
And I don't actually, I never did.

1705
01:51:51,290 --> 01:51:54,220
Maybe not.
I took this thing called Beta Gin.

1706
01:51:54,230 --> 01:51:55,830
I think there's create teeny in that.

1707
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:00,410
It was like long time ago
and he was too good, I think.

1708
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:03,370
I Dunno. But yeah, I don't
know much about it. Um,

1709
01:52:03,470 --> 01:52:06,560
as far as what's true and what's not
and I hear great things and I hear junk

1710
01:52:06,630 --> 01:52:09,900
things. Welcome to the Inter webs. Yeah.

1711
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:14,340
Next. Do you ever, it's a,

1712
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:18,380
you ever surf in Europe?
I have not served in Europe.

1713
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:19,850
I would like to start from Europe.

1714
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:23,900
I know that you boys up in
Ireland got some big slabs,

1715
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:27,200
so maybe at some point I'll get up
and surf up there. It looks awesome.

1716
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:31,070
It's very inconsistent though and
very crazy with the title differences.

1717
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:36,140
So at some point it would be cool.
He was surfing in Hawaii.

1718
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:41,570
I have, I have. Yes. You ever been
Nikolai before? No. All right.

1719
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:46,140
December. Think about
it. No question check.

1720
01:52:47,300 --> 01:52:50,690
I have a bad back and I need
to lose a hundred pounds.

1721
01:52:51,140 --> 01:52:54,920
Any advice on what exercises to
start with to kickstart things?

1722
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:55,531
You know,

1723
01:52:55,531 --> 01:52:58,500
you have a bad back and you need to take
care of that and I have no idea what

1724
01:52:58,501 --> 01:53:00,750
that means.
That could mean so many different things.

1725
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:04,680
What you need to do is you need
to probably fit you, you know,

1726
01:53:04,681 --> 01:53:05,910
started figuring out what you can do.

1727
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:10,500
You probably want to go see your doctor
and say, Hey, what can I can not,

1728
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:13,230
what can I do and what can I not do?

1729
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:18,300
And then doctors sometimes are overly
cautious, so maybe get a second opinion,

1730
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:19,051
see what can get away with.

1731
01:53:19,051 --> 01:53:21,390
But the bottom line is if you've
got a hundred pounds to lose,

1732
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:26,040
here's what you need to do.
Start moving some way somehow.

1733
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,870
Whether that starts off as walking,

1734
01:53:27,960 --> 01:53:30,240
where that starts off as
doing some calisthenics,

1735
01:53:30,241 --> 01:53:33,690
whether it starts off as riding an
exercise bike, you need to start moving.

1736
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:34,650
That's what you need to do.

1737
01:53:34,890 --> 01:53:38,310
And then you need to fix the Diet because
that's where most of that weight loss

1738
01:53:38,311 --> 01:53:42,600
is going to come from. And that's
the best ways to kickstart things.

1739
01:53:43,770 --> 01:53:44,170
Agree.

1740
01:53:44,170 --> 01:53:45,730
Yes.
And you know how

1741
01:53:47,350 --> 01:53:52,350
good the Diet thing real quick
that you don't like certain things.

1742
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:57,451
You go into certain situations and you're
hit with feelings or certain things

1743
01:53:57,941 --> 01:54:02,620
that you weren't expecting and
you're like, Dang, I reject feelings.

1744
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:07,090
But you know, then you'll
fall into certain pitfalls
because you're like, Dang,

1745
01:54:07,091 --> 01:54:09,640
I didn't really expect it to be like this.
You know?

1746
01:54:09,670 --> 01:54:13,780
And maybe if you went in there expecting
certain things or understanding that

1747
01:54:13,781 --> 01:54:17,830
certain things are going to come about,
you have more will. So the Diet thing,

1748
01:54:17,831 --> 01:54:19,480
when you change your diet,
if your diet,

1749
01:54:19,481 --> 01:54:24,010
let's say your typical diet is poor
mean typically that's going to mean it

1750
01:54:24,011 --> 01:54:27,870
tastes good in some way.
Whether it be you know,

1751
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:33,010
fast food or just whatever's chief.
Good. Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

1752
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:36,610
So it tastes good and food that tastes
good to have a certain chemical reaction

1753
01:54:36,611 --> 01:54:41,550
in your brain and they play,
they go hand in hand, pleasure,

1754
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:46,690
pleasure. So when you, um,
when you refine your diet,

1755
01:54:46,691 --> 01:54:50,830
typically that means it's going to be
less sugar. You know, sometimes less fat.

1756
01:54:50,831 --> 01:54:53,200
It depends on what kind of diet and
you know, you go on. But if it's,

1757
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:57,370
if it's a better diet compared to
your junk food diet based on taste and

1758
01:54:57,371 --> 01:55:02,320
pleasures, tasty, less tasty. Exactly
right. So it's one thing to be like, okay,

1759
01:55:02,321 --> 01:55:04,750
it doesn't taste as good and I
can handle that. That's cool.

1760
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:09,340
But the chemical reaction in your brain
is basically going to be telling you

1761
01:55:09,341 --> 01:55:10,660
like you need pleasure.

1762
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:13,310
You are being deprived of pleasure
and you're going to be like that.

1763
01:55:13,370 --> 01:55:15,650
No, they're telling you, your brain
is telling you it's not just pleasure,

1764
01:55:15,651 --> 01:55:20,030
it's sustenance. It's survival
exam, not just you want,

1765
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:22,440
I need that donut.
Yeah.

1766
01:55:22,441 --> 01:55:27,441
That was the standard and we got to get
rid of that and people call it cravings.

1767
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:30,480
That's your craving. But it's one
thing to be like, okay, craving.

1768
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:34,890
I can overcome that for a lot of
people. But it's, it's a weird feeling.

1769
01:55:34,891 --> 01:55:35,810
It goes beyond just that

1770
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:38,020
you want to know a good
way to kick things off.

1771
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:42,790
Go on a fast man going on a 24 hour
fast because I'll tell you what the best

1772
01:55:42,791 --> 01:55:46,380
thing about on a fast in my opinion,
is how it recalibrates your,

1773
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:48,540
your it recalibrates two things.

1774
01:55:48,541 --> 01:55:53,541
Your actual feeling of hunger and it
recalibrates your taste buds to yeah,

1775
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:56,700
because when you're eating this
beautiful stuff all the time

1776
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:03,420
and you just, it just need more of
it. Whereas once you go on a fast,

1777
01:56:03,480 --> 01:56:06,390
when you have a glass of water,
it tastes good.

1778
01:56:06,580 --> 01:56:08,610
Yacama stay so good when you,

1779
01:56:08,611 --> 01:56:13,080
and then when you break the fast and
you have whatever you're going to have,

1780
01:56:13,081 --> 01:56:14,820
whatever your first meal is,

1781
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:20,270
it takes really good and it's very
satisfying because you haven't eaten

1782
01:56:21,871 --> 01:56:24,150
anything. Yeah. Your
needs. Yeah, your needs.

1783
01:56:24,151 --> 01:56:28,560
So that's one of the best things I
found about fasting is that recalibrates

1784
01:56:28,561 --> 01:56:33,120
those, those two things, hunger and
taste and things start to taste better.

1785
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:38,340
It's like, have you ever, did
you drink coca cola? Right?

1786
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:42,960
So you're used to that sweet, sweet,
sweet thing every once in a while for me,

1787
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,350
because I don't drink it.
If I tasted it,

1788
01:56:46,351 --> 01:56:51,270
it tastes over the top
sweet over the top and be.

1789
01:56:51,271 --> 01:56:56,271
That's because I've fasted from having
Coca-Cola's for so long that it just is a

1790
01:56:56,641 --> 01:57:01,290
taste that I don't even like anymore.
But there's a middle ground where, hey,

1791
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:04,770
you can have, and you go, wow,
this tastes incredibly good,

1792
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:08,280
but I don't need a ton of it because
I got the satisfaction of the taste.

1793
01:57:08,650 --> 01:57:12,070
So yeah, that's another good way
to kick things off. Go on a fast,

1794
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:15,030
I want a 24 hour fast.
You don't need food.

1795
01:57:15,031 --> 01:57:18,150
Like I told him when my daughter was
going through her last wrestling season,

1796
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:20,710
she was telling me, she says, you
know dad, I was, I was thinking,

1797
01:57:20,711 --> 01:57:24,070
oh cause he's fasting or not fasting.
She's cutting. Wait, nevermind fast.

1798
01:57:24,071 --> 01:57:26,990
And she'd gotten weight and
her thing was like, you know,

1799
01:57:27,420 --> 01:57:31,590
if a person can live for 30 days
without food, I can make it til post.

1800
01:57:31,591 --> 01:57:35,460
Wayans yeah,
you're not starving.

1801
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:41,790
You're cutting weight as big.
Tony Btf Tony used to say like,

1802
01:57:41,791 --> 01:57:46,570
you're not going to die. Oh,
you're going to die. Oh No,

1803
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:49,590
no.
So calm.

1804
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:54,750
I talked to Tony the other day on the
phone. There was all fired up. We were,

1805
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:57,270
we were laughing really hard and die.
I was telling,

1806
01:57:57,630 --> 01:58:02,630
I was telling a story and he was laughing
so hysterically that it was hard to

1807
01:58:04,261 --> 01:58:09,030
understand. So yeah, Tony. Yeah.

1808
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:10,620
That was his thing. Well,
you're not going to,

1809
01:58:11,250 --> 01:58:15,030
you're not going to just die if
you don't have anything right now.

1810
01:58:15,480 --> 01:58:20,280
Just stops. He, man, that's, that's so
much about what you feel like eating.

1811
01:58:20,281 --> 01:58:24,990
Just picture Tony. Yeah. Just
picture BTF Tony sitting there going,

1812
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:30,320
you're not going to die if you don't have
that sort of the tall mu just this be

1813
01:58:30,511 --> 01:58:34,200
tougher, wrong with you. Man.
That's such a good, I mean,

1814
01:58:34,201 --> 01:58:35,790
it's real funny when he says it,
you know,

1815
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:39,450
it makes you feel like really the real
posts, but he's, he's kind of right.

1816
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:42,430
You know? It's like you're like, oh
my, I'm just, I've been just gravy,

1817
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:46,090
you know? Oh, what do you mean? How
embarrassing is that? Imagine this.

1818
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:51,180
Imagine if you had to announce your
stupid pathetic for cravings and needs,

1819
01:58:53,950 --> 01:58:56,290
wants to the world. Yeah. You know,

1820
01:58:56,410 --> 01:59:01,210
I imagine if I had to walk into a room
and do a group of people and say I cannot

1821
01:59:01,211 --> 01:59:04,150
live another second
longer without a donut,

1822
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:07,600
like that would be so embarrassing
as a human to say that.

1823
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:12,220
And yet we think that way and we
act that way. We don't say it right,

1824
01:59:12,250 --> 01:59:16,150
but our actions basically act that way.
We know that the doughnut is not needed.

1825
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,960
Yeah. We know that the doughnut
is not needed. If you were,

1826
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:24,460
if you were starving for for 38 days,

1827
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:29,480
eat a doughnut. If you are on day
37 hold off, you might find a steak.

1828
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:33,840
It's so bad, man. You see?

1829
01:59:33,860 --> 01:59:38,860
You mentioned that made me think that
it's so bad that this is an official

1830
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:45,670
effective way to like improve
your diet this way, dear.

1831
01:59:46,090 --> 01:59:50,170
Don't keep junk food in your house,
food,

1832
01:59:50,290 --> 01:59:51,101
junk food in your house.

1833
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:55,140
You can't control yourself and you can
rationalize to you, well, you know what?

1834
01:59:55,141 --> 01:59:56,800
This is no big deal.
I'm not going to start that.

1835
01:59:56,980 --> 01:59:59,680
I'm going to fast in three weeks anyways
so I might as well just to eat this

1836
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:02,980
whatever right now. That's how bad
we are. We can't control herself.

1837
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:03,731
I liked that idea.

1838
02:00:03,731 --> 02:00:07,510
I just thought of just having to announce
your week thoughts to the whole world

1839
02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:09,490
and how stupid they would like.

1840
02:00:09,491 --> 02:00:11,230
If you're going to carry
out an action that's weak,

1841
02:00:11,231 --> 02:00:13,600
you should have to verbalize it first.

1842
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:18,280
I am about to eat this doughnut because
I could not survive without it announced

1843
02:00:18,281 --> 02:00:20,370
your rationalization to the world.
Well,

1844
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:25,740
I'm going to skip this workout because
my left pinky is sore from Jujitsu three

1845
02:00:28,151 --> 02:00:32,410
weeks ago. Well, no. Well
that's just, that's the water,

1846
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:36,970
a rationalization. Then a lot of ones
that I've dealt with straight up,

1847
02:00:36,971 --> 02:00:40,770
I don't feel like it straight
up. That's not good. Come on.

1848
02:00:43,220 --> 02:00:47,870
Next question.
P D p e d or Hgh.

1849
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:52,630
Question Mark. Would that means, do you
take these or are in which one is better?

1850
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:57,730
Yeah. Well, PD is the general term
performance enhancing drugs and HGH is,

1851
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,110
oh,
human growth hormones.

1852
02:00:59,650 --> 02:01:03,130
I think he's asking or this
person is asking if you take him,

1853
02:01:03,370 --> 02:01:05,470
I cannot work or your thoughts on them.

1854
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:10,390
The only performance enhancing
drug that I take is chuck away.

1855
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:16,750
I take Jocko white tea now it's being
run through the Olympic Committee to see,

1856
02:01:16,751 --> 02:01:20,090
it looks like it's going to get banned
in the Olympics. Jocko white tea. Yeah.

1857
02:01:21,290 --> 02:01:25,030
Yeah. Tony had so many new records are
being broken. No, I don't take anything.

1858
02:01:25,031 --> 02:01:26,890
Never have the

1859
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:32,410
HGH and pds perform.

1860
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:35,740
What's the performance performance
enhancing drugs. Steroids, Bro. Yeah,

1861
02:01:35,770 --> 02:01:40,280
but so let's say
technically it's caffeine.

1862
02:01:40,281 --> 02:01:44,780
A performance. Yeah. I think
it actually, I dunno. I Dunno.

1863
02:01:45,560 --> 02:01:49,400
I Dunno it well it is. No, I do know
that it is a performance enhancing drug.

1864
02:01:49,430 --> 02:01:54,350
It is. And people take it when they
scientifically measure it is a performance

1865
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:56,450
enhancing drug.
But I think for some reason it's legal.

1866
02:01:57,300 --> 02:01:58,880
Even in the Olympics or whatever,
I don't think you,

1867
02:01:58,881 --> 02:02:00,650
I think you do have a
maximum that you can take.

1868
02:02:00,651 --> 02:02:03,680
I don't think you could just fill
your blood with caffeine and,

1869
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:06,410
and go do you know you're wrestling match,

1870
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:11,450
but kind of off. Yeah. Interesting.

1871
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:15,520
You have this friend
called Kate. Cool. Cool.

1872
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,880
Kilcoyne is his name in college. He was
like, I want to say outside linebacker.

1873
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:21,601
Maybe instead.
I don't know.

1874
02:02:21,601 --> 02:02:25,580
He's a linebacker slumps and so he'd
have a real good workout. And you know,

1875
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:29,100
when you work out lifting, you'd have,
you'd have a pump, right? You know,

1876
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:31,910
you walk around with him. So He'd take
off his shirt sometimes and he'd be like,

1877
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:34,220
look guys, guys, I think come on steroids.

1878
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:40,400
I always thought that was the funniest
thing. Nonetheless. Uh, yeah. No,

1879
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:44,690
no steroids or ped
Junko next,

1880
02:02:45,200 --> 02:02:47,540
please do believe in aliens.

1881
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:52,850
I'm assuming they mean extra
terrestrial aliens do mean that? Uh, I,

1882
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:58,210
my opinion on aliens is that I'm sure
in this vast unknown world and universe

1883
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:04,360
there is likely to be other life forms
that have some level of intelligence.

1884
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:11,360
Interesting. How, sure. I'm going to
scale from one to 10 how sure you are.

1885
02:03:11,390 --> 02:03:14,950
Obviously you can't be town very um,

1886
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:20,090
over a five but well I actually,
when you take the entire universe,

1887
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:23,300
which is so massive,
we can barely even comprehend it.

1888
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,780
The chances are decent
that there's some other,

1889
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:30,830
some how intelligent life
form out there and you almost,

1890
02:03:31,310 --> 02:03:34,370
I mean you kind of have to ask,
wait like at this very time,

1891
02:03:34,371 --> 02:03:37,580
but then when you think about it,
there's really no time in a way.

1892
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:41,780
Like that's kind of relative to so in
the whole existence would you say what

1893
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:45,770
nine are you level nine? Sure is the
nicest matter of opinion. Don't know.

1894
02:03:46,730 --> 02:03:51,110
I think, I think like 9.0 so you're
a believer? Yeah, I'm a believer.

1895
02:03:51,140 --> 02:03:54,950
I would be vast. Like if some
wizard guy was like, okay,

1896
02:03:55,220 --> 02:03:59,630
you get to make a bet. Do you think
there is or isn't? I know the answer.

1897
02:03:59,660 --> 02:04:01,760
You do think there is or isn't,

1898
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:06,860
you know the wizard be proof of concept
right there as you're talking to an what

1899
02:04:06,890 --> 02:04:11,410
if he was the guy from the future. Okay.
And somehow figured it out. I Dunno.

1900
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:14,090
They mapped the whole universe.
I don't know. Whatever.

1901
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:19,040
I would bet, oh, the cost is
your life too, by the way.

1902
02:04:19,370 --> 02:04:21,950
Like you got to have to make a bed.
You have to make a choice and you,

1903
02:04:21,951 --> 02:04:26,380
if you get it right, you live, you
get it wrong, you die. I would bit,

1904
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:31,330
yeah, I would bet. Yes I would. Yes. Yeah.

1905
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:34,850
That's the thing is is you would also,

1906
02:04:34,851 --> 02:04:38,280
it'd be interesting to have a
scientist or talk to a scientist

1907
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:41,820
about the probability of human life.

1908
02:04:41,821 --> 02:04:44,650
Like how credibly

1909
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:48,510
tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, minuscule,

1910
02:04:48,511 --> 02:04:52,100
like all the little things that had to
happen for us to end up here and it's

1911
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,950
good for them to have them
again. But then again, you, you,

1912
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:00,600
you compare that to the unknown.
One of this universe that is so large,

1913
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:04,110
it's been comprehensible.
Chances are it's happened somewhere else.

1914
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:08,220
And even in just, and that's in a way, a
different point where it's like, you know,

1915
02:05:08,221 --> 02:05:12,360
what would it take to,
to make humans and wind up being humans?

1916
02:05:15,060 --> 02:05:19,530
If you look at it backwards,
it seems really like,

1917
02:05:19,531 --> 02:05:23,730
oh my gosh, this is this
crazy, like, you know,

1918
02:05:23,910 --> 02:05:28,830
almost impossible odds. Yeah.
Miracle kind of thing. But you,

1919
02:05:29,100 --> 02:05:32,010
you can say that with every day thing.
If you look at it backwards. So like,

1920
02:05:32,011 --> 02:05:35,670
let's say I had, um, like
the Legos, right? Okay.

1921
02:05:35,671 --> 02:05:40,140
We had this big bucket of Legos. It was,
it was one of those big plastic tubs.

1922
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:43,620
It was just full of years and
years and years of Lego sets.

1923
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:44,700
And there's all in there,

1924
02:05:45,990 --> 02:05:50,990
if I were to take that to full legos and
fucking pour it out on the ground on a

1925
02:05:52,711 --> 02:05:56,640
marble surface. So they scatter
everywhere and then it'll, you know,

1926
02:05:56,641 --> 02:06:01,220
when they all settle, it'll be
a little pattern, right? Lego,

1927
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:05,940
various colors, shapes, sizes, all
kinds of different places, spaces.

1928
02:06:07,470 --> 02:06:12,120
And to take that exact pattern
down to the nano meter,

1929
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:15,270
that exact pattern,
and be like,

1930
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:20,300
this is the most special pattern in
the entire world ever in existence.

1931
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:25,770
This one is, there is no
way anyone ever, ever,

1932
02:06:25,771 --> 02:06:29,700
ever could recreate this exact pattern
down to the nano meter. It's impossible.

1933
02:06:30,060 --> 02:06:32,070
That's why this pattern is so special,

1934
02:06:32,370 --> 02:06:36,960
but it's just one of many
potential eventualities, infinite.

1935
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:39,780
You know, and when you end up
at something and then say, okay,

1936
02:06:39,781 --> 02:06:42,900
that what we have to
end up as his special,

1937
02:06:43,950 --> 02:06:47,640
that's looking at it backwards, like I
said, so it's like the lottery winner.

1938
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:52,050
You know the guy who wins the lottery,
he's like, oh my gosh, I'm so special.

1939
02:06:52,051 --> 02:06:53,370
I want to let know fricking.

1940
02:06:53,490 --> 02:06:58,490
If I took a ping pong ball and I saw and
I had a mosh pit of 1 million people,

1941
02:06:58,830 --> 02:07:03,000
one ping pong ball, I throw it in the
mosh pit and then somebody catches it.

1942
02:07:03,010 --> 02:07:05,550
Oh my gosh, I'm so special.
Breast, someone's going to get it.

1943
02:07:05,790 --> 02:07:09,720
Someone's going to get the ping
pong ball. That's affirmative. Yeah.

1944
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,560
So it doesn't make it necessarily
special unless you look at it backwards.

1945
02:07:13,590 --> 02:07:16,050
You know, if that guy's like, I'm
going to go into another lunch,

1946
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:20,640
another during the other alien life form
could be something that we could barely

1947
02:07:20,641 --> 02:07:23,040
even imagine of what it's
like and that's that.

1948
02:07:23,160 --> 02:07:27,900
That probability wise is what it is. Or
it's going to be something like so small.

1949
02:07:28,620 --> 02:07:32,220
But if it's like more a
superior intelligence is
going to be something we don't

1950
02:07:32,221 --> 02:07:33,090
recognize the same way.

1951
02:07:33,090 --> 02:07:38,090
Like if you have a caterpillar on the
leaf and I see it from 10 yards away,

1952
02:07:38,201 --> 02:07:40,360
all I see that little cat
caterpillar rate right there.

1953
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:41,650
Hey Caterpillar yelling at it.

1954
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:44,170
You know the vibration from
my voice are hitting it.

1955
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:45,790
It get up out of the Caterpillar.

1956
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:47,890
The Caterpillar has no
idea that you even exist.

1957
02:07:47,891 --> 02:07:50,320
Doesn't even know what a human is,
doesn't know about your problems.

1958
02:07:50,470 --> 02:07:53,290
It doesn't know about your
podcast. You know? Meanwhile,

1959
02:07:53,291 --> 02:07:54,620
you know a lot about your podcasts.

1960
02:07:55,300 --> 02:07:59,760
Listen to the podcast and I can say
with a fair amount of stuff. Then again,

1961
02:07:59,770 --> 02:08:00,970
I don't know, maybe he does. I don't know.

1962
02:08:00,971 --> 02:08:04,540
He has a big butterfly
plans for his future.

1963
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:09,610
Jocko. Next question. Next question.

1964
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:12,740
How can I encourage bro?
We can talk

1965
02:08:13,210 --> 02:08:15,880
more about the aliens,
aliens or Legos.

1966
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:19,630
I'm telling you mego patterns because you
know when people see you at full. Yeah,

1967
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:23,350
they go straight teeth. That's an
alien. Even though it's an unidentified,

1968
02:08:23,570 --> 02:08:27,280
can't do that. Remember what I was telling
you? That kid's book idea. Yeah, you did.

1969
02:08:27,281 --> 02:08:29,020
Tell me about that.
You don't have to tell me again either.

1970
02:08:29,021 --> 02:08:32,710
It goes deeper on that telling you,
telling her it's actually,

1971
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:37,510
it's more about the flaws of how
people consider or regard aliens,

1972
02:08:37,600 --> 02:08:40,120
potentially elites.
Jocko,

1973
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:43,450
how can I encourage a sense of urgency?

1974
02:08:43,980 --> 02:08:47,390
This is a hard one and
others? Well, yeah, I think,

1975
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:51,780
I'm assuming that this means with others,
but for either yourself or others,

1976
02:08:51,781 --> 02:08:54,630
which you have to realize is that is
going by very fast and when you have

1977
02:08:54,631 --> 02:08:58,170
projects that are, do you, the minute
you look at them, you got to say,

1978
02:08:58,200 --> 02:09:00,030
this is going to take longer
than we think it's going to take.

1979
02:09:00,240 --> 02:09:05,240
Let's start moving on it now and then
set yourself a really tight timelines to

1980
02:09:06,181 --> 02:09:09,660
make things happen and that what that'll
do is it'll make you realize how far

1981
02:09:09,661 --> 02:09:11,370
behind the power curve you are.
That was a,

1982
02:09:11,371 --> 02:09:15,960
one of my rules when I was in the seal
teams was I was always saying let's be as

1983
02:09:15,961 --> 02:09:19,980
far ahead of the power curve as
power as possible as we possibly can.

1984
02:09:20,250 --> 02:09:22,590
So is that a normal
expression power curve?

1985
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:24,870
Like that's the thing that you're trying
to stay ahead of cause it's going to

1986
02:09:24,871 --> 02:09:27,450
smash you. So I would
always, you know, just,

1987
02:09:27,451 --> 02:09:30,780
we didn't slow down the power curve
if we got, we thought we were ahead,

1988
02:09:30,810 --> 02:09:31,650
go ahead further.

1989
02:09:32,130 --> 02:09:37,050
But I always had a really good sense that
that PowerCurve was coming to crush us.

1990
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:41,640
So that's what you have to do.
Get as far ahead as of it as you can.

1991
02:09:41,760 --> 02:09:44,700
Tell everyone where it is or
set some small goals. Say, Oh,

1992
02:09:44,701 --> 02:09:46,920
you don't think this is gonna this
project's going to take long. Okay, cool.

1993
02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:50,250
Let's just finish this first 6%
which means this, this, and this,

1994
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,020
and let's have that done
by tomorrow afternoon.

1995
02:09:52,650 --> 02:09:55,470
Tomorrow afternoon comes in and they're
not even close. Okay. Guess what?

1996
02:09:55,590 --> 02:09:56,610
We need to align.

1997
02:09:56,611 --> 02:09:58,690
We need to get a sense of urgency
going so we can get this done, done.

1998
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:00,273
That's it.

1999
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:07,420
I know that to encourage a
sense of urgency in yourself.

2000
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:13,020
What you can do kind of works sometimes
is you think about the feeling you're

2001
02:10:13,331 --> 02:10:17,170
going to have after it's done and then
consider things that you already did get

2002
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:21,370
done. You're have those, well,
you're different, but sometimes we,

2003
02:10:21,550 --> 02:10:26,170
the people have things that man,
we need to do and it's just a small thing,

2004
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:30,340
you know, and you're like, Hey,
I'll do it. I'll do it later.

2005
02:10:30,341 --> 02:10:34,040
I'm doing something right now. Do
it. You know, tomorrow. Yeah, sure.

2006
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:37,620
That's pretty intuitive to you.
But you know, sometimes you do.

2007
02:10:37,621 --> 02:10:39,230
You'd just be like doing it later.

2008
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:42,410
I'm just going to do it later because
I'm thinking about something right now or

2009
02:10:42,411 --> 02:10:44,450
I'm doing something right now and then,

2010
02:10:45,070 --> 02:10:48,110
or while you're thinking about doing it,
but just do it.

2011
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:53,120
I know with your kids all the time,
Hey, do the dishes, blah, blah,

2012
02:10:53,121 --> 02:10:56,120
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. You'd already be done. I know.

2013
02:10:56,121 --> 02:10:59,030
That's the thing. That's the whole
point right there. So when you do it,

2014
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,340
when you do the thing, let's say
you've got to, I don't know, whatever,

2015
02:11:01,370 --> 02:11:03,530
you had to respond to an email,
I don't know.

2016
02:11:04,300 --> 02:11:07,970
And after you do it that just that
feeling right when it's done, you're like,

2017
02:11:07,971 --> 02:11:11,030
Dang, not that. Hey, that
wasn't, didn't take much a,

2018
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:15,080
that's not gonna be a case every time,
but didn't take much. And B, I'm done.

2019
02:11:15,800 --> 02:11:20,360
My Dad and he said this saying, this is
what he'd say, do it and it'll be done.

2020
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:24,410
It's a good thing. And as a kid I was
like, hope you're a drizzle. Smart.

2021
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:27,500
That's like it is what it is. Yeah, I
know. It is what it is. You said that,

2022
02:11:27,501 --> 02:11:30,890
you don't have to say that, you know,
but what's Your Dad's first name?

2023
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:35,350
Technically it's William
Charles Jr. Okay. Easy.

2024
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:40,700
Those were BC. We have a new quote from
BC. I see. Oh, for Bill Charles. Charles.

2025
02:11:40,710 --> 02:11:44,240
Yeah. So bcs in the house, you
know, do it and it is done.

2026
02:11:44,870 --> 02:11:47,960
I like that one through it and then it
will be done, do it and it will be done.

2027
02:11:48,190 --> 02:11:51,690
Yeah, I changed it a little bit. Do it
and it's done. Yeah. Same thing to say my,

2028
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:55,340
but his thing was always, yeah, exactly
the same thing or the exact words.

2029
02:11:55,360 --> 02:12:00,110
BC do it and it'll be done.
Yeah. At me as a grown adult,

2030
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:05,210
arguably you apparently didn't
impact the way you wanted them.

2031
02:12:05,211 --> 02:12:07,660
Now I'm seeing the genius
of it, you know, do an,

2032
02:12:07,710 --> 02:12:12,260
it'll be done like you don't
have to. So good. Next question.

2033
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:14,480
If do do too,
it's not locally available.

2034
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:19,780
What would be the next best martial
arts choice or the next best thing?

2035
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:24,110
Or is the one way 70 mile drive worth it.
Thank you.

2036
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:26,810
Meaning it's not locally available.
It's seven

2037
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:29,880
miles away. That's a long haul. So yeah,

2038
02:12:29,910 --> 02:12:33,090
there's a lot of other available
martial arts, I would say.

2039
02:12:33,091 --> 02:12:36,150
You got judo and wrestling and those
exists in a lot of places that Jujitsu

2040
02:12:36,151 --> 02:12:40,320
doesn't exist. So wrestling, judo, sambo,

2041
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:44,850
those are all good options. Great options.
You can find a catch wrestling school.

2042
02:12:44,940 --> 02:12:47,400
There's, so there's definitely some
options to find a good grappling,

2043
02:12:47,401 --> 02:12:48,990
but a real grappling school,

2044
02:12:49,080 --> 02:12:54,080
what you want to watch out for is
a place that says it has karate,

2045
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:57,090
Kung Fu end Jujitsu.

2046
02:12:57,360 --> 02:13:00,060
You want to watch out for
that place because that means
the guy just put that up

2047
02:13:00,061 --> 02:13:03,240
there because you just is getting popular.
So watch out for that guy.

2048
02:13:03,350 --> 02:13:07,190
And that one's pretty like
across the board right there.

2049
02:13:07,310 --> 02:13:11,570
I mean I can't really imagine many
exceptions where it's like Gra, you know,

2050
02:13:11,571 --> 02:13:14,440
like all the other ones and
Jujitsu and it's a legitimate,

2051
02:13:14,860 --> 02:13:18,260
it doesn't happen very often. Now you
might have a place that says boxing,

2052
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:20,230
wrestling or Jujitsu. Yes, yes,

2053
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:24,090
probably legit because you've got
legit boxing, legit wrestling,

2054
02:13:24,420 --> 02:13:29,100
legit judo and legit Jujitsu. So you go,
okay, that's cool. That's probably true.

2055
02:13:29,370 --> 02:13:33,960
But when it's non things I,
they throw Jujitsu on the end of it.

2056
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:37,830
Watch out.
And whenever I'm talking about Jujitsu,

2057
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:40,560
I'm talking about Brazilian Jujitsu.
I've just got to make that clear.

2058
02:13:40,570 --> 02:13:43,680
Talking about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,
not other forms of Jujitsu.

2059
02:13:44,940 --> 02:13:46,020
So be careful of that

2060
02:13:47,730 --> 02:13:52,290
in the spirit of fairness there, there
very well could be like, you know,

2061
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:53,460
cause a lot of these guys,
they'll,

2062
02:13:53,490 --> 02:13:56,940
they'll have this vast
background in like Kempo karate.

2063
02:13:57,030 --> 02:14:01,920
You're got taken care of from other site
and then they get to know for sure he

2064
02:14:01,921 --> 02:14:05,430
knew I was at their traditional
lands but they're Jujitsu legit.

2065
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:08,820
That's why I said just be careful,
just be careful with my battery.

2066
02:14:09,150 --> 02:14:10,170
And most people,

2067
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:15,120
if 15 years ago they started taking
Brazilian Jujitsu and they got their black

2068
02:14:15,121 --> 02:14:19,730
belt there,
their Tai Chi Quan,

2069
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:23,520
uh, whatever, whatever.

2070
02:14:23,910 --> 02:14:27,450
Martial art is not at the, on the list
of what they teach at their school.

2071
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:30,220
It's gone. Actually the, if
they're a black belt in Jujitsu,

2072
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:35,270
they're teaching Brazilian Jujitsu and
they don't say Brazilian Jujitsu plus

2073
02:14:36,730 --> 02:14:40,950
Baucom Quan or whatever. They don't
say that they're going to do that.

2074
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:44,310
And if they do do it,
I actually am going to question,

2075
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:49,950
there are some questions. There's
questions again, can it be,

2076
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:54,300
can there be a legit person? Yes there
can. There are some legit dudes that are,

2077
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:54,751
you know,

2078
02:14:54,751 --> 02:14:58,410
black belts in Brazilian Jujitsu and
there are a black belt in some other

2079
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,350
traditional martial art that
they took before that that is,

2080
02:15:01,380 --> 02:15:06,380
that does happen most of the time when
they realized that the white belt or blue

2081
02:15:06,931 --> 02:15:10,380
belt in Brazilian jujitsu destroyed
them and their martial arts,

2082
02:15:10,420 --> 02:15:12,750
they'd studied for 10 years.
They don't put that on the list anymore.

2083
02:15:13,500 --> 02:15:16,980
That's why I,
that's what it does to most people.

2084
02:15:17,490 --> 02:15:22,260
So that's why there's questions,
questions, there's questions. So yeah,

2085
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:26,220
if the wrestling wrestling what, well
I know I'm missing it. I apologize.

2086
02:15:26,221 --> 02:15:30,180
Got Folks out there if I'm
missing. But wrestling, judo,

2087
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:35,100
sambo,
catch wrestling those.

2088
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:40,390
Now if there's no kind of grappling
then you boxing Muay Thai you,

2089
02:15:41,611 --> 02:15:43,980
that's your next best option so that
you're still learning how to fight.

2090
02:15:43,981 --> 02:15:46,460
You just aren't getting the groundwork
and you definitely want to get the ground

2091
02:15:46,461 --> 02:15:50,700
work at some point. So, and then
the question on the 17 mile drive,

2092
02:15:50,701 --> 02:15:52,170
I get this a lot to some people,

2093
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:55,560
they have no martial art in
their area and they have a marsh,

2094
02:15:55,590 --> 02:15:58,350
they have Jujitsu 70 miles away.
What should I do?

2095
02:15:58,530 --> 02:16:02,340
My vote in that situation is it
get some maths at your house,

2096
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:04,590
get two or three of your friends.
I want to learn how to fight,

2097
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:09,690
start watching youtube videos and once
a week on the Saturday go down to that

2098
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:14,310
Jujitsu school. When we were
training back at Fabio's, there was,

2099
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:18,080
there was people like that they lived in,
they lived somewhere in,

2100
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:22,560
in the desert of southern California.
There was no Jujitsu.

2101
02:16:22,770 --> 02:16:27,180
They work nine to five and
then on Saturday they'd come
out and train and that's

2102
02:16:27,181 --> 02:16:27,751
what they got.

2103
02:16:27,751 --> 02:16:30,670
And they go home and work on their drills
with their three guys that they were

2104
02:16:30,671 --> 02:16:33,940
driving 80 miles to come and train
on the weekends. So yeah, that's,

2105
02:16:33,941 --> 02:16:36,190
that's a method of doing it to you.

2106
02:16:36,580 --> 02:16:40,240
You can train on your own with your
buddies on the maths that you get and

2107
02:16:40,241 --> 02:16:43,060
watching youtube and or whatever

2108
02:16:44,330 --> 02:16:46,280
online mechanism you want to use.

2109
02:16:46,880 --> 02:16:51,050
And then once a week you come and you
make the trek and you learn and you get to

2110
02:16:51,051 --> 02:16:54,680
train with other people and you see where
you're at. Yeah. Dang. That's good. Yeah.

2111
02:16:54,710 --> 02:16:58,520
Very good. Yeah. The next
best thing is the heart.

2112
02:16:58,580 --> 02:17:03,110
I guess it's some total matter of opinion,
but I feel like wrestling,

2113
02:17:03,170 --> 02:17:05,520
like if you went, um, okay.

2114
02:17:06,020 --> 02:17:09,250
Like while wrestling is
like a really good tool.

2115
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:11,600
It depends on what you're doing.
Yeah.

2116
02:17:11,700 --> 02:17:14,100
Like why, why you're doing it. Yeah. Yeah.

2117
02:17:14,160 --> 02:17:17,580
Like for self to wrestling is awesome.
Yeah.

2118
02:17:17,670 --> 02:17:21,390
I know that that's awesome.
Wrestling is,

2119
02:17:21,391 --> 02:17:26,390
gives you such a massive advantage,
not only in Jujitsu but in life. Yeah.

2120
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:29,400
It gives you an advantage.
So wrestling is awesome.

2121
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:34,980
That being said,
judo is awesome too,

2122
02:17:35,180 --> 02:17:39,960
and if you train, but there's more of
a variation in judo schools, right?

2123
02:17:40,040 --> 02:17:42,090
Yeah.
And a high end judo school,

2124
02:17:42,091 --> 02:17:46,470
those people are awesome and
that's a great martial art.

2125
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:50,850
And you've learned groundwork. You learned
take downs. It's a great martial art,

2126
02:17:51,150 --> 02:17:53,070
don't they?
I would no question about it.

2127
02:17:54,570 --> 02:17:59,430
There are some weak judo schools though.
Judo has a little bit of a tendency to,

2128
02:18:00,030 --> 02:18:04,110
sometimes judo people can adapt
some of the traditional marts,

2129
02:18:04,350 --> 02:18:09,330
traditional martial arts attitude,
including the attitude of,

2130
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:14,250
of we're not actually training.
And so that has happened,
but that's, that's less.

2131
02:18:14,940 --> 02:18:17,510
That doesn't happen very often. So
yeah, if you can find a good judo,

2132
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:21,330
the way you find, if it's a good judo
school going put on a g and and say,

2133
02:18:21,331 --> 02:18:24,440
let's fight or let, let me train with
you and they're going to put you,

2134
02:18:24,630 --> 02:18:27,570
they're gonna, they're gonna take you
down and be able to work you over.

2135
02:18:27,630 --> 02:18:31,740
That's what judo is. Judo is very similar
to Jujitsu, very similar to Jujitsu.

2136
02:18:33,090 --> 02:18:36,660
So Judah is a great thing to
have. Wrestling is a great
thing to have for sure.

2137
02:18:36,690 --> 02:18:37,770
Sambos awesome.

2138
02:18:38,640 --> 02:18:42,390
Sambo is actually like judo
and wrestling together,

2139
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:47,400
so sambos great. Same with catch
wrestling. Again, there's catch.

2140
02:18:47,401 --> 02:18:50,820
Wrestling is a little less with
catch wrestling, you're, you're,

2141
02:18:50,821 --> 02:18:53,670
you're a little bit more apt to find
somebody that doesn't actually know what

2142
02:18:53,671 --> 02:18:57,330
they're doing.
And so you have to be careful of that.

2143
02:18:57,450 --> 02:19:01,700
There's some phenomenal catch wrestling
schools though, for sure. Yeah. So

2144
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:04,203
that's true.

2145
02:19:07,070 --> 02:19:11,220
I think we've got time to look
at one more of these. Yes, Jocko.

2146
02:19:12,690 --> 02:19:15,420
How do we get the desire
to have discipline?

2147
02:19:17,220 --> 02:19:18,300
How do I

2148
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:23,440
get the desire to have discipline?

2149
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,010
I keep

2150
02:19:28,010 --> 02:19:30,440
getting asked this type of question.

2151
02:19:30,441 --> 02:19:34,820
How do I get disciplined or how do I
want discipline or how do I maintain

2152
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:39,770
discipline? And the answer,
it's, it's a simple answer,

2153
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:43,400
but obviously it's not easy.

2154
02:19:44,240 --> 02:19:48,290
And there's all all kinds of little
tricks and methods that people talk about

2155
02:19:49,640 --> 02:19:53,780
and you know, they have
some merit, you know,

2156
02:19:53,781 --> 02:19:56,480
maybe they do work these,
these things, you know,

2157
02:19:56,481 --> 02:19:59,630
do the little things people say and,
and wake up early.

2158
02:19:59,631 --> 02:20:04,631
I say that and write things down and
take cold showers and tell everyone what

2159
02:20:07,101 --> 02:20:11,810
you're going to do.
So broadcast it and make promises or,

2160
02:20:11,811 --> 02:20:16,790
or make bets with, with your friends. Have
something that you don't want to lose.

2161
02:20:17,180 --> 02:20:20,720
And those things, those
ideas, they're cool.

2162
02:20:20,721 --> 02:20:25,330
I'm sure they're going to have some
impact and if they work for you, that's,

2163
02:20:25,390 --> 02:20:28,400
that's awesome.
But,

2164
02:20:28,440 --> 02:20:33,440
but the fact of the matter is that the
reason discipline is hard to maintain is

2165
02:20:34,351 --> 02:20:36,450
because it is hard to maintain.

2166
02:20:38,950 --> 02:20:42,190
That's what makes discipline hard.
It's hard.

2167
02:20:44,030 --> 02:20:49,030
And if you hear me claim that
discipline is easy for me,

2168
02:20:52,100 --> 02:20:55,490
then straight up,
that's just my ego talking.

2169
02:20:56,210 --> 02:21:00,470
That's what that is because
I'm

2170
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:07,000
unfortunately just as human as everyone
else and it is a work to maintain the

2171
02:21:08,661 --> 02:21:13,490
discipline. That's what it
is. Work holding the line,

2172
02:21:14,930 --> 02:21:17,660
maintaining the standard,

2173
02:21:19,070 --> 02:21:22,760
giving no slack, none.
That's the discipline,

2174
02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:28,090
that's the discipline and it is hard.

2175
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:34,990
And if there's one thing I would
say that does make it easier,

2176
02:21:36,310 --> 02:21:40,870
it's to envision what it
feels like when you're done,

2177
02:21:42,370 --> 02:21:47,370
what it feels like after you've worked
out or you've held the line on your food

2178
02:21:49,181 --> 02:21:54,181
intake or you've pushed through some
monotonous project that you have to do in

2179
02:21:56,771 --> 02:22:01,370
all those things. When they're
doing that, they feel good

2180
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:08,530
and
contrary to that invasion,

2181
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:13,590
what you will feel like later
when you let the discipline slack,

2182
02:22:15,110 --> 02:22:16,060
you know the feeling,

2183
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:23,520
feeling weak and deed and you
know that you're falling behind.

2184
02:22:28,520 --> 02:22:33,520
So get to know those two different types
of feelings and ask yourself which one

2185
02:22:35,451 --> 02:22:37,100
you want to feel in 10 minutes

2186
02:22:38,670 --> 02:22:40,560
or in a half an hour

2187
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:44,940
when when the thing is done,

2188
02:22:45,090 --> 02:22:48,390
when the discipline has blend implemented,

2189
02:22:51,940 --> 02:22:56,940
remember what that feels like and then
remember that those minutes and those

2190
02:22:57,700 --> 02:23:02,700
hours they turn into weeks and
months and years and holding villein.

2191
02:23:03,101 --> 02:23:08,101
In those critical minutes we'll put you
in an infinitely better place physically

2192
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:14,350
and mentally if you
maintain the discipline.

2193
02:23:17,860 --> 02:23:20,920
So work through the weakness,

2194
02:23:20,980 --> 02:23:25,000
fight through the temptation,
hold the line,

2195
02:23:27,060 --> 02:23:30,960
hold the line,
maintain the discipline.

2196
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:33,180
It is not easy,

2197
02:23:36,170 --> 02:23:37,580
but it is worth it

2198
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:41,820
because

2199
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:44,593
yes,

2200
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:49,490
because discipline equals freedom.

2201
02:23:53,030 --> 02:23:57,980
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2202
02:23:58,520 --> 02:23:59,353
So

2203
02:24:00,730 --> 02:24:05,660
Echo is speaking of discipline,
perhaps in a discipline manner.

2204
02:24:06,230 --> 02:24:09,440
You could explain to
us how we could support

2205
02:24:10,840 --> 02:24:14,650
this podcast if we want it to.
If you want it for sure.

2206
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:20,260
I feel like we should,
like we always do in a disciplined way.

2207
02:24:20,620 --> 02:24:23,650
Talk about on it. Despite
discipline, I mean concise by the way

2208
02:24:25,570 --> 02:24:30,570
are over to member half
hours or something like that.

2209
02:24:32,090 --> 02:24:33,700
That doesn't control, that
doesn't, you're not even,

2210
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:36,100
that doesn't play into your head,
does it? You're in the game.

2211
02:24:36,130 --> 02:24:39,280
You're here throughout your job.
Done. You care longer takes correct.

2212
02:24:41,770 --> 02:24:45,400
Nonetheless. Last time I mentioned
that I ran out of Krill oil.

2213
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:49,480
You even said you should go
to the store and buy. So yeah.

2214
02:24:49,780 --> 02:24:54,430
Did you know the good thing is
when I went home from our session,

2215
02:24:54,670 --> 02:24:59,290
it had come in. Oh,
along with the orangutan.

2216
02:25:01,450 --> 02:25:05,410
Oh, you got an Kettlebell? Nice to have
them. Or just one. One. What's the weight?

2217
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:09,130
54 pounds. You need another
one? Yeah. So I want,

2218
02:25:09,131 --> 02:25:13,000
I want the Zombie one for
whatever the ranking ones. Cool.

2219
02:25:13,030 --> 02:25:16,510
But the Zombie one was really cool.
So they're out of them.

2220
02:25:17,890 --> 02:25:21,400
I think they're the same late 54 seven
one two 54 is they're out of them.

2221
02:25:21,401 --> 02:25:24,100
So I was like, yeah, I'll just get
one of these just, you know, as

2222
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:27,610
a one off. And then when the
Zombie ones come in check,

2223
02:25:27,820 --> 02:25:30,220
I'll get the two Zombie ones.
So where's this?

2224
02:25:30,700 --> 02:25:32,550
Is this store that you're talking thing,

2225
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:35,340
is that on at.com but I'm
explaining what it is. Just gives,

2226
02:25:35,350 --> 02:25:38,500
people don't know or they don't
understand the importance.

2227
02:25:40,090 --> 02:25:43,720
I think it's important. Nonetheless.
Krill oil came in. This is what you do.

2228
02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:46,750
And I mentioned this before
and this is what I'm gonna do.

2229
02:25:47,890 --> 02:25:52,630
I'm gonna try to do, I should just
do it in, it'll be done. Stay on it.

2230
02:25:53,020 --> 02:25:56,920
You know what that is, right?
Stay on it. Oh, the automatic,

2231
02:25:57,360 --> 02:26:02,300
the re Oh yeah. What do you even
call it? Three automatic automatic.

2232
02:26:02,301 --> 02:26:05,020
The ship kind of made a shipment.
Yeah.

2233
02:26:05,021 --> 02:26:07,690
You just pay every month and it
automatically comes. Yeah. Yeah.

2234
02:26:07,930 --> 02:26:09,970
I think you might even get a deal
on that one. I don't know though,

2235
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:12,460
but that's what I'm doing.
I'm a status called stay on it.

2236
02:26:13,180 --> 02:26:17,350
You know what men that's in a lot of
people or companies do that, you know,

2237
02:26:17,351 --> 02:26:20,870
like the other stuff. Yeah.

2238
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:22,560
I'm alon like toilet paper.

2239
02:26:22,561 --> 02:26:26,230
You know things that you just use all
duct tape duct constantly running out of

2240
02:26:26,231 --> 02:26:31,090
that. That's, that's a good deal.

2241
02:26:31,490 --> 02:26:34,870
I mean, that's a good thing to
do with basically everything.

2242
02:26:36,120 --> 02:26:37,780
At one time when I was drinking,

2243
02:26:39,650 --> 02:26:44,140
I don't drink anymore hardly.
Um, who was it? It was Rudy.

2244
02:26:44,141 --> 02:26:48,490
He asked me to do something of video or
something, I dunno. And he was like, Hey,

2245
02:26:48,491 --> 02:26:50,890
can I pay you in vodka and

2246
02:26:52,440 --> 02:26:56,530
I could have a savage. Ivan says that,
no rough crude anyway. And he goes,

2247
02:26:56,531 --> 02:26:59,530
can I pay you and vodka? I didn't
tell him to get out of here. I was,

2248
02:26:59,620 --> 02:27:01,810
I was considered, I was
like, wait a second.

2249
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:05,320
It kind of is like currency when you
drink every day, every day, you know,

2250
02:27:05,380 --> 02:27:08,380
it's kind of like, well, I'm going to
spend that money anyway. So I'm like, Hey,

2251
02:27:08,381 --> 02:27:09,750
you know what I could do,
I'm just thinking about,

2252
02:27:09,880 --> 02:27:11,320
it lasted for like five seconds,

2253
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:16,070
maybe 10 maybe 20 but I thought to myself,
hmm,

2254
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:18,520
think of how much money
I would've charged him,

2255
02:27:19,060 --> 02:27:23,470
like double it or triple it and
get that much worth of vodka. Boom.

2256
02:27:23,471 --> 02:27:26,270
I just saved 75 no,

2257
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:31,450
66% you know what I'm saying?
Okay. Move on. Nonetheless,

2258
02:27:31,451 --> 02:27:36,190
the point still stands
if it's,

2259
02:27:36,191 --> 02:27:38,110
if you don't have to think about it,
it just comes,

2260
02:27:38,340 --> 02:27:43,090
you start to run into this thing like me
where I'm at a Krill oil for one week.

2261
02:27:43,380 --> 02:27:45,190
Actually it was a little less than a week.
It doesn't matter.

2262
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:48,850
I won't be out of it at all. So yeah,
stay on it. That's the one krill oil.

2263
02:27:48,851 --> 02:27:52,510
Strawn bone didn't run out of that,
by the way. And that's good man.

2264
02:27:52,511 --> 02:27:57,340
That's stuff is good. It's weird how I
told you right how my shoulder was jack.

2265
02:27:57,340 --> 02:27:58,300
Like the Tim didn't party.

2266
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:01,270
He'll weird spot to get healthy
and I didn't even stop lifting.

2267
02:28:01,271 --> 02:28:03,100
You know how you get tendinitis?
You're like,

2268
02:28:03,101 --> 02:28:05,630
I gotta stop lifting or lifting lighter,
you know,

2269
02:28:08,430 --> 02:28:11,740
suckers Stromboli stay strong.

2270
02:28:11,741 --> 02:28:16,390
Get rid of the tendinitis and any bone
issues. I think if I'm not mistaken,

2271
02:28:16,391 --> 02:28:20,770
I'm not sure I got to go back on the
website. I get addicted to that website.

2272
02:28:20,771 --> 02:28:22,670
It's like interesting stuff.
Um,

2273
02:28:23,150 --> 02:28:27,890
I think it can delay or stop
the onset of osteoporosis.

2274
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:30,960
I don't want to make that clear.
I'm not making that claim. I'm not,

2275
02:28:30,970 --> 02:28:34,490
I'm not making it cause I'm just saying
that's what strontium does. Nonetheless,

2276
02:28:34,780 --> 02:28:38,930
a good kettle bells on their workout
stuff, especially if you like,

2277
02:28:38,960 --> 02:28:41,630
like you know how if you go in bench,

2278
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:47,240
I don't bench but if you do a, you know,
just repetitious shoulder press, I dunno,

2279
02:28:47,780 --> 02:28:48,980
it can get boring,

2280
02:28:50,300 --> 02:28:53,060
but if you're into like
interesting type workouts,

2281
02:28:53,061 --> 02:28:56,650
you know how like do you have a
mace right. One of those do. Yeah.

2282
02:28:56,680 --> 02:29:00,980
And you had clubs.
See Yeah.

2283
02:29:00,981 --> 02:29:03,620
See that's why you work out so much in
our early in the morning cause you're all

2284
02:29:03,630 --> 02:29:04,490
looking forward to it.

2285
02:29:04,491 --> 02:29:08,380
It's all interesting and fun if you're
into those interesting workouts and it's

2286
02:29:08,381 --> 02:29:11,540
cool cause you can like look up a bunch
of workouts just for one kettle bell,

2287
02:29:11,541 --> 02:29:15,920
you know. So maces and of course they
got the traditional stuff, jump rope,

2288
02:29:15,930 --> 02:29:20,870
whatnot. But um, like they
have these metal thanks.

2289
02:29:20,930 --> 02:29:23,960
I don't know what they are but it's like,
you know, these are for working out.

2290
02:29:23,961 --> 02:29:24,711
So it's like man,

2291
02:29:24,711 --> 02:29:29,711
you can't even get bored
working on anymore really
when you go in there anyway.

2292
02:29:30,440 --> 02:29:35,300
Websites. Interesting too. Anyway, this
stuff, the supplements are outstanding.

2293
02:29:35,301 --> 02:29:38,530
They do have, um, yeah.
I'm going to say it,

2294
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:43,610
this nut butter blend.
Also, I've got some MCT oil,

2295
02:29:44,570 --> 02:29:47,520
MCT, MCT stands for. Yes, I do.

2296
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:52,010
Medium chain triglycerides.
It's good for you. Anyway,

2297
02:29:52,011 --> 02:29:55,640
I cook with Owen and I put it in.
What didn't you make?

2298
02:29:55,641 --> 02:29:59,110
Like a decert with it or
something. All kinds of stuff,
but it was something. Sure.

2299
02:29:59,130 --> 02:30:03,110
Mct, heavy whipping cream,
something. Anyway, go on there.

2300
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:05,330
Get 10% off.
If you want 10% off,

2301
02:30:05,331 --> 02:30:09,860
go on it.com/jocko it's a good one.
Support Yourself, support your joints,

2302
02:30:10,310 --> 02:30:11,300
support your health.

2303
02:30:12,650 --> 02:30:15,980
I don't think you should
be in a situation anymore

2304
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:21,710
anymore, given the times we're
in to not support your health.

2305
02:30:21,950 --> 02:30:24,830
There's really no room for not
supporting your health right now.

2306
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:27,740
All your needs are met.

2307
02:30:27,830 --> 02:30:32,170
You're not going out and like
you're not hunting for food. Yeah.

2308
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:36,260
Nonetheless, do that on a
dotcom slash Jocko. Also,

2309
02:30:36,261 --> 02:30:39,950
good way to support your
brain is to read these books.

2310
02:30:40,700 --> 02:30:41,630
Eugene sledge,

2311
02:30:41,631 --> 02:30:46,631
another one from him trying to marine
also around a four and a rumor of war and

2312
02:30:48,201 --> 02:30:52,550
we go on,
I'm reading it upside down and we go on.

2313
02:30:53,460 --> 02:30:58,040
Um, those are powerful
books on the website, Jocko,
podcast.com there's a page,

2314
02:30:58,041 --> 02:31:01,340
it's called books from the episode
top Menu. Click on it, boom.

2315
02:31:01,430 --> 02:31:05,330
All the books from all the episodes
with the link directly to Amazon.

2316
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:09,170
You get those books through there.
That's good way to support Amazon.

2317
02:31:09,171 --> 02:31:11,420
Click through. Or if you're
doing any other kind of shopping,

2318
02:31:11,421 --> 02:31:16,421
just click through our website and get
whatever you're going to get including,

2319
02:31:16,941 --> 02:31:21,690
but not limited to these
books, duct tapes, duct tapes.

2320
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:26,670
Maybe you need multiple roles, duct tapes.
But even if there was multiple rules,

2321
02:31:26,671 --> 02:31:28,060
I think it's still duct tape.

2322
02:31:29,210 --> 02:31:34,050
Did you got different types
of duct tapes still? No.

2323
02:31:34,070 --> 02:31:35,760
Okay.
Or paper clips.

2324
02:31:35,780 --> 02:31:40,190
St Dealer or whichever macgyver stuff
that you're into. Getting a bad,

2325
02:31:40,191 --> 02:31:42,930
been getting more nice.
I'm going to bring them in for pro.

2326
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:46,680
You ever go on Amazon and
be like, hey, this is cool.

2327
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:49,440
And then you how they show you the little
suggestions and then you buy all the

2328
02:31:49,441 --> 02:31:52,300
suggestions. Do you ever done that
before by all the suggestions? No,

2329
02:31:52,310 --> 02:31:56,850
cause I've disciplined, I need, uh,

2330
02:31:56,851 --> 02:31:58,650
so I went on there and I got a flashlight.

2331
02:31:58,651 --> 02:32:03,060
You know how noddies flashlight
technology nowadays, especially nowadays,

2332
02:32:03,061 --> 02:32:05,210
back in the day, remember the ones
that you had a had had like a,

2333
02:32:05,430 --> 02:32:09,840
it was like a suitcase flashlight, but
they're big. So those were dope as a kid.

2334
02:32:09,870 --> 02:32:12,820
Like if you had that one, you're
like the man. Yeah, exactly right.

2335
02:32:12,821 --> 02:32:15,000
It's some kind of reliving it. So
I'm like, let me get a flashlight.

2336
02:32:15,001 --> 02:32:18,270
And then you look at all
the new flashlights out. Oh
my gosh, these are awesome.

2337
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:22,220
So I'm like, okay, I'm going to buy
this. I don't buy a MAG light back.

2338
02:32:22,221 --> 02:32:24,190
Lights are dope.
Cause he can hit people with it in the,

2339
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:26,490
in the event of having
to use it for a weapon.

2340
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:32,120
So I get one and then I click on it and
there's various options on the length of

2341
02:32:33,841 --> 02:32:38,550
it. I'm like, Ooh. So I get
the regular one camouflage
for my daughter. She's four.

2342
02:32:38,640 --> 02:32:42,990
She likes flashlights, like
all kids do. I get to, for me,

2343
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:48,030
one for Sarah Tooth, it's a long one.
It's like us. It's called like a six cell,

2344
02:32:48,060 --> 02:32:50,670
meaning it takes six batteries.
So you can imagine how long that thing,

2345
02:32:50,690 --> 02:32:54,690
it's like a straight up Bhutan
with a flashlight on it. So I got,

2346
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:59,700
I wind up getting nine flashlights.
I don't need nine flashlights.

2347
02:32:59,850 --> 02:33:03,430
This is an indication of a total lack of
discipline while they're on Amazon. Yes.

2348
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:08,340
I hope you didn't click through though.
Yeah. Yes I did. And I got a book too,

2349
02:33:08,430 --> 02:33:11,940
by the way, so yeah, sure.

2350
02:33:11,941 --> 02:33:15,270
I lacked Amazon flashlight
shopping discipline,

2351
02:33:16,170 --> 02:33:20,430
but I got some cool flashlights. There's
this technique here. I'll show you it.

2352
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:22,830
You might even know this,
but I learned this in bouncer.

2353
02:33:22,831 --> 02:33:27,030
It was security training and this was
a technique that you're this illegal to

2354
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:29,940
use. You can't use it as security
or because it's offensive.

2355
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:32,130
It's not insecurities,

2356
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:36,950
minimum force necessary to effect a
whatever to to defuse the situation,

2357
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,550
whatever.
So this is what it is.

2358
02:33:38,551 --> 02:33:43,530
Let's say this was a flashlight and
the say, this is the light part, right?

2359
02:33:43,980 --> 02:33:48,510
Like so usually as a lay person, you
hold the flashlight like this, right?

2360
02:33:49,090 --> 02:33:52,200
And you like in law enforcement and
stuff like that, they hold it like this.

2361
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:56,670
It's kind of up above like that. So
this is how you hold it. So you shut,

2362
02:33:56,960 --> 02:34:01,230
you grip it right there by the,
the head of it with the light.

2363
02:34:01,260 --> 02:34:05,580
You shine it in the guy's face and be
like, calm down, calm down, calm down.

2364
02:34:05,610 --> 02:34:07,920
They can't really see you there.
Just blinded by the light kind of.

2365
02:34:08,010 --> 02:34:10,590
And they're like, oh ha ha. And they hear
your voice saying calm down, calm down.

2366
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:14,370
And men you can get and you flip it around
and hit him with it and you get those

2367
02:34:14,371 --> 02:34:19,000
long mag lights that it,
the six cell full batteries,

2368
02:34:19,840 --> 02:34:23,620
boom. They don't see it coming.
They don't flinch, they don't blink,

2369
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,630
they don't anything.
It's just a complete,

2370
02:34:25,650 --> 02:34:30,400
you see light one moment for a split
second, the light kind of goes down,

2371
02:34:30,430 --> 02:34:34,630
then flash, then you see, yeah, you
wake up. That's it man. The video.

2372
02:34:34,631 --> 02:34:38,000
I saw a guy doing it to somebody.
I was like, Dang, that guy. It's,

2373
02:34:38,001 --> 02:34:42,970
it's like you know those eerie,
you know like when you see a person die,

2374
02:34:42,971 --> 02:34:44,260
whether it be on video or whatever,

2375
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:47,800
he gets to like shot and his body just
goes limp. He doesn't know what's coming,

2376
02:34:47,801 --> 02:34:51,610
nothing he but it looked like that he
got hit with it so square and so hard and

2377
02:34:51,611 --> 02:34:55,090
he didn't even flinch. It's a real
effective thing. Don't do it to people

2378
02:34:56,950 --> 02:35:00,580
unless they're in your house or
something like that. Anyway, I digress.

2379
02:35:02,140 --> 02:35:02,973
Also,

2380
02:35:03,790 --> 02:35:08,740
good way to support is subscribing
to the podcast, iTunes,

2381
02:35:08,741 --> 02:35:12,550
Google, Google, play,
Google, play, stitcher,

2382
02:35:13,360 --> 02:35:16,270
all these podcasting,
providing platforms.

2383
02:35:17,260 --> 02:35:21,560
Also Youtube technically as a podcast
providing platform, so subscribe to it.

2384
02:35:21,561 --> 02:35:23,800
Alan, here's the thing about
youtube. If you don't already,

2385
02:35:24,670 --> 02:35:29,670
it gives you the added benefit of being
able to see the video version juncos

2386
02:35:30,130 --> 02:35:34,090
face talking about these things,
so subscribe to that.

2387
02:35:34,091 --> 02:35:38,230
We'll add some other excerpts on there,
some enhanced excerpts

2388
02:35:39,730 --> 02:35:44,410
that when we're calling them. Sure they
enhanced one. What's the music on there,

2389
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:46,930
right? Some B roll.
That's what it's called.

2390
02:35:46,990 --> 02:35:51,500
Bureau and think that that's
not the actual thing anyway. Um,

2391
02:35:51,850 --> 02:35:55,780
and also what did I say I was going to
put on there last time I was going to put

2392
02:35:55,781 --> 02:35:59,620
on something on Youtube.
Yeah, some more videos,

2393
02:35:59,710 --> 02:36:01,140
more videos or whatever.

2394
02:36:03,660 --> 02:36:07,990
It's just a theory at this point, but
nonetheless subscribe and boom, you can,

2395
02:36:07,991 --> 02:36:12,640
you know, support that way.
Also, Jack was a store.

2396
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:17,500
It's called chocolate store.
What's the website?

2397
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:19,150
It's an online store,

2398
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:23,410
Jocko store.com so what this has,

2399
02:36:23,411 --> 02:36:26,770
if you don't know already is t shirts,

2400
02:36:28,630 --> 02:36:32,920
hoodies. I think I'm going to put some
light hoodies on their summertime.

2401
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:38,950
You don't like that? I do. No
heavier. Nothing. Yes. Heavy
heavy Hoodie or no shirt?

2402
02:36:39,630 --> 02:36:43,570
Yes. To wear tank tops.
Not really. Oh you do?

2403
02:36:44,250 --> 02:36:44,610
Yes.

2404
02:36:44,610 --> 02:36:48,450
My wife threw a bunch of minor away
about five or seven years ago because she

2405
02:36:48,451 --> 02:36:49,520
doesn't like the wrong,
no,

2406
02:36:49,530 --> 02:36:52,680
they were just all old and ratty
and just throw them away randomly,

2407
02:36:53,130 --> 02:36:57,390
which was awesome. Just don't throw
really, because that was a longer me.

2408
02:36:57,930 --> 02:36:59,700
That's not cool.
It's one of those,

2409
02:36:59,701 --> 02:37:03,060
it's like one of the four things that
I still bring up to her. No kidding.

2410
02:37:03,430 --> 02:37:05,100
She'd be like, oh, can't
believe how hot it is today.

2411
02:37:05,850 --> 02:37:07,110
I'd be comfortable if I had a tank top.

2412
02:37:07,111 --> 02:37:12,040
I don't have any because
you threw them away. Yeah,

2413
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:15,680
no, they were nice. She does it
like the way you look in those tops,

2414
02:37:16,130 --> 02:37:20,840
it's offensive. Their
sensibility. Cool. Yeah, man.

2415
02:37:20,841 --> 02:37:24,530
I'm just saying, you know, stop pointing
the finger. Start playing in left thumb.

2416
02:37:24,770 --> 02:37:28,700
Right. That's the expression, right? Yeah,
yeah, yeah. You gotta watch out for that.

2417
02:37:29,030 --> 02:37:33,680
Strangely, I don't watch out for your tank
tops are barely in my house, you know,

2418
02:37:33,681 --> 02:37:35,150
point there is someone did say,

2419
02:37:35,151 --> 02:37:39,680
actually not many people saying tank tops
will be cool. I don't wear tank tops.

2420
02:37:41,710 --> 02:37:45,550
You do? Apparently still.
That's obviously a sore subject.

2421
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:48,880
Yeah. Let's make some tank tops off
of, do my whole wardrobe with tag down.

2422
02:37:50,410 --> 02:37:51,520
Bring them back in the game.

2423
02:37:52,700 --> 02:37:56,340
Thank [inaudible]. Yeah. Ooh, Dang. Yeah.

2424
02:37:56,341 --> 02:37:59,400
You know those kind of put them on the,
on the sander or whatever.

2425
02:38:00,990 --> 02:38:04,200
Nonetheless, shirts are cool. If you
think they're cool, check checking out.

2426
02:38:04,230 --> 02:38:07,590
[inaudible] dot com go in there, check
out the shirts. This rash guards on there.

2427
02:38:07,650 --> 02:38:11,100
I think I, I'm saying obviously just
my opinion, the rash guards are cool.

2428
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:16,480
That's like to me actually there's
a lot of good things on there,

2429
02:38:16,481 --> 02:38:19,540
my opinion, but nonetheless,
shirts on there. They're cool. Um,

2430
02:38:19,720 --> 02:38:23,000
if you want to support,
do it that way cause the website,

2431
02:38:23,030 --> 02:38:27,310
see if you like something, get
something. Hats are coming soon,

2432
02:38:27,850 --> 02:38:31,330
whatever that means. But
they'll be here soon. Also,

2433
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:37,120
psychological warfare. If you didn't
know what that is, I know you do,

2434
02:38:37,121 --> 02:38:40,060
but let's say you didn't know what
that was here. I'm going to tell you,

2435
02:38:40,120 --> 02:38:44,610
it is an album with tracks Jocko tracks.

2436
02:38:44,960 --> 02:38:48,400
Jack was saying what?
Hey,

2437
02:38:48,610 --> 02:38:50,800
these are the pragmatic,

2438
02:38:50,830 --> 02:38:55,830
logical reasons why you shouldn't slip
on your diet or your waking up early or

2439
02:38:57,940 --> 02:39:00,280
this is why you should not
skip through the workout.

2440
02:39:00,430 --> 02:39:02,020
This is why you shouldn't
slack on the workout.

2441
02:39:02,050 --> 02:39:03,970
Like all these little things that you'll,

2442
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:09,000
the probability of you slacking on
certain things in life are they fluctuate

2443
02:39:10,091 --> 02:39:14,500
really, but in the event of you slacking
on something and you need a spot, verbal,

2444
02:39:14,980 --> 02:39:19,850
verbal and psychological,
get this,

2445
02:39:19,851 --> 02:39:22,070
check this out.
Search psychological warfare,

2446
02:39:22,100 --> 02:39:26,000
Jocko Willink on iTunes or Amazon
music or wherever they sell mp3s.

2447
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:28,340
Get that and get a little spot.

2448
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:33,890
Get a little spot for your points
of weakness in your journey.

2449
02:39:33,950 --> 02:39:35,750
I said it and that helps.

2450
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:41,030
Also, you can get Jocko white
tea on Amazon. By the way,

2451
02:39:41,060 --> 02:39:42,920
we talked about a little bit today.

2452
02:39:43,460 --> 02:39:48,460
The person said that they drank a couple
of Jocko white tea this morning before

2453
02:39:49,431 --> 02:39:54,170
I left for muster zero zero two and ended
up at muster zero zero one not saying

2454
02:39:54,171 --> 02:39:57,440
that I've proven Jocko white tea allows
you to travel through time and space,

2455
02:39:57,441 --> 02:40:00,860
but here we are. So again, this
is a verified purchase review.

2456
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,040
So this is the person that
actually experienced this.

2457
02:40:03,041 --> 02:40:05,780
So we need to keep that in mind.
Jocko white tea,

2458
02:40:05,810 --> 02:40:10,100
you get home to amazon.com
also weigh the warrior kid

2459
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:14,040
book for kids

2460
02:40:14,940 --> 02:40:17,910
and possibly adults.

2461
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:22,590
I think we're starting to
see that here is a review.

2462
02:40:22,710 --> 02:40:24,360
I wish I had read this book before.

2463
02:40:25,260 --> 02:40:28,950
It gives you an excellent path
to a successful, fulfilled
life. It is very easy,

2464
02:40:28,951 --> 02:40:30,960
but don't be fooled.
It's incredibly deep too.

2465
02:40:31,200 --> 02:40:35,190
I think it is great for a 10 year old or
for an 80 year old as you are never too

2466
02:40:35,191 --> 02:40:38,910
old or too young to learn the basics
of an honorable life worth living.

2467
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:42,480
Fantastic. 100 stars,
so that's pretty cool.

2468
02:40:44,010 --> 02:40:48,300
Pick up the book.
It's about how to be better,

2469
02:40:48,690 --> 02:40:53,690
how to overcome the obstacles that we
all face and it's told through the voice

2470
02:40:55,080 --> 02:40:58,710
of a 10 year old boy
named mark and his uncle,

2471
02:41:00,210 --> 02:41:01,043
Uncle Jake,

2472
02:41:01,530 --> 02:41:05,640
who comes into his life to help them
overcome some of these obstacles.

2473
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:06,750
So there you go.

2474
02:41:06,750 --> 02:41:11,750
That's where the warrior
kid also discipline equals
freedom field manual editing

2475
02:41:11,911 --> 02:41:13,680
is complete at this time.

2476
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:18,840
So many of these questions I get asked
all about all the time are laid out in

2477
02:41:18,841 --> 02:41:23,280
his book, food workouts, martial arts,

2478
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:28,140
and my,
my operating system.

2479
02:41:29,780 --> 02:41:34,120
Once you, that I've talked about on
the, on this podcast is in the book,

2480
02:41:34,660 --> 02:41:36,400
in a written form.

2481
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:41,460
This book is like the podcast that you
can read and absorb and refer back to.

2482
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:48,940
So
the book is like the podcast,

2483
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:53,740
but you're going to see it's not
a normal book. It's not normal.

2484
02:41:54,130 --> 02:41:57,010
My publishers says we've never
published anything like this.

2485
02:41:57,011 --> 02:41:59,170
I don't think there's anything
else published like this ever.

2486
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:01,750
So it's a little different.
It's not a regular book,

2487
02:42:01,990 --> 02:42:05,800
just like this isn't a regular podcast
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2488
02:42:06,460 --> 02:42:08,110
You can preorder it right now.
And of course,

2489
02:42:08,111 --> 02:42:13,111
extreme ownership leadership book is
based on what I learned during 20 years in

2490
02:42:15,341 --> 02:42:20,341
the seal teams about leadership
and especially from the
battle of Ramadi and how

2491
02:42:22,391 --> 02:42:26,050
to take those lessons and
apply them to the battlefield,

2492
02:42:26,230 --> 02:42:28,060
to business and to life.

2493
02:42:28,090 --> 02:42:32,080
Wrote that with my brother Leif Babin
who was on the battlefield with me in

2494
02:42:32,081 --> 02:42:36,970
Ramadi. Also, we have leadership and
management consulting company, me, Leif,

2495
02:42:36,971 --> 02:42:39,160
Babin, JP Denelle, Dave Burke,

2496
02:42:40,510 --> 02:42:43,510
leadership and management
or alignment for your team.

2497
02:42:45,410 --> 02:42:50,410
If you want that email
info@echelonfront.com and
finally the Muster Austin,

2498
02:42:52,971 --> 02:42:57,230
Texas July 13th and 14th too late.
Sold out. We're done with that one.

2499
02:42:58,040 --> 02:42:59,360
Not done with it.
It's still gonna happen.

2500
02:42:59,361 --> 02:43:02,240
But you can't come because it's sold out.
No more seats.

2501
02:43:02,241 --> 02:43:03,620
We were able to bump it up a little bit.

2502
02:43:03,621 --> 02:43:08,140
I think we've got to like three 20
or three 30 but that's a lot. Um,

2503
02:43:08,300 --> 02:43:12,070
we were supposed to only have
300 and then rearrange some

2504
02:43:12,070 --> 02:43:16,180
seats or whatever. So we got it to three
20 I think. But that's it. We can't,

2505
02:43:16,750 --> 02:43:18,910
we cannot put anyone
else in there sold out.

2506
02:43:19,150 --> 02:43:21,160
So the next shot is back in San Diego,

2507
02:43:21,161 --> 02:43:26,050
September 14th and 15th back the
Omni hotel on the bay in San Diego.

2508
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:31,960
A lot of people from the first muster
in San Diego are coming back and I think

2509
02:43:31,961 --> 02:43:35,620
that will be awesome to hear
from people. Okay. You went,

2510
02:43:35,621 --> 02:43:38,890
you went to the first muster,
you were, you learn some things,

2511
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:42,310
then you brought him back to apply them
real world. You hit some obstacles.

2512
02:43:42,820 --> 02:43:45,220
What are the obstacles that you hit? Let's
figure it out, how to get around them.

2513
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:51,250
That's musters zero zero for San
Diego, California. After that,

2514
02:43:51,251 --> 02:43:54,340
we're not going to go again with
a monster for awhile, you know,

2515
02:43:54,341 --> 02:43:59,341
at least until sometime in 2018
probably once again in the springtime,

2516
02:43:59,650 --> 02:44:04,600
but later in the spring.
So be aware of that.

2517
02:44:04,630 --> 02:44:09,430
If you don't come to September, it's
going to be awhile. And until the muster,

2518
02:44:10,030 --> 02:44:12,520
if you do want to communicate
and hang out a little bit,

2519
02:44:12,521 --> 02:44:15,310
you can find us getting af.
Well,

2520
02:44:15,311 --> 02:44:16,900
you're not really getting
after it on the Internet,

2521
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:21,280
but you can find us typing letters
into a keyboard on the interwebs.

2522
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:23,470
That's right on Twitter,

2523
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:27,250
on Instagram and in the Facebook.

2524
02:44:27,280 --> 02:44:32,280
Keep whole-hog echo is that Echo Charles
and I am at Jocko Willink and thanks

2525
02:44:35,021 --> 02:44:39,340
for listening and subscribing and
supporting and spreading the word,

2526
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:41,710
but more important.

2527
02:44:41,711 --> 02:44:46,711
Thanks for grabbing a hold
of the challenges and the
struggles in your life and

2528
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:53,940
learning from them and then climbing up
those challenges like a Jacob's ladder

2529
02:44:57,320 --> 02:45:01,790
and using them to elevate yourself
instead of letting them drag you down.

2530
02:45:02,390 --> 02:45:06,960
And when you get to the top,
look around

2531
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:13,620
and give someone else a hand, pull
them up, tell them what you learned.

2532
02:45:14,310 --> 02:45:16,170
Try to do it in a tactful way.

2533
02:45:16,171 --> 02:45:21,171
Try and teach them and look around and
see who can help you and teach you and

2534
02:45:21,661 --> 02:45:23,910
what you can learn from other people

2535
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:29,620
and teach people to overcome
challenges the same way that you did.

2536
02:45:29,830 --> 02:45:34,830
The same way we all did by learning from
our problems and our challenges and our

2537
02:45:35,441 --> 02:45:38,590
struggles.
And after we learn from them,

2538
02:45:38,770 --> 02:45:41,110
we grabbed them by the throat,

2539
02:45:43,020 --> 02:45:47,290
get after it.
So until next time,

2540
02:45:48,430 --> 02:45:52,870
this is echo and Jocko
out.
