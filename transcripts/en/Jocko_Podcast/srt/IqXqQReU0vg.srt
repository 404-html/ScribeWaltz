00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,750
This is Jocko podcast number
61 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,990
Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good me.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,640
So it's been a few episodes
since we got into the Q and.

4
00:00:17,701 --> 00:00:18,534
A.
I'm sure.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,250
So today we're gonna go right
into questions that come,

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,220
they actually come from the
interwebs. Sure. People out there.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,270
So everyone that's gives
questions. Appreciate it.
Thank you for the questions.

8
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:35,640
I can't answer them all but
talking to some people out there,

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,310
if you listen to the different questions
you can figure out your own answers to

10
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:42,570
a lot of them.
Yeah.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,920
You like learn the formulas
and then you can apply.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,410
But thanks for the questions.
Appreciate it. Sometimes when you,

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,520
in my experience anyway, when
I think, okay I'm going to,

14
00:00:56,521 --> 00:01:00,300
I'm going to ask Jocko this question
and then you either write it out or you

15
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,710
didn't.
One I remember the other day when I,

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,670
when I busted out questions
and when I say them out loud,

17
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,890
it was like a few weeks ago
and I say it out loud when I'm,

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,190
as I'm saying it to you, I'm like, oh,
I know that's already cause you know,

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,300
you realize seeking, kind of utilize that
hole. So you've started to get the uh,

20
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,660
formulas in your own head and now
as you're saying and be saying, oh,

21
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:26,400
I know what the answer. No, yes, exactly.
How do I get out of bed in the morning?

22
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,450
How do I be mentally tougher?
Be Mentally tougher. All right,

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,870
rock and roll. First question, go Jocko.

24
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:41,871
Hydroco today I had what I believe you
referred to as disciplinary breakdown.

25
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,900
This morning I found out that I had to
take additional credits in college and

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,850
that I believe were completed.
So he thought they were complete.

27
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:54,360
He had to take more.
As it turns out in a fit of rage,

28
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,080
I took my phone and threw it
across the room in frustration.

29
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,490
I felt really good at at time,

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,780
but five seconds later regretted
it because now broken phone

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,380
and I lost control of my emotions.

32
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,030
So do you have any mental
tricks or anything in general
that you do when you're

33
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,200
slightly irritated or outright furious?
Ps,

34
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,400
this used to happen a lot more.

35
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:19,200
I started to Jitsu and haven't
rolled for three weeks.

36
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,580
Maybe I'm reading too much into it,

37
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:22,710
but I felt great whenever
I was rolling consistently.

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,460
Hmm. Maybe anecdotal. However,

39
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,250
we do know that Jujitsu
soothes the soul. Uh, so,

40
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,000
well, one of the things in mean,
and you've talked about this too,

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,540
when I realized that losing your
temper was a sign of weakness.

42
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,700
As soon as I read it, soon as I made
that connection, I said to myself,

43
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,220
this week I'm going to
try not to do it anymore.

44
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,420
And what's weird is when you're a kid,
I don't know if you remember this,

45
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:59,421
but when I was a kid and you'd see
someone get angry and it made you afraid.

46
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,960
And so for a while I saw it
as like a power, you know,

47
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:09,961
it's kind of a way to achieve power that
you can lose your temper and then all

48
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:14,440
of a sudden you have this extra strength.
And so when you're a little kid,

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,060
and when I say a little kid, I mean when
I was 1314 years old, I thought, hey,

50
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,960
if I go, if I could get that rage
going, and people are scared,

51
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:27,130
like I used to feel, that's a
positive thing. And then like I said,

52
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:29,050
as I got older,
now you know,

53
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:33,670
now you're talking 1615 1617 I realized,
hey,

54
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,040
this isn't, this isn't cool. This isn't
strength. It's actually a weakness.

55
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,850
And when I realized it was weakness,
and I didn't realize that overnight,

56
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,590
but I started getting the
idea that that was weakness.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,120
And now
when you see someone that is in control,

58
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,460
and even when bad things are
happening there, you know, they're,

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,680
they're standing stoically saying,
okay,

60
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,260
let me take another look at that and
I'll get it done. You know what I mean?

61
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:03,970
When they're just, okay, then you realize,
okay, this guy's really unflappable,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,980
which is a lot more impressive. So again,

63
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,760
you, you gotta be able to
detach from this. And you know,

64
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:16,210
I like to take pride in the fact that
I'm going to keep my cool no matter what

65
00:04:16,211 --> 00:04:19,060
happens. And definitely once I was in
that, once you're in the seal teams,

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,580
you definitely want to be
that guy that's keeping your,

67
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,900
keeping your cool no
matter what's happening,

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,660
whether it's people or
doing the wrong thing,

69
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,840
or you just want to be the guy that's,
hey, okay, come back over here.

70
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,530
We need to Redo this.

71
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,310
You just want to be that guy that's way
more impressive than the guy that says,

72
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:38,240
I can't believe this. Don't
be that person. So, and I've
talked about this before,

73
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:43,241
and what are the pre event indicators
that show you or revealed to you that your

74
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:49,800
temper is about to be lost? What are
they? Is it you clench your fist,

75
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:54,130
right? Is it you raise your voice and
you start doing it, getting that stuff?

76
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,450
Do you start to heavy breathing? Do you
feel you flair your nostrils, right?

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,710
Cause that's an animal thing where
you're going to take in more oxygen.

78
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:05,680
So you open up the nostrils cause you're
about to get after it. Do you, you know,

79
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:10,210
use your, does your, your head,
you know, shaking or whatever.

80
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,070
You can just like these things.
What is it,

81
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,940
what indicators do you have when you
know that you're starting to feel that?

82
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:20,890
And as soon as you feel that you
detach, you go, oh, that's what that is.

83
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:25,000
That's an indicator and it's a weakness.
And I don't like weakness,

84
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,930
so I'm not going to allow it and then

85
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,880
know, take a breath. I
like to say, you know what,

86
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,980
here's a good one. You want to, you
want to get through that, that moment.

87
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,010
Nod your head slowly in the affirmative.

88
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,150
Right? So, so when someone's telling
me something that's making me mad,

89
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,120
I'll just slowly nod my head.
Like,

90
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,760
I understand this is the way things are.

91
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,960
I accept this and this is

92
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,820
calculating what my next move is
going to be. Uh and then you know,

93
00:06:05,821 --> 00:06:09,080
you see whatever, you know,
guys will count to 10 you know,

94
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:12,260
you tell you a little kids that tell
you a little kids when they start losing

95
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:12,900
their temper,

96
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,070
you know what you need to count to 10
count to 10 count to a hundred counter

97
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:16,431
thousand,

98
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:21,431
whatever did you gotta do and
get control because like I said,

99
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,140
if you're losing control it's
not strength. It's a weakness.

100
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,363
Yeah.

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,840
I said this before where I read
this book called Mind Games.

102
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:35,480
Small little book.
Talked about anger management.

103
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:40,130
Like if people have anger
issues you realized it was
low or they said it was low

104
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:41,060
self as they say.
Yeah.

105
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:44,720
Anger issues stem from low self esteem
and that was really embarrassing.

106
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,260
You know,

107
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,190
I didn't have anger issues but I'm saying
if someone ever told me like oh you

108
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,780
have low self esteem or something like
that, that would be pretty embarrassing.

109
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:58,790
I always thought and so to
me I took that as an extreme,

110
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,480
being so sensitive to the,
even the expression low
self esteem. Now I was like,

111
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,350
oh I can never get angry
again. It says right there,
everyone gets angry, you know,

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,780
so that was always on my mind. Anytime
I started to feel mad, I was like,

113
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,310
okay,
I feel mad right now,

114
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:16,340
but I don't want to have low self
esteem so I better act. Right. You know,

115
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:20,870
kind of thing. And then after awhile
it just became habitual. Um, but the,

116
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,300
you know,
oh I see.

117
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,390
Like there's a difference between how you
feel and how you behave. Like you fit,

118
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,310
you have feelings, you know, but then

119
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,950
you know, you're mad.
Yeah. These mad feelings.

120
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:39,990
So what are you going to go and
straight up behave mad, you know? Yeah.

121
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,660
And a lot of people do it and a lot of
people we actually behave mad and justify

122
00:07:44,661 --> 00:07:48,650
it because that's my true feelings. But
again, they're two different things, man.

123
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,073
Don't,

124
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,350
don't act toward your true
feelings in front of everybody.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,930
Good. No, not good. Not Good.
Yeah. The, the, I dig it though.

126
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:04,560
Like, you know, cause you know that
feeling true feelings by the way.

127
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,290
The reason I'm saying that is if you
act on your true feelings all the time,

128
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,240
you won't get the long term
place where you want to be. Yeah.

129
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,870
True feelings do not lead you to your
true destination. Right? They don't want,

130
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,290
my gosh, so don't
actually, when you're fast,

131
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,890
keep your true feelings focused on the
true destination that you want to be at

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
and the true feelings that you have of
the anger and frustration and wanting to

133
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,510
yell at somebody and all that other
stupid stuff. Yeah. You know what?

134
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:30,030
You end up with a broken iPhone
cause you hooked it on the path.

135
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,600
That's what you went off with.
How's this

136
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,130
story time?
I'll make it quick.

137
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,330
So what am I crazy for a long time ago?

138
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,860
Oh my name is Chris.

139
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,340
So it's driving gets cut off
or something. You know, rotary,

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,670
just situation. True feelings,
right? True feelings. Oh that guy.

141
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,900
I want to beat him up. I want
to, I want to hurt him. Road

142
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,390
yells something or whatever.
Maybe other guy yelled at him first.

143
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
I don't know how, who started
what? But they pull over,

144
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:06,960
get into a fight that Chi in a way at the
time that feels like the fantasy right

145
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:10,800
there. Wish I could fight this guy.
I hope I the store I'm going to,

146
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:13,130
I hope he's right there so I can
fight them. I don't know. Whatever.

147
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,390
That's a fancy, that's
your feelings. So anyway,

148
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,320
Chris gets in a fight with this
guy on the side of the road,

149
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:23,580
grown adult by the way, fights
the guy, tears his peck tears in.

150
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,050
Chris tells his own peck. Yes. In the
fight. I Dunno if he won or lost whatever.

151
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,610
He's coming to work a little
bit. Doesn't matter. Yeah,

152
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,260
torn Pec is his six month injury
and the surgery yet, you know,

153
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,530
can you work with a torn Pec when most
of the time, probably not. You know,

154
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,960
and all because you know the guy cut
you off or wasn't going fast enough for,

155
00:09:43,961 --> 00:09:45,960
it was going, you know, to
fat, whatever. You know,

156
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,110
it's one of those things and that's,
that's what your true feelings get you.

157
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,790
Was she in the moment, especially
when it's anger. It's weird.

158
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,730
We'll have to explore that at some point
because I know it doesn't make sense.

159
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,970
I'm not sitting here saying
everyone's suppress all your feelings.

160
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:04,530
All your real feeling. Yeah.
But the stupid feelings, do
you have suppressed those?

161
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,740
Let them let them manifest themselves
over time for a longterm result.

162
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,190
That's going to be what you actually
want in life. Usually the anger.

163
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,190
Yeah. Anger for sure. It's wonderful,
but anger, jealousy, uh, ego,

164
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,000
all those things.
Yeah.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,510
Those are all things that if you
just act on them all the time,

166
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,810
you're not going to have a good time.
I'm life.

167
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,330
I'm here to tell you and every single
feeling when you're drunk next,

168
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,880
what are those? Those are not good.
Yeah. Don't act on those either.

169
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,020
Now she wished I led a
session based on the book,

170
00:10:40,021 --> 00:10:44,670
extreme ownership to my team at work.
I'm not the leader, but everyone,

171
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,340
including our manager, was very
supportive and enjoyed the session.

172
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,590
The challenge from a team member was,

173
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,260
is there such thing as
taking too much ownership?

174
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,520
Why don't you start feeling guilty
about not succeeding completely?

175
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,740
This guilt would not be a good thing.
Thoughts on handling this?

176
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,560
Well, there's definitely a thing. You
can definitely take too much ownership,

177
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,440
but not for that reason. And I've
talked about this before, if you,

178
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:10,274
if you're taking to refine,

179
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,270
if you and I are on a team and I'm the
leader and we've got a mission and I take

180
00:11:14,271 --> 00:11:17,050
so much ownership that I say, okay, echo,
this is how we're going to do everything.

181
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,060
You're going to listen to me, I own
this and I don't give you any ownership.

182
00:11:20,061 --> 00:11:21,080
Now it's not your plan.

183
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,840
And so now you don't execute it the best
way and you don't buy into it and all

184
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:27,280
that stuff. So that is how you take too
much ownership. It takes away the no.

185
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,180
If you take too much
ownership as a leader,

186
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,170
you take away ownership from
your subordinates. And so
you've taken, and again,

187
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,950
it's that's overt ownership.

188
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:38,840
If I take over ownership now,

189
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:43,010
if I give you the mission and you go out
and execute it and you mess it up and I

190
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:44,780
say, okay, I coag didn't
give you enough guidance.

191
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,250
I didn't give you the support
and give you the training.

192
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm going to own the mistakes.
I'm going to own the failure overtly.

193
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,380
But covertly. If I'm giving you
the mission, I'm going say, Hey,

194
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:56,110
you take it and run with it. So that's
where you need to be careful of that.

195
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,290
But guilt for failing
is not a valid cause.

196
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:05,860
Not to take ownership, right? Guess
what? When you fail something, yeah,

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,630
you're going to feel guilty, but
it's a different kind of you.

198
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:15,460
It's more of a disappointment
because things didn't go your way.

199
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,680
All right,
and I'll tell you when you feel guilty,

200
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,020
when you feel guilty to me is
if I know haven't done my best.

201
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,460
I know I cut corners. I know I
didn't invest the time. I know I,

202
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,970
you know, didn't give it
everything I could as a leader.

203
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,830
That's when I feel guilty.

204
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,950
If I give it everything and I've done
everything I can and I look back and of

205
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:38,260
course Hines, there's going to be
things that you didn't predict, right?

206
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,770
Hindsight's 2020 we all know that there's
going to be things where you look back

207
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:45,940
and you say, I wish I would've made a
different decision. But you have to.

208
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,180
You have to say, okay, so what are you
gonna do in the future? Be Indecisive now.

209
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,440
Are you not going to make decisions?

210
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,920
Even at that moment when I made the
decision which, which was wrong,

211
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,530
now that we can see hindsight,
well, what were you going to do?

212
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,980
You're going to wait and sit around
and do nothing and now we get attacked.

213
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:03,400
We get maneuvered on, we
get the competitor moves or
the enemy moves on as well.

214
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,200
So you might feel disappointed
that you made the wrong decision.

215
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,330
You might feel that type of guilt.

216
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:14,310
But w w the real guilt for me is if I,

217
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,370
I didn't give everything
I could to the situation.

218
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:23,110
So that's what causes guilt to me.
Now the failure,

219
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,310
okay,

220
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,140
an actual failure.
It shouldn't cause that level of guilt.

221
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:32,420
It should cause you to dig deep and
figure out what happened and want to

222
00:13:32,421 --> 00:13:33,560
reattach it.
That's what it should do.

223
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:38,480
It should cause you to want to
figure out where you failed,

224
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:43,040
where your team failed, and what you can
do to ensure that never happens again.

225
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,680
If you want to call that guilt,
you can call it guilt,

226
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:48,380
but that is not a reason not
to take ownership. You know,

227
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:53,210
I might call it disappointment.
It's a, what I'll call it,
I'll call it motivation,

228
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,660
you know, and I, you know, I don't
throw that word around easily,

229
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,080
but if I fail at something,
I'm going to be motivated to make sure I,

230
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,500
I get it back on back in line and
get that thing squared away. So,

231
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,340
okay.

232
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,120
Take ownership. If you
know, take ownership,

233
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,320
get things done right.
And if you fail,

234
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,510
don't feel guilty, don't
get guilty, get aggressive,

235
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,220
find the problems and get them solved.
That's it. Re Attack Yemen. Makes Sense.

236
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:28,580
Yeah. So the guilt is what kind of like,
Dang, it's all my fault. Like knowing,

237
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,120
you know, taking ownership for sure,
but it's like, Dang, it's all my fault.

238
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:35,220
This failure. Look at everyone's, I know
a guy lost his commissioner on it. Right,

239
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,850
right. Dang. That kind of guilt
thing. Yeah. And you know,

240
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,690
I say this with businesses there.
Do you know, like you just said,

241
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,030
you make someone lose their commission
because you couldn't get the deal done

242
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:48,160
fast enough. You couldn't give the
guy the support that they needed.

243
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,980
Now they lose commission.
You can sure you can feel guilty

244
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,810
about that. Is that a reason not to
take ownership of it? Absolutely not.

245
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,860
It's a reason to take more ownership
and be like, okay buddy, echo,

246
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,920
I know you lost commission on that.
Here's what I think. I let you down.

247
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,390
Here's what we need to communicate better.

248
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,750
Here's what I need to prepare and be
ready to support you next time so this

249
00:15:08,751 --> 00:15:11,120
doesn't happen again.
Are you with me? Right.

250
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,190
As opposed to saying not taking ownership
and saying, well, you know, Echo,

251
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,380
that was kind of, you know, those
deals don't always work out.

252
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,490
Maybe you should prepare better. Does
that make me feel good as a leader? Mouth.

253
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,280
It makes me feel like an idiot.

254
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,620
It's kind of like the swamps of sadness.
So the swamps upset,

255
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,540
sadness to me in when you get,
don't want to visit.

256
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,240
Those are some of the never ending
story when it's basically you go through

257
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:42,350
these swaps and it's super
hard. No, but it makes sense.

258
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:47,000
It's a metaphor for life. Lisa
was a movie. It's a movie.

259
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,440
It's a classic neverending
story. Yeah, the never ending
story. Anyway, the swamps,

260
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:54,320
the set, and it's, they're hard to walk
through them. It's like, it's hard.

261
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:57,620
It's a swamp. Quicksand everywhere,
quick swamp, whatever. You know,

262
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,820
they're not actually saying,
but so you sync and the more you sink,

263
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:05,630
the Saturday you get the set you get,
the more you sink. So you gotta like,

264
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,493
you know how you say,
oh,

265
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,190
like if someone's feeling guilty
in this case or if you get sad,

266
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:13,880
a lot of times you get sad and you're
like, oh, I'm such a sad downward spiral.

267
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,150
That downward spirals. Exactly.
So you got to fight this thing.

268
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:19,130
You got to fight this on to the
sadness and get aggressive and work.

269
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,090
It's not easy. Totally not easy.
That's what the why it's this one.

270
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,460
How do they cover the fact that if
you're in the swamp and you're sinking,

271
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,400
if you panic, you'll
also sync more. Oh yeah.

272
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,010
They didn't getting aggressive cause
getting aggressive might just be like

273
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:34,120
thrashing around and now you're running
out of breath as you're sinking. Yeah,

274
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,020
they'd cover that now that they don't
cover that, miss that on the metaphor.

275
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,690
They now need to rethink
the swan cassettes. No,

276
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,000
no. Well I don't think that
that was real in the water.

277
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,850
You know when you're in the
water. Yeah. If you get panicky,

278
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
your breath is going faster. Your oxygen's
going quicker, you're going to die.

279
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,420
You have to relax.
You have to learn to relax.

280
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,480
You got to have an ax and just
switch into problem solving mode.

281
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,110
Really
don't let this one,

282
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,510
but it is true that you can go in
the downward spiral and you know,

283
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:15,260
we see that in people's lives,
right. People's lives, they, they,

284
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,180
they mess, they lose their
job. And instead of going,

285
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:23,000
cool opportunity and somebody just hit
me up on social media the other day,

286
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,020
it's like, lost my job. Good. I got an
opportunity to go out, find another job.

287
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:30,380
I'm going to step up. Like
that's what you do. Yeah. Yeah.

288
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,000
And as opposed to boss my job,
oh no, what am I gonna do?

289
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,670
And now you start going down the downward
spiral because now you can't pay your

290
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:41,030
rent. Next thing you know, you're
losing your, your apartment and now you,

291
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,600
now you can't pay your car payment
either and now you're losing your car.

292
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,380
So what do we do? How does that
help? Doesn't help out. Don't panic.

293
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,310
Get aggressive.

294
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,740
Figure out what you're going to do next.
Take advantage of this situation. No,

295
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,250
Dang. That's good. Next
question. Next question.

296
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,570
Can you talk about the experience
of rolling with Hixon? Oh,

297
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,720
how impressed were you? Uh, I answered
this on Twitter. Someone said,

298
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,380
how impressed were you?
I responded, all caps.

299
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,380
Impressed.
So Jujitsu,

300
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,170
I, I was, this is backing, this is,

301
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,700
well, it's back in the dairy,
so it's back in the day.

302
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,670
And I was at team one at the time and,

303
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,470
and so I think we're talking 95 96 maybe,

304
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,683
maybe even.
Yeah.

305
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,670
95 96 maybe 97 I think
it was 97 and I was,

306
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:41,911
yeah,

307
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:46,911
it was 97 because I was working in
the training department and I was into

308
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,340
Jujitsu.
What else?

309
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,950
I was a blue belch and I wanted
to go and train with Hixon. Right,

310
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:54,990
because if you don't know anything
about Hixon for those people that aren't

311
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,830
Jujitsu players, Hixon is the, the,

312
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,940
he is considered to be the best ever
at Jujitsu and be above and beyond just

313
00:19:09,271 --> 00:19:10,560
being the best ever.

314
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:15,030
Hixon Gracie being considered
the best ever at the sport.

315
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,240
He has a high level of mystique about him.

316
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,910
And you know, there's a bunch
of reasons for that mystique.

317
00:19:25,911 --> 00:19:29,370
And there's a great story
and you know where I don't,

318
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,540
you know the story when the, the guy
from Japan challenged him. Yes. Yeah.

319
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,410
So guy from Japan, he beat one guy
in Japan and his teammates said,

320
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,760
I will fight you at any time.

321
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,240
The guy came to Hickson's academy and
challenged him to a fight and Hixon wasn't

322
00:19:45,421 --> 00:19:46,890
there at the time. They
called, texted and said, hey,

323
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:49,830
this guy from Japan's here to challenge
your honor, Hickson is like, oh,

324
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:53,250
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
So Hixon came down,

325
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,420
they wanted to record it and he said, no,
you can't you. He goes, I will record it.

326
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,510
I will own the video and,
and we will fight now.

327
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,240
And Hixon annihilated him.
And that's one of the mystique source.

328
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:08,710
And actually the guy came back a little
while later and brought him a show gun

329
00:20:08,711 --> 00:20:10,950
helmet and a Samurai sword
or something like that.

330
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,430
There's some drama before that though,
I think the guy went back and was like,

331
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:18,390
Yay him. And like a bunch of people
beat me or a bunch of you owe me up.

332
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,590
And they reported it and then thumb high,
I forget the details,

333
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:26,660
but somehow he was persuaded
to tell the truth. Yeah,

334
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,840
well they had a video of it.

335
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:31,140
Hickson Hickson actually out
of it in that video exists.

336
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,240
It's still the guy told the truth
and then it was, it was cool.

337
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,620
And the other thing that's crazy.
Well,

338
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:42,621
the other thing that adds to the mystique
of Hixon is that everybody that rolls

339
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:47,920
with them every week, multiple
times, five times, six times,

340
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:52,300
seven time world champion, Jujitsu
person rolls with them and they say,

341
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,500
I was helpless.

342
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:59,150
Like guys that are winning dominating
the world championships or saying,

343
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,360
you know,
he,

344
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,170
I was helpless and he's above and beyond
anybody else that I've ever rolled with.

345
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,820
So in,
you know,

346
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:11,821
Hickson's now probably 50 something
and he does not like rolling with the,

347
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,790
the competitive black belts
anymore. Uh, but this is, you know,

348
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,120
five years, no, maybe 10 years ago he was,

349
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,860
he was doing that and he wouldn't compete,

350
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:23,080
but the guys would come to train
with him and he'd destroy him.

351
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,400
And there's some great stories online
that a bunch of really good black belts

352
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,700
have said. I mean, really good
black belts have said, you know,

353
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,620
I was rolling with Hickson
and he just annihilated me.

354
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,510
So this is for me. You
know, I was a blue belt,

355
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:40,510
but it was a pretty good blue belt, you
know? Sure. A day from back in the day.

356
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:44,560
And this is the beautiful thing, you
know, I was at, I was at seal team one.

357
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,760
And so there's something to military,
you can get no cost orders, meaning, Hey,

358
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,170
you don't have to take leave,

359
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:53,410
but we'll give you orders to go somewhere
and we're not going to pay for it

360
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,670
because you know,
we don't,

361
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:57,550
we're not going to waste government money
or spend government money on what you

362
00:21:57,551 --> 00:22:00,580
want to do, but we'll let you go
do it. So I got no cost orders,

363
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:04,960
basically seal team one said, hey, you
can go up and train. And so I did that.

364
00:22:04,961 --> 00:22:09,850
This is at the old Pecos street
academy broken and it was weird.

365
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:14,440
And the Pico Street Academy
was kind of a um, a, um,

366
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,130
it was like a dance studio or something
where they would lay down mats.

367
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,320
And I went up there, I think, I think I
ended up staying up there for nine days.

368
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,710
I stayed at some crappy
hotel around the corner. And

369
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,280
when I got there, Hixon wasn't teaching.
So I go there and I, you know, hey,

370
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,060
I want to train. And the guy
that was there lemole who's,
uh, you know who that is,

371
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:40,210
right? Yeah, it was a heroine hedos.

372
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,770
What's his last name? Oh, I don't, I just
don't have the slip. It's a little wall,

373
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,430
right. So lemme awesome Jujitsu guy,
awesome black belt. And then, you know,

374
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:51,310
Hicks and Gracie black belt. And so
he's teaching and he's, you know,

375
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,850
and I was coming from
Fabio Santos who's a,

376
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:57,190
another Hixon black belt and you know,
my,

377
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,850
my original instructor in Jujitsu where,
you know,

378
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,710
he made all kinds of incredible Jujitsu
guys. Fabio did, you know, you got it.

379
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,630
Just all kinds. Greg trained,
Dean Higgs, James Craig called.

380
00:23:08,631 --> 00:23:12,910
I mean all kinds of really good
high level guys coming out of Fabio.

381
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,283
And then there's a whole,

382
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,440
there's like another generation of black
belts or came out of Fabio too who are

383
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:21,790
all awesome Guy Tino and just a
bunch of really good guy. Eric.

384
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,170
Um,
anyways,

385
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,400
limo was another Hixon black belt and
he was sort of the instructor at the

386
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:30,880
school. So we, I get up there
and I'm taking the classes.

387
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,430
He teaches two classes a day
or maybe three classes a day.

388
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:35,890
So I'm just taking three classes a
day while he's teaching, you know,

389
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:37,720
one's in the day and he
has one in the afternoon,

390
00:23:37,721 --> 00:23:40,240
he has one at night and I'm taking all
the classes and I'm learning, you know,

391
00:23:40,241 --> 00:23:43,900
his style. And at this time,
honestly the styles weren't.

392
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:45,630
If you go to a different
school now you can,

393
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,190
there's a little bit more variance in
styles between schools at this time, man,

394
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:52,480
it was all closer to the source,
right? So all the styles were,

395
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,340
so it was closer to now.

396
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,070
Now we're actually getting beyond that
because now with youtube and everything

397
00:23:58,071 --> 00:23:59,930
and everyone competing
so much all the time,

398
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,640
there's a much quicker transfer of energy.
But five years ago, eight years ago,

399
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,120
when you went to a different school,
that was a much different style.

400
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,770
But at this time, 20 years
ago there was, there was,

401
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,080
you know, it all came from the same
source. So it was much more similar.

402
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,410
So what I'm going to these classes to
three times a day and there there's a 10,

403
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:28,820
15 people, you know, and they're good. You
know, we're all probably about the same.

404
00:24:28,821 --> 00:24:31,640
You know, he, there might've been a
purple belt or two and Lamar was awesome.

405
00:24:31,641 --> 00:24:35,210
Super Cool Guy, real casual guy. And
so that's what the classes were like,

406
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:35,991
super casual.

407
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:39,320
We'd lay out the mats on the wooden
floor and the dance studio and then we'd,

408
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,430
we'd train and shoot the breeze. Kind of
like a Jiu Jitsu class, just laid back,

409
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:47,840
little stretch, maybe learn a move or two,
had some roles, little bit more relaxed.

410
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:52,730
Fabio, Fabio Santos runs ease more old
school and more regimented. You know,

411
00:24:52,731 --> 00:24:54,410
Fabio,
you're going to get in there,

412
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:57,410
you're gonna do your warm up and then
you're going to learn some moves and then

413
00:24:57,411 --> 00:25:01,370
you're going to train. Um, lemme was
a little bit more laid back. Cool.

414
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:03,440
Chill teaching,
really good stuff.

415
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,690
So that's Monday and then Tuesday and
then Wednesday and then, and then limo.

416
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:11,420
I was, you know, in the
afternoon on or in the evening,

417
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:13,430
on Wednesday or I think it wasn't free.
What day?

418
00:25:13,431 --> 00:25:17,140
What was like Wednesday or Thursday? I
think it was a Wednesday. He's like, hey,

419
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:20,390
Hickson's going to teach tomorrow
night. And I was like, oh, awesome. So,

420
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,080
so I come in Thursday night,
I is,

421
00:25:24,081 --> 00:25:28,310
I'm pulling up in my 1990 whatever,

422
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,260
like Dodge Caravan,
pull up and minivan man.

423
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:38,030
And so there's a cars, more cars.

424
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,380
And I was like, Ooh. So now
I walk in in, it's, it's,

425
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,160
there's people everywhere, right?
It's crowded, it's crowded.

426
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:49,150
It went from like 10 or 12
people in a class. Now we,

427
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,850
there's like a hundred people.
I'm serious.

428
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:57,851
We had to lay out like all these
different mats and everyone is quiet.

429
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,060
No one's talking.
It was,

430
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:07,310
I was doing one day,
so Hickson's there and he's,

431
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:11,090
you know, like in a corner,
you know, just cool, chill.

432
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,420
And he looks at Limo and he,
you know,

433
00:26:14,421 --> 00:26:18,230
gives him like a head nod in the multiple
like, okay, well we're warming up.

434
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:20,660
And I was like, okay. So
everyone gets in the line,

435
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:23,390
they start doing the old school that
you did to work, running in a circle,

436
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,120
silence.
Like no one's saying anything.

437
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:31,121
It's just silence it so you
could feel the presence of Hixon.

438
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,490
There's a hundred people now,

439
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,890
there's 10 times as many
people and everyone's quiet.

440
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,050
Everyone's serious.
And then, you know, he,

441
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:46,060
we get done with like a 20 minute up of
stretching and exercise she has getting

442
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:49,050
after it and then he gets done.

443
00:26:49,051 --> 00:26:53,280
He gets us all in a circle and the
circle is huge. And then, you know,

444
00:26:53,281 --> 00:26:58,281
Hixon like walks out into the middle of
the mat and then he sits in the center

445
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,060
and you can hear a pin drop. It was, that
was that. There was that awesome. And,

446
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,710
and then he taught class.
He taught class and I took notes.

447
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,170
Um, and maybe at some point we can go
through all those notes that I took,

448
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:21,171
but there's one of the most important
lessons that I learned about Jujitsu as a

449
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:28,200
whole.
I learned that during that time,

450
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,550
and I actually,
the way Hixon told it,

451
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,740
I've translated into my own way
of saying it, but believe me,

452
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:42,360
it's close. Like it,
what it was, what it is.

453
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,200
Is this, okay. And
you've probably heard me,

454
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,870
I teach this to this day is if,

455
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,100
if you're playing basketball
or you're playing soccer,

456
00:27:53,101 --> 00:27:56,760
I think soccer is what
Hixon used as the example.

457
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,420
If we're playing soccer and I w I
want to or for playing football,

458
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,470
cause you played football. If
I faint to the left, right?

459
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,720
You as a defender you have
to react to me. You, you,

460
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,250
if you don't move to the left,

461
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,640
I'm just going to go left and
you're going to be lost. So,

462
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:20,280
so when I faked to the
left and now you move,

463
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,110
I can quickly adjust back because I'm
one step ahead of you. It was a fake,

464
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:29,220
it wasn't a full commitment.
So I can get by you because,

465
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,890
because when you put your,
when you move your weight,

466
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,500
your weight is a real thing and you
have to place it into the ground.

467
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,910
And when you put your
weight into the ground,

468
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,300
it takes a quarter of a second to pull
that weight back off the ground and put

469
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:43,380
it in the other direction.
So the difference be in Jujitsu.

470
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,910
The guy on the bottom when you fake me,

471
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,050
I don't have to put my weight
anywhere at my, my, my,

472
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,790
my weight does not have to follow you
if you're on the bus with a guy on the

473
00:28:56,791 --> 00:29:01,410
bottom in Jujitsu his way, he doesn't.
If you, if you shuck and Jive my weight,

474
00:29:01,411 --> 00:29:02,520
I don't have to play my weight.
That's what,

475
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,550
it's really hard to like faint one
way and then run the other way.

476
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,230
It doesn't really work. And
you can, you do it. Yeah.

477
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:10,500
But it doesn't work
consistently in Jujitsu.

478
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,100
And so that was this huge lesson
to me that I've always remembered.

479
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:20,890
And W and the other part of it is,
was the hip movement and,

480
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,670
and how to move your hips on the bottom.

481
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,370
And if you don't move your
hips on the bottom, you're,

482
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,460
you're going to get your guard past.

483
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,060
And if you don't control the
hips when you're passing,

484
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:37,740
then you won't be able to pass the guard.
So I have a real,

485
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,830
I had a real focus for a long time of
how to keep my hips mobile on the ground

486
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:43,120
so that people couldn't pass my guard.

487
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,720
And it's something that I
still concentrate on interests.

488
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,390
And when you're passing the guard,
if you,

489
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,910
and again this is another thing you
might hear me tell people like, oh,

490
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:54,280
you got control of my legs.
Cool,

491
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:57,030
you didn't control my hips
and you can control my legs,

492
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,230
you can put pin him on the ground,
I can still move my hips.

493
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:02,410
Eventually it'll be a little
bit more tricky but I can do it.

494
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,230
So those were those two points
that I learned from Hixson.

495
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:13,780
I, I really focused on them
for a long period of time.

496
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,930
And so that was awesome.

497
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,660
And then of course I
rolled with fixing cars.

498
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,420
I was friends with Fabio and Fabio told
them I was going to be there and so he,

499
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,180
you know,
he was a great guy and you know,

500
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,750
rolled with me and like I said,

501
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:33,220
I was a blue belt and I was
a good blue belt. Right.

502
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,590
Meaning what are,
when I rolled with,

503
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:38,800
when I rolled with brown
belts and black belts,

504
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:43,360
which there weren't a lot of at the time,
I did really good. You know what I mean?

505
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:45,970
We were all competitive at,
at Fabio school at that time,

506
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,810
you know us guys that were really
hardcore, cause dean at this time was,

507
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,520
he might've been a blue
belt or a purple belt,

508
00:30:51,521 --> 00:30:54,630
but we were the Guys Hague's was
a purple belt at the time. So,

509
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:59,590
so we were the guys and you know when
guys would come from Brazil off the

510
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,950
competition circuit to come in and
train at Fabio's when they'd stop by,

511
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,530
you know,
those guys would have a brown belts,

512
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:08,200
black belts are going against
dean lister and Higgs.

513
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,840
I mean those guys were not
getting, it was, you know,

514
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,270
Dean and he eggs were awesome.
Dean was phenomenal.

515
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,690
He eggs was phenomenal and I was in
the mix with those guys, you know,

516
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,770
so we were good is what I'm saying. So
what did it feel like to roll with Hixon?

517
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,370
I thought about this and I thought
about a way to describe it.

518
00:31:27,371 --> 00:31:32,200
And this is the way I am going to describe
it. It's going to be hard to imagine,

519
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,580
but try and imagine it. Okay. Hey,

520
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,960
if you ever felt very quick,

521
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:42,510
a large amount of very quickly
rolling water or flowing water. Yes.

522
00:31:42,511 --> 00:31:45,970
So a river,
a giant hose,

523
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:50,200
a pipe with water like coming out of it.
And when you stick your hand,

524
00:31:50,201 --> 00:31:53,050
like you can't barely resist it,
that much water.

525
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,920
So imagine that feeling of force,

526
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,200
but it's not going fast. It's
going slow. It just, it don't,

527
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:07,120
you can't stop it and wherever,
but just like water.

528
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:11,050
So it's like that much force. But just
like water, wherever you go to stop it,

529
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,310
it just goes around it. And it was
that, that was what, what it was like.

530
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,070
And I'm really,

531
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,160
really just phenomenal Jujitsu.

532
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:23,620
And I mean even at that time
and remembering back to it,

533
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,110
it was a nother level of Jujitsu for sure.

534
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,450
That was was awesome. And now, so
yeah, that's, that's wrong and fix.

535
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:35,350
And I still actually, I got some
mutual friends with Hickson and uh,

536
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,860
I see him occasionally.
And

537
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,900
you know, the, the, the
cool thing about Hixon is

538
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,790
he's got a personality

539
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,973
that

540
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,550
I would love to tell you that he's,
you know,

541
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,610
like a stereotypical peaceful warrior
master that seems content with where he's

542
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,960
ended up in life and with
his experiences in life.

543
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,600
But with Hixon,

544
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,900
I get the feeling that,

545
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:17,890
okay,

546
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,780
he's a guy that fighting is in his blood.

547
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,250
Right. And even though he's a mellow guy
and he has nothing to prove to anybody,

548
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,170
I think, and it, it kind of
feels like the way I feel.

549
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,470
He likes the taste of blood, you
know what I mean? And even though,

550
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,840
even though I'm kind of the same
way, like I feel like, you know,

551
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,180
I'm pretty mellow. I mean, I
don't, I don't have anything,

552
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:50,630
I'm not trying to prove anything to
anybody. I guess maybe I am in some ways,

553
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,740
but I'm pretty mellow.
But I still,

554
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,760
I like the taste of blood
and I love that feeling of

555
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:03,560
combat.
And that's kind of what you said.

556
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,830
That's what I sense from
Hickson and so, yeah. Awesome.

557
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:11,550
And maybe we'll have him on here sometime.

558
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,270
Hixon grace. He does have that mystique
though. That's it is crazy how that is,

559
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,900
you know, and it's because it's
real. Yeah. It because it's real.

560
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,170
You can go and like I said,

561
00:34:22,171 --> 00:34:26,640
Google Hixon Gracie stories or
Hixon Gracie black belt stories.

562
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:30,510
There's stories where he would
line up 10 black belts and say,

563
00:34:30,511 --> 00:34:33,930
I'm going to submit you all have
with an arm lock on your right arm.

564
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,520
And he would do it and he
would do it. And that's,

565
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,950
and so the, yeah, that build you
some mystique for sure. Yup. Yes.

566
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,880
I, one time I went, I was
going to film with him,

567
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:52,910
just like a quick video clip with me and
Halleck flew into crones academy Kron

568
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,203
Gracie Academy.

569
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,180
And so I get there and he's there already,
you know,

570
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,730
and he had, so guys were
leaving, they were done training,

571
00:35:02,731 --> 00:35:04,350
guys were leaving and Hallux like,
Hey,

572
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:07,800
I'm going to be like 45
minutes to an hour late.

573
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,730
So it's just me and Nick's in there
and the whole like, everyone's gone.

574
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,880
So he's like, yeah, I was
like, oh yeah, no, I was there
to film. I would have been,

575
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:22,410
hey, you got your geezer? He
had his pants on. Oh, scared.

576
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,050
I submitted to the mystique.
But no, we're uh, you know,

577
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,020
we were waiting for a helicase. Oh Yeah,
how lucky me later, whatever. He was like,

578
00:35:31,021 --> 00:35:33,330
yeah, yeah, I know. He, he told
me or whatever. So he's like,

579
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,170
he's kind of just there looking at me.
So we just sit down.

580
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:41,040
I got to talk to Hexion for like 15
minutes, just about whatever, you know.

581
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,690
And he's kind of looking at me like as
if to say like, so what, uh, you know,

582
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,420
who are you and what do we do? All
cool. But he was still Hicks and Gracie,

583
00:35:48,421 --> 00:35:51,150
so my mind kept while we were talking,

584
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:56,140
my mind kept going into like jumping
outside of my brain and thinking I could

585
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,620
look what you're doing right
now you're sitting with Hixon.

586
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,140
You know how like after we roll
and we don't have anywhere to be,

587
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:04,320
we'll be just talking about stuff. He's
sitting there. Most people. That's how,

588
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,550
and I was doing that with Hixon Gracie,
that just me and him Bro. That's crazy.

589
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:11,220
Right? I mean, you know,
as a, as someone who knew,

590
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:14,710
I know who that is from the beginning,
even before I even started. You did sue.

591
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:19,500
I know who that is. Yeah. So yeah,
man. I was like, how I was funny too,

592
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,890
his bed that night,
back in the day he brought,

593
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,700
he brought his sons with him as well.
Hawkson was there and chrome was there.

594
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,610
Corn was a little kid, man, tiny kid.

595
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:33,720
And Fabio told him that I was in the seal
teams and stuff and that's, you know,

596
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:37,780
so he told me he had a
little conversation. That's
another funny thing. He said,

597
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,490
so when are we got done rolling?
And we were talking like yours are saying,

598
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,740
and he says to me, he
goes, you know, so hey,

599
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,010
they don't affect your role whenever he
goes. Yeah. He said, uh, you're, you're,

600
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,510
you're very comfortable in bad
positions. Right. Right off.

601
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,610
I'll take it, I'll take
it. It's, I do this too.

602
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:03,300
Sometimes when people used to ask me,
hey, what was it like rolling with x?

603
00:37:03,301 --> 00:37:06,300
And I'd say, okay, let me get your
guard. And then I'd get in their garden.

604
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,710
They'd say,
okay now and then I'd say,

605
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,240
okay now just relax and let me pass
and then I would just pass their garden

606
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,090
mountain. I said that's what
it feels like. That excellent,

607
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,020
very comfortable in bed.

608
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:22,260
That's kind of like after you
like box a guy and you say, hey,

609
00:37:22,261 --> 00:37:23,610
you can take punches. Right. Good.

610
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,200
Basically your face is tough
and that's another fear.

611
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,110
I mean I kind of held onto that like
I always like to be comfortable in bad

612
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:32,460
positions.
Dean,

613
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,390
it's really good because when I turned
with dean all the time and so you know,

614
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,830
there's no one that that I roll with
on a regular basis at a roll with some

615
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:44,700
really good guys.

616
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:49,110
But when Dean is mounted on you or
when Dean is on side control on you,

617
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,080
it is insufferable,
bad position.

618
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:59,640
And especially because like I'll roll
with I role with other really high level

619
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:03,270
guys that aren't from our school.
And when I roll with them,

620
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,530
if they get a position like that,

621
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:09,750
they don't know exactly my every
little escape. Dean knows exactly.

622
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:12,870
He knows, he knows all 14 of
my escapes. He knows them all.

623
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:16,260
So you're more trapped on more trout.
And it's the same with him.

624
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,350
When I get to position I know
what he's going to do. I know.

625
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:22,200
And so he and I joke
about it, you know, eat,

626
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:27,390
neither one of us want the other
person to be, especially across side,

627
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,400
you know, and we don't want that. So

628
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,170
I guess that's an accident. Acid in
boxing too, if you can take punches.

629
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,740
Oh for sure. He's comfortable
in bad positions in Jujitsu.

630
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,080
Is is Kinda like back when
you were talking about the,

631
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,560
when you're in water and things
are going bad, dark panic.

632
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,610
If you're comfortable in bad positions,
like you have the ability to yeah,

633
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:51,460
to not panic. And that helps so
much because when you panic you gas,

634
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,590
Hey, do you make stupid
mistakes and Jujitsu, you
make stupid mistakes, so yeah,

635
00:38:55,591 --> 00:38:58,530
man, I'm just going to push this leg out
of here. Oh, now he's grabbing my arm.

636
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:03,020
Yeah. Yeah. He wanted you to do
that. That's good compliment.

637
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,530
Next question.
In podcasts,

638
00:39:06,531 --> 00:39:11,450
50 for the Armed Forces officer, remember
that book? Their Armed Forces officer?

639
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:15,180
Yeah. One of my feet. 1950 edition. Yeah.

640
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,810
Can you expound on the
difference between these two?

641
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,860
These two seemingly contradictory
quotes from the manual,

642
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:27,890
affirm hold at the beginning pays 10
fold dividend of the timid approach

643
00:39:27,891 --> 00:39:32,600
followed by a show of firmness later on
from general Malone story of a World War

644
00:39:32,601 --> 00:39:33,420
One

645
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:35,130
compared with and General Malone's.

646
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:39,730
If you remember the story was there's
mad messed up unit and he went in there.

647
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:42,270
It was like, all right, get squared
away. Get these boards in place,

648
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:44,940
get out of the mud. What you need
to get your uniforms together.

649
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:48,290
Just tighten them up out of the gate
like firmness right from this way out of

650
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,960
the gate and then compare it

651
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:52,750
two. Okay. Here's the quote.

652
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:57,550
It's a mistake for an officer on taking
a new post to order sweeping changes

653
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,970
affecting the other man in the belief
that this will give him a reputation for

654
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:02,410
action and firmness.

655
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,360
The studying of situations is the
overture of the steadying of it,

656
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,973
and that's from general

657
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,530
in general. We're May, if you
remember that one, he said, hey,

658
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:17,400
none of you guys would be
in these positions unless
you were doing things right.

659
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,250
So I assume that you're doing a good job
and we're going to continue what you're

660
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,720
doing.
That's what he said when he took over.

661
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:25,110
So what's going on here is you've got
two completely different situations and

662
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:29,520
the two situations are,
one is a guy taking over first situation,

663
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:33,330
a known bad situation.
The troops are lacking discipline.

664
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:36,300
They're not executing the mission.
If you remember for that story,

665
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,970
they weren't even doing basic
military bearing. They didn't,

666
00:40:38,971 --> 00:40:40,380
they weren't saluting the officers.

667
00:40:40,381 --> 00:40:42,480
They just hadn't thrown
everything out the window.

668
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,360
That's a situation where you got to come
in, you got to get from out of the gate.

669
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:49,260
That's what you gotta do.
Now they got to know that.

670
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,710
They got to know that things are gonna
Change. They got to know it's real.

671
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,230
They got to know there's a new plan and
I got to know what that new plan is and

672
00:40:58,231 --> 00:41:00,240
then they got to know that there's new
standards and they got to know what the

673
00:41:00,241 --> 00:41:05,220
new standards are. Boom. And it's the same
thing. You know, Hackworth. He did that.

674
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,390
He came in with some, you know, if
you remember when he took over the,

675
00:41:08,391 --> 00:41:10,890
the hardcore battalion,
what became the hardcore battalion,

676
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,730
the first thing he did was like all those
radios and guitars and all this crap

677
00:41:14,731 --> 00:41:15,930
that you have sitting around base.

678
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,110
Put it all in the middle of the base
tomorrow and we're getting rid of it all.

679
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,640
That was a big change.
Now Hackworth.

680
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,680
Then he, then he started implementing
two changes a day. If you remember,

681
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,140
hey gotta get everyone can
carry your weapon at all times.

682
00:41:31,141 --> 00:41:34,800
That's the neck change. Okay,
get your helmet. Now we've
got to get helmet covers.

683
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:35,860
When he just made one,

684
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,010
one or two small changes a day after he
made some big sweeping changes out of

685
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:43,880
the gate because it was a
jacked up battalion and now,

686
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:45,260
now the differences,

687
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:50,420
if you're going into a situation where
everything's going fine or okay or at a

688
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:52,010
bare minimum it's like normal,

689
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,790
well then you don't need to step in there
and show that you're have a manned by

690
00:41:55,791 --> 00:41:59,780
making these sweeping changes. You
don't need to do that. It comes across,

691
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:03,920
it comes across like the people that you
just took charge of have no idea what

692
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:07,730
they're doing and get you don't, you
don't respect what they did, what they,

693
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,640
what their methodology.
You don't respect their,

694
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,240
their performance because you're coming
in and saying, oh, echo, by the way,

695
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,330
the way you report cord, the podcast,
you need to get rid of those microphones.

696
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:20,030
You need to edit it tighter your basis to,
you know,

697
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,710
what would you be thinking
if I came in and said that?

698
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,100
Well,
you know

699
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,950
me a little bit different, but you know,
I understand your pain point being.

700
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,310
If somebody comes in and
starts criticizing you
right when you do it. Okay.

701
00:42:33,311 --> 00:42:36,160
When you're doing a good job, we
know you're doing a good job. Yeah,

702
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,020
I think you're doing a good job.

703
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,720
There's something that I get on you about
that base. Occasionally that's your,

704
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:45,840
that's really on you. You know
you're blocking your base. But yeah,

705
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,660
so that's the thing. If that's the
decision you gotta make, and guess what?

706
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,560
It's not black and white.
You don't go into some units.

707
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,800
It's not like you're going to get a choice
between a unit that's doing horrible

708
00:42:59,801 --> 00:43:01,120
and a unit that's doing great.

709
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:04,750
You're going to get every thing in
between and therefore you have to modulate

710
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,300
your leadership to reflect.
If it's a,

711
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,960
if it's a group that might have a tendency
of being a little bit jacked up and

712
00:43:10,961 --> 00:43:13,630
they're getting close, guess
what? Gotta gotta gotta beat.

713
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,020
Maybe not sweeping changes, but you might
need to make a little statement, right?

714
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,210
If it's a group that's performing
awesome, fantastic top, top team,

715
00:43:22,211 --> 00:43:24,430
top, whatever, you might need
to come and say, hey guys,

716
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:25,510
I see that you're doing great.

717
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,490
I'm here to just keep you
guys doing what you're doing.

718
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,550
Let me know what you need to support.
Boom.

719
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:33,790
And it could be anywhere
in between that spectrum.

720
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:36,130
That's why leadership is challenging,

721
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,520
cause you gotta be able to got to have
nuance. You gotta be able to modulate.

722
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:43,930
Yeah. You gotta figure out where that
is and you've got to test it out to,

723
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:46,990
once you give that sweeping order,
you've got to see what kind of reaction.

724
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:48,023
Gotcha.

725
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,210
You know, you've got to see two
people just instantly rebel. Okay.

726
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:54,670
Then let's talk this. Let's get
some feedback. What's going on?

727
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,510
Clearly we have a disrespect scenario
going on. When you get to bottom of this,

728
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,030
let me get some key leaders in here.
Let me talk to them, get some feedback,

729
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,060
which you should do that before you
make any sweeping changes anyway.

730
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,510
He got to at least talk to the key
leadership. Get them in the game.

731
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,160
Get them on board. Yeah. That's why
leadership is awesome. That's why I beat,

732
00:44:12,161 --> 00:44:14,260
that's why this stuff is so
fun because it's challenging.

733
00:44:14,261 --> 00:44:17,900
It's different every single
time it feels like, um,

734
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:22,210
kinda like what we were talking about
earlier where if you start to understand

735
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:23,050
the formula,

736
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,440
all the different details that come out
and you can kind of apply the formula in

737
00:44:26,441 --> 00:44:29,170
one way and even then still
dynamic, but, but you can,

738
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,950
you can just get a better grass.
Just like Jujitsu.

739
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,150
If you understand the concept that
you have to be able to move your hips,

740
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:38,260
there's a bunch of different ways
you can get your hips moving, right?

741
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,730
If you understand the concept that you
need to mobilize the hips to pass the

742
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,170
guard,
if you understand that concept,

743
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:44,400
there's all kinds of
different ways you can do it.

744
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,490
If you understand the concept of totally
jacked up team is going to need a

745
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:53,070
sweeping change to get their attention
and get them to understand that things

746
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:54,990
are gonna change and what they
were doing was unacceptable.

747
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,230
If you understand that concept,
that that's what it's going to take,

748
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:02,430
you can apply it all the way through those
gradiations all the way down to, hey,

749
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,590
this team is doing great and
I don't need to change much.

750
00:45:04,591 --> 00:45:08,970
I just need to give them the support
that they need. Conceptual instruction,

751
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,160
very important.
That's what Jocko,

752
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,840
I recently listened to the strategic
con podcast while on my way to coach

753
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:23,841
Lacrosse and I was impressed how many
of the points made between both Maurice

754
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,030
and your experience as an operator
translated into the field.

755
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:32,250
Another point of the cast that stuck
out and now I reflect on as learning

756
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:36,840
experience and coachable moment for
myself was the saying of good work.

757
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,990
When we recently battled through uh, uh,
the first half we game lacrosse game,

758
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,160
it was a grudge match in
this one he's talking,

759
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:49,710
I edited a little bit out of this
because he had a really long email and we

760
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,030
believe in brevity around here.

761
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:55,080
So he's actually now talking about a
soccer match grudge match, set their plan.

762
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,990
Okay. So boom, they had a hard first
half. It was a grudge match. Uh,

763
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:00,570
I'm very evenly played until,

764
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,220
until the half when I told the boys they
were doing good work out there and that

765
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:07,500
we were matching their intensity
and putting pressure on them.

766
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:12,300
Then the first 30 seconds of the second
half we were scored on due to lack of

767
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:16,440
intensity and follow through. I suspect
it may have been from my good job,

768
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,790
quote unquote good work. Keep it up
talk we had in the inn at the halftime.

769
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,200
My question to you is how
does one reinforce the fact
they were hitting hard up

770
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:28,644
there?

771
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,340
Give them some words of encouragement
and send them back out without taking a

772
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:36,660
hit in intensity as the coach of freshmen
high school boys who are basically

773
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:39,510
wild dogs and need direction plus support,

774
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:43,690
what could I have done different to keep
the intensity up in the second half and

775
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,840
even after getting scored on?
So this is,

776
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,850
this is pretty simple and I've
actually talked about this before. Um,

777
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,930
I've talked about it with regards to MMA
and I've talked about it with regards

778
00:46:54,931 --> 00:46:58,290
to my seal platoon,
my seal task unit.

779
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,790
And that is that you have to be very
careful with praise. Oh yeah, yeah.

780
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Because in the example that I give in
the corner of MMA fights is if you tell

781
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:10,890
the guy, hey, good job. You know
you're, well, you won that last round.

782
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,780
Keep just keep doing what you're
doing. He's going to back off. Yeah,

783
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:17,760
he's going to back off. And guess
what the other corners telling him,

784
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,330
you lost that round. You need to step
it up. You need to get aggressive.

785
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:22,410
And that's what they're going to do.

786
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,040
They're going to get out
there because I'll tell you,

787
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:30,010
most people in an MMA fight,
MMA fight is a, it's like

788
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,370
wrestling. It's a very intense
cardio activity. You're good.

789
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,850
Everybody's going to be tired, beat
just about everybody. I mean obviously.

790
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,850
So when you get two guys will,
let me, let me rephrase that.

791
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:42,790
When you get two guys that are evenly
matched and are going at it hard,

792
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,940
they're both going to be tired and so
they're going to want a little bit of

793
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:46,330
arrest.

794
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,380
So if you give them that opportunity to
back off the throttle just a little bit,

795
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,930
subconsciously they're going to do it
because they think they're doing good.

796
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:57,730
They think that one that last round, so
you can see that all the time. You see,

797
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:02,560
I mean, it happened, it happened with
Rhonda. You know, they're saying, hey,

798
00:48:02,561 --> 00:48:06,730
good job, good job. You're looking
good. And she's getting crushed.

799
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:11,650
I mean, that's kind of a
bad example. But anyways,

800
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,430
you gotta be careful that in,
in, I've told this story before,

801
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:18,990
but when my tasking was going
through training and uh,

802
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,810
we will doing CQC, so close
quarters, combat drills,

803
00:48:22,811 --> 00:48:26,080
we're going in to kill house
over and over and you know,

804
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,090
we broke for lunch or something.

805
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:32,890
We come back from lunch and the guy
that is the Kadri, they're like, hey,

806
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,270
you guys are kicking ass. This is great.
Keep it up. You guys are two best task.

807
00:48:37,271 --> 00:48:40,000
You know, we've seen out of
here. You guys are crushing it.

808
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:43,870
And literally the next run guys go in
the house, they screw everything up,

809
00:48:43,871 --> 00:48:47,110
they miss targets, just a disaster.
And I talked to the contrary. I'm like,

810
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:51,120
don't ever tell my guys again that they're
the best guys in the world. Don't ask,

811
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,440
don't tell them that you
can tell him good job,

812
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:57,280
but don't be telling them they're
the best people in the world.

813
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,000
Just doesn't work. And so that's
kind of what happened. You know here.

814
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,800
Now the thing is,

815
00:49:02,801 --> 00:49:05,620
this doesn't mean that you can never
give anybody credit or never give anyone

816
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:08,920
praise because you absolutely have
to do that. But what you have to do,

817
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:13,921
you have to proactively counteract the
mental lapse in intensity that's about to

818
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:19,120
take place because you just compliment
them. So how do you do that?

819
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:25,750
So let's say you're on the
lacrosse field or the soccer field,

820
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:30,070
you bring the boys in. You
say, look guys, good half good.

821
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,450
First half of you took it to them.

822
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,210
You showed them that we can hang with
them. You played him even. That's fine.

823
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,960
Here's a problem.
Even isn't good enough.

824
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,920
We need to get out there and play harder.

825
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:48,970
We need to step it up. I actually
want you guys to play like murderers.

826
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:51,460
That's what I want you to do.
I want you to win every loose ball.

827
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,290
I want you to make every tackle.

828
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,780
I want you to get your head on
every ball that's in the air.

829
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:00,010
You stick to them on defense. I don't
even want them to be able to breathe.

830
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,750
I want you to work them into the ground.
I want pressure, pressure, upfront,

831
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:11,810
pressure in the midfield and pressure
on d you make them fight for every inch,

832
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:13,890
every ball,
and every breath.

833
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,920
I want you to go out there
and take their souls.

834
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:23,170
So you got to counter that. You know,
you got to counter the good job thing.

835
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:26,230
So in MMA it's the same thing.
You know, hey, good round.

836
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,690
Who was a close but a good round. But
listen, you can't let up right now.

837
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:33,870
You need to step it up. He knows he
has to step it up. I'm telling you,

838
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,240
he knows he's got to step it up.
And if you come out week,

839
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,360
he's going to get the upper hand
right away. You need to put him away.

840
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:44,790
You need to go out there and crush him,
crush his soul,

841
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,110
turn it on and put this guy away.

842
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:55,320
I want you to kill him.
So that's what you need to do with that.

843
00:50:55,321 --> 00:50:58,690
Now for tactical training.
Same thing. Cause you know,

844
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:02,190
I know this police officer's and Swat
teams and t and guys that are in the

845
00:51:02,191 --> 00:51:02,671
military,

846
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:06,030
you're doing tactical training all the
time and you're going to see that as the

847
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:09,300
team comes together, they're going
to start to do good. But like I said,

848
00:51:09,301 --> 00:51:13,350
if you give them too much,
they're going to slack, right?

849
00:51:13,351 --> 00:51:17,810
So you know when you're running your
tactical training, you for your guys,

850
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:20,970
you say, look, hey guys, I see
some good progress out there.

851
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:22,080
We're making some good runs.

852
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,820
But let me tell you it's not good
enough for it right now. Okay,

853
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:32,790
this is the deal. The enemy can rely on
luck. We can't, we rely on our training.

854
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:38,190
We trained to be prepared for
anything that the enemy throws at us.

855
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:42,360
So we're going to work as hard as
we can and be as perfect as we can.

856
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,990
So we are ready for the
worst case scenario.

857
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:48,180
So get jacked up for
another run right now.

858
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:53,930
And I want you to go in there like a band
of bloodthirsty viking shock troops on

859
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,680
our damn berserker rage and crush this.

860
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:03,550
So you want to bring that
kind of counts right?

861
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,540
And then in combat again,

862
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:12,340
and I just was talking to some guys
yesterday and it's the same thing where

863
00:52:12,341 --> 00:52:17,341
complacency is the worst thing that can
happen with your team when you're in a

864
00:52:17,741 --> 00:52:20,650
combat scenario. So what were your
combat? You know, it's look, hey guys,

865
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,470
we're running some good operations,
right?

866
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:26,230
We got the upper hand and that's good,

867
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,340
but it's not good enough.

868
00:52:29,341 --> 00:52:34,341
We cannot be complacent and we can't
take our foot off the enemy's throat.

869
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,400
We are going to be relentless.

870
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:42,420
We are not going to give
him the chance to regroup.

871
00:52:42,421 --> 00:52:47,310
He will not get the chance to recover.
There will be no downtime for the enemy.

872
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:48,173
And I'll tell you what,

873
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,330
I don't even want the enemy to
have a chance to bury their dead.

874
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,700
We are not going to stop until there is
nothing left to pursue and no one left

875
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:03,060
to bury. So sharpen up your
knives, load up your magazines,

876
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:07,740
because we got work to do.
So again,

877
00:53:07,741 --> 00:53:10,200
we got to counter,
you know,

878
00:53:10,201 --> 00:53:13,560
the compliments and balance.

879
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,580
Essentially what I'm doing in
each one of those situations,

880
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:22,820
I'm balancing the positive affirmations
of what is happening with some new goals

881
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,890
and new objectives that will
ensure that there will be no slack.

882
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:31,303
Yeah,

883
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,250
so the guy said

884
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,550
they were ninth graders. Freshman.
Yeah, freshman wild dogs. Yup.

885
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,970
Yeah.
Next question.

886
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,280
How do you detach without
seeming completely cold?

887
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,200
Okay,
important question.

888
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:00,140
No, I'm saying this all time.
You know, you got to detach.
I also say all the time,

889
00:54:00,141 --> 00:54:01,880
if you detach from all your emotions,

890
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:04,370
that means your robot and people don't
fall robots. I say it all the time.

891
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:07,670
So when you do detach,

892
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,233
you can't,

893
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,560
you can't completely step away.
But if you do,

894
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,880
you have to.
You have to act.

895
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:25,500
You have to do a little
acting. Now, first of all,

896
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,640
we already talked about this, right? We
already talked about these red flags, that

897
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:30,703
debt

898
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,520
show that you're going
to lose your temper,

899
00:54:33,521 --> 00:54:36,010
that you're going to get emotional
about something. You know,

900
00:54:36,011 --> 00:54:39,280
you're clenched fist and you're raised
voice and your heavy breathing and your

901
00:54:39,281 --> 00:54:43,030
flared nostrils and all that stuff,
right? So you know what those things mean.

902
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,900
Those things mean those things are your,
your signal that mean detach. Okay,

903
00:54:46,901 --> 00:54:48,370
so you got to work on that.

904
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:54,790
Now here's the dichotomy of it is once
you are there and once you have detached,

905
00:54:56,481 --> 00:54:59,630
you actually have to now go back

906
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:02,760
and do

907
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:07,350
one or some of those things
that you are trying not to do.

908
00:55:07,351 --> 00:55:09,090
You have to go and you have
to do them a little bit

909
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:15,300
in a nice little controlled manner, right?
Maybe raise your voice a little bit.

910
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:16,623
Hm.

911
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:20,870
Maybe you just kind of clench your jaw
on and you remember I said to you like,

912
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,100
like nodding your head in a positive way.
And that's when you,

913
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:29,240
if you're coming to me with an issue
and I nod my head to the affirmative,

914
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,070
you know, up and down saying,
yes, I understand. Yes,

915
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,360
I understand that's a soothing thing to
your team, right? They see that you're,

916
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,253
you're okay with it.

917
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,490
The opposite of that is when you
shake your head in the negative.

918
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,770
Like if you're telling me some
problem and I'm shaking my head,

919
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:45,610
it's like Amigo and Tim, I can't believe
this is going on. Right. So yeah.

920
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,770
So maybe that's another thing that you,
you,

921
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:51,530
you clench your jaw and you shake your
head. Did you show the person like, look,

922
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:53,000
I know we're in a bad way.
I get it.

923
00:55:53,001 --> 00:55:55,880
I'm not sitting back here like it's no
big deal. I know it's gonna be a tough,

924
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,720
I know we just lost a sale
or I know we just, you know,

925
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,660
I'm going to have to plan another
mission that we just got back.

926
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,990
I understand that it's
hard. You care. I care.

927
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:09,290
You know I'm with you.
You want to give that,

928
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:12,620
maybe you let out that little sigh of
frustration, you know, like a little,

929
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,950
like something like that, right?
Just going to do that little thing.

930
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:20,270
You just do that just so showing that
you do got some emotions and you are

931
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:22,870
invested in all that stuff.
And,

932
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:25,390
and then once,

933
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:30,550
once you see that you've
achieved your goal here,

934
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,260
that you can see that,

935
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,780
that they see that you have some
emotions on the situation, then you,

936
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,270
you quickly get yourself
to recover from that.

937
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:45,250
You get yourself composed and
you've shown them and they,

938
00:56:45,251 --> 00:56:48,040
and they've seen that it's almost like
a little to see like a little weakness

939
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:50,970
and they go, okay, you don't, Tacos
are human related. Yeah, I can relate,

940
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,170
but he's mad. But you know what?
I actually want him to calm down.

941
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,090
I actually am glad he's so good.
Yardi, I'm using two. What?

942
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,920
I'm glad he's calming
down. That's good. Okay,

943
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,210
so the new recover and you go back
to your calm, cool. Collected self,

944
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:07,630
right. That's what we're going
to do now. Like I said, this is,

945
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:12,100
do we call this acting?
I guess maybe we could call it acne,

946
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:16,030
but at the same time acting means
you're trying to pretend to be somebody.

947
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,760
You're not trying to pretend to
be anybody else. You're being you.

948
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:22,960
That's all you're doing. You're being
you. You're just acting like yourself.

949
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,420
Just showing a little bit
more of the emotion. And

950
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:32,710
then you would be if you were
just completely detached.

951
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:36,940
So it's not like you're trying
to act like some, you know,

952
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,450
junior. Yeah. You're not trying to, to,

953
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:41,980
to play a role of someone
else or just being you. So,

954
00:57:41,981 --> 00:57:44,500
and you already know what you
do because you've learned how,

955
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:45,940
what the signals are.

956
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:48,790
So when you know that you raise your
voice and that means you're okay,

957
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:52,040
then you just raise your voice a
little bit. If you know that you,

958
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,510
you just give a little sites.
It's those careful things.

959
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:59,410
And so, yeah, I guess
it is acting in a way,

960
00:57:59,411 --> 00:58:03,970
but it's not full on anybody
can do it, I think. Yeah.

961
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:08,050
Yeah, you did. I think that's
great. This is my opinion.

962
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:12,150
You do it with your kids, you
know? Oh, I mean, I'm like,

963
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:16,390
you got to pretend to act gay. You know,
you're mad or, or whatever. Any good.

964
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:18,850
Even happy,
even pretend to act happy.

965
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:25,780
I needed excellent. Okay. We'll say
excited. Hey, I got something for you.

966
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:30,430
It's a drawing of a happy face.
Same as she did yesterday. You know?

967
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:35,590
And it's like, I'm not the honest truth
is I'm excited about other things.

968
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:38,780
We'll just say that bro.

969
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,440
I'm all those loved all that love
you got for crying about that letter.

970
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:48,800
You're going to, you're going to
know it's all going backwards now.

971
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,430
People are going to hate
you. Now rob talking about
exciting your daughter Josie,

972
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:57,020
a beautiful picture and you don't
care about it. It was cold blooded.

973
00:58:57,050 --> 00:58:59,450
What I'm going to give her
is a lot of excitement.

974
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm going to match her excitement.
Maybe even go one level higher.

975
00:59:02,001 --> 00:59:03,950
That's what I'm going to give her.
So what am

976
00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,660
I'm excited about? A lot of other things
a little bit though, right? It's the same.

977
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:13,560
Same thing. Uh, that was messed
up by the way. Same thing. Yeah,

978
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,980
it's,
is it a form of manipulation?

979
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:19,950
It might be a little bit of a
form of manipulation, but again,

980
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:23,000
if you're doing it to the individual
and you're doing it to help the team,

981
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:26,540
then isn't manipulation or is
it leadership? I say, of course,

982
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:29,150
if leadership you're not
manip manipulation is,

983
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:34,010
I'm trying to fool you so you do things
that I want you to do that we're not

984
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:36,290
doing that.
It's not what we're running here.

985
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,170
All right, next question. Next question.

986
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:47,030
Please discuss how disciplined in one
area doesn't make up for slack in other

987
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:51,610
areas. For example, the fit is
guru who has no savings. Mm.

988
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,420
Yeah.
You know,

989
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:58,100
this is something that we all have to
work out for watch out for is the fact

990
00:59:58,101 --> 01:00:02,570
that we, we focus on our strengths,
right? That's what we do.

991
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:07,070
That's what people do. So you get
a person that's smart, you know,

992
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:11,270
really intellectual person and they let
themselves go physically, right? Right.

993
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:14,480
You know, or you get a person
that's a physical stud,

994
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:17,900
but then they're not going to
challenge their brain power.

995
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:21,410
Or like the question that was,
you know,

996
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,470
the example here that was posed,
you know,

997
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:27,710
someone that's a fitness guru or a party,
Google who,

998
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm throwing that one out there because
some people really go to that or they,

999
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:34,010
you know,
they're an entrepreneur.

1000
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,760
I'm an entrepreneur and so
they're driving a new Mercedes,

1001
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,380
but it's leased and
they're behind on payments.

1002
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,060
So strategically yet.
Yeah. Yeah. That, um,

1003
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:49,870
so you,
you know,

1004
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,480
I mean you take another example is what
about the business person that doesn't

1005
01:00:53,481 --> 01:00:56,420
have time for their family, right?
Yeah. And so that's not good.

1006
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,940
So I think the focus here is your,

1007
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,150
we try and we all have to be,

1008
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:07,400
try to be well rounded and not focus so
much on one area that you're going to

1009
01:01:07,401 --> 01:01:10,340
let some of that area go. That's
target fixation is what that is, right?

1010
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,330
Is you walk into a room and you get
fixated on one target, one bad guy,

1011
01:01:14,331 --> 01:01:15,710
you think there's one bad guy.

1012
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:18,140
So you focus all your energy
and then you're getting fined.

1013
01:01:18,830 --> 01:01:20,480
That's target fixation.
You can't let that happen.

1014
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:23,090
You can't let it happen on
the battlefield. You can't
let it happen and the life.

1015
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,490
So look out for that when you
do this. Um, and I'll tell you,

1016
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,340
this is actually a reality
of the situation. Um,

1017
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,070
I try and maintain this balance,

1018
01:01:34,071 --> 01:01:39,071
but I've been actually
working a lot lately.

1019
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,731
And what,

1020
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:45,731
and this is a clear indicator to me that
I've overbooked myself is last week we

1021
01:01:49,191 --> 01:01:52,610
had this eye,
we had to skip a day of Jujitsu to record.

1022
01:01:53,990 --> 01:01:57,500
I mean we don't do that right? When did
we record rear corner after Jujitsu.

1023
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:01,730
But I knew I had so much
stuff going on that I said,

1024
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:05,090
hey we gotta we gotta record at this time
because I got to get this other stuff

1025
01:02:05,091 --> 01:02:08,330
done because I'm traveling and this and
that. And so we had to skip those huge,

1026
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:12,350
it's cut. So that is a red
flag to me that says I need to,

1027
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,250
I need to tighten up, I
need to get my, you know,

1028
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,830
get my schedule back in
check so that I can do the,

1029
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:23,070
that I need to do. Of course.
What do I say about the situation?

1030
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:27,150
It's fine. You know what? Can't train
Jiu Jitsu that day cause I'm trying,

1031
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,470
I got some travel coming up.
Good.

1032
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:31,900
I'm going to heal up my shoulder a little
bit more. I'm going to, as you know,

1033
01:02:31,901 --> 01:02:33,150
I'm going to, it's, it's good, it's fine,

1034
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,750
but it is an indicator of when things
start going in the wrong direction.

1035
01:02:39,271 --> 01:02:42,570
Maybe I'm getting target
fixated on you know,

1036
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:47,610
too much work at a certain time,
which to me again,

1037
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:52,260
I will run this thing in the red as you
say. I like, I like running in the red,

1038
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:54,630
right?
I'm in the red and I got no problem.

1039
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:59,720
Like we will go hard in the numbers
of hours I've been where I will work.

1040
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,890
We'll have actually no impact on how
much I'm going to tell them to spend with

1041
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,440
my family and do Jujitsu and all
that stuff cause I'll just do it all.

1042
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,860
But there is a capacity
that you reach where you go,

1043
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:13,470
okay now one of these things
that has just started to slide,

1044
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:18,830
now I need to make sure that
my levels get re re levels,

1045
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,240
I guess you might say equalized
is what I should have said. Uh,

1046
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:28,980
so back to the subject. Don't
be a one trick pony, you know,

1047
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,990
be a jack of all trades and then
master a few of those traits.

1048
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,180
And so you can emphasize fitness guru,

1049
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:39,570
you can emphasize intellectual power,

1050
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,120
you can emphasize Jujitsu,

1051
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:48,590
but don't put 100% of your effort into
one area because eventually it will take

1052
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,900
you, you won't have anything else. And by
the way, if you put all your, you know,

1053
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:01,680
if you put all your, all your eggs
in the basket of intellectual power,

1054
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,520
now you're unhealthy and you die,
right? That, that doesn't, you know,

1055
01:04:05,521 --> 01:04:09,690
I don't care how smart you are, you
can't do two plus two when you're dead.

1056
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:16,460
So don't put all your
focus 100% into one area.

1057
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:21,710
Don't become unbalanced in
your disciplines is spread
it around and hold the

1058
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:22,970
line.
Yeah man.

1059
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:28,150
Good. Yeah. Again, it kind of feels like,

1060
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:33,230
like he can be understood that,
um,

1061
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:39,090
say I'm real good at, I
dunno, fitness [inaudible]

1062
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:44,360
and it's easy to justify yourself. You
know, like your, your, let's say, okay,

1063
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:49,010
I'm real good at fitness, fitness
guru. And I go around and then I see,

1064
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:49,401
I don't know,

1065
01:04:49,401 --> 01:04:54,230
I go to the store or go to some party
and I see this other guy who's like

1066
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:58,280
socially,
he's just hundred percent everyone likes,

1067
01:04:58,281 --> 01:05:02,450
he's such a nice careers. Madec I
makes a lot of money in all this stuff,

1068
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,500
but he's not in that good a shape for,
I don't know. He smokes and whatever,

1069
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:08,900
you know, it's ease. I
think a lot of people,

1070
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,783
whoa,

1071
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,140
it feels like it's easy to justify wolf
that guys in bad shape. So who cares?

1072
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:17,170
I really didn't want any of that. I
wouldn't want all the money. You know,

1073
01:05:17,171 --> 01:05:18,004
all this stuff.

1074
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:22,810
It seems like you had to justify and
he north the other guy saying, yeah,

1075
01:05:22,811 --> 01:05:27,100
you might be in good shape. Guessing
what? They're nice Toyota Corolla.

1076
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:29,860
You're driving these all
negative on him. Yeah. Yeah.

1077
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:34,660
So both those guys should, it should,
instead of saying, Hey, you know what?

1078
01:05:34,661 --> 01:05:36,280
They should do, walk up
and be like, hey man,

1079
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:38,260
you know what I noticed were
pretty successful financially.

1080
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:41,610
I would like to get in the
game with you a little bit and,

1081
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:45,190
and learn from you about that. And
the other guy should say to him, well,

1082
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:48,370
you know what? It looks like you're
in pretty good fitness levels.

1083
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:50,500
I would like to get in the game with that.

1084
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,540
Let's work together and improve ourselves
and go out and kick ass and dominate.

1085
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:59,890
Are you in? I'm in. Let's do this instead.

1086
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:04,150
What does a normal person do? They do
exactly what you said. Justify, criticize,

1087
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,260
cut people down instead
of building them up. Yeah.

1088
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:12,580
And what you have to be careful of, if I
was to go to you and say, hey, you know,

1089
01:06:12,581 --> 01:06:17,290
echo, I got a lot of money. I can tell
you don't have a lot. I'll help you out.

1090
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:19,690
That's, that can be offensive to
some people because you think,

1091
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:22,610
do you think you are? Yeah. You
can sit back and read your hell.

1092
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:25,720
I'm going to worry about money.
I think I'm worried about money.

1093
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:29,860
When I got abs like,
Yo,

1094
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:34,000
so what we have to do is instead of,
if I came to you and said, echo dude,

1095
01:06:34,001 --> 01:06:37,780
I want abs like you got,
can you help me get in the game?

1096
01:06:37,810 --> 01:06:40,420
And then we formed a little
relationship and now I say to you, man,

1097
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:45,010
so what do you got? What's your, what's
your main income stream dude? You know,

1098
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:47,350
what are you doing? And you say, well,
you know, I've got these two clients.

1099
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:51,080
If you've got a website, no, not
really. Why don't you have a website?

1100
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:53,000
Do you got any social media
to advertise on? You know,

1101
01:06:53,001 --> 01:06:56,620
when we go though that road and we
build up, we take care of each other.

1102
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,150
So we don't want to do as people

1103
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,290
kind of like you ever
seen the guys who go,

1104
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:04,480
they see like a football player
or something. It'd be like,

1105
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:06,100
I can kick his ass though.
You know,

1106
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:09,170
you know that Kenga got who
can always like some success.

1107
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,070
He kick his ass though.
Yeah.

1108
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:17,590
Well I've told the story
in the seal teams, it's uh,

1109
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,790
no one, no one is good. If, if a guy,

1110
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:25,090
like we have guys in the seal
teams that are literally, you know,

1111
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,740
world class athletes in whatever world,
class triathlete,

1112
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:34,420
world class, sailor worldclass, whatever.

1113
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:38,980
And so, oh you, oh, you're, you're
world class triathlete. Oh yeah.

1114
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:43,390
That guy's really good triathlete.
That's cool. He's a really bad shot.

1115
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,570
Someone who's going to chime in and
cut them down and just the way it goes.

1116
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:51,370
No slack, no slack. Slack. Right.

1117
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:57,010
We'll go one more I think so, uh, Jocko,

1118
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:02,980
would you confront an individual team
member when reported by other team members

1119
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:06,130
that they're talking smack about you?
Or would you just ignore

1120
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,110
the old classic here?
What do you do about the,

1121
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,010
about the negative guy
that's trying to bring you

1122
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,480
and sure you can,

1123
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:25,520
you can confront them right?
And you can, by doing that,

1124
01:08:25,521 --> 01:08:30,140
join in there in their little game
in,

1125
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:33,650
in doing that,
you give them the satisfaction.

1126
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:37,460
They now know that they,
they got into your head

1127
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:42,890
and then you're turning your
workplace into, you know,

1128
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:45,740
your basic grade school gossip,
Paul.

1129
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:53,030
So we don't like that.
But now there are times,

1130
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,220
unfortunately that's you. You have
to address things and when you do it,

1131
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,420
you do it professionally and you do it.

1132
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:07,780
Your goal is to disarm them because
remember that this negative person inside,

1133
01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:14,060
they
probably want the confrontation.

1134
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:18,560
That's what they want. And so you
know, you say something like, Hey,

1135
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:23,390
I heard you had some critique points
for me about how I'm doing my job.

1136
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:26,990
You know, if if I'd love to get your
feedback so I can tighten up my game.

1137
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:31,550
She just disarm him a little
bit and something like that.

1138
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:36,020
We'll likely diffuse the scenario
a little bit and you know,

1139
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,640
hopefully the people under the,
the,

1140
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:40,820
the person will understand that there
are other people that are telling you

1141
01:09:40,821 --> 01:09:45,440
what's going on. It'll kind of put them
in check and stifle the situation. But

1142
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:52,330
deep preferred methodology
for this situation for me
is quite simple and that is

1143
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,740
ignore an outperform them.

1144
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,073
You see,

1145
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:09,840
while you're over there watching
me and talking about me,

1146
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:14,880
I'm working, I'm working hard, I'm
taking things to the next level.

1147
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:19,410
You Keep Gossiping and out,
keep working.

1148
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,770
You keep talking smack
and I'll keep working.

1149
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:26,130
You keep focusing on everything.

1150
01:10:26,131 --> 01:10:29,670
And everyone else and I'll keep working.

1151
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:36,260
And when you finally look around
at where you are and where I'm at,

1152
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:43,830
you'll realize that you have
nothing left to talk smack about.

1153
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,140
Okay.

1154
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:51,230
Eight you will lose an eye will whip.

1155
01:10:55,250 --> 01:11:00,250
And this key or applies to when people
are playing office politics or forming

1156
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:06,710
their little cliques or
working their personal agendas.

1157
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:12,200
And again, I know sometimes
you have to play those games.

1158
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:14,130
Yeah.
But

1159
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:19,400
let your first course of action lift the
fundamental core of your reaction be to

1160
01:11:25,270 --> 01:11:30,270
outwork and out perform
every last one of them.

1161
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:44,330
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1162
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:49,130
So Echo Charles.
Yes.

1163
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:54,200
Speaking of work,
do work.

1164
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:56,870
Why don't you just go ahead and put
in some work right now and let him,

1165
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,660
everybody know how they can support
this podcast if they want to.

1166
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:03,380
They want to actually,
you know what I'm talking about?

1167
01:12:03,381 --> 01:12:05,580
I'm talking about the work I did today.
Hm.

1168
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:10,310
Make [inaudible] 15 all
that. Anyway, um, anyway,

1169
01:12:10,311 --> 01:12:14,960
we'll talk about on it. You
want to support this podcast,
support yourself on it.

1170
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:20,780
What's the of the Krill oil? It's real.
It's real. And I thought about this,

1171
01:12:20,781 --> 01:12:23,830
like I'm kind of lifting kind
of hard and like I do, um,

1172
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:27,650
like squats right to the very like
different kinds and different weights.

1173
01:12:27,651 --> 01:12:31,840
And do you do overhead squats?
Sometimes you do at overhead squat?

1174
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:36,950
Not a lot. I would call it a
lot, but just one that that is

1175
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:43,520
like one that you can do it all,
like front squats or something like that.

1176
01:12:43,521 --> 01:12:48,290
But I go all the way down all the way
down the caters to squat. Yeah. Well some,

1177
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,071
sometimes you know,

1178
01:12:49,071 --> 01:12:52,220
people don't have the flexibility in
their feet or their ankles or whatever or

1179
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:56,480
you know, you're lifting like 500 pounds
or something going all the way anyway.

1180
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,090
My point is it can be hard on your knees.

1181
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:04,900
It can't straight up those, those
are the facts. It can be anyway.

1182
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:07,720
And I'm kind of going
and cut hard nowadays,

1183
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,600
like pretty much everyday
lift and Jujitsu, you know,

1184
01:13:10,601 --> 01:13:14,140
like harder than I have in the past
for sure. And I don't have the, anyway,

1185
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:17,920
the crude, the point is the Krill oil,
Krill oil is real. Well, I don't have any,

1186
01:13:17,921 --> 01:13:22,900
any pain. No pain, no pain, no pain.

1187
01:13:22,901 --> 01:13:26,650
Still going.
She's still like three a day.

1188
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,980
Three in the morning and three at
night. Just three days. Three a day.

1189
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:34,240
I do twice as much as you.
Well, you're bigger and older.

1190
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:39,010
Do you mean bigger and bigger?
Factually older.

1191
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:44,850
Oh yeah. Yeah, and I was thinking
zero before. Keep that in mind too,

1192
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,160
but yeah, man, it's good.
Krill oil. That's the,

1193
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:50,470
what's funny is when
you think supplements,

1194
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:54,940
that's you think like somebody that's
going to make me stronger, you know,

1195
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:59,770
if I take it versus don't take it. Well,
I guess cruel. It does make you stronger,

1196
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:01,990
but it's like indirect
out more. Yeah. You know,

1197
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:04,540
I've been taking krill oil for so long.

1198
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,910
I don't even know what it's like
to not take krill oil anymore.

1199
01:14:07,690 --> 01:14:10,750
Things just one big
mystery.

1200
01:14:10,751 --> 01:14:15,460
No one big path to victory when you,
when to take the Krill oil on it.

1201
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,270
Ecologically friendly harvesting of Krill.

1202
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:24,960
Watched the video on a.com [inaudible]
dot com slash chocolate if you want 10%

1203
01:14:25,421 --> 01:14:29,140
off a pre workout,
which is total strength and performance,

1204
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:31,810
he'll give you more strength
and more performance.

1205
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:37,330
My anecdotal shroom tech proof,

1206
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:42,250
by the way I, I got on, I had a bunch
of, like I said, I've been working a lot,

1207
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,960
I've been traveling a lot.
When you're traveling,

1208
01:14:43,961 --> 01:14:47,470
you're getting on planes with a bunch
of people that you don't know and they

1209
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:49,870
have all kinds of germs as do I.

1210
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:53,980
And so people get sick and I can't be
sick and do my job because I've got to go

1211
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:57,790
talk to people and meet people and it
gives speeches and all that stuff so I

1212
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:02,020
can't be getting sick.
So I knew I had critical events coming up.

1213
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:05,950
So guess what?
I did shroom tech immune.

1214
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:10,510
Oh I did this room tech immune. Okay.
Powered through. You're not sick now. No,

1215
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:14,020
I'm not sick now. Nope.
Training hard surf today.

1216
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,590
So it'd basically and
worked out and got after it.

1217
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:21,580
So Dang immune to the sickness.
So Dang,

1218
01:15:21,581 --> 01:15:25,900
there's another one in the rotation. Is
that what we're saying and, and yeah,

1219
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:27,770
I cycled it.
Yeah.

1220
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:31,840
I just cycled it because I
knew I didn't want to get sick.

1221
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:35,100
And I suppose you could just say, hey,
have, when do you want to get sick? Right.

1222
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:39,790
We never, yeah. Maybe it's something I
should take more often. Yeah. It's, well,

1223
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:41,580
and it's one of the things kind of like,
um,

1224
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:45,430
like a backend computer
programmer where you don't really,

1225
01:15:45,431 --> 01:15:49,410
you're not hit by the success of it.
You're only hit by the failure of it,

1226
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:54,130
you know, so immune, certain tech
immune, you take it, you don't get sick,

1227
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:58,130
you're like, oh, I ain't, you know,
it's cool, you know? But yeah,

1228
01:15:58,990 --> 01:16:00,100
no, I, like I said,

1229
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:05,020
a bunch of events back to the Ted talk
and so what am I going to show up to the

1230
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:07,870
Ted talk? Coughing. Can't
take that chance. Yeah. Yeah.

1231
01:16:07,871 --> 01:16:11,300
I can't take the chance getting
happen. Stuffy nose. You know what,

1232
01:16:11,301 --> 01:16:13,210
what are you gonna do? No,
you can't do those things.

1233
01:16:13,211 --> 01:16:16,540
You've got to show up and have your a
game. Yeah. You know, shroom tech immune.

1234
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:20,990
Yeah. And these are good
because these aren't like, um,
you know how, okay, so cruel.

1235
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,030
Let's go krill oil where that works.
Your joints. But it's not like,

1236
01:16:25,031 --> 01:16:27,910
it's like a cortisone shot where,
you know,

1237
01:16:27,911 --> 01:16:30,500
you just don't feel it when you get off
it, you're jacked, you know, you're,

1238
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:34,210
you're back to zero. It's like this is
stuff that like helps your body do it,

1239
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:39,130
you know, that's the good part.
It's not, it's not a foreign,

1240
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,140
horrible substance that you're
going to become reliant dependent.

1241
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:48,940
Yeah man. It's still good. Um, and what,
okay. Yeah. They're all good. All of them.

1242
01:16:48,941 --> 01:16:52,000
And there's other stuff.
There's cool stuff to the almond.

1243
01:16:52,001 --> 01:16:56,760
It's like a three nut butter blend
good to him and tried to gourmet.

1244
01:16:56,850 --> 01:17:01,840
It's good, bad. It's too bad. That's
on you bro. Good. And um, yeah,

1245
01:17:01,850 --> 01:17:03,110
there's a lot of stuff on there.

1246
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:06,200
It's protein powder and obviously
quality protein powder if you,

1247
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,700
if you're into protein powder, um,
shroom tech for that. The preworkout,

1248
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:11,900
that's the one, bro. If you're,

1249
01:17:11,901 --> 01:17:15,920
if you're lifting and doing hard workouts,

1250
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,050
get to get the preworkout cause he's
not stimulants, not like, you know, so.

1251
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:21,113
So I don't,

1252
01:17:21,220 --> 01:17:25,640
cause I work out early in the morning as
we know and I don't like working out on

1253
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:27,260
an empty stomach on a full stomach.

1254
01:17:27,261 --> 01:17:30,950
So I work out on an empty stomach
in the morning. Good idea. But I,

1255
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:36,230
and you told me that you might consider
this cheating because I will take it

1256
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,730
pre's usually it's, yeah. Yeah. Yo,

1257
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:44,510
look at you like I'm cheating.
Look at this guy, that button.

1258
01:17:44,511 --> 01:17:49,420
It's not cheating at all. But then he
also on top of that, I don't do it the,

1259
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:54,080
I'll do it. If every heavy
hitter is coming to train, I'll,

1260
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,980
I'll, I'll do it. It's a advantage.
I remember us rolling with,

1261
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:02,180
I was on a 72 hour fast and I was
like almost at the end of it and I did

1262
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:05,060
everything normal. I didn't, it
didn't change anything. I squatted,

1263
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:07,100
I didn't pull ups, said
everything normal workout, surf.

1264
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:10,700
Did you get to I was at the end of it
and I was rolling the big Eric. Um,

1265
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:15,110
you know, judo, Eric and I said, I'm going
to tell you something when we get done.

1266
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:19,760
So we rolled hard and it was no, it was
just putting the way we normally roll,

1267
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:22,190
you know, and got after it
hard. And I said, and he said,

1268
01:18:22,191 --> 01:18:23,500
what were you going to tell
me? I said, yeah, I'm on a,

1269
01:18:23,501 --> 01:18:26,480
I'm on the tail end of a 72 hour
fast right now. And he's like,

1270
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:29,210
well it didn't seem to affect
your performance. And I said, no,

1271
01:18:29,211 --> 01:18:30,920
I don't think it affects
your performance at all.

1272
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,050
Just straight up to somebody.
And it got him a fuck.

1273
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,070
I forget who it was. It
was a while ago, but,

1274
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:42,770
and then I got them and you could tell
he was pissed. Who the hell is that?

1275
01:18:42,771 --> 01:18:45,560
They anyway, he said, oh one of
the first thing that you said.

1276
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:49,750
Oh I'm fasting right now.
Yeah, I forget who it is.

1277
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:53,860
That is actually why I didn't tell Eric.
Right.

1278
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:58,790
Cause then it's just an
excuse. [inaudible] also and
also psychological warfare.

1279
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:02,460
If I tell them, hey, I'm fascinated,
I'm in a fasted state, he might get all,

1280
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:06,650
I get empowered, you know, I'm not going
to let that happen. Uh, Jujitsu is,

1281
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,630
there's a, mine is on my knees to do
two going on. Even before you wrote,

1282
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:15,680
when you clap the hands, give it that
little bump. That was an aggressive pump.

1283
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,510
Remember that time or right after we
rolled and you said, hey, you know,

1284
01:19:20,511 --> 01:19:21,380
did you feel that?

1285
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:24,530
I was like kind of getting tired
towards the end there and I said, no.

1286
01:19:24,531 --> 01:19:29,450
You're like, yeah cause it wasn't. I
feel proud you are of that right now.

1287
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:34,400
That's like your, your best line to
me. Although that was a good one.

1288
01:19:36,230 --> 01:19:38,930
Good one. It was pretty
good. It's, it's, it's hard.

1289
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:44,600
It's hard to get me tired at Jujitsu.
Yeah. You know what it usually,

1290
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:48,840
it's not all conditioning too. I just, I
know how to conserve some energy. Yeah,

1291
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,850
but he probably, you know her. You know
what? This is what, what part of it is,

1292
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,860
if not a major part,

1293
01:19:55,790 --> 01:19:59,510
you can endure fatigue and tiredness
if you're enjoying what you're doing.

1294
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,760
That's why for a lot of people
that treadmill, he's just hell.

1295
01:20:01,790 --> 01:20:03,530
Even though the treadmill
is not that hard,

1296
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:07,100
it's like you're going at like a certain,
like a low percentage of output.

1297
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,360
It's just so boring.
There's no like payoff in Jujitsu.

1298
01:20:10,361 --> 01:20:14,310
It's like its payoff upon payoff upon
payoff. You pass someone's guard.

1299
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,640
Oh my gosh, they pass your guard, your
look what I've got a wage, my thing,

1300
01:20:17,790 --> 01:20:19,830
you know it's like this,
this intricate battle.

1301
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,930
Meanwhile you're getting super tired.
I you get tired. No, no, I had to,

1302
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,160
well me,
I'm in great shape and all that stuff.

1303
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:32,550
You have made some incredible
strides though on two areas.

1304
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:35,400
You used to gas out really,
really bad until,

1305
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:38,010
until you started doing metcons
and your training in your,

1306
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:41,910
in your non Judycki training used to
gas out really bad yet, number one.

1307
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:46,380
Number two you used to get really cost
are phobic and not be able to handle that.

1308
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:50,100
Yeah, and they were, they got to play
on the play off each other. I cured.

1309
01:20:50,101 --> 01:20:51,000
You have both those.

1310
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:57,090
Once I realized you were
claustrophobic for awhile,

1311
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:00,380
you're like test time. How
do you like this? Yeah.

1312
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:04,410
And what's crazy is there's
a third element there is
because if you know you gas

1313
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:08,040
quick
and then you get claustrophobic.

1314
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:11,930
Now that's another enemy,
the gassing and the Claustrophobia,

1315
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:14,470
that's another enemy. So I'm not just
going to you and you're doing it to me.

1316
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:15,690
I'm going to get gas gassing customer.

1317
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,470
So that makes me even more
like anxiety and like you said,

1318
01:21:19,471 --> 01:21:23,010
they're compounding problems
because the more tired you get,

1319
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:25,460
the worst position you get into.
Now you're getting claustrophobic.

1320
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:29,190
Panic can be more tired. Yeah. And then
let that happen one day, the next day.

1321
01:21:29,191 --> 01:21:33,660
What am, what am I scared of now?
It's the swamps of sadness, Bro.

1322
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:36,140
All over again. Well you dug
your way out of that pretty good.

1323
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:38,520
I think the metcon had a lot to
do with it. You know, you just,

1324
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,620
what did you just mentally
eventually say like,

1325
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:44,700
okay when Jocko gets side
control on me and holds me there,

1326
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:47,700
I just need to relax and just sit there
and accept that I'm going to be here for

1327
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:48,511
a little while.
Yeah.

1328
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:53,160
And a big part of it cause
sometimes it start to get dizzy,

1329
01:21:53,161 --> 01:21:57,810
like for real coffee. It's not just the
feeling of, oh I'm just so claustrophobic.

1330
01:21:57,811 --> 01:21:58,660
And that's it.

1331
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,950
I think it was like a for real classic
cause you start to get dizzy and you know,

1332
01:22:02,970 --> 01:22:06,870
like you're not like you're about to faint
but, but something like that, you know,

1333
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:11,600
it was that, it was a good
addition. What am I, you know,

1334
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:15,570
I used to get the guys and train with
them all like in a row and I do like 15

1335
01:22:15,571 --> 01:22:18,090
minutes with this guy and then 15
minutes of this guy and then 15 good go

1336
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:20,070
through the platoons.
And um,

1337
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:25,550
and there's one guy and he was super
claustrophobic and he would get so mad,

1338
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,770
he'd be, you know, I'd hold him, you know,

1339
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:34,620
I'd get across cider and get them out
and just not let him move from my chest

1340
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:39,220
over his face. And he would just, you
know, and he would lose it, you know, and,

1341
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:42,530
and you don't take, he'd be
tapping me like crazy. I'm
like, there's no submission.

1342
01:22:42,810 --> 01:22:44,970
What do you don't do that for me?
You can't tap when there's no submission.

1343
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,580
We got me and then,
you know,

1344
01:22:47,581 --> 01:22:51,560
finally I'd tap them out and then let them
go and he'd be like, he'd be like, God,

1345
01:22:51,620 --> 01:22:55,140
you Kinda just stay off. Meaning get so
mad and just to kind of stop training.

1346
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:01,250
I mean if you have like a dean did
that to me w back, back in the,

1347
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:05,040
when I had, he was like mounted,
then I'd be like, and then I tap.

1348
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:11,470
Oh Man. That's like man dean.
Actually it was funny yesterday.

1349
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,270
Maybe the day. Yeah, it was yesterday.

1350
01:23:14,410 --> 01:23:18,100
The did you do the power was going out
like momentarily in the gym a few times.

1351
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:21,880
Yeah. Well before the power started,
like it was going off for 10 seconds.

1352
01:23:21,881 --> 01:23:25,620
Certain lights though. Yeah, but
so it was killing the clock. Yes.

1353
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,370
So we were going when the clock was still
running and he was doing that to me.

1354
01:23:30,371 --> 01:23:30,581
Right.

1355
01:23:30,581 --> 01:23:34,660
And when he tries to make
me claustrophobic or tries
to get reaction out of me,

1356
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:38,540
I just go into like complete
detachment, mental shutdown. Not,

1357
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:41,350
not mental shutdown in a negative
way, but mental shutdown. Like, okay,

1358
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:44,450
I'm not going to show you any.
And so he's like,

1359
01:23:44,830 --> 01:23:48,760
like basically putting his
knuckle into my rib, he's mounted,

1360
01:23:48,761 --> 01:23:52,390
smothering me and rubbing his knuckle
into my ribs and I'm just laying there

1361
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:55,160
like taking it and just thinking
about other things. And,

1362
01:23:55,161 --> 01:23:58,500
and actually I'm thinking
like when I get on top and,

1363
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:03,950
and then the timer ran out and he kept
doing it and he kept doing it any to kept

1364
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:07,750
doing it for like another 30 seconds.

1365
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,540
And then he laughed and he jumped off.

1366
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:15,090
So then we were going again and I,

1367
01:24:15,370 --> 01:24:19,510
I got him into got a good position,
right?

1368
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:22,830
I got him in the arm lock and I'm
sitting there and he's already finished,

1369
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,630
you know, if you don't believe
me, go watch him. Go again.

1370
01:24:25,631 --> 01:24:28,540
John Jay and Metamorris
and there's John Jay,

1371
01:24:28,541 --> 01:24:32,140
one of the best Jujitsu practitioners of
all time goes for a normal walk on Dean

1372
01:24:32,140 --> 01:24:32,973
Dean gets out of it.

1373
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:38,500
So I'll go in for an arm lock on Dean
and the timer goes like at the end of the

1374
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:40,430
round and

1375
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:46,690
in and he's like, Oh God, here. He
goes, oh, because I didn't let go.

1376
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:49,120
And he goes, he goes, I said,

1377
01:24:49,121 --> 01:24:51,790
you violated the Jujitsu Geneva
Conventions on the last round.

1378
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:56,440
And he laughed and then I let them go.
But uh, you, no, it's all good then.

1379
01:24:56,441 --> 01:25:00,460
It's kind of what that is. Well
look, I tapping you don't let go.

1380
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:05,140
That's a violation of the Geneva
Convention. Convention's yeah, it's true.

1381
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:07,570
But you can't,
you can't be breaking those laws.

1382
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:10,900
The metcon and getting into condition,

1383
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:15,580
losing like little bit of weight or
whatever. Sure. It gets, in my case,

1384
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:18,880
it got me in better shape
and you can go longer,

1385
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:20,260
less classic flavor just in general.

1386
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:25,530
But the bigger impact was that that's
not something I have to worry about

1387
01:25:25,961 --> 01:25:26,440
anymore.

1388
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:31,440
Dealing with Ba when I get
tired and mentally you become,

1389
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:32,081
you know what?

1390
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:34,810
It feels like to be tired because I
don't think you knew what that felt like

1391
01:25:34,811 --> 01:25:38,440
before. It was hard to deal with. I would
say that's how it felt to me. Like what?

1392
01:25:38,441 --> 01:25:41,680
I'm like, Dang, I'm tired. I need to
not be tired. That's the goal now.

1393
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:44,630
I don't care about getting tapped
out anymore. It's the tiredness is,

1394
01:25:44,650 --> 01:25:49,090
is really the fight that demon here,
not the topping up,

1395
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:52,030
but once you go the Mecca nut,
like I said,

1396
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:54,970
the metcon and just muscular
conditioning in general,

1397
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,340
it'll sure it'll get you in shape.

1398
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:59,860
But since you have to kind of do
it all the time for it to work,

1399
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:03,740
like any exercise you're used to
it, that feeling, he comes comment,

1400
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,910
what do you just knocked your lady
when you're mentally inoculated to, oh,

1401
01:26:07,911 --> 01:26:11,960
I'm out of breath. I'm not you.
What you used to think was,

1402
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:13,820
I'm out of breath and I'm going to die.

1403
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:19,120
How you think I'm out of breath
and that's okay. I'll recover. Yes.

1404
01:26:19,230 --> 01:26:23,210
Want to cover in some other position
and man, it makes Jujitsu way, funner,

1405
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:27,100
way funner.
You can disclose nd two 10 minute rant,

1406
01:26:27,101 --> 01:26:30,350
you know with the thing and he's, and
he's going to hard and it was like, sure,

1407
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,790
you're bull. You know it's a
good, good workout but it's, yeah,

1408
01:26:33,791 --> 01:26:36,980
it's just makes it way funner for
sure. But yeah, the point is there.

1409
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:39,800
That's why you can endure tiredness
is when you're having a good time.

1410
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:41,270
When those little payoff,
do you ever notice,

1411
01:26:41,271 --> 01:26:43,910
even if you don't really roll that how
you might be different? Actually no,

1412
01:26:43,911 --> 01:26:47,810
I'm sure you feel this when you go home
you feel like the heat radiating from

1413
01:26:47,811 --> 01:26:49,470
your body still.
You know,

1414
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,480
even after you go home and like Dan
didn't really roll that hard cause it

1415
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:57,170
doesn't feel like it's that hard
cause it was so fun, you know? Yeah.

1416
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:01,410
Well I I real hard every single time.
It's

1417
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:07,460
the genius behind it anyway.
If you want help the performance,

1418
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:12,470
was that just a 14 or a 20 minute talk
about [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko.

1419
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:14,950
Sure. Cool. Yeah,

1420
01:27:15,070 --> 01:27:18,290
a little bit of some digression but
these are all helpful things though.

1421
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:20,510
They are very helpful on it.

1422
01:27:20,511 --> 01:27:23,360
That's just going to improve your
performance straight up. Indeed.

1423
01:27:23,390 --> 01:27:27,560
If you want to improve performance,
which we do, there's another one,

1424
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:30,110
I'm going to go into it.
We got some time.

1425
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,950
So I'm filling up water,
you know,

1426
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,250
you know the big gallons of water or
five gallons. So go ahead, fill up.

1427
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:40,990
I got four of them. So I put them in the
back of my car. In the back seat. Yeah.

1428
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:45,950
So when I bring them from the water
filler thing to my car and grabbing them

1429
01:27:45,951 --> 01:27:49,550
both and I'm walking across the street.
You had to or you had four?

1430
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:53,650
I had four but two at a time. I feel
too, cause it's two things, whatever.

1431
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:56,510
So they're full. I'm walking across the
street to, you know, not the street,

1432
01:27:56,511 --> 01:28:00,170
the parking lot to my car to put them
in. And I'm like, this isn't even hard.

1433
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:02,420
But they look kind of big,
you know. And I'm like,

1434
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:05,090
this isn't even hard cause
it's like I'm not like stiff.

1435
01:28:05,091 --> 01:28:09,360
It's not like I'm warmed up
ready, don't get after it.
You know, I'm like, okay, but,

1436
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:14,150
and you're walking there at handles so
it shouldn't be that hard for someone my

1437
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,110
weight and whatever. So I get to the car
and I put them in, but I'm like, Hey,

1438
01:28:18,111 --> 01:28:23,030
I need more room to put the other two so
I don't just trying to lug them in all

1439
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:26,090
perfect for,
I got to like stretch and put these,

1440
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,300
you know they're five pound jugs.
What I see,

1441
01:28:28,301 --> 01:28:30,890
you got to stress these awkward position,
but I did it kind of no problem.

1442
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,050
If I were in, I've been at times
where I'm not in that good a shape,

1443
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,630
my joints are off bro. I would
to do, I would hurt myself.

1444
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:41,030
That's how you hurt your back because
that is what I'm saying how people are,

1445
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:44,780
they're back doing the dumb stuff because
they're not, they're not in good shape.

1446
01:28:44,870 --> 01:28:48,380
Yeah, and that's a lot of times that's
really what it is is because your just,

1447
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:51,140
your body's not used to like
moving all of a sudden like that.

1448
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:54,530
But if it is and you've
got the Krill oil going,

1449
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:58,790
that's the kind of things you can do.
Almost like a superpower anyway.

1450
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,760
If you want these amazing supplements.
No,

1451
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:06,800
they're the best ones cause we all
know that on it.com/jocko 10% off.

1452
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:11,160
Support Yourself.
Support everyone anyway.

1453
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:14,340
And if you shop at Amazon is a
good way to support and you know,

1454
01:29:14,341 --> 01:29:17,200
you shop at Amazon. Oh
he knew, oh yeah, big

1455
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,920
getting books, getting whatever.
Click through the website. Again,

1456
01:29:22,921 --> 01:29:26,310
this is just support. So go to Jocko,
podcast.com a little banner, Amazon,

1457
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,480
Amazon banner over there on
the side. Um, click on that.

1458
01:29:30,481 --> 01:29:32,240
Then do your shopping can support that.

1459
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,860
You don't think that's a big deal
and you're like, ah, you know what?

1460
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:35,910
That's probably not that big of a deal.

1461
01:29:35,911 --> 01:29:38,850
I'm just going to go right to Amazon
without clicking through that.

1462
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:42,840
That is cool to me that that's cool.
But if you do want to support,

1463
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,780
but you still think that
that's not that big of a deal.

1464
01:29:45,781 --> 01:29:48,390
Maybe I'll support another way or
something like that, that that's cool,

1465
01:29:48,391 --> 01:29:52,050
but it's not true. That is a big
deal. Yeah, it's a small action.

1466
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,170
So it may not seem like a bit of,

1467
01:29:53,171 --> 01:29:54,930
it's like I'll just click
through and that's kind of it.

1468
01:29:55,450 --> 01:29:58,000
But it's a big deal and it
doesn't cost you anything.

1469
01:29:58,001 --> 01:29:59,950
It doesn't cost you anything to second.

1470
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:03,510
Ron's got some money that they want to
give to us. As long as you click through.

1471
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,190
Yeah. They're like, they're basically,

1472
01:30:05,191 --> 01:30:09,150
the attitude is from Amazon is
that's a win win. They're like,

1473
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:14,270
hey these shoppers are coming to buy
stuff from us through Jocko podcasts.

1474
01:30:16,020 --> 01:30:19,710
All right, cool. Cool. That's
take care of guys. Exactly right.

1475
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:23,190
So it's like a circle triangle, three
people, three parties, triangle,

1476
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:27,240
let's support. Yeah. Then
you get, you know your stuff.

1477
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,680
If you've got Amazon prime two days
later, one day, sometimes same day anyway,

1478
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:32,821
Amazon Click through.

1479
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:37,440
That's a good way to support and then
you can subscribe to the podcast if you

1480
01:30:37,441 --> 01:30:39,150
haven't already. Itunes, stitcher,

1481
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:44,810
Google play and various others outlet
and somebody posted that you can,

1482
01:30:45,901 --> 01:30:49,710
if you have Alexa, do you know
what Alexa is? It's Amazon Echo.

1483
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:51,300
It's Amazon name is Alexa.

1484
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:56,130
And if you have that I do you do,
you know that you can say

1485
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:01,560
Alexa play Jocko podcast and
then it says back to you,

1486
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:05,670
you want to hear the show
Jocko cause they don't,

1487
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:09,180
they think that podcasts isn't part
of the name because it's artificial

1488
01:31:09,181 --> 01:31:10,160
intelligence.
Gotcha.

1489
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:14,190
So just you want to hear the show Jocko
when you say yes and then it says I'm

1490
01:31:14,191 --> 01:31:18,240
finding the latest episode and then it
plays. John podcast is kind of like, uh,

1491
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,580
like uh, it'd be silly.
You want to watch uh,

1492
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:26,550
Restrepo movie the song this,

1493
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:30,450
but then the song is called love song
or something like this. Yeah. You know,

1494
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:33,510
the song would probably be called destroy
planet earth. Right. In your case,

1495
01:31:33,511 --> 01:31:36,540
for sure. For sure. That's
something that, yeah, that thing,

1496
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:40,050
that thing is kind of cool to start to
ask it. Do you have one? Okay. So ask him,

1497
01:31:40,140 --> 01:31:42,350
ask it. Well, what's one plus one there?

1498
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,300
She's going to say the sum
of one plus one is two,

1499
01:31:45,330 --> 01:31:48,800
but I think you already knew
that. So they will, you know,

1500
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,200
he knows the little things anyway.
Yeah, that's a good one. Anyway,

1501
01:31:52,201 --> 01:31:56,220
I subscribe to the podcast on
iTunes and all the various outlets.

1502
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:00,880
If you're not in Thai tunes specifically
and on Youtube we do have a youtube

1503
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:05,500
channel, put some videos on there,
constantly working on these videos.

1504
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:09,820
Situation. Some take longer, you know,
more and more work and whatever time,

1505
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:14,020
um, than others. But they're
out there. They're doing it.

1506
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:18,430
Jocko mcnuggets small
little clips of the words,

1507
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:23,500
the advice and philosophy.
Jocko also dad,

1508
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:27,270
ted talk that I did,
she is on Youtube right now on the toe.

1509
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:30,690
Gold Ted Jocko Willink. Ted Talk
or something like that. Yeah,

1510
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:34,270
you'll get to see it. It's good.
I talked about uh, you know,

1511
01:32:34,450 --> 01:32:38,260
war and stuff like that.
A little concept called extreme ownership.

1512
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,540
Nailed it.
It's actually good like that.

1513
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:45,880
That's the one where you know how you got,

1514
01:32:45,881 --> 01:32:49,840
you got to condense it down obviously,
you know, like distill it down.

1515
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,380
That was a good distillation.
Those good points.

1516
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:59,440
12 minutes, not long. There you go. Yup.
Youtube. But yeah, I subscribe to the,

1517
01:32:59,441 --> 01:33:02,230
to the, you know, the youtube channel.
We've got one of those. I'm also,

1518
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:07,231
Jack was a store called Jocko store Url
Jocko store.com if you're into shirts,

1519
01:33:07,991 --> 01:33:10,060
discipline equals freedom
and Twitter was like,

1520
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:14,790
I like the Oji discipline equals freedom.
There's only one version of the desert,

1521
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,490
but the thing is Julie,
Oh gee, the original,

1522
01:33:18,610 --> 01:33:23,530
the original discipline equals freedom.
Super simple to the point, if you will,

1523
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:28,420
a good quality. I made sure that
they were good quality shirts.

1524
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:32,000
I'm not the kind, you just give away at
the Ballpark, you know that kind of, yeah.

1525
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:34,930
You used to talk about those shirts
that you give away at the ballpark.

1526
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:37,000
You haven't mentioned that in awhile.
Yeah,

1527
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:43,540
because that one's cool because Ooh,
free stuff,

1528
01:33:43,541 --> 01:33:46,540
but when you get home you don't wear
it. No, because this one sucks. Yeah,

1529
01:33:46,541 --> 01:33:49,120
it's not good. It's not wearable.
You know that one where you're like,

1530
01:33:49,121 --> 01:33:51,790
your friend gives you the free shirt
and they're like what I did for you and

1531
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:54,820
then you're like [inaudible] wearing. It's
like it doesn't fit good and whatever.

1532
01:33:54,821 --> 01:33:58,200
These ones like fit good. They're
solid. In fact, this guy, Ryan,

1533
01:33:58,210 --> 01:34:02,560
I know he said it's my favorite shirt
to wear because it makes me look good.

1534
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:05,290
Like it fits, you know, it's fucking dope.

1535
01:34:06,370 --> 01:34:10,080
I don't observe stuff like
anyway,

1536
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:13,390
I may never make a made them.
I'm here to win.

1537
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:20,200
Oh yeah. You don't care what you look
like, but yeah, they're good. Solid.

1538
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:23,730
Look at them. I'm not saying by shirt.
Just go to the chocolate store.com.

1539
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:27,270
Go there,
look at the shirts you like to shirt.

1540
01:34:27,271 --> 01:34:30,970
Do you want to represent you want to
support, get a shirt, get a rash guard.

1541
01:34:31,660 --> 01:34:33,550
Got some good reviews on the rash guard.

1542
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:39,810
Multiple instances of
increasing performance and
results with the rash guard.

1543
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:46,240
Proven and against Jockos philosophy.
Damon, they look good. You know,

1544
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,420
if you care, you know that you
want to look good. Hey man,

1545
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:51,660
there's that element
as well. Layers. Yeah.

1546
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:54,430
I'm more concerned about the
performance in the looks. Yeah, man.

1547
01:34:54,431 --> 01:34:58,300
So I'll take that 19% minimum bonus.
Yeah.

1548
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:01,970
You look good to go.
I guess actually that kind of thing.

1549
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:07,630
Sure. Patches. The velcro lenses.

1550
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:11,200
A regular kind too. Um, but
the velcro one with the,

1551
01:35:11,400 --> 01:35:16,040
the what do you call the
color right there. Regulation.
Yeah. The one you can wear.

1552
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,790
I saw, um, shoot, I forget
his name on Twitter.

1553
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:22,740
He showed me his patch like
collection to the Velcro, you know,

1554
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:27,020
discipline equals freedom was all up in
there. It was good. Looked real good.

1555
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:31,610
And this one is a big
one to support yourself.

1556
01:35:31,970 --> 01:35:35,090
Psychological warfare
is literal like support,

1557
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:37,040
like a spot.

1558
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:42,580
The feedback from everyone out
there on psychological warfare,

1559
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:46,360
it's 100% of fat.

1560
01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:53,170
We'll do listen to the
track sugarcoated lies.

1561
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:55,010
If you listen that track,

1562
01:35:55,040 --> 01:36:00,040
you could be in Krispy Kreme donuts after
not eating for three days and you will

1563
01:36:00,741 --> 01:36:03,440
go in there. You listened to that
track, you will not eat a donut.

1564
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:07,250
You will not know. It's
true. It's absolutely true.

1565
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:11,390
And the wake up thing to wake up
and I was going to say the wake up,

1566
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,380
you will get out of bed. Yeah, because,
because you, this is the thing,

1567
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:20,850
you know what's being told to you
is true. No, it's true. Yeah. Man.

1568
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:24,350
You, you, part of your brain is
Tang. You know what? It's not true.

1569
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:28,330
We just get up right now and
one donuts not gonna kill.

1570
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,240
Actually it is going to kill you so
you're not going to eat it. Yeah.

1571
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:35,900
Psychological warfare. That's
a good one. By the way.

1572
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:41,940
I listened to it or listening
to yourself sometime. He will.

1573
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,840
You know what I was kind of like,
why do I actually listen to this now?

1574
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:46,030
Now I listened to it. Well, it,

1575
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:49,850
it could actually in a way be more
effective for you because it's really you

1576
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:51,780
talking to yourself, Shirley. Me. Yeah.

1577
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,980
It's like you talking to
yourself like your brain.

1578
01:36:54,981 --> 01:36:57,950
It's like the voice in your head.
It's true and this is a good one.

1579
01:36:57,951 --> 01:37:01,040
Just like the Krill oil and
just like the on it stuff.

1580
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,260
It's not like like get up and get
after it. Like it's not like, wait,

1581
01:37:06,261 --> 01:37:09,080
let me explain what it is.
It's these tracks on an album.

1582
01:37:09,081 --> 01:37:12,740
You can buy it from
iTunes and it's on Amazon.

1583
01:37:12,741 --> 01:37:16,180
Other resources to find it.
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's every,

1584
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:20,060
you can just purchase these MP three
tracks and you can play in your phone

1585
01:37:20,061 --> 01:37:23,000
before you're about to be,
when you're having moments of weakness,

1586
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,800
you're going to skip the workout
cause you don't feel like it.

1587
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:25,670
Are you going to skip,

1588
01:37:25,671 --> 01:37:28,640
you're going to mess up your diet
because you're doing old and it looks so

1589
01:37:28,641 --> 01:37:32,750
delicious or you want to
press snooze on the thing.

1590
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:33,890
You can put it as your alarm or whatever.

1591
01:37:33,891 --> 01:37:38,390
You buy these tracks and there for
different situations and it'll give you a

1592
01:37:38,391 --> 01:37:39,080
little spot.

1593
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:42,200
We'll say that chocolate will be there
to give you a little spot anyway.

1594
01:37:42,201 --> 01:37:46,570
Their mental, a mental spot. Yeah.
Psychological, psychological there.

1595
01:37:46,580 --> 01:37:50,070
They don't fight the urge
to be a slacker crush,

1596
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:53,450
but it's good because it's not
like the get up and get out.

1597
01:37:53,451 --> 01:37:56,160
It's scares you out of bed so you'll
get out of bed. It's not that,

1598
01:37:56,490 --> 01:38:00,480
it's like psychological warfare. It tells
your mind to do things the certain way,

1599
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:03,990
you know? So it's really, you're doing it
and it's like, it's not a kinetic strike.

1600
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:07,680
It's psychological warfare, which
is actually more effective. Yeah.

1601
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:12,620
Cause you're doing that. It's like
the cortisone shot versus the cruel.

1602
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:18,150
We prefer to let our body do the work.
Yes,

1603
01:38:18,330 --> 01:38:21,960
exactly right.
And we prefer to let our mind do the work.

1604
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:24,810
If you're getting out of bed cause
someone's yelling out of you. Okay,

1605
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:25,680
well that's okay.

1606
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:29,340
But it's better if it's you that gets
yourself out of bed because you use

1607
01:38:29,341 --> 01:38:32,550
psychological warfare on
yourself. Yup. Cause you did,

1608
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:36,840
you did good things with the information
that you were presented with is good.

1609
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,350
And I'll add, I'll give it to you.
Oh, I'm going to pat you on the back.

1610
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:44,700
Pat On the back number. It was
psychological warfare was number one.

1611
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:50,160
Is it stolen my nine on iTunes
since day one. Oh well hey, don't,

1612
01:38:50,161 --> 01:38:51,210
don't pat me on the back.

1613
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:54,600
Thank you everyone that's gone in and
bought psychological or for, thank you.

1614
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,350
Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah, fully.
But you gotta admit, it's like,

1615
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:02,970
you know you did that thing, you know.
No, actually you got to admit that.

1616
01:39:02,971 --> 01:39:05,250
If no one wanted to hear it
and wanting to get after it,

1617
01:39:05,251 --> 01:39:09,540
then I would be Dan and myself.
We're like a little group of like,

1618
01:39:09,660 --> 01:39:11,970
this is a good, good thing
we're doing here. You know,

1619
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,630
get everybody out of bed and stop
eating donuts. Thinking of good things.

1620
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:20,370
If you want some Jocko white tea,
sure it's in stock.

1621
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:25,980
It's on Amazon. If you're an
America, get it on Amazon.

1622
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:29,460
If you're in a foreign country,
go to Ebay, parole resourcing.

1623
01:39:29,461 --> 01:39:33,030
It's the official listing. You can get
it there, do you? You already know what,

1624
01:39:33,570 --> 01:39:35,160
what the tea is going to do for you.

1625
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:40,680
You already know that you are weak,
you will become strong.

1626
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:46,260
You are stupid. You're going
to become smart. You are lazy.

1627
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:48,780
You're going to become aggressive.
Just going to solve all your problems.

1628
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:52,890
Do you know what? That's the side
effects because it also just tastes good.

1629
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,740
So which ones are going to go
and I'll tell you what. Right now

1630
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:04,730
we are assessing and likely going
to put Jocko white tea in cans.

1631
01:40:10,890 --> 01:40:15,780
Old, right? Like the drink an
energy drink doesn't help you.

1632
01:40:15,781 --> 01:40:18,630
Right? Right. It's tea. It's
wack. Yeah. This is boom.

1633
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:23,280
Oh you're in seven 11 good
stuff like sugar, Caffeine,

1634
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:27,240
candy, negativity, stimulator.
Boom. Here you go. Hmm.

1635
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:31,310
Is there caffeine and Jocko white tea?
Yes, there is a little bit, a little bit,

1636
01:40:31,470 --> 01:40:34,410
but it's good for you actually a little
bit and Mike. Exactly. Thank you.

1637
01:40:34,411 --> 01:40:39,210
Echo micro dose. Not going to get
you all jittery. So Jocko white tea,

1638
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:44,250
you can get it on Amazon when you're
on Amazon you can pick up the book.

1639
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:49,251
Extreme ownership by me and my brother
Leif Babin and what's cool is our company

1640
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:54,250
echelon front.

1641
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,630
We work with a bunch of
different kinds of companies,

1642
01:40:55,631 --> 01:40:59,410
leadership and management consulting and
it's always cool to see and hear about

1643
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:02,680
how the book spreads through those
companies. Somebody, you know,

1644
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:04,060
somebody heard about it,

1645
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:07,300
somebody heard me on Tim Ferriss or so
some of you heard me on Joe Rogan or

1646
01:41:07,301 --> 01:41:11,860
somebody you've heard me on this podcast
and it gets in there and a guy it

1647
01:41:11,861 --> 01:41:14,200
spreads.
It just spread.

1648
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:18,010
You know a guy buys it for his team
and then he buys it for, you know,

1649
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,700
the CEO gives them a gift and
the CEO buys it for everyone.

1650
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:22,300
So it's really cool to see that.

1651
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:27,990
And it's cool to see how it
helps companies align their
culture and align their

1652
01:41:31,301 --> 01:41:35,080
leadership teams. So go out,

1653
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:39,370
get it for the people you work with,
give them the tools

1654
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,520
to lead. And you know,

1655
01:41:45,521 --> 01:41:50,290
the deal is you make a little investment
getting the book. It's 20 bucks,

1656
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,320
right? You give that book
to your key team members,

1657
01:41:54,250 --> 01:41:57,460
it's gonna make your life easier.
Return on investment, good to go.

1658
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:02,200
And while you're doing that, you can
get this book, another book right here.

1659
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:06,220
It's um,
it's called way of the warrior kid.

1660
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:11,080
And this is the deal. This is what we
have to watch out for. Order it now.

1661
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:14,230
Why order it now for not going to get it
until May 2nd. That's when it comes out.

1662
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:17,820
Here's why. If we don't order
it now, it's going to happen.

1663
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:19,120
The same thing that happened
with Jocko white tea,

1664
01:42:20,110 --> 01:42:22,360
the people that are printing is
going like, oh no one's ordering it.

1665
01:42:22,420 --> 01:42:27,400
So we're not going to, you know, we'll
print 12 copies the day it comes out.

1666
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,890
We're going to get a lot of orders and
everyone's going to have to sit around

1667
01:42:29,891 --> 01:42:31,090
and wait for the thing to be printed.

1668
01:42:31,091 --> 01:42:34,870
So what we want to do is give them the
indication that yes, book is coming out.

1669
01:42:34,871 --> 01:42:37,120
We don't want to end up
with Jocko white tea style,

1670
01:42:37,210 --> 01:42:42,210
Barron Armageddon on our hands to
with the book and I'll tell you it is,

1671
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:48,940
you know, it's a book. It's a
key. It's a kid's book admittedly,

1672
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:53,230
but I'm going to tell you uncle Jake,
who's in the book,

1673
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,990
who teaches his nephew
how to get after it.

1674
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:01,170
Uncle Jake's got some lessons for
a very buddy about discipline,

1675
01:43:02,230 --> 01:43:05,200
about working out,
about overcoming fear,

1676
01:43:05,201 --> 01:43:09,790
about diet and exercise and life.

1677
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:17,290
It's a book about life and know should I,
should I read?

1678
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:18,221
How did you get the,

1679
01:43:18,221 --> 01:43:22,270
I know he's got a physical copy or a
physical copy that I'm holding in my hands

1680
01:43:22,271 --> 01:43:25,600
right now is called the
Galley and they give you,

1681
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:29,330
it's so that you can see and make sure
and you can go through it and correct it

1682
01:43:29,430 --> 01:43:33,670
like a final answer, like a final
edit. And this one's pretty good.

1683
01:43:34,490 --> 01:43:39,040
Close. Give us a taste. So here we go.

1684
01:43:39,041 --> 01:43:43,990
So at this point, here's what's
going on. Um, at this point,

1685
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:47,620
basically the kid mark,

1686
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,770
he's like I said, he does know how
to do, he can't do any pull ups,

1687
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:55,430
doesn't know his times tables.
He's getting picked on at school,

1688
01:43:55,431 --> 01:44:00,200
doesn't know how to swim. Guess
what? He's a 10 year old kid in life.

1689
01:44:00,230 --> 01:44:03,140
Life is hard. He's realizing that
he's bummed out. He's been sad.

1690
01:44:03,141 --> 01:44:07,760
His uncle Jake comes to live with him for
the summer. His uncle, his uncle Jake,

1691
01:44:07,761 --> 01:44:10,820
he used to be in the seal teams.
He's getting out so he can go to college.

1692
01:44:10,821 --> 01:44:12,890
But during the summer he's
living with his sister.

1693
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:18,730
So now when Uncle Jake realizes
that mark as all these issues,

1694
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:24,020
like I said, what does he say when mark
freaks out and cries and says, I go,

1695
01:44:24,021 --> 01:44:27,920
cause it's Jews. Uncle Jake says,
good, we can solve these problems.

1696
01:44:28,430 --> 01:44:29,550
And then he says, look, you

1697
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:31,320
okay,

1698
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,280
you're not really getting after it.
Do you?

1699
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,760
Do you need to be? Instead of being
this kind of wimpy kid over here,

1700
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:39,900
you need to be a warrior kid.

1701
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:45,480
And mark sort of what's a warrior kid?
And so at this point

1702
01:44:47,020 --> 01:44:51,000
they're, they're talking about like,
do you actually know what a warrior is?

1703
01:44:51,450 --> 01:44:53,400
And I'll go back to the book right now.

1704
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:57,390
So here's uncle Jake.

1705
01:44:57,420 --> 01:45:00,120
Do you even know what a warrior is?

1706
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,480
Mark says yes.
I mean,

1707
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:08,160
I guess I know a warrior is
someone who fights and wars, right?

1708
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:12,690
And Uncle Jake says that is one part.
But what else?

1709
01:45:14,070 --> 01:45:16,110
I'm not sure what else.

1710
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,940
So do you think that the only way
to be a warrior is to fight in wars?

1711
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:24,720
And do you think that any one
who fights and wars is a warrior?

1712
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:27,510
I guess so.

1713
01:45:28,460 --> 01:45:29,170
Okay.

1714
01:45:29,170 --> 01:45:30,130
Well,
you guessed wrong.

1715
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:36,180
There was a lot more to being a warrior
that just being in a war warriors or

1716
01:45:36,551 --> 01:45:40,300
people that stand up for themselves,
they face challenges.

1717
01:45:40,420 --> 01:45:43,210
Warriors work hard to achieve goals.

1718
01:45:43,450 --> 01:45:46,300
They have the discipline to
overcome their weaknesses.

1719
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:51,130
Warriors are people that constantly
try to test and improve themselves.

1720
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:54,160
And yes,
war is the ultimate test.

1721
01:45:54,730 --> 01:45:59,570
But not all warriors go to war
and then Marxists.

1722
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:02,390
But how can a kid be a warrior?

1723
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,220
Okay.

1724
01:46:04,220 --> 01:46:06,650
And uncle mark says,
or uncle Jake says,

1725
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:12,500
by doing everything I just said,
a normal kid doesn't push himself.

1726
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:18,080
A warrior kid does. A normal kid doesn't
work to constantly improve himself.

1727
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:23,420
A warrior kid does. I look at all these
problems you cried to me about yesterday.

1728
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:28,300
A warrior kid wouldn't cry
about those problems or war.

1729
01:46:28,301 --> 01:46:32,870
Your kid would do something about
those problems and then mark says,

1730
01:46:32,871 --> 01:46:37,160
do what? Do what? Do whatever it takes.

1731
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:40,400
Every problem you have can be overcome.

1732
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:45,580
Every one of them you can't do pullups
you work out and get stronger and to you

1733
01:46:46,101 --> 01:46:48,950
can you don't know your
times tables you study.

1734
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:53,100
Train your mind until you know them cold.
You can't swim.

1735
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:58,590
You learn how you get picked on.
You learn how to fight.

1736
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:04,560
Fight. I asked, yes. Fight. Just
like anything else in the world,

1737
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:06,030
there are techniques to fighting,

1738
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:10,830
like learning a sport and when you
know the techniques and practice them,

1739
01:47:10,860 --> 01:47:15,780
you can defend yourself from anyone.
You really think I could learn all that.

1740
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:19,530
I know you can.
Like I told you last night,

1741
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,480
I had to transform myself when I got
in the navy. I had to get stronger,

1742
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:27,450
I had to learn to fight.
I even had to learn to learn,

1743
01:47:28,890 --> 01:47:32,520
but I did it and if I did it,
so can you,

1744
01:47:34,050 --> 01:47:34,883
do you want to,

1745
01:47:35,670 --> 01:47:40,670
do you want to overcome all these
challenges you face of course

1746
01:47:45,460 --> 01:47:46,020
and

1747
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:49,710
then as a wrap up that conversation they
were out in the park when they're doing

1748
01:47:49,711 --> 01:47:54,360
that and mark says we walked through
the park and back to the house without

1749
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:58,440
saying another word.
Something had already changed.

1750
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:04,210
Sounds like we're about to get after it.
So yeah,

1751
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:06,610
a fun book

1752
01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:13,300
might want to get after it and also on
top of that the book is coming out May

1753
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:19,330
2nd that's cool. May 4th and fifth guess
what's going on. The muster right there.

1754
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:23,740
Marriott Marquis in New York City.
Basically two months away from right now.

1755
01:48:24,070 --> 01:48:28,060
So sign up, book your
ticket, get your hotel room.

1756
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:30,970
It's going to be awesome. Life's going
to be there. I'm going to be there.

1757
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:33,250
Obviously leaves going to be there.
Jp is going to be there.

1758
01:48:33,310 --> 01:48:37,750
Echo is going to be there. Dave
