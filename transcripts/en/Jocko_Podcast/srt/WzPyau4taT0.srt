1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
This is Jocko podcast number
one 20 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,780
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:12,310
So it's been a while
since Q. And. A. Yeah.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,580
So we have some Q and a
from the interwebs. Yeah,

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,810
go first question Jocko.

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,800
More than once on the podcast,

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:29,510
you've mentioned how the teams were so
competitive that no one wanted to admit

8
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,344
when they were cold.

9
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,880
Being too too cold puts you at a
tactical disadvantage in hindsight,

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,530
was that a failure to control your
ego so your ego doesn't control you?

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,650
I didn't ask this question.
Out of idle curiosity.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,300
A lot of folks that an active duty,

13
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:47,270
listen to the podcast and I'm concerned
they might put themselves their

14
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:51,080
teammates and their mission in jeopardy
because of their egos won't let them

15
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,560
admit they're too hot or
too cold. All right, so

16
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,710
good question.
Good point.

17
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,390
And there's definitely a big difference
between between being uncomfortably

18
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:03,040
cold,
right?

19
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:08,041
Like on like you're just uncomfortably
cold or uncomfortably hot or we thirsty

20
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,430
or hungry or whatever.

21
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,140
And being in an actual state where
you're putting the mission in jeopardy

22
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,800
because you're too cold or
hot or thirsty or whatever.

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,390
So I just needed to say this.

24
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,930
In the teams you are 95%
of the time you are cold,

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,460
too cold, too hot, too wet, too
thirsty, too miserable, something.

26
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,770
There's no time.
When you're in the field,

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,770
you put on a hundred pounds
worth of gear worth of gear.

28
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,800
You're uncomfortable from the word
go from the word go and you're cold.

29
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,810
You know, you come in over the
beach, you're in wet cammies.

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,380
It doesn't matter who will come out with
great technology and we've got a dry

31
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:54,700
suit or this, we got a wet suit that
no, you're, you're miserable. It's not.

32
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,200
You're going to be cold.
You're gonna be uncomfortable.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,100
You ride in a Zodiac
first, you, you ride in a,

34
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,920
in a big ribbon,

35
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,610
which is like a 10 meter boat and
you have your Zodiacs on that boat,

36
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,250
so you're in that boat,
you're getting sprayed with water,

37
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,900
you're getting bounced up and down.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,370
You do that for three hours and then you
launch your little boats into the water.

39
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:18,010
Well there, while you're doing that,
you fall in the water, you slip,

40
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:20,740
you get sprayed more, you're
covered in water. By the way,

41
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,720
the water is not warm and then you got to,

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,410
cause you're going to
travel then 15 knots,

43
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:31,270
so you've got to fear facing
a 15 not headwind for another
two hours in a Zodiac,

44
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,210
and then you're going to get in the
water and swim. It would be deeply,

45
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,530
you're going to be cold.

46
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,060
That's just the way it is and you
can't complain about that. So,

47
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:43,150
and you don't complain about it in the
teams, you just keep your mouth shut.

48
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,440
That's what you do. Keep your mouth
shut. Now the big distinction here is,

49
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,220
this is correct.

50
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,270
If you're going to get hypothermia or
you're going to get a heat stroke or

51
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:55,030
you're going to go down from dehydration,
then yeah, you got to speak up and be,

52
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,110
you know you to say, Hey, guess what?
I got an issue here. I'm, I'm starting.

53
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,680
You know, I'm starting to get dizzy or
starting to get light headed or whatever.

54
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:02,891
Yeah.

55
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:07,891
If you cross the line to where it goes
from discomfort to actual problem,

56
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,300
then you definitely need to speak up.
Um,

57
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,970
and it does happen. It happens a
lot actually. You know, when we,

58
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,200
when we do our land warfare training
in the desert in the summertime,

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,330
it's 120 degree heat. Got Your, you're
going to take heat casualties. You know,

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,181
when I was running training,

61
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,420
we used to just have premeditated heat
casualty evacuation cause we knew someone

62
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:30,254
was going to go down.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,400
That's just the way it's going to happen
because you got 40 guys that are all

64
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,630
turning and burning and
they're all running on three
or four hours of sleep and

65
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,260
then they're going out in the field and
they just got back from the field and

66
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,590
there's no time to rehydrate.
You know, the, okay there's time,

67
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,130
but some guys might forget to
rehydrate and next thing you know,

68
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,420
you've got a guy going down.

69
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:57,010
So the stuff does happen and yeah,

70
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,150
you got to let your team know what's going
on. I've the, the closest call I had,

71
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:06,151
I was on a long patrol training patrol
in the Ozark mountains of Arkansas.

72
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,460
It was summertime, it was hot.
We were planning to pump water.

73
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,490
Meaning you bring a little
water filtration system into
the field and you get to

74
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:17,380
a stream and you can feel
your canteens and it's great.

75
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:20,650
And it seems like you have water
forever cause their streams, well we,

76
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,200
the way the patrol went,

77
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,300
we started off in pairs and then we linked
up with fire team and they need like

78
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,940
a couple of squad and you
look up with a platoon.

79
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:33,390
Well while we were in the squad
linkup we for whatever reason,

80
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:35,740
the course that I was on,
I didn't hit water.

81
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:38,890
We had a couple of streams that were
supposed to be there and they weren't

82
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,630
because they're intermittent streams.

83
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:44,470
So sometimes dreams are running year
round and the time of year it was,

84
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:47,200
the streams weren't running. So the
first one I was like okay, I'll be okay.

85
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,800
Gotcha. So you go up over a mountain,
come back down the other side,

86
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,770
get to this where the stream is marked,
intermittent stream is marked on a map.

87
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,630
Guess what? No stream. So now, and
then by that time I was out of water.

88
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,190
So now coming the next day
I said to myself, you know,

89
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:05,110
if there's not water on this next stream,
I'm going to,

90
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm going to have issues and there
wasn't water for the next day.

91
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,200
So yeah,
that's,

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,380
but I started to feel the
dehydration coming on me.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,990
That's why I hate being thirsty. I, Hey,

94
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,870
I always carry as much water as I can.
You,

95
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,600
you gotta be paranoid about being thirsty
and once you start going down from a

96
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:26,980
dehydration, it's really a bad
situation. You went the whole day. No,

97
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:31,060
it was two days. Yeah. I'm now, I had
water going in, but I didn't really feel,

98
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:34,840
I didn't have a ton of water. I should
have had it. I should've had one. Oh,

99
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,860
I should have maybe two more liters
of water as a, as a just in case,

100
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,560
but I didn't think need
got to carry. Yeah. Yeah.

101
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,060
Cause you know you've got to carry it.
Now you're heavier,

102
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,980
now you're sweating more.
So there's a little balance.

103
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:49,630
You've got to figure it out there.
But yeah, can it be a problem?

104
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,530
Yes, I have seen it become a problem
where we're guys, ego's too big,

105
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:56,170
they don't want to admit it for
sure. So yes, this is a good warning.

106
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,930
Don't your ego get you in real trouble
and that's going to hurt your platoon

107
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:02,930
even more.
So don't let that happen.

108
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:07,931
Don't let your ego prevent you from
telling the truth about what's happening.

109
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,430
And this happens in,
this can happen in the business world too,

110
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,460
where, Oh, you know what? Oh,

111
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:17,780
I don't really know how to
operate this piece of equipment,

112
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,450
but I'm not gonna say anything. I'm
just going to try and do it. Well,

113
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,120
that's how someone gets hurt.
So again, that's an ego problem.

114
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,440
When you have an issue,

115
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,930
when you know you can't do something
or you've never done something before,

116
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,260
step up and,
and raise your hand.

117
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,780
Now of course you should have done the
research. You should just, you know,

118
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,610
you should have figured some stuff out on
your own, but if you failed to do that,

119
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,380
don't dig the hole deeper. Raise
your hand. Say what the problem was.

120
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,530
There you go. Good
question. Yeah, makes sense.

121
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,940
Cause that especially the thirst thing,
like the dehydration thing a yeah.

122
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,750
You don't want to be the guy saying,
oh I'm thirsty. But here's the thing.

123
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:58,190
I think nowadays though, like teams
and coaches, here's the thing,

124
00:06:58,191 --> 00:07:01,970
in football case they'll pop Warner
football. They'd be like, yeah, no water.

125
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,630
You know we have a water break,
you drink water at the water break,

126
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,440
otherwise you're practicing,
you know kind of thing.

127
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,550
It's like a toughen you up thing. But
man, that can jam your health up. Yeah.

128
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:14,840
But let's face it. I mean it would be
pretty rare if you gave people the,

129
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,410
if you're doing a practice, what, how
long has the practice last? Two hours.

130
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:23,120
Two hours. Okay Bro, you can make it
two hours if you're properly hydrated.

131
00:07:23,121 --> 00:07:26,810
Now if a person is not properly hydrated
going into the practice, sure that can,

132
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,340
that can be a problem when if someone
is properly hydrated going into this

133
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:33,260
situation, it should not be a
problem. And I'll tell you what,

134
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,210
if you are in the military
and you're going in the field,

135
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,030
man pre hydrate like crazy.

136
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,390
That used to save me so much from caring
so much water and just drink so much

137
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:43,190
water. Now I'll tell you
where the problem comes in.

138
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,020
You're in a helicopter ride for an hour
and a half that you got to Piss so bad.

139
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,420
It's awful. Well you know
what, bring a little,

140
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,000
bring a little plastic bottle with
you so you can piss him the bottle.

141
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,770
That's the way less of an issue I think.

142
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,510
Like finding a place to drink
versus fee for sure. But yeah,

143
00:07:59,511 --> 00:08:03,470
if you pre hydrate properly,
no matter how hard you're working,

144
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:08,430
you can go like 12 hours without any
water, which is pretty legit for you.

145
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,520
You know,
kind of an average seal mission.

146
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:14,300
12 hours get you probably have plenty
of time. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean,

147
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:18,800
I'm talking pop Warner here so you know,
we're not talking about,

148
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,710
but here's the weird thing, like when
you went to high school, College,

149
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,310
they'd have water right there, right
there on the sideline, and they, you know,

150
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:31,670
they're really aware of, hey, you need
good, you need lots of drink more water.

151
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:35,860
You don't think that was also the time.
Yeah. That's actually the point. The era,

152
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,410
the era when we were kids,
no one ever,

153
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,690
ever one single time in my old,

154
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,140
from the time I was zero until
I was 18 no one ever said to me,

155
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:52,070
hey, make sure you drink water.
Never, never heard anyone
say that. It was like, oh,

156
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:55,820
you're thirsty. Drink a coke. Well,
you know, it's just the way it. Yup.

157
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,310
So that changed for you in that
time period. When I got to,

158
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,700
when I got to seal training, when I got
a buds, that's when they were saying, oh,

159
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:07,590
you got to stay hydrated. Yeah.
I thought it was kind of a joke.

160
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,760
I thought they were kidding
at first. Like, what are
you talking about? Hydrogen?

161
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,630
Me Drink water. What do
you, what do you mean?

162
00:09:12,631 --> 00:09:14,550
Why would you call it
something else hydrated?

163
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,860
We're Thursday this naive will,
you should,

164
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,090
cause you can go down from like heat
this for, there's heat exhaustion,

165
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:28,020
heat stroke, heat exhaustion. Yet there's
all kinds of heat injuries you can get.

166
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,800
Yeah. And you get heat stroke by, you can
straight up die. Oh yeah. So that's not,

167
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:34,680
you know, it's not a matter of
like, oh yeah, tough it out. Right.

168
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:38,820
You can't tough it out. You're shutting
down kind of thing. That's for sure. So,

169
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,710
you know, that is important. It's sort
of the heat thing. And I guess that is,

170
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,860
you know,
going back to this question,

171
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,050
that is probably why we would
see he casualties in training.

172
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,780
Because guys do not want to say
anything. They're like, man,

173
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:55,710
I'm not gonna say anything. I'm not
going to get an IUD and look even worse.

174
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,690
Cause that's what happens.
You get stuck with an ivy.

175
00:09:57,691 --> 00:09:59,640
Now you're laying in the field.
Everyone else, by the way,

176
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,080
it continues on doing another
tip kilometer hump to a
target and you're sitting

177
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:07,950
there laid up in the ambulance like
a little baby. No one wants that,

178
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,560
but pre high if you pre hydrate properly,
you won't be in that situation. Yeah,

179
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,800
but if you are going to get
that situation, you need
to say something. Yeah.

180
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,110
We're talking about your life essentially
and more important and we're talking

181
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:22,944
about the mission.

182
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,480
Yeah. Yeah. I'm still thinking about the
pot. We're in a situation, but yeah, man,

183
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:31,680
I dig it and you are correct.
I can't help but agree with you.

184
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,510
100% net question Jocko.
Dear Jocko,

185
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,850
my chosen community has lost and
continues to lose members due to suicide.

186
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,090
One reason is that they
don't ask for help.

187
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,730
I think one reason they don't ask for
help is that they're afraid of being or

188
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,620
being seen as weak.

189
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm aware that this takes strength
and discipline to be able to purse,

190
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,060
perceive when you need
help and to ask for it.

191
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,280
I don't know how to convey that to them.

192
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,170
Could you address how one
can gather support from their
team without losing face?

193
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,740
So there's an obvious reason why I paired
these two questions together because

194
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,060
they're both very, very similar.
And it's the same thing.

195
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,040
And if we don't,

196
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,210
if a member of your team won't come
forward and admit they have an issue,

197
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,620
then the issue is not
going to get addressed.

198
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,790
And this is the same exact thing that you
have to explain to your team. Like, Hey,

199
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,250
if you start going down because you're
dehydrated or your start getting d, uh,

200
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,080
getting frostbite and you need to get
warmed up, you need to say something.

201
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,320
If you don't say something that's
going to hurt the whole team,

202
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,220
that's what's bad. So, so
I think that's important.

203
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:47,790
I think that's important to make sure
everyone understands that this part of

204
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,840
being a good operator is
knowing your limitations.

205
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,550
And when you reach your limitations,
raising your hand and saying, Hey,

206
00:11:54,551 --> 00:11:58,680
this is a problem. And
believe me, there's,

207
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,400
there's guys that might complain about
little things and they're eventually

208
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:06,460
going to be labeled as a
little complainer, right?

209
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,690
And they don't really have issues.
So there's a fine line, right?

210
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,530
There's a fine line. But
for this one, you know,

211
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:19,180
for someone that's having some
kind of mental stress, well again,

212
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,620
we got to recognize what's going on.

213
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:23,590
We've got to recognize that it's
impacting us negatively at work.

214
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,210
So that means you got to raise your hand.

215
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,190
If it's having a negative impact
on the way you're performing,

216
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,390
then you got to raise your hand.

217
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,530
And I think it's important to explain
to people that this is something that

218
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,820
something that happens
to can happen to anybody.

219
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,920
And it's not a negative thing. It's
just a reality. It's, it's kind of like,

220
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:46,780
it reminds me of being afraid.
Right? And if, if, if you're,

221
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,160
let's say you got a new guy that's never
done anything before and he doesn't

222
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:54,010
know that he's going to be
afraid going on an operation,

223
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,640
then he's going to wonder why his stomach
is upset or why he's second guessing

224
00:12:59,641 --> 00:13:03,160
themselves or why he can't sleep.
Like, Oh, you can't sleep. Guess what?

225
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,540
That's normal. You're going on a
hardcore combat operation tomorrow.

226
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,640
The fact that you can't
sleep as completely normal,

227
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,890
the fact that you feel sick to
your stomach is completely normal.

228
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,460
The fact that you're, you're, you're
shaking, those things are normal.

229
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,400
Like you're going to feel those. That's
okay. It's not that big of a deal.

230
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,640
And those things are, are just
fear. That's what they are.

231
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,150
And if you know what they are and you
know that fear is okay and it's acceptable

232
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,120
and it's actually kind of
good, right? Because if,

233
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,350
if you're not feeling any fear whatsoever
all, then you know you've got some,

234
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,850
well you should be feeling afraid. You
should be, should feel fear that should,

235
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,580
that should propel you. It
should get you on edge. Those,

236
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:44,590
all those things are actually
happening for a reason.

237
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,480
So there's nothing wrong with that.

238
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:50,140
And I think that's the same thing that
you got explained to people with stress.

239
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,720
Like,
Oh okay that you can have too much fear.

240
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,620
You keep someone at that heightened
state for an extended period of time.

241
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,240
Well that's called combat stress
and it's real and it can happen.

242
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,650
It can happen to anyone.
And you know,

243
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,360
how many books have we talked about on
this podcast where you can see stress,

244
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:10,360
combat stress taking
its toll on people and

245
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,430
and when it does, you know we've
talked about it many times. P if you,

246
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:20,200
if you get to that point you need a
break and and Dick winters from band of

247
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:22,570
brothers, you know, he would give gloves,

248
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,210
guys breaks without them even knowing that
he was giving them a break and saying,

249
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,901
Oh hey echo,

250
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:28,840
you've got to go back and do a little
logistics run for four days and just make

251
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:32,020
sure we have more supplies coming our way.
Get you off the front line,

252
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,870
get you a breather. So that way, again,

253
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:39,250
the same metaphor I've used before is
if you have an engine in the red and you

254
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:41,710
keep running it, what's going to happen?
The engine, it's going to burn out.

255
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,700
It's not going to be usable.

256
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,000
If you have someone that's psychologically
stressed and they're in the red and

257
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:47,440
you keep running them in the red,
guess what?

258
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,820
Eventually you're not
going to be usable anymore.

259
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,040
So you need to give them a break,
get them off the line.

260
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,910
Because if you do take an engine,

261
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,450
if your engine like check engine light
comes on and you go and get it maintained,

262
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:59,660
get it fixed, the engine still
good. If you keep running it,

263
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,680
the engine will be destroyed.

264
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,380
So you've got to do that with your people
and you've got to make sure everybody

265
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:07,100
knows. And I think that's a real simple
metaphor to use with people as well. Say,

266
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:07,730
look,

267
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:11,870
we're running hard and we're going to
put some stress on the engine and if you

268
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,190
don't keep the engine maintained,

269
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,080
the engines is going to break and
you won't be any good to the team.

270
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,160
You won't be in good for the mission.

271
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,010
So if you start feeling
your engine light go on,

272
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,720
you got to let someone know so we can
give you the proper maintenance and that's

273
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:27,950
it. Jody Mitic talked about that
too. Jody was saying, Hey, you know,

274
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:32,390
basically if you get injured,
if you break your ankle,

275
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,690
they don't just expect you just
to keep going. No like, okay,

276
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:38,480
you need to get back and you needed to
rehab while the same thing had happened

277
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,000
to your brain.
Your brain gets a break in it.

278
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,060
You don't just keep driving or it's
going to fracture and fall apart.

279
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,310
What do you do? You, you take a break,

280
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,610
you get downtime and you get recovered
and then you'll be ready to rock and roll

281
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:56,420
again. So two really good questions
to start it off. You know, again,

282
00:15:56,421 --> 00:16:00,530
especially for folks out there on the
battlefield and then it's not just for

283
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:03,140
people on the battlefield
because it happens with any,

284
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,690
any group of people that are
in a stressful environment.

285
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,250
I mean obviously cops get put into a
really stressful environment all the time.

286
00:16:10,251 --> 00:16:13,880
Well, if you need to take a breather,
you need to say something before you,

287
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,470
before you burn out the engine. Yeah.
Same thing with business world, right?

288
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,750
People in the business world
get extremely stressed out.

289
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,980
Well you probably need a break at some
point. Make sure you work that in there.

290
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,170
Don't like, uh, like police have like a,

291
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,820
like a mandatory program or a
mandatory situation where you know,

292
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:35,391
you go through,

293
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:37,730
I think we'll like when they shoot
someone or something like that,

294
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,730
like mandatory. You have to go to
like some kind of like counseling.

295
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:46,040
Most of them do now. Yeah. Yeah. So that,
that makes sense too because even if,

296
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,790
let's say you don't necessarily
need it or whatever, right?

297
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,110
You'd go through a shooting situation,

298
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,180
you got to go mandatory and
then I got to go through.

299
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,410
But it's good that everyone kind of
does it because it seems like, oh,

300
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:01,490
it takes away the negative, the stigma,
you know, like kind of like, oh,

301
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,480
I'm the only guy, you know, I'm the
only guy that apparently feels this way.

302
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:09,230
I'm looking around. No one else is going
to counseling and now I'm the only guy,

303
00:17:09,231 --> 00:17:11,930
I must be the weak guy, so I don't,
I'm going to know. And they do that.

304
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,570
They've done that somewhat
in the military of, Hey,

305
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:18,110
when you come home from deployment,
everyone's going to go talk to uh,

306
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,400
talk to what does it a psychotherapy
therapist or psychologist.

307
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,880
They kind of do that. I know they did
that in the seal teams where they'd be,

308
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:29,180
everyone would go,
they didn't do while I was in,

309
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,490
they give you like a piece
of paper to fill out,

310
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,590
which everyone just kind of gun deck,
you know,

311
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,440
it just pencil whip. I don't
know what, just like, you know,

312
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,240
fill it out except for Tony. You know
what Tony wrote on the, the head of his,

313
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,660
what he wrote.
This is a cry for help.

314
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,800
That was pretty funny.
But in the west that was,

315
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,860
he filled out like a whole fake
one about just a funny one.

316
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

317
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,350
But it makes sense though because of that,
because that's kind of the,

318
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,590
yeah, that's really smart way to do
thing. It's the smart way to do things.

319
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:10,760
Let's give everyone a, let's give
everyone a baseline sort of, okay. Check.

320
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:14,420
Here you go. Yeah. And that
way no one's, no one has to go.

321
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,790
No one has to take raise
their hand first. Right? Yeah.

322
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,250
You're all going to talk to somebody.
I think it's a smart thing to do.

323
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah. Cause it's kind of the thing, right?

324
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,070
It kind of goes along with
the earlier question too.

325
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:29,750
Like if it's a water break and hey guys,
water break, everyone's drinking water.

326
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,260
So now it's like you don't
have to feel like, Ooh,

327
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,450
the one plus

328
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,530
who like me to use water. Oh you
know, kind of thing. Oh yeah. Yeah.

329
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,410
This exact same thing.

330
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:46,680
Yeah. Hey Man. So yeah, if you've got an
issue, man, speak up. Let everyone know.

331
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,310
You know, that way you can do your job,
you can do it longer, you can do a better,

332
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,370
your goal is to do the,
is to be the best possible.

333
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:58,371
That you be the best possible capability
so that you can go out and do your job

334
00:18:59,611 --> 00:19:01,680
the best if you're,
if you got issues,

335
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:05,590
you got to say something so that you can
keep doing your job for the team. Yeah.

336
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,840
It's like, I'm like, don't
look at yourself as being weak.

337
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,570
Look at yourself is trying to optimize
your strength, kind of, you know?

338
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,980
Maybe just flip over the way you look,
look at it and whatever. There it is.

339
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,623
Next question.

340
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,550
Do you think martial arts tournaments
are the most effective way for preparing

341
00:19:23,551 --> 00:19:26,400
for physical confrontation?
I just competed in my first,

342
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,430
my second do just the tournament as a
three straight white belt in one match.

343
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,660
I completely lost focus and control of
my mind because I believe I was taken

344
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:41,400
aback by the strength and wildness
of my opponent. Amen, man. I dig it.

345
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,590
Hundred percent I barely,
I can barely even remember how my,

346
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,830
how the match unfolded.

347
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,330
I've given this match significant thought
and I concluded that I need to compete

348
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,650
more. I'm very calm. I'm very
comfortable with everyone in my academy.

349
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,060
I trust the desert role with
without question. They're
like family. Now. The Guy,

350
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,150
the guy in the tournament
was a total stranger.

351
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,230
He was unknown and therefore elicited
fear. I allowed myself to be,

352
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,940
to be crippled by fear.

353
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,380
Is there any other way to overcome
this beyond competing in tournaments?

354
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:15,330
Thank you.
All right.

355
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,760
You know,

356
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,760
competing is definitely part of it and
it's interesting [inaudible] he's asking

357
00:20:23,191 --> 00:20:27,210
if this is the most effective way to
prepare for a physical confrontation.

358
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,750
It is a very good way to PR to help you
prepare for a physical confrontation and

359
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:36,990
the bottom line is competing.
One of the things that competing,

360
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,550
one of the things that that's true with
competing and it's true with anything is

361
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,610
that the more familiar you
are with the unfamiliar,

362
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,010
the more familiar it will be calm.
Yeah,

363
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,560
I know that sounds pretty obvious,

364
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,530
but the more familiar you
are with the unfamiliar,

365
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:55,360
the more familiar it will become.

366
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:59,140
So you get to become familiar with things
that are unfamiliar and you learn how

367
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:03,550
to handle things that you
weren't expecting in the teams.

368
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:06,700
We always talked about that your
first free fall jump when you're,

369
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:11,200
when you're learning how to skydive with
the freefall rig and they're your first

370
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:14,500
jump, seems like it's, it's like three
seconds long. Even though it's a minute,

371
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,920
even though it's a minute because you're
just, you're all amped up and you,

372
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:20,950
all you see is your altimeter
and the more you jump,

373
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,370
the more you see until that minute.
I mean,

374
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,730
have you ever had tried to hold
your breath for a minute? Yes.

375
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,990
That's like a long time, right? But

376
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,270
and that's,

377
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,630
that's the amount of time that can take
up a free fall can be a nice long minute

378
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:36,250
where you're observing all
these different things.

379
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,100
But when he first started doing it,
it doesn't seem very long.

380
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,130
I'm sure if we had Andy,
you know Andy Stumpf on here,

381
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,550
his one minute free fall
price seems like a really,

382
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:49,330
really long time because he's
got thousands of of jumps.

383
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,750
And so this is the same thing.

384
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,880
The more you train for chaos,

385
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,600
the more custom you're going
to become to the chaos.

386
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,350
Now what's great is in this particular
case he's talking about this guy's just

387
00:22:05,351 --> 00:22:08,950
wild and crazy and hey,
if you survive it that first time will,

388
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,780
the next time someone goes wild
and crazy, you're like, okay,

389
00:22:10,781 --> 00:22:13,750
well here's what I needed to do.
Need to put this in check. I need to,

390
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,531
I need to hold on,

391
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:17,680
I need to make sure I don't give any
positions but I'm not going to get crazy.

392
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:18,930
I'm just going to absorb some.

393
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,470
You go through that mental drill and the
more you go through that mental drove a

394
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,470
battle, you better you will
get at it. And this is true,

395
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,740
this is true with anything.
And, and that's why, you know,

396
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:33,190
when I was running in seal training,
we put the we, we would make it.

397
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:37,570
So we hit people with the most random
hospital things because that's what

398
00:22:37,571 --> 00:22:40,270
prepares you for random possible
things is random possible things.

399
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,630
That's what you want to deal with. It's
kind of weird, you know, in Jujitsu,

400
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,240
Dean Dean used to talk about this
and now you can hear John, Donna,

401
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,830
her talking about it as well.
And if,

402
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,670
if you have never been in
a certain situation before,

403
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,040
you're not ready for it. And when, okay,
so there's a, there's a position in,

404
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:03,640
in Jujitsu called 50 50 right,
that's what it's called now.

405
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,170
We used to call it cocker Reiko because
that's the position that dean was in

406
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:12,520
when he beat a guy named Cocker Rinko
for the ADCC world championships.

407
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:13,923
And

408
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:20,190
Dean Dean calls that position 90 10
because he's been in it so much that even

409
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:21,940
though it's a neutral position,

410
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:25,180
meaning we both have the same
advantages and disadvantages.

411
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,620
When deans in that position,

412
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,590
he's been in it so much that he's got
a 90% chance he's got a 90% chance of

413
00:23:30,591 --> 00:23:34,750
success because he's been there 10
times, 20 times, 30 times more than you.

414
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,810
And I heard John Dawn, her talking
about the same thing the other day.

415
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,000
He's getting Pete, you know, his,

416
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:45,060
his Jujitsu fighters right now are
doing things to guys that are these,

417
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,290
they're, they're putting people in
positions that the person's not used to.

418
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,390
So if you're not used to it,
guess what? You're an advantage.

419
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:51,920
Even though I might have trained,
even though,

420
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:55,610
let's say I'm a Jiu Jitsu black belt
and I've been training for 20 years,

421
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:59,990
if I've never been in this
particular position before,

422
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,540
it's I might as well be a
white belt in that positioning.

423
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,390
You can see that happening.
You can see that happening in Jujitsu.

424
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:09,380
That's why when somebody comes
up with a new new type of moves,

425
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,010
that move can be effective for
a little while. Like let's say,

426
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,210
let's say you came up with a new move.

427
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,600
You might catch me in that new
move one time and then I go, oh,

428
00:24:17,601 --> 00:24:20,660
I know what he did, but if, but
now if instead of just a new move,

429
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:24,290
you had a whole new area that
I had to learn all. Yeah.

430
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,020
Then I had had to learn
a whole new deal around.

431
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,230
It's the same thing with Eddie Bravo
and 10th planet. You know, like they,

432
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:33,380
they were doing things like, oh, I've
never been in this position before.

433
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:36,440
Now what do I do?
And they were catching guys like that.

434
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,790
And then the more people figured
out that part of that system, okay,

435
00:24:40,791 --> 00:24:43,760
well then you get better at it and
we get to a neutral ground again.

436
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,250
But anytime you can,
so in training,

437
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:49,970
anytime you can get to be put yourself
in a situation that you haven't been

438
00:24:49,971 --> 00:24:52,660
before, it's going to be beneficial
to you. Now what does it,

439
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,020
how does this translate to real
physical confrontations, right?

440
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,860
How do you train for that? Well, how often
are you putting on gloves and Jujitsu?

441
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,860
How often are you having
somebody punched you in the face?

442
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:07,380
How often are you having somebody
come up and push you around that?

443
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,400
How often are you having people do things
that people have been doing a street

444
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,810
fight,
right?

445
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,780
That people are going to do in a street
fight that they wouldn't normally do in

446
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,540
a Jujitsu match, right? For
instance, in a street fight,

447
00:25:17,541 --> 00:25:21,390
does anyone ever start on the niece,
right?

448
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,600
They don't start on the nose.
They don't.

449
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,460
So you don't start on the knees and
street fight. You don't say, Hey,

450
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:26,560
you want to fight me?
And then you,

451
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,670
then you get down on your knees
and so does the other guy.

452
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:31,640
Now we figure out what happens.
No street fights don't start on the knees.

453
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,570
So you're almost, and people
ask me, this is actually,

454
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,470
somebody asked me the other day,

455
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:40,070
w w what should I do when starting from
the knees? What's a good take down?

456
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,880
I'm like, oh, pull guard. Because
why are you on your knees? Yeah.

457
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,780
The best thing to do if your
opponent is on their knees,

458
00:25:44,781 --> 00:25:48,350
stand up and kick them in the face,
right?

459
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,230
Because you're not going to be, if you're,
why would you be on your knees? Yeah.

460
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,150
So don't practice that.
So how do you prepare for,

461
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,320
the best way to prepare for these
combat situations is, is uh,

462
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,070
is Jujitsu tournament a good way?
Yes, it is. A good way. Is Boxing,

463
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:07,640
is boxing a good way?
Is it good to do a smokers?

464
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,170
So you figured out what
it's like when somebody,

465
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,330
some you want to talk about
with someone going wild.

466
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,420
Wait til you get someone that's untrained
in boxing. Come throne, the throne,

467
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,410
you know,
windmill haymakers at you 38 in a row.

468
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,390
Now they're going to be exhausted
after that first 32 seconds. But,

469
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,640
but you will,

470
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:28,340
I would have had to have withstand and
not get punched in the head. You know,

471
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,590
cause if you get punched in
the head by a while, hey maker,

472
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,360
I don't care who you are.
If they connect with your chin,

473
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,830
there's a possibility you might go down.
So you need to be careful of that. So,

474
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,510
so don't just think, oh just Jujitsu.
Hey go out, train some boxing,

475
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:43,980
train some boy tie and go and

476
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,930
spark. And if you can do a smoker's
cause it's smokers. Pretty easy to do.

477
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,850
In other words, you don't need
to, you don't need to, uh,

478
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,180
do like a full preparation
camp and all that. Yeah,

479
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,100
it's an unofficial event.

480
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,940
So you go do a smokers and you're going
to experience somebody going wild on you,

481
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,380
throwing haymakers at you, throwing
crazy kicks at you. Do that,

482
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,640
do all these things to get ready for
those physical confrontations. And then,

483
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,750
then you also on top of that,
you read and you look at youtube videos.

484
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,610
Go Watch Youtube.
I've talked about this before.

485
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,790
Go watch youtube videos of street fights
because you get to see what people,

486
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:23,580
what kind of things people do,
which,

487
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:27,540
which can be very effective,
right? You need to watch,

488
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:30,540
learn to watch out for soccer punches.
You need to learn to watch out,

489
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,150
watch your back and watch you sneaking
up on you and be aware of your

490
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,950
surroundings and put your back
against the wall. You know,

491
00:27:34,951 --> 00:27:37,020
there's all these little things that
you can do to make sure that you're not

492
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:41,010
going to get sucker punched, but you've
got to pay attention to those things,

493
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,080
you know? Yeah. That was that
wildness that he talks about.

494
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,200
That is a huge thing.
It's like a whole nother factor where,

495
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:54,630
especially in exactly
how he said he's real,

496
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,720
he's real familiar with his
training partners. So men, you know,

497
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,460
the amount of cruising and kind of
relax and even during the role there's

498
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:05,430
probably a significant amount of it
almost to the point where it seems like

499
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:09,120
anyway where he kind of maybe
expect that or you know,

500
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:10,590
even subconsciously kind of he,

501
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:12,630
he understands that that's
kind of part of the deal.

502
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,830
You go against a complete
stranger and he gets wild.

503
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,980
Then it's like Whoa, this is
like, it's kind of overwhelming.

504
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,350
And also even at the three
stripe white belt level. Yeah.

505
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,860
This other guy, he may,
he's got his little game,

506
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,420
he's got his game that he plays and
there's a chance that as a three stripe

507
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:37,680
white belt, you haven't learned that
part of the game. So it just feels crazy.

508
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,170
Yeah. And that whole, you know, when
you compete for the first, second time,

509
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,750
you know, just a at the earlier, see
that's the thing is the more you train,

510
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:50,610
the less holes there are. Right. The last
holes you are there are in your game.

511
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,250
And so if you're a three straight white
belt, you might not have good, uh,

512
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,720
guard replacement. Yeah. Right.

513
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:01,500
Like you really haven't learned how to
replace the guard from cross side. Well,

514
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:05,640
if this guy happens to be a guy that
holds really well across the side and

515
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,920
that's where he works his game
from, man, you're in big trouble,

516
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,450
you're in big trouble.

517
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,980
And it all seems so unpredictable too at
those earlier stages because you don't

518
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:17,190
know where your holes are. I mean, you,
you might know some, but you don't know,

519
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:17,730
you know,

520
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,420
you haven't seen enough of the game and
you haven't been in enough situations

521
00:29:21,421 --> 00:29:25,110
where you, you can kind of stay
calm and you know, all this stuff.

522
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,760
So to your point where you say you got
to be familiar with the unfamiliar kind

523
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:33,870
of thing, remember when
[inaudible] started just
baseball bat choking everyone.

524
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,250
Yeah. Yeah. These little weird setups.

525
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,470
And he would let people pass as
guard and he, they'd be thinking, oh,

526
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:43,720
I'm about to score some points on that and
boom, they're getting tapped out. Yeah.

527
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,900
It was so foreign that, okay, so he went,

528
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,330
the two real real famous ones at the
time when he exploded on the scene with

529
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:57,100
these was he was Clark and Zack
Max through there's two matches.

530
00:29:57,101 --> 00:29:58,210
And one of them,

531
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,760
Zach Maxwell had mounted in arm bar.
No, hasn't been the arm bar. Meanwhile,

532
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:06,880
baseball choke is in not,

533
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:09,640
but who cares because
really that rule not rule,

534
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,670
but that situation of kind of applies.
If you have someone in the arm bar,

535
00:30:12,671 --> 00:30:16,600
I don't care, he choked me up to break
your arm, but he's going for the arm,

536
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:19,870
but he can't lean back because
baseball that chokes in and he's like,

537
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,070
he got a tap, you've got a
straight up tat. And then, uh,

538
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,430
I think he was Clark where he could've
been the other way around. But either way,

539
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,560
Clark has a smile. I was better
at these matches, weren't
we? I know I was. Yeah. No,

540
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,100
I wasn't. I was there, I saw
the videos. But um, yeah,

541
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,620
the kind of where Clark was like,
I know this joke,

542
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,790
I'm in Maui or I'm in this good position.
I know that this choke doesn't work.

543
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,970
It simply doesn't work cause I have the
advocate and he gets choked unconscious

544
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:47,380
cause he doesn't tap.
Sure it might hurt.

545
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,490
And that is the case for a lot of jokes
where it's like sure this her, no, no,

546
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:55,090
no don't, no, a good one doesn't
even hurt. Yeah. It's just a joke.

547
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:58,880
It just in the, so what we're talking
about there is a guy named measured,

548
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:02,680
what's machines last name? Age.
Yeah, that's right. And he,

549
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,120
he came onto the scene we'll say with,

550
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,870
well this is what's interesting about
this is the baseball bat choke is not a

551
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:14,620
new choke. Yeah. It's not a domain
that people were unfamiliar with.

552
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,810
It's just that he was doing it really,

553
00:31:16,811 --> 00:31:20,480
really well with really good
setups that people, that's what,

554
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,350
that's the part that people weren't
expecting. It was a really good setup.

555
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,000
They really going to set up so people
weren't expecting and so he let people

556
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:31,540
pass their guard or his guard,
but he had the token,

557
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:33,700
they'd get across side and
get mounted or whatever.

558
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,260
Go for arm locks and they're tapping.
Yeah. Because they weren't expecting it.

559
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,900
Yeah. And even if those, you know,

560
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:45,340
I mean Zach Maxwell and Clark Gracie,
but just phenomenal competitors.

561
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,280
Blackbelt Jujitsu,
I mean been training their whole lives.

562
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,770
Both of them got caught
by that by, yeah. The,

563
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,440
the,
the legitimacy of like,

564
00:31:56,441 --> 00:32:00,340
the way that whole thing went
down was just so astounding. Like,

565
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:05,341
just like how you said like Clark Clark
has been winning stuff from day one and

566
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:11,230
then, yeah. And yeah, it was just crazy.
But it just shows, you know where you can,

567
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,090
you can be that good. You get just that
one teeny tiny window of unfamiliarity.

568
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:20,680
Yeah. They guy creeps in there and he's
familiar, but he'll just have his way.

569
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,270
And then what was interesting is as people
started knowing that that's what he's

570
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:27,250
going to go for it, but
he'd still get it. Yeah.

571
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:32,310
And actually he and I trained with him
before for know a few times or whatever

572
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:36,630
and he didn't do that to me. And I
was like, hey, you know, like Wah,

573
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,160
I didn't have to him, why didn't he
do it to me? But I was, do people,

574
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,010
you know like does everyone asks you
to teach them or what did he's like,

575
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:46,400
you know what people don't w I don't even
really talk about anymore because I've

576
00:32:46,401 --> 00:32:49,970
become so well known for
that move that it becomes,

577
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,200
it became less a part of my life. He said,
I was like, well, it can happen to where,

578
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,000
okay, now once you go, okay, it
goes through a phase of, hey,

579
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:02,300
I wasn't expecting that and it
worked because I wasn't expecting it.

580
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,750
Then it goes like, hey, I was
expecting it but it still worked.

581
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,390
But then it gets to a point where people
are just going, I'm not gonna do it.

582
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:10,000
You're like, Oh, if he grabbed my collar,

583
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:13,250
I need to go in a totally different
direction. I need to not do anything,

584
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,210
I need to back out, whatever. And
then it becomes where, like you said,

585
00:33:17,211 --> 00:33:21,980
it's an now it's loses
some of its effectiveness
because everyone is expecting

586
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:23,720
that to be the move that you do.

587
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,880
That's what happened with Dean
Paul a hundred percent sure.

588
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,450
Like where there'd be like,
I don't care what position that I'm in,

589
00:33:29,451 --> 00:33:33,500
I don't care what position I have to
give up and just do not get into that leg

590
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,800
lock position and you can tell when
someone is bachelors. I was like,

591
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,780
I get it, I get it. But you
know man that is how it goes.

592
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,340
But the chaos thing,
I think he should compete more.

593
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,230
Yes I should compete more for sure.

594
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:53,000
But what I'm saying is compete in
Jujitsu for sure, but do some smokers,

595
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,680
do some more Thai, do some wrestling
matches, do some samba. You know,

596
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:59,810
get out there,
do some different competitions.

597
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:04,640
And then on top of all of that man
do some scenario based training.

598
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:05,181
You know,

599
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:09,510
do some self defense based training at
the academy where somebody pulls out the,

600
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,300
the, the, the knife, the
fake knife, whatever.

601
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,250
Would it would they call the fake knife
and like let's make sure we know how to

602
00:34:16,251 --> 00:34:19,040
deal with that. Let's make sure we
not to deal with a baseball bat.

603
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:22,190
Like what are you going to do? What
are you gonna do? Cause Baseball Bat,

604
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,550
you know what to do with baseball back
close the distance, you know, hey that's,

605
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:28,460
that's,
that's not even really a game changer.

606
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,910
As long as you know what you're doing,
knife goes the distance with a knife,

607
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:36,540
now you're getting stabbed this problem.
Yeah. So you got to make distance. Yeah.

608
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:40,790
It again, men that just, that
familiarity, like once you go through it,

609
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,000
that's like almost night and day in
and of itself. Once you've seen it,

610
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,190
if you've never seen it visited,
if you seen it in once,

611
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:49,670
like first step is night and day.
So that's good that he went through this.

612
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,630
Really. Yeah. Yeah. And what's
the other good? Psychologically?

613
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:56,930
Nobody recognized psychological.
He recognized that he lost his mind.

614
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,950
What he said. He said, uh, I fear. Yeah,

615
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:06,710
I got fear. What was it in one match?

616
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:10,150
I completely lost focus and
control of my mind. So once you,

617
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,270
that's what you just said.
When you get that you experienced that,

618
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,600
that's a good thing to experience
because then you learn to recognize that

619
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:20,450
you're losing control and you're losing
your mind and you're going to, when you,

620
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,390
when you realize that it allows you to
start monitoring it if you've never been,

621
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,091
because there's people,

622
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,730
we'll let her listen to this right now
that have never lost their mind before.

623
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,300
They've never been overwhelmed by
something and just not knowing what to do.

624
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,650
Never been frozen.

625
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,640
You ever been frozen with fear frozen
with fear if never felt your fight or

626
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:42,550
flight thing engaged and when it
happens you won't know what it is. Yeah.

627
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,240
You want to know what it is so that
way when it happens you can go, okay,

628
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,780
I know what's happening right here.
I'm going to make this,

629
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,500
I'm going to make this decision yet.

630
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,400
And now you're saying
when you train boxing or

631
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,060
boxing? Yeah, yeah and MMA. So
when you get hit in the face,

632
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:01,710
and we talked about this before,
when you get hit in the face,

633
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:05,980
then you haven't really been hit
in the face before. Like that's a,

634
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,440
it'll throw you off. Oh, put
really Miley, it'll throw you off.

635
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:13,290
So especially, yeah, you're right.

636
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,920
Because when you see someone get punched
in the face and a movie and it seems

637
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:19,200
like it's doesn't really phase
him that much and they keep going,

638
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,260
if that's what you expect is going to
happen when you get punched in the face,

639
00:36:22,261 --> 00:36:23,190
that's the wrong idea.

640
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,920
Because what's going to re if you've
never been punched in the face before,

641
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:28,180
when you get punched, it's
a little shocker. Yeah.

642
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,580
And there's pain and your eyes get blurry
and you're, you get a little flash.

643
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:32,791
I mean,

644
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,340
there's a lot of things that go on when
you get punched in the face once you get

645
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,070
used to where you're like, yeah, you can
move right through it. Exactly. Yeah.

646
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,580
But if you're not used to it, it's
a problem. Yeah, fully. And it's,

647
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,710
that's another one.

648
00:36:43,711 --> 00:36:47,820
It's night and day when a guide has been
hit in the face a bunch of times and is

649
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:48,271
used to it.

650
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:53,271
And a guy who's not used to it because
you know how like you can hit a guy in a

651
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:57,600
face or get hit in the face
and there'll be like, I'm done.

652
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,640
Like I didn't really
expect this encounter,

653
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,020
this experience you don't want to get.
And then other guys,

654
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,390
they'll give him the face, break
their nose, break their jaw,

655
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:08,820
all this stuff in there, keep
fighting, you know, it's like Dang.

656
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,150
So that night and the situation,
if you're not used to it,

657
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:14,970
which is essentially the same thing
you went through, this guy went wild.

658
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,970
He wasn't ready for this overwhelming
experience and he lost his mind turning to

659
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,320
him. Yeah. So you get him the face.

660
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:27,321
Like I remember Greg punching me in my
face so hard where I don't know if he was

661
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:30,230
mad or,
or just just

662
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,730
Greg James fires it off.
He punched me right between the eyes,

663
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,990
thought he broke my face and it was the
kind of where it was a timing thing too

664
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:40,830
where I came in,

665
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:44,010
I was shooting in and right before
a level change to whatever he,

666
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,550
it just connected and I was like boom.
And I remember thinking,

667
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:49,830
cause I just kept going and
I remember thinking, Dang,

668
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm glad I was kind of used to getting
hit in the face because that would kind

669
00:37:52,741 --> 00:37:55,760
of at the very least paused me for a
long time. Like didn't he would've,

670
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,220
but when you imagine just that kind of
chaos and sensation that'll just stop

671
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:03,630
you. But once you're
used to it, you're good.

672
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:07,610
And this is a good point to bring up
with just with any kind of training like

673
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,750
leadership training,
right?

674
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,180
When you have leaders that haven't
been put in certain situations before,

675
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,580
that's why Ashland Front,

676
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,520
we do like role playing exercises with
people and you put people in situations

677
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:20,880
the first time you put them in
situations like dealing with a hostile

678
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:24,540
subordinate that doesn't want to do the
plan the first time they'd get put in

679
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:28,620
that scenario. They just Lou,
they just fall apart. No,

680
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:30,810
I told you to do it and here's,
I'm like, okay, let's replay that.

681
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,380
By the third time you're doing it,
are already handling the job,

682
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,000
handling the scenario infinitely better.

683
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,540
Infinitely better than they
did the first time. Yeah.

684
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,070
So it's the same with everything in life.

685
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:46,930
Like the exposure to it and the
rehearsal of it gives you such a massive

686
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:51,730
advantage that to not
rehearse and to not train is,

687
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,500
it's actually sad and that's actually
the national front's a great example

688
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,770
because that's why we're
in business because people,

689
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:02,650
people don't even know that they
should be doing this, you know, and,

690
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:07,651
and to go to a company that
has 50 100150200 leaders
that are leading teams and

691
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:17,200
they have no leadership training and
therefore we're all surprised when the

692
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,750
leader doesn't get the teams to do
what they're supposed to do. Well, who,

693
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,350
who taught him how to lead because
you just don't show, he just not,

694
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,020
you just don't show up to
work knowing how to lead. No,

695
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:31,021
you actually get trained to lead all these
unfamiliar micro scenarios happening.

696
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,630
That's, that's one of
the, I got the muster.

697
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:37,850
We'd do these little drills at the
muster and you could see people are,

698
00:39:37,851 --> 00:39:42,460
are overwhelmed with the knowledge
that they gain from two or three little

699
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:43,840
scenarios that we put in front of them.

700
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,820
And these are common stairs
that happened all the time.

701
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:50,821
But when you watch seasoned business
leaders trying to handle a scenario that

702
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,160
they haven't seen before,
now they might've seen it before,

703
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:56,740
but they never actually had to
deal with it the first time.

704
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,350
They try and deal with it, they
fall apart. Yeah. And it's real.

705
00:39:59,351 --> 00:40:02,380
I would say it takes like 10
seconds before you go, okay,

706
00:40:02,381 --> 00:40:05,050
let's just stop because you've
already got this guy mad at you.

707
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,100
Well let's try this again because we
haven't been sued the situation before.

708
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:13,930
They never been punched in
the face before. Yeah. And
that's the problem. Yeah.

709
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:17,740
Don't let it happen. Get punched in
the face a few times to be, yeah,

710
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,700
you can do this. It's kind of like, I
remember when we were kids, there's this,

711
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,720
there's this gut, you know, like
Wrigley's chewing gum, the little packs,

712
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:28,730
four or five of them, small
little thing. And you know,

713
00:40:28,731 --> 00:40:31,690
you grab one and this one kind of
sticky. Now you can say, hey, you know,

714
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,430
do you want one offer,
one of your friends.

715
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,450
So it was my brother and
he did the long story,

716
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,550
but he was crying from
something else who said,

717
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:42,790
and he was like crying and oh by the
way, you know, he offers me some gum.

718
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:43,511
I grabbed the gum.

719
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:47,080
It's one of those miles trap and it slaps
you and then kind of hurts when you're

720
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:51,820
a little kid anyway, and it snaps
a fan. I'm like, Dang, I never,

721
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:53,200
you know,
I see he's laughing.

722
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,800
He was crying from something else and
then he's laughing, cheered him up,

723
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:01,570
whatever, double leg it was up there for,

724
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:04,510
well actually, which would have made
the double lake even better nonetheless.

725
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:06,670
I had never seen that before.

726
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:10,270
Now someone offers me Wrigley's gum.

727
00:41:10,271 --> 00:41:13,750
I'm aware I'm ready for that mouse trap.
Maybe the muster at may be not,

728
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,530
but you're grabbing by the
side of the program or the
site. Exactly right. Listen,

729
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,700
learn. Yeah, exactly. Right.

730
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:20,590
I don't have to take it into
her that I won't lose my mind.

731
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,260
Life is no different.
Next question.

732
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen.

733
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,100
I'm second in command overseeing a large
kitchen staff, part of a five person

734
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,590
management team overseeing
the entire account.

735
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:41,390
Recently during my last review I was
given some advice by my boss and his boss.

736
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,880
I'm unsure about my last two annual
reviews have gone very well and I'm on the

737
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,770
rise in the company.
However,

738
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:52,160
they said if it was important
for me to get or heat.

739
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:57,190
However they said it was important for
me to give up some of my kitchen dog

740
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,120
mentality

741
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:05,860
and work to showcase my artistic side
and embrace more of a star role in the

742
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:10,970
spotlight, get out of the kitchen
a bit more, gain more exposure.

743
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,520
Specifically with our
high profile clients.

744
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,450
While they appreciate their sentiment
and respect their big management skills.

745
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Their style isn't one I strive to emulate
or feel would work for me and the way

746
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:28,040
I operate, I have always approached my
work is more of a craft than an art.

747
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:31,760
And I've always like being a trench,
dug with my team,

748
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,290
my team responds to it and I get results
for the business and I feel the results

749
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:41,090
should speak for themselves. It is
propelled my career rapidly thus far.

750
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,090
So why would I want to change
and be something I'm not?

751
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Should I heed their advice or stick to
what I do best and keep getting asked.

752
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,580
Great on my terms

753
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,380
was just funny how,

754
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,760
how that last statement
is framed, right? Yeah.

755
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,210
Should I stick to what I do best and
keep getting after it as if to say,

756
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:04,050
if you say no,

757
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:08,730
you should not stick to what you do best
and you should not get after it. Right.

758
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,210
That's, that's the frame
there. And actually this guy,

759
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,840
I answered the question real tersely.

760
00:43:15,841 --> 00:43:18,910
I think this came through Facebook
messages that, you know, I said, uh,

761
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,350
sounds like you found a comfortable zone
for yourself and you want to stay in

762
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,270
their little cold butter and
responds. And he's like, ah,

763
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:32,271
I knew it because as we know in a
comfort zone there was no growth in the

764
00:43:32,431 --> 00:43:36,990
comfort zone. So it's interesting
this guy is actually getting some,

765
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:41,340
some good solid and straight forward
advice from up the chain of command.

766
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:42,773
Uh,

767
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,200
plus I think if they have him as more of
a personality than the restaurant will

768
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:51,720
do better and they're trying to build
their reputation and your reputation at

769
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:54,600
the same time. And that seems
pretty reasonable to me. Right?

770
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,300
And I'm not real familiar
with the restaurant business,

771
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,420
but I'm familiar enough to know if you've
got a good reputation with the staff

772
00:44:02,611 --> 00:44:04,740
that works at the restaurant.
It brings in more people,

773
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,620
like there's no doubt about
it, the, the relationship,

774
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:08,790
just like any other business,

775
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:13,350
the relationships that you build
with the customers strengthens them,

776
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:16,830
strengthens that relationship and makes
them want to come back for more. Right?

777
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:21,270
That's the way it works. And so
for them to say to you, hey man,

778
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,930
hey, you know you're a good cook. We
get that, but we need a little bit more.

779
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,760
We want a little bit more chef. We
need somebody that has, yeah, chef.

780
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:34,710
Sorry. You're, yeah, yeah.
Sorry. You're a good chef. Well,

781
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:39,690
actually what I think I might've
actually purposely said that like, hey,

782
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:42,840
you're doing a good job
in the kitchen as a cook.

783
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,300
We don't need someone that's
just cooking the food.

784
00:44:45,301 --> 00:44:49,320
We need a chef with a reputation
with a personality. Right.

785
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:54,090
There's a difference there,
right? Yes sir. So it was
called out for reason. Gotcha.

786
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,630
He's happy. And you can see
like kitchen dog. Yeah. He's
proud of that, right? Yeah.

787
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:04,140
And I get that, man. I get that. I
get that. Like you're one of the boys,

788
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:07,290
you're back in the, in
the grind. Well let me,

789
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,050
let me ask you this or let
me make this statement.

790
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:14,340
Guess what you have to do as a seal, as
a CEO leader, guess what you have to do?

791
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,110
You have to build relationships.

792
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:19,920
You have to make your
commanding officer trust you.

793
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:21,750
You have to build
relationships with the army.

794
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:24,420
You have to build relationships with
the Marine Corps. You have to end.

795
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:26,850
In order to do that,
you have to like raise your hand.

796
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:29,820
You have to call a little bit of attention
to yourself and raise your hand and

797
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:34,660
say, Hey, this is who I am. You
have to take, this is who I am. You.

798
00:45:34,661 --> 00:45:38,910
You have to actually have to step into
the spotlight a little bit so that you

799
00:45:38,911 --> 00:45:42,030
can let people know who you are.
Because if people don't know who you are,

800
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,680
how do you have a relationship with him?

801
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,060
And if you don't have relationship with
people, how can they trust you? So, so

802
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,760
that's part of it, right? That's part
of what they're asking you to do. Now,

803
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,100
in all seriousness, if, if you
really don't want to do it,

804
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,090
well then you can keep being the guy
that's in the back. And guess what?

805
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,870
You're going to be mad in six months
when some other chef gets hired for a

806
00:46:06,871 --> 00:46:09,930
different shift and all of a sudden he's
out making friends with everyone and he

807
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:13,920
gets promoted. And why does he get
promoted? Well, look what the guy's doing,

808
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,750
but he's not as good as,
he's not as good as a cook as I am.

809
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:21,060
Guess what?
They don't really care.

810
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,080
Being making the food is only
part of what they want you to do.

811
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,070
Just like being a seal. Doing, doing
missions is only part of what they,

812
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:32,970
what you need to do to do the mission.
You can't just be tactically sound.

813
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:36,480
You've got to have the relationships
built so you can work in the battlespace

814
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,400
that's owned by a conventional commander.

815
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,070
You got to have the
relationship that you can get.

816
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:43,950
Your mission's approved up the chain of
command on the special operations side.

817
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,420
How do you do that? You build,
you go out, you talk to people,

818
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:52,890
you get out of your comfort zone.
It's a weird thing, you know,

819
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,140
I'm kind of, I'm kind of
antisocial, right? Like

820
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:03,420
if you don't know me,
we're not going to have a conversation.

821
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,270
You know? Like we're not having
a car. Like it's not, I'm not,

822
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,560
I'm not walking up and talking
to you if I don't know you.

823
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,600
I'm not walking up and saying hi to you.
It's not happening.

824
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:17,460
It's not my personality. If
you say hi to me, I'll say hi.

825
00:47:17,461 --> 00:47:19,470
I'm not disrespectful,
I'm not rude,

826
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:24,530
but I'm not looking to have a bunch of
conversations with people and so that's

827
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:25,854
known to me,

828
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:31,510
but that's not okay for the
business side of my life, which is,

829
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,690
hey, I got to talk to people, got
to build relationships. Got It.

830
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:40,030
To had to know my commanding officer had
to know the commodore, had to know the,

831
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:40,900
the,

832
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:44,740
the conventional battalion commander
had to know the brigade commander had to

833
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:45,760
build relationships.

834
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Could I just talk about war
with the brigade commander?

835
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,553
Well I could,

836
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:57,910
but what's more powerful that I talk
about war and I talk about where I'm from

837
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:01,540
or where he's from or what,
you know, other things. Yes.

838
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,190
Cause I want to build a
relationship with a why?

839
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:05,770
Because I'm trying to
build trust. What? Why?

840
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:08,830
Because I want him to allow me to go out
there and do things in his battle space.

841
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,560
So that's what they're asking you.

842
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:14,110
They're asking you to step
out of your comfort zone.

843
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:17,710
It doesn't need to become
your primary focus. No.

844
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,730
Should you try and step out of the
comfort zone if you want to grow,

845
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:24,760
if you want to have more opportunity,
I would give it a try.

846
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,020
I would give it a try. If
not, you know, like I said,

847
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,370
if you hate it and you feel like you're
not being true to your true self,

848
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,940
that's okay.

849
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,900
Maybe your true self is meant to be the
one that's back not getting promoted.

850
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,820
Yeah. They need somebody
to do that. It's not you.

851
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,830
It might be somebody else.
Yeah.

852
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,130
Another one of those tough questions
where people, you know, hit me with like,

853
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,053
should I just be,

854
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,480
shall be loyal to myself because the
obvious answer that everyone wants to hear

855
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:58,090
is like, yeah, dude, two
most important things. You've
got to be loyal to yourself.

856
00:48:58,091 --> 00:49:02,020
That's the most important thing.
Okay. If that's what your priority is,

857
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:05,950
then that's the most important
thing. But guess what? Who Does? Uh,

858
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:10,300
who can take care of the other
kitchen dogs that respect you so much?

859
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,220
Who can take better care of them than
you can? Because if you get promoted,

860
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:16,960
if you don't get promoted and,

861
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:22,230
and Johnny Glamour boy gets
promoted because he likes
to go out and Schmooze the

862
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,720
clients and now he gets
promoted and you're,

863
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,560
and now who's going to take care of the
kitchen dogs on his, on his time, right?

864
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,470
Not Him. He doesn't care. He's got,

865
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:34,750
he got promoted not for
taking care of his guys.

866
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:39,510
He got promoted because he smooths the
clients. Play the game a little bit.

867
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,270
It's weird menu explaining that and
it's like, yeah, makes complete sense.

868
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:48,180
I'm thinking of it in terms
of like being a, I dunno,

869
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,840
I guess it applies to any relationship
you have. So, so like let's say, okay,

870
00:49:51,841 --> 00:49:54,300
you have a wife, right? You're,
you're buried, whatever.

871
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,130
And so your wife wants to go to,

872
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:04,020
hypothetically wife wants to
go to, I dunno, Vermont, right?

873
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:07,080
And you're like, hey, I
don't like Vermont, you know,
go to Vermont to whatever.

874
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,250
But your wife say,
Hey,

875
00:50:08,251 --> 00:50:13,200
I want you to come because I like spending
time with you and in all this stuff.

876
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:15,800
And as a husband, like, hey, I
like spending time with Youtube,

877
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:20,100
why can't we do something that I
specifically like to do whatever.

878
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,410
And it has to do so a lot of times with
like maybe your wife's friends or the

879
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,320
enlarged. So I don't want to
hang with the only hang you,

880
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:28,270
but I want to hang with them.

881
00:50:28,271 --> 00:50:30,260
And the went from to hang with you
with the friends and all this stuff or

882
00:50:30,261 --> 00:50:33,860
whatever. But a lot of the time, my case,

883
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:38,060
it might've been me just sticking
in my little comfort zone, you know,

884
00:50:38,061 --> 00:50:40,250
like the people that I like
to hang out with there,

885
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:43,580
there's like set stuff that I know
they're into and I know that they like to

886
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,170
talk about it and all this stuff.

887
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:50,470
And I'm essentially rejecting
being open to new or other stuff.

888
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,750
You know, that's, you know, this kind
of like a situation. But in a way,

889
00:50:56,751 --> 00:50:59,900
I'm kind of doing what this,
what this guy is implying,

890
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,220
where it's like I'm gonna say true to
myself and my interest in all this stuff.

891
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,890
I love my wife hundred percent
that has nothing to do with it.

892
00:51:06,891 --> 00:51:09,950
Vermont has nothing to do with
me and my wife, you know, but

893
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:15,440
why shouldn't I step outside of
my comfort zone and you know,

894
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:18,260
tried to accommodate
her wishes in this way.

895
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:21,620
It's not a make or break a relationship
or nothing like that. But if I do that,

896
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,970
if I just exercise the ability to be open,

897
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:29,420
I become more valuable of a husband,
more valuable.

898
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:32,720
I offer more value in the
relationship and as a person.

899
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,510
So same exact thing when
you're explaining this,

900
00:51:35,511 --> 00:51:40,370
when this guy's explaining where he's
awesome as a chef in the back doing the,

901
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:45,260
you know, doing his deal, doing what
he does best, awesome. But they,

902
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:48,440
and these guys see it, his severe, see
it obviously, where they're like, hey,

903
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,920
we want you to do this more stuff.
Even cause you're awesome in men.

904
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:54,080
Imagine if you had this,
this more stuff.

905
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,940
You know how valuable
you would be as a Xyz,

906
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,960
whatever the position is in this case
as the ship and to reject that is

907
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:03,700
essentially to say, you know what, I,

908
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:07,940
I don't want to be more valuable as a
chef or I don't want to be more valuable

909
00:52:07,941 --> 00:52:12,710
as a husband.
I prefer to stick with my current value.

910
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,560
I don't want to upgrade.
There you go.

911
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,670
I refuse to upgrade some
staying true to myself.

912
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,510
Just saying anyway.
I mean,

913
00:52:23,511 --> 00:52:27,260
can you cross the line and get to a
point where you make yourself sick cause

914
00:52:27,261 --> 00:52:30,500
you've done. Yeah. Then you've gone too
far. That's the dichotomy of leadership.

915
00:52:30,501 --> 00:52:33,290
Like, yeah, if you become just a

916
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,460
disgusting Sycophant, then guess
what? That's not good. Yeah,

917
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:41,330
so I'm not talking about that.
Yeah.

918
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,870
Well not talking about leaving your
values and abandoning your values,

919
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,160
that's not what I'm talking about.

920
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:48,830
I'm talking about playing the game a
little bit. There's a big difference.

921
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:53,540
Step outside of the comfort zone. Play
the game a little bit. At the very least,

922
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:56,510
do it with an open mind. See how
you like it. What if you were like,

923
00:52:56,511 --> 00:53:00,260
you got real good at that. You know
how like public speaking for example,

924
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,510
where I'm no exception,

925
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,620
a lot of people didn't like
public speaking even though
they might have a lot to

926
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:08,930
say or whatever. You know like
some people like their their spot,

927
00:53:08,931 --> 00:53:11,630
but to I don't want to get up on stage
and nothing like that. That's dumb.

928
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,380
I'm going to, I'm not a star, I don't want
the limelight on me and all this stuff.

929
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,450
Then they do it one time and they,

930
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:21,160
and they offer like just so much value
doing it and then they get used to it and

931
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:23,240
then all of a sudden they stay
kind of like it. You know?

932
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:26,010
It could be one of those
deals. Could, could be.

933
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,320
You never know until you try it.

934
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,303
Next question.

935
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:35,100
Two of my bosses have told me,
I don't like Jocko.

936
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,210
Interesting,
interesting concept.

937
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,280
Without giving any value, valid
reasons. Their ego is in the way.

938
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:47,060
How do I flank them to
help them see the path?

939
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,230
My belief is that they're
afraid of the truth and they,

940
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,320
they're afraid of the truth. They see in
extreme ownership. Okay. So, uh, yeah,

941
00:53:57,321 --> 00:53:59,810
I mean, clearly ego could be a
problem here as a leader, you know,

942
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:04,520
who wants to constantly be compared
to some other leader, right?

943
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:06,880
You know, if you were teaching to
Jujitsu class tickets, like, Whoa,

944
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,870
the way that you, the way that
Dean teaches this, you know,

945
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:13,280
that that would make you mad afterwards.
So that could be part of the problem. Oh,

946
00:54:13,281 --> 00:54:14,810
that's dead.
That's definitely,

947
00:54:14,811 --> 00:54:18,800
that's way up there on the
list of possible things.
Could be the military flavor,

948
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:22,730
right? Some people don't like the military
flavor of thing, so that's, that's okay.

949
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:24,133
It's,

950
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,353
it's

951
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:29,370
can turn some people off. They don't
want to hear about it. That's fine. Uh,

952
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,470
the reality is he,
here's,

953
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,870
but here's the reality of the situation.
Okay.

954
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:41,370
What is there to not like about
the things that I talk about?

955
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,720
Right? So let's say, you know what,
I don't like people taking ownership.

956
00:54:46,721 --> 00:54:49,450
I want everyone to make excuses and
blame each other, right? It doesn't,

957
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,230
it doesn't even make sense.
You know, instead of we,

958
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:54,160
I don't want to hear
about this cover move.

959
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:57,280
I want everyone to ignore each other
and get worry about themselves. Right.

960
00:54:57,281 --> 00:55:01,000
Like that, that makes no
sense whatsoever. You know,

961
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:03,490
if keeping things simple,
I don't want it, hey look,

962
00:55:03,491 --> 00:55:06,070
I don't want to keep things simple.
I want everything to be so complicated,

963
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:09,610
but no one knows what's going on. Right?
Like these things that they make. No,

964
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,170
there's no human being,

965
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:16,330
no one in a leadership position that
would want everyone or that would,

966
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,950
that would go against what
these simple principles. So

967
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,430
how do you fix it then? Right. What's
the problem? Uh, one, here's a couple of,

968
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:32,190
and actually this was a Twitter thing and
a bunch of people gave great responses

969
00:55:32,191 --> 00:55:36,360
on Twitter after I kind of
highlighted it. Uh, one,

970
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:39,900
one of them and my, my actual responses
like, hey, just don't, you know,

971
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,500
stop using my name. You know, stop
saying, well [inaudible] was it?

972
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:46,290
Cause you can't even imagine how annoying
that must be. Right? Well, Jack was in,

973
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,730
you know, when you're in a
leadership position, you know,

974
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:51,300
it's like that's going to really
great on somebody. So, so,

975
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,260
so throw that out the window.
Don't pit it as me,

976
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,490
Jocko against what your bosses
are saying. No, don't do that.

977
00:55:59,491 --> 00:56:02,370
You've set up an adversarial relationship
with them and you've set up or an

978
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:04,440
advert adversary relationship with me.

979
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,320
And I've never even met these people
before. I don't even know who they are,

980
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:08,520
even know what business they're in.

981
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:12,990
But what you've done by constantly harping
on it as you've pissed them off and

982
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:15,600
now they're saying, dude, quit
talking about Daca. We don't care.

983
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,610
Because also the way that he's in
just the way he's being offensive in

984
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:23,860
approaching these things means that he
has a little more listening and growing

985
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:28,300
to do. Because if you really want
to approach your boss or you know,

986
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:31,180
he asked about flanking as possible, the
way you find someone isn't going, hey,

987
00:56:31,181 --> 00:56:34,540
the wedge Alcoa's says you should
do this. Like, no, that's not good.

988
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,420
So let the principals work in another,
another person pointed out, you know,

989
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:42,700
um, hey, don't, hey,

990
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:46,240
stop trying to impose your things on them.

991
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,440
Like take extreme ownership. How's that
sound? You step up and start leading.

992
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,170
You do your thing, you
perform well. Quit talking.

993
00:56:53,171 --> 00:56:56,470
Quit trying to force these things down
people's throats and give them space.

994
00:56:56,471 --> 00:57:01,471
Give them room and then they'll
recognize that you're doing a good job.

995
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,700
If you label it with something
that you know they don't like,

996
00:57:06,701 --> 00:57:08,800
well then they're going not going
to like it. No matter what you do,

997
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:12,550
no matter what you do,
that's going to be problematic.

998
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:17,620
Don't bludgeon them with with will. You
know I've, this is blah, blah, blah. No,

999
00:57:17,621 --> 00:57:21,850
don't do that. Take Let.
Bring your ego in check.

1000
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:24,340
How's that sound for your
ego in check a little bit.

1001
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,270
Make the ideas that you're
talking about their ideas.

1002
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,790
Get them to talk about
ownership, you know, get them.

1003
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:34,450
Maybe they call it something else
other than extreme ownership.

1004
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:39,220
Maybe they call it, you know,
a personal accountability.
Okay, awesome. That's great.

1005
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:41,710
Yeah, I really liked that. I really
like what you've come up with, boss.

1006
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:42,340
I'm in with.

1007
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,450
Oh well now they're in the game and they
don't realize that you're talking about

1008
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:49,780
the same thing. That's fine. Don't
they? Don't ever have to realize that.

1009
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:51,280
They don't ever have to realize that.

1010
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:55,670
So I mean there's some people are
some people that don't like it.

1011
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,380
Even to the teams. There's people that
like, they didn't like me, didn't matter.

1012
00:57:59,381 --> 00:58:03,610
It didn't matter where, what the
principal was, didn't make no, that's,

1013
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:08,880
it's like no, like, hey,
just, just, just don't,

1014
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,510
don't attach my name to it and go
and do be a good leader. How's that?

1015
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:18,880
So those are some things I think
if you live, live the principles,

1016
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,470
act on the principles.

1017
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,130
No one's going to be mad at you for taking
ownership and responsibility of what

1018
00:58:24,131 --> 00:58:27,340
you're doing. Unless you say, Ooh,
you look how I took ownership of that.

1019
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,970
Well then you might paint yourself
into a corner where they ain't stupid,

1020
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,970
where they end up not
accepting what you're doing.

1021
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,270
And they'll get mad at you for
stepping on their toes out of court.

1022
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:41,500
And it is also as you do this, as you take
ownership, don't rub their noses in it.

1023
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:45,280
You give them credit. How
hard is that? You know,

1024
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,500
you've come up with a solution
to a problem. Say, Hey, no,

1025
00:58:47,501 --> 00:58:51,460
actually I got this idea from something
I saw you doing really. Right.

1026
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:55,780
That's how you, that's how you flank them.
Hey, I took ownership of this problem.

1027
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:58,900
Who? Oh, really? Oh, you just go, oh, here
we go. Extreme or, no, don't say that.

1028
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:02,380
Don't say that. You know?
It's like, Hey boss,

1029
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,860
I wanted to make sure this got done
correctly. I was watching the way you did,

1030
00:59:05,861 --> 00:59:10,330
blah, blah, blah, blah, and you
go from there. Give them the idea.

1031
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,050
You it makes sense it,
yeah.

1032
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:19,150
I W I wonder how the boss got introduced
to the concept of Jocko for him to

1033
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:22,430
eventually

1034
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,210
hate and not like in this situation
it probably was like, you know,

1035
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:30,440
multiple repetitions of
way. Yeah. Like, yeah.

1036
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:33,950
You and didn't pick up the vibe.
Yeah. Which is like, hey you,

1037
00:59:33,951 --> 00:59:37,100
I'm dealing with someone with a big ego
and they're not going to take well to me

1038
00:59:37,101 --> 00:59:39,860
talking about this other guy's
leadership style, do you,

1039
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,140
you don't want to be compared to some
other leader if you're in a leadership

1040
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:46,820
position. Yeah man also is kind of the
same thing but a little bit different.

1041
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,920
The, that thinking about
that type of scenario, men,

1042
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:54,410
that's the worst.
That's like as a boss,

1043
00:59:54,411 --> 00:59:58,430
I would think that that'd be
really bad cause, okay, so
here, here's the situation.

1044
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,520
So I make videos sometimes.
Right.

1045
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,010
And so let's say I am,

1046
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,280
and actually this is an actual thing
that actually happened where, okay,

1047
01:00:07,281 --> 01:00:12,140
so I made this video for this. We'll
see client and kind of take, okay.

1048
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:15,200
You know, they look at it
and it's typical, you know,
they'll have some input,

1049
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,980
maybe some information they want to add
or take or change or whatever. And then,

1050
01:00:18,981 --> 01:00:22,640
um, this guy said, oh yeah,

1051
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:28,040
I'm not sure about this part. I showed
it to my wife and she said, you know, x,

1052
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:32,750
Y, Z and x, y. And I'm thinking,
okay, I get it. Like, okay,

1053
01:00:32,751 --> 01:00:35,450
you showed it to people that I understand,
but I was like, wait, wait, wait.

1054
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:40,010
So this is the video made for
you and your deal kind of thing.

1055
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:43,040
And you went and showed your wife and
then now she has some kind of input.

1056
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:44,870
She's not part of this deal.
You know,

1057
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:49,820
now you're like citing your wife's
critique and like all this stuff and it

1058
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:52,850
doesn't make sense by the way, as far as
what we've discussed and all this stuff.

1059
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:54,890
Right. So the, so the wife is now,

1060
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,780
I kind of have this kind
of disdain for the wife.

1061
01:00:56,781 --> 01:00:59,000
I don't know the way if at all by the way.
So I'm like,

1062
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,200
I'm just not feeling the wife anymore.
Ego got in the way a little bit and it's,

1063
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:06,590
and it's natural is what I'm saying
where it's Kinda like I thought we were

1064
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:09,620
doing this video kind of together and
I'll just do this for you and you give me

1065
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:11,420
the input and when now you
involve your wife in it,

1066
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:12,500
who threw the whole thing off?

1067
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:14,720
Cause she's not even part of
this little thing right now.

1068
01:01:14,721 --> 01:01:16,100
Really hard to put your ego in check.

1069
01:01:16,370 --> 01:01:20,120
It's really hard to put your ego in
check and actually listened to what the

1070
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:23,930
critique points are. It's he, it's
hard for anyone to do that, you know?

1071
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:26,780
And so when it happens,
you have to go, okay,

1072
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:32,780
that's my ego and you need to put it
aside. Yeah. So consider the situation.

1073
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,120
If the guy would have just said,

1074
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,990
don't say I showed it to my wife
and she said this, don't say,

1075
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:43,160
if he would've said, well I was thinking
about this, which is, what do I said?

1076
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,430
You know, in their whatever else
finger about this, what does they,

1077
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:49,490
it woulda got delivered way better.
Way Easier. Same thing with here,

1078
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:53,300
your situation. If someone's saying,
I don't know, let's say for example,

1079
01:01:53,301 --> 01:01:57,650
it's a fireman, there's a farm and
you know the, the bosses saying, Hey,

1080
01:01:57,651 --> 01:01:58,820
we should do this and do that.

1081
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:02,330
And then this guy had just out of the
blue said so well Jocko says is like,

1082
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,230
who the hell is jobs?
I don't remember hiring Jocko who did it,

1083
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,400
who is this guy and what's
he talking about? Cool.

1084
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:12,320
But Jocko has no say in this
department. It's me, it's
you. It's the team. You know,

1085
01:02:12,321 --> 01:02:15,500
the team that we've worked with kind of
thing. And that's kind of the feeling.

1086
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,000
So yeah, man, don't say
Jock, lead chocolate.

1087
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,230
I don't need the credit.
Not all.

1088
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:25,900
Next question Jocko.

1089
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:31,040
Please explain how working harder for
an incompetent superior helps oneself.

1090
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,580
I feel like screw them in
whatever lightning bolt of
luck they were struck by it

1091
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:36,600
again in their position.

1092
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:41,660
Is that kind of like screw them and the
horse they wrote in on kind of thing? No,

1093
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,500
he's saying screw them.
They were there.

1094
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,160
They're in their position as superior
because they got lucky. Yeah, yeah.

1095
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:50,670
I didn't get all that. Yeah. And you know,
here's the answer that I was like, okay,

1096
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:53,970
so what are you gonna do then?
What are you gonna do?

1097
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:57,750
Then you're going to sit around and wait
for your own bolt of lightning of luck

1098
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:02,400
to hit you. Is that what you're
going to do? I don't recommend that.

1099
01:03:02,401 --> 01:03:05,070
Instead,
I recommend that you step up and yes,

1100
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:09,750
you do work harder and you do the
best possible job that you can do.

1101
01:03:09,751 --> 01:03:12,840
And you take some pride in what
you're doing and how you're doing it,

1102
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,500
and you do it better than they could,
not to rub their nose into it,

1103
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:19,380
not to prove that you can do a better,

1104
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,540
but out of professionalism.
That's why you do it. Now,

1105
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:28,620
one outcome that can come from that
is they get credit for your work

1106
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:31,530
and it makes y'all mad.
No,

1107
01:03:31,590 --> 01:03:34,200
that's actually good because if they
get credit for your work, guess what?

1108
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,270
Work's going well,
they're going to get promoted,

1109
01:03:37,150 --> 01:03:37,520
okay.

1110
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:41,840
And they get the recognition.
Okay, that's fine.

1111
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:43,050
Okay,

1112
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:46,590
but, but they know where
the actual credit goes,

1113
01:03:46,591 --> 01:03:48,420
even if they don't give it to you.

1114
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:49,370
Okay?

1115
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,050
Even if they don't give it to you,
they know it.

1116
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:52,310
Even if they're the
type of person you'd go,

1117
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,900
that doesn't even realize
that you're like, Oh wow,

1118
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:58,760
I did all that work and he's
taken all the credit for it.

1119
01:03:58,761 --> 01:04:01,220
They didn't even know that I made this
happen or he doesn't even know that he,

1120
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,880
that I made this happen.
They know. They know.

1121
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:10,160
So as long as you can keep your ego
in check and you can let them have the

1122
01:04:10,161 --> 01:04:14,210
credit, eventually they get
promoted, the team's doing well,

1123
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:17,510
you'll look good, you'll get
promoted. You're life is easy,

1124
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:20,750
you're gaining experience,
you've got a good reputation.

1125
01:04:20,751 --> 01:04:25,660
Like everything is going in your
direction. And, and by the way,

1126
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:27,760
when that incompetent
person does get promoted,

1127
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:30,370
who do they usually recommend
that fills their spot?

1128
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,100
You cause you're the one that got
them promoted. They're stoked on that.

1129
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,660
Now you become a superstar.
That's great.

1130
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,640
Eventually they're going to get found out.
By the way,

1131
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:44,290
like someone in competency can't be hidden
forever and eventually someone says,

1132
01:04:44,291 --> 01:04:46,090
wait a second, you didn't even
know how to do this. That was,

1133
01:04:46,091 --> 01:04:50,560
that was echo Charles that was doing
this this whole time. Yeah. Okay. Okay,

1134
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:53,680
well we're going to promote echo.
You're out of here. That that'll happen.

1135
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:58,120
And when that happens,
we in competency gets found out,

1136
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:01,690
then you will get the recognition
you deserve because people said, oh,

1137
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:05,630
that wasn't Jocko doing all this stuff.
This was echo. They go, oh Jocko,

1138
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,440
you're done. So that, so
that's something had happened.

1139
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:12,710
Or another outcome that can happen is
that they give you the credit that that

1140
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:13,540
you're do,

1141
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:17,110
which is great and you still get
promoted and you may get promoted above,

1142
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:21,370
which is fine too. Oh and or they
might get promoted, which is fine.

1143
01:05:21,371 --> 01:05:25,430
Stop worrying about it.
So those two things,

1144
01:05:25,431 --> 01:05:28,730
if you do a good job, eventually
something good is going to come out of it.

1145
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:31,220
Whether it's they get,
whether it's you both get promoted,

1146
01:05:31,221 --> 01:05:32,450
whether it's they get promoted above you,

1147
01:05:32,451 --> 01:05:35,330
whether it's you get promoted above that,
it doesn't matter all those outcomes.

1148
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:38,780
Or maybe it's just the team continues to
do well and your job is stress free and

1149
01:05:38,781 --> 01:05:41,700
you continue to perform.
And, and the, the, the,

1150
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:45,200
the division that you're in grows and
you get a chance to promote because

1151
01:05:45,201 --> 01:05:47,840
everyone's getting promoted. It's
like all good, all good stuff.

1152
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:50,810
Or you can be angry.

1153
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,540
And you can be frustrated and you can
blame your own bad luck and you can not

1154
01:05:53,541 --> 01:05:56,840
work hard and you can not do a good job
and you can be recognized as a slacker

1155
01:05:56,841 --> 01:06:01,100
and you can get blamed by the incompetent
competent boss when things do fall

1156
01:06:01,101 --> 01:06:04,970
short, because that's what the incompetent
boss does. He doesn't step up and say,

1157
01:06:04,971 --> 01:06:07,520
go ownership of it. He says, no, you
know what? I would've done a better job,

1158
01:06:07,521 --> 01:06:10,790
but echo was slacking. That's
the problem. Now Aco gets fired.

1159
01:06:12,330 --> 01:06:12,900
Okay.

1160
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,260
And,
and guess what?

1161
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:16,930
Someone we hire someone else to come
in and they start doing a good job.

1162
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,510
That boss still going to look good.
I still get promoted.

1163
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,490
Just that you lost your
job and by the way,

1164
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:22,900
you lost her job with a bad reputation.

1165
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:24,880
Now you can't even get a
recommendation for a new job.

1166
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,840
So you lose. That's what's
going to happen. Yeah.

1167
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:35,810
So step up, do your best.
It'll pay off in the long run.

1168
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,620
Yeah. It's funny how like
it's one of those things
where if you can just flip the

1169
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:42,650
switch and see that. Just that one
little thing, and it's funny though too,

1170
01:06:42,651 --> 01:06:45,500
the way.
That's the way these questions are framed.

1171
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:49,100
You know what they want to hear
is like, no, you know what?

1172
01:06:49,101 --> 01:06:52,540
If you've got an incompetent
boss, you don't help him
out. You Bet I'm Berg. Yeah,

1173
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:55,470
that's what you do. That's what
people want to hear. But it's,

1174
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:59,330
it's the easy answer and it's not the
smart answer and it's a short term answer,

1175
01:06:59,331 --> 01:07:04,220
not a long term answer. You make your boss
look great. How's that? That's my goal.

1176
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,830
I want to make my boss look great.
You know there,

1177
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,450
there was a little tell in the,
in the question too,

1178
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:15,320
I'm no expert obviously, but
lightning bolt of lock La. Yeah.

1179
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:18,140
So you know the whole deal, and this
is even, you can be an normal person.

1180
01:07:18,141 --> 01:07:20,840
They recognize this like
people who are bitter.

1181
01:07:20,841 --> 01:07:24,380
I'm not saying the asker of this
question has been, I'm not saying that,

1182
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:27,380
I'm saying this is the external scenario,

1183
01:07:27,381 --> 01:07:31,070
but you know how if you get a bitter
person who's just been in life,

1184
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:35,030
maybe not doing as well in life
as they had hoped or whatever,

1185
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:39,830
you'll probability wise you'll probably
encounter them from time to time.

1186
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:45,260
No more saying how the guy
who is successful is lucky.

1187
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,910
They're lucky, big headache given to
them like all this, all this other stuff.

1188
01:07:49,911 --> 01:07:54,080
Me, I'm not lucky with whatever, but
it's always the sixth successful guys.

1189
01:07:54,081 --> 01:07:55,330
Lucky always.
Yeah.

1190
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,460
They attribute other people's
success to luck to look for sure.

1191
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:02,930
So the lightning bolt
of luck in screw them,

1192
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,900
you know kind of thing. Just that
is indicative. I'm not saying it is,

1193
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:08,510
I'm not saying it is or isn't as
far as this particular person,

1194
01:08:08,511 --> 01:08:11,570
but it tends to be like
that. And again, like that,

1195
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:14,300
just that switch if you can like turn
on the switch and just look at it.

1196
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,980
Just how you said, yeah, it's not

1197
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,180
intuitive.
I get it man.

1198
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:22,010
Because it's like I was in that situation
where like literally I was doing the

1199
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:22,180
work.

1200
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:25,020
So think about this.
You just said you're in this situation.

1201
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,730
Almost everybody has been in this
situation and here's the difference.

1202
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,480
If you don't flip that switch
and you're in this situation,

1203
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:37,530
your whole wife goes down in the other
direction. Yeah, that's a real problem.

1204
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:41,080
That's why you meet people. You know, this
is a a thing I think about a lot. You,

1205
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:45,960
you don't know you, you know people in
your life, they're bad asses, but they,

1206
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:50,130
but they're not going anywhere. Like,
like you look at it and you go, man,

1207
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:52,830
this guy is smarter than me and,

1208
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:56,820
and by better athlete than me
and a better speaker than me,

1209
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,880
but they're not going anywhere.
And you know why?

1210
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:03,870
It's because at some point in their life,
instead of saying, Oh wow, that guy's,

1211
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:08,130
that guy's lucky. That's what they do at
some point their life instead of saying,

1212
01:09:08,131 --> 01:09:12,390
hey, that person worked to get in that
situation and I should do the same.

1213
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:15,330
Instead of saying that, they
say, oh, that person got lucky.

1214
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:19,540
That's why they're there.
And I'm down here. Yeah.

1215
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,740
You can't make the upward climb if
you don't say, you know what? Hey,

1216
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,710
that person might be a little luck there.
But guess what?

1217
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,270
They're obviously working hard.

1218
01:09:27,271 --> 01:09:29,550
They're obviously doing something right
because I'm down here and there up there.

1219
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,470
How do I get up there?
Yeah.

1220
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:35,160
The answer to get up there
as not by tearing them down.

1221
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:38,370
The answer to get up there is
by working hard. Yeah. Make them

1222
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:43,320
good that the line you said,
um,

1223
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:46,440
what, and so what are you
going to do about it? And yeah,

1224
01:09:46,441 --> 01:09:48,560
what are they going to do?
But that's the switch right there.

1225
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,220
Cause I mean you deal with it with kids
obviously they have some young kids and

1226
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:56,990
you know, same thing like oh this is how
it is or this happened or, or whatever,

1227
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,440
spilt milk out and whatever.
And you know, the kid's crying.

1228
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:03,770
It's all this stuff's like, okay, so
what are you going to do about it?

1229
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,920
So you can cry.
You totally can.

1230
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:11,210
And you can complain about how junk that
is that the mill that spill to your toy

1231
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:14,030
broke or whatever the situation.
Yeah, cause that's all true.

1232
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:16,730
It's absolutely true and
good. You can cry, whatever,

1233
01:10:16,731 --> 01:10:18,620
but if that's what you're going
to do about it, then okay,

1234
01:10:18,621 --> 01:10:20,810
then that's what it's going to be
and that's all it's going to be.

1235
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:23,690
You're going to continue to cry and
you'll probably continue to cry next time.

1236
01:10:23,691 --> 01:10:28,340
It happens too. Or you clean up the milk,
you fix your toy, whatever, you know,

1237
01:10:28,341 --> 01:10:30,680
whatever. What are you going to do about
it? That's the whole thing. You know?

1238
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,470
What are you gonna do about it? It's
interesting too. There's like a,

1239
01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:35,590
just a known,

1240
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:40,470
the right answer seems really obvious
when we talk about it right now,

1241
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:43,060
but not many people see that right answer.
No.

1242
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:46,830
Most people want to just be mad at their
boss and be frustrated and undermine

1243
01:10:46,831 --> 01:10:50,820
them and not work hard so that they don't
get any shine on them. It's like, okay,

1244
01:10:50,821 --> 01:10:54,180
great. That's you putting yourself
in that barrel to, yeah, don't do it.

1245
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:58,690
It's crazy, man. Actually, I
shouldn't say it's crazy. It's,

1246
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:03,700
it makes sense. I mean, I
felt that before 100% yeah.

1247
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:07,390
Oh for sure. For sure. Next question.

1248
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,180
Can you be default aggressive
and relaxed in Jujitsu?

1249
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:15,961
Okay.
Yeah.

1250
01:11:15,961 --> 01:11:18,930
This seems like two opposing things
that you can't do at the same time,

1251
01:11:18,931 --> 01:11:21,780
but the actual fact is yes,
you can and you should.

1252
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,020
So you want your maneuvers
to be aggressive,

1253
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:28,950
but you don't want to be using a bunch
of strength to execute the maneuvers,

1254
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,251
right?

1255
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:34,251
You want to aggressively escape your
opponent's position before your opponent

1256
01:11:35,881 --> 01:11:40,380
gets settled. Therefore, you don't have
to use strength. You can use relax it.

1257
01:11:40,381 --> 01:11:42,720
You can relax, you can,
you can be proactive.

1258
01:11:42,721 --> 01:11:45,900
Same thing with defending
a a submission attempt.

1259
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:50,620
You want to sub defend that submission
attempt aggressively before the

1260
01:11:50,621 --> 01:11:53,100
submission attempt gets settled in.

1261
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:58,050
You want to move aggressively.
Again,

1262
01:11:58,051 --> 01:12:00,030
I'm not talking about
strength and spasming,

1263
01:12:00,031 --> 01:12:05,031
I'm talking about moving aggressively
before your opponent moves and get ahead

1264
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:08,070
of them on their Ooda loop. When you
get ahead of them on their Ooda loop,

1265
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:13,170
they're going to have issues
with you and so yeah, absolutely.

1266
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:16,380
You can be default aggressive and at
the same time you can be relaxed and you

1267
01:12:16,381 --> 01:12:17,790
should.
That should be your goal.

1268
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:23,100
Do you sometimes have to use strength
in Jujitsu? Yes you do. Yes you do.

1269
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:26,170
Sometimes you got a power out
or something. Why did you,

1270
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,990
the reason you had to
power out of something,

1271
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:31,140
it's because you were too late because
you weren't moving aggressively enough.

1272
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,010
You want to move in quickly enough
and so then you've got to power out of

1273
01:12:35,011 --> 01:12:38,670
something kind. Call those hands,
claw that guillotine off your neck.

1274
01:12:38,671 --> 01:12:40,770
Do you know what I'm saying? You want
to get a gauge on what some of them,

1275
01:12:40,771 --> 01:12:45,390
they're clawing your fingers
away from their neck. Yes.
Yeah. So when that happens,

1276
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:50,190
that person was late and and now they're
clawing. They're resorting to strength.

1277
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:54,450
There were resorting to panic, clawing
at your fingers. Sometimes it doesn't.

1278
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:57,910
It usually doesn't even matter. They
can claw. It doesn't matter. You good?

1279
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:03,060
I like that sense of panic that I
feel when they're clawing. Yeah,

1280
01:13:03,061 --> 01:13:07,740
I'm sure you do. You really like it a
lot. So that's what, that's what it is.

1281
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:12,180
And by the way, this is true in
life as well, right? Like if,

1282
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,160
if you are maneuvering correctly,
correctly as a leader,

1283
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,470
you don't have to get aggressive at
people because they're doing what they're

1284
01:13:22,471 --> 01:13:26,160
supposed to be doing. You don't have
to be, you shouldn't have to yell.

1285
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:29,970
If you have to yell as a boss, guess
what? Your, your intent wasn't followed.

1286
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,610
Your plan wasn't understood.
There's so many mistakes that you made.

1287
01:13:32,611 --> 01:13:35,500
If you're yelling as a leader,
do you never have the oh yeah.

1288
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:37,320
So sometimes you can yell cause you've
got gotta make sure you can get that

1289
01:13:37,321 --> 01:13:38,160
emotional point across.

1290
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,530
Sometimes you've got to make sure that
someone really like someone doesn't seem

1291
01:13:40,531 --> 01:13:43,140
to realize that the mistake that they
made is severe enough that it warrants a

1292
01:13:43,141 --> 01:13:45,780
yelling and therefore it doesn't matter
to them because their dad yelled at them

1293
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:49,290
their whole life. What? So
if you're not yelling, they
don't get it. So can you can,

1294
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:53,340
can you run into that cake
problem? Occasionally,
occasionally. Very occasionally.

1295
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:53,821
Very.

1296
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:57,900
Very rarely should you run
into that situation because
if you're doing the right

1297
01:13:57,901 --> 01:14:00,180
job,
being default aggressive as a leader,

1298
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:05,220
you should be in situations where you
never have to yell because your people,

1299
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,600
because your people understand what it
is that they're supposed to be doing.

1300
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:13,000
They understand why they're to be doing
it. They understand what the plan is,

1301
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:15,640
they understand what the contingencies
ward, they understand what the,

1302
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,820
what the intent that you had was.

1303
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:22,180
They understand this way that this
fits strategically into the situation.

1304
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,850
They understand all those things and
if they understand all those things,

1305
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,190
then they're going to do the right thing.
And if they don't,

1306
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:30,310
if they understand all those things
and they still do something that that

1307
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,330
doesn't make sense, we'll meet. Maybe
they do deserve, get yelled at. But again,

1308
01:14:34,331 --> 01:14:37,310
all the first person that I
check is myself and say, well,

1309
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:38,530
I obviously I to make this clear enough.

1310
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:42,280
Hmm. So yes, relax harder.

1311
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:49,290
So yelling is to leading as using
strength is to Jujitsu somewhat.

1312
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:54,220
You got to do it every once in a while.
Every once in a while. Or if you lay,

1313
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,300
maybe you lacked on your
technique earlier, you got
to kind of make up a little,

1314
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:03,990
but think about this, you hurt
your stamina. Strength. Right.

1315
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:08,590
And when I yell at you because something
went wrong and you're my subordinate

1316
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,350
when I yell at you,
I pay a little price for that too.

1317
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:16,090
Cause I better be important and I better
really think about it cause I didn't do

1318
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:19,790
anything to build our relationship in a
positive manner by yelling at you. Right.

1319
01:15:19,870 --> 01:15:20,703
Didn't do anything.

1320
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:21,563
Yeah.

1321
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:25,890
Just like you didn't improve your
Jujitsu technique or knowledge in east or

1322
01:15:25,891 --> 01:15:29,190
really you, I guess you improved
your situation for a moment. Right?

1323
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:30,690
Cause you escaped,
but now you're more tired.

1324
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,680
Just like if I yelled at you to do
something and you did it cause you real,

1325
01:15:34,681 --> 01:15:36,060
you know, you were like, okay, well fine.

1326
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:38,670
I want to get yelled at anymore so I'm
just gonna do this thing that he told me

1327
01:15:38,671 --> 01:15:42,600
to do that it's temporary.
The temporary fix.

1328
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:46,890
It's a temporary fix. Yeah. You
know how like JP will say, um,

1329
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:50,790
aggressive, it isn't, or do you felt
aggressive isn't towards people.

1330
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:54,330
It's towards making things happen. So
like so when do you do it? The same thing.

1331
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:59,010
So it's like I don't aggressively like
it's and it in a way you kind of can

1332
01:15:59,011 --> 01:16:00,540
narrow it down to the timing thing.

1333
01:16:00,570 --> 01:16:03,960
It's like it's like it's either taking
action or hesitating kind of thing.

1334
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,400
So you just don't really hesitate.

1335
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,160
You can lay back if that's part of
the strategy and stuff like that.

1336
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,020
You can relax when it's
part of the strategy,

1337
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:11,280
but it's about making things happen.

1338
01:16:11,281 --> 01:16:13,050
Like what are you trying to
make things happen timing wise.

1339
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:17,790
So you know how like you have to think.
Tim Ferriss asked what is the disrespect?

1340
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:22,210
Remember he asked me that, what's the
disrespect? Oh it's a Jujitsu move.

1341
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:26,940
I'll go past your do that you made,
but you made up the terminology as well.

1342
01:16:27,330 --> 01:16:31,650
So the disrespect is basically when a
guy pulls guard or you're in a guard

1343
01:16:31,651 --> 01:16:34,680
scenario, it's actually not
even the guard scenario yet.

1344
01:16:35,370 --> 01:16:39,510
It's like you essentially treat that
person like they don't even have a guard.

1345
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:43,090
The guard doesn't even exist. That's how
little respect you have for the garden.

1346
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:45,300
And then you just pass.
But when you kind of think about it,

1347
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,640
when I think about it,
when you've done it to me,

1348
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:50,820
the times you have it is literally that.

1349
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,690
So before I can establish any kind
of position to establish guard,

1350
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,640
you're just just, yeah, you're a
pass it, you're done. You know,

1351
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:00,760
you don't even consider the guard.
You know what's weird is,

1352
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:04,140
is where people get confused on
this though, is they think, Oh sir,

1353
01:17:04,141 --> 01:17:08,370
you're saying move faster. Yeah,
right. That's the weird thing. It is.

1354
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:12,860
It's not. It's a, I'm sure I'll
think of this at a later time,

1355
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:18,200
but it's not about moving faster.
It's moving more aggressively.

1356
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:19,430
Right?
It's not faster.

1357
01:17:19,431 --> 01:17:23,810
It's like being proactive and being
aggressive and shutting down the situation

1358
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:24,440
before it,

1359
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,840
before it even becomes the situation that
you'd know what's going to become. Yup.

1360
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,700
So if you take, like you said, like,

1361
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:33,080
like if you take a taking action
and hesitation, you take those two.

1362
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:36,770
It's basically you're narrowing the
hesitation down to zero, if possible.

1363
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:41,900
Literally what it is. Yeah, just take
action. And again, you can relax,

1364
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:45,140
you can wait, but it's not
hesitation waiting. It's waiting.

1365
01:17:45,141 --> 01:17:48,560
It's like one more like being patient
or waiting for a very specific reason.

1366
01:17:48,561 --> 01:17:51,170
You can do all those things,
but there's no hesitation.

1367
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,910
That's what I think that is.

1368
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:57,560
And then obviously it's going to vary
from case to hear over and over and over

1369
01:17:57,561 --> 01:18:02,561
again in combat leadership philosophies
like doing something now is better than

1370
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:04,940
waiting, doing, doing something,

1371
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,510
doing something that's pretty good right
now is infinitely better than doing

1372
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:12,780
something that's great in two days.
Yeah. Good plan. No better than a great,

1373
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:17,270
really aggressive. Make something
happen like that is so important.

1374
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,580
Can you overdo it?
Yes you can.

1375
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,010
Can you make stupid decisions
because you rushed it. Yes you can.

1376
01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:26,000
Is there a dichotomy in this?
Absolutely. There is due. That's,

1377
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:29,570
there's a dichotomy and every part of
it, so, and every type of leadership.

1378
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:31,310
There's a dichotomy in Jujitsu,
right?

1379
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:34,880
There's a doctor because if
I just rushed to a situation,

1380
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:37,280
well that might be the situation
that you want to be to rush to.

1381
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:41,930
You gave me the opening, the trap,
the trap. So it's like, you know,

1382
01:18:41,931 --> 01:18:44,960
when you're helping your friend
move and then you get like three,

1383
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:49,790
four other friends, you
know, and everyone's waiting
around to be like, okay,

1384
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,790
where do we start? Okay, where do
we put, you know, where do we start?

1385
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:55,820
Who starting first kind of thing.
The default aggressive guy.

1386
01:18:55,821 --> 01:18:59,270
He's just going to start moving
stuff. And that seemed like, okay,

1387
01:18:59,271 --> 01:19:01,580
that's like a little lighthearted
scenario, but by that's real.

1388
01:19:01,581 --> 01:19:03,230
That's when I would run into it.
You don't want to,

1389
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:06,530
there's a bunch of people and we're
all capable of making the decision.

1390
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:09,440
It kind of paralyzes everyone
because this is so true.

1391
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,600
That scenario that you're talking about,

1392
01:19:11,670 --> 01:19:13,820
it happens over and over and
over again in the business world.

1393
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:15,570
It happens over and over
again on the battlefield.

1394
01:19:15,571 --> 01:19:19,270
What happens on the training field
where there's a bunch of people,

1395
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,160
no one's taking leadership positions.
Yeah.

1396
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:24,970
Like you're all it takes is
someone to say, Hey, we're
moving this over here. Yeah.

1397
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,250
They put all this to get all this
stuff off the truck right now. Boom.

1398
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,930
All right guys. We're like, okay,
cool. Well we'll make it happen. Yeah.

1399
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:34,070
Like you're a oil rig scenario.
The main exact same thing. Yeah.

1400
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:39,280
And if your default aggressive
meaning that's your default,

1401
01:19:40,011 --> 01:19:43,160
that's the, that's your zero,
you'd hear that hundred percent.

1402
01:19:43,460 --> 01:19:48,460
Then you're just handling business your
whole life till you take it too far and

1403
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:51,620
you're trying to run stuff that other
people might have a better vision of what

1404
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:54,110
to do. Like if I might be, I,

1405
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:59,030
if I'm only moving for the first time
ever on our moving team and I come in,

1406
01:19:59,031 --> 01:19:59,864
I'm like hey guess what?

1407
01:19:59,870 --> 01:20:01,940
Hey we're going to start getting this
the heavy stuff and you're like hey

1408
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:04,850
actually that's not a good idea.
Yeah we should do this.

1409
01:20:04,851 --> 01:20:08,010
We should get this stuff
in here, the truck first or
whatever. Right. Cause you've

1410
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,550
been doing it longer so even though
it's got to be your default mode again,

1411
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,610
there's a dichotomy you can push it too
far. Yeah. Got to keep your eyes open.

1412
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:19,170
That's the question.
Let's do one more Jocko.

1413
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,040
How do self awareness,

1414
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:28,370
self assessment and self improvement
begin and how do they continue over time?

1415
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,933
Well,

1416
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:38,180
they're all tied together and
it starts with being self aware,

1417
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:45,790
with being able to detach.
Because if you,

1418
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:48,420
if you cannot detach from yourself

1419
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,750
then you can't see yourself.

1420
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:53,290
Yeah.

1421
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:58,260
And so people ask,
how do you detach from yourself?

1422
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:03,270
How do you learn to do that in a good
drill for this is try to imagine the way

1423
01:21:04,391 --> 01:21:09,391
other people see you and what
other people are thinking of you

1424
01:21:12,060 --> 01:21:15,180
in one place where this happens,

1425
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:18,930
and it definitely happened to me is
when I started getting put in charge of

1426
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:22,380
things, I started thinking about
other people's perspectives.

1427
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:24,600
What are they seeing?

1428
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,150
Yeah.

1429
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,980
If you're in charge,

1430
01:21:27,981 --> 01:21:32,870
then what are your subordinates see you
do? What are your subordinates here?

1431
01:21:32,871 --> 01:21:33,704
You say,

1432
01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:38,710
what kind of representation
are they receiving?

1433
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:45,980
And if you work for someone else,
it's the same questions.

1434
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:50,810
What does the boss see me do?
What does the boss here me say?

1435
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:55,490
What kind of representation
am I making of myself?

1436
01:21:55,491 --> 01:21:56,390
To my boss?

1437
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:03,210
And then you start thinking about what
are your friends and family think?

1438
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:07,080
What do they see?
What do they hear?

1439
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,520
And so the question becomes how
well do you represent yourself?

1440
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:17,290
What shortfalls do you have?

1441
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:20,170
Now when you first start looking,

1442
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,060
it's like you're looking
at an overgrown lawn.

1443
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:30,670
There are some big obvious problems.
So you do a broad,

1444
01:22:30,850 --> 01:22:33,760
just kind of general cut of the grass.

1445
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:38,860
You fix some of the big easy
problems that are obvious.

1446
01:22:40,630 --> 01:22:41,560
Once you've done that,

1447
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,970
once you've gotten rid of some
of those big obvious problems,

1448
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:50,680
you notice some more detailed
problems. See? Then you handle them.

1449
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,430
And once you've got those handled, you
see even smaller and more detailed issue.

1450
01:22:55,431 --> 01:22:56,980
So you start trying to fix them.

1451
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:00,253
Okay?

1452
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:03,680
And that's what you do with yourself.

1453
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:08,681
You continually detach and then you look
and then you refine and then you detach

1454
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:13,480
and then you look and then you refine
and then you detach and then you look and

1455
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:16,780
then you refine.
That's what you do.

1456
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:19,820
Yeah.

1457
01:23:19,820 --> 01:23:24,470
That's how you get better.
And that process doesn't stop.

1458
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:28,460
It can't stop because
if you stop refining,

1459
01:23:28,910 --> 01:23:29,750
then

1460
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:32,163
yeah,

1461
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:35,580
then the weeds grow back in.
The next thing you know,

1462
01:23:35,581 --> 01:23:37,830
you can't see yourself anymore

1463
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,670
there when you can't see yourself anymore.

1464
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:46,960
When you stop looking at user yourself,
then you accept,

1465
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:50,950
yeah,
you accept anything

1466
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:54,743
that's wrong.

1467
01:23:57,260 --> 01:24:02,120
Don't accept the faults. Don't give
yourself the benefit of the doubt.

1468
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:05,960
You've got to be your own harshest critic.

1469
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:10,920
It hold the line

1470
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:18,840
and don't let
go.

1471
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,310
Yeah,

1472
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:27,270
and I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

1473
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,740
So
Echo Charles,

1474
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:36,630
speaking of improving ourselves,
sure.

1475
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:41,400
Have any recommendations as to how we
might be able to prove ourselves a little

1476
01:24:41,401 --> 01:24:46,380
bit. Sure. Improve and maintain,
improve, maintain improvement. Well,

1477
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:51,900
something like that I
would recommend. Okay.

1478
01:24:51,901 --> 01:24:53,550
Let's start with the workout,
right?

1479
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:58,170
We're keyed out is established and known,

1480
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:02,820
well known by the way to be one of the
only things that you can do that all

1481
01:25:02,821 --> 01:25:05,160
affect every other part of
your life in a good way.

1482
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,020
It's also one of those things that,
well, more health, if you lose that,

1483
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:10,854
you lose everything.

1484
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:16,010
It's one of those things for why do some
of us not regarded in that way 100% of

1485
01:25:17,911 --> 01:25:22,800
the time? Why is, why do people
not have time to exercise?

1486
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:26,160
Lack of discipline. We, yeah, possibly.

1487
01:25:26,890 --> 01:25:29,210
It might be that short term payoff thing.
You,

1488
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:32,040
it's natural to seek short term path.
It's natural.

1489
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:35,730
I think that's it because again,
you lose your health,

1490
01:25:35,731 --> 01:25:37,410
you lose everything straight up.

1491
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,190
So why wouldn't health be
first on the priority list?

1492
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:44,430
I don't have time to exercise.
No, you have time to exercise.

1493
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:48,930
You might not have time to the
rest of the stuff in life. Really.

1494
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,510
That's how it should
be, right? Nonetheless,

1495
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:56,310
when you're exercising your
joints degenerate, the,

1496
01:25:56,311 --> 01:26:00,270
don't worry about that even because
chocolate supplements, Jocko supplements,

1497
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,890
Jocko,
Super Krill oil.

1498
01:26:01,891 --> 01:26:05,060
This is Omega threes for your joints for
a lot of other stuff too, by the way.

1499
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:09,560
Praying skin, skin tone, that's
like a supplemental thing,

1500
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:12,110
but it is good for it nonetheless.
That's a fact.

1501
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:15,830
And another one called Jocko
joint warfare. So your joints,

1502
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:20,480
when you start to lose the
functionality of your joints,

1503
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:25,400
not only does it make workouts,
less desirable,

1504
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:28,640
less fun, effective, less fun,

1505
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:32,270
less everything it can,

1506
01:26:32,310 --> 01:26:35,240
it can jam up your health physically.
You can be less capable.

1507
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:38,450
So you want to maintain your joints.
I didn't know this, but now that I do,

1508
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:42,320
I'm never looking back. Jocko
Supergirl, take that and joint warfare,

1509
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:46,490
maintain the joints.
Maintain joint health every single day.

1510
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,760
Get the subscription so you don't run out.
That's what I say straight up.

1511
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,850
Like there's a panic mode if you run out.
Yeah,

1512
01:26:52,851 --> 01:26:55,460
and you don't want that panic mode.
You don't even need that panic mode.

1513
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,740
You didn't need that in your life even.
So why even bother?

1514
01:26:57,741 --> 01:27:00,620
So get the subscription. Do the recurring
one every month, every two months,

1515
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:04,520
however often you take them depending,
you know how, how nuts you want to get.

1516
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:07,640
Also,
Jocko has a supplement.

1517
01:27:07,641 --> 01:27:12,470
This is for your brain
and your body all in one.

1518
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:17,570
You don't have to take the pre workout
and the cognitive enhancing a nootropic.

1519
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:18,290
You don't have to do that.

1520
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:21,920
And where you take to just the ones called
discipline tastes good to lemon, lime

1521
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:28,340
forced multiplier, what we call it.
Boom. That's a good way. Take that.

1522
01:27:28,341 --> 01:27:31,010
That'll help you.
That'll take help you to stay on task.

1523
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:35,430
Find all the words that you're looking
for to use, you know, you don't want,

1524
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:39,440
what do you call that anyway? Not Brain
fog. Brain farts. Such a lame word.

1525
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:43,400
Not late. It's not a lame
word. It's a lame word when
I say it. Absent mindedness,

1526
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:46,370
absent mindedness, you know it
kind of combats all that stuff.

1527
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:52,280
Present mindedness is the opposite of
apps technically. Technically. Yeah.

1528
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:55,790
Nonetheless. Promote that and you're
all good. It's called discipline.

1529
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:00,290
Get all these ad or domain.com
the company's origin.

1530
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:03,590
I say origin Maine. I just did. That's
the company. I say its origin Maine,

1531
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,240
but it's really called origin.

1532
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:10,270
It's in Maine and the website is
origin main.com also on origin.

1533
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:14,930
Me, Giza in rash guards for your Jujitsu
journey. Important journey, by the way.

1534
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,310
I would say 90 I would
say every 100% of one,

1535
01:28:19,311 --> 01:28:23,030
not 100% almost a hundred
percent of people who started
Jujitsu, we'll say, okay,

1536
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:24,860
it's valuable whether
they stick with it or not.

1537
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:27,750
You cannot deny the value of Jujitsu.
Even with the,

1538
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:32,180
is that one of the questions earlier?
Boom. You inoculate yourself,

1539
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:33,840
you know all these things and it,

1540
01:28:33,841 --> 01:28:37,940
it's weird how it affects the rest
of your life. Jujitsu's good. Yeah.

1541
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:42,710
For your whole life. Yeah. None the less.
When you start, you could ask what? Gee,

1542
01:28:42,711 --> 01:28:46,790
should I get? Guess what origin you
get an origin g made in America.

1543
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:51,890
The fabric's made in America that cotton
to make the fabric is made in America.

1544
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,090
Grown in America.
See,

1545
01:28:53,091 --> 01:28:57,350
we're going all the way down to
grown you straight up from dirt,

1546
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:01,200
from the dirt to the her shirt to
the guitar top to all that stuff.

1547
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:04,010
They also got hoodies.
Pizza,

1548
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:08,830
me some new sweat suit situation.
Oh,

1549
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,290
joggers got him on right now she's
straight up. Most comfortable.

1550
01:29:14,080 --> 01:29:17,470
What does comfortable clothes,

1551
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,460
this goes for all clothing I've ever had.
Just to Anna,

1552
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:26,040
that saint alive most comfortable and for
a straight up. Is She straight up? Yeah.

1553
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:30,840
How did this happen? Um, is it because
it's made in America? Maybe, maybe not,

1554
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:35,190
but it does speak a lot for the quality
of origin in and of itself. And oh wait,

1555
01:29:35,191 --> 01:29:38,280
it's comfortable because it was made
in America. That's the question. Is it?

1556
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:42,600
Or isn't it? I don't know. But it is
comfortable. 100% the most common,

1557
01:29:42,601 --> 01:29:43,770
most comfortable.
That's,

1558
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:47,190
I know it is because you are
one that deals high and comfort.

1559
01:29:47,191 --> 01:29:48,870
I know my comfort levels.
Yes.

1560
01:29:48,871 --> 01:29:53,250
I mean comfort kind of sore a hundred
percent and this one graded off the charts

1561
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:58,350
check, but he'd lay down, he'd take a
break. So I export stuff, you know, in,

1562
01:29:58,351 --> 01:30:01,560
in, in video editing and special effects,
you get an export. So three d stuff,

1563
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:05,970
export and takes a long time. Three d
studio Max, that's what it's called.

1564
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:11,580
It takes a long time. So while it
exports, you start using your computer,

1565
01:30:11,581 --> 01:30:13,920
doing other things, it kind of,
you know, he can jam, you'll up,

1566
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:16,380
it will slow down your computer, whatever.
So, you know, I'd take a little break.

1567
01:30:16,381 --> 01:30:18,120
I'm gonna lay down on the
couch and called my origin.

1568
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:23,121
Whole sweatsuit on gets off and I lay
down on the couch and I'm like this for

1569
01:30:23,310 --> 01:30:26,030
some, for some reason I'm the most
comfortable I've ever been in my,

1570
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:31,770
I'll talk to Pete. You need
like a, uh, a signature series

1571
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,590
series. Yeah, I have it
on right now. That's it.

1572
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:40,860
You know you've got to do
is rename it, embroidered it
right on the side. Boom. Eq,

1573
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,030
doctrinals cruising and comfort. Oh, big
time day. And here's the thing. Sure.

1574
01:30:45,031 --> 01:30:49,790
I say that and I know comfort is kind
of a subjective thing maybe. Well,

1575
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:54,660
okay, I challenge anyone to, if you have
the origin sweat suit or if you get one,

1576
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:58,950
get on it, lay down on your couch.
Temperature would have to be just right.

1577
01:30:58,951 --> 01:31:01,350
Cause if it's hot and you have a sweat
suit on and not to be as comfortable,

1578
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:05,370
but keep that in mind.
I challenge you to do that report back.

1579
01:31:05,371 --> 01:31:07,980
If it's not the most comfortable
letting me know we're 100%

1580
01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:14,580
you get a taste of real American
made comfort too. By the way, also,

1581
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:20,280
if you're into Jujitsu or if you're not
introduced to those in Jujitsu immersion

1582
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:25,310
camp on August 26 this year it
goes to September 2nd one week,

1583
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:30,620
two sessions in that one week I'm going
to cause doing going and so is Dave

1584
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,420
Burke the real top gun?
Big Burke. Yes. We'll data,

1585
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,170
you know why he's going.
He sounded like a good deal.

1586
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:45,210
Good deal. Good deal. It does not do non
good deal things. Yeah. And good deal.

1587
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:48,240
Not in the sense where it's
like a good deal like um,

1588
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,390
you know like I'm going to get over.
It's like a good deal.

1589
01:31:51,391 --> 01:31:54,810
Like it's like it's good. It's a win,
win, win, win, win. It's linked. The best,

1590
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:58,590
best case scenario kind of thing.
That's what a good deal Dave is all about.

1591
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:03,430
That's just him. That's how he is. How he
rolls. Unless other people will be there.

1592
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:07,480
What would it be there?
Hopefully JP in life. Yeah.

1593
01:32:07,690 --> 01:32:11,810
Well they've just got his uh,
strike another stripe on the white belts.

1594
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:13,570
White belts. Yeah. So He's getting shit.

1595
01:32:13,571 --> 01:32:17,820
He might very well be there as you think
of your blue belt by then maybe. Sure.

1596
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:22,600
At this pace keeps trying to hard. Yeah.
And well he has prior knowledge as well,

1597
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:24,700
so yeah. He never know. Yeah. Yeah.

1598
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,890
So did you see immerse yourself and
you're just the best way to learn?

1599
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:28,390
In my opinion,
Marne too.

1600
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:34,130
And a lot even if you've never gotten go
cause last time I even went on the side

1601
01:32:35,351 --> 01:32:40,300
with beginner beginners, like one
day, zero days experience, boom.

1602
01:32:40,301 --> 01:32:44,170
We go through through some stuff
from, and I'm not saying, look cool,

1603
01:32:44,171 --> 01:32:48,700
I'm such a good teacher. I'm not saying
that at all. But after like that session,

1604
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:50,470
they were ready to go start rolling.

1605
01:32:50,610 --> 01:32:55,610
Humblebrag to say I know this because
that's what they said that not all of

1606
01:32:56,681 --> 01:32:58,690
them, but some of them
said that. Nonetheless.

1607
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,570
I'm saying there's a lot of
value that you did see value.

1608
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:06,460
If you've never done before, ever.
Clia or gin main.com check it out.

1609
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:08,650
See if it's for you.
It's for you,

1610
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:12,550
but you want to make sure and
check on that one. It's a good one.

1611
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:17,230
Also, Jack was a store.
It's called Jocko store.

1612
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:22,830
Go to a chocolate store.com so chocolate
store is where you can get shirts,

1613
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:27,730
tee shirts just equals freedom.
Get after it.

1614
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,600
Shirt with Jacola's big head on it.
This is good.

1615
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:34,960
Just for those days that you know
you're powering through some adversity,

1616
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:38,680
whatever. Got Chocolate. They were
right on your shirt. All good.

1617
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,920
Rash guards, hoodies, patches,

1618
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,840
beanies or either on there or they're
like literally on the way the wheels are

1619
01:33:51,221 --> 01:33:54,340
in motion. Man, I can't stop
it. Can't stop it right now.

1620
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:58,960
I'm a lot of cool stuff on the stickers.
Some details on there. It's good. Anyway,

1621
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,910
you don't have to get something
but gone there. Check it out.

1622
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:04,360
If you'd like something,
get something really good way to support.

1623
01:34:04,690 --> 01:34:09,070
Also for workout gear equipment.

1624
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:14,230
You want to introduce some variety
in movements in your workout.

1625
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,010
Good place to go.
Kettlebells, battle ropes,

1626
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:23,080
maces go to on it.com/jocko I want said,

1627
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:27,040
well actually more than once said
that Jacqueline's workouts are boring.

1628
01:34:27,070 --> 01:34:31,750
They're not. I get it. They're not
boring. I re retract that statement.

1629
01:34:31,751 --> 01:34:32,584
They're not boring,

1630
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:37,830
but if you run the risk of
your workouts being boring,

1631
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:40,660
just get some new equipment.
Actually it's good because you don't,

1632
01:34:40,661 --> 01:34:41,401
when you get new career,

1633
01:34:41,401 --> 01:34:44,970
like getting even like something as simple
as a jump rope, right? When you get it,

1634
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,140
it kind of rejuvenate a little
party. You want to, you know,

1635
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:50,150
it's like when you get a new key, you
want to go to practice more. You know,

1636
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:51,940
you buy some new running shoes,
he's like you,

1637
01:34:51,941 --> 01:34:53,500
you're kind of compelled to go running,

1638
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:56,950
so you're basically still
a five year olds, whatever.

1639
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:02,200
We kind of all are in a way and if you
go to [inaudible] dot com get you some

1640
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:06,530
new fitness gear, it'll introduce
a little variety to your workout,

1641
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:09,200
different gear, different
movement, different workout.

1642
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:13,940
Keep you on the path even more and
make it interesting. Made Fun, man.

1643
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,560
I think that's my opinion
anyway on it.com/jocko good
spot. Good way to support.

1644
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:23,060
Also when you're buying any of the
books that we review on this podcast,

1645
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:26,120
don't worry,
I organized them on our website,

1646
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,540
[inaudible] dot com and the book
section just clicked through there.

1647
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:32,480
Gets books through there and if you're
doing any other shop, behave, carry on,

1648
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:37,340

it. Also subscribed to the podcast.

1658
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:10,220
shareable stuff like so you
don't have to share a two,

1659
01:36:10,250 --> 01:36:13,580
three hour podcasts with someone and

In fact,

1662
01:36:18,921 --> 01:36:23,000
I would say even right when you pes press
play before you even get to like five

1663
01:36:23,001 --> 01:36:26,240
seconds and you check, see how long it
is. I think that's a normal protocol.

1664
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:29,870
That is a normal protocol. You see two
hours, you're clicking right out of there.

1665
01:36:29,871 --> 01:36:32,210
It depends what it is and depending
on what it is and it depends.

1666
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:34,640
It's not too often that you just got
a two hour block throne, you know,

1667
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:38,090
sit in the sit in, sitting aside randomly,
randomly, somebody sent me a video.

1668
01:36:39,010 --> 01:36:40,880
I'll watch it right now.
That's not happening. Yeah.

1669
01:36:40,881 --> 01:36:42,860
Typically doesn't happen like that,
but three minutes,

1670
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:46,880
four minutes to hang with that. Yeah.
And you made sure it with your, uh,

1671
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:50,540
you know your friend. Um, yeah.
So subscribe, Youtube Channel,

1672
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:55,590
good way to support also psychological
warfare. If you didn't know what that is,

1673
01:36:55,591 --> 01:37:00,230
is what it is.
It's an album with tracks on this album,

1674
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:03,620
not music tracks.
It's chocolate tracks and these tracks.

1675
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:08,300
Each track is designated engineered,
if you will,

1676
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:12,680
to help you.
Me This to help me is what it is.

1677
01:37:12,681 --> 01:37:16,730
But it will help you
get past little moments,

1678
01:37:16,731 --> 01:37:18,710
a weakness that you might encounter.

1679
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:20,090
I'm not saying everyone's
going to encounter it.

1680
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:23,030
It won't probably will encounter it,
but that's not the point here.

1681
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:26,030
The point is if you do encounter it,
you got something to help you.

1682
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:28,400
You got Jocko to help you.
That's a good deal.

1683
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,880
You want to skip the workout
or something like this.

1684
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:34,340
You don't feel like working out.
That's really what it is.

1685
01:37:34,460 --> 01:37:38,200
You don't feel like working out. The
comfort of not working out is, is,

1686
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:40,160
is distracting you is what it is.

1687
01:37:40,161 --> 01:37:45,161
But it seems more appealing than
the discomfort of working out.

1688
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:47,270
So what it is,

1689
01:37:48,170 --> 01:37:51,260
and then he listened to a track.

1690
01:37:51,450 --> 01:37:54,070
There's certain track for that chocolate
explains to you why you shouldn't miss

1691
01:37:54,071 --> 01:37:56,010
a workout. Boom. Power
through the workout, your

1692
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,980
good. And for every little weakness that
you might come across as a track for it.

1693
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:01,890
It's all good. Just check
it out and think like, Dang,

1694
01:38:01,891 --> 01:38:05,880
is that one of my weaknesses?
Boom. Get it. You're good to go.

1695
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:10,710
100% success rate in my
experience. Cool. Also, uh,

1696
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:12,090
you can get Jocko white tea,

1697
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:14,760
which I'm not agreeing to say anything
else about it cause I don't have to

1698
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:19,710
because this is a drink that guarantees
an 8,000 pound dead lift. And so what,

1699
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:23,910
what molds but more else can I say,
regardless of age,

1700
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,253
everyone should know.

1701
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:27,900
And you should be careful with that
because my eight year old daughter,

1702
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:32,340
she drank some Jocko white tea,
8,000 pounds,

1703
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:37,560
the get something. All right.
Books where the warrior kid,

1704
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:41,010
you probably already read the first way
of the warrior kid book. If you haven't,

1705
01:38:41,011 --> 01:38:42,670
you can get that right now.
Uh,

1706
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:48,050
you can also get where the warrior
kid to which you have not read yet.

1707
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:49,890
It's called the marks mission.

1708
01:38:50,610 --> 01:38:54,600
You haven't ready yet cause it comes
out April 24th, it has more lessons,

1709
01:38:54,690 --> 01:38:57,780
life lessons,
how to be a better human being.

1710
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:03,690
How's that for a good subtitle? How to
be a better human being. By the way,

1711
01:39:03,691 --> 01:39:08,100
my nephew, my actual nephew,
sure he likes the book to better.

1712
01:39:09,060 --> 01:39:12,270
He liked book one. He likes book
to better judge for yourself.

1713
01:39:12,510 --> 01:39:17,510
Preorder it now wherever books are sold
so that it will be at your door on April

1714
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:23,010
24th when it comes out. And on top
of that, when you buy this book,

1715
01:39:23,011 --> 01:39:27,150
you're helping another kid see this
book, if that. Does that make sense?

1716
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:31,370
Like when you buy this book, someone
else is gonna see it. It's gonna,

1717
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,260
it's gonna elevate it and other
people are going to see it.

1718
01:39:34,261 --> 01:39:37,530
We're trying to spread the word.
So the more we sell out of the gate,

1719
01:39:37,531 --> 01:39:40,230
the more kids are going to hear
about this book and the first book.

1720
01:39:40,231 --> 01:39:44,940
So get a copy for your kids, your
neighbor, kids, your classroom at school,

1721
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:45,930
the library.

1722
01:39:46,170 --> 01:39:50,550
Get as many copies as you can because
we're going to help out a lot of kids get

1723
01:39:50,551 --> 01:39:53,370
their lives on the path with this book.

1724
01:39:54,450 --> 01:39:54,960
Okay?

1725
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:58,920
If you don't believe me, check out to
Aiden. He's a warrior kid. 12 years old.

1726
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:01,920

1728
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:11,130
which is important.
Also,

1729
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:13,530
don't forget about discipline
equals freedom field manual.

1730
01:40:13,531 --> 01:40:17,220
The manual for getting after it,
which is what you should do.

1731
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:20,760
It's what we should all do.
How do you do it though?

1732
01:40:20,761 --> 01:40:23,790
That's the question and the answer
is in the field manual. This one,

1733
01:40:23,791 --> 01:40:27,930
it goes freedom field manual. If you want
the audio version, it's not on audible.
