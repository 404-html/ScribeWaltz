1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,700
Jocko. I have a question for
you. I know you're very busy guy.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,170
How do you find time to
read so many books? I have.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,850
I have many that I want to read,
but I've trouble having enough time.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,740
Any advice on how to set
aside time to do so? Uh, sure.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,510
All right. Lay It on me.
Make time. What are you,

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,870
what are you doing all day
the taken?

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,150
What are you doing all day? Are you
watching TV? Are you surfing the Internet?

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,330
Are you watching youtube videos?
That's my question.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,760
What are you doing before you go to sleep
at night? Are you looking at Twitter?

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,490
Are you looking at Instagram posts?

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,560
The Instagram videos.

12
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,960
Tell me they're not the like an
addiction. Yeah, you get the,

13
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,550
you get the Instagram video. Every one of
them is funny. They're 38 seconds long.

14
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,730
The one minute long.
Get to see people hurt themselves.

15
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:06,690
Get to see people do dumb things and
make you feel good about yourself.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,920
I didn't do that dumb thing and
someone else did. I can laugh at them.

17
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,370
How long are you going to look at those
videos for? When you could be reading. So,

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,990
so there you go. Stop wasting a bunch of
time. And then what about audio books?

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,390
What are you doing when
you're mowing the lawn?

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,660
What are you doing when
you're trimming the hedges?

21
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,400
What are you doing when
you're pulling weeds?

22
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,100
What are you doing when you're cleaning
the dishes? Get some audio books.

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,570
Get some audio books. What are you
doing first thing in the morning?

24
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,820
What are you doing?
Are you waking up,

25
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,000
checking your email,

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,530
sitting around waiting, you
know, wasting a bunch of time.

27
00:01:49,531 --> 00:01:52,200
Are you getting up early enough that
you could just get up, get out of bed,

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,130
go and read for 30 minutes,

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,590
30 minutes? That's what you have
to do. You have to make time.

30
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,390
There's plenty of time to read.
There's plenty of time to read.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,590
You probably don't want
to read as badly as your,

32
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,270
as you think. If you wanted to
read that bad, you'd make time.

33
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,560
You make time to breathe somehow.
You can make time to breathe.

34
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,930
You can make time to read. Yeah, I
wouldn't say it's the best. Yeah,

35
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,600
he would be a better one because
like, yeah, eat I think because read,

36
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,220
you can read while you're doing other
things sometimes, especially with just,

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,800
just kind of like as a,
as a, uh, so I'm reading,

38
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,950
I'm always have to be reading a book to
read a book for the broadcast, right?

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,510
Yeah. I had only read the first maybe
10 books that we read that we did on the

40
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:46,110
podcast. We've done a hundred or
something now. Probably more than that.

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,290
I'd only read like 10 of them
and maybe it, maybe a few more,

42
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,900
but I'd read them so long ago.
Maybe I'd read 30,

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,040
but some of them so long ago that just,
I had to reread them.

44
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,220
And so then you say to yourself,
okay,

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,190
so when would you know when I read all
the time or we'd go to bed greeting,

46
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,630
wake up reading, um, uh,
going in an airplane,

47
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,370
see people, what do people
do in an airplane? You Watch
a movie, I know you sleep,

48
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,530
they do all this stuff.
I sleep sometimes in an airplane,

49
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,600
but we're from not sleeping, get
us. Guess what I'm doing? Reading,

50
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:18,820
prepping for a podcast
and I can attest to, yeah.

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,650
Uh, what do you think is the,
like the biggest ones that people

52
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:26,060
are, um, you know, that, you know, the,

53
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:29,850
the biggest activities they could,
yeah.

54
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:33,840
They could just stop and it just, uh,
for me, I think the biggest time sucks.

55
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,060
Our Youtube.

56
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,220
I think Instagram.
Yeah.

57
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,820
I think those two are really, um, what's
the word? Stimulating to the brain.

58
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,600
And you actually get this weird
like, well, I actually like,

59
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,490
I'm going to learn a little
something from this right here.

60
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,640
I'm gonna take something away from this.
I'm going to veg out.

61
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm going to escape
from my world right now.

62
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,070
It's like escapism, right?
Yeah. And, and they look,

63
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,090
they actually have
algorithms that are stat,

64
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:11,040
know what you will click on.

65
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,290
They actually know that about you.

66
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,650
They mapped your little brain and know
that if they put up a video that has,

67
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:25,340
if they put up a thumbnail of a video
and it's got a heavy machine gun in it,

68
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,870
they, they know they got a good chance.
I'm going to click on it. Right.

69
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,940
And then they give it a catchphrase title,
right? Nope. They give it a catchphrase.

70
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,770
Title. Isis gets massacre.
I gotta watch that.

71
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,020
Yup.
I'll click 50 cal vs Taliban.

72
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,910
Oh, cool. Click right?
Yeah. Oh yeah, yeah.

73
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:55,260
And actually know words you're going
to click on. And that's, that's so,

74
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,430
and what do you get out of it?
You Watch it for 20 minutes.

75
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,860
Short game. Yeah. You get nothing out of
it. You get a book, you read, you learn,

76
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,050
you'll write something.
That's what you do.

77
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,670
Yeah. That, and actually
the youtube thing is,

78
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:12,340
it's funny if that's one of your things,
it's worse than,

79
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,130
it's not just youtube who's trying
to get you to watch the video.

80
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:19,190
It's the video makers themselves.
So you do has the Algorithm, oh,

81
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:22,670
they got it all kind of sorted out there.
And now the video makers,

82
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:26,900
they make titles like 50 cal versus
Xyz and the awful punching those too.

83
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,840
And guess what?
50 cal versus you can fill in the blank.

84
00:05:29,841 --> 00:05:31,550
You're probably going to watch that video.

85
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,170
It doesn't have that motivation
speech ever. Yes. Oh yeah.

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,161
So,
so in,

87
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:42,161
so destroys whatever destroys
reporter in interview.

88
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,590
Exactly right.
So once you really own,

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,200
cause those are the actual things are
actual, so basically doubled, right?

90
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:57,010
When you log on to youtube, once
Youtube pops up on your screen, Bro,

91
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,620
everyone on that screen is all
sucking your attention. Literally.

92
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,220
That's their job. Sucking your attention.
So yeah man, that's a big one, right?

93
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,510
Instagram. So here's the, here's the,

94
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,980
here's the one that it really hit me
really hard that Graham and I like

95
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:14,410
Instagram. It's like good. But if
you're like trying to read, you know,

96
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,650
if you want to read more or whatever,

97
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,160
consider like even like let's say we
start recording just for a second,

98
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,630
we're going to look on the bus,
on our phones.

99
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,150
We're gonna maybe checking email
and maybe we got a text or whatever.

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,480
And the Cha, the probability of
Instagram coming up on there,

101
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,120
we're going to open it. But the
probability of US opening Instagram is,

102
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,010
it's pretty significant. It's pretty
high. And you can scroll through there,

103
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,990
whatever. Even if you school
for two, three minutes, right?

104
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,420
You scrolled through there. Maybe you
what? You looked at a, I don't know,

105
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,780
1520 people's posts.
Read what they had to say.

106
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,090
If you have a, what do you, what do
you call like kindle or something,

107
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,330
but you do that same thing.
It's like can the end,

108
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,090
like you're saying you can read. Yeah.
Read instead. So if you had a camera,

109
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,380
like once you said like imagine
you're giddy being videotaped.

110
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:03,500
Like what if you're being videotaped all
day and all he did was calculate every

111
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:06,920
time you opened up Instagram or
Facebook or Twitter and or youtube,

112
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:08,420
all those Ptr,
every time you open up at,

113
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,060
and he had that scenario
in one average day.

114
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,300
Then you take all that time
and replace it with, you,

115
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,880
opened your kindle to read more,
busts out a book. You know,

116
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:20,270
you've bringing books or whatever we do.
And that's how to, instead of doing that,

117
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:22,530
you did the book, Brian, you know
how much reading you do, right?

118
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:27,080
You'd read so much. Yeah. So it's like
the, yeah, those are the time sucks man.

119
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,700
Your phone, it's so available, you know?

120
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,300
But probably you can read on your
phone too. That's a big one. TV Too.

121
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,570
He Watch TV. Not really.
I watch one show now.

122
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:43,190
It actually to Hawaii, five o and that's
it. Sometimes Shark tank. That's it man.

123
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,980
100%. It's weird. What does it,

124
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:49,160
how often does the Hawaii five o on
once a week and it goes in seasons.

125
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:53,520
So you got, how long has this season?
I Dunno. 13 episodes I guess. I Dunno,

126
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,330
I have no, no, no, but on the last,

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,950
I have watched one TV show recently.
It's called billions.

128
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,663
Oh Wow.

129
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,140
Little scenario unfolding on billions.
All right,

130
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:14,030
well you can actually actually,
there you go. Yeah. And keep in mind,

131
00:08:14,031 --> 00:08:17,450
it's not like I've never seen any
other show ever. It never will.

132
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,530
It's not that they're just saying,

133
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,110
you know how people they like made
watch Tino routinely and actually, um,

134
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,930
I will separate the fact that nowadays
you can watch TV in a different way.

135
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,390
Right? It's not like at eight
o'clock on a Thursday night.

136
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,480
You've got to sit there and watch it.

137
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,470
30 minutes show with the 30
minutes worth of commercials in it.

138
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,250
Yeah. Right. No, you can. You're, you're

139
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,950
on a flight somewhere.
You've read,

140
00:08:39,951 --> 00:08:41,480
you've got to take it easy
on your eyes a little bit.

141
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,820
If you start reading too much,
you've read for a long time. Okay.

142
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,350
You're going to stare out the
window for a little while,

143
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:48,650
listen to this part of a podcast or
something. Then you're like, okay,

144
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,560
my brain is like barely functioning.
Okay.

145
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,300
I'm going to watch an episode of billions.

146
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,410
Yeah. On you ever seen ballers?
I Dunno, the different, well,

147
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,600
I do know the difference.
I watched that for a little bit,

148
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,740
but you know like people have a
routine like tonight, you know,

149
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,520
every night for 30 minutes they
watched TV with their kids or whatever.

150
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,900
It's like that doesn't
really happen anymore. Yeah.

151
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,590
Next question. Really Sad.

152
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,010
How much time you can waste these days
with the distractions that are people

153
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:27,690
trying to get that time from you.
Yeah. Your discipline. Like when you,

154
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,440
when you first started saying
disciplining quick. Oh,

155
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:30,840
when I first started hearing it from you,

156
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,450
that was like one of the things
that popped into my head.

157
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:37,920
Like as being really obvious, like if
you are disciplined with your time,

158
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,820
you'll have a lot of free time.
Like a lot, a lot of free time,

159
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,790
way more than you would think anyway.
Because you know,

160
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,050
even when I'm like real busy, you know,
if I can accurately remember my day,

161
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,710
I can remember like just like five
minutes here, 15 minutes there like that.

162
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,960
I did something that was a waste of time.

163
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,980
And if you add up all those little
minutes you have probably hours proffer,

164
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,150
showers for to do,

165
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,360
do something for progressive,
you know, productive,

166
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,180
progressive, progress, your
life, valuable, valuable,
all those things in check.
