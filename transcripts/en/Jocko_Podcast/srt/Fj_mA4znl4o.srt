00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,680
This is Jocko podcast number
one 76 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,830
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Usually when I write a letter it is very
much overdue and I make every effort to

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:22,190
get it away quickly.
This letter however is different.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,720
It is a letter that I hoped you would
never receive as it is verification of

6
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:34,811
that terse black edge card
which you received some time
ago and which has caused

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,850
you so much grief.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,010
Okay.

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,420
It is because of this grief that I wrote
this letter and by the time you have

10
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:49,421
finished reading it hope that it has done
some good and that I have not written

11
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,510
it in vain.

12
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:56,790
It is very difficult to write now
of future things in the past tense,

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,210
so I am returning to the present tomorrow.

14
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:03,340
We go into action

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,460
as yet we do not know
exactly what our job will be,

16
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,410
but no doubt they will be a dangerous
one in which many lives will be lost.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,740
Mine may be one of those lives.

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,560
Well mom.

19
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,310
Okay.

20
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,810
I am not afraid to die.

21
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,443
Okay.

22
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,330
I like this life.
Yes.

23
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,110
For the past two years have planned and
dreamed and mapped out a perfect future

24
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,170
for myself.

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,450
I would have liked that
future to materialize,

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,230
but it is not what I will
but what God wills. Then.

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,230
If by sacrificing all of this, I leave
the world slightly better than I found it,

28
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,500
I am perfectly willing
to make that sacrifice.

29
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,190
Don't get me wrong though, mom,
I am no flag waving patriot,

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,430
nor have I ever professed to be
England's a great little country.

31
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,760
The best there is.

32
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,990
Yeah,

33
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,990
but I cannot honestly and sincerely
say that it is worth fighting for,

34
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,870
nor can I fancy myself in the role
of a gallon crusader fighting for the

35
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:25,400
liberation of Europe.
It would be a nice thought,

36
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,260
but I would only be kidding myself.

37
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,630
No Mom,

38
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,510
my little world is centered
around you and includes dad,

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,950
everyone at home and my
friends and Wolverhampton

40
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:47,000
that is worth fighting
for and if by doing so,

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,100
it strengthens your security and improves
your lot in any way than it is worth

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,270
dying for to

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,860
now.
This is where I come to the of this letter

44
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,820
as I have already stated.

45
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,120
I am not afraid to die and in perfectly
willing to do so if by my doing so you

46
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:13,120
benefit in any way whatsoever.

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,910
If you do not,
then my sacrifice is all in vain.

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,500
Have you benefited mom
or have you cried and worried yourself?

49
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:28,334
Sick.

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,860
Okay.

51
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,030
I fear it is the ladder.

52
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Don't you see mom that it will do me
no good and that in addition you are

53
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:41,320
undoing all the good
work I've tried to do.

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,330
Grief is hypocritical,

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,200
useless and unfair and does
neither you nor me and he'd good.

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,630
I want no flowers, no epitaph, no tears.

57
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,690
All I want is for you to
remember me and feel proud of me.

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,540
Then shall I rest in peace knowing
that I have done a good job.

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,253
Okay.

60
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,930
Death is nothing final or lasting. If it
were, there would be no point in living.

61
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,420
It is just a stage in everyone's life
to some,

62
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:30,690
it comes early to others late,
but it must come to everyone some sometime

63
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,850
then surely there is
no better way of dying

64
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,990
besides I've probably crammed
more enjoyment into my
21 years then some manage

65
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,290
to do in 80

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,220
my only regret is that I have not done as
much for you as I would've liked to do.

67
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,270
I loved your mom.

68
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,230
You were the best mother in the world
and what I failed to do in life I am

69
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:06,930
trying to make up for in death,
so please don't let me down, mom.

70
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,240
Don't worry or fret,
but smile.

71
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,680
Be Proud than satisfied.

72
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,560
I never had much money,
but what little I have is all yours.

73
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,890
Please don't be silly and sentimental
about it and don't try to spend it on me.

74
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,830
Spend it on yourself or the kiddies.

75
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,610
It will do some good that way.

76
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,243
Yeah.

77
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,090
Remember that where I am,

78
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,270
I am quite okay and providing,

79
00:05:45,271 --> 00:05:50,271
I know that you are not grieving
over me shall be perfectly happy.

80
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,420
Well mom,
that is all,

81
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,900
and I hope I have not
written it all in vain.

82
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,610
Goodbye
and thanks for everything

83
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,010
your unworthy son
Ivoire

84
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,223
and

85
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,970
that was a letter from
private Igor Rowbury

86
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
who served in the British army

87
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,980
in the South Staffordshire Regiment and
the letter can be found in a book called

88
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,430
last letters home.

89
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
Okay.

90
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,660
And it was his last letter home.

91
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,790
He was killed

92
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,420
in og Nem on 17 September,

93
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,280
1944 and the opening action

94
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,010
of Operation Market Garden,

95
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,360
which was conceived and planned and
championed by Field Marshal Bernard

96
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,803
Montgomery

97
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,150
and this massive operation overall,

98
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,480
it's generally assessed as a failure,

99
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,810
although history has been kind in,

100
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:26,370
some people look back and fee rise that
it did have a more positive impact on

101
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,920
the battlefield then
was initially thought,

102
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:32,610
but nonetheless it didn't achieve,

103
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,730
achieve its objectives and there was
a significant amount of casualties.

104
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,350
And as I said,
this was Monty.

105
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
Yeah.

106
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,740
Montes plan is the plan that he pushed.

107
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,980
And as I said on the
last podcast about him,

108
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:53,400
this is one of the things
that makes him controversial,

109
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,510
that Qi lead this,
this operation market garden.

110
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,080
Okay.

111
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,210
And as I said on the last podcast,

112
00:08:01,211 --> 00:08:06,211
he was able to redeem himself
somewhat in the battle of the bulge.

113
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:10,840
But this,
this negative was pretty impactful.

114
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,680
And with that,

115
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,100
that doesn't mean that there's nothing
we can learn from that situation.

116
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,990
We've covered it on the podcast, the,
that, that battle from that perspective.

117
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,480
And we have to learn,

118
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,110
we have to learn from people's successes
and people's failures just as we have

119
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:32,270
to learn from our own
successes in our own failures.

120
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,930
And on the last podcast we talked with
you about Monty's and view of leadership

121
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,180
and if you haven't listened
to that podcast yet,

122
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,740
it's number one 74 that kind of talks
a little bit more detail slightly about

123
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:46,880
Monte and his thoughts.

124
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:51,140
And we debated a little bit the
meaning of the word dominate,

125
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:55,380
which he kind of puts us one of these
driving forces as a leader. I was,

126
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,850
is the leader's ability to dominate.
And I talked about how,

127
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm not quite sure where
he falls with that word,

128
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,890
you know, cause dominate can
have a very negative connotation.

129
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,310
And I actually asked for feedback in a
bunch of people, gave me feedback, and

130
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,270
I think I landed somewhere
kind of in the middle.

131
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,160
I don't think it's then dominate
with the, with the, Hey,

132
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm just going to roll over my people.
I don't think that's how he meant it.

133
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,500
I think he, but I don't think he meant
it in like, Hey, I'm just dominate.

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,630
I dominate my skills
and that's why I'm good.

135
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:33,690
I think he meant it
somewhere in the middle. And

136
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,470
then I talked about the fact that one of
the other major important factors that

137
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,790
Monte talks about his morale,

138
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,930
and he wrote another little thing
about morale called morale and battle.

139
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,740
And I think, I actually wish I
would have covered this one first.

140
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:56,980
And this one almost trumps
the, the, the leadership,

141
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,910
his thoughts on leadership because I
think this is even more applicable and

142
00:10:00,911 --> 00:10:04,210
relatable,
but it's,

143
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,930
it's good solid stuff from someone that
led to massive numbers of troops in

144
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:17,550
battle and saw a lot of war war in World
War One and World War Two obviously.

145
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,990
So with that morale in battle,

146
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,410
and we're going to jump right into it.
Here we go.

147
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,470
This paper is an attempt to analyze what
is at the root of morale and battle and

148
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,660
thereby to discover how
it can be developed.

149
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,520
High Morale is defined as endurance
and courage in supporting fatigue and

150
00:10:39,521 --> 00:10:42,320
danger.
In other words,

151
00:10:42,321 --> 00:10:45,980
the quality which makes men go forward
in an attack and hold their ground in

152
00:10:45,981 --> 00:10:50,930
defense. It is the quality
without which no war can be one.

153
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,860
So this is, uh, this is, uh, uh,

154
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,590
and I'll get to this. In the end, he,

155
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,590
he talks about morale being the most
important factor on the battlefield.

156
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,300
Obviously I think leadership is the
most important thing on the battlefield,

157
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:07,700
and I'll break that
down a little bit later.

158
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:12,470
But from his perspective as a guy
that had led massive operations,

159
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,430
he feels morale is the
most important thing.

160
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
So without a doubt it is important.

161
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,920
Here we get into his thoughts on it, and
again, I think you're going to see this,

162
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,630
the stuff that he talks about,
morale, he seems to nail this,

163
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:32,870
I think even better than the
nails leadership. So here we go.

164
00:11:32,871 --> 00:11:34,370
The quality of morality in war,

165
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,240
the moral stature of some men increases
and their characters grow stronger and

166
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:39,074
more close,

167
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,040
closely knit in proportion
to the discomforts and
dangers which they are called

168
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:43,880
upon to face.

169
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,700
Okay,

170
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,170
I said this over and over again.

171
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,820
War War can make you stronger.

172
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,800
War Can make a better person.

173
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,590
This is something that Peter t and I
talked about when he first came on the

174
00:11:56,591 --> 00:12:01,420
podcast and we talked about families
that were slightly fractured and if they

175
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,920
have a, a major incident, a medical
emergency, somebody gets wounded,

176
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:09,550
somebody gets cancer. If the family's
close, it'll make them closer.

177
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,170
If the family's fractured, it'll blow them
apart. He's saying the same thing here.

178
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,200
Back to the book. Such men will
occasionally perform in battle.

179
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:20,770
Remarkable acts of selfless courage
and daring and will endure with

180
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:25,270
extraordinary fortitude and patience.
The burdens thrust upon them,

181
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,150
other men. However, we'll under
the stress of hardships or dangers,

182
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,650
surrender to fear or fatigue and will
allow their characters to disintegrate.

183
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,190
So it was the same thing that Peter
t was talking about with families,

184
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,140
and this is the same thing
with any team or organization.

185
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,440
You have a team that's pretty close
and they go through something rough.

186
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,970
They get even closer.

187
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,870
You have a team that's kind of fractured
and they go through something tough,

188
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,610
they're going to explode.

189
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,090
Same thing happens with people's
personalities and character in war.

190
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,010
This disintegration is usually,

191
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,520
we'll usually take the form of
a loosening of the moral fiber,

192
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:04,780
which results in timidity of
Action and slackness in appearance.

193
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,140
He talks a lot about appearance.
One of these guys in battle,

194
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:15,430
men who have kept a firm grip upon
themselves will appear clean and vital in

195
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:16,210
their appearance.

196
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:20,980
While those who have gone to seed will
be dirty and their appearance, we'll uh,

197
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,900
we'll be slovenly.
So he's one of those guys.

198
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,530
Okay.
If you don't look at,

199
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,270
and this is obviously this
is the much of the military,

200
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,530
they will judge you on how you look.
That's not always true.

201
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:40,590
Sometimes you get a guy that looks like
a rogue street person and he's a good

202
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:45,160
operator and sometimes not.
It depends.

203
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,490
Similarly,

204
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,360
timid officers will be found during quiet
periods in the line groveling in the

205
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:59,050
filth of some seller while they're
signalers and runners separated from the

206
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:03,640
light attempt to do their jobs by
the flame of a guttering candle.

207
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,010
And these latter cases,

208
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,300
there has been a general loosening of
the character due to a partial surrender

209
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,163
to fear.

210
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:16,380
So you get these timid officers that
are out there and they cower and they're

211
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:21,880
scared and they, while their troops
are up trying to do their job.

212
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,640
In extreme cases,

213
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,870
men who have become afraid have
sunk to the level of beasts,

214
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,210
no longer in full control of themselves.

215
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:36,211
They have become as sheep
or rabbits unable to act or
alone or think rationally.

216
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,910
Their instincts have
become those of the herd.

217
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,710
They are either paralyzed by fear
or gripped by unreasoning panic.

218
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,180
Such men are exceptions, but they are
a reminder of the value of high morale.

219
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,680
The good soldier,

220
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,340
the man with high morale has not
surrendered to fear and has maintained his

221
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,100
personal standards.
The bad soldier,

222
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,550
the man with low morale has
become incapable of dependent
action of independent

223
00:15:05,781 --> 00:15:10,370
action and has to some extent shed
apart of his human individuality.

224
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,110
So this is what you get people at all
freaked out and they don't act for

225
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:16,430
themselves anymore.
There's going to fall to her.

226
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,080
Morale is a mental and moral quality.

227
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,550
It is a quality peculiar to human beings
because it is essentially the product

228
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,530
of a mind with a conscience.

229
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,500
Okay?

230
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It is that which in battle keeps men up
on humanities level as opposed to being

231
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:37,664
a beast.

232
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,560
But humanities level's not high enough
because the strongest human instinct is

233
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:43,760
the instinct of survival.

234
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Morale is also that which develops
man's latent hero wisdom so that he will

235
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:54,660
overcome his desire to take the
easy way out and surrender to fear.

236
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,050
Okay?

237
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,750
So you gotta be a little bit beyond
human because the human instinct,

238
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:01,420
the strongest human instinct is, I'm
just going to stay alive. That's my goal.

239
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,440
You gotta be, you gotta be more than
that. You gotta be better than that.

240
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,333
Okay?

241
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,850
It is necessary now to make
clear what high morale is not.

242
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,770
It is not contentment or satisfaction.

243
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:20,530
Bread for ease or comfort of living.

244
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,190
Okay.

245
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,190
Both of these container
hint of complacency and
acceptance of luxury as an end

246
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:29,894
in itself.

247
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,220
High morale is far more than any of these
for it implies essentially the ability

248
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,890
to triumph over discomforts and
dangerous and carry on with the job.

249
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,490
So if you're one of these leaders and
you're in a leadership position and you

250
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:44,000
think, well, you know, um, what,

251
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,770
how do I raise my, the morale of
my men? Give them luxury days,

252
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,900
give him feel.
Von Luxury days,

253
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,480
the o negative not happening
that that doesn't do it

254
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,770
back to the book. Nor is no because,
sorry, because what you have to do,

255
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,630
you have to give them challenge.
You have to give them discomfort or not.

256
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:09,530
You have to give them, they have to face
discomfort. They have to face danger.

257
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,010
And that's what increases morale when
they face nape. Triumph over that.

258
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:16,490
That's what, that's what
increases morale. A pizza.

259
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:18,400
Okay.

260
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,840
And find satin sheets
do not increase morale.

261
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,370
They might do a little surface nudge,
but they don't increase Rupp morale.

262
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,630
Otherwise your morale would be through
the roof, off through the rooms all day.

263
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,570
We'd sold it.

264
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:38,570
So the morale is so it's like not to be
confused because you do need like the

265
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,110
rest between six.
Right.

266
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,770
And it's different and you can't just beat
people down all through. Right, right.

267
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,630
You can't, you can't, you know, you have
to get sleep, you have to get rushed,

268
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:51,660
you have to have level of comfort
or your morale will get beat down.

269
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:56,160
But that can't be the primary aim of
you as leaders to provide comfort.

270
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,510
It's not like, Hey, let's boost morale by
letting people sleep or whatever. Right.

271
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,230
Or not letting them see, but you
know, yeah. Give him love. Give them,

272
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:05,160
give them two days off.

273
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,220
How about one day off and we come
back and train hard and work. Yeah.

274
00:18:08,221 --> 00:18:09,180
It seems like you wouldn't,

275
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:12,180
you wouldn't give them the day off
if they don't need the day off.

276
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,130
Like you need the day off
for something very specific,

277
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:18,020
like some sort of a fatigue situation
or whatever. Bottom line is,

278
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,020
it's a dichotomy, right? Can you go too
far with comfort and pleasure and leisure?

279
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:22,890
Yes,
you can.

280
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:28,430
Can you go too far with discipline and
hardness and sternness and scarcity of

281
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:32,310
resources? Yes, you can. You have to
find a balance somewhere in the middle.

282
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,660
I think the point here is that
people lean towards, well,

283
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:41,010
if I want to increase morale,
I just need to give luxury to the troops.

284
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,000
That's the, that's the wrong way
to lean. You should actually lean,

285
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,290
I'm not saying go full bore,

286
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,430
but you should lean in the direction
of hard training, discipline,

287
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,540
lean in that direction.

288
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:54,500
Don't go full bore in that direction
and lean in that direction. Yeah.

289
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,640
It's almost like, I mean,
you'd think about it,

290
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,150
it seems like making them feel what?

291
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:03,590
Like empowered or strong, right leg.
That's kind of the result you're going to,

292
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,120
let me just break it. Break
it down for you. Real simple.

293
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,110
If you go and you have a good training,
Jujitsu, how do you feel when you're done?

294
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,660
How's your morale? Pretty
high. Morale is high.

295
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,610
If you sit there and watch TV all
day and you eat a pizza and a donut,

296
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,700
how do you feel at the end of
the day? How's your morale?
Shabby. Morales. Shabby.

297
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,130
You know, if you train Jujitsu nine
hours for 14 days straight. Yeah.

298
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,330
How do you feel broken down, right? And
then how do you feel when it's like,

299
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,330
hey man, day off today. Echo
all good. Hey, guess what?

300
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,150
I ordered some pizza for you too. It's
common. It's gonna be here in 15 minutes.

301
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,220
We're gonna chow down. We're
going to watch the fights. Cool.

302
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,170
That's a good morale boost.
We're all good. Yeah,

303
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,120
but you've got to find that balance.
Yeah. All right. Back to the book.

304
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,570
Nor is high morale achieved through
fitness or healthiness alone is important.

305
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,870
Not to confuse the idea of
physical happiness with morale.

306
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,580
The happy faces of men after a good
game of football are not necessarily the

307
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:04,320
faces of men with good morale. Morale is
a mental rather than a physical quality.

308
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,480
A determination to overcome obstacles
and instinct of instinct driving a man

309
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,130
forward against his own desires.
Oh,

310
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:17,070
driving a man forward against his
own desires. That's a good one.

311
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,653
That's a good one.

312
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,920
And he detaches the physical and the
mental part a little bit more than I do.

313
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,750
I think they're a little
bit more closely related.

314
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:27,990
I think that when you're in good physical
shape, it helps your mental morale.

315
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,300
But he goes on to say this,

316
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:35,301
which is spot on high
morale is not happiness.

317
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,500
Happiness may be a contributory factor
in the maintenance of morale over a long

318
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,770
period, but it is no more than
that. A man can be unhappy,

319
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,290
but can still regularly
and without complaining,

320
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:52,000
advanced and defend within the
terms of the definition. So that's,

321
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,280
so that's an important
thing. And again, this is a,

322
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:57,400
this is a trap that leaders
get suckered into. Hey,

323
00:20:57,401 --> 00:21:01,870
if I can make my people happy
than morale's good. No, no pizza.

324
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:04,610
We'll make your people happy, but
it won't increase morale. Hmm.

325
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,590
It might increase morale if you can
give it at the right time for the right

326
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:11,650
reason. Do you eat Hawaiian Pizza? No.

327
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,420
Is that just a lie? That's a
complete violation. We don't even,

328
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,860
we don't even need that kind of pizza in
Hawaii, generally speaking. Correct. Well,

329
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:24,940
there you go. That's the thing. It's like
it's like Canadian making. What does,

330
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,930
what does Hawaiian Pizza
due to your morale?

331
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,690
Apparently its inhibitor.
Yeah. It's an inhibitor. Well,

332
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,780
you know like Canadian Bacon? Yes. Like
Canadians. Like, Hey, is this Canadian?

333
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:41,720
You know Canadian Bacon's just a little
piece of ham basically. Yeah. You go, hey,

334
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,650
someone from Canada and be like, Hey,
this is Canadian bacon. The lake. No,

335
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:49,210
that's him. Have you made
that up? Have you ever had an
English muffin before? Yes.

336
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,510
You can't get them in England
because they don't, yeah,

337
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,830
they just call him just like French
fries, right? Yeah. Or wait is in French.

338
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,200
In France. They're called
something else though. Chips.

339
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:01,600
They're now called French
fries. No, that's England.
I think they're called pawn.

340
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,950
All right, that makes sense.
Same deal then. All right.

341
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,440
This is an important other,
this again, you can see them.

342
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,400
I was in going through this to
figure out what I was going to,

343
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:16,580
what parts I was going to single out. I
ended up doing so much of this one. Yeah,

344
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,790
because almost every line is like,
yes, you need to know that. Yes,

345
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:24,190
I need to know that. I need to
remember that. So here's one.

346
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:28,540
High morale is not toughness.
This one caught me a little off guard.

347
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,030
Some very tough men in this war of turned
out to be very disappointing in action.

348
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,050
Toughness is a physical
and not a mental asset.

349
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,060
Tough men will occasionally perform an
isolated act of bravery. Morale however,

350
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:46,180
is not a quality which
produces a momentary act.

351
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:48,940
It influences behavior at all times.

352
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:53,710
So that's completely true.

353
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,840
And it's true and it's true in combat.
It's true. And training even like some,

354
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,250
somebody like going through what basic
seal training. There were some tough guys.

355
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:06,790
They're like tough where you go though.
That guy seems like a tough guy. Quitter.

356
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,050
And then, and then there's guys that
get through buds, it's like, oh,

357
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,350
they were toughing buds.
Like they did some good job in bonds,

358
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,290
but it has nothing to do with how
well you're going to do as a seal.

359
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,150
Like it does. It's, I would say
there's some correlation, but it's,

360
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,010
it's a very loose correlation.

361
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Being a good seal buds trainee has very
little to do with being a good seal in a

362
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:37,330
seal team. And I think that sometimes
surprises people. But then again,

363
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,480
it shouldn't really surprise people
because being good at Budz Budz is,

364
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,290
is a physical evolution,
has very little to do with you,

365
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:47,690
with your mentality.

366
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,920
And it has very little to do with
leadership and unit cohesion.

367
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,410
And so to show up at a team,

368
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,030
what's the most important
thing when you get your team?

369
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:00,560
The most important thing when you get to
a team is to be a team member and be a

370
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:05,330
leader in that team or a follower in
that team. If you aren't those things,

371
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,830
you're not going to be good. You
can be super tough. That's great.

372
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,200
And there's times when it pays to be
tough and you definitely as a seal,

373
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,940
you can't not be, you can't not
have some level of toughness.

374
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,150
You know? When I think
about being a seal there,

375
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:29,030
stuff that you just do on a regular basis,
that when it's your life,

376
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,790
when it's just the way your life is,
you don't really think about it.

377
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:36,290
But when you take a step back and
you think about what you like,

378
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:40,370
when I think about my old job, and I'm
talking about going back to the 90s right?

379
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,230
Oh, we're going to go, we
have dive week, which is,

380
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,340
or dive training.

381
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:50,960
So you'd go for like four or five weeks
of dive training and you're diving two

382
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:54,200
times a day.
It's your wet suit,

383
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,130
your your you wetsuits wet
when you're putting it back on,

384
00:24:58,131 --> 00:25:02,210
and then you're going to go get in a boat
and you're going to drive for an hour

385
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,490
and a half up the coast,
and then you're going to,

386
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,350
it's going to be dark and you're going
to put on your Drager rebreather and

387
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:12,800
you're going to get in that water again
and you're going to kick in the darkness

388
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,520
with bio luminescence flying around
you for three and a half hours.

389
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,220
You're going to get into this
random harbor, you're freezing cold.

390
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,173
You're going to plant.

391
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,220
I'll a limpid and fake limpet mine
on some big navy ships somewhere.

392
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,120
Then you're going to paddle your swim,
fin your way back out.

393
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,830
You're going to run out of oxygen.

394
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,230
Once you run out of oxygen are going
to come to the surface and then you're

395
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:37,520
going to swim on the surface
for another 48 minutes,

396
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,110
and then you meet up with that little
Zodiac boat. You get in, you're freezing,

397
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,160
you're exhausted,

398
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,150
and then you drive an hour and 20
minutes to get back to core auto.

399
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,950
When you get back,
you're going to debrief,

400
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:51,350
you're going to get take
care of your Zodiacs,

401
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,520
they're going to take
care of your dive regs.

402
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:53,930
Then you're going to take
care of your personal gear.

403
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,070
Then you're going to take a shower and
they're going to sleep for three hours

404
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,150
and you're going to wake up with
another dive mission. Tasking,

405
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,810
you're gonna do the same thing
again. Just cold, wet, miserable.

406
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,020
That's the life.
That's the life.

407
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:14,630
So do you got to have some
level of mental toughness?

408
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,610
Sure you do and every has got that.

409
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,900
But this part talking about like,
you know,

410
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:23,400
when you start talking about leadership
and being a team player and being a,

411
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,720
being a good leader and being a good
follower and being smart in tactically

412
00:26:29,031 --> 00:26:33,740
sound and being a good decision makers,
those are the things that matter.

413
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,800
When you start talking about the
just the idea of being tough,

414
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:40,490
it's like that's cool and it's important
and everyone in the teams has that or

415
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:44,030
most people in the teams
have that baseline. Uh,

416
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,100
because it is a little bit challenging
too to make it through seal training.

417
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,860
If you don't at least have some level,
it does happen.

418
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,170
You get some guys where you think,
man, what happened to you or you know,

419
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:52,950
you just break down.

420
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,380
Some people have the idea that once they
get through seal training and they're

421
00:26:55,381 --> 00:27:00,000
done, you know, you shouldn't be in seal
training to go through seal training.

422
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,270
You should be at seal training to,
to get to the seal teams,

423
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:06,660
to serve your country, to go into
combat, to take the fight to the enemy.

424
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:09,810
That's why you joined the seal teams,
not to see how tough you are.

425
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,880
So
next in brief,

426
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,910
high morale is a quality which is good
in itself and is Leighton and all men.

427
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,040
It maintains human dignity in an in
enables fear and fatigue to be overcome.

428
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,560
It is involved with the
idea of a conscience,

429
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,100
but it should be not confused with
fitness or happiness or toughness.

430
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,480
So he goes to pretty good
lengths to make that distinction.

431
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:38,820
Section two basic factors of morale.

432
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,420
It is now necessary to consider what
factors constitute the morale of the

433
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:43,620
soldier in the heat of battle.

434
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:48,030
Certain factors may be described as a
essential conditions without which high

435
00:27:48,031 --> 00:27:49,470
morale cannot exist.

436
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,460
These four basic factors are one,

437
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,150
leadership to discipline.
Three,

438
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,920
comradeship for self respect,
a fifth factor,

439
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:06,921
devotion to cause must exist but need
need not necessarily influenced all of the

440
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:08,340
soldiers.
Finally,

441
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,290
there are numerous contributory factors
which are of great importance but not

442
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,690
essential conditions.
So that's what he's got.

443
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,500
The four things that you have to
have in order to have high morale.

444
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:23,010
And then the first factor of
course is leadership, which again,

445
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,320
he's supporting my argument
that leadership is the
most important thing on the

446
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:27,330
battlefield. If you don't have leadership,
you're not gonna have good morale.

447
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,390
So right there, I already got
you beat Mani. And guess what?

448
00:28:32,391 --> 00:28:36,870
His second one is discipline. Where
does that come from? Leadership. Sure.

449
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,010
What about comradeship? That's comes with
all these things come from him. Anyways,

450
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,110
we'll get to that. Leadership. Morale is
in the first place based on leadership.

451
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,170
Good morale is impossible
without good leaders.

452
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,790
The quality of leadership is
one which must be studied.

453
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Human beings are fundamentally alike
in in that very common characteristics

454
00:29:00,571 --> 00:29:02,880
apply to all men in varying degrees in.

455
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,600
This is why such a great dichotomy of
humans is that all humans are the same and

456
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:10,440
all humans are different,
right? Like you know it's true.

457
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,080
How can that be true?
All humans are the same.

458
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,720
All humans are different and
that's a completely true statement

459
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,330
in battle. The most important of
these characteristics is fear.

460
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:26,220
All men are afraid at one time or another
and to a greater or lesser extent in

461
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:28,980
moments of fear,
they band together and look for guidance.

462
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,680
They seek for a person to give decisions.

463
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:36,000
They look for a leader in times of war.

464
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:39,960
The leader has opportunities denied
to him in peace. The difficulties,

465
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,470
dangers and discomforts,

466
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:45,670
inseparable from the battlefield make men
cry out for the leadership they can do

467
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:48,970
without in peace.
At such moments,

468
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,890
men are too weak to stand alone.

469
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,690
They find the burdens too great to bear
and their own selves unequal to the task.

470
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,430
The leader himself accepts the burdens
of others and by doing so earns their

471
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,600
greatest and the right or their
gratitude and the right to lead them.

472
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,520
So challenging times
things are going sideways,

473
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,960
bad things are happening.

474
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,980
That's when people are most
susceptible to leadership.

475
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,023
Hmm.

476
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,650
This is completely sure ever, ever seen
a team dynamic where like when everyone,

477
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:24,190
everything's going good
pretty much like you can get,

478
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,060
it might be hard to tell who the leader
is and then all of a sudden something

479
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:28,894
happens,

480
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,320
something that's chaotic or something
that's challenging happens and then you

481
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:39,910
can see that leader just rise to the top.
I've seen that a million times.

482
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I seen that a million times in platoons
through training and how you kind of not

483
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,520
really knowing what's going
on, who's really good, who,
who's really running this.

484
00:30:45,521 --> 00:30:45,970
Boom.

485
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,930
You start hitting these guys with some
down men and some IED in the training

486
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,660
battlefield. You'll see the real
leaders will start to step up.

487
00:30:52,661 --> 00:30:56,350
Hopefully they will step up at
all, but, and this is totally true,

488
00:30:56,351 --> 00:31:00,730
you see people want to be led,
people want to be led.

489
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:04,630
There's going to be sometimes a little
leadership vacuum and sometimes you got

490
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:07,630
to step in and fill that
leadership vacuum back to the book.

491
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,340
Consider a platoon I. E. 30 men
in action in the line. They,

492
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,280
the men are drawn from all
classes into all types.

493
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,090
They are there in the line because they
have obeyed a long series of orders,

494
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:23,110
which it was easier to obey than
to disobey, but now the test comes.

495
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,560
It is easier for them not to obey orders.

496
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:30,910
It is easier for them to stay where
they are behind the hail and not advance

497
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:35,230
over the crest into full view of the
enemy who lies in weight of beyond the

498
00:31:35,231 --> 00:31:36,970
dominant motive force,

499
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:41,200
which drives them over
the hill is the leader.

500
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,340
It is his quality of leadership above
all things which inspires the men to

501
00:31:47,341 --> 00:31:52,150
action. And this is one of those,
he paints that out very clearly.

502
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:53,130
You when people talk about,
well you know,

503
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:55,590
in the military of just does what you
said, cause you're in charge, right?

504
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,030
Oh we'll try that once everyone's
going to die. Well once you're,

505
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:02,700
you're lives are at stake.
People just don't Roger Up to say,

506
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,320
Oh that's hey echoes plans kind of
lame to go charge the machine gun nest,

507
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,820
but you know what? He's in charge. I'm
going to go do it. No, doesn't work.

508
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,160
You have to lead
these men recognizing their leaders,

509
00:32:14,161 --> 00:32:17,520
some quality which they
themselves do not possess.

510
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,520
That quality is decision.

511
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,450
Fear makes men sluggish and indecisive,

512
00:32:24,451 --> 00:32:28,620
unable to decide and act for themselves.
And this is,

513
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,320
this is, you know, people talk about, uh,

514
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,660
being frozen by fear or,

515
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,400
or have you ever had that thing where
you're quite sure what you're gonna do?

516
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:41,990
Like you, oh, well, I don't
know if I want to do this.

517
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:44,800
I don't know if I want to even like a,
like something stupid like a,

518
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,900
not something stupid, but you know, buying
a house, right? That's a big purchase.

519
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:51,020
You're going to lay down a bunch of money.
The market could go up or down.

520
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,790
You're committing to a
payment for 30 years.

521
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:58,940
There's not so many things in life
you commit to for 30 years. Basically.

522
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:01,810
There's only one other one.
You're getting married. Right?

523
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,590
Is there any other commitment?
That's 30 years, I guess.

524
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:05,230
You get a tattoo that's a lifetime,
right?

525
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,600
So there's these decisions that you
have to make and sometimes we don't.

526
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,730
Sometimes you see people don't
want to make decisions, right?

527
00:33:13,731 --> 00:33:15,010
They don't want to make a decision.

528
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,940
What's making him indecisive
or you think about it,

529
00:33:16,941 --> 00:33:18,980
what's making people indecisive is fear.

530
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,420
They're afraid of what that
outcome might break. Yeah.

531
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:27,890
So if you find yourself being indecisive,
instead of asking yourself,

532
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,850
is this the right decision
or wrong decision? Ask
Yourself, what am I afraid of?

533
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,210
Back to the book of the leader's power
over his men is based on his ability to

534
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:40,820
cut through this,
this fear paralysis,

535
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,550
and in doing so to enable
others to escape from it,

536
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,570
the rightness of the decision
taken by the leader is irrelevant.

537
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,070
Think about that from a
leadership perspective.

538
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:54,440
If there's a decision
that needs to be made,

539
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,120
whether you're right or
wrong is irrelevant. What you
need to do is be decisive.

540
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:04,280
What matters is that the decision should
be taken and that the leader should

541
00:34:04,281 --> 00:34:06,800
shoulder the responsibility
for that decision.

542
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,520
The leader must convince
his men of its rightness,

543
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,540
even though he himself might be
maybe uncertain of his own judgment.

544
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:19,910
If the leader will decide, the men will
follow and fight. If there is indecision,

545
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,770
they will hesitate and flee

546
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,110
in short fight and survive
or fear and be slain.

547
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:33,090
The leader decides,
yeah,

548
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,703
moving on.

549
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,920
The leader's power of in of the leader's
power of decision results from his

550
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:49,461
ability to remain impersonable
in the crisis has calmness,

551
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:54,720
prevents panic,
and his resolution compels action.

552
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,870
It follows that this if falls from this,

553
00:34:57,871 --> 00:35:00,330
that the leader must be
less fearful than his men.

554
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,250
He need not be impervious to fear. Since
men require a human figure to lead them,

555
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:08,490
what he must do is radiate
an atmosphere of confidence,

556
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:11,370
which will show his men that
he has less afraid than day.

557
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,860
He must have the moral courage to stand
firm when his men are wavering in this

558
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:20,850
respect, they will judge him by his
power of thought and action and crisis.

559
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,270
Fear destroys the faculty of
thought and Paralyzes Action.

560
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,400
The leader must continue to think longer
than his men and his thoughts must lead

561
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:33,610
to action. Oh, there you go. Don't panic.

562
00:35:33,611 --> 00:35:36,940
Don't freak out. You got to stay
calm. And how do you do that?

563
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,660
You train for it and how do you,
and when you train for it,

564
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,230
what do you learn from the training?
You learn how to say, too detached.

565
00:35:42,231 --> 00:35:44,640
That's what you learn how to do. That's
how you keep your emotions in check.

566
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:45,780
You don't let them get ahold of you.

567
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,020
The leader's greatest asset is the
ability to act normally in abnormal

568
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:52,854
conditions.

569
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,040
This is normal face 101 to continue to
think rationally when his men have ceased

570
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:02,130
to think to be decisive and action
when they are paralyzed by fear.

571
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:03,980
Okay,

572
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,813
so this is a,

573
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:10,090
that section is something you should
always strive to do from a leadership

574
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:15,890
perspective. Stay calm, don't panic.

575
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,610
Think about what's happening. He
didn't say it, but I'm going to say it.

576
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,660
Detach mentally so you don't get caught
up in the emotion and the fear and the

577
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:26,270
chaos.
Next,

578
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,890
the object of training must be firstly
to select those who possess within them.

579
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,990
The potentiality is of leadership and
second, to develop these pen potentiality.

580
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,070
So yes, you've got to look for
who's going to be a good leader

581
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,280
and then you've got a home.
That leader.

582
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,920
This is accomplished by giving
the leader responsibility. Boom.

583
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,930
My favorite cure for leadership problems
is put people in leadership positions.

584
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,370
A leader's character will
develop in proportion to the
responsibility with which

585
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:57,180
he has been in trusted. The more
responsibility you put on someone,

586
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,380
the more responsible they're going to
become. Think about the little kids,

587
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,850
right? Think about a little kid. The more
responsibility you give a little kid,

588
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,950
the more mature they're going to be,

589
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,320
the more responsibility
they're going to take. Yeah.

590
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,760
It starts with making your own peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches. Yup.

591
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:19,330
You should be doing that on your own.
As soon as it's physically possible,

592
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,670
you're going to make a mess. Guess what?
Then you learn to clean up the mess.

593
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:27,630
Every time you break down and you make
that PB and j for your little child,

594
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,670
you're taking responsibility away from
them and you're making them a weaker

595
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:37,060
human being and they
feel it and they feel it.

596
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,580
I made my, she's six, my daughter
[inaudible] set the table. You know,

597
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:46,810
they'll try to say yes at the table.
Yep. And she knew what it was,

598
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:50,800
but she hadn't really gone through
the whole deal before. So sure enough,

599
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:54,550
she's like, you know, she didn't
want to, but I'm like, hey, you know,

600
00:37:54,551 --> 00:37:57,100
you set the table, this is
what you do. You know, you're,
you're kind of, you know,

601
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:59,170
this is your job,
this is your duty kind of thing.

602
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,730
So once she set like the first one yeah.
And she did it correctly,

603
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:08,380
she was rolling with it. It was her table.
She was like, Hey, I'm, I'm here. Boom.

604
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:12,190
She was making decisions. All this
donorship Oh, full lot being up. Oh yeah.

605
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:15,430
And you could tell just in her tone,
Kinda like she was super empowered.

606
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:16,770
Little six year old. Yeah. You know,

607
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,760
where and kind of to look on the whole
situation where this was someone who

608
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:25,330
didn't want to do it, didn't, it was
a chore. They want to do the chore,

609
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,650
but you know, you implement
it. You know what I mean?

610
00:38:29,651 --> 00:38:33,250
In my case correctly. Do you give
them ownership? That's what you did.

611
00:38:33,251 --> 00:38:35,020
Echo Charles.
You gave your daughter

612
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,870
your job. This is your responsibility. You
do. This is how you do it. But you do it.

613
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:45,100
You make it happen. That, and I use that
term a lot and make it up and it's weird.

614
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,230
I don't know what it is about that term
with my specific kids cause that's what

615
00:38:50,231 --> 00:38:54,870
that feels good. Yeah. Like
you have influence over this
whole situation about it.

616
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,440
When you're a,
as a human being,

617
00:38:56,441 --> 00:39:00,540
it's kind of weird that you
can make things happening
straight up. Right? Yup. Yup.

618
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,310
It's a positive thing. Yeah man.
And yeah, that's a good one.

619
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:05,560
Making it and make it up and
make it out. And you know, like,

620
00:39:05,561 --> 00:39:10,220
cause and adults do this too. I do this,
we'll do this. Maybe you don't. I Dunno.

621
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,660
But you know how like if you
say, Hey, can you do this?

622
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:17,080
And then whether you don't want
to or you don't know how to,

623
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:20,830
you're just sketch about, you know, the
whole thing. You ask a lot of questions,

624
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:22,780
well what if this,
like people do that.

625
00:39:22,781 --> 00:39:27,470
It's almost like they put a
bunch of excuses preloaded, yeah.

626
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,880
To indicate, hey, I can't really
do this, you know, kind of thing.

627
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,020
And it's almost like just maybe it's
like them being hesitant and maybe it's

628
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:38,560
everything, you know, all this thing.
So my kids will do that a lot, you know,

629
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,120
like all but well what is,
you know,

630
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,150
all these questions kind of thing
indicating they don't want to do it.

631
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,240
They want to throw up all this
smoke so you finally just go, Hey,

632
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:50,980
I'll do it or whatever. And I started
saying that, I was like, I don't know,

633
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:54,310
make it happen. And they just do it.
They just make it happen. It's all there.

634
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,250
I mean sure the job won't be the
greatest the first time kind of thing,

635
00:39:57,251 --> 00:40:01,750
but they have that attitude of just
making it happen. You know, you ever,

636
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,150
you ever heard like the old guy
that's like when I was your age? Yeah.

637
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:13,110
Sometimes it's me. No, you just made
me think that cause I do that, Eh,

638
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,690
you know, I'll be like, when I was
your age, I wasn't a seal platoon.

639
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:20,260
Are you kidding me? That doesn't work
in my case. Did that ever work for you?

640
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:21,370
It does,

641
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:26,230
man will never work because you know
when one of my older kids that are my age

642
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,770
when I wasn't a seal
platoon, it's like, you know,

643
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:33,771
you're asking me how to do like some
such simple life thing or asking me to do

644
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:40,280
it for you. Like are you serious right
now? Are you serious right now? Yeah.

645
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,650
When I was your age, I was
in a seal platoon. I was
going on deployment overseas.

646
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,920
I had guns and radios and encryption
devices and you're telling me what you

647
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:53,620
know, whatever the thing is,
you can't make that happen.

648
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,000
Is that where you're at right now?
And then couldn't be what I was your age.

649
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:02,140
I always feel like when my dad or whatever
would say that and I feel like if I

650
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:06,100
say to my kid, they're going
to be thinking like it's
not cool. It's not. It's,

651
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,660
it's,
I'm actually saying this,

652
00:41:07,661 --> 00:41:11,290
putting myself like in a little bit of
check we talked about last time, you know,

653
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,070
you can't just be like, well, when
I was, yeah, no, you need to be,

654
00:41:15,071 --> 00:41:17,980
I need to do a better job.
But it is good.

655
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,950
The thing is it is good
to cause the way my,

656
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,890
there'd be usually my older
daughter because my oldest daughter,

657
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:25,910
cause she's the one that
actually is of age when I was in,

658
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:30,700
she actually takes it in a,
in a positive way.

659
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:35,420
Like she'll have a look on her face.
Like I am actually being like really,

660
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:38,860
really dumb right now
to be even asking this.

661
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:42,560
Like I can obviously figure this thing
out. Whatever it is. You know some,

662
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,450
you know the DMV.
How do you set an appointment at the DMV?

663
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:50,140
Are you serious right now? Are you
serious right now? Make it happen.

664
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,070
You can't figure that out. You'd never
heard of something called Google.

665
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,900
Think of how easy things are now. But you
can't even do that. No, not happening.

666
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,300
I wasn't, uh, I wasn't damn seal
platoon when I was your age.

667
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,580
I was responsible for stuff.
They were telling me,

668
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:07,070
you can't figure out how to
set an appointment at the
DMV. Are you kidding me?

669
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,050
This is what I think is the hypothesis.

670
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:14,060
I think that you saying enough
like stuff to your older daughter.

671
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,300
In this case where she can relate,
where resonate,

672
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,170
like I get what you're saying and yes,

673
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,000
I think that once you see what
always drew Joe's in a seal platoon,

674
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:26,540
she goes perp, she checks out. No,
that's what I need to be careful of.

675
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,540
That's what I need to be careful of.
The other thing I'll get from my kids,

676
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:33,390
which is more your, you know your, you
will you, you know what I mean? They,

677
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:37,550
they kind of, yeah. I'm not
like, well that's of course
you did that. And I'm like,

678
00:42:37,551 --> 00:42:41,630
no, no you did not true.
It's not just like,

679
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,440
oh I did that because I'm more
squared away than you are. No,

680
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,930
you're actually more
capable than I ever was,

681
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:52,000
but doesn't need to step up your game. I
know and hit, and this is my whole point.

682
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:53,980
The thing is, you're correct with
what you're saying. You're crying,

683
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,850
but from the kids' standpoint,
they don't believe that. Like mine,

684
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,460
if my dad would tell me that kind
of stuff, I'd be like, yeah I can.

685
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,150
I literally think that's it.
Cause you're,

686
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:06,050
you not to say that you're tougher or your
whatever. It's like bright, you're you,

687
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:09,010
you lived in the caveman days,
leave me alone about like figuring,

688
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,550
but then if you're like, hey,
go make the DMV appointment,

689
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:17,150
go and Google figure it out kind of thing
that, that relates to them. I was like,

690
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:21,090
yeah, he's right. Yeah. And if she's
a grownup essentially, you know,

691
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,160
she's going to choose to read when
my son was like 10 years old. Yeah.

692
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:31,030
And in my son's a good surfer and I was
out surfing with them and watching them

693
00:43:31,581 --> 00:43:36,050
surf and I said, you know, he was
paddling. I just caught a wave,

694
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:39,320
like beautiful wave and he's
paddling out and I said,

695
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:43,340
in a little while you're going to
be a better surfer than I what I am.

696
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,470
And I thought he'd say, oh, that's cool.

697
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,700
He looked at me like I was completely
insane and like, it was the craziest,

698
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:52,820
like it'd be like he,
you could see in his eyes,

699
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:56,780
he thought that that was not a cumin Lee
possible thing that would ever happen.

700
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:59,750
I mean, imagine that. Like that's
the look in his face and he kinda,

701
00:43:59,751 --> 00:44:04,610
he kinda just completely shrugged it off.
I was like, yeah, right. Yeah. And I mean,

702
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,680
six months later he was better than me
and now he's just like infinitely better

703
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:14,210
than me. But to your point, when you know,

704
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:18,560
when you're looking up at dad,
then sometimes it's,

705
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:23,060
this is an unachievable thing.
Yeah. And actually that's not true.

706
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:28,090
And the young kids got to recognize that
they can outperform their lame parents

707
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:32,040
if they put their mind to it. Yeah.
And same thing that happens with

708
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,180
subordinates, right? You
have your subordinate on
your team and you think, hey,

709
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,260
you have more skill than I ever had.
You have more talent than I ever had.

710
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,330
If you apply it correctly,

711
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,020
you will be able to outperform
me without question.

712
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,240
And sometimes people look at you like,
oh, you're crazy. That could never happen.

713
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:53,220
It's like, no, it can happen. It
can happen. But you got to train.

714
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,670
That's another thing is people
think, oh, well, you just,
this is natural. No, no, no.

715
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:01,150
Oh No. Oh yeah. The on the other
thing, you know, I mean that's why,

716
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,720
that's another thing like when
we, when I was on with, um,

717
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,020
when we had captain plumb and Jim Lawn
and they were like throwing me in the

718
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:14,350
basket of being like them and
I'm like, hey guys, this is all,

719
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:15,630
just check yourselves.

720
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:21,110
I'm 47 years old and I'm barely hanging
on to like figuring this stuff out.

721
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:27,020
I'm not in the about in the game with you
guys in terms of figuring out what you

722
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:31,850
all have figured out. I mean, those
guys are leaps and bounds and,

723
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:37,200
and iteration upon iteration
of knowledge above me and,

724
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:41,630
and I'm just sitting there thinking,
take it easy. Captain Plumb. Yeah.

725
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:45,540
But again, that's just kind of a,
a matter of perspective. You know,

726
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,560
like things can seem so much
like they can seem like a very,

727
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:55,710
something very specific, but just
because of your perspective, you know,

728
00:45:55,711 --> 00:46:00,360
you don't get a whole picture, you
know, you know? Yeah. All right. Check.

729
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:01,680
Going back to the book.

730
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,450
His position as the man responsible for
the lives and wellbeing of his men must

731
00:46:06,451 --> 00:46:07,800
be impressed upon him

732
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:13,620
in battle is preop his preoccupation
with his men's affairs.

733
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:16,020
We'll give him less time
to think of his own fears.

734
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:22,100
The mere fact of responsibility
will increase the leaders
powers of decision and

735
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:27,000
make him confident of his
ability to handle any crisis.

736
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,060
So you've got to train people
in these challenging situations.

737
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:34,110
Training must also seek to equip the
leader with the other qualities which will

738
00:46:34,111 --> 00:46:38,910
help him in his task. Here are those
qualities. A leader should be efficient.

739
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,290
He should possess self confidence.
He should be firm,

740
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,140
and just in his dealings with his men,

741
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,370
he should be clear cut and
definite in giving orders.

742
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,490
He should pay attention
to administrative details.

743
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,480
He should prepare his men and advanced
for any new experience they may have to

744
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,670
meet.
All these things are important,

745
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,940
but they can never be a substitute for
a decision in action and be calmness in

746
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:08,364
crisis.

747
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,550
Yeah, stay calm. Now,

748
00:47:14,551 --> 00:47:19,530
one thing that I get a little nervous
about talking about decision and action is

749
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,120
sometimes what that means,

750
00:47:21,121 --> 00:47:26,121
whether the way that translates to a young
platoon leader is not going to make a

751
00:47:26,401 --> 00:47:30,030
decision right now. Hey,
everyone, you know a bone,

752
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:34,930
I'm going to jump into it and you can't
do that. You have to do assessment.

753
00:47:34,931 --> 00:47:39,520
You have to look at what the
situation's going and actually you know,

754
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:42,430
you've got to have a protocol
of how you're going to make
those decisions, right?

755
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,530
You've got to think about way
the way it's going to go down.

756
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,260
You can't just jump at the first
thing that pops into your mind.

757
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:49,780
You need to think about it.
You need to think about the options.

758
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:51,820
You need to think about the
consequences of those options,

759
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:55,660
and then you need to see if you can
move in the right direction without full

760
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:59,140
commitment, right? Do you
have to occasionally make
full commitment on decision?

761
00:47:59,141 --> 00:48:00,340
Yes.
If you're,

762
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:04,840
if you've got ambushed and
you're in the kill zone,

763
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,900
guess what? You're going to have
to do assault through the ambush.

764
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,990
That's what you're going to have to do it.

765
00:48:08,991 --> 00:48:12,280
You're going to have to do it decisively
and powerfully and with full a hundred

766
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,113
percent commitment,

767
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,820
but if you take some rounds but
you're not sure if it's an ambush,

768
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,270
well, you might not want to necessarily
assault through that position,

769
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,870
so you need to think. You need to allow
things to develop a zoo. It's a very,

770
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:27,490
it's part of the art

771
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:32,800
of leadership was teaching
young seal leaders. Okay,

772
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,330
you need to let the situation develop.
Here's the problem.

773
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,430
Once the situation starts developing, if
you let it develop too far, it's gone.

774
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:47,290
It's out of control now, right? It's, it's
a, it's a little, it's a little problem,

775
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,700
right?
When you look at it,

776
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,240
then you need to look at the problem and
make sure you understand the problem.

777
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,210
Meanwhile,
the problem in some cases is growing.

778
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:00,010
If you allow the problem to grow too
much now you can't control the problem

779
00:49:00,011 --> 00:49:02,950
anymore and you're going to get
crushed by the problem. If you,

780
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,560
if you see a small problem and you
jumped right into solving the problem,

781
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:06,011
that might,

782
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:09,070
the problem might not be what you thought
it was and you went out at the wrong

783
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:09,904
direction.

784
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:14,650
So there's a fine line like
decision and action is important,

785
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,730
but thoughtful decision is what
it should be. Thoughtful decision.

786
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,940
And the reason I'd keep trying to stress
and articulate to people that you don't

787
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:29,911
necessarily need to make a
full commitment to a plan.

788
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,980
You can take them,
you can take a smaller step,

789
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:37,060
an iterative step in the right
direction before you just jump in.

790
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,270
So that's just important to think about.

791
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,380
How does all that compare to making
no decision? We'll make no decisions.

792
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:46,420
The worst thing you can do,
right?

793
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:48,340
Make no decision standing
there in the kill zone,

794
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:49,960
getting overrun by the
enemy and everyone killed.

795
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:50,920
That's the worst thing you can do.

796
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,390
We want to at least make some
kind of a decision. Yeah.

797
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,680
So that's why I think he stresses.

798
00:49:56,681 --> 00:50:01,681
So the importance of decision inaction
so much is because he's probably seen

799
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:05,830
people be indecisive and battle and
it's a horrible, horrible thing.

800
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,050
So yes, you want to be decisive, but
let's take that one little step further.

801
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,390
We want to have fought full decisions.

802
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:18,910
Do we want to have a mental 20
minute debate over the decision? No.

803
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:22,730
A thought can take five seconds.
You can let it sit.

804
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,650
You can let us situation develop for for
eight seconds and you go, wait a second.

805
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:29,640
I think this is what's happening. Let me
confirm. Do I see anyone over there? Uh,

806
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,810
Yup. What did the enemy fire
is increasing. You know what?

807
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,690
We need to make this move. Boom. You do
it. That's what we're talking about. Yeah.

808
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:39,961
Back to the book.

809
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:44,160
These are two vital attributes of a
leader with which he will succeed and

810
00:50:44,161 --> 00:50:45,600
without which he will fail.

811
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:50,670
These two vital quality vital qualities
exist in varying degrees in every leader.

812
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:55,260
Those men who possess them to a limited
extent can nevertheless become adequate

813
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:58,290
leaders by being trained in the
quality's already a numerated.

814
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,800
Such leaders must in the
first place be efficient.

815
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,210
This efficiency will impress itself on
the men thereby creating an atmosphere of

816
00:51:06,211 --> 00:51:10,860
confidence with which will partially
compensate for any lack of personality.

817
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:16,920
By this means training can make men into
competent but not outstanding leaders.

818
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:18,760
Okay.

819
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,510
There's another aspect of leadership
in its relation to morale.

820
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:28,350
The best type of leader earns
the respectful admiration
of his men because he

821
00:51:28,421 --> 00:51:31,360
possesses certain good
qualities which they lack.

822
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:38,250
A brutal leader who disregards
the feelings of his men
will not infuse them with

823
00:51:39,671 --> 00:51:42,790
the quality of self respect,
the morale of the troops.

824
00:51:42,791 --> 00:51:46,870
He commands regardless of his qualities
as leader will not be the highest.

825
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:51,460
So even Monte who kind
of comes across as being,

826
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,670
you know, aloof to the
troops. He's, there you go.

827
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,050
The brutal leader is not going to
have good morale. Hmm. Factually

828
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,280
an element of self respect,
self respect.

829
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:09,100
There's a whole section on self
respect that's coming. Yeah. But yes,

830
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:14,190
if you have a dog and you beat
the dog and your a brutal leader,

831
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,190
the dog will not have any self confidence.
It'll be a broken dog.

832
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:20,620
You can do that with human beings too.
Yeah.

833
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,970
If you bark at your people and
you break them down all the time,

834
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,650
they won't be able to stand up.

835
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:32,400
Another way to do that in a more lower,
or should I say less brutal way,

836
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:36,940
is to do everything for him for sure.
Same thing meant no easy myself. Like

837
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,040
yeah, if you're setting the
table all the time, yeah.

838
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,010
Your daughter never realizes that
she has the capability of doing that,

839
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:47,420
handling that job.
She's tying shoes,

840
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:51,050
carrying backpacks, like all that,
you know, everything. It's like man,

841
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,640
if you're helping your kids,
you're hurting your kids. Yeah.

842
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,850
And it's, yeah. And that clarifies it
even more and it's so true. I mean,

843
00:52:57,851 --> 00:53:01,960
once you kind of latch on to that idea,
you just see it everywhere. Like men,

844
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:06,430
you ever see these kids? Like, I dunno,
like a TV show or documentary type,

845
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,600
whether in,
I don't know,

846
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:12,601
somewhere in Asia or some village where
the four year old girl goes and kills a

847
00:53:12,821 --> 00:53:17,320
snake, skins it and then walks like
in the mud for another mile back home,

848
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:21,320
cooks it for their family, you know, like
any like, Dang, that girl's for. Yeah.

849
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:26,100
And she can do like, I can't even do that
stuff, you know, kind of thing. It's a man

850
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,700
can put it into perspective where it's
like these are kids who are just like

851
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,790
making it happen.
I'm beings are so adaptable.

852
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,110
Like you see the little gymnast kids,
they're six years old,

853
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,340
iron cross,

854
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,860
there's crazy do an athletic
feats that are just insane.

855
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,090
And why is that? Well, because they
were put in that position. Yeah.

856
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,700
And and train hard now some of those,
some of that,

857
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:53,400
sometimes those kids trained a little
bit too hard I think. So they lose,

858
00:53:53,401 --> 00:53:57,240
they can lose other aspects of their life.
But Dang,

859
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:00,060
if you wouldn't like to be able to do
an iron cross when I was six years old,

860
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:03,870
come on now. Yeah, the point still
told you remains. Yes, exactly right.

861
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:08,580
So let your kids develop and
let your subordinates develop.

862
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:12,540
Give them responsibility, build
them up back to the book. Moreover,

863
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,600
it is important to realize that while
men are dependent on the word of the

864
00:54:15,601 --> 00:54:16,434
leader,

865
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:22,170
they are capable of much
independent action on their
own and are even capable of

866
00:54:22,351 --> 00:54:25,830
making their own decisions. So this is
kind of, this is kind of funny, right?

867
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,600
It's Monte basically saying, look,
I've got a little surprise for you.

868
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:36,090
We'll surprise your troops. Can
actually think for themselves. Yeah.

869
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,270
Imagine that. And so obviously this is,
this is decentralized command, right?

870
00:54:39,271 --> 00:54:43,410
This is it. And you have to
let your subordinate leaders
lead. He goes on to say,

871
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:46,980
British soldiers have much native
character in individuality.

872
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,610
What is required is that the leader shall
give the initial and vital decisions

873
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:53,880
along with which the men can work.
So yes,

874
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,630
and you know what?
This is actually,

875
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:00,420
I'm glad that glad that money said
it and that kind of funny way.

876
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:04,800
It's the same thing that we're talking
about with kids where you think, oh,

877
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,080
well my kids probably not
capable of doing that.

878
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,880
Your kid is capable of doing that.

879
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,420
Your kid can go out there and kill a
snake and bring it back and skin it and

880
00:55:12,421 --> 00:55:16,170
cook it. You just have
to allow them the, the,

881
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:20,670
the room to, to let that happen
and give them the authority.

882
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,380
Empowered them to do it. Yeah. Yeah.

883
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,090
Fully in that.

884
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:28,470
It's so night and day to the
other actually last night. Oh,

885
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:33,480
I wasn't making chicken. Yeah, making
chicken and I usually make rice in Hawaii,

886
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:37,410
make rice with everything anyway, so
I'm like, okay, make the Eggo. Hey,

887
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,700
I tell my daughter she's six again. By
the way, I was like, hey, make the rice.

888
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:44,400
Here's the thing. I showed her how
to make rice maker Rice isn't hard,

889
00:55:44,401 --> 00:55:48,510
but it's not like, I mean
in most some steps. Yeah,

890
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,210
there's some stuff for sure it
and it wasn't, well for me anyway,

891
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,070
before I taught her how to make rice,

892
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:56,490
it wasn't real obvious that a six year
old should be making rice, you know,

893
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:00,930
like not in a rice cooker too, by the
way. Just like on the stove regular. Um,

894
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,150
but I thought at that point I was like,
hey,

895
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:07,500
why can't I just show her how and teacher
how even if I don't teach her in one

896
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:10,650
day, okay. The next time we make rice,
which is just going to be soon, I'll,

897
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,180
we'll go over it again kind of thing.

898
00:56:12,181 --> 00:56:15,150
Why should she not know
how to make rice right now?

899
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:19,350
Why should I have to do this for her
or whatever. Anyway, I teach her,

900
00:56:19,351 --> 00:56:22,110
I tell her to make her rice super simple.
Boom.

901
00:56:22,111 --> 00:56:24,100
Last night was the first time where

902
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:27,670
it was her responsibility to make rice.
She makes rice six years old,

903
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,350
makes rice boom boom. But you know what?
Our current in the right direction.

904
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:36,010
Exactly right. That's the point
is too is that you as a leader,

905
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,170
as leaders, the same thing. You let
your let your guys run the operation,

906
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,950
let your troops step up and take
control of something that you and your

907
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,000
egotistical maniac mind think only
your people do it. Guess what?

908
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,170
Your boys can get it done too.
And if they,

909
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,600
if they bat of 88 instead
of a hundred cool,

910
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,090
next time they're going to get
a 92 and then I'm after that,

911
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:01,960
they're going to get a 96 yeah.
Cause that's a big obstacle to right.

912
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,500
Mentally it's kind of like sure I could
teach him how to do it, but why would I?

913
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,710
Well yeah, you see that, you see that even
more. Is he in parenting? It's like, cool,

914
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,320
my kid couldn't make the rice but in,

915
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,610
in a team environment,
our ego,

916
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:19,780
our ego flares up because we
want to be the one. Right. Yeah.

917
00:57:19,781 --> 00:57:22,010
Especially if you can do it at a 10 yeah.

918
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:26,440
Guys only do at an eight at the end of
the day and your job is done and you feel,

919
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,260
you feel like that's your little power.
You know, that's my little power.

920
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:33,580
It's like well you know, you really
know how to do is I'm going to come to,

921
00:57:33,581 --> 00:57:35,040
I better come down and
check out how your bag,

922
00:57:35,041 --> 00:57:36,050
you're prepping this stuff cause you know,

923
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:39,070
you know I'm kind of the man your
yacht, that's where it is. Yeah.

924
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,310
Kind of like when you like let's say
they had to like screw on some stuff or

925
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:44,560
okay I used to work at a moving company.
Right.

926
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:48,160
You know this and at the end you load
up the crates and you put them on the

927
00:57:48,161 --> 00:57:50,890
truck and you have to tie in
with a certain kind of not right.

928
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,740
You learn how to tie that. Not the
kind that's super tight, but you,

929
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:56,410
all you gotta do is pull one string
together. Yeah. Cool little thing.

930
00:57:56,411 --> 00:58:00,230
So I learned how right and yeah, one of
the the supervisor or whatever he Blake,

931
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,950
yeah, go tie it off or whatever
and I could totally do it.

932
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,470
We've been doing this for
a or whatever and then,

933
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,430
but he'll go and he'll
check in and he'll like,

934
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,350
and then he'll pull it just
a little bit more, you know,

935
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:12,580
like as it's be like the little signature
on it, a signature from the mass.

936
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:15,970
He would just say what you're doing
right there. But we do that all the time.

937
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,120
We like to have our own little
rice bowls. Tika Rice, right? Sure.

938
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:23,140
That's a weird term. But you've heard
that term before, right? Like it, hey,

939
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:28,450
you want somebody messing with his rice
bowl? Meaning like this is mine. Like, Oh,

940
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:32,800
I'm the guy that does this part of the
job and I don't want anyone else to know

941
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:35,620
how to do it. That's my little rice
ball. Stay out of my rice bowl.

942
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,620
There's a lot of rice bowls. I was
never into that. Well at least,

943
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,060
at least once I was actually in leadership
positions, I was very, I'm, I'm not,

944
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:45,130
I don't care. Like, oh,
you're good. You come on,

945
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,690
come on and grab some of this rights.
Because if you can,

946
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:49,480
if you can take my rice ball
from me, guess what? I can
go find another rice bowl.

947
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:53,560
I'll bring it in here and we'll start.
We'll have more rice. That's good man.

948
00:58:53,810 --> 00:58:58,660
Because it's not as intuitive,
you know? Everyone thinks that.

949
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,460
Everyone thinks that they're, everyone
leans towards, Hey, I want to be the guy.

950
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,530
Yeah.
The ego flares up

951
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:14,620
back to the book. Good morale
can be created in a narrow
sphere by a good leader,

952
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,670
but a platoon or company has obviously
influenced by the general feelings

953
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:22,280
existing in a division or army. So
now we're talking, so you got multiple

954
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,080
layers, multiple layers above the platoon
or the company. You've got the army,

955
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,220
you know the division.

956
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:34,130
Good morale implies confidence in the
high command and in the plan and he

957
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:36,320
capitalized plan the plan.

958
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:41,060
A strong leader on a high level can
have a powerful influence on the general

959
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:43,730
attitude of the men. Have a
platoon. He cannot, however,

960
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:47,810
influence their movements over the last
flute, few vital yards of an attack.

961
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:49,580
On the other hand,

962
00:59:49,581 --> 00:59:54,581
a strong leader on the low level can make
as men carry out a single fine attack,

963
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,630
but he cannot sustain
their morale indefinitely.

964
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:02,360
If there is a lack of confidence in
the high command and it's planned,

965
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:07,970
that's a challenge.
It's a challenge if your troops,

966
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,420
if your troops are looking at the strategy
going, what the hell are we doing?

967
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,690
Like you can get the guys through
one attack or two, three missions,

968
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,240
but eventually they were saying, hey,
what's going on? Why are we doing this?

969
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,510
This doesn't make any
sense and vice versa.

970
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,130
A leader cannot do without discipline.

971
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,320
Okay.

972
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:29,480
You were thinking about when I
say discipline on the podcast,

973
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:33,380
you should put some little,
every time I say it,

974
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,830
especially when I say something like this,
a leader cannot do without discipline,

975
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,960
is aim must be to create such a discipline
body of men that all his orders will

976
01:00:47,601 --> 01:00:49,040
be obeyed instantly.

977
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,630
This habit of obeying leaders,

978
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,530
orders must be so instilled into his
men that they will carry on and fight,

979
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,510
even though he himself falls.

980
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:02,870
There's a problem with for that
statement right there, right?

981
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:07,040
The aim, this aim cannot be
achieved without discipline.

982
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:12,700
The second factor of morale is discipline.
So a couple things here. First of all,

983
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:16,750
I don't want my team to instantly
obey all my borders without question.

984
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,140
If I tell them to do something stupid,
I actually want them to tell me no.

985
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:23,080
On top of that,

986
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:28,240
if you think for one minute that
all your people do is obey you,

987
01:01:28,270 --> 01:01:29,170
that when you die,

988
01:01:29,171 --> 01:01:33,160
they're just going to suddenly sprout
leadership skills and start leading.

989
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,290
You're wrong.
You have to.

990
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,880
You have to raise them in a way and
treat them in a way that they are being

991
01:01:39,881 --> 01:01:43,030
challenged as leaders themselves,
and they're being allowed to lead in.

992
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:43,980
They're stepping up and leading it,

993
01:01:43,981 --> 01:01:46,660
and they're not waiting to instantly obey
everything you do. Because if you're,

994
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:49,540
if all you're doing is waiting for orders,
you're not being proactive.

995
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:51,670
You're not leading.
Decentralized Command isn't happening.

996
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,620
And if something happens to me,
you're going to freeze.

997
01:01:55,330 --> 01:01:59,560
So this little section from Monte,
no,

998
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:04,090
I don't like it.
Discipline is something that is important.

999
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:06,010
You have to understand that
you have to have discipline,

1000
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:07,630
standard operating procedures.

1001
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,780
You have to have discipline to
stay within those procedures.

1002
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:13,420
But on top of that you have to have the,

1003
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:18,400
the freedom to when those procedures
aren't working to say, hey boss,

1004
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:23,040
this isn't a good, here's what
we should do instead. Hmm. Now

1005
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,530
does this mean you and I are going to
have a debate in the middle of a firefight

1006
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:30,450
over what the plan is? No, because we
work together. We trust each other.

1007
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:32,130
You know what I'm coming from,

1008
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,820
I know where you're coming from and when
I make a call you're going to do it.

1009
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,670
And by the way, if you make a call,
even though I'm senior to you,

1010
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:43,440
if you make a call, guess what I'm going
to do? Get someone to do follow. Yes,

1011
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:46,250
I'm going to follow you if you
like. Hey Jocko, punch. Right?

1012
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,200
Get ready to fight these guys.
And I'm the senior guy.

1013
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:52,020
But you just told me to do that. Guess
what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna do it.

1014
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,260
I'm gonna support you. So
that's, that's what you want.

1015
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:00,900
Um, you, you have to be
careful because as people,

1016
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:05,700
if you have someone who's personality
is sensitive to that, yeah.

1017
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:10,760
Right? And you say, Hey
Jocko, to try give, give them,

1018
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:15,390
get on their flank. And my
response is, excuse me a minute,

1019
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:20,190
just heard, do you think you are
actually, I'm in charge of this platoon.

1020
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,220
Why don't you just lock it up?
We're not going to punch. Right.

1021
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:25,110
And we're actually gonna move.
You know what I mean?

1022
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:27,520
That's what we can get into
that situation all day long.

1023
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,090
Guess what's going to happen to all of us?
We're all going to die.

1024
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,140
So we have to figure that stuff out.
We have to figure out that,

1025
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,430
that we have to work together.
But at the end,

1026
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:42,600
one of us has to submit to the situation
to submit to the other person's

1027
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:46,680
leadership. And by the way, there's 16
people in a platoon. In a seal platoon,

1028
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,230
there's 30 or 40 in an infantry platoon,

1029
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,680
it's pretty easy to get in the habit
of like, Hey, when the boss speaks,

1030
01:03:52,681 --> 01:03:55,140
we're all gonna submit
to what he's saying. Oh,

1031
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:58,950
if the one of my platoon sergeant speaks,
okay,

1032
01:03:58,951 --> 01:04:02,010
well he barks out something,
guess what? We'll submit to that.

1033
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:06,990
Occasionally someone else will rise
up and see something. We have to,

1034
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:11,670
we have to work and train together so
that we know when we need to submit to

1035
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:15,180
someone else or when we, or when
we need to say, hey, negative,

1036
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:17,160
we're not doing that. We're
going over here. These are,

1037
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:18,870
these are challenging things,
right?

1038
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:22,380
It's think of how easy for
think of how easy it is to,

1039
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:26,100
to have the Monte attitude and be really
easy for me to say right now. Like, Hey,

1040
01:04:26,101 --> 01:04:27,750
listen, this is what happens.
You'd have to have your men.

1041
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:29,400
So discipline when you tell them
to do something, they do it.

1042
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:33,000
That's the easiest solution,
right? That, okay, great.
Talk was put out the word, oh,

1043
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:35,880
by the way, if I get hurt, fall the guy
that's in the second chain of command.

1044
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:37,890
Okay, cool. That's easy.
That's an easy day.

1045
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,310
Right now we're going to win every time.
No wrong cause guess what?

1046
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:43,080
Occasionally me,
I'm the leader.

1047
01:04:43,081 --> 01:04:46,740
I'm going to make a bad decision
and somebody needs to check me.

1048
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:50,790
Now are you gonna check me every
single time? No you're not.

1049
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:53,040
Are you going to check
me? He, you know what?

1050
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:55,620
We're going to work together so much
that if you think you know what,

1051
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,750
I'm not sure jock was
making the right call,

1052
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,790
but at least I'm going
to start to execute it.

1053
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:03,510
I'm going to keep a heads up on to move
forward and then if I see what I think

1054
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:05,640
might be a problem happening,
I'm going to say something,

1055
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,400
but my response out of the
gate is we're going to go.

1056
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,320
That's the kind of thing
that's going on here.

1057
01:05:10,321 --> 01:05:13,740
This is a dynamic environment
interacting of human beings.

1058
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:15,210
It's freaking challenging,

1059
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:20,560
but to blanket everyone when I tell
you to do something, you do it. Yeah.

1060
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:24,880
I want instant obedience to
everything that I say. Again,

1061
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,910
that works great.
94% of the time,

1062
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,030
6% of the time it's an utter disaster.
And everyone dies.

1063
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:34,810
So we don't want to allow for that. We
want to allow some flexibility in there.

1064
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:39,220
That is harder to do.
It's harder to have that flexibility.

1065
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,540
It's much more challenging,

1066
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:45,820
but it gives you such better capability
and survivability that that's how you

1067
01:05:45,821 --> 01:05:48,790
want to set it up. It takes
a lot more. That's why.

1068
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:52,780
That's why the more advanced you get in,

1069
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:56,560
the more tactically advanced you get,
the more there is of that.

1070
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:59,500
So if you go to a marine corps,
infantry platoon,

1071
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,930
they're going to have
less pushback and less,

1072
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,330
they're going to have more obedience,

1073
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:07,990
more just straight wrote obedience
as they should. Because guess what,

1074
01:06:07,991 --> 01:06:08,890
an 18 year old marine,

1075
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:13,990
it doesn't have as much knowledge as a
25 year old staff sergeant like aura or

1076
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,320
the platoon commander that went to the
basic school and he's right. So there's,

1077
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:22,060
you're going to have these situations
that are going to was so in a,

1078
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,000
in a normal infantry platoon,
there's going to be less pushback.

1079
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,350
You get into a seal platoon, well now
you've got a bunch of experience guys.

1080
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:31,100
Just about everyone there has a few pumps.

1081
01:06:31,101 --> 01:06:32,410
The new guys aren't going to say anything,

1082
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,440
but the guys with two or three platoons,
they're going to say, hey, boss,

1083
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,050
not a good call. Or they're going
to give you some pushback. Why?

1084
01:06:38,051 --> 01:06:40,630
Because you've got a more
experienced fueled of people,

1085
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:45,880
so it takes more practice to get that,

1086
01:06:46,570 --> 01:06:51,010
to get to be able to interact together
properly and have that flowing chain of

1087
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:56,011
command that's docile and and can and
can't expand and contract and can move

1088
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:01,540
from one person to the next dynamically
as a mission is happening. I mean,

1089
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:06,400
there's times in in close quarters
combat where basically there's a,

1090
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:09,880
there's a person at the front of the train
and that person rotates out every few

1091
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:09,881
seconds.

1092
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:13,570
There's tactical situations where there's
a new person making the calls every 10

1093
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,840
seconds. Think about that.
That's tough. That's radical.

1094
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,870
To have a new person making a
call every 10 or 15 seconds,

1095
01:07:19,871 --> 01:07:23,170
there's a new person doing it. How do
you do that? Well, they understand.

1096
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,060
Everyone understands.
They understand the tactics,

1097
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:27,220
they understand how we work together.
That's what we want.

1098
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:29,710
As opposed to there's only one
person that can make the call.

1099
01:07:29,711 --> 01:07:34,150
That's just centralized
command. So again, it's very,

1100
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:39,280
it's hard for me to, to, to uh,
throw this out there, right?

1101
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:43,180
Cause I don't want an 18 year old
marine thinking whoa unified funnel.

1102
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:45,160
Like what the platoon commander says.
I'm just going to tell them no,

1103
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:49,810
that's not what I'm saying. Not what
I'm saying. I do want you to think,

1104
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,530
yeah, I do want you as an
18 year old marine to think,

1105
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:56,620
I want you to be understanding what
decisions being made to the best of your

1106
01:07:56,621 --> 01:07:57,940
ability.
And yes,

1107
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:02,110
if you see something happening that is
absolutely not good and you know it,

1108
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:03,220
you're damn right.

1109
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:06,160
You should speak up and your platoon
commanders should be happy that you're

1110
01:08:06,161 --> 01:08:06,994
speaking up.

1111
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,320
But if you're a guy that's going to
speak up every time a decision gets made

1112
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:13,030
because you think maybe
of a different way,

1113
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:14,800
that might be a little
bit better in your mind,

1114
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,460
you're going to suffer the
consequences of number one,

1115
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,740
the whole platoon being indecisive.
And number two,

1116
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:24,530
your boss going to tell you to shut up,
cause your,

1117
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:27,140
your idea that might be
8% better than his idea.

1118
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:29,030
We don't have time to
discuss that right now,

1119
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:32,300
so unless you see something
that's real significant, yeah,

1120
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:36,080
shut up and do what you're told. If you
see something that's really significant,

1121
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:39,110
okay. Hey, boss, negative.
Can't do that. There you go.

1122
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:40,300
Okay.

1123
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,280
The second factor,
discipline.

1124
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:48,330
The object of disciplines is
the conquest of fear press.

1125
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:53,760
This is new perspective for me that the
reason we have discipline is to conquer

1126
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:57,350
fear. It's interesting, right?

1127
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,610
Factually true to what is it that gets
you to do that thing that you're afraid

1128
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:03,530
of? You have the discipline
to just drive through it

1129
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:10,890
adequately to determine the best method
of doing this requires an analysis of

1130
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:13,960
fear to be made.
There are two aspects of fear.

1131
01:09:13,961 --> 01:09:16,690
Fear can suddenly attack a
man through his imagination.

1132
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:21,670
A corpse in a ditch or a grave by the
side of the road will remind him of the

1133
01:09:21,671 --> 01:09:23,170
peril of his position.

1134
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:26,740
He will suddenly realize that he
himself is liable to be killed.

1135
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:31,420
It is a function of discipline to fortify
the mine so that so that it becomes

1136
01:09:31,421 --> 01:09:36,421
reconciled to unpleasant sites and accepts
them as normal everyday occurrences.

1137
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,830
Fear can also creep in upon a man
during periods of monotony in the line.

1138
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,750
So this is the other type of
fear. There's two types, right?

1139
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:46,120
The one that just jumps on
you and the other one is,

1140
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:50,080
is creeps on you at such a time.

1141
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:53,800
He will have the opportunity to appreciate
the dangers which pacet his life.

1142
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:58,980
Fear acting through his thoughts can so
reduce a man's hard core of courage that

1143
01:10:00,671 --> 01:10:02,560
he will become nervous and fearful.

1144
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:07,020
Discipline strengthens the mind so that
it becomes impervious to the corroding

1145
01:10:07,021 --> 01:10:07,920
influence of fear.

1146
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:11,970
It teaches men to confine their
thoughts within certain definite limits.

1147
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:15,960
Kate instills the habit of self control.

1148
01:10:17,740 --> 01:10:20,950
Keep your emotions in check, keep your
fear and check that requires discipline.

1149
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:27,750
The basis of fear is the
awareness of danger in itself.

1150
01:10:27,751 --> 01:10:31,040
This is healthy
for a man who is aware of danger,

1151
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:33,680
automatically take steps
to provide against it.

1152
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:37,520
It is only when fear dominates the mind
that it becomes unhealthy and leads to

1153
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:40,940
panic. So fear is good. We
know that fear is healthy.

1154
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:44,510
We know that until you let it dominate
your mind and then it's a problem.

1155
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:49,160
Men must be urged to fight
fear with courage so that
they will advance or defend

1156
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:53,060
and not take refuge in fight
and flight or inaction.

1157
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:57,200
Man Becomes aware of when
man becomes aware of danger,

1158
01:10:57,201 --> 01:11:00,710
when he feels himself opposed to
something more powerful than himself.

1159
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:03,913
Right?

1160
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:09,020
Man Becomes aware of danger when he
feels himself opposed to something more

1161
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:11,630
powerful than himself.
In other words,

1162
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:16,631
when he feels that his own armor min is
unequal to that of the enemy who oppose

1163
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:17,573
him,

1164
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:22,710
it is important for a man to lose his
individual feeling and to become an

1165
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:26,670
integral part of the battalion,
division and army to which he belongs.

1166
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,810
The larger the unit of which he feels
himself to be a member of the larger will

1167
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:34,890
be the estimation of his own armament
and the less will be his fear.

1168
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:41,250
It is here that discipline shows its value
for it can help a man to lose his own

1169
01:11:41,821 --> 01:11:45,270
identity and become a part of a larger,
stronger unit.

1170
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,320
It is in this way that
discipline will conquer fear.

1171
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,390
Got to relate to that bigger group.

1172
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,980
You see this in like gang fights,

1173
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,340
the one person by themselves as a coward,

1174
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:05,430
but then when they have 10
of their friends, all of a
sudden they're courageous.

1175
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,380
It's a horrible example, but it's a
reality, right? It's a total reality.

1176
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:14,700
Yeah.
I used to see that in the streets,

1177
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:19,680
the street back in the day,
like, yeah. You know, like
one person, myself included,

1178
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:23,610
you know, your two or three of us. Okay,
we're a little bit, we got a little, uh,

1179
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:27,600
we got a little, a little froggy, right?

1180
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:32,580
But when there's 18 of us, all of a sudden
you're real tough, right? That's me.

1181
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:36,990
When I was 15 years old, oh, I'm super
tough with all my friends. Right?

1182
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:43,440
Bad. It's a bad example, but it's the
reality and I liked it. Big scraps.

1183
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:47,610
This corporate sense,
which discipline creates,

1184
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:51,480
helps men face the unknown.
At night.

1185
01:12:51,481 --> 01:12:53,490
Men in the line become
afraid of the unknown,

1186
01:12:53,491 --> 01:12:56,310
which stretches out in front
of them at all times in action.

1187
01:12:56,311 --> 01:12:59,580
They are afraid of new and terrifying
weapons which may be used against them.

1188
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,330
They realize that these unknown
quantities may bring danger to them.

1189
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:07,050
Their ability to face these dangerous
is immensely strengthened by feeling

1190
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,430
themselves to be part of a group.

1191
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,050
The group is known and a certain quantity
which they feel is strong enough to

1192
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:14,880
stand up to the unknown,

1193
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:18,390
dangerous with surround them in numbers.

1194
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:25,400
The method by which the conquest of fear
is achieved is the unifying of men into

1195
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:28,140
a group or unit under obedience to orders.

1196
01:13:28,141 --> 01:13:31,620
So he rolls right back to
obedience to orders. Monte does,

1197
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:36,030
and part of the reason is he's talking
about conscripts a lot. Draftees,

1198
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:39,780
not volunteers. So there's a
little bit of uh, that's what,

1199
01:13:39,781 --> 01:13:42,030
that's what he's dealing with now,

1200
01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:46,230
as we know from hack and from
General Mooka Yama like, Hey,

1201
01:13:46,231 --> 01:13:49,230
if you treat your people right,
doesn't matter that the draftees

1202
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:55,050
men required to be United if they are to
give of their best discipline seeks to

1203
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:59,400
instill into all ranks a sense of unity
by compelling them to obey orders as one

1204
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:00,030
man.

1205
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:04,950
This obedience to orders
is the indispensable
condition of good discipline.

1206
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:09,720
Men Learn to gain confidence and
encouragement from doing the same thing as

1207
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:13,420
their fellows. They drive and
satisfaction from their company,

1208
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:16,630
their own identities become
merged into the larger,

1209
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:20,440
stronger identity of the unit.
You know what's interesting is I'll go,

1210
01:14:20,441 --> 01:14:24,760
I'll even go a little bit more
hardcore against Monte. Uh,

1211
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:31,050
you know what to me is an exceptional
unit is the unit where you don't even have

1212
01:14:31,181 --> 01:14:33,910
to give orders where you just,

1213
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:37,720
where everyone knows what the intent is.
Or you give them a lay of looks like,

1214
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:37,901
hey,

1215
01:14:37,901 --> 01:14:42,040
this is the intent and people to do what
they're supposed to do with no orders.

1216
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:45,330
Yeah. That's what you really
want. You know, there's, uh,

1217
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:51,750
a chapter that Lafe wrote where he's
talking about prioritize and execute and

1218
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:57,250
he's talking about how it's when one
of our guys fell through the roof,

1219
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:59,770
they were on a mission.
They were an Overwatch.

1220
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:03,040
They ended up having to conquer a
sledge hammer through a concrete wall.

1221
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,420
And Lafe and I were talking about,

1222
01:15:04,421 --> 01:15:08,920
he's like writing the chapter and he
was going to talk about like what his

1223
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:13,150
priorities were and how he told the guys
like, you know you do this, you do this.

1224
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,580
And he's like, yeah, well the thing is
I didn't tell anyone to do anything.

1225
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:20,990
And I was like, yeah, check.
Cause his guys knew, oh wait,
we've got this going on,

1226
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:23,530
we're going to set security, we're going
to move like the, everyone knows what.

1227
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:27,880
That's what you want. And then what that
allowed life to do is I think about,

1228
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:30,340
okay now bigger priorities and
that's what he wrote about.

1229
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:34,390
But your troops,
they shouldn't,

1230
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:38,170
you shouldn't even have to give them
orders because they should be trained well

1231
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:43,171
enough to respond based on the situation
and knowing and understanding the

1232
01:15:43,901 --> 01:15:47,230
standard operating procedures and
knowing very quickly what it is that your

1233
01:15:47,231 --> 01:15:49,270
intent is as the leader.

1234
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:54,330
So all you need to say is set security
and the guys get into position where

1235
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:58,360
they're supposed to go. That's how
it should be. I'm not looking for,

1236
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,580
I'm not looking for obedience.
You know what I'm looking for.

1237
01:16:00,581 --> 01:16:05,380
I'm looking for what we used
to call thinking shooters.

1238
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:08,800
You know, I want a platoon
full of thinking shooters,

1239
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:12,580
meaning that they're thinking for
themselves, they're making things happen.

1240
01:16:12,970 --> 01:16:16,150
They understand what
it is that I want done,

1241
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:20,650
whether I said it to them or whether
we pre-brief did or whether we've been

1242
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:22,570
through this, we've
drilled it, but whatever.

1243
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:26,050
They know what it is that I want done
and I want my team to be thinking this is

1244
01:16:26,051 --> 01:16:30,990
decentralized command. When you get into
just wrote obedience, we're losing the,

1245
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:34,990
the aspect of decentralized command.
And as Monte said earlier,

1246
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:38,470
believe it or not,
believe it or not,

1247
01:16:38,471 --> 01:16:41,290
your man might be able to make some
decisions on their own. It's like, yes,

1248
01:16:41,291 --> 01:16:44,380
take that a lot, many, many
steps further than that

1249
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,460
chick
continuing on.

1250
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:55,960
Men must learn to obey orders
when all their instincts cry out.

1251
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:57,280
For them not to be obeyed.

1252
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:02,680
They must learn to obey orders in times
of stress so that they will do so in

1253
01:17:02,681 --> 01:17:06,490
times of danger. They must learn to carry
out their tasks under any condition.

1254
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:08,980
And despite all difficulties in this way,

1255
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:13,880
mass of loose individuals with their fears
and weaknesses can be welded together

1256
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:18,140
into a United whole ready to
act on the word of the leader.

1257
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,970
So again,

1258
01:17:19,971 --> 01:17:22,640
what I'm saying is I don't want them
ready to act on the word of the leader.

1259
01:17:22,641 --> 01:17:27,470
I want them ready to act
on the fault of the leader.

1260
01:17:30,330 --> 01:17:31,070
Yeah.

1261
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:36,050
Discipline helps men to display fortitude
in the face of fatigue and discomfort

1262
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,690
while at the same time it
helps them conquer fear.

1263
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:43,710
It enables them uncomplainingly to
triumph over difficulties which would have

1264
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:45,830
overcome them in times of peace.

1265
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:50,900
This constancy in enduring hardship and
fatigue is the quality which is most

1266
01:17:50,901 --> 01:17:52,970
frequently required of a soldier,

1267
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:57,560
individual fortitude and corporate courage
or the twin products of discipline.

1268
01:17:58,430 --> 01:17:59,540
So there we get.
That's the,

1269
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:04,100
that's the just straight positive aspects
of discipline that, that I think of,

1270
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:08,600
hey, things are going to be, we're gonna
be tired. Whatever, discomfort, whatever,

1271
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:12,440
fear, whatever. We have discipline,
discipline, cockers, all those things.

1272
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,870
Discipline implies a conception of duty.

1273
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:19,490
Nothing will be accomplished in the
crisis of by man without a sense of duty.

1274
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:25,280
The century in and outpost holds his
ground in the face of an attack because he

1275
01:18:25,281 --> 01:18:27,410
has a sense of duty to those behind him.

1276
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:32,650
This sense is instilled by discipline
because it teaches men to obey orders as a

1277
01:18:33,111 --> 01:18:34,460
matter of course,

1278
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:39,860
to know that it is wrong not to obey them
and right that it is their duty to do

1279
01:18:39,861 --> 01:18:42,820
so
for the soldier.

1280
01:18:42,970 --> 01:18:47,740
This conception of duty does not embrace
abstractions such as freedom or empire

1281
01:18:47,741 --> 01:18:49,450
or democracy in battle.

1282
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:53,650
A soldier's sense of duty extends only
to the friends who are around him and is

1283
01:18:53,651 --> 01:18:56,650
the job of the junior leader to
encourage this sense of duty.

1284
01:18:56,651 --> 01:18:59,590
Abstractions are the
sphere of a politician,

1285
01:18:59,591 --> 01:19:03,790
so he goes real extreme in this one
and we all have heard this before. Hey,

1286
01:19:03,791 --> 01:19:07,780
when you're in combat, you're not
fighting for this political ideology.

1287
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:10,870
You're fighting for the man to your
left and your right. Absolutely true,

1288
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,990
absolutely true. I would say, well,

1289
01:19:13,991 --> 01:19:18,991
I know that it's not just
that you have to you you at.

1290
01:19:20,910 --> 01:19:25,180
When, when the immediate battles
over, you need to look and say, okay,

1291
01:19:25,181 --> 01:19:28,210
well why are we doing this?
Oh, we're doing this because
we believe in our cause.

1292
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:34,240
So to me it's both. You can't just
cast out, you know, in my opinion,

1293
01:19:34,241 --> 01:19:36,640
abstractions are the
sphere of politicians.

1294
01:19:36,641 --> 01:19:38,530
No troops need to believe
in what they're doing.

1295
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,140
A certain type of training may induce
men to go forward in an attack simply out

1296
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:47,840
of fear of the consequences of not doing.
So.

1297
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:53,090
This applies only to the weakest and most
feeble of men who are of little value

1298
01:19:53,091 --> 01:19:55,700
in battle. This type of training
is an essential part of discipline,

1299
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:58,280
but it's never be misty to
be mistaken for the hole.

1300
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:02,360
So he kind of goes one way and
then the other it's like, yeah,

1301
01:20:02,361 --> 01:20:03,650
sometimes you're just going to have to,

1302
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,740
you have to make people do what you want
to do because they're afraid of you or

1303
01:20:07,741 --> 01:20:11,070
they're afraid of the consequences.
If you have to lead through fear,

1304
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,100
if you, if you, if you,

1305
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:18,150
if your team is doing
something only because they're
afraid of the consequences,

1306
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,030
that's a losing battle. Yell.
It's a losing the war, right?

1307
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:23,460
You might win the battle,
but you're not going to win the war.

1308
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:27,030
Continuing on the type of training
mentioned in the preceding paragraph,

1309
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:31,500
which implies a certain harshness
and hardness has its value.

1310
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:38,850
Material comforts are now so insidious
that there is some danger that this is

1311
01:20:40,390 --> 01:20:44,950
the old fashioned idea of disciplined
and it will be allowed to disappear.

1312
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,480
This must not happen.

1313
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,130
Soldiers will not win battles if
their training has not been hard.

1314
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:57,600
That's a little less than
for your entire life.

1315
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,620
Soldiers will not win battles if
their training has not been hard.

1316
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:06,270
The softening influences of civilian
life must be replaced by the exacting

1317
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:08,040
demands of military training.

1318
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:09,460
Yeah.

1319
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:14,260
Soldiers must forget the pleasures of
peace and concentrate on the realities of

1320
01:21:14,261 --> 01:21:15,490
war.
Isn't it funny that this,

1321
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,710
this could be written right now
and some of the WHO, you know,

1322
01:21:17,711 --> 01:21:20,730
training is getting easier and all that
and tech that we always think that got

1323
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:22,200
to keep it hard.
He always get,

1324
01:21:22,630 --> 01:21:25,450
always get to fight against the
slippery slope of things. Getting easier

1325
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:32,190
in brief discipline seeks to conquer
fear by welding men into a cohesive whole

1326
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:36,550
unit. United by obedience to orders. Yeah.

1327
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,340
Okay.

1328
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,110
No, I'm not with you. Money.

1329
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:44,190
It aims to create a body strong enough
to carry each of its members through

1330
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:48,240
dangers and difficulties which they
themselves would be unable to face alone.

1331
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:52,750
In this way, it promotes comradeship,
which is the third factor of morale. Okay?

1332
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:58,350
I much more important in my opinion
than the blind obedience of orders.

1333
01:21:58,351 --> 01:22:01,050
Morale,
so we're talking about comradeship now.

1334
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:06,051
Morale cannot be good and less men have
come unless men come to have affection

1335
01:22:07,091 --> 01:22:09,340
for each other.
A fellow feeling must grow up,

1336
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:14,341
which will result in a spirit
of comradeship and army
is made up of human beings

1337
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:19,390
so that however much at leader
may inspire as men, however,

1338
01:22:19,391 --> 01:22:23,110
perfect the discipline,
morale will be hard and unsympathetic.

1339
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:24,710
Okay?

1340
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:28,790
If the warmth of comradeship
is not added to it, war,

1341
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,310
the hard business is not
necessarily a grim one.

1342
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:35,720
Men Muscle Laugh and joke together must
enjoy each other's company and must get

1343
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:38,000
fun out of life even in times of danger.

1344
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:44,350
Check this spirit of comradeship must
begin at the section or tank crew level

1345
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:46,700
and work its way upward to army level.

1346
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:52,120
The importance of encouraging men to band
together and identify themselves with

1347
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:56,030
their units has already been emphasized.

1348
01:22:56,630 --> 01:23:01,630
This will be necessary to
make considerable efforts
to further this spirit of

1349
01:23:03,021 --> 01:23:03,854
comradeship.

1350
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:08,410
Junior commanders must plan to create
this spirit in the same way they plan to

1351
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:10,540
train their men and fire their weapons.

1352
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:14,980
Men must not be moved from unit to unit
or even from platoon to platoon unless

1353
01:23:14,981 --> 01:23:18,580
there's good reason for doing it and these
reasons must be made clear to the men.

1354
01:23:18,970 --> 01:23:22,360
A man who has served among friends in
the same platoon for a long time will be

1355
01:23:22,361 --> 01:23:26,320
helped by them to face the trials
a battle he will feel around him.

1356
01:23:26,350 --> 01:23:29,680
His reserves of courage and
purpose upon which he can draw.

1357
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:34,180
There will be a feeling of solidarity and
out of this feeling there were grow up,

1358
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:38,200
a determination to advance together and
defend together and even die together

1359
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:44,870
in wartime. With such heavy casualties
and constant reinforcements,

1360
01:23:44,871 --> 01:23:46,640
it is always found that comp,

1361
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:50,900
this comradeship can be built up most
quickly by ensuring that new arrivals as

1362
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:54,770
reinforcements belonged to the part of
Britain from which the unit is originally

1363
01:23:54,771 --> 01:23:59,530
drawn. And to which it belongs
in peacetime. So that's what, uh,

1364
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:03,590
you've got to have your team join
together. And then he's saying, look,

1365
01:24:03,591 --> 01:24:05,300
if you've got new
reinforcements coming in,

1366
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:08,860
and they came from Darbyshire and
there is a unit from Barbara shirts,

1367
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:10,670
sent them to go work with
the guys from Darbyshire.

1368
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:15,260
They already have a connection.
Comradeship is,

1369
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,800
and you know who didn't do that?
The Soviets,

1370
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:23,150
the Soviet Union was famous for not doing
that because they didn't want there to

1371
01:24:23,151 --> 01:24:26,990
be a really strong unity in the,

1372
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:31,280
in the forces because then
that unity might turn into,

1373
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:34,880
you know, a movement. So they
didn't want that. They would,

1374
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,250
they would notoriously split everyone up.

1375
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:39,950
You would never be with a guy
from your home town, you know,

1376
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:42,290
they'd split everyone up.
This is the opposite of that.

1377
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,350
Comradeship is based
on affection and trust,

1378
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:49,220
which between them produce an atmosphere
of mutual goodwill and feeling of

1379
01:24:49,221 --> 01:24:50,150
interdependence.

1380
01:24:50,270 --> 01:24:54,080
Men Learn to have faith in each other
and to depend on each other according to

1381
01:24:54,081 --> 01:24:57,950
the abilities of each in a tank
crew, gun team, or infantry section.

1382
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:02,570
Men do not work well together merely
because they are disciplined and well led.

1383
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,500
They do so because they trust each other
and because they are bound together by

1384
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:10,970
an affection which has never
expressed in words, but shown itself.

1385
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:16,280
Indeed's comradeship is a great antidote
to fear because it gives a man friends,

1386
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,950
a man must take friends.
A man must make friends in his platoon,

1387
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,620
friends whom he respects
and admires in battle.

1388
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:25,780
These friends will prevent
him from feeling lonely.

1389
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:30,130
A man alone is a man who will find it
hard to stand up to the dangers of the

1390
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:30,964
line.

1391
01:25:31,850 --> 01:25:36,790
A man alone is a man afraid if
he has to be. If he has friends,

1392
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:41,860
he will derive strength from their
presence and he will be anxious not to let

1393
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:43,180
them down in battle.

1394
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:48,860
You will seek to do his fair share of
all tasks which come to his crew or

1395
01:25:48,861 --> 01:25:53,330
section. He will feel ashamed if he cannot
assist his friends in their duties and

1396
01:25:53,331 --> 01:25:58,140
maintain his place with them.
In the line, all men have,

1397
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,750
uh, within them. A touch of, of streak,

1398
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:03,560
of generosity and unselfishness,

1399
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,720
a touch of nobility and these qualities
will be brought out in the attitude to

1400
01:26:08,721 --> 01:26:13,370
their friends. Friendship Causes Men's
to Gi causes men to give their best.

1401
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,940
So you know what,

1402
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:18,830
I guess we started talking about
this a little bit in the beginning.

1403
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,460
If you're not, if you don't
want to be a part of the team,

1404
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:29,200
you are going to miss this whole section
of what makes a unit to have high

1405
01:26:29,721 --> 01:26:30,554
morale.

1406
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:34,730
If we're not friends
that hurts our morale.

1407
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:38,570
So you know, they have these,
these things and the uh,

1408
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,560
the rangers do a really good job of it.
You can peer someone out,

1409
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:46,910
meaning we as peers can,

1410
01:26:47,210 --> 01:26:52,070
can look at someone that we don't like
or that doesn't want to be a part of the

1411
01:26:52,071 --> 01:26:56,210
team and we can get rid of them.
So it's called peering someone out.

1412
01:26:56,270 --> 01:27:00,650
We don't really the, there's not an
official system in the seal teams.

1413
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:04,220
Like you can do it, but it's like,
it's a little bit case by case.

1414
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,380
So in the in ranger school,

1415
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:09,890
and forgive me Rangers if I don't
get this a hundred percent right,

1416
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:12,980
but basically you have to rank your,
you have to rank everyone in your patrol.

1417
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:16,250
So you've got 20 guys in your patrol,
you ranked, this guy was number one,

1418
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:18,110
meaning performance wise,
this guy was number one,

1419
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:22,400
this guy was number 20 if you're number
20 like a multiple times in a row,

1420
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,800
three times zero or something,
they kick you out.

1421
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,220
So what we have to do is we have to
work together as a team and say, okay,

1422
01:27:28,221 --> 01:27:31,610
you know what? It's my turn to be the
last guy. So put me as number 20 okay.

1423
01:27:31,611 --> 01:27:34,490
Jocularity from to put you in 20 okay,
cool. Next time it's going to be echo.

1424
01:27:34,491 --> 01:27:36,320
Next time it's going to be built,
next time it's going to be Mike.

1425
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,090
So that way we all want to stay.

1426
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:41,690
What we have to do is we have to
coordinate work together to rank ourselves

1427
01:27:41,691 --> 01:27:42,524
accordingly.

1428
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:47,360
So it's real easy if none of us like
echo three lazy just to put echo at the

1429
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:51,740
bottom three patrols in a row and
you're gone in the basic seal training,

1430
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:55,610
we don't really have a system like that.
It takes a little bit more,

1431
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,730
you have to be a little bit more proactive
because it's not just an existing

1432
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:02,690
thing. Uh, we did have a,
my seal training class,

1433
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:07,430
we had one guy that we basically
peered out, like my officers,

1434
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,970
you know, got feedback from everyone
and said this guys shouldn't be here.

1435
01:28:11,330 --> 01:28:13,820
And they went up to the instructors
and the instructors got rid of him.

1436
01:28:14,180 --> 01:28:17,690
So it happens. But it doesn't
happen in a quite that official way.

1437
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:20,810
And the only reason it wasn't performance
and was like, Hey, this guy doesn't,

1438
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:22,280
for lack of a better word,

1439
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:25,790
and this doesn't sound real good in this
politically correct world that we live

1440
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:28,790
in now you get someone that
doesn't fit in. Yeah. Right.

1441
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:31,100
Like this guy just doesn't fit in.
Cool.

1442
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:34,400
We're going to get rid of him because we
don't want to have someone on the team

1443
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:38,450
that's not, that doesn't want to be
part of the team. Yeah. And believe me,

1444
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:41,450
this happens very seldom.
Like you've gotta be a real,

1445
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,500
you've got to fit in in a real bit,

1446
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:47,980
not fitting in a real big way to
stand out in a, with a crowd of seals.

1447
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:51,860
There's all kinds of different
guys. Yeah. So can I heard,

1448
01:28:53,090 --> 01:28:55,970
it seems like anyway
that you could do that.

1449
01:28:55,971 --> 01:28:58,910
Like in a roommate situation
it'd be less official.

1450
01:28:58,911 --> 01:29:02,220
Like you're talking about a system. What?
That it's sort official, like you said,

1451
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,790
hey, the ranger like, yeah, like
you say, Hey, let's just wait.

1452
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:09,270
What's the ranking based on, on the
ranger thing? Well, they're saying, hey,

1453
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:10,650
echo did a great job on this patrol.

1454
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:12,360
I rank it was in the number
one guy on this patrol.

1455
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:15,740
Jocko was number 16 so he's number 16 and,

1456
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:18,360
and bill was horrible
and he's number 20 right.

1457
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:21,510
You do that every patrol you go on.
So wait till it,

1458
01:29:21,511 --> 01:29:24,660
let's say that we weren't gonna
phase anybody out or pour or,

1459
01:29:24,730 --> 01:29:27,330
so they went out and what we would
do is we would just rotate. Hey, I'm,

1460
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:28,800
I'm the bottom guy this time. Okay. Echo.

1461
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:32,990
You wouldn't really perform at the bottom
necessarily. Oh, just on the record.

1462
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,450
You have to force rank everyone and so
you rank k we're just going to rotate

1463
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:40,440
who's the bottom one. So none of us get
it eliminated. Gotcha. And then, yeah,

1464
01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:44,790
yeah, it's weird. I thought what
you meant by peer someone out,

1465
01:29:44,791 --> 01:29:48,060
which kind of might even be the same
thing in a way where let's say you have

1466
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:52,090
three roommates are full of
say four roommates and they
were like, hey this guy,

1467
01:29:52,091 --> 01:29:55,830
he's not fitting in and he
snores or I don't know, whatever.

1468
01:29:56,190 --> 01:30:00,750
And you know how roommates we're friends
typically right when you room with

1469
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:01,500
someone.
Um,

1470
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:06,180
and then after a while you just sorta
like not invite that one friend all the

1471
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:08,730
time and sort of peer, I'm
out peer, I'm out like, yeah,

1472
01:30:08,731 --> 01:30:11,130
like just more than anything.
I mean in a nutshell.

1473
01:30:11,131 --> 01:30:14,280
Basically you just make his experience
with the group just a little less

1474
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:15,133
enjoyable.

1475
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:19,440
So he sorta on his own just sorts of phase
himself out and find some new friends.

1476
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:23,100
Yeah. You know, just slowly,
just naturally kind of thing
where you're just like,

1477
01:30:23,101 --> 01:30:27,690
hey bro, where peer and you
out. Don't tell him. I mean,

1478
01:30:27,691 --> 01:30:29,970
I guess you could break, you know
when you break up with your friend,

1479
01:30:29,971 --> 01:30:33,750
you ever had to do that? Where you going
to be late? I'm a dude. No, no, no.

1480
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:35,910
Not breaking up with Kitson expression.

1481
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:39,810
It's an expression like where you know
how you ever had a friend who's like,

1482
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,000
they want to be your friend
and everything, but man,

1483
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:45,660
being friends with this person has just
kind of too much every day you read that.

1484
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:46,171
First of all,

1485
01:30:46,171 --> 01:30:48,240
I don't have a lot of people that want
to be friends with me and I don't have a

1486
01:30:48,241 --> 01:30:52,950
lot of the long list anyways, so I really
haven't had that APP Bruh. It like,

1487
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:55,680
I dunno,
like if your friend,

1488
01:30:55,681 --> 01:30:59,340
every time you go somewhere with them
he gets in arguments with people or gets

1489
01:30:59,341 --> 01:31:01,800
in fights or, or like,
I don't know, you know,

1490
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:04,650
the kind of guy is he is just too much
token friend with and you've got to break

1491
01:31:04,651 --> 01:31:09,280
up with him or he just calls you
too much. Oh, neat. You know,

1492
01:31:09,281 --> 01:31:12,820
like that kind of friend anyway.
Sometimes you guys don't have a lot of,

1493
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,710
this is making me feel real lonely
over here. I don't have it does. Maybe.

1494
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:18,420
Maybe you're the one who that phased out.

1495
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,620
I got phased out across the
board over the past 47 years.

1496
01:31:23,460 --> 01:31:27,210
Phased out. Could be red.
You're too intense. You're
too intense with your point,

1497
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:29,830
Jocko. He's going to be all
fired up for this. Yeah,

1498
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:32,910
we can't drink around him because
that's weird how people think.

1499
01:31:32,911 --> 01:31:37,400
They can't drink around you.
Some people do,

1500
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:42,140
but no, no. I'm pretty mellow
about it. You know something.

1501
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:45,110
She tried to get peered out over
here a year or two later. Anybody.

1502
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:50,150
You're peered out. But there's some people
I think feel internally guilty. Right.

1503
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:54,440
So they don't want me around because they
know like, oh well, um, I want to get,

1504
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:58,620
I want to do horrible things
tonight to my body. Right.

1505
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:00,010
And if I have Jocko having to

1506
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:04,900
feel guilty about it. Yeah. Yeah. It
might be judged or that's what it is.

1507
01:32:04,901 --> 01:32:08,730
I think they think, oh, judging. Always
judging. It's funny cause I'm, I'm, I'm,

1508
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:11,630
I'm saying that sarcastically. I
kind of really don't care. Yeah.

1509
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,080
I don't think you've even
indicated that you cared,

1510
01:32:14,081 --> 01:32:17,980
like not even in a little bit. Yeah.
Little Way. It's funny. Yeah. And,

1511
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:20,560
and actually I think,
I don't like to indicate,

1512
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:24,130
because then the person might
tighten their track up a little bit,

1513
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:26,830
then they're going to be like tougher
to deal with on the maths of justice.

1514
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,180
The whole plans. I mean,
I'm bringing donuts Bro.

1515
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:36,070
Today I have some of these work out.
So yes,

1516
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:38,470
I think it's a good system that the,
that the rangers have it. And I'm,

1517
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:38,831
like I said,

1518
01:32:38,831 --> 01:32:43,390
we have an unofficial methodology and
certainly once you get it to a seal team,

1519
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,110
there's the same thing can happen.
Right.

1520
01:32:47,111 --> 01:32:52,111
You get a guy that just doesn't quote
unquote fit in and that's a real thing.

1521
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:55,900
And like I said,
it's a real broad spectrum.

1522
01:32:55,901 --> 01:33:00,880
Like there's very few people that I know
that I know or that I've saw got peered

1523
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,140
out.
I don't think I ever,

1524
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:05,770
I think we might appeared out one guy
in like my second or third platoon,

1525
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,700
we actually had a guy that was just like,
yeah, you really just don't belong here.

1526
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:12,970
And you know, the idea
was like, hey, we need to,

1527
01:33:12,971 --> 01:33:17,260
and what'll happen is the noodle probably
get some safety violations, which is,

1528
01:33:17,261 --> 01:33:19,580
by the way, what, what will,

1529
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:21,670
one of the reasons why a guy's
going to get paired out. Like, Hey,

1530
01:33:21,671 --> 01:33:25,000
this guy just doesn't, can't
keep it together in the
house. You know what I mean?

1531
01:33:25,030 --> 01:33:29,760
That's not good. We don't want them
here. So yeah, you don't want you,

1532
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:33,460
because I think it's because it's not
like anyone not like anyone that says,

1533
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:33,851
well you know,

1534
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:36,640
comradeship is a real important part of
morale and morale is very important on

1535
01:33:36,641 --> 01:33:39,890
the battlefield. We never said that,
but you feel it an opportunity.

1536
01:33:39,891 --> 01:33:44,020
You've got some guy that just doesn't
fit in. Yeah, I can see how that can be,

1537
01:33:44,021 --> 01:33:48,490
especially with you guys in
the teams where it matters.

1538
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:52,570
It matters like way more, you know?
It's not like you're, you know, at the,

1539
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:58,420
in my case as a mover, you're going
little cruise, you know, and it's like,

1540
01:33:58,421 --> 01:34:00,730
man, it's just way less
at stake, you know,

1541
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:05,680
being like a coat or a bit less
and stay a little bit different.

1542
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,960
But yeah. So it makes sense
man. It totally does. Yeah,

1543
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,510
it's end again.
I don't want people freaking out,

1544
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,940
but I will say this.
What was it?

1545
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:18,250
I was going to college when I was going
to college and I was out of the seal

1546
01:34:18,251 --> 01:34:22,750
teams for a little while and
this one of my professors was,

1547
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:27,130
you know, like, you know, it must be
so nice to just be going to college.

1548
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,560
And I'm like, no, it's hell. I want to go
back to the teams immediately right now,

1549
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:37,240
this minute, because in this professor's
mind, you know, she's thinking, oh gosh,

1550
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:42,040
think of how wonderful this must be ta
here and being educated and learning and

1551
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:47,020
expanding your brain and you don't have
to do all that hard military stuff with

1552
01:34:47,021 --> 01:34:51,790
guns. And meanwhile, I'm
literally the exact opposite.

1553
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:56,290
I don't want to do a knee thing at
college and I want to go back to the teams

1554
01:34:56,291 --> 01:35:00,530
immediately. And I said, no, I w I,

1555
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:04,160
if I could go back right now, I would
immediately give me an f and every class,

1556
01:35:04,161 --> 01:35:07,100
if they let me go back and still be
but still be in the teams, I'd do it.

1557
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:12,470
And she goes, why is it that you liked
so much about it? And I said, well,

1558
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:15,260
everyone kind of like me.
You know,

1559
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:18,860
you're hanging around with a bunch of
guys that are kind of like you. Not Exact,

1560
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:22,850
but like they have the same mindset.
They laugh at the same jokes. There's,

1561
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:27,110
they have the, you know, it's like
just a bunch of similar type of people,

1562
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,160
which of course that's who you
want to hang around with it.

1563
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:31,430
You want to hang around with a bunch of
people that are the opposite of you. Now.

1564
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:34,520
You're not hanging around with like,
hey this person's nothing.

1565
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:37,640
This person is different than me that,
oh, I don't want to hear their input. No,

1566
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:38,474
I actually,

1567
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:43,480
I like getting different people's input
but there's a nice kind of solid base of

1568
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:45,380
like,
Hey,

1569
01:35:45,380 --> 01:35:49,640
you're a team guy on the team guy and
we kind of have the same kind of just

1570
01:35:49,641 --> 01:35:53,420
broad life perspective and that's nice
to have and it doesn't really matter

1571
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:55,670
where you came from because in the teams
you get all kinds of people from all

1572
01:35:55,671 --> 01:35:58,820
kinds of different backgrounds,
right? You get guys from Hawaii,

1573
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:03,500
you get guys from the, from the
ghetto, you get guys from the farm,

1574
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:06,620
you get guys from the city,
you get guys for you guys from everywhere.

1575
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:12,350
And yet all those differences
are like surface differences.

1576
01:36:12,530 --> 01:36:16,730
But the core dude, it's pretty much
like this dude. You know what I mean?

1577
01:36:16,731 --> 01:36:20,810
Like we're all pretty similar.
It doesn't matter what, you know,

1578
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:25,610
kind of how you grew up or what race you
are or what religion you are. It's like,

1579
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:29,010
oh yeah, disfigured. He's a team guy.
So we, we kind of get it. I kinda,

1580
01:36:29,100 --> 01:36:31,610
I know what you're thinking
and you know what I'm thinking.

1581
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,920
And that's kind of cool to be around.

1582
01:36:33,950 --> 01:36:38,090
And that is part of comradeship and
that is part of what makes a unit tight.

1583
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:43,400
And when there's an person that doesn't,
then that's,

1584
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:44,990
that's problematic and
it's not just problematic.

1585
01:36:44,991 --> 01:36:48,770
It's problematic for the
team starts to hurt morale.

1586
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,580
Yeah. It's weird. Not Weird,

1587
01:36:50,581 --> 01:36:54,000
but in football it's the same thing
but it's not the whole team though.

1588
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:57,930
People gather in positions like
the wide receiver, in my case,

1589
01:36:57,931 --> 01:37:00,870
all the wide receivers, same deal.
They all come from different places.

1590
01:37:00,871 --> 01:37:02,970
Hawaii guys, mainland guys,
different part, you know,

1591
01:37:02,971 --> 01:37:06,660
just saw such different people.
But for some reason there are,

1592
01:37:06,690 --> 01:37:08,760
they all just sort of
gravitate towards each other.

1593
01:37:08,761 --> 01:37:11,070
You know when you go to the
cafeteria or wherever you go,

1594
01:37:11,071 --> 01:37:14,190
like in football camp you see,

1595
01:37:14,730 --> 01:37:18,480
you can tell a lot by where people sit
there on the Caterpillar's. Yay. Yeah,

1596
01:37:18,510 --> 01:37:19,081
the quarterbacks.

1597
01:37:19,081 --> 01:37:23,910
I'll sit over there behind benders and
it's so interesting given this concept

1598
01:37:23,911 --> 01:37:27,990
that you're talking about where you
would think most of the people from a

1599
01:37:27,991 --> 01:37:28,824
certain area,

1600
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:33,180
maybe a certain race would gather together
and there is some of that for sure.

1601
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:37,380
But for the most part it's, it's
sorts of sorts itself out by position.

1602
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:40,920
It's like you see sort of the linemen and
kind of go over there and you know the

1603
01:37:40,921 --> 01:37:43,770
receivers are kind of like over here.
Yeah.

1604
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:47,920
And it doesn't matter like w there
where they come from or their little

1605
01:37:47,980 --> 01:37:51,870
background or whatever because there's
this underlying interest that they all

1606
01:37:51,871 --> 01:37:52,704
sort of share

1607
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:57,570
know core,
like a core part of their personality.

1608
01:37:57,571 --> 01:38:00,240
That's the same and that's
I guess the key thing here.

1609
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:05,500
Get that core part of your personality
that's the same and some fundamental

1610
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:09,900
characteristics of the good team guy. You
know, like there's a fundamental like,

1611
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:11,400
hey, this guy is going to work hard. Hey,

1612
01:38:11,401 --> 01:38:14,150
this guy's going to take care of his gear,
is going to take care of the platoon.

1613
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,320
Gary's going to knock it out,
not looking out for himself.

1614
01:38:16,321 --> 01:38:19,740
That's it's like a real,
the real problem.

1615
01:38:20,040 --> 01:38:24,960
Like if you're a yeah, you don't want to
be that guy. And so if you have those,

1616
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,470
you know, then it doesn't
really matter what you're like.

1617
01:38:27,550 --> 01:38:31,830
Whatever you layer on top of that,
it's fine, it's fine. No one cares,

1618
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:37,170
no one cares. Check. Next section.

1619
01:38:37,171 --> 01:38:39,390
The fourth factor is self respect.

1620
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:45,210
No Man can be said to possess high
morale if the quality of self respect is

1621
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:49,110
lacking, soldiers must be encouraged to
respect themselves at all times under all

1622
01:38:49,111 --> 01:38:49,944
conditions.

1623
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:54,540
This quality is involved with those of
discipline and comradeship to such an

1624
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:58,740
extent that it is perhaps wrong and
certainly difficult to separate them,

1625
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:04,850
but no man will have high morale who
does not possess a greater quality,

1626
01:39:05,881 --> 01:39:08,520
greater and wider than
comradeship and discipline.

1627
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:14,460
Self respect implies a determination to
maintain personal standards of behavior.

1628
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:20,270
A man who respects himself will neither
allow himself to become slovenly nor his

1629
01:39:21,301 --> 01:39:26,140
quarters dirty, right? This is this,

1630
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:30,600
this is the root of, you
know, the stereotypical,

1631
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:34,920
uh,
adult saying to the kid,

1632
01:39:34,940 --> 01:39:38,820
don't you have any self perspective? How
could you walk around looking like that?

1633
01:39:38,821 --> 01:39:42,360
How could you wear that? How could you
grow your hair like that? How could you,

1634
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:46,500
you know, like all those things, how
could you live in this pig sty, right?

1635
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,780
It's all those things
boil down to self respect.

1636
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:52,651
Even in action,

1637
01:39:52,651 --> 01:39:56,280
he will take care to see that his
personal appearance suffers as little as

1638
01:39:56,281 --> 01:40:00,360
possible. Montes, a bit
of a friction eastern,

1639
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:05,220
I think representing that baret
that's Monte.

1640
01:40:05,820 --> 01:40:10,170
It is the job of the NCO to
maintain this aspect of discipline.

1641
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:16,560
It is the function of the officer to
encourage and instill self respect.

1642
01:40:16,561 --> 01:40:18,840
So once again, who's, who's
instilling self respect?

1643
01:40:18,841 --> 01:40:21,140
It's the leaders and how do they do that?

1644
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:22,530
So the little things that
we just talked about,

1645
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:27,960
I believe you instill self respect by
doing things you just talked about,

1646
01:40:27,961 --> 01:40:32,070
which is giving people responsibility,
letting them figure out jobs themselves,

1647
01:40:32,071 --> 01:40:35,550
letting them do things.
Here's how Monte wants to do it.

1648
01:40:35,551 --> 01:40:39,000
The officer must've ruthlessly insist
on maintenance of personal standards.

1649
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:45,000
And then he says this, this is why you
gotta. You know, Montes coming off hard,

1650
01:40:45,001 --> 01:40:47,220
but here we go. At the same time, however,

1651
01:40:47,221 --> 01:40:50,400
he must let his men understand that
he appreciates and respects them.

1652
01:40:50,401 --> 01:40:51,234
As human beings,

1653
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,700
soldiers must be treated with
humanity and controlled by discipline.

1654
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,600
So there's a, there's a balance in
his dichotomy here, right treat,

1655
01:40:58,601 --> 01:41:01,330
treat them good, but controlling
by discipline, but treat them good.

1656
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:04,720
So he's got a dichotomy here.
If the officer does this,

1657
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,840
he will gain the respect of his
mandarin at the same time he gives them

1658
01:41:07,841 --> 01:41:12,010
self-respect. Efficiency is
inseparable from self respect.

1659
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,370
The sense of a good job,
well done, have a hard task.

1660
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:17,890
Assessed with the accomplished
is indispensable to good morale.

1661
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:21,730
Men must take pride in their ability
to carry out all jobs allotted to them.

1662
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:26,380
They must feel that they are good soldiers
and therefore a value to other people.

1663
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:31,930
That's a good little, good little
thing to sprinkle in. Especially kids,

1664
01:41:31,931 --> 01:41:36,820
right? Yeah. Like making you ever
been around kids that have been told,

1665
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:39,280
you know, that they're worthless
their whole lives. Like that's not,

1666
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:43,250
it's a horrible sight. And what do they
not have? They don't have self respect.

1667
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:48,070
Men can be persuaded of
this fact by being trusted.

1668
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,130
A man who feels he is trusted,

1669
01:41:53,131 --> 01:41:56,660
will feel that he's efficient and will
you will at once begin to respect myself.

1670
01:41:56,670 --> 01:42:01,110
This is like critical
leaders. I mean subordinates,

1671
01:42:01,140 --> 01:42:04,920
kids, either one. When you
start giving them that trust,

1672
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:08,400
like your daughter's not old enough, but
eventually you're gonna be saying, Hey,

1673
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:09,661
you're gonna stay at home.

1674
01:42:09,661 --> 01:42:12,570
I'm gonna be gone for about a half
an hour going to the store. Right.

1675
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:15,480
And she's going to like
stand up a little straighter.

1676
01:42:16,140 --> 01:42:19,360
Cause it's like all of a sudden that's a
big deal. Right? That's a big deal. Yeah.

1677
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:23,640
And that same thing happens with
your subordinates. Hey listen,

1678
01:42:23,641 --> 01:42:27,420
I'm going to be gone for a little bit.
Hold down the fort. Yeah, you got this,

1679
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,300
they stand up a little bit straighter.

1680
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:33,960
Their self respect increases
when you give them trust.

1681
01:42:36,870 --> 01:42:37,703
Yeah.

1682
01:42:37,730 --> 01:42:39,070
A man who feels he's trusted,

1683
01:42:39,230 --> 01:42:44,230
a man who feel he's in trusted will
feel that he is efficient and he will at

1684
01:42:44,541 --> 01:42:46,100
once begin to respect himself.

1685
01:42:46,101 --> 01:42:49,910
He will have confidence in his own
ability to fight men who are trusted,

1686
01:42:49,911 --> 01:42:51,110
gain self confidence.

1687
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:54,500
It is the job of the officer to
convince his men that he trusts them.

1688
01:42:54,680 --> 01:42:57,650
So once again, it's a leadership
scenario, but it's so true.

1689
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:02,450
Oh, I remember learning to drive
my dad. That's a big one. Oh yeah.

1690
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:05,310
So He um,
he first he taught,

1691
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:07,830
we learned on a manual transmission.
Yeah.

1692
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:11,450
Are there any manual transmission
studies? Hardly. Huh. Um,

1693
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:16,950
and it was a truck too, which is, it's
just harder. I mean, in my experience,

1694
01:43:16,951 --> 01:43:19,660
the one that we learned on,
it wasn't that easy to do yet.

1695
01:43:20,090 --> 01:43:22,170
And so we learned how to just do it,
you know,

1696
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:26,160
just use the manual transmission
for a second, third, fourth and um,

1697
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:29,570
but still not necessarily
driving like on the streets.

1698
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:33,290
So the first time he told me to drive,
like on the streets,

1699
01:43:33,291 --> 01:43:37,010
I knew how to do the shift and all that.
He just jumped in the um,

1700
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:37,800
okay,

1701
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,610
passenger seat and he put, you
know, put me any suggested,

1702
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:43,560
take us there and we're going to, you
know, where the store or whatever.

1703
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:46,950
And he was just like, take us there.
It wasn't the kind of like, okay,

1704
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:50,470
now what you want to do is do you
know, he, well it was nothing. It was,

1705
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,150
he just said straight up take us there.
And I felt that,

1706
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:57,530
I felt that like drives are now,
you know, and uh, Wayne and yeah,

1707
01:43:57,531 --> 01:43:58,520
a little bit nerve wracking,

1708
01:43:58,521 --> 01:44:01,760
but men way more confident than I would
done being if you would've been like,

1709
01:44:01,761 --> 01:44:05,090
okay, be sure to check your mail, check
your mirrors. Okay. Easy. You know,

1710
01:44:05,091 --> 01:44:06,920
like that kind of stuff.
None of that. He just said,

1711
01:44:06,970 --> 01:44:11,680
take us there. Yep. Boom. I took
us there. It was good. I liked it.

1712
01:44:11,681 --> 01:44:13,820
You know, dropping knowledge. Then

1713
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:20,650
check self-respect as a quality which
will develop inevitably if the three

1714
01:44:20,651 --> 01:44:23,560
essential factors already
considered our presence.

1715
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:27,880
It is true to say that without self
respect, good morale is impossible,

1716
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:32,260
is equally true. To say that
if the standards of leadership,

1717
01:44:32,261 --> 01:44:34,150
discipline and comradeship are high,

1718
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:36,640
the quality of self
respect will also be high.

1719
01:44:40,190 --> 01:44:43,880
So this all boils down to leadership.
Additional factor,

1720
01:44:43,940 --> 01:44:45,440
devotion to a cause.

1721
01:44:46,170 --> 01:44:49,880
It is impossible to make a d is
impossible to make devotion to a cause,

1722
01:44:49,881 --> 01:44:53,210
either a basic or contributory
factor to good morale.

1723
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:56,810
It must stand by itself
between these two categories.

1724
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:00,950
It is important to clear the mind of
some misconceptions connected with the

1725
01:45:00,951 --> 01:45:04,460
influence of a cause in shaping morale.

1726
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,370
Men do not fight primarily for a cause.

1727
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:09,760
They do not have,

1728
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:14,910
they do not advance over dangerous ground
in pursuit of an ideal they not now

1729
01:45:14,950 --> 01:45:18,820
fight as crusaders may have done long ago.

1730
01:45:19,060 --> 01:45:21,340
They fight because they
are ordered to do so.

1731
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:25,870
And they do it well or badly according
to the strength of various factors which

1732
01:45:25,871 --> 01:45:30,430
have already been considered. So yeah,

1733
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:33,160
this is one that I'm,
again, I'm not really,

1734
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:36,010
I'm not really down to down
with Monte on this thing.

1735
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:38,600
I think if you've got troops that are new,

1736
01:45:38,620 --> 01:45:41,080
have no idea why they're fighting
and they're not fighting for a cause,

1737
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:42,010
you're going to have a breakdown.

1738
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:46,690
You know you're gonna have a breakdown
in your units. As a matter of fact,

1739
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:51,010
he kinda said that. He said it
earlier, he said if you don't have,

1740
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:51,971
remember this,

1741
01:45:51,971 --> 01:45:56,920
if you don't have respect for the plan
and this and the higher leadership,

1742
01:45:57,280 --> 01:46:01,690
well that's what it causes is it
causes like we have a plan, we have,

1743
01:46:01,780 --> 01:46:04,630
we are higher leadership. Who's that?
That's the leaders of our country.

1744
01:46:04,990 --> 01:46:07,420
That's the highest leadership.
So if you don't,

1745
01:46:07,870 --> 01:46:10,210
if you don't believe in that then
you're going to have a problem.

1746
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,420
And then he says this and this again,

1747
01:46:13,421 --> 01:46:16,780
this is a little arrogance
coming from coming from Monte.

1748
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,120
This is not so in the case of leaders,

1749
01:46:19,780 --> 01:46:22,630
some men fight some fight for
the same reason as the men,

1750
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:28,060
the more intelligent because they have
cause they add heart believe in what they

1751
01:46:28,061 --> 01:46:32,030
fight for. Such leaders are using
the best in the army and wheel.

1752
01:46:32,031 --> 01:46:36,640
The greatest influence thus numerically
cause is of little importance.

1753
01:46:36,641 --> 01:46:41,140
But it is a powerful factor because the
leaders are greatly influenced by it.

1754
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:42,430
So he's basically
saying, listen, you know,

1755
01:46:42,431 --> 01:46:45,220
the senior leaders have an
understanding of the cause,

1756
01:46:45,221 --> 01:46:47,320
and so whereas the men are just
fighting because they're ordered.

1757
01:46:47,321 --> 01:46:50,930
So he literally says that I had, come
on Bro, that's not, that's, that's,

1758
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,380
that doesn't work. That doesn't work in
America. And you know, you talk like,

1759
01:46:55,381 --> 01:46:57,270
look at that,
that letter I read from the beginning.

1760
01:46:57,271 --> 01:47:00,510
That's kind of why I wanted
to read that letter as a con,

1761
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:04,320
as a contradiction to
this. And as an, I mean,

1762
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:07,260
what he says in that letter is like,
look,

1763
01:47:07,261 --> 01:47:09,300
I'm not fighting for the great of England.
He says that,

1764
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:13,680
but he's fighting for the cause that
causes security for his family. Right.

1765
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:17,580
So people aren't thinking about
that. You don't, you don't,

1766
01:47:17,610 --> 01:47:20,040
you don't say,

1767
01:47:20,041 --> 01:47:24,690
I'm willing to die just because some
random dude ordered me to do it. No.

1768
01:47:24,720 --> 01:47:29,600
You have to have a connection to something
greater than that. Otherwise you're,

1769
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,480
you're suicidal, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1770
01:47:32,490 --> 01:47:36,420
I remember saving private Ryan when
he said that he, there's a movie. Yes,

1771
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:40,480
he threw Tom Hanks. Right.
He, uh, he was like,

1772
01:47:40,690 --> 01:47:45,400
I don't know who Ryan, you know, they got
to save private. Right. Obviously. And um,

1773
01:47:46,270 --> 01:47:51,080
there at this part where they're kind
of questioning things, you know, guys,

1774
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:55,810
morale is breaking down and you know,
things happen.

1775
01:47:55,811 --> 01:47:58,600
And what he says in part of
his speech was like, Hey,

1776
01:47:58,601 --> 01:48:00,550
I don't know who private Ryan is.
I don't know him.

1777
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,320
So I basically questioning that
particular cause. But he said,

1778
01:48:05,321 --> 01:48:09,880
but if going and rescuing him earns
me the right to get back to my family,

1779
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:14,200
then that's my mission. So same deal,
same deal as the letter rates that he has.

1780
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:17,800
He had his caught soy. Yeah. And that
was the one who was fighting for,

1781
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:22,470
yeah, back to the book. Nevertheless,

1782
01:48:22,471 --> 01:48:25,740
nothing which has been stated here
must be interpreted as minimizing the

1783
01:48:25,741 --> 01:48:29,610
influence of cause on those officers and
men who are moved by it. So then he, he,

1784
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,960
he brings it back a little bit for these
few cause we'll be a sustaining and

1785
01:48:33,961 --> 01:48:37,500
strengthening factor in maybe of greater
importance to them than any of the

1786
01:48:37,501 --> 01:48:38,670
other four factors.

1787
01:48:39,090 --> 01:48:42,390
There are times when a few men will
be gripped by a cause and will perform

1788
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:44,820
astonishing deeds of
heroism to further it.

1789
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:49,200
Such men do not require the ordinary
bonds of discipline which unite and

1790
01:48:49,201 --> 01:48:53,700
strength and others, their devotion to
the cause is in itself all sufficient.

1791
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:57,360
Nor do they require the same kind
of leader that has been described.

1792
01:48:57,361 --> 01:48:59,790
They themselves will all be leaders.

1793
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:05,420
Such men may be properly described as
guerrilla or irregular for fighters

1794
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:09,330
fanatically devoted to a political,
religious or national ideal.

1795
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:14,690
They must not be confused with conscript
soldiers to whom this paper applies.

1796
01:49:16,620 --> 01:49:21,270
So there you go. I mean in America, if
you know we have all volunteer. Yeah,

1797
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:25,270
but I'm telling you even it
doesn't matter if you've got it,

1798
01:49:25,271 --> 01:49:28,260
you've people have to understand there
has to be some kind of a deeper causes to

1799
01:49:28,261 --> 01:49:30,840
what you're doing or else you're
going to have real problems. Sure.

1800
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:33,810
You can order people if they're constructs
and you can punish them if they don't

1801
01:49:33,811 --> 01:49:36,150
do what you're going to tell.
If they don't do what you tell them to do,

1802
01:49:36,151 --> 01:49:39,480
you can punish them.
That is a way,

1803
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:43,530
but that is not going to be
a successful way. You know?

1804
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:47,590
That is not going to be the ideal way.
And by way,

1805
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:51,910
if you're not using the ideal way,
you may win.

1806
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:54,580
But if you're going against somebody
that is using the ideal way,

1807
01:49:54,581 --> 01:49:57,910
that has a cause that they
believe in and on top of that,

1808
01:49:57,911 --> 01:50:00,310
because they have all these
other things, the the, the,

1809
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,370
the group that has a real cause
will win every single time.

1810
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:11,080
Now there's some other contributory
factors that he brings up here.

1811
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:15,730
One is success. This is a real
obvious one. Success, high morale is,

1812
01:50:16,090 --> 01:50:20,230
is possible in defeat, but not during a
long period of defeat. On such occasions,

1813
01:50:20,231 --> 01:50:22,540
confidence in leaders will never be Wayne.

1814
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:26,980
And the first basis will be undermined
to success will aid good morale by

1815
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:30,070
creating confidence in the
leader and the in the command.

1816
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:34,670
This factor requires no enlargement.
Uh,

1817
01:50:34,780 --> 01:50:37,030
next one is regimental tradition.

1818
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:41,200
Regimental Spirit can be a powerful
factor in making for a good morale.

1819
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:44,980
The more a soldier feels himself
to be identified with his regiment,

1820
01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:46,900
the higher will be his morale.

1821
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:50,980
If the four essential conditions have
been fulfilled, it must be realized.

1822
01:50:50,981 --> 01:50:51,814
However,

1823
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:56,820
that not only that there can be a
good morale without strong regimental

1824
01:50:56,921 --> 01:50:57,670
feelings,

1825
01:50:57,670 --> 01:51:02,670
but that regiments with a great tradition
do not necessarily always produce good

1826
01:51:03,220 --> 01:51:07,310
battalions.
So the the tradition,

1827
01:51:07,311 --> 01:51:12,311
which there's some units that have
awesome traditions and you know,

1828
01:51:12,781 --> 01:51:16,640
we'll being with some of those,
some of those units overseas,

1829
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:20,990
I mean the first of the five
oh six obviously comes to,
comes to light and their,

1830
01:51:22,740 --> 01:51:23,720
their tradition,

1831
01:51:23,810 --> 01:51:28,810
the hundred and first airborne tradition
was so thick there that pride was in

1832
01:51:29,031 --> 01:51:31,850
every soldier that, that war, that,

1833
01:51:32,690 --> 01:51:37,190
that ace of spades at that spade
on their gear. I was like, yeah,

1834
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,660
there's pride there.
There's tradition,

1835
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:42,890
but he's saying it's not going
to replace these other things,

1836
01:51:42,891 --> 01:51:47,030
but it is a factor that
you can use another factor.

1837
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:53,090
Again, contributory
factor, personal happiness.

1838
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:59,170
A man should be happy in the sense that
his personal life should be in order.

1839
01:52:00,580 --> 01:52:04,490
Nothing weakens a man more than
trouble at home. It encouraging,

1840
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:07,480
it encourages him to think
of home and all that.

1841
01:52:07,481 --> 01:52:10,480
It implies when he should
be occupied with the enemy.

1842
01:52:11,050 --> 01:52:15,220
It turns his mind to peace and his
desire to live at the moment when it is

1843
01:52:15,221 --> 01:52:19,060
necessary for him to steel himself
to face the possibility of death.

1844
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:22,750
He must never be allowed to forget
that it is his job to fight.

1845
01:52:23,140 --> 01:52:26,170
The function is to kill
the enemy and in doing so,

1846
01:52:26,171 --> 01:52:27,850
he must expose himself to danger.

1847
01:52:29,090 --> 01:52:34,090
Anything which weakens his will to fight
and expose himself must be considered

1848
01:52:34,131 --> 01:52:38,270
to lower his morale.
A soldier is only a family man.

1849
01:52:38,271 --> 01:52:39,800
After he is a soldier,

1850
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:44,330
he must look forward at the
enemy and not back towards home.

1851
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:51,900
Hmm. Some realism to that. Definitely.

1852
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:54,960
I think it can go either way.

1853
01:52:55,140 --> 01:53:00,140
I think there's times where people can
be driven to success by their family back

1854
01:53:01,951 --> 01:53:03,690
home. Maybe by thinking of
their family with just kidding.

1855
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:06,840
You can definitely become a
distraction depending on the situation.

1856
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:09,290
Yeah. It seems like when
there's a lot of risk involved,

1857
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,540
it'll be a district is a distraction

1858
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:14,783
maybe.

1859
01:53:15,810 --> 01:53:18,450
I think it depends on the individual.
I think it depends on the circumstances.

1860
01:53:19,930 --> 01:53:21,970
I think what may be

1861
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:23,830
better to look,
whether it's a distraction,

1862
01:53:23,831 --> 01:53:26,470
not as is like what's going on at home.
That's what's more important.

1863
01:53:26,680 --> 01:53:30,490
If there's disruption at
home, that's a problem, right?

1864
01:53:30,730 --> 01:53:35,080
If you've got a guy that's overseas and
is, there's problems in the family life,

1865
01:53:35,370 --> 01:53:37,000
that's, that's wrong,
that's going to hurt.

1866
01:53:37,150 --> 01:53:40,630
Yeah. Yeah. It's weird
cause like at w, you know,

1867
01:53:40,631 --> 01:53:45,250
guys at work sometimes
anyway, sometimes, um,

1868
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,700
you know, they, it's something
bad can be going on at home.

1869
01:53:48,750 --> 01:53:52,600
Then they'll use work to sort of cover
it up, like playing in their mind.

1870
01:53:52,601 --> 01:53:57,490
You know, there'll be like, hey, that like
again, sorry for another movie reference,

1871
01:53:57,491 --> 01:54:00,730
but there's a movie called true lies.
Arnold Schwarzenegger. I've seen those.

1872
01:54:00,970 --> 01:54:04,600
He goes, yeah, so Arnold, I
haven't seen it enough times.

1873
01:54:04,601 --> 01:54:08,830
It came out 20 years ago to be
pulling our quote storyline, but hey,

1874
01:54:08,831 --> 01:54:12,380
let's go with it. It's kind of beside
the point of this one. But he goes, uh,

1875
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:14,740
you know,
Arnold finds out that his wife is,

1876
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:16,870
or thinks that his wife
cheating on him with it.

1877
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:21,310
And then the the partner Tom
Arnold, he goes, he's all,

1878
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:24,760
let's just focus on work. That's what
our, that's what I always do with my life.

1879
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:28,180
Turns to dog shit. I just focus
on work. Well but, and the,

1880
01:54:28,620 --> 01:54:32,410
the point is like some people that tell
you know something's going wrong at home,

1881
01:54:32,411 --> 01:54:34,390
they'll be like, you know what? I'm
just focusing on work. Screw that.

1882
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:37,350
That's forget about it. You know,
I'm an immerse myself. A nice team.

1883
01:54:37,351 --> 01:54:38,900
Can control work.
Yeah.

1884
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:42,010
Might not be able to control
your relationship that
where you think you should

1885
01:54:42,011 --> 01:54:43,750
be able to. Yeah. So

1886
01:54:45,250 --> 01:54:49,420
continuing on all soldiers do not
have morale effected by home troubles.

1887
01:54:49,930 --> 01:54:53,710
Some men thrive on on happiness and
fight all the more fiercely because they

1888
01:54:53,711 --> 01:54:58,090
hold a bitter, a secret bitterness
within them. Such men are the minority.

1889
01:54:58,091 --> 01:55:00,120
That's the person that you
just talked about, right. Hey,

1890
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:03,850
I'm just going to go work harder.
But as such, men under the minority,

1891
01:55:03,851 --> 01:55:05,200
but they are a large minority.

1892
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:09,730
They are reminder that happiness
cannot by itself produce good morale.

1893
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:11,080
Yeah.

1894
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,150
Next is administration of man's ordinary.

1895
01:55:13,151 --> 01:55:15,370
Day to day life must be
well organized with us.

1896
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:20,290
Hard conditions imposed on
him and training to inculcate
discipline do not rule

1897
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:25,291
out the desirability of
good living quarters and in
the line a soldiers' morale

1898
01:55:25,811 --> 01:55:30,610
will be much improved if the
administration administrative
arrangements are good

1899
01:55:30,850 --> 01:55:35,440
and if he is assured of proper conditions
with a reasonable amount of leisure

1900
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:39,440
and comfort when he leaves
the Front Leisure Day,

1901
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,920
where you at?
You at the avant

1902
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:48,330
and then he says this,
but hear a warning must be given.

1903
01:55:49,620 --> 01:55:54,620
There is a danger today of welfare being
considered as an end in itself and not

1904
01:55:56,401 --> 01:56:00,870
as a means to an end.
One of the means of maintaining morale.

1905
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:06,020
Welfare by itself will not produce good
morale because it is essentially soft

1906
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,210
and it has already been stated that
morale cannot be good unless it contains a

1907
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:17,190
quality of hardness. Man,
you got to remember that,

1908
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:22,080
right? You got to remember that you're
not ever going to have good morale unless

1909
01:56:22,081 --> 01:56:25,260
there's like an element of harkness to it

1910
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:32,630
and continuing on hardship and privation
are the school of the good soldier.

1911
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:38,610
Idleness and luxury are his enemies.

1912
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:44,580
Men will endure great hardships if
they know why and are convinced of the

1913
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:48,930
necessity. Blood, toil, tears
and sweat is not for nothing.

1914
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:54,500
One of the great rallying calls of the
English race Goring's cry guns before

1915
01:56:55,051 --> 01:56:58,920
butter expressed the same truth.
If men believe in the need,

1916
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:03,810
hardships are in themselves,
stimulant to morale,

1917
01:57:03,990 --> 01:57:05,670
but the opposite is also true.

1918
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:10,350
Let there be any suggestion that butter
can come before guns and the men will at

1919
01:57:10,351 --> 01:57:13,380
once choose butter.
If this happens,

1920
01:57:13,381 --> 01:57:16,410
there will be no morale in
this sense of the definition.

1921
01:57:18,520 --> 01:57:19,720
Then we get propaganda.

1922
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:24,840
The uplifting effect of modern
propaganda on a soldier is perhaps a new

1923
01:57:25,091 --> 01:57:27,160
development or Moran's.

1924
01:57:27,161 --> 01:57:32,140
Morale is raised immensely by the feeling
that his efforts are appreciated and

1925
01:57:32,141 --> 01:57:35,860
applauded not only by his
comrades and his officers,

1926
01:57:35,861 --> 01:57:38,870
but also the world at large.
Got It.

1927
01:57:38,871 --> 01:57:41,590
Get you've got to get that
propaganda working for you.

1928
01:57:42,610 --> 01:57:47,610
I've had a couple of companies I've been
working with lately and one of them was

1929
01:57:48,671 --> 01:57:53,671
being assaulted by its competitors
and it had a better product.

1930
01:57:56,790 --> 01:57:58,420
It's product was doing well,

1931
01:57:58,450 --> 01:58:01,240
but they were getting assaulted
and they were getting assaulted.

1932
01:58:01,390 --> 01:58:06,070
By the way with lies. Hmm.
Like the competitors are
just making stuff up, right?

1933
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,170
To making stuff up,
putting that word out there.

1934
01:58:08,470 --> 01:58:13,120
But now they're rumors on
officially, sir. And you know,

1935
01:58:13,121 --> 01:58:16,570
here's the thing the CEO was kind of did,

1936
01:58:16,760 --> 01:58:20,320
was quite sure what to do and I said,
you have the most towel,

1937
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:23,710
the most powerful tool in your arsenal.

1938
01:58:24,970 --> 01:58:29,680
It's the truth, but you got a weaponized
that truth. You got to weaponize it.

1939
01:58:29,681 --> 01:58:32,860
You've got to turn it into a weapon
that you can use to crush the lies.

1940
01:58:33,130 --> 01:58:35,350
Because if you're doing great things
and you're not telling anyone,

1941
01:58:35,590 --> 01:58:38,380
you're not putting out any propaganda,
well then guess what?

1942
01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:42,190
No one's going to know about it. You
just lost your, your valuable weapon,

1943
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,293
which is the truth.

1944
01:58:43,510 --> 01:58:46,900
If you're doing good things and your
product is better and you can prove that

1945
01:58:46,901 --> 01:58:48,460
it's better and people
know that it's better,

1946
01:58:48,520 --> 01:58:52,120
but you're not telling anyone
you're going, it doesn't matter.

1947
01:58:52,180 --> 01:58:54,280
You have to weaponize that
truth and get it out there.

1948
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:56,290
So that's what propaganda is.

1949
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:03,100
Now we are moving into
the conclusion right here

1950
01:59:05,140 --> 01:59:05,973
in brief,

1951
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:10,720
high morale has been defined as the
quality which makes men Indore and show

1952
01:59:10,721 --> 01:59:12,610
courage in times of fatigue and danger.

1953
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:16,750
The cultivation of morale depends
upon the training of leaders,

1954
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:18,970
the inculcation of discipline,

1955
01:59:18,971 --> 01:59:22,480
the encouragement of comradeship
and the infusing of self respect.

1956
01:59:22,750 --> 01:59:26,980
The leaders must have a belief in their
cause and they must pay attention to

1957
01:59:27,010 --> 01:59:31,510
numerous contributory factors of
considerable but secondary importance.

1958
01:59:33,230 --> 01:59:37,100
And here's how he closes it out man
is still the first weapon of war

1959
01:59:38,560 --> 01:59:42,850
is training is the most
important consideration in
the fashioning of a fighting

1960
01:59:42,851 --> 01:59:43,684
army.

1961
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:48,070
All modern science is directed
toward his assistance,

1962
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:51,700
but on his efforts depend
the outcome of the battle.

1963
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:57,880
The morale of the soldier is the
most important single factor in war.

1964
02:00:01,700 --> 02:00:04,750
So there he is saying it again,
the morale of the soldiers,

1965
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:07,520
the most important single factor and war.
And as I said,

1966
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:11,810
I will argue with that because as far
as I'm concerned, without question,

1967
02:00:11,811 --> 02:00:14,300
leadership is the most important thing
on the battlefield. And I'm actually,

1968
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:18,440
like I said, I'm thinking I'm
right. So no offense to Monte,

1969
02:00:18,441 --> 02:00:22,790
but I think I'm right because
his factors to review them.

1970
02:00:22,820 --> 02:00:27,650
Leadership, that's the number one factor.
Well, that's leadership discipline.

1971
02:00:27,740 --> 02:00:31,700
Where does that come from? Discipline
comes from leadership. Comradeship.

1972
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:36,080
Where does that come from? It comes
from good leadership, self respect.

1973
02:00:36,081 --> 02:00:39,410
Where does that come from? It I'm not,
I'm not saying that this would Monte Sang.

1974
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:41,540
Monte said that discipline
comes from leadership.

1975
02:00:41,780 --> 02:00:44,040
Monte said that comradeship
comes from leadership.

1976
02:00:44,050 --> 02:00:48,830
A Monte said that self respect comes from
leadership. So as far as I'm concerned,

1977
02:00:50,030 --> 02:00:51,720
no offense Monte,
as far as I'm concerned,

1978
02:00:51,721 --> 02:00:54,740
the leadership is the most
important thing on the battlefield.

1979
02:00:54,770 --> 02:00:56,990
But that being said,

1980
02:00:56,991 --> 02:01:01,991
let there be no doubt that morale
without question is a necessity and a

1981
02:01:02,061 --> 02:01:05,600
requirement for victory.
And I will add this.

1982
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:11,590
Morale is important,
extremely important,

1983
02:01:11,591 --> 02:01:16,591
not only for 18 not only for a military
unit or a business or any kind of

1984
02:01:17,711 --> 02:01:19,480
organization made up of people,

1985
02:01:19,481 --> 02:01:24,220
but morale is also
important for individuals.

1986
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:31,480
For us, day to day, how is your morale?

1987
02:01:32,140 --> 02:01:33,910
Where's your morale ad?

1988
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:36,610
Think about how you approach the
day when you're a morale is good.

1989
02:01:36,611 --> 02:01:40,640
Think about how you go into the day,
just like you're going into attack.

1990
02:01:40,641 --> 02:01:43,340
If you're, if you're going to attack
the enemy and your morale is high,

1991
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:47,450
you're going to attack with vigor and
you're probably going to be successful.

1992
02:01:47,480 --> 02:01:51,080
If you go in to attack the
enemy and your morale is low,

1993
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:54,470
you're going to attack without vigor,
without enthusiasm,

1994
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,180
and you're probably going to fail.
Well, what about you as a person?

1995
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:03,800
If your morale is low, guess
what? If you roll into the day,

1996
02:02:03,801 --> 02:02:06,800
you roll into your mission
and your morale is low,

1997
02:02:07,220 --> 02:02:09,050
likely you are going to fail.

1998
02:02:11,450 --> 02:02:16,450
So then the question is how do we increase
our personal or individual morale and

1999
02:02:17,631 --> 02:02:20,390
I think it's the same way
we improve team morale.

2000
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:22,210
Yeah.

2001
02:02:22,210 --> 02:02:26,470
We improve our personal
morale with discipline,

2002
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:33,690
with hardship in with privation and with
efficiency and with emotional control

2003
02:02:35,141 --> 02:02:36,670
and by facing our fears.

2004
02:02:36,671 --> 02:02:40,750
And of course most
important is leadership,

2005
02:02:43,650 --> 02:02:44,281
leadership,

2006
02:02:44,281 --> 02:02:49,281
leading yourself and not allowing
this leadership vacuum in your head.

2007
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:55,500
Right. When I was putting seals
through training park in the Dre,

2008
02:02:55,680 --> 02:02:57,360
if there was chaos broke out,

2009
02:02:57,361 --> 02:03:00,090
there were some times where no leader
would step up and take charge and that

2010
02:03:00,091 --> 02:03:03,720
would create a leadership vacuum and
it was hard to tell what's happening

2011
02:03:03,721 --> 02:03:05,580
because no one would be saying anything.

2012
02:03:06,030 --> 02:03:09,390
It would just be silence and
you didn't hear anything.

2013
02:03:09,450 --> 02:03:12,450
And so it's hard to recognize that all
of a sudden, wait a second, there's no,

2014
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:14,670
no one's leading. You don't recognize
it because it's not happening.

2015
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:16,470
It's like seeing something
that's not there.

2016
02:03:16,530 --> 02:03:19,710
It's not there so you don't think about
it. Well, when no one's leading do take.

2017
02:03:19,711 --> 02:03:21,450
Sometimes it can be hard to notice that,

2018
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:24,990
and I'd call that a leadership vacuum
and I teach these young seals like, hey,

2019
02:03:24,991 --> 02:03:26,970
when that happens, you
need to step up. Well,

2020
02:03:26,971 --> 02:03:28,350
the same thing can happen in your head.

2021
02:03:28,351 --> 02:03:30,900
You get this leadership vacuum in
your head. When you're not leading,

2022
02:03:30,901 --> 02:03:35,390
you're going to start to slide down the
path of least resistance you're going to

2023
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:39,600
do in a slip on down that slippery slope.

2024
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:41,670
You're going to walk away from discipline.

2025
02:03:41,671 --> 02:03:46,620
You're got to not impose hardship
him and privation on yourself,

2026
02:03:46,621 --> 02:03:51,621
you're not going to push yourself and
your morale is going to go down as well.

2027
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:53,210
Okay.

2028
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:55,390
And if your morale fails,
well

2029
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:56,690
yeah.

2030
02:03:56,690 --> 02:04:01,550
Becomes very easy for you to fail.
Don't,

2031
02:04:01,551 --> 02:04:05,510
don't allow that.
Don't allow your morale to fail.

2032
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:09,320
Lift up your morale,
increase your morale by

2033
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:14,030
inflicting yourself with discipline,

2034
02:04:16,650 --> 02:04:19,740
by doing hard things,
by controlling your emotions,

2035
02:04:19,950 --> 02:04:24,630
by controlling yourself and by
leading yourself on the path.

2036
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:26,590
Okay.

2037
02:04:26,590 --> 02:04:28,900
Of discipline,
which as we know

2038
02:04:31,090 --> 02:04:31,923
leads to freedom.

2039
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:36,790
And I think that's actually all I forgot

2040
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:41,990
for tonight. So Echo Charles. Yes.

2041
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:47,240
Speaking of controlling ourselves
and leading our selves down the path,

2042
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:56,130
I know you've got some,
let's say some guideposts on the path,

2043
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:57,690
some markers on the path.

2044
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:01,350
I do some signals pointing
in the right direction.

2045
02:05:01,560 --> 02:05:05,900
Huge to get us down the path. Yeah. So
I was thinking about this today. Hmm.

2046
02:05:08,130 --> 02:05:10,710
I'm watching my daughter's performance.

2047
02:05:10,740 --> 02:05:15,370
Little seen performance
check this morning. All good.
Um, so for whatever reason,

2048
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:20,400
good, fine. It was a big group.
But what grade kindergarten though?

2049
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:22,470
What grade did you give
her when she was done?

2050
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,650
I didn't give a grade.

2051
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:27,900
How's she going to know how she's
going to improve her performance?

2052
02:05:28,950 --> 02:05:31,860
I'll give her a, when she
gets home check. Okay, good.

2053
02:05:31,890 --> 02:05:36,480
What you're going to give her foot grid
up but probably f for sure because it's

2054
02:05:36,481 --> 02:05:40,810
a long story that's beside the
point by the way. An AF, yeah.

2055
02:05:40,990 --> 02:05:44,340
What'd she do? You know, just it was,

2056
02:05:44,700 --> 02:05:48,620
there were some things that
happen post-performance what?

2057
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:50,330
That two years that,

2058
02:05:50,710 --> 02:05:54,510
that I didn't approve of the reason
for them telling them to do it more,

2059
02:05:54,511 --> 02:05:57,320
but what happened then? I
will go over that later. Um,

2060
02:05:57,370 --> 02:06:01,200
so the point is I'm thinking
like what is the path,

2061
02:06:01,350 --> 02:06:04,620
this is probably the first time I've
ever wanted you to go into detail on the

2062
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:07,520
story.
Um,

2063
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:13,080
did she freak out when she shy? Just
give us a global deal? She was, yeah.

2064
02:06:13,081 --> 02:06:16,200
So she's shy. She's performing good,
fine. Like, you know, the whole,

2065
02:06:16,230 --> 02:06:19,950
it's the whole class. Um, you know, I had
a like, what do you call it? An assembly.

2066
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:22,980
Okay. Yeah. And so we're
talking a hundred kids on stage,

2067
02:06:23,220 --> 02:06:27,100
or is it just one class and there's
only 25 kids on stage and it's not even

2068
02:06:27,180 --> 02:06:29,460
really a stage. It's like,
okay, it's in the classroom

2069
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:34,770
in real official scenario. Yeah.
So she goes, yeah, they go,

2070
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:38,060
they perform good as far as
performance goes fine. You know,

2071
02:06:38,110 --> 02:06:39,540
she remembered the song,

2072
02:06:39,570 --> 02:06:44,070
she performed it in front of us the night
before and the night before that all

2073
02:06:44,071 --> 02:06:44,904
good.

2074
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:49,170
But then they had to sit down and
then the assembly sorta went on.

2075
02:06:49,860 --> 02:06:54,210
So they are sitting down and I look over
and I see you're crying. Which I didn't,

2076
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:57,330
I was confused, but I know my
daughter, like, she's like,

2077
02:06:57,331 --> 02:07:01,860
she softy like that my fault. I
know. So she's looking back on me,

2078
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:08,910
looking back to me all salty and I'm,
I'm like,

2079
02:07:09,780 --> 02:07:13,320
I'm not concerned because I
know something didn't go wrong.

2080
02:07:13,321 --> 02:07:15,450
Something's happening that
she just doesn't like clay.

2081
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:19,230
She's tired of sitting there or something
like that. So she's looking back at me.

2082
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:22,950
I'm just like, you know, I don't give
it that much attention. Later on,

2083
02:07:22,951 --> 02:07:25,380
I find out as she's walking tour class,

2084
02:07:25,381 --> 02:07:29,610
cause after assembly they go to
their class and she's like, Oh yeah,

2085
02:07:29,611 --> 02:07:31,830
I didn't like how long
the assembly was going on.

2086
02:07:32,250 --> 02:07:34,680
That's what she said to me
and that's why she was crying.

2087
02:07:34,860 --> 02:07:38,800
That's why she ain't tall.
And here's the thing,

2088
02:07:39,620 --> 02:07:43,090
she shouldn't feel that strongly about it.

2089
02:07:43,150 --> 02:07:46,310
You know there's something else going
on to be honest with you, bro. Shit,

2090
02:07:46,810 --> 02:07:49,670
she's like a softy.
She's like us.

2091
02:07:49,671 --> 02:07:54,580
I like it when things don't go her way
in certain ways and she's uncomfortable

2092
02:07:54,581 --> 02:07:56,950
or whatever. If I were you
hard break it down like this,

2093
02:07:57,250 --> 02:08:01,260
I wouldn't just give her an f across the
board. I would give her like a breakout,

2094
02:08:01,270 --> 02:08:06,270
maybe some different different categories
I'd give her like an a for singing or

2095
02:08:07,331 --> 02:08:10,210
maybe a B, you know what I mean? Cause
he bribed, not hitting every note. Right.

2096
02:08:10,660 --> 02:08:15,110
Maybe a B minus or whatever. And
then give her presence. I to,

2097
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:17,050
this is how I used to grade my kids
when they would do stuff like this,

2098
02:08:17,051 --> 02:08:21,100
I'd give them presence, I give him
attitude. I'd give them clarity,

2099
02:08:21,250 --> 02:08:24,530
Annunciation. Like there's a bunch
of things you can break it down and,

2100
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:28,000
and you don't want to give her five
o was across the board obviously.

2101
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,510
Cause she know five Oh performer
not at age six don't exist. No,

2102
02:08:31,540 --> 02:08:36,280
not a biker downloads. Right.
So, so, but then you say, listen,

2103
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:40,690
by the way, all your performance, which
you have a, you know, you got a 3.8 on,

2104
02:08:41,260 --> 02:08:42,490
that's your average score.

2105
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:47,600
Post-Performance behavior
had to give you a zero.

2106
02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:50,950
Zero. Yeah. Tears, weakness.

2107
02:08:51,700 --> 02:08:54,550
Don't ever let these other
kids know that you've been,

2108
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:56,600
you should be avenue attitude.
I could stand out here.

2109
02:08:56,601 --> 02:09:00,590
It can sit out here all day
and also simply bring it check.

2110
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:05,590
All right, so as this is unfolding,
no, this more to the story. Okay,

2111
02:09:05,620 --> 02:09:08,900
well that wasn't the point
that all the setting,

2112
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:14,830
I was just thinking like, you know,
what is the, what does the path look?

2113
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:18,700
What does that, is it just the stuff
that Jocko does and now we do it? No,

2114
02:09:18,790 --> 02:09:23,020
it's not that. Not at all actually
credit. Some of the stuff you do,

2115
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:26,410
in my opinion is essential.

2116
02:09:28,270 --> 02:09:32,660
Quintessential. Yeah. It's
like ideal. Right. Okay.

2117
02:09:32,700 --> 02:09:36,260
That's what I think that's
might be missing the by a lot.

2118
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:39,970
My coming into a solid Tutu
most most people. Yeah,

2119
02:09:39,971 --> 02:09:43,360
but that's just you being hard
on the stand on the scale.

2120
02:09:43,420 --> 02:09:48,040
I don't write on yourself, put it this
way. The Path is something specific,

2121
02:09:48,041 --> 02:09:51,700
but more than that I just, I
just realized, not realized,

2122
02:09:51,701 --> 02:09:54,370
but more like consciously
thought of what's not the path.

2123
02:09:54,610 --> 02:09:58,090
That's what that's important. So it's
like, okay, if you're doing Jujitsu,

2124
02:09:58,100 --> 02:09:59,100
are you not on the path?

2125
02:09:59,101 --> 02:10:03,700
And not necessarily you have to be doing
or neglecting some very specific things

2126
02:10:03,701 --> 02:10:07,870
to not be on the path. Like if you
don't care about what you're eating,

2127
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:11,830
like you're just like whatever
feels sounds good tonight.

2128
02:10:11,831 --> 02:10:14,710
That's told the total standard
in which you base your

2129
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:20,500
meals on, you're probably not on
the path. That's a big indicator.

2130
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:24,180
One of the factors. And it's an area
where you need to tighten things up. Yes.

2131
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:27,670
We know you're not performing optimally
if you're not eating correctly,

2132
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:31,690
you know that. So we'll just say that
element is considered not on the path.

2133
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,480
All right? Sure. So as the, and that's
just one example of many, you know,

2134
02:10:35,481 --> 02:10:38,890
like if you just straight up don't
exercise at all. You know, and I'm not,

2135
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:42,380
and some people have active lifestyles
in general and they don't consider it

2136
02:10:42,381 --> 02:10:45,590
quote unquote exercise. I get it, but,
and then that's different or whatever.

2137
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:49,130
But if you're inactive,
you're sedentary, that's bad.

2138
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,790
That quality is not on the path.
See what I'm saying?

2139
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,770
So basically what is not on the path is
if you have most of the elements of your

2140
02:10:57,771 --> 02:11:01,340
life is not on the path.
You'll know also,

2141
02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:05,630
there's also a really broad thing
because you could, you don't,

2142
02:11:06,590 --> 02:11:11,570
even if you're, even if you're trying,
right, that's what the path is.

2143
02:11:11,850 --> 02:11:16,130
The Path is trying, right. The Path is
like, Hey, I'm trunk now. I guess. Yeah.

2144
02:11:16,131 --> 02:11:19,010
I guess that's a little bit strong
because I can say I'm trying to work out,

2145
02:11:19,011 --> 02:11:23,810
but I just did it again. You're not
on the voucher. That's a good point.

2146
02:11:23,870 --> 02:11:26,540
Yes. But you don't have to be, you know,

2147
02:11:26,541 --> 02:11:30,090
doing the nine hour workout. Yeah. With,

2148
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:34,940
with a six hour Jujitsu
session afterwards. No. Like,
Oh, you only had an hour.

2149
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,060
You only had 30 minutes to train
today. Cool. Got It done quick.

2150
02:11:38,061 --> 02:11:40,850
I did a pretty quick, where I did 20
minutes today. That's what I got to,

2151
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:45,410
I got flew in late last night. Woke
up this morning. I had another call.

2152
02:11:45,411 --> 02:11:48,170
So I was like, okay, cool. I'm
going to hammer this thing out.

2153
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:51,290
I had that window closing too, you
know, you know the window was like,

2154
02:11:51,291 --> 02:11:55,490
well maybe we'll just pull.
Yeah, that's real. You know. No,

2155
02:11:55,640 --> 02:11:59,420
you can't let the window close.
Yup. That was a really good concept.

2156
02:11:59,421 --> 02:12:03,710
We talked about the Jujitsu window.
Yes. It happens with working out too.

2157
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:06,620
Right?
Even though that's mostly self-imposed,

2158
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:09,740
it is mostly selfimposed for working out,
but it does happen.

2159
02:12:09,741 --> 02:12:12,680
And if you have work to do legitimate
work, do you have meetings?

2160
02:12:12,681 --> 02:12:14,600
You have calls and you're
like, well, you know,

2161
02:12:14,601 --> 02:12:18,380
I took that one call or I woke up
this morning in all, well, you know,

2162
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,890
I got that call and it,
wait a second, I, you know,

2163
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:24,140
brushing my teeth and wait a second,
I just gotta check my email. Oh,

2164
02:12:24,141 --> 02:12:26,210
now the window,
it's all knowing when to just shut.

2165
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:28,310
Now I'm gonna have to work out later,
which will never happen.

2166
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:30,400
Don't let the window shut.
Yeah,

2167
02:12:30,710 --> 02:12:35,150
just jump through it and man jumps
through the window. But Hey man,

2168
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:41,320
and to recognize what the Path isn't is
just important as recognizing what the

2169
02:12:41,661 --> 02:12:45,200
path is. Because if you're like, hey,
are you trying to like, I don't know,

2170
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:48,890
what do people say? Like are you
trying to improve yourself or whatever.

2171
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:52,280
Most people will say yes, they'll be
like, oh yeah, look at all the things.

2172
02:12:52,580 --> 02:12:56,000
But it's like you kind of know,
you know, like it's different.

2173
02:12:56,060 --> 02:12:58,730
You just sorta know like
if you're doing Jujitsu,

2174
02:12:58,731 --> 02:13:01,970
you're sort of on the path with
that alone. Maybe not fully,

2175
02:13:01,971 --> 02:13:05,240
but that is a legitimate element.
So when you did you get too,

2176
02:13:05,241 --> 02:13:08,590
if you're new or not new, whatever,
you're going to need a geek.

2177
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:10,610
You know what gear we getting?

2178
02:13:10,670 --> 02:13:13,430
I think we all know origin
because they are the best keys.

2179
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:17,180
So how are they the best keys?
Okay, so if you just put one on,

2180
02:13:17,181 --> 02:13:20,570
you'll sort of know. But here's the main
indicator. Won't go too deep into it.

2181
02:13:20,600 --> 02:13:25,600
But coach Adam [inaudible] the same
coach in way of the where where your kid,

2182
02:13:25,941 --> 02:13:27,590
by the way,
there's a real coach Adam.

2183
02:13:27,610 --> 02:13:32,430
So coach Adam puts on his
rift gooey inside out top,

2184
02:13:32,720 --> 02:13:33,960
get up inside out.

2185
02:13:34,470 --> 02:13:39,420
I think he thought it was correct and
that was indicative of just cause it shows

2186
02:13:39,421 --> 02:13:41,940
the stitching. You know when you're
going get set up shows a stitching.

2187
02:13:41,970 --> 02:13:43,510
And I looked at it, I was
like, Dang, that looks,

2188
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:45,150
that looks kind of cool right there.

2189
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:50,410
Because Pete was saying he took the genes
origin genes, which are now out. Uh,

2190
02:13:50,910 --> 02:13:52,680
and he was, he turned
around, he said, hey,

2191
02:13:52,681 --> 02:13:56,010
if you want to know what the quality
of these genes turned them in,

2192
02:13:56,070 --> 02:13:57,060
he turned them inside out and he's like,

2193
02:13:57,061 --> 02:13:58,260
look at what they were
working from the inside.

2194
02:13:58,261 --> 02:14:01,860
So now you have Adam who sees that you
put this gear on inside out because the

2195
02:14:01,861 --> 02:14:03,510
quality is so high that
you can't even tell.

2196
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:05,630
He thought that was the
correct way to do it.

2197
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:08,310
And he thought that was what was cracking.
Meanwhile,

2198
02:14:08,311 --> 02:14:10,170
the logo is all backwards and stuff.
So you know,

2199
02:14:10,171 --> 02:14:11,640
he really should have known that,
but you know,

2200
02:14:12,050 --> 02:14:14,010
to each their own and it
looked good either way.

2201
02:14:14,070 --> 02:14:16,110
So that's where we're at with origin.

2202
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:19,410
We got clothing including jeans,

2203
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:24,300
Jeez t shirts, sweatshirts, uh,

2204
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,830
other stuff. And then we got supplements
as well. Yeah. Supplements are good.

2205
02:14:29,130 --> 02:14:31,820
Joint Warfare. I think I'm
talking to Greg Train, right?

2206
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:35,750
One of our main training partners
and he has an AC joint situation.

2207
02:14:36,090 --> 02:14:37,200
Two sides by the way.

2208
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:43,040
And I'm till am telling him if you put
together the joint or fair with the Super

2209
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:48,780
Krill oil discipline every single day,
that thing he'll straight up faster,

2210
02:14:48,781 --> 02:14:52,710
measurably faster, hundred
percent. Then just, you know,
look at my niece situation,

2211
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:56,630
which amen. I'm a believer now
you're now a believer. Yeah.

2212
02:14:57,640 --> 02:14:58,160
I'm,

2213
02:14:58,160 --> 02:15:03,160
I increased my beliefs of my own personal
kind of like wolverine healing powers,

2214
02:15:04,860 --> 02:15:07,110
which I have joked about performing even
though it wasn't really Joe. You know,

2215
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,950
you know, you joke about something
but you kind of mean it. Yeah.

2216
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:15,190
I feel real lucky man. Real lucky
because my knee was straight up. Yeah.

2217
02:15:16,180 --> 02:15:20,880
Injured. And it's not healed yet, but
Dang, if it hasn't progressed a lot. Yeah.

2218
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:25,940
Yeah. And it's not like, you know,
when you're like 18 years old, uh,

2219
02:15:26,010 --> 02:15:28,080
maybe a lighter weight
person or something,

2220
02:15:28,081 --> 02:15:31,620
it's like you tend to sort of heal
faster. Let's face it, you're, you know,

2221
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:34,930
you're old school and you're
not wearing a small school or

2222
02:15:37,120 --> 02:15:41,940
your old school and you know, what are
you walking around at two 30 to 35.

2223
02:15:41,941 --> 02:15:42,421
I mean that,

2224
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:45,630
I'm just saying that's not an easy
racket for the knees all the time.

2225
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:48,960
Meanwhile you're just boom, boom,
boom, bouncing back that fast.

2226
02:15:48,961 --> 02:15:53,640
That's saying a lot. Joint
Warfare, Krill oil. Uh,

2227
02:15:53,820 --> 02:15:57,480
get some of that.
Also the discipline and the discipline go.

2228
02:15:57,840 --> 02:16:02,550
I had a scenario the other
day that's actually yesterday.

2229
02:16:02,700 --> 02:16:07,560
Sure. Crazy flight situation,
thunderstorms, rerouting landing buses,

2230
02:16:07,561 --> 02:16:10,770
trains is ridiculous. Anyways, I,

2231
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:15,280
I'm going into an interview on
two hours of sleep all day. Yeah.

2232
02:16:15,990 --> 02:16:18,180
And this is just after,
you know,

2233
02:16:18,240 --> 02:16:21,390
Peter a t is telling me
about all the horrible

2234
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:24,690
like cognitive

2235
02:16:26,360 --> 02:16:30,550
that are going to give you cause
and so yeah, I took, I took like,

2236
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:35,460
I took like two discipline go. Right when
I woke up I was like, all right, hey,

2237
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:38,560
I got an interview and like, and then
I got there and I did a little bit of,

2238
02:16:38,920 --> 02:16:40,390
you know,
playing around or not playing around,

2239
02:16:40,391 --> 02:16:44,260
but they're like prepping
for the interview. And then
I took like three more,

2240
02:16:44,590 --> 02:16:49,180
so I took five. Discipline
goes, rocked it. I read it.

2241
02:16:49,210 --> 02:16:53,430
I was like a what? You got to a question?
Oh, let me tell you a link. So anyways,

2242
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:55,420
try that discipline.
Go out.

2243
02:16:55,421 --> 02:17:00,421
If you need something to
focus your cognitive skills,

2244
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:04,120
skills, skills, for sure
you can get some of that.

2245
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:08,830
Or you can get the discipline go and you
need the discipline powder. Yeah. Should,

2246
02:17:08,831 --> 02:17:11,360
we've just called that pre jujitsu powder.
Yeah.

2247
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:13,380
That's it's sorting itself out to be,

2248
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:17,110
it kind of sounds like something
where you are. We're going to Jujitsu,

2249
02:17:17,170 --> 02:17:20,470
you know you're going to need cognitive
skills and you know you're gonna need

2250
02:17:20,471 --> 02:17:23,830
some physical skills or some physical

2251
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:29,410
enhancements. Sure. So you just jump
on a couple of scoops of discipline.

2252
02:17:29,411 --> 02:17:33,550
Maybe three if you need to, if you want
to get nuts. Yeah, that's a good one.

2253
02:17:33,551 --> 02:17:37,870
That's part of my everyday now I'm pulling
the Dave Burke. Yeah, yeah, that's,

2254
02:17:37,871 --> 02:17:40,990
that's I was, look, there's
one thing that's good about it.

2255
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:43,320
He doesn't have some crazy
amount of caffeine in it. Right?

2256
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:46,720
You don't want to be all
amped up on caffeine when
you take something called the

2257
02:17:46,721 --> 02:17:47,980
stuff too makes me feel really good.
Well,

2258
02:17:47,981 --> 02:17:51,220
you just took a big hit of caffeine and
you're going to get, what's that word?

2259
02:17:51,221 --> 02:17:53,590
You're going to get a tolerance to it and
then it's not going to have the effect

2260
02:17:53,591 --> 02:17:56,800
that you want. Discipline has like
15 milligrams of caffeine per scoop.

2261
02:17:56,801 --> 02:17:59,560
That's not that much. So what you
feel when you feel like the zoo,

2262
02:18:00,460 --> 02:18:04,150
you're not really feeling, you're
feeling the other ingredients in there.

2263
02:18:04,420 --> 02:18:09,280
So don't, don't fool yourself into
getting all amped up on caffeine,

2264
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:10,750
you know,
or otherwise.

2265
02:18:10,751 --> 02:18:14,950
You might as well go do meth or cocaine
or just drink some coffee, whichever,

2266
02:18:16,390 --> 02:18:18,610
you know, that's kind of off
the, no, I'm just kidding.

2267
02:18:18,640 --> 02:18:23,290
Children don't do meth or cocaine.
Don't do drugs, period. However,

2268
02:18:24,010 --> 02:18:28,750
if you want to do something that
gives you a sort of a addiction,

2269
02:18:29,740 --> 02:18:33,490
try some strawberry milk,
which is now out for adults.

2270
02:18:33,820 --> 02:18:35,590
It is absolutely delicious.

2271
02:18:35,620 --> 02:18:39,910
If you want some extra protein in
your body so you can get bigger,

2272
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:44,770
stronger, faster, better,

2273
02:18:45,010 --> 02:18:47,860
yeah, true. And you an or,

2274
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:52,510
or if you just want dessert,
if you just want some dessert,

2275
02:18:52,690 --> 02:18:56,980
have some strawberry milk or some peanut
butter milk or some mint Malke or some

2276
02:18:56,981 --> 02:19:01,720
vanilla or dark chocolate. And
there you go. Jocko white tea.

2277
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:07,230
If you're into tea or even if
you're not into t really t you know,

2278
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:09,720
against it.
But you know,

2279
02:19:09,790 --> 02:19:14,320
it's one of those things still
the Oji original Jocko, White Tea,

2280
02:19:14,321 --> 02:19:18,250
pomegranate, pomegranate, Chai.

2281
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:20,440
No white tea.

2282
02:19:21,130 --> 02:19:24,580
Jocko decides to make his own
light tea with side effects,

2283
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:29,000
deadlifting 8,000 pounds, I'll roll
with it. It's actually pretty good.

2284
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:32,780
So yet get that. It is available
and Jocko stored now by the way,

2285
02:19:33,290 --> 02:19:37,670
and Amazon and you know, just go on
the Internet basically and get it.

2286
02:19:38,930 --> 02:19:43,750
So yeah, that's a good one. Um, speaking
is Jocko store. Jocko does have a story.

2287
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:45,170
It's called Jocko store.

2288
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:48,560
Just like this is called Jocko
podcast called Jocko store,

2289
02:19:48,620 --> 02:19:50,600
so drugstore.com that's
where his online store,

2290
02:19:50,601 --> 02:19:55,601
this is where you can get rash guards
for you Jujitsu to supplement your gies

2291
02:19:56,450 --> 02:20:00,380
from origin.
Also t-shirts Nogi correct.

2292
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,460
You can wear a rash guard. Oh yeah, yeah.

2293
02:20:02,461 --> 02:20:07,070
It's kind of workouts using your rings.

2294
02:20:07,430 --> 02:20:10,820
If you're doing dips, if you're doing
ring pushups, if you're doing muscle ups,

2295
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:12,740
you're the,
what is it,

2296
02:20:12,741 --> 02:20:16,840
the what Greg chain say like the
outside of your arm he's got,

2297
02:20:16,850 --> 02:20:20,660
he was always got the medical
term surfing your radial whatever.

2298
02:20:20,661 --> 02:20:22,810
You'll get all like chafed up.
Yeah.

2299
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:25,700
When you're doing a bunch of muscle ops
or a bunch of ring dips or whatever.

2300
02:20:25,730 --> 02:20:29,630
If you weren't a rash guard, do you won't
owe jack going for comfort over here.

2301
02:20:29,630 --> 02:20:33,440
Speaking of comfort, if you
like, even though I got into
riding bike a little bit,

2302
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:37,400
not totally, but if you were a rash
guard riding bike, like cycling,

2303
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:40,580
it's like surprisingly,

2304
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:45,110
I'm going to say it's surprisingly
comfortable. Functional, it's functional.

2305
02:20:45,890 --> 02:20:49,620
So you know, there's a lot of other
things we do with our rash guards. Um,

2306
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,760
and actually I forgot to say this,
we forgot to say this for a while.

2307
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:58,070
It does add another 19% performance
and literally everything you do,

2308
02:20:58,400 --> 02:20:59,233
literally

2309
02:21:01,570 --> 02:21:06,200
100% also tee shirts if you want to
represent discipline equals freedom. Good.

2310
02:21:06,201 --> 02:21:06,431
Any,

2311
02:21:06,431 --> 02:21:11,431
any of the layers that we've come to
exploit that the correct term terminology

2312
02:21:13,190 --> 02:21:15,620
makes exploit the layers anyway.

2313
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:19,430
Lower the legs for sure that
sometimes you exploit the layers,

2314
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:24,380
which is questionable behavior.

2334
02:22:37,590 --> 02:22:40,460
share them with your friends.
It's not like, Hey, I saw this,

2335
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:43,610
I got a cool idea for you.
Here's a four hour podcast,

2336
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:46,560
watch the whole thing just
listened to you. You'll catch
it. I forget where it is,

2337
02:22:46,561 --> 02:22:48,280
but it's in there somewhere yet.

2338
02:22:48,281 --> 02:22:51,960
And I can listen to that on a
whim so you can just, you know,

2339
02:22:52,510 --> 02:22:54,930
so that's what we should have called them.

2340
02:22:56,040 --> 02:23:00,840
Little little video hitters. Sure. There
you go. I like that better than mcnuggets.

2341
02:23:01,870 --> 02:23:04,890
You're the one who made up Jocko mcnugget
doesn't mean I can't change my mind

2342
02:23:04,891 --> 02:23:09,360
and come up with something better on the
little video hitter. That video hit her.

2343
02:23:09,361 --> 02:23:13,470
You need to make more of those hitters.
Yes sir. There you go. But nonetheless,

2344
02:23:13,471 --> 02:23:16,560
if you are interested in any video things,
hitters,

2345
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,140
hitters in regards to this,

2346
02:23:19,141 --> 02:23:23,010
but it's probably an acquired situation.

2347
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:27,270
It just sounds cooler when Theo says
it and you're saying, so I'm like,

2348
02:23:27,360 --> 02:23:31,050
I'm used to you saying it, so that's
cool. But me saying I'm not ready yet,

2349
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:32,520
but I'll get there.

2350
02:23:32,600 --> 02:23:37,600

2372
02:24:59,230 --> 02:25:03,240
The kettle bells have been a huge part

Oh yeah. Build enough

Keno, runny noses, but you just
hit when your kids going to school.

2379
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:23,980

2387
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:55,540
The publishing company is me,

2388
02:25:57,310 --> 02:25:59,500
so if you want to have this book,

2389
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:03,670
please preorder it asap so I
know how many copies to print.

2390
02:26:04,150 --> 02:26:07,780
The name of the book is the way of
the warrior kid three and I'm actually

2391
02:26:07,781 --> 02:26:11,860
putting that on the cover now.
When I made way of the warrior kid too,

2392
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:16,030
I said to the publisher, Hey, can we put
way of the warrior kid too on the cover?

2393
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:21,010
And they said, no, we can't do that. And
I said, well why not? And they said, well,

2394
02:26:21,130 --> 02:26:25,270
if people know it's the second in the
series and they don't have the first,

2395
02:26:25,271 --> 02:26:29,110
they won't buy it.
So we can't put that on the cover.

2396
02:26:29,111 --> 02:26:33,670
We don't want to hurt sales. So I
said, oh, I thought to myself, oh,

2397
02:26:33,671 --> 02:26:37,390
we're just trying to confuse
people so they will buy more.

2398
02:26:37,450 --> 02:26:40,530
I'm not trying to confuse anybody here.
Way of the warrior kid.

2399
02:26:40,531 --> 02:26:44,560
Three on the cover is the
third book in the series.

2400
02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:46,001
John Bozak,

2401
02:26:46,001 --> 02:26:50,320
the artist thinks it's the best book
in the series lessons to be learned.

2402
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:54,340
Interesting.
There's also a way of the warrior kid too.

2403
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:58,600
We're just called Mark's
mission and there's the
original way of the warrior kid

2404
02:26:59,830 --> 02:27:03,700
and then on top of that for your
children and possibly for you too,

2405
02:27:03,701 --> 02:27:08,170
we got Mikey and the dragons.
You can order that one now

2406
02:27:09,820 --> 02:27:11,560
for your younger kids.

2407
02:27:11,590 --> 02:27:14,290
Also the discipline equals freedom field
manual already talked about that one.

2408
02:27:14,291 --> 02:27:17,410
The audio of that is on Itunes,
not on audible,

2409
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:21,370
so it's on an MP three and then extreme
ownership and dichotomy of leadership,

2410
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:26,650
which I wrote with my brother Leif Babin
and we talk about leadership from our

2411
02:27:26,651 --> 02:27:29,860
perspective going from
the military combat,

2412
02:27:30,310 --> 02:27:35,170
taking those lessons learned to bringing
them back and now turning them over to

2413
02:27:35,171 --> 02:27:36,730
the civilian sector.

2414
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:41,760
And on top of that we also
have a leadership consultancy
called echelon front

2415
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,040
where we solve problems
through leadership.

2416
02:27:45,070 --> 02:27:49,780

and speak to your company, including me,

2419
02:27:56,200 --> 02:27:58,360
don't reach out to a speaker's bureau.

2420
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:03,460
Don't Google Jocko speaking and click

that are in the book,

2433
02:28:55,161 --> 02:28:58,580
extreme ownership and the dichotomy of
leadership and everything I talk about on

this podcast, it's, it's in there concise,

2435

clear ways so people can understand it.
And then on top of that, it's interactive.

2436
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:10,160

2449
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:11,530
The Facebook. Uh, Facebook, you know the,
the Facebook is the original gene. Yeah.

2450
02:30:11,531 --> 02:30:15,320
Yeah. I didn't know about Justin
Timberlake was like, Hey, don't, sorry.

2451
02:30:15,321 --> 02:30:19,250
Not Justin Timberlake. Sean Parker
Parker. Anyway, he ever seen the movie?

2452
02:30:19,251 --> 02:30:22,500
It shows when was the
reason he said drop the,

2453
02:30:22,510 --> 02:30:27,500
the just Facebook. Who says that
cleaner? Sean Parker, the Napster Guy.

2454
02:30:27,530 --> 02:30:32,510
Oh, okay. Played by Justin Timberlake in
the movie. Uh, got it. Got It. Very good.

2455
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:36,820
Well if you're on those
platforms, sure. Yeah.

2456
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:41,600
Echo is echo Charles Jocko is that Jocko
Willink on all of them both keep it

2457
02:30:41,601 --> 02:30:46,601
simple like that and thanks to all of
our military folks out there who keep

2458
02:30:49,221 --> 02:30:54,221
their morale high and keep their
bayonets sharp out there on the line.

2459
02:30:54,951 --> 02:30:59,930
And thanks to the police
and law enforcement and
firefighters and paramedics and

2460
02:30:59,931 --> 02:31:04,250
EMT and dispatchers and correctional
officers and border patrol and secret

2461
02:31:04,251 --> 02:31:06,470
service and all the
other first responders.

2462
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:12,880
Thanks to all of you for standing up and
facing evil so that we don't have to.

2463
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,040
And to everyone else out there,
do your

2464
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:22,090
okay.

2465
02:31:22,090 --> 02:31:22,930
Your morale,

2466
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:28,570
my below from time to
time they can happen.

2467
02:31:29,650 --> 02:31:30,000
Okay.

2468
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:33,720
Can happen to anyone.
And it does happen to everyone,

2469
02:31:33,721 --> 02:31:36,420
and when it does start to slip,

2470
02:31:36,421 --> 02:31:40,560
recognize it and then remember that
you can actually do something about it.

2471
02:31:43,040 --> 02:31:47,780
Like young [inaudible].
Rowbury said in that letter,

2472
02:31:47,810 --> 02:31:52,070
don't grieve. Don't cry. Don't worry,

2473
02:31:52,130 --> 02:31:57,020
or fret. Surely there's no
better way of dying. He said

2474
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:00,793
fighting

2475
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:05,630
then standing up,
and that is what you do.

2476
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:07,670
Yeah,

2477
02:32:07,670 --> 02:32:10,970
you fight, you stand up, you
impose discipline on your life.

2478
02:32:10,971 --> 02:32:13,940
You face the things that you fear,

2479
02:32:14,480 --> 02:32:18,260
the things that are crushing your morale.
You face some,

2480
02:32:20,290 --> 02:32:24,020
and you lift up your morale
through force of will. By leading,

2481
02:32:24,260 --> 02:32:25,550
by going out.

2482
02:32:26,970 --> 02:32:29,180
Okay.
Then getting after it.

2483
02:32:31,320 --> 02:32:36,060
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2484
02:32:37,490 --> 02:32:37,970
out.
