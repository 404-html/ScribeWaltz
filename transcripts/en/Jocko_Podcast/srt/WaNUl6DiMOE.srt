00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,700
This is Jocko podcast number
103 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,280
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,620
whilst lying at Winchester young
as I was in the profession,

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,890
I was picked out amongst others to perform
a piece of duty that for many years

5
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:25,051
afterwards remain deeply impressed upon
my mind and gave me the first impression

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,360
of the stern duties of a soldier's life.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,030
Okay.

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,030
A private of the 70th regiment had
deserted from that core and afterwards

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,390
enlisted into several other regiments.
Indeed,

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,600
I was told at the time that 16 different
times he had received the bounty and

11
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,100
then stolen off being
however caught at last,

12
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:55,101
he was brought to trial at Smith and
sentenced by General Court Martial to be

13
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,544
shot.

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,200
Okay.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,040
As the execution would be a
good hint to us, a young ins.

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,570
There were four lads picked out of our
core to assist in this piece of duty.

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,000
Myself being one of the number chosen

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,430
besides these men for soldiers from
three other regiments were ordered on the

19
00:01:17,431 --> 00:01:20,190
firing party making 16 at all.

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:27,490
The place of execution was ports down
hill and the different regiments assembled

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,330
must have composed a force of about
15,000 men having been assembled from the

22
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,790
isle of Wight, from
Chester, Chester, golf,

23
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,830
sport and other places.

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:41,720
Okay.

25
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,720
The site was very imposing and appeared
to make a deep impression on all their,

26
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,450
as for myself,

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,290
I felt that I would have
given a good round some had.

28
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:59,291
I possessed it to have been in any other
situation rather than one rather than

29
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:02,180
the one which I now found myself.

30
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,380
And when I looked into the
faces of my companions,

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,050
I saw by the pallor and anxiety,

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,900
anxiety depicted in each countenance,

33
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,810
the reflection of my own feelings.

34
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,203
Okay.

35
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:22,100
When all was ready, we were moved to the
front and the culprit was brought out.

36
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:23,980
Yeah.

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:28,980
He made a short speech to the parade
acknowledging the justice of his sentence

38
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,210
and that drinking and evil company
had brought the punishment upon him.

39
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,680
He behaved himself firmly and well
and did not seem to flinch at all.

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,110
After being blindfolded.
He does.

41
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,150
He was desired to kneel down behind a
coffin, which was placed on the ground.

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,360
And the drum major of the depot
giving us an expressive glance.

43
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,830
We immediately commenced to loading.

44
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,410
This was done in the deepest silence
and the next moment we were primed and

45
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:08,244
ready.

46
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,880
There was then a dreadful pause for a
few moments and the drum major again

47
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,980
looking towards us,
gave us the signal,

48
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,981
agreed upon before a flourish
of his cane and we leveled

49
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,533
and fired.

50
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,980
We had been previously strictly enjoined
to be steady and take good aim and the

51
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:37,850
poor fellow pierced by several
balls fell heavily upon his back

52
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,870
as he lay with his arms
pinion to his sides.

53
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,490
I observed that his hands waived for
a few moments like the fins on a fish.

54
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,410
When in the agonies of death,

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,280
the drum major also observed the
movement and making another signal.

56
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,080
Four of our Party immediately stepped
up to the posture a body and placing the

57
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:07,280
muscles of their pieces to the head
fired and put him out of his misery.

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,463
Okay.

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,480
The different regiments then fell back
by companies and the word being given to

60
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:20,620
march past in slow time when each
company came in line with the body,

61
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,950
the word was given to mark time and then
eyes left in order that we all might

62
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,410
observe.
The terrible example.

63
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,170
We then moved on words and marched from
the ground to our different quarters,

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,193
and that

65
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,320
is from a book called
recollections of Riflemen Harris,

66
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,230
who was an enlisted soldier for the
British army during the Napoleonic wars,

67
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:57,910
and that was his welcome to the army.

68
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,580
He'd been in for about three
weeks of service when he had to

69
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:04,850
okay,

70
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,270
stand and execute a fellow soldier

71
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,353
four

72
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,880
basically being drunk and disorderly,

73
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,420
not doing what he was supposed
to do. Brett, essentially,

74
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,270
he was being executed
for being a human being.

75
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,310
And that was the introduction to military
service for riflemen Harris Riflemen

76
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:33,370
Harris,
his full name was Benjamin Randall Harris.

77
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,700
He enlisted in 1803 he fought all
over Europe in the peninsular war,

78
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,630
which posed bourbon, Spain,
the Kingdom of Portugal,

79
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:51,631
and the British empire against Napoleon's
French empire and boat apart just

80
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,620
Spain.
And also the Duchy of Warsaw,

81
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,130
and this is a war

82
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,780
where they have daggers and swords and
Bay and nets and mounted cavalry charges.

83
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,990
They have cannons and they used
a lot of muzzle loading rifles,

84
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,490
which a skilled rifleman could load
and fire about three times per minute.

85
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,120
Hmm.
Accurate out to about 200 yards.

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,450
Very different from the
weapons that we have now,

87
00:06:29,451 --> 00:06:31,940
which can fire three rounds in a second

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,060
and are very accurate out to 800 yards,

89
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,600
a thousand yards and some sniper
weapons way further than that,

90
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,770
but even though these
weapons are different from
the weapons we see in modern

91
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:49,604
warfare.

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,380
Okay.

93
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,630
As always,
in the end it is men.

94
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,700
Yeah.

95
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,320
It is. Human beings on the
battlefield, bleeding, sweating,

96
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,070
starving, suffering, killing

97
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,520
and being killed.

98
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,260
Let's find out a little
bit more about rifleman.

99
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,450
Harris.
Going back to the book,

100
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,950
my father was a shepherd and I was a
sheep boy from my earliest youth. Indeed.

101
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,370
As soon as almost I could run,

102
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:34,480
I began helping my father to look after
the sheep on the downs of Branford

103
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,670
endorsed it. Sure. Where I was born.

104
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,640
Whilst I continued to tend the flocks and
herds under my charge and occasionally

105
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:46,570
in the long winter nights I
learned the art of making shoes.

106
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I grew a hardy little chap and was one
fine day in the year of 1802 drawn as a

107
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:57,760
soldier for the army of reserve.
Thus,

108
00:07:57,761 --> 00:08:02,761
without troubling myself much about the
change which was about to take place in

109
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,900
the quiet of my routine days,

110
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:10,140
I was drafted into the 66 the regiment
of foot bid good bye to my shepherd

111
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:15,820
companions and was obliged to leave my
father without an assistant to collect

112
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:20,821
his flocks just as he was beginning
more than ever to require one nay.

113
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,650
Indeed,
I may say,

114
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:28,651
to want tending and looking after
himself for old age and infirmary.

115
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,880
We're coming on him.

116
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,640
His hair was growing white as the
sleep of our downs and his countenance

117
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:41,530
becoming as furrowed as the
plowed fields around. However,

118
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,630
has I had no choice in the matter.

119
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,050
It was quite as well that I
did not grieve over my fate.

120
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,660
My father tried hard to buy me off and
would have persuaded the sergeant of the

121
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:57,661
66 that I was of no use as a soldier
from having maimed my right hand by

122
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,240
breaking the fourth
finger when I was a child.

123
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,650
The sergeant however said I was just the
sort of little chat he wanted and off

124
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:10,200
he went carrying me amongst
a batch of recruits.

125
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,850
He'd collected a way with him.

126
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,300
Yeah.

127
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Sheepherder Dad's getting
old army comes and gets you.

128
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,350
That's the way it works.
England 1802

129
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,830
now he travels around a little bit and
eventually ends up in Dublin and here we

130
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:44,001
go back to the bulk Walston Dublin I
one day saw core of the 95th rifles and

131
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:48,510
fell so in love with their smart dashing
and devil may care appearance that

132
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:53,250
nothing would serve me until I
was a rifleman myself. So on.

133
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:56,940
Arriving at Castle one day and falling
in with the recruiting party of that

134
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:01,260
regimen, I volunteered into the second
battalion, this recruiting party,

135
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:06,180
we're all Irishman and I had and had
been sent over from England to collect

136
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:07,110
amongst others,

137
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,070
men from the Irish militia and we're
just about to return to England.

138
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,490
I think they were as
reckless and devil may care.

139
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:19,140
A set of men I had ever been
beheld either before or since.

140
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,610
So these,

141
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:25,611
these riflemen I would say
from what I read about them,

142
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,920
they're,
they're almost like a special ops unit.

143
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,890
And one big difference is they're wearing,

144
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
instead of wearing red jackets like the,

145
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:36,720
the Brits would wear it
this time they wore green.

146
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,780
So they were a little bit different and
they had more accurate rifles and they

147
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:45,410
would fight, they would do what
they called skirmishing, which is,

148
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,160
is fundamentally cover move. They'd shoot
and they'd maneuver and they'd, they'd,

149
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
they'd act like little special
operations troops out there.

150
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,780
And of course it's interesting to me and
when I hear this guy talking about the

151
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:05,700
first time he saw someone that looked
a little bit like a special operations

152
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:10,320
troops, he said it. He actually
says, I fell in love with it.

153
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,600
You know, that's, that's very much how I
felt as I was growing up. The more I saw,

154
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,130
you know, the special ops,
he's, he actually didn't
even need to be special ops.

155
00:11:20,131 --> 00:11:22,290
For me.
It was just someone in the military,

156
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,020
but then he was already in the military.
So now he's looking for the next thing.

157
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,490
What's the next thing going to be?
And here he ends up as,

158
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:34,110
as a rifleman.
So he's now a right from an,

159
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:38,640
he joins, he moves over to their
regimen and here we go back to the book.

160
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:42,780
The next day we marched for Ashford and
Kent where I joined the 95th rifles and

161
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:46,170
about six months after my joining for
companies of the second battalion were

162
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,210
ordered on the expedition to Denmark.

163
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,780
We embarked it deal and sailing for
hostile shores landed on a little place

164
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,230
called I think scarlet island.

165
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,220
The expedition consisted of about 30,000
men and at the moment of our getting on

166
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:03,400
shore,

167
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,990
the whole force set up one
simultaneous and tremendous cheer.

168
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,590
A sound I cannot describe.
It seemed so inspiring.

169
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,250
This indeed was the
first time of my hearing,

170
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:18,880
the style in which our men give
tongue when they get near the enemy.

171
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,100
Though afterwards, my years became
pretty well accustomed to such sounds.

172
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,390
As soon as we got on shore, the
rifles were pushed, pushed forward,

173
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:31,700
and he says the rifles,
he's talking about his guys,

174
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,360
the rifles were pushed forward as the
advance in chain order through some thick

175
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,810
woods of for and when we had cleared
these woods and approached Copenhagen,

176
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,740
centuries were posted on the roads and
openings leading toward the town in order

177
00:12:45,741 --> 00:12:48,590
to intercept all comers
and prevent all supplies.

178
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:53,030
Such posts were occupied for about three
days and nights whilst the town was

179
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:54,830
being fired upon by our shipping.

180
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,440
I rather think this was the first time
of the con grieve rockets being brought

181
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:04,070
into play and they rushed through
the air and the dark. They appeared.

182
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:07,910
So like so many fiery serpents creating,
I should think,

183
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,990
terrible dismay among the besieged,
the con grieve rockets.

184
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,240
They basically look like
giant bottle rockets in a way.

185
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,280
[inaudible] they got at this time they
were getting their range out to 1500 2000

186
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:26,210
meters.
So it was a pretty crazy weapon and,

187
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,040
and I can tell you rockets in this day
and age have become fairly accurate,

188
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:35,090
but in those days they'd probably about
as accurate as a bottle rocket is.

189
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:39,320
My guests back to the book,
as the main army came up,

190
00:13:39,321 --> 00:13:43,610
we advanced and got as near under the
walls of the place as we could without

191
00:13:43,611 --> 00:13:45,860
being endangered by the
fire from our own shipping.

192
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,390
So what's happening right
there was covered move.

193
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,690
The shipping is bombarding and these
guys are advancing as close as they can

194
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,240
where they are not going
to get killed by their own,

195
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,250
by their own fire from the ships.

196
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,740
We now received orders
ourselves to commence firing
and the rattling of the guns,

197
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,300
I shall not easily forget.

198
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,150
I felt so much exhilarated that I could
hardly keep back and was checked by the

199
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:13,010
commander of the company who called me
by my name to keep my place about this

200
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,920
time,
my front rank man,

201
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,110
a tall fellow named Jack Johnson,

202
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:23,120
showed a disposition as though
the firing had an effect on him.

203
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:27,440
The reverse of what it had had on many
others of the company for he seemed

204
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,970
inclined to hang back and once
or twice turned round in my face,

205
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,160
I was a rear rank man and porting my
piece and the excitement of the moment I

206
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:41,300
score that if he did not keep his ground,
I would shoot him dead on the spot

207
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,810
so that he found it,

208
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,820
he would go on so that he found it would
be quite as dangerous for him to return

209
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,840
as to go on.

210
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,380
I feel sorry to record the
want of courage of this man,

211
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,970
but I do so with the less pain it gives
me the opportunity of saying that during

212
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:03,971
my many years of arduous service is the
only instance I remember of a British

213
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:08,570
soldier endeavoring to hold back when
his comrades were moving forward.

214
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,470
Indeed Johnson was never held again.

215
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:17,471
An estimation among the rifle core for
the story got wind that I had threatened

216
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:21,320
to shoot him for cowardice in the field
and Lieutenant Cox mentioned to the

217
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:26,270
kernel that he'd overheard my doing so
and such was the contempt the man was

218
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:30,890
held in by the rifles that he
was soon afterwards removed.

219
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,670
There you go. The first
time under fire, it's,

220
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,630
it's interesting how rifleman
Harris first time under fire,

221
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,080
he wants to get after it.

222
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,870
He is ready to charge and only one guy
out of their whole crew is looking like

223
00:15:48,871 --> 00:15:53,871
he's going to hold back and they
talk about reputation here and that's

224
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:58,260
definitely something that is when you get
to the seal teams, as you're a new guy,

225
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,350
someone tells you, they'll say,
hey, your reputation is everything.

226
00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:06,060
And it's totally true. And it's the
same in any military organization,

227
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:10,770
what your reputation is because,
because in the military,

228
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,660
you think ranks all
important, right? Yeah. But,

229
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:16,830
but the reality is there's something
that completely Trump's rank and that's

230
00:16:16,831 --> 00:16:20,550
reputation. And if you're, I mean,

231
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,730
I always talk about the
fact that relationships are
more important than chain of

232
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:24,540
command,

233
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,080
but you're not going to have
a good relationship with
people if you don't have a

234
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:31,080
good reputation. It's not
happening. Yeah. So it makes sense.

235
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,480
The same thing back in 1803,

236
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,363
yeah.

237
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,330
Back to the book. Whilst in Denmark
we led a tolerably active life.

238
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,390
The rifles being continually on the alert
ordered hither today and countermanded

239
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,670
the next occasionally.

240
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,760
Also we had some pleasant adventures
among the Blue Wide Danish lasses for the

241
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:58,720
rifles were always terrible
fellows in that way.

242
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,263
Okay.

243
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
That doesn't need too much explanation.

244
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,880
They,
I'll say this as I always say,

245
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,910
I have to fast forward through this book.
I'm not reading the entire book,

246
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:18,900
even though the entire book is awesome
in this point. This point here,

247
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,700
they're embarking for pers,
uh, Portugal. We have another,

248
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,970
another campaign to go
on back to the book.

249
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,600
I wish I could picture the splendid
site of the shipping and the downs.

250
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:36,250
At the time we embarked with about 20,000
men. Those were times which are sold,

251
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,290
which the soldiers of our own more
peaceable days have little conception of.

252
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,880
So this book was written
before World War One and,

253
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,230
and really this was the,

254
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:52,050
the last big war is the boards that
he went through the Napoleonic wars.

255
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,820
So he's kind of,
he's kind of saying,

256
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,100
you don't even know what this is like
anymore. You don't know what it is.

257
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:59,610
Like you don't know what the, the, the,

258
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,930
the soldiers of our own more peaceable
days have little conception of what it's

259
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:07,230
like to embark 20,000 troops
to get ready and go get some,

260
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,213
hmm.

261
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,571
Back to the book.

262
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:14,410
We sailed majestically out of the
cove of Cork for hostile sure.

263
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,480
Where we were safely arrived and
disembarked at Monday go bay.

264
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,380
The rifles were first out of the vessels
for we were indeed always in front of

265
00:18:25,931 --> 00:18:30,931
the advance and always in the rear in
retreat like the Kentish men of old,

266
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,970
we claimed the post of honor in the field.

267
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,210
I tried to figure out what that Kentish
man can't is obviously a place and and

268
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:44,401
the as far the best I could figure out
was that the people in Kent stood up

269
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:50,920
hardcore against the Norman invasion.
I think that's what that reference is too.

270
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,670
I'm sure somebody will correct
me and I hope somebody does.

271
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,320
Back to the bulk of being immediately
pushed forward up the country and advanced

272
00:18:59,321 --> 00:18:59,951
the main body.

273
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:04,060
Many of us in this hot climate very
soon began to find out the misery of the

274
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:04,960
frightful load.

275
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,950
We were condemned to march and fight
under with a burning sun above our heads

276
00:19:08,951 --> 00:19:12,340
and our feet sinking every
step into the hot sand.

277
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,370
The weight of the weight I myself toiled
under was tremendous and I often wonder

278
00:19:18,371 --> 00:19:22,660
at the strength I possessed at this
period that which enabled me to endure it

279
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,973
for indeed.

280
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,730
I'm convinced that many of our infantry
sank and died under the weight of their

281
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:28,900
knapsacks alone.

282
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,280
For my own part being a
handicraft handicraft,

283
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,200
I marched under the weight sufficient
to impede the free motions of a donkey

284
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,020
for besides my well filled kit, there
was the great coat rolled on its top,

285
00:19:44,021 --> 00:19:45,460
my blanket and camp cattle,

286
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:49,330
my haversack stuffed full of leather for
repairing the men's shoes together with

287
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:50,680
a hammer and other tools,

288
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,180
ship biscuit and beef for three days.

289
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,120
I also carried my canteen
filled with water,

290
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,740
my hatchet and rifle and 80 rounds
of ball cartridge in my pouch.

291
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,210
This last,

292
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,300
except the beef and biscuit being the
best thing I owned and which I always gave

293
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:13,150
the enemy the benefit of
when the opportunity offered.

294
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,571
It's interesting,

295
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:21,571
he knew how to work on shoes and so he
carries stuff to repair shoes in the

296
00:20:21,611 --> 00:20:25,480
field. Mm Eight think about that.
That's just a lost art, isn't it?

297
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,340
But think about where you are in the field
when you have to March 15 miles a day

298
00:20:30,341 --> 00:20:34,450
and you have no shoes. If there's
someone that can fix your shoes, that's,

299
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,470
that's a godsend. Yeah. Back
to the book the next day.

300
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:42,850
We again advanced and being in a state
of the utmost anxiety to come up along

301
00:20:42,851 --> 00:20:47,080
the French, neither the heat of the
burning sun, long miles or heavy,

302
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,040
we're able to diminish our Arbor.
Indeed.

303
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,610
I often look back with wonder
at the light hearted style,

304
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:59,740
the agility and the reckless indifference
with which men who were so destined in

305
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,750
short time to fall,
hurry,

306
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:06,340
dawn words toward the field of strife
seemingly without a thought of anything

307
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:10,270
but the sheer love of meeting the
Foa and the excitement of battle.

308
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,770
He wrote this book

309
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,830
20 something years after this happened.
After this experience.

310
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:27,250
I want to say he wrote it
in 1930 something 1938 maybe
is when it came out and

311
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,450
you can see that the so,

312
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:40,430
so my point in saying that is that
looking back he knows because he's, he's,

313
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,020
he's going,
he's going to go through hell.

314
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,760
He's going to go through hardcore combat.

315
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,260
But even even knowing
how horrible combat is,

316
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,060
he still looks back in,
is,

317
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,350
is amazed at how they were ready to go.

318
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,720
Going back to the book. The 29th regiment
received so terrible a fire that I saw,

319
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:02,690
the right wing almost
annihilated and the colonel,

320
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:05,570
I think his name was Lennox
lay sprawling amongst the rest.

321
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:11,620
We had caught ourselves in it pretty
handsomely for there was no cover for us

322
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,070
and we were rather to near
the living skirmishers.

323
00:22:16,071 --> 00:22:18,770
We're laying beside
heaps of their own dead,

324
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,330
but still we had her own till
the battalion regiments come up.

325
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,440
Fire and retire is a very good sound,

326
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,770
but the rifles were not
over fond of such notes.

327
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,540
We never performed that maneuver except
when it was made pretty plain to us that

328
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:38,510
it was quite necessary.
The 29th however,

329
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,460
had got their fairing hair at this time
and the shock of that fire seemed to

330
00:22:43,461 --> 00:22:45,740
stagger the whole line
and make them recoil.

331
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,430
At the moment a little
confusion appeared in the ranks.

332
00:22:49,431 --> 00:22:54,350
I thought Lord Hill was near at hand
and saw it and I observed him come

333
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:55,280
galloping up.

334
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,880
He put himself at the head of the
regimen and restored them to order.

335
00:22:58,881 --> 00:23:01,760
In a moment. There's some leadership
just full on leadership and action.

336
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,990
So there's also fire and retire.
What that means is covered move.

337
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,590
So you have some people shooting
and some people falling back.

338
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:12,680
That's how they retreat and there they
use that whenever they have to retreat,

339
00:23:12,681 --> 00:23:16,550
you'll hear that and in, I dunno if
I did this, made this clear enough,

340
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,800
but it's a bugle.
It's a bugle signal.

341
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,950
So the bugle would play some certain
number of notes or some pattern of notes

342
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:26,980
and p and everyone would know,
okay, that means firing, retire.

343
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:30,380
So now we're now we get that broad,
that broad.

344
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,783
Yeah,

345
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,890
the broad plan out to everyone at once,
which is instead of advancing,

346
00:23:36,891 --> 00:23:39,140
which is what we were doing,
now we're going to,

347
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,410
we're going to retreat and as soon
as you get everyone that information,

348
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:45,020
now little elements can start to
make it happen. That's decentralized,

349
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,990
but you have to give good communications
in order for that to work.

350
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,460
And what you need to communicate is the
broad plan and that's what they get done

351
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:53,750
with a nice little bugle signal

352
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:59,060
back to the book pouring or regular
and sharp fire upon the enemy.

353
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,830
He galled them in return and remaining
with the 29th until he brought them to

354
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:07,910
the charge.
Quickly sent the foe in the right about,

355
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:12,380
it seemed to me that few men could
have conducted the business with more

356
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:17,381
coolness and quietude of manner under
such as storm of balls as he was exposed

357
00:24:18,111 --> 00:24:22,370
to. Indeed. I have never
forgotten him from that day.

358
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,850
So yeah, it's important to
also recognize that you have a,

359
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,020
you have a group of men that are about
to fall apart and there's confusion.

360
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,140
And one guy,
I talk about this all the time,

361
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,120
one guy steps up,
takes ownership of the situation leads,

362
00:24:38,121 --> 00:24:41,600
and it changes the entire outcome of
the battle. Think about that one person.

363
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,490
You got thousand men versus a thousand
men. One person makes the difference.

364
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,650
So if you're in a leadership position,
think about that.

365
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,860
Thinking about what you're doing,
are you leading? Are you stepping up?

366
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,340
Are you galloping up on a
horse and setting things right?

367
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,530
Do you need to be doing
back to the book?

368
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,750
At the time I was remarking these matters,

369
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,420
loading and firing as I
lay another circumstance,

370
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:09,530
divided my attention for a while and made
me forget even the gallant conduct of

371
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:10,364
General Hill,

372
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,230
a man near me uttered a scream of agony
and looking from the 29th who were on my

373
00:25:16,251 --> 00:25:19,070
right to the left once
the screen should come,

374
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:23,690
I saw one of our sergeants named Frazier
sitting in a doubled up position and

375
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:28,691
swing backwards and forwards as though
he had got a terrible pain in his bowels.

376
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,110
He continued to make such complaint
that I arose and went to him for.

377
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:39,800
He was rather a crony of mine.
Oh Harris said he,

378
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:43,070
as I took him in my arms,
I shall die. I shall die.

379
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,410
The agony is so great
that I cannot bear it,

380
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:46,770
okay.

381
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,350
It was indeed dreadful to look upon him.

382
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,210
The froth came from his mouth and the
perspiration poured from his face.

383
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,423
Thank heaven.

384
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,410
He was soon out of pain
can laying him down.

385
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,280
I returned to my place.
Poor fellow.

386
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,610
He suffered more for a short time
that he was dying than any man.

387
00:26:08,611 --> 00:26:11,130
I think I ever saw him in
the same circumstances.

388
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,630
I had the courtesy to return and
look at him after the battle.

389
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:21,830
The Musket ball I found had taken him
sideways and gone through both groins.

390
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,320
Okay.

391
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,420
Within about a half an hour after this,

392
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I left sergeant Frazier and indeed for
the time how'd as completely forgotten

393
00:26:33,351 --> 00:26:36,020
him as if he had died
a hundred years back.

394
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,080
The site of so much bloodshed around
will not suffer the mind to dwell long in

395
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:43,710
any particular casualty.

396
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,490
Even though it happened
to one's dearest friends.

397
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,650
There was no time either to
think for all was action with us.

398
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:57,651
Rifles just at this moment and the barrel
of my peace was so hot from continual

399
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:03,150
firing that I could hardly bear to touch
it and was obliged to grasp the stock

400
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:06,360
beneath the iron as I
continued to blaze away.

401
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,313
Okay.

402
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:14,940
Doesn't even have time to think about it.
Yeah.

403
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,420
James Ponton was another crony of mine,
a gallon fellow.

404
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:26,470
He had pushed himself in front of me
and was checked by one of our officers,

405
00:27:26,471 --> 00:27:29,800
rap for his rashness.
Keep back, you Ponton.

406
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,130
The lieutenant said to him more than once,

407
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,290
but Pontin was to be restrained by Ponton
was not to be restrained by anything,

408
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:41,710
but a bullet went in action this time.

409
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:45,580
He got one which striking
him in the thigh, I suppose,

410
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,920
hit an artery for,
he died quickly.

411
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,690
The French man's balls were flying very
wickedly at that moment and I crept up

412
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:58,400
to Ponton and took shelter by lying
behind and making a rest from my rifle of

413
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:59,330
his dead body.

414
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:00,800
Okay.

415
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:05,330
It strikes me that I revenged his
death by the assistance of his carcass.

416
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:06,680
Okay.

417
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,620
At any rate,
I tried my best to hit his enemies hard.

418
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:14,810
There were two small buildings to our
front and the French having managed to get

419
00:28:14,811 --> 00:28:16,910
into them,
annoyed as much from that quarter.

420
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,990
A small rise in the ground closed before
these houses also favored them and our

421
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:26,540
men were being handled very severely.
In consequence,

422
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,010
they became angry and
wouldn't stand it any longer.

423
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,110
One of the skirmishers jumping off,
rushed forward crying over boys over,

424
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:38,630
over.
When he instantly,

425
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:43,190
when instantly the whole line
responded to the cry over, over,

426
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:46,520
over.
They ran along the grass like wildfire,

427
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,610
then dash at the rise fixing their sword
bayonets as they ran the French light.

428
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:56,951
Bob's could not stand the sight but turned
about and fled and getting possession

429
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,440
of their ground.
We were soon inside the buildings.

430
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,490
After the battle was over,
I stepped across the other house.

431
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,350
I have mentioned in order to see what
was going on there for the one I remained

432
00:29:09,351 --> 00:29:13,400
in was now pretty well filled with
the wounded, both French and English,

433
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,950
who had managed to get
there for a little shelter.

434
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:22,090
Two or three surgeons also had arrived
at this house and we're busily engaged in

435
00:29:22,281 --> 00:29:25,370
giving their assistance to the wounded.
Now also here,

436
00:29:25,371 --> 00:29:28,190
lying is thickly as in the building,
which I had left,

437
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,290
but what struck me the most,

438
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,080
but what struck me the most forcibly was
that from the circumstance of some wine

439
00:29:36,081 --> 00:29:39,890
bots having been left in the apartment
and having their engagement been

440
00:29:39,891 --> 00:29:40,724
perforated,

441
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,500
having in the engagement been perforated
by bullets and otherwise broken,

442
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,690
the red wine had escaped most plentiful
and ran down upon the earth and floor

443
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,010
where the wounded were lying so that
many of them were soaked in the wine with

444
00:29:54,011 --> 00:29:55,810
which their blood was mingled.

445
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:01,350
Okay.

446
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,290
Aye. Aye. Aye.

447
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,800
I hate to even think about the medical
care that these guys are getting.

448
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,470
Yeah.
In any the Ma,

449
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,130
the medical care that that we
had in Iraq was unbelievable.

450
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,560
Not only from the speed that
you would get assistance,

451
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,590
but also the quality of care that you
would get on in the field from our own

452
00:30:26,171 --> 00:30:31,171
medics and how quickly they would get
you to get to you and then get you taken

453
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,680
care of, I think get you evacuated
to a full medical facility. Yeah.

454
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:36,420
Yeah.

455
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,680
And that, that actually changed during
my time in the teams. For instance,

456
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,540
the biggest, the biggest change it
when, when I first gotten the teams,

457
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,630
it, the, what we were taught
was if someone gets shot,

458
00:30:48,631 --> 00:30:51,150
you immediately give them an ivy,
meaning you know,

459
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:54,210
a bag of fluid because they're bleeding.
You got to replace that.

460
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,120
And now the,

461
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,360
they don't do that automatically because
your body has its own mechanisms.

462
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,110
When it loses blood to stop the bleeding,
it pulls back in the,

463
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:12,111
the arteries and veins and it constricts
them and clots the blood that's there.

464
00:31:12,931 --> 00:31:17,490
And so, and when you give someone an ivy,
the body thinks I don't need to do that.

465
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:20,580
So it opens up the arteries, it opens up
the veins, it doesn't constrict anything.

466
00:31:20,581 --> 00:31:22,260
It doesn't get clots slower.

467
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,250
So there's like one example
and that that's during my time.

468
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,230
So that's the last 25 years
that that change has taken
place. So now you go back,

469
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:36,000
you know, 102 hundred years,
it's totally different.

470
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,260
Totally different. And they'll talk
more about that. And the, the basic,

471
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,510
the basic plan was if you get shot in
the limb, you're losing the limb. Yeah.

472
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,660
That. That's basically what's
going on. Just amputations

473
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,490
Kinda and nowadays they do
an incredible job of saving,

474
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,540
saving limbs if they can be saved,
they saved them.

475
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,950
I mean they do an incredible job.
All right,

476
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:03,730
back to the book,

477
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,260
it was on the 15th of August when we
first came up with the French and their

478
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:13,261
skirmishers immediately
commenced operations by
raiding a shower of balls upon

479
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,520
us as we advanced, which we
returned without delay, and
I haven't said this yet,

480
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,160
but the reason they're saying balls
instead of round is because these guys are

481
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:22,700
shooting the balls,

482
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:27,800
the round balls of led and at this point
there was some rifling had started to

483
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:32,570
come about, but what they basically
just consider everything to be a ball,

484
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,510
a lead and that's why
they're not accurate.

485
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:38,230
That's why they're only accurate out to
200 meters because they're not rifled

486
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,900
like we have the tight rifling
spinning bullets today.

487
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,780
Back to the book, the first man
that was hit was Lieutenant Bunbury.

488
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,880
He fell pierce through the head with a
musket ball and died almost immediately.

489
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,550
Okay.

490
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:54,941
I fought.

491
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:59,020
I never heard such a tremendous noise
as the firing made on this occasion and

492
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:03,280
the men on both sides of me.
I could occasionally observe.

493
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,750
We're falling fast.

494
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:11,230
I do not pretend to give a description
of this or any other battle I have been

495
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:12,064
present at.

496
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,960
All I can do is tell the things which
happened immediately around me and that I

497
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:20,500
think is as much as a private
soldier can be expected to do.

498
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:21,840
Okay.

499
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,930
Soon afterwards,
the firing commenced and we had taken,

500
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,670
we had advanced pretty close upon the
enemy taking advantage of whatever cover I

501
00:33:29,671 --> 00:33:30,480
could find.

502
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,250
I threw myself behind a small bank
where I lay so secure that although the

503
00:33:35,251 --> 00:33:37,800
Frenchmans bullets fell
pretty thickly around,

504
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,820
I was enabled to knock several
over without being dislodged.

505
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,163
In fact,

506
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,590
I fired away every round I had in my pouch
waltzed laying in this spot at length

507
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:51,450
after a sharp contest.

508
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,080
We forced them to give
ground and following them up,

509
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,760
drove them from their position in the
heights and hung up their skirts until

510
00:33:59,761 --> 00:34:03,420
they made another stand and
then the game began again.

511
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:04,840
Okay.

512
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,310
The rifles indeed fought well
this day and we lost many men.

513
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,620
They seemed in high spirits and delighted
at having driven the enemy before them.

514
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,970
Joseph coach and was by my side loading
and firing very industriously about this

515
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:25,540
period of the day.
First thing with heat and action,

516
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:28,960
he lifted his canteen to his
mouth. Here's to you, old boy,

517
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,450
he said is he took a pullet its contents.

518
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,380
Okay.

519
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,090
As he did so a bullet went through
the canteen and perforated his brain,

520
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,740
killing him in a moment,

521
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:39,730
okay.

522
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,350
Another man fell close to him,
almost immediately struck,

523
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,760
struck by a ball in the thigh,

524
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:47,530
okay.

525
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:52,530
I saw a man named Simmons struck full in
the face by around shot and he came to

526
00:34:53,321 --> 00:34:55,480
the ground,
a headless trunk.

527
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,313
Okay.

528
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,840
When the role was called after the battle,

529
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,430
the females who missed their husbands
came along the front of the line to

530
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:11,060
inquire of the survivors,
whether they knew anything about them so

531
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,330
the wives could travel with the soldiers.
And again,

532
00:35:17,331 --> 00:35:19,850
that just seems crazy to me right now.
But that's,

533
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,720
that's the way they did it
and not all of them. But if,

534
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:27,560
if they made that decision,
I guess as a family to stick together,

535
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,170
they'd get right on board the boats
and they'd, they'd March, they marched,

536
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:35,900
they cover it in this book, they'll get
there, they wouldn't carry the weight,

537
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:40,930
but they'd marched alongside and go from
place to place and when the battle is

538
00:35:41,161 --> 00:35:44,370
about to take place, they'd hang
back and then you have the situation.

539
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:48,540
Once the battles over that I'm talking
about right now amongst other names,

540
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:54,110
I heard that if coach and called and a
female voice without being replied to the

541
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:58,080
name struck me and I observed the poor
woman who had called it, as she said,

542
00:35:58,081 --> 00:35:58,800
stopping,

543
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,880
sobbing before us and apparently afraid
to make further inquiries about her

544
00:36:02,881 --> 00:36:03,714
husband.

545
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,400
No Man had answered to his name or had
any given account to give of his fate.

546
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:14,960
I myself had observed him fall as
related before whilst drinking from his

547
00:36:14,961 --> 00:36:19,250
canteen, but as I looked at the
poor sobbing creature before me,

548
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:24,180
I felt unable to tell her
of his death at length.

549
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:27,720
Captain Leach observed her
and called out to the company.

550
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,050
Does any man know what has
happened to coach and if so,

551
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:34,390
let him speak out at once upon this order,

552
00:36:34,391 --> 00:36:39,391
I immediately related what I had seen
and told the manner of his death after a

553
00:36:39,661 --> 00:36:43,870
while and this coat Mrs.
Coach and appeared anxious
to seek the spot where her

554
00:36:43,871 --> 00:36:48,130
husband fell and in the hope of still
finding him alive asked me to accompany

555
00:36:48,131 --> 00:36:49,180
her over the field.

556
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,050
She trusted not withstanding what I
had told her to find him yet alive.

557
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,230
Okay.

558
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,520
Do you think you could find it said
Captain Leech upon being referred to?

559
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,610
I told them I was sure I could.
As I had remarked,

560
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:09,260
many objects waltzed looking for cover
during the skirmishing go then said the

561
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:13,970
captain and show the poor woman this
spot as she seems so desirous of finding

562
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:14,804
the body.

563
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,150
Okay.

564
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,160
I accordingly took my way over the ground.

565
00:37:18,161 --> 00:37:23,161
We had fought upon she following and
sobbing after me quickly reaching the spot

566
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:26,200
where her husband's body
lay pointed out to her.

567
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,620
Yeah,

568
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,820
she now discovered soon
all her hopes were in vain.

569
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,480
She embraced a stiffened corpse and after
rising and contemplating his disbelief,

570
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:42,550
disfigured face for some minutes with
hands clasped and tears streaming down her

571
00:37:43,281 --> 00:37:47,870
cheeks, she took a prayer book
from her pocket and kneeling down,

572
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,140
repeated this service for
the dead over the body.

573
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:53,853
Poor woman,

574
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,950
I pitied her much,
but there was no remedy.

575
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,270
Okay.

576
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,800
Whole new dynamic right there.

577
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,393
Hmm.

578
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,750
Continuing on back to the book,

579
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:17,910
it was on the 21st of August that we
commenced fighting the battle of Ramiro.

580
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,940
The French came down upon us as a column
and the rifleman immediately commenced

581
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:27,870
a sharp fire upon them from whatever cover
they could get a shelter behind while

582
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:30,270
star Canon played upon them from our rear.

583
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:35,340
I saw a regular little lanes torn
through their ranks as they advanced,

584
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,100
which were

585
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,310
immediately closed up again
as they march steadily on.

586
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,570
Whenever we saw a round shot,
thus go through the mass,

587
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,190
we raised a shout of delight.
That's a savage image,

588
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,850
right there.

589
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,500
Ranks of men and there's cannon balls
that are cutting lines through cutting

590
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,330
lanes through them and you,

591
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,360
you'd probably talking 2030 people killed
each one and the ranks just close in

592
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:05,650
around them and that's what these guys
are seeing is this advanced takes place

593
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,860
there. Continue through that battle. They
get into a position for another battle.

594
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,360
Going back to the book,

595
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:16,750
as I looked about me whilst standing
and ranked and just thought,

596
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,660
and just before the commencement
commencement of the battle,

597
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:24,870
I thought it the most imposing site the
world could produce our lines glittering

598
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,280
with bright arms,

599
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,800
the stern features of the men as they
stood with their eyes fixed on alternately

600
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,860
upon the enemy,

601
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:37,270
the proud colors of England floating over
the heads of the different battalions

602
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,510
and the dark cannon on the rising ground
and all in readiness to commence the

603
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,970
awful work of deaf with a noise that
would defin the whole multitude.

604
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,100
Although the site had a singular and
terrible effect upon the feelings of a

605
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:59,101
youth who a few short months before had
been a solitary shepard upon the downs

606
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:05,101
of Dorsal pitcher and had
never contemplated any
other sort of life than the

607
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:10,681
peaceful occupation of watching the
innocent sheep as they fed upon the grassy

608
00:40:10,961 --> 00:40:15,100
turf.
Talk about a dichotomy.

609
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
No fought in his mind other
than watching sheep eat grass.

610
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:27,030
I would think that that'd be kind
of a good little escape, you know,

611
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,200
from time to time to notice
those types of things. Yes,

612
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:35,270
I think you're right. And I
think that happens in, you know,

613
00:40:35,271 --> 00:40:40,271
there's a movie called the thin red line
and that's portrayed very well in all

614
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,401
this chaos.

615
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:47,080
He'll take cover and he'll be face to
face with a flower or he'll notice a

616
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,940
burger, a bug. And that's definitely,

617
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,790
that's definitely something
that people notice.

618
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:55,720
I mean I noticed there's the sunset
no matter where you are in the world.

619
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,710
And actually the sunset and the deserts
have very beautiful thing and same with

620
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:00,544
the sunrise.

621
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:05,380
And so those are little things that you
notice even though you might not be in

622
00:41:05,381 --> 00:41:07,840
the mindset to notice them,
you still notice them.

623
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,870
Back to the book,
the battle commencing immediately.

624
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,570
We were all soon so hard at work,

625
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,630
the rifles as usual or
pretty busy in this battle.

626
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,730
The French in great numbers came steadily
down upon us and we pelted away upon

627
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,140
them like a shower of led.

628
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,730
Inhale under any cover we
could find in lay firing.

629
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:34,100
One moment, jumping up and
running for it. The next and

630
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,510
when we could see before us,

631
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,830
we observe the cannon balls making a
lane through the enemy's columns as they

632
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:44,831
advanced as they were [inaudible]
and shouting like mad men.

633
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:48,560
Okay.

634
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,630
The battle soon became general,

635
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,840
the smoke thick into round and often I
was obliged to stop firing and dash at

636
00:41:56,091 --> 00:42:00,320
aside from my face and try in vain to
get a sight of what was going on whilst

637
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:05,090
groans and shouts and annoys of candidate
and musketry appeared almost to shake

638
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,170
the very ground.

639
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,530
Yeah.

640
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,750
It seemed hell upon,

641
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:13,770
or if I thought a man named John Lowe
stood before me at this moment and he

642
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:19,500
turned around during a pause in our
exertions that he addressed me. Harris,

643
00:42:19,501 --> 00:42:22,950
you humbug. He said you've
got plenty of money about you.

644
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:26,640
I know for you to always staying about
and picking up what you can find on the

645
00:42:26,641 --> 00:42:30,540
field, but I think this will
be your last field day old boy.

646
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,240
A good many of us will catch it,
I suspect today.

647
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,360
Okay,

648
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,141
you're right.
Low.

649
00:42:35,141 --> 00:42:40,141
I said I've got nine guineas in my pack
and if I am shocked today and you escape

650
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:45,370
yourself, it's quite at your
service. In the meantime,

651
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:46,204
however,

652
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,410
if you see any symptoms of my
wishing to flinch in this business,

653
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:53,410
I hope you will shoot
me with your own hand.

654
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,640
Yeah,

655
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:59,480
blow Pitsa the, so let's think about
that. That's, that's pretty awesome.

656
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,430
First of all, the attitude
of they're basically talking
smack to each other. Yeah.

657
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,500
Classic. Hey, I don't
think you're gonna make it.

658
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,830
I know you got a lot of money on you and
if you don't make it, what do you say?

659
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,540
Is that mine? Yes. If I die, come and
get it. I got nine guineas and my pack.

660
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:18,080
They're all years and then
this is classic by the way,

661
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:23,020
if you see me acting cowardly in
any way, you better shoot me. Yeah,

662
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:24,363
that's a legit

663
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:29,510
low as well as myself survived
this battle and after it was over,

664
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:33,680
whilst we sat down with our comrades
and rested amongst other matters,

665
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,420
talked over low,

666
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:38,980
told them of our conversation during
the heat of the day and the money I'd

667
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:42,890
collected and the rifles from that time
to time had a great respect from me.

668
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:48,550
It is indeed singular how a man loses
or gains cast with his comrades from the

669
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:53,630
behavior and how closely he is. He is
observed on the battlefield. Again,

670
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,250
talking about reputation.
Once again,

671
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:02,750
the officers to our commented
upon and closely observed.

672
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,640
Everyone's watching the officers.

673
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,710
The men are very proud of those who
are brave in the field and kind and

674
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:11,840
considerate to the
soldiers and under them.

675
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:19,200
An act of kindness done by an officer
has often during battle been the cause of

676
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:23,870
his life being saved, got a
little relationship going. Hmm.

677
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,240
Nay.
Whatever folks may say upon the matter.

678
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:31,120
I know from experience that in our army,

679
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,770
the men liked best to
be officer by gentlemen,

680
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,030
men who's education has rendered
them more kind in manners.

681
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:44,270
Then your course officer sprung from
obscure origin and who style is brutal and

682
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:48,450
overbearing.
So as I was reading through that,

683
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:53,280
I at first I, I kinda got a little
bit taken aback because I said, oh,

684
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:56,430
what are you trying to say if you haven't
been to college or a year that that's

685
00:44:56,431 --> 00:45:00,160
what you need. You need to be from this
good upbringing. But that's not well that,

686
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,680
that might be what he's
saying at that time.

687
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,370
But the important part is
it's how you treat people.

688
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,080
It doesn't matter what background
you came from, you know, he,

689
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:11,820
he says men who's education has
rendered them more kind of manners.

690
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:15,300
And rather than someone that's from a,
an obscure origin,

691
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:17,850
what I'm telling you is it
doesn't matter where you're from.

692
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:22,500
And he would agree with this. Now if
he was here to talk with me, of course,

693
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,430
but it's not.

694
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,650
He's talking about the p the men like
to work for officers that aren't brutal

695
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:33,420
and overbearing. No one likes that.
Yeah, and you don't perform well.

696
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,020
You want to build the
relationship with your troops.

697
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,430
The kindness done by an officer as often
during the battle been the cause of his

698
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:44,250
life being saved.
That means guys are trying to win.

699
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,213
Yeah.

700
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,930
Back to the book and let me bear testimony
to the courage and endurance of the,

701
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,000
of that army under trials and hardships,

702
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,020
such as few armies in any
age I should think, endured.

703
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,990
I've seen officers and men hobbling
forward with tears in their eyes from the

704
00:46:06,991 --> 00:46:08,490
misery of long miles,

705
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:13,440
empty stomachs and ragged backs without
even shoes or stockings on their

706
00:46:13,441 --> 00:46:14,460
bleeding feet.

707
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,870
And it was not a little thing that
would bring a tear into the eyes of a

708
00:46:18,871 --> 00:46:23,871
rifleman of the peninsula wars youths
who had not long been removed from their

709
00:46:25,411 --> 00:46:30,411
parents' home and care officers and men
have borne hardships and privations such

710
00:46:32,491 --> 00:46:37,110
as in are more peaceful days.
We have little conception of

711
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,400
okay,

712
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,400
and yet these men faint and weary with
toil would brighten up in a moment when

713
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:48,810
the word ran amongst us that
the enemy we're at hand.

714
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,990
Once again, he's ragging on you
haven't really been to war lately.

715
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,650
Peaceful days and

716
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:01,783
brutal

717
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,600
privations that these guys go through
and yet they're still ready to step up.

718
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,020
Back to the book.
It was just at the close of the battle.

719
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,550
The dreadful turmoil and noise of the
engagement had hardly subsided and I began

720
00:47:13,551 --> 00:47:16,970
to look at the faces of the men close
around me to see who had escaped the

721
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:18,110
dangers of the hour.

722
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,170
I saw that the ranks of the
rifleman looked very thin.

723
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,190
It seemed to me that
one half had gone down.

724
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:27,800
Okay.

725
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,440
We had four companies with fifth and
we're commanded that day by major Travers.

726
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,570
He was a man much liked by the men of
the rifles and indeed deservedly beloved

727
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:41,200
by all who knew him.
He was a tight hand,

728
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,340
but a soldier likes that
better than a slovenly officer.

729
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,850
Pay attention to that one.
Don't be a Slovenly leader.

730
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,380
They the troops prefer the tight hand.
Back to the book.

731
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:58,510
I'd observed him more
than once during this day,

732
00:47:58,511 --> 00:48:02,170
spring here and they're keeping the men
well up and apparently in the highest

733
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:05,890
spirits he could not have
enjoyed himself more.

734
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:10,750
I am sure if he had been at a horse
race or following a good pack of hounds.

735
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,790
The battle is just over. A flag of truce
came from, came over from the French.

736
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,050
We threw ourselves down when we
were standing. When the fire ceased,

737
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:24,130
a Frenchman Lake close beside me,
he was dying and called to me for water,

738
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:28,270
which I understood him to require
more from his manner that his words.

739
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:29,830
Yeah,

740
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:34,830
I need not say that I got up and gave
it to him whilst I did so down Gallup,

741
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:37,070
the major in front Justin,

742
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,600
the same good spirits he'd
been in all day plugging along,

743
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:45,460
avoiding with some little difficulty, the
dead and dying, which were strewn about.

744
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:46,950
Okay.

745
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,880
He was never a very good looking man,
being hard featured and thin,

746
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,060
a hatchet face man as we used to say,

747
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:59,040
but he was irregular Gooden,
a real English soldier,

748
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,020
and that's better than if he had been
the handsomest ladies man in the army.

749
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:07,503
Legit,

750
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:11,890
totally legit.

751
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:16,840
Back to the book of French, a French
soldier was lying beside me at this time.

752
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,540
He was badly wounded in
hearing him Moen as he lay.

753
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,610
After I had done looking at the cavalry,

754
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,860
I turned my attention
to him and getting up,

755
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:28,480
lifted his head and poured some water
into his mouth. He was dying fast,

756
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,340
but he thanked me in a foreign language,

757
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:34,120
which although I did not
exactly understand, I could
easily make out by the look.

758
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:39,121
He gave me Mullins of the rifles who
stepped up whilst I supported his head.

759
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,590
Dammed me for a fool,
for my pain's better.

760
00:49:44,591 --> 00:49:49,000
Knock out his brain's Harris.
He said he's done os mischief enough.

761
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,550
I'll be bound for it today.

762
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,030
So right from the Harris is
still a pretty sympathetic dude.

763
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,073
Hmm.

764
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,730
Back to the book towards evening I posted
upon arising ground amongst a clump of

765
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:07,820
tall trees.
There seem to have been a sharp skirmish.

766
00:50:07,821 --> 00:50:11,750
Here is three French men were lying dead
amongst the long grass upon the spot

767
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:12,650
where I was standing,

768
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:16,100
as I threw my rifle to my shoulder
and walked past them on my beat,

769
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:20,990
I observed they had been plundered and
there have her sacs having been torn off.

770
00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:23,090
Some of the contents were scattered about

771
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:28,400
war is a sad blunter of the feelings.

772
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:33,610
I have often thought since those days
the contemplation of three ghastly bodies

773
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:39,290
in this lonely spot failed then in
making the slightest impression upon me,

774
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:44,660
the site had become even in the short
time I had been engaged in the trade,

775
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,790
but too familiar

776
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:54,070
and now they're another truce kind of
happens and he's observing the scene in

777
00:50:57,261 --> 00:51:01,070
this churchyard. The scene in this
church yard was somewhat singular.

778
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:05,340
Two long tables had been procured from
some houses near and were placed end to

779
00:51:05,341 --> 00:51:09,590
and amongst the graves and upon them we
laid the men who's limbs it was found

780
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:13,190
necessary to amputate
both French and English.

781
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,520
We're constantly lifted
on and off these tables.

782
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:20,210
As soon as the operation
was performed upon one lot,

783
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:24,800
they were carried off and in. In those
waiting behind, we're always stood up.

784
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,870
The surgeons with their sleeves turned
up and their hands and arms covered in

785
00:51:29,871 --> 00:51:33,260
blood looking like
butchers in the shambles.

786
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:34,700
Okay?

787
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:38,120
I saw as I passed,
at least 20 legs lying on the ground.

788
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:43,040
Many of them being clothed in the long
black gators then worn by the infantry

789
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:43,874
line.

790
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:44,620
Okay.

791
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:49,210
The surgeons had plenty of work on hand
that day and not having the time to take

792
00:51:49,211 --> 00:51:50,650
the clothes off the wounded.

793
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:55,360
They merely rip the seams and turn the
cough back proceeding with the operation

794
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:56,590
as fast as they could.

795
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:58,640
Okay.

796
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,060
Many of the wounded came straggling
into this church yard and search of

797
00:52:02,061 --> 00:52:03,530
assistance by themselves.

798
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,600
I saw one man faint with Ross of blood
staggering along and turned to assist

799
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:09,434
him.

800
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:10,110
Okay.

801
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,850
He was severely wounded in the head.

802
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,820
His face being completely
encrusted with blood,

803
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,130
which had flowing during the night.

804
00:52:17,131 --> 00:52:22,131
Now dried one eyeball was knocked out
of the socket and hung down upon his

805
00:52:22,741 --> 00:52:23,574
cheek.

806
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:24,760
Okay.

807
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,780
But another man I observed who had been
brought in and propped up against a

808
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:32,110
grave mound,
he seemed very badly hurt.

809
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,920
The men who had carried him into
the church yard had placed his cap,

810
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:40,640
filled with the fragments of biscuit
close beside his head and he lay and the

811
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,730
and occasionally turned
his mouth towards it.

812
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,220
Got a hold of a piece of
biscuit and munched it.

813
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,170
Okay.

814
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:50,170
As I was about to leave the
church yard doctor Ridgeway,

815
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,100
one of the surgeons called me back
to assist with holding a man he was

816
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,840
endeavoring to operate upon.

817
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,530
Okay.

818
00:52:57,530 --> 00:52:58,760
Come and help me with this man.

819
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:02,360
He said where I shall be all day
cutting a ball out of his shoulder.

820
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,150
Yeah.

821
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,490
The patient's name was doubter,
an Irishman.

822
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:11,320
He disliked the doctor's efforts and
writhed and twisted so much during the

823
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:15,280
operation that it was with difficulty.
Doctor Ridgeway could perform it.

824
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:16,600
Okay.

825
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,310
He found it necessary to cut very deep
and doubter made a terrible outcry at

826
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:25,500
every fresh incision. Oh,
doctor dear doctor said,

827
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:30,000
it's murdering me. You are
blood and hounds, I shall die.

828
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:33,570
I shall die for the love of the Lord.
Don't cut me all to pieces.

829
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,880
Doubter was not altogether wrong for
although he survived the operation,

830
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:45,780
he died shortly thereafter
from the effects of his wounds.

831
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,640
Okay.

832
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,473
Again,

833
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,540
you just got surgeons mixing blood
and not clean and not even cutting off

834
00:53:56,871 --> 00:53:58,520
clothes or sterilizing.
I mean the,

835
00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:02,660
the amount of people that must have lost
from the infections after the fact is

836
00:54:02,661 --> 00:54:06,290
just
crazy

837
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:09,761
now.

838
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:14,761
They weren't fighting all the time and
at this point they are quartered in a

839
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:17,060
house in Spain.
And again,

840
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:20,950
Spain was divided at the time and there
was friendly and enemy span Spain.

841
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:26,170
And so they're quartered in a
house and there's a family there.

842
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,750
And here we go to the book,
the mistress of the house.

843
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:33,040
Seeing that I was the head
man occasionally came down
and sat beside me as I

844
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:37,660
worked, bringing her daughter, a very
handsome, dark eyed Spanish girl.

845
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,480
And as a matter of course I fell in love.

846
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:46,630
We soon became better acquainted and
the mother one evening having sat and

847
00:54:46,631 --> 00:54:47,560
chatted to me,

848
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:51,730
serving me with wine and other good
things on my rising to leave the shop,

849
00:54:51,731 --> 00:54:53,290
made a signal for me to follow her.

850
00:54:54,430 --> 00:54:57,400
She had managed to pick up a little
English and I knew a few words.

851
00:54:57,401 --> 00:55:01,000
It's Spanish language so that we could
pretty well comprehend each other's

852
00:55:01,001 --> 00:55:04,000
meeting. And after leading
me into their sitting room,

853
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:09,150
she brought in her handsome daughter and
without more circumstance offered her

854
00:55:09,491 --> 00:55:11,050
to me for a wife.

855
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,230
Okay.

856
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:13,550
The offer was attempting one,

857
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:17,420
but the conditions of the marriage
made it impossible for me to comply.

858
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:20,690
Since I was to change my
religion and dessert, my colors,

859
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,500
the old Dame proposed to conceal me
effectually when the army marched after

860
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:31,370
which I was to live like a gentlemen
with the handsome Maria for a wife.

861
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,080
Okay.

862
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,610
It was hard to refuse.

863
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:39,020
So tempting an offer with pretty
Maria endeavoring to back her mother's

864
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:39,854
proposal.

865
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:40,970
Okay.

866
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:41,661
Hi.
However,

867
00:55:41,661 --> 00:55:46,661
made them understand that nothing would
tempt me to dessert and promising to try

868
00:55:46,671 --> 00:55:49,880
and get my discharge. When I
returned to England, I protested.

869
00:55:49,881 --> 00:55:52,490
I would then return and Mary Maria.

870
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,650
Okay.

871
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,900
Soon after this,
the army marched for Spain.

872
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,340
Okay.

873
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:03,340
The rifles paraded in the very street
where the shop I had so long worked at was

874
00:56:03,441 --> 00:56:06,410
situated.
And I saw Maria at the window

875
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:12,310
as our Buechel struck up,
she waved her handkerchief.

876
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:14,680
I returned the salute.

877
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:16,110
Yeah.

878
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,690
And, and a half an hour
had forgotten all about her

879
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,750
so much for the soldiers. Love that.

880
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:29,050
I read that and I said, I have to
read this. This is to every 18,

881
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:34,110
1920 and 21 year old service member out
there that you meet the girl your dreams

882
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,970
and you've, you've do you think
you're gonna do some dumb stuff?

883
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,580
Don't do the dumb stuff.

884
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:46,050
Go back to your platoon and in a half
an hour you'll forget about her because

885
00:56:47,081 --> 00:56:48,040
that's what happens.
Yeah.

886
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:55,450
Such so much for a soldiers.
Love [inaudible] back to the book.

887
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,050
Every man in the rifle seemed only
anxious to get a wrap at the French again.

888
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,230
Yeah,

889
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,550
on and on.
We toiled.

890
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,630
I love to remember the appearance of
that army as we moved along at this time.

891
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:09,900
It was a glorious sight to see
our color spread in these fields.

892
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:13,650
The men seemed invincible.
Nothing I fought could have beaten them.

893
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:18,743
Yeah.

894
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:22,570
Now he's talking about a guy named Cardo.

895
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:27,310
He was found to be most gallon officer
when we were engaged with the enemy in

896
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,144
the field.

897
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:32,500
He was killed whilst fighting bravely
in the peer knees and amongst other

898
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,950
jewelry he wore.
He had a ring on his finger wharf,

899
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:39,010
150 guineas as he laid dead on the field,

900
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:44,011
one of our rifle rifleman named or
observe the sparkling gem and immediately

901
00:57:44,531 --> 00:57:47,800
resolved to make a prize
of it. The ring, however,

902
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:51,790
was so firmly fixed that or could not
draw it from the finger and whipping out

903
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:52,870
his knife,

904
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,870
cut the finger off at the joint after
the battle or offered the ring for sale

905
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:00,820
amongst the officers and on inquiry.

906
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
The manner in which he had obtained
it transpired or Wisconsin or wasn't

907
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:12,091
consequence tried by court marshal
and sent us to receive 500 lashes.

908
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:13,880
Okay.

909
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,710
Which sentence is carried into execution?

910
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,640
There's some significant corporal
punishment going on here with the,

911
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:20,720
with the lashes

912
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:27,110
and that's one of the cases mean what do
you know when you're executing someone

913
00:58:27,111 --> 00:58:29,390
for being drunk and disorderly,

914
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:32,870
you're going to get some pretty severe
punishment for cutting the finger off of

915
00:58:32,871 --> 00:58:35,030
one of your officers so
you can steal their ring.

916
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:36,173
Yeah.

917
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,490
Back to the book,
it was during the heat of the day.

918
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:45,390
We were rather hotly pressed by the enemy
after having advanced somewhat to near

919
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:48,600
their force,
give and take is all fair enough.

920
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:51,930
But we were getting more kicks
than half pence as the saying is.

921
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:56,250
And their balls stung a so sharply that
the officers gave the word to fire and

922
00:58:56,251 --> 00:58:57,084
retire.

923
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,700
Doubtless many got a leaden
messenger as they did so,

924
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,310
which saved them the unpleasant necessity
of retracing their ground altogether.

925
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:13,710
Jock Gillespie and myself wheeled about
and obeyed the order just as we had

926
00:59:14,691 --> 00:59:14,931
done.

927
00:59:14,931 --> 00:59:19,931
So I saw Gillespie limp along as though
someone had bestowed a violent kick upon

928
00:59:20,481 --> 00:59:23,900
his person. However, he
didn't give up at first,

929
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:29,080
but continued to load and fire and make
off with other skirmishers skirmishers

930
00:59:29,630 --> 00:59:32,960
till we halted and made another stand for.

931
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:37,961
We never went further from them when
once engaged than we could possibly help.

932
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:39,950
I'm going to read that again.

933
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,570
Okay.

934
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:47,570
We continued to load and fire and make
off with other skirmishes till we halted

935
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,350
and made another stand for.

936
00:59:49,351 --> 00:59:54,351
We never went further from them when
once engaged than we could possibly help.

937
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:59,570
And what that means is cover move. Hmm.

938
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,730
So if you are out on the battlefield
and you get too far away from the other

939
01:00:04,891 --> 01:00:08,460
element where you can no longer support
them, you've made a big mistake.

940
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,340
So that's why they have doctrinal terms.

941
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:19,590
That mean I am in supporting distance.
I won't go further away from you then.

942
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,150
Then we're going where I can't help you.
Yeah.

943
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:27,370
Okay.

944
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:31,870
All right. Now speaking of lashings,
there's another situation here.

945
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,440
There was sort of a a ceremony where
they were gathering and standing in the

946
01:00:38,651 --> 01:00:39,920
parade sort of in a,

947
01:00:39,921 --> 01:00:44,770
in a town square and
somebody basically through,

948
01:00:44,771 --> 01:00:47,550
I think like a brick at,

949
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:50,950
it's one of the soldiers from one of
the windows that was watching the other

950
01:00:50,951 --> 01:00:51,441
regiment.

951
01:00:51,441 --> 01:00:54,070
So there's one regimen standing on
the parade field handing out awards or

952
01:00:54,071 --> 01:00:54,760
something.

953
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,760
The other regimens sitting up in the
various rooms around looking down and at

954
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:04,891
some point this this someone hawks
a brick down and it hits the kernel.

955
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:13,000
So
this Guy Liston was the guy that they,

956
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:17,200
they grab and they think it's this guy
list back to the book and was sentenced

957
01:01:17,201 --> 01:01:19,030
to receive 800 lashes.

958
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:22,750
The whole brigade turned
out on the occasion and I
remembered that the drummers

959
01:01:22,751 --> 01:01:27,751
of the Ninth Regiment where the infliction
of the lash list and list and receive

960
01:01:29,891 --> 01:01:32,110
the whole sentence without a murmur.

961
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:40,730
This is the him talking about as he
goes on to talk about how this strict

962
01:01:41,371 --> 01:01:46,371
discipline about it and how it kind of
fits in with the English mentality back

963
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:48,391
to the book.

964
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:53,391
They are strange set the English and so
determined an unconquerable that they

965
01:01:53,461 --> 01:01:58,020
will have their way if they can think
about that. You got your soldiers there,

966
01:01:58,021 --> 01:02:01,020
so it's a great quality
to have, right? You're,

967
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:03,840
you're determined and unconquerable
but what does that mean?

968
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,840
It means you're going to have your
way if you can and if you let them,

969
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,580
they're going to get after. It may be that
the way you don't expect. Yeah, indeed.

970
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:12,271
Back to the book,

971
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:17,271
it indeed it requires one
who has authority in his
face as well as add as back

972
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,220
to make respect and obey him.

973
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,800
They see too often in the instance of
sergeant majors that command does not suit

974
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:31,100
ignorant and course minded men and that
tyranny is too much used even in the

975
01:02:32,071 --> 01:02:35,880
brief authority which they have.
So again,

976
01:02:35,881 --> 01:02:38,010
he's going back to the fact that even
though you have to have these talking

977
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:40,800
about the dichotomy of leadership,
even though you have to have discipline,

978
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:44,370
you can't have tyranny
back to the book.

979
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,400
A soldier I am convinced is driven often
to insubordination by being worried by

980
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:52,340
these little minded men for the various,

981
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:57,410
the various trifles about which the
gentlemen never thinks of tormenting him.

982
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,540
So the this, the, the,

983
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:06,160
the little minded person that harps on
these little trifling things and that's

984
01:03:06,161 --> 01:03:11,110
what actually creates insubordination
whereas the gentleman never thinks of

985
01:03:11,111 --> 01:03:15,280
tormenting him with these little things
like these little things don't matter.

986
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:20,470
The, and then he goes on to balance
this dichotomy of leadership.

987
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,910
Back to the book of the moment.

988
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:25,570
The severity of the discipline of
our army has relaxed, in my opinion,

989
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,190
farewell to its efficiency.

990
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
But for men to be tormented about
trifles as I've seen it many times,

991
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,060
is often very injurous to the whole core.

992
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:41,620
So this is the perfect talking about the
balance of the dichotomy of leadership.

993
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,180
If you're to ultra strict, you're
guys are going to rebel against you.

994
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,970
And if you're not strict enough,
if you don't impose enough discipline,

995
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,450
they're going to not have any control.
So you got to balance these two

996
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:05,260
going forward. Back to the book. War is
a sad blunt or of the feelings of men.

997
01:04:05,261 --> 01:04:07,060
He said that before and
he's saying it again.

998
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:12,250
We felt we felt eager to be added again.
Nay.

999
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:17,080
I am afraid we longed for blood as the
chair of our comrades sounded in our ears

1000
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:21,970
and yet amidst all this softer feelings
occasionally filled the breasts of those

1001
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:25,720
gallant fellows even whilst they were
thirsting for the site of the enemy.

1002
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:28,080
Some of the men near me,

1003
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:33,350
suddenly Rico recollected as they saw
the snow line physically on our pass path

1004
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:35,040
that this was Christmas Eve.

1005
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:40,690
The recollection soon spread amongst the
men and many talked of home and scenes

1006
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:45,190
upon that night in the other days of old
England shedding tears as they spoke of

1007
01:04:45,191 --> 01:04:48,670
the roulette relatives and friends
never to be seen again by them.

1008
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:53,010
As night approached,
we became less talkative.

1009
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,760
The increasing weariness of our limbs
kept our tongues quieter and we were many

1010
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:03,951
of us half asleep as we
walked when suddenly a shout
arose in the front that the

1011
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:05,700
French were upon us.

1012
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:07,580
Yeah,

1013
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:11,180
so guys are missing home.
It's Christmas Eve.

1014
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:13,310
Nice little dusting of snow on the ground

1015
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,530
there. They have this skirmish with a
French there and now they're continuing

1016
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,800
continuing the first march.
And if you remember the march that the,

1017
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:27,850
that we talked about with Napoleon's
troops going into Russia and back,

1018
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:33,040
these guys are under the
same basic conditions of if
you want to move the army,

1019
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:37,810
the army's going to walk back to the
book of Sergeant of the night. So the,

1020
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:41,860
so he's now on this also. He not only,
they are forced marching right now,

1021
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,370
they're starting to retreat.
They're starting to do, they,

1022
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,070
they're starting to take heavies
and they start uh, uh, uh,

1023
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,360
retreat back to the book.

1024
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:54,100
A sergeant of the 92nd highlanders just
about this time fell dead with fatigue

1025
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,400
and no one stopped as we pass
to offer him any assistance.

1026
01:05:58,310 --> 01:05:58,800
Okay.

1027
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,830
Knight came down upon us. So
those, think about that and this,

1028
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:03,600
I highlighted that one,

1029
01:06:03,601 --> 01:06:06,780
but throughout this book he talks about
people just dying and he says they died

1030
01:06:06,781 --> 01:06:11,610
a fatigue. I don't even know what that
means actually. Maybe they're dehydrated.

1031
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,473
I don't know.

1032
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,990
But if you think about these guys who
are risking their lives for each other,

1033
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:19,590
how exhausted are they that when someone
falls out during this first march,

1034
01:06:19,591 --> 01:06:21,090
the forced march,
they just leave them there

1035
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:29,100
back to the book night came down upon
us without our having tasted food or

1036
01:06:29,101 --> 01:06:29,934
halted.

1037
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:35,010
I speak for myself and those around me
all and all night long we continued this

1038
01:06:35,011 --> 01:06:39,390
dreadful march. Men began to look into
each other's faces and ask the questions,

1039
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,000
ask the question, are we ever to be halted
again? And many of the week restore,

1040
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:45,600
we're now seeing to stagger,

1041
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:51,110
make a few desperate efforts and
then fall perhaps to rise no more.

1042
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:52,300
Okay.

1043
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:57,300
Most of us had devoured all we carried
in or have or sacks and each and and and

1044
01:06:57,401 --> 01:06:58,720
endeavored to catch up.

1045
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,770
Anything we could snatch from
a hut or cottage in our route.

1046
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,780
Many even at this period would have
straggled from the ranks and perished had

1047
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:11,800
not. Crawford held them
together with a, from rain,

1048
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:17,620
one such bold and stern commander in
the east during a memorable disaster and

1049
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:21,820
that devoted army had
reached its refuge on broken.

1050
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:27,030
Thus we staggered on night and day for
about four days before we discovered the

1051
01:07:27,791 --> 01:07:29,560
reason of this forced march.

1052
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:31,620
Okay.

1053
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:35,220
And they find out that they're
marching actually towards England.

1054
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:39,900
They're trying to get away. And this
a guy that I talked about, Crawford,

1055
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,900
he's pretty significant.

1056
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,690
And here's a little talk about Crawford.

1057
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,250
Crawford seem to sniff the sound of
battle from afar with Pq your feelings.

1058
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,260
He halted us for a few minutes.

1059
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:56,370
Occasionally when the distant clamor
became more distinct and his face turned

1060
01:07:56,371 --> 01:08:00,030
toward the sound and seem to
light up and become less stern,

1061
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:06,000
it was then indeed that every poor fellow
clutched his weapon more firmly and

1062
01:08:06,001 --> 01:08:10,740
wished for a site of the enemy
before long they had their wish.

1063
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:13,590
The enemy's calvary.
We're on our skirts that night.

1064
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:17,600
And as we rushed out of a small village,
we turned to bay.

1065
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,670
So even though they're retreating, they're
still having to fight. And this again,

1066
01:08:25,671 --> 01:08:30,320
this guy, Crawford, is
definitely a powerful leader.

1067
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:32,840
Back to the book,
I remember one evening during the retreat,

1068
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:35,990
he detected two men straying
away from the main body.

1069
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:40,520
It was in the early stage of that
disastrous flight. And Crawford knew.

1070
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:42,370
Yeah,

1071
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:46,570
and Crawford knew well that he must do
his utmost to keep the division together.

1072
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:49,870
He halted the brigade
with a voice of Thunder,

1073
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:54,700
ordered a drum head court martial on
the instant and they were sentenced to a

1074
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:58,210
hundred a piece.
Whilst a hasty trial was taking place,

1075
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:03,390
Crawford dismounting from his horse stood
in the midst looking stern and angry

1076
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:05,410
as a worried bulldog.

1077
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:06,780
Yeah,

1078
01:09:06,780 --> 01:09:09,030
he did not like retreating at all.
That man.

1079
01:09:12,990 --> 01:09:17,190
They march a little bit further and then
back to the book ordering a square to

1080
01:09:17,191 --> 01:09:21,600
be formed. He spoke to the brigade as
well as I can remember in these words,

1081
01:09:21,601 --> 01:09:26,400
after having ordered the three before
named man of the 95th to be brought into

1082
01:09:26,401 --> 01:09:27,234
the square.

1083
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:33,110
Although he said I should
obtain the goodwill,

1084
01:09:33,111 --> 01:09:37,520
neither of the officers nor the men
of the brigade here. By doing so,

1085
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:41,750
I am resolved to punish these three
men according to the sentence awarded,

1086
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,180
even though the French are at our heels,

1087
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:47,120
begin with Daniel Howard's.

1088
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:52,790
So these guys were looked like they were
going to dessert and they got caught

1089
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:57,020
and he got a court martial on the spot
and going to give them a hundred lashes

1090
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:02,000
or whatever the number was, and even
though they're running and retreating,

1091
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:06,680
he's all right. We're going, we're
going to administer this punishment now,

1092
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:11,090
even though it's not popular.
I got to do it back to the book.

1093
01:10:11,091 --> 01:10:14,420
This was indeed no time to be lax and
disciplined in the general knew it.

1094
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,760
The men, as I said, where some of them

1095
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:22,940
becoming careless and roughing and Lee
and their demeanor whilst others, again,

1096
01:10:22,941 --> 01:10:23,774
I saw with my,

1097
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:28,010
with the tears falling down their cheeks
from the agony of their bleeding feet

1098
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:32,510
and many were ill with dysentery and
from the effects of bad food they had got

1099
01:10:32,511 --> 01:10:35,990
ahold of and devoured on the road.
Our knapsacks too.

1100
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:40,130
We're a bitter enemy in this
prolonged march. Many a man died.

1101
01:10:40,131 --> 01:10:43,730
I'm convinced who would have borne
up well to the end of the retreat,

1102
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:47,030
but for the infernal load
we carried on our backs.

1103
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:50,450
My own knapsack was my bitterest enemy.

1104
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:56,080
I felt it pressed me to the earth almost
at times and more than once felt as if

1105
01:10:56,091 --> 01:11:01,040
I should die under its deadly
embrace. The knapsacks, in my opinion,

1106
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:05,570
she have been abandoned at the very
commencement of the Retro Gate Movement as

1107
01:11:05,571 --> 01:11:07,760
it would've been better to
have lost them all together.

1108
01:11:07,940 --> 01:11:12,940
If by such loss we could have saved the
poor fellows who as it was dyed strapped

1109
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,120
to them on the road.

1110
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:22,330
There was some difficulty in finding a
place to tie how ends up as the light

1111
01:11:22,331 --> 01:11:24,940
brigade carried no Halbert's.

1112
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,680
However they led them to a slender
ash tree, which grew near at hand.

1113
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:34,120
Don't trouble yourselves about tying
me up. Set Howland's folding his arms.

1114
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,520
I'll take my punishment like a man.

1115
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:38,210
Yeah,

1116
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,720
he did. So without a murmur
receiving the whole 300.

1117
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,260
His wife who is present with us,

1118
01:11:45,261 --> 01:11:49,190
I remember was a strong hardy Irish woman.

1119
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:55,590
So don't worry about tying be up. You
hit me 300 times. We add, uh, you know,

1120
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:59,890
they do the whipping thing with the,
when you get your belt, do you remember?

1121
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:03,440
Do you remember Irish? John, can you tall?

1122
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,800
Pretty lanky and real good at Jujitsu
and he got his blue belt and he walked

1123
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:14,870
through the whipping
hallway to get his belt,

1124
01:12:14,871 --> 01:12:17,510
but got the gauntlet.
He Wa he walked through the gauntlet.

1125
01:12:18,050 --> 01:12:23,050
He just walked and stopped at each person
and gave them the opportunity to give

1126
01:12:23,181 --> 01:12:25,670
them all they got. Yeah,
that was pretty legit.

1127
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:31,820
He sounds like he sounds like he sounds
like my boy. Howland's right here.

1128
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,770
More about Crawford right
here. This is classic. They're,

1129
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:41,360
they're getting to a river.

1130
01:12:41,361 --> 01:12:44,360
They got across the river on their
retreat back to the book. Presently,

1131
01:12:44,361 --> 01:12:48,620
he spied an officer who to save himself
from being wet through I suppose and

1132
01:12:48,621 --> 01:12:52,610
wearing a damn pair of breaches for the
remainder of the day had mounted on the

1133
01:12:52,611 --> 01:12:54,050
back of one of his men,

1134
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:59,290
the site of such a piece of a feminist.

1135
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:04,291
He was enough to raise the color of the
general and in a very short time he was

1136
01:13:04,351 --> 01:13:08,730
plunging and splashing through the
water. After them both put him down, sir,

1137
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:09,750
put him down.

1138
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:13,800
I desire you to put that officer down
instantly and the soldier in an instant,

1139
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:18,210
I dare say loft dropping his burden
like a hot potato into the stream,

1140
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:21,720
continued his progress
through, returned back, sir,

1141
01:13:21,810 --> 01:13:25,410
said Crawford to the officer and go
through the water like the others.

1142
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:29,940
I will not allow my officers to ride
upon the men's back through the rivers.

1143
01:13:30,180 --> 01:13:32,580
All must take their share of like here.

1144
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,210
You can just go ahead and
note that down is how to lead.

1145
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:38,610
That's just the,

1146
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:43,620
that's a metaphorical and literal example.
Hey,

1147
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:48,621
I'm going to ride on the back of my
enlisted man so that I can stay dry.

1148
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,490
What a savage.

1149
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:54,000
I think that that guy should have
guns will ashes back to the book.

1150
01:13:54,001 --> 01:13:59,001
General Crawford was indeed one of the
few men who is apparently created for the

1151
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:02,820
command during such dreadful scenes as
we were familiar with in this retreat.

1152
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,210
He seemed an iron man.
Nothing daunted him,

1153
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:08,400
nothing turned him from his purpose.

1154
01:14:08,670 --> 01:14:13,670
War was his very element and toil and
danger seemed to call forth and increasing

1155
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:17,860
determination to surmount them.

1156
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:21,703
Okay.

1157
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:22,663
Would you yet?

1158
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:29,610
Now they are continuing
to March and again it's,

1159
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,300
it's a story we've heard many times on
here and how harsh foot marches can be

1160
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:40,110
and at this point, rifleman Harris, he's,

1161
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:44,850
he doesn't think he's going to
make it. Hmm. And he's fading fast.

1162
01:14:44,851 --> 01:14:46,500
He's marching with a guy named Brooks.

1163
01:14:46,501 --> 01:14:50,790
They're kind of broken up into pairs to
try and stay together a little bit and

1164
01:14:50,791 --> 01:14:53,580
he's trying to maintain back to the book.

1165
01:14:53,581 --> 01:14:56,820
I remember Sir Dudley Hill
passing me on a mule this day.

1166
01:14:57,090 --> 01:14:59,850
He wore a Spanish straw
hat and had his cloak on.

1167
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,870
He looked back when he had passed
and addressed me. Harris said, he,

1168
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,960
I see you cannot keep up. He peered
very sorry for me for he knew me well,

1169
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:11,940
you must do your best.
He said,

1170
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:16,800
my man and keep up with us or you
will fall into the hands of the enemy.

1171
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:19,500
As the day wore on,

1172
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:24,740
I grew weaker and weaker and at last spite
all of my efforts I saw the main body

1173
01:15:25,681 --> 01:15:28,140
leave me hopelessly in the lurch.

1174
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,080
Brooks himself was getting weaker too.

1175
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:36,260
He saw it was of little use to urge me
on and at length assenting to my repeated

1176
01:15:36,721 --> 01:15:38,520
requests to be left behind.

1177
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:44,240
He hurried on as well and he was
able without a word of farewell.

1178
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:47,020
Okay.

1179
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:52,000
I now soon sink down in the road and lay
beside another man who had also fallen,

1180
01:15:52,001 --> 01:15:56,050
was apparently dead and whom might
recognized as one of our sergeants named

1181
01:15:56,140 --> 01:15:56,973
Taylor.

1182
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,103
Yeah.

1183
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:10,690
Whilst we lay exhausted in the road,
the rear guard,

1184
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,980
which was now endeavoring to drive on
the stragglers approached and a sergeant

1185
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:17,500
of the rifles came up and
stopped and look at us.

1186
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:21,190
He dressed himself to me
and ordered me to rise,

1187
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:25,000
but I told them it was a useless for
him to trouble himself about me as I was

1188
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:27,310
unable to move a step further.

1189
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:28,840
Okay.

1190
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:31,420
Whilst he was urging me
to endeavor to rise up,

1191
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,420
the officer in command of the
rear guard also stepped up.

1192
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,630
The name of this officer
was Lieutenant Cox.

1193
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,560
He was a brave and good man and observing
at the sergeant was rough in his

1194
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:43,030
language and manner towards me.

1195
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:47,140
He silenced him and bade the
guard proceed and leave me.

1196
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:48,890
Okay.

1197
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:52,790
Let Him die quietly. Hicks, he said
to the sergeant, I know him well.

1198
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,100
He's not Amanda lie here.
If he could get on.

1199
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,560
Okay.

1200
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,270
I'm sorry.
Harris Harris.

1201
01:16:58,510 --> 01:17:03,510
He said to see you reduced to this for
I fear there is no help to be had now.

1202
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:05,970
Yeah.

1203
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:10,310
He then moved on after
his men and me to my feet.

1204
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,633
Yeah.

1205
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:17,230
Lot different than never
leave a man behind.

1206
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:20,770
You've actually got people just saying,
hey, you're not going to make it do.

1207
01:17:20,771 --> 01:17:21,940
I can see you're not going to make it.

1208
01:17:21,941 --> 01:17:24,430
I know you're a tough guy and if you're
not, if we're not walking right now,

1209
01:17:24,431 --> 01:17:25,820
there isn't.
We've got nothing for you

1210
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:32,410
on now.
He lays there for awhile and he actually,

1211
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,800
once he rests for awhile,
he regains a little bit of strength,

1212
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:38,290
eventually crawls to a house,

1213
01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:43,900
gets in the house and gets a little
bit of food, gets a little bit of a,

1214
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:46,020
I would love to say water
but isn't get water.

1215
01:17:46,021 --> 01:17:51,021
He gets food and wine
and he recovers somewhat.

1216
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:55,780
He pretty much recovers. Um,
sleeps for awhile. Wakes up,

1217
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:58,660
recovers and now he can
now he can walk again.

1218
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:03,190
And what do you think would happen now?

1219
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:07,170
Like in a case as similar to
this as possible? You know,

1220
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,470
but just now we're at, I can't make
it. What do you do? Carry him? Yeah.

1221
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:14,070
I mean you'd try and carry him. Of
course. Other guys. Got It. Yeah.

1222
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:19,120
And I mean it's horrible to think of
these situations where if we have to move

1223
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:26,800
these all these men and to sit there,
if we start, let's, let's weigh this.

1224
01:18:26,801 --> 01:18:29,950
You'd have to weigh this.
If we try and carry all over wounded out,

1225
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:33,340
none of us are going to live.
Right. So that, that's what the,

1226
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:37,750
that's the situation that
they're likely facing. Hey,

1227
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:42,070
you're either gonna get Outta
here yourself and people
don't understand how hard

1228
01:18:42,071 --> 01:18:46,000
it is to carry it down,
man. It's, it's a very, very
difficult to carry it down, man.

1229
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,970
Especially across terrain.
Then you know,

1230
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:52,240
sometime in wrestling practice you pick
up and you pick up your partner and you

1231
01:18:52,241 --> 01:18:55,780
do a couple laps. Right. And Yeah, you
know, it's all good. You're honest,

1232
01:18:55,781 --> 01:18:59,920
nice smooth surface. The guys cooperating,
cooperating is not just dead weight.

1233
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:04,150
It's, yeah, when you start carrying bodies
around, it's really, really difficult.

1234
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:07,030
Yeah. So you don't, it's
not a one-to-one either.

1235
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:11,620
So if one guy's down you can't,
it's not just one person carries that guy.

1236
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,790
It actually has to be two or sometimes
three when you have gear on. Yeah.

1237
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:20,290
And we have methods of carrying guys. I
mean, well I can carry you a little while,

1238
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:23,830
right? Yeah. But after a
little while, you know,

1239
01:19:23,831 --> 01:19:27,610
be that 500 meters,
a thousand meters,

1240
01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:31,150
you're not going to be your, and also
your combat ineffective. You can't,

1241
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:35,230
you can't utilize your weapon properly.
Not for, not for any length of time.

1242
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:37,540
So you know,

1243
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:41,050
in a situation like this that the decision
that these leaders are making is, hey,

1244
01:19:41,051 --> 01:19:44,950
guess what, if we don't just keep
walking, we're going to get overrun,

1245
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:48,190
the French are going to catch us and
we're all going to die. So Harris,

1246
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,210
he got nothing for you.

1247
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:54,040
So in countries like now we'll say if
there was a circumstance like that where

1248
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:55,900
we're going to lose more guys,

1249
01:19:55,930 --> 01:20:00,930
if we bring this guy with us or one big
luxury that we have now is we have f air

1250
01:20:04,391 --> 01:20:08,040
support. Yeah. So, oh, the enemy
wants to keep coming at us.

1251
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,410
Cool. We'll sit here and call,
drop bombs on them all day.

1252
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:14,100
Situations like that have happened
over and over again in the modern wars.

1253
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:14,851
And when in the eight,

1254
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:18,390
Iraq and Afghanistan were small
elements are out there in the field.

1255
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:22,840
They're about to get overrun and
the aircraft and air, air, fire, uh,

1256
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:26,820
air power comes in and completely saves
the day and keeps the enemy at bay for

1257
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:30,750
extended periods of time.
So we have, uh, an option,

1258
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,180
another option,
but in the,

1259
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:38,010
I guess ultimately it'd be a hypothetical
then the case hypothetically, we then,

1260
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:40,350
then you got to put someone in that
situation and see what they're gonna do.

1261
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,040
And that's a decision you've got to make
as well as a leader and an on the spot.

1262
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:45,500
I mean,
you,

1263
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:50,500
you'd be weighing all these micro
micro facets that are happening.

1264
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:54,900
How far away are the bad guys?
How many of them are there?

1265
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,320
Do I have reinforcements coming? Is
there any terrain I can take is or what,

1266
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:02,110
you know, what can I do? How
many people are down? Yeah.

1267
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:05,040
You have to weigh all these things out
and make a decision and it's going to be

1268
01:21:05,041 --> 01:21:06,690
a hard decision for sure.

1269
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:12,150
So you don't put like the, the,
the concept or should I say,

1270
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:12,900
um,

1271
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,900
like the action of at least trying to
bring the guy with you ahead of like other

1272
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:21,300
guys lives.

1273
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:26,300
So you need a circumstance like
this where you hypothetically,

1274
01:21:26,590 --> 01:21:29,160
you don't have any content,
you don't have any support,

1275
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:30,420
you don't have any other options.

1276
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:33,630
It's either other guys die or the
where we leave this guy behind.

1277
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,520
The fact that you tried to bring the guy
doesn't Trump like the lives of other

1278
01:21:41,371 --> 01:21:42,204
guys

1279
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:48,700
where if the decision is to be made where
it's understood like other guys would

1280
01:21:48,701 --> 01:21:52,380
have died if we didn't leave this
guy here, that would be okay.

1281
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:56,220
It's not going to be okay and you're
going to have to live with one horrible,

1282
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:01,050
right thought or the other. Right, right.
The the thing that's powerful about,

1283
01:22:01,051 --> 01:22:02,970
we're not going to leave
everything anyone behind.

1284
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,090
The thing that's powerful
about that is if that's your,

1285
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:10,170
if that's your default mode, your default
mode is to fight. And that's what,

1286
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:14,190
that's, that's what we train. That's when
I say we, I mean like America trains,

1287
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:17,970
we're not going to leave you behind.
And so when that's your goto attitude,

1288
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,510
that's your go to attitude and
all the thoughts about, hey,

1289
01:22:21,511 --> 01:22:24,750
we'll weigh it out and all of a sudden
there's like, no, we're going to fight.

1290
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:26,040
We're going to kill
everyone and we're going to,

1291
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,490
we're going to do everything we can to,
to bring everyone back. That's what we do.

1292
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:33,690
And that is a powerful thing. Yeah, man,

1293
01:22:33,691 --> 01:22:37,890
these are savage times. These
are savage times. Savage Time's

1294
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,510
going. So like I said,
he does recover though.

1295
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:46,380
Luckily before the French get to him,
he recovers enough to get out,

1296
01:22:46,381 --> 01:22:47,610
start walking again,

1297
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,810
and he talks a little
bit how he was clinging.

1298
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:56,130
I mean he was clinging to
survival back to the book.

1299
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,820
It is however, indeed astonishing
how a man clings to life.

1300
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:03,420
I am certain that had I
laid down at this period,

1301
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:07,240
I should have found my last
bill on the spot I sank upon.

1302
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,780
Suddenly I heard a shout in the front,
which was prolonged in a sort of hub hub.

1303
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:18,220
Even the stragglers whom I saw dotting
the road in front of me seemed to have

1304
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:20,140
caught something like hope.

1305
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:24,070
And as the poor fellows now reached
the top of the hill we're sending,

1306
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:26,620
I heard an occasional exclamation of joy.

1307
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:29,710
The first note of the sort
I'd heard from any days.

1308
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:30,990
Yeah.

1309
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:34,500
When I reached the top of the hill,
the thing spoke for itself.

1310
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:38,740
They're far away in our front.
The English shipping lay in.

1311
01:23:40,070 --> 01:23:40,500
Okay.

1312
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:45,500
It's a view had indeed
acted like a restorative,

1313
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:46,530
uh,

1314
01:23:46,530 --> 01:23:51,530
to our force and the men at the prospect
of the termination of such a march had

1315
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:55,080
plucked up spirit for a last effort.

1316
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:56,440
Okay.

1317
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,440
Fellows who like myself seemed hardly
have strengthened their legs to creep up

1318
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:06,280
the ascent seem now to have picked
up a fresh pair to get down with

1319
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:07,680
okay.

1320
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:10,140
Such as hope to us pour mortals.

1321
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:15,350
So they obviously
see the uh,

1322
01:24:15,390 --> 01:24:20,390
see the ships and that inspires them and
they start moving a little bit faster.

1323
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:21,361
Back to the book,

1324
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:26,361
there was I recollect a man of the name
of Belle of the rifles who had been

1325
01:24:27,241 --> 01:24:30,210
during this day holding a
sort of creeping race with me.

1326
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:33,330
We had passed and repassed each
other as our strength served.

1327
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,170
Bell was a rather discontented
fellow at the best of times,

1328
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:41,430
but during this retreat he had
given full scope. Two is ill temper,

1329
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:46,320
cursing the hour he was born and wishing
his mother had strangled him when he

1330
01:24:46,321 --> 01:24:50,100
came into the world in order to have
saved him from his present toil.

1331
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:51,760
Okay.

1332
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,080
He had not now spoken for some time and
the site of the English shipping had

1333
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:59,560
apparently a very
beneficial effect upon him.

1334
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:01,150
Okay.

1335
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:04,840
He burst into tears as he stood
and looked at it. Harris. He said,

1336
01:25:04,990 --> 01:25:07,660
if it pleases God to let
me reach those ships,

1337
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,920
I swear never to utter a bad
or discontented word again,

1338
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,103
appreciation.

1339
01:25:17,530 --> 01:25:22,530
And he did make it to the
ships and Harris Rifleman.

1340
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:24,460
Harris made it to the ships and

1341
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:25,930
okay,

1342
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:30,930
they got embarked on those ships
and they sailed back to England.

1343
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,720
Okay.

1344
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:37,720
For a few days and then get off the
English shore and then finally back to the

1345
01:25:37,881 --> 01:25:38,211
book.

1346
01:25:38,211 --> 01:25:43,211
One fine morning received orders to
disembark and our poor bare feet once more

1347
01:25:43,910 --> 01:25:45,410
touched English ground.

1348
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:46,910
Yeah.

1349
01:25:46,910 --> 01:25:50,690
The inhabitants flock down to
the beach to see us as we did so.

1350
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:55,460
And they must have been a good deal.
Surprised at the spectacle we presented.

1351
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:56,850
Okay.

1352
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:58,680
Our beards were long and ragged,

1353
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:02,130
almost all were without
shoes and stockings.

1354
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,990
Many had their clothes and accoutrements
in fragments with their heads.

1355
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:10,991
Swathed in old rags and our weapons were
covered with rust whilst not a few had

1356
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:15,380
now from toil and fatigue
become quite blind.

1357
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,110
Okay,

1358
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:19,930
let not the reader,
however think that now we,

1359
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:24,100
we were to be despised as soldiers,
long marches,

1360
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:28,060
inclement weather and want to
food had done their work upon us,

1361
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:33,240
but we were perhaps better than we are
appeared as the sequel showed under the

1362
01:26:33,701 --> 01:26:34,840
gallon.
Crawford,

1363
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:40,290
we had made some tremendous marches and
even Gal Dar enemies so severely making

1364
01:26:41,411 --> 01:26:42,940
good our retreat.

1365
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:44,480
Yeah.

1366
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:49,280
But our comrades and adversity who had
retired by the other road under general

1367
01:26:49,281 --> 01:26:54,281
more turn to bay there and show the enemy
that the English soldier is not to be

1368
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,220
beaten even under the most
adverse circumstances,

1369
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:04,050
the field of death and slaughter,
the march,

1370
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:09,180
the BIVOUAC and the retreat are no
bad places in which to judge men.

1371
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,350
I have had some opportunities of
judging them in all these situations.

1372
01:27:16,351 --> 01:27:20,130
And I should say that the British are
amongst the most splendid soldiers in the

1373
01:27:20,131 --> 01:27:24,960
world. Give them fair play
and they are unconquerable.

1374
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,480
Yeah.

1375
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,530
For my own part,

1376
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:33,260
I can only say that I enjoyed life more
whilst on active service than I have

1377
01:27:33,261 --> 01:27:34,730
ever done since.

1378
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,250
Yeah.

1379
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:40,210
And as I sit at work in my
shop in Richmond Street,

1380
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:45,300
so Ho I look back upon that portion
of my time spent in the fields of the

1381
01:27:46,031 --> 01:27:50,410
peninsula as the only
part worthy of remembrance

1382
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,960
it is at such times that scene's long
past come back upon my mind as if they had

1383
01:27:58,601 --> 01:28:00,220
taken place.
But yesterday

1384
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,840
I remember even the appearance of
some regiments engaged and comrades,

1385
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,680
long molder to dust.

1386
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:18,160
I see again performing the acts of heroes,

1387
01:28:30,450 --> 01:28:34,950
acts,
heroes,

1388
01:28:36,430 --> 01:28:37,510
and I think it's

1389
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:39,650
okay.

1390
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:44,650
Safe to call riflemen Benjamin
Randall Harris I hero as well.

1391
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:51,193
Yeah.

1392
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:55,990
And at the same time,

1393
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:57,323
yeah,

1394
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,480
I think it's important
to remember that these,

1395
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:05,040
Yep. These men, these heroes,

1396
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:10,041
they're not superheroes
like we see today in movies.

1397
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:14,550
They don't wear a cape.
They don't have any super human strength.

1398
01:29:14,551 --> 01:29:17,280
They have no special powers.

1399
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:20,520
What they do have is they have will.

1400
01:29:23,310 --> 01:29:24,143
Yeah.

1401
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,800
The will to fight the will to drive
on the will to live the will to win.

1402
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:40,440
And I think
that's the superpower.

1403
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:47,450
They knew. It never ceases to amaze
me. These aren't normal people.

1404
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:51,680
Riflemen Harris was normal guy.

1405
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:55,723
My costs,

1406
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,510
but when called upon to March,

1407
01:30:03,020 --> 01:30:06,050
they march and when called upon to fight,

1408
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,610
they fight and when called
upon to rise up and overcome,

1409
01:30:10,611 --> 01:30:14,780
they do just that they
rise up and overcome.

1410
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,353
Yeah.

1411
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:23,290
And that shows us

1412
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:28,780
that we can do the same
thing in the Fallon,

1413
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:31,180
in the challenges that we face.

1414
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:35,650
We can do the same thing.

1415
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,513
Yeah.

1416
01:30:38,730 --> 01:30:42,120
Briars
and overcome.

1417
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:51,890
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

1418
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:53,660
So Echo

1419
01:30:55,160 --> 01:31:00,160
perhaps if you could let people
know how they can support themselves

1420
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:06,890
and maybe if they want to support
this podcast as well. It's crazy.

1421
01:31:06,891 --> 01:31:07,310
Huh?

1422
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:12,160
These marches, right? Brutal.
Yeah. And this is, uh, I dunno,

1423
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:15,770
maybe no. From what I can remember,
the, the worst one that when you,

1424
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:18,290
especially how they talk about
it with no shoes to shoes,

1425
01:31:18,810 --> 01:31:21,800
their shoes probably just fall off
within the first, you know, a little bit.

1426
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:25,490
And then they're walking with no
shoes or barely any shoes or whatever.

1427
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:29,300
Crying straight up just from the
march, by the way. Yeah. Not the,

1428
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:33,620
not the war or anything like
that where the marches yet

1429
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,470
just as big of an enemy.
He said his pack was his biggest enemy.

1430
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:44,900
He had literally though the kind of
work guys are strapped, killing them,

1431
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:45,983
killing them,
killing them.

1432
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:49,000
So we,

1433
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:53,740
we just got back from Utah
obviously and um, you know,

1434
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:58,210
after every we're doing that training
where we brief debrief reco down,

1435
01:31:58,211 --> 01:32:01,930
exercise B and then, you
know, we've walked back and
forth. Right. Okay. So, okay,

1436
01:32:01,931 --> 01:32:02,770
so echo,

1437
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,960
I'll just tell people these people
have no idea what you're talking about,

1438
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:08,140
which is fine. Echo, we just
got echelon front, did a

1439
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:13,030
FTX field training exercise with
the company we were in Utah.

1440
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:17,020
We brought echo out so that he
could get some footage and whatnot.

1441
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:20,530
And so then, so that's what we're
talking about. So we're in the field,

1442
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:26,230
we're doing basically urban
combat with a group of,

1443
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,630
let's call them regular people,

1444
01:32:28,631 --> 01:32:33,631
business people that are
learning leadership through
experiential environments.

1445
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:39,110
It's an interesting one is a good one.
It's like the,

1446
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:41,800
it's like a con,

1447
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:46,940
you know how if you don't communicate
with someone effectively, right,

1448
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:47,853
things fall apart.

1449
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:52,390
I know exactly what you're going to
say is drawn out situation in life.

1450
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:57,010
But this is like a condense
version of that. Yes.

1451
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:00,910
So if you don't communicate with
someone during an Ftx, it do, you know,

1452
01:33:00,911 --> 01:33:04,510
within like 30 seconds that
something just went wrong.

1453
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:08,620
And now we're getting shot in the
face with a, with air soft rifles.

1454
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:10,013
It's just fun.

1455
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:14,470
It's really fun to watch from
the outside cause do you see it?

1456
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:17,740
And I've been to another one too.
Um, and yeah, you see it. It's right.

1457
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:20,770
And it's interesting how in the beginning
it's like, it's almost impossible.

1458
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:21,663
Like he don't,
right.

1459
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:26,940
And immediately communication breaks
down immediately and then towards the end

1460
01:33:27,161 --> 01:33:29,890
you start to see people
communicating, getting it. You know,

1461
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:33,130
like when you kind of got to
overcommunicate. Yeah, for sure.

1462
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:36,770
But the more you do that, the
more effective it is. You know,

1463
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:40,720
it's so crazy to watch. It is an, I don't
know if you remember Dave saying this,

1464
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:42,850
Dave told them,
he said,

1465
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:46,630
Jocko just told you the mistakes
that you're going to make.

1466
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:50,830
You told you what you're going
to do and you're going to do it.

1467
01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:53,200
And then sure enough,
every single one of them,

1468
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,470
the funniest was the one
individual that said,

1469
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:59,200
they came up with a plan
for something and we said,

1470
01:33:59,201 --> 01:34:02,950
you know your risk and get a blue, a
blue on blue there. Yeah. And she said,

1471
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:06,610
she said, listen, I
understand what you're saying,

1472
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:09,820
but it's not like we're going to walk
in there and start shooting each other.

1473
01:34:10,090 --> 01:34:12,430
That's not going to happen.
And, and sure enough,

1474
01:34:12,431 --> 01:34:17,431
that very girl was in a
stressful situation and they
entered a building from two

1475
01:34:17,561 --> 01:34:21,850
different sides at the same time. And
sure enough, she, she dusted one of her,

1476
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,460
one of her teammates and it was,
you know,

1477
01:34:25,461 --> 01:34:29,180
it's one of those things I
said, hey, remember what you
said yesterday? She said,

1478
01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:30,550
Oh yeah,
I remember.

1479
01:34:32,770 --> 01:34:37,000
And I had the luxury of seeing it from
the outside. You can feel it though.

1480
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:40,810
Oh yeah. But you're in a different
situation position than me.

1481
01:34:41,890 --> 01:34:45,990
Anyway, the point is, um, so
the terrain there was, um,

1482
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:49,240
where the field and where you,
where you actually do the,

1483
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:51,820
the field training part of it is like,

1484
01:34:51,821 --> 01:34:56,470
well what would you say 100 yards away
from the pre where you do the brief and

1485
01:34:56,471 --> 01:35:00,190
debrief has about 400 yards. Yeah. Yeah.
So it's, it's a little bit of three,

1486
01:35:00,470 --> 01:35:03,020
300 yards out.
If you're doing it again in the animal,

1487
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:08,210
we're going brief exercise,
debrief,

1488
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:12,650
brief exit, you know, kind
of all day. Really. So,

1489
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:17,240
and this was a situation where there,
it was a hill and rocky, you know,

1490
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:20,540
so I'm walking right and I have my
camera the whole time and it's not,

1491
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:24,240
it's lighter than my other accountant,
but you know, it's something. Um,

1492
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:27,620
and so I'm walking back and forth all day,
all day,

1493
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,740
where my feet are starting to get
kind of tired, more tired than normal.

1494
01:35:31,370 --> 01:35:35,330
And I'm thinking every but every single
time. Now, every single time I'm thinking,

1495
01:35:35,331 --> 01:35:39,920
this is nothing compared to what
you guys was going to do. Nothing.

1496
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,110
How nothing it was.
I didn't,

1497
01:35:42,180 --> 01:35:45,790
that didn't even go into my mind at all
in any way, shape or form. You don't,

1498
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,930
what's interesting about
that is while I'm walking,

1499
01:35:47,931 --> 01:35:50,090
this was like after lunchtime,
I'm thinking,

1500
01:35:50,091 --> 01:35:51,670
I'm seeing you guys and
everyone's Cruzee and,

1501
01:35:51,671 --> 01:35:55,470
and I'm thinking is everyone tried to act
like this isn't like Kinda kinda tired.

1502
01:35:55,510 --> 01:35:57,950
Literally didn't think of it until
you said this to me right now.

1503
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,250
The biggest I was, I was wholly
acting like, fuck, this is nothing.

1504
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:03,940
And I wasn't going to mention it.
I was going to brought,

1505
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:06,450
that's how I handle a lot of stuff.
That's good. And it helps him.

1506
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,870
But the fact is true.

1507
01:36:08,871 --> 01:36:13,070
You do actually better when you
pretend that it doesn't bother. Yes.

1508
01:36:14,020 --> 01:36:16,570
I remember that night and day
and night and night and day.

1509
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:20,480
So we started acting all tired and
accepting it and showing everyone. Yeah,

1510
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,830
it's true. But nonetheless,
the fact is it wasn't nothing.

1511
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,550
It wasn't nothing. I
felt it and you know, um,

1512
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:31,640
so it's funny, I'm looking at
you guys something like, Hey,

1513
01:36:31,641 --> 01:36:36,380
I wonder if these guys are, you know, um,
but no one said anything. Nobody said,

1514
01:36:36,381 --> 01:36:40,580
Dang, these tracks are
getting long, 300 meters bro.

1515
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:45,470
But nonetheless,

1516
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:50,471
so every time I feel anything like that
I think of like you guys first and you

1517
01:36:51,741 --> 01:36:55,670
guys are doing it in like crazy heat
to gear and like all this stuff.

1518
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:58,980
And I think that this kind of
guys, these gang guys, yeah.

1519
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:04,390
Riflemen Harris Riflemen Harris
feet all tore up starving,

1520
01:37:05,390 --> 01:37:09,410
starving, starving, no
sleep, no water, no water.

1521
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:13,520
And people are trying to kill you.
Oh yeah. So that's the point, man.

1522
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:16,070
If these guys can rise and overcome that,

1523
01:37:16,620 --> 01:37:21,140
what figure your personal potential.
Yeah. Right. Yeah, take of it.

1524
01:37:21,370 --> 01:37:24,740
I think of what more you could do.
Yeah. That bothers you a little bit.

1525
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:26,940
I just saw the look and
bothersome you guys.

1526
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,480
That looks like I made
some dope videos though.

1527
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:32,840
I'm about to make a huge
excuse right now too,

1528
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,660
which I don't even know if it's an excuse,

1529
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:39,350
but it's a factor where these like hard,

1530
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:43,180
actual hard times kind of call on you to,

1531
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:45,230
to exercise this kind of will,
you know?

1532
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:48,410
And I think a lot of times
we're not like hard times,

1533
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:51,160
don't call on us like this anyway.
I mean hard times do you know?

1534
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:55,680
But you know what though?
You know what though it,

1535
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:58,040
you should put,

1536
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:01,800
I mean technically and potentially you
should be able to exercise as much.

1537
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:05,910
We'll as it takes really now when
you consider kind of the limit,

1538
01:38:06,240 --> 01:38:09,530
because these are the lemmings are the
limits. This is interesting. This is the,

1539
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:13,440
this is one of the stories where the
guy's like, I'm done. Yeah. He said, okay,

1540
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,770
I'm done. Guys are saying, Hey, if you
stay here, you're going to die. He's like,

1541
01:38:16,771 --> 01:38:20,890
yeah, I cannot move anymore. Then
when you think about, you know what,

1542
01:38:20,891 --> 01:38:24,900
what point are you at when you
cannot save your own life by walking,

1543
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:29,430
you can't walk, can't take another
step. And he came back from that.

1544
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

1545
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:36,270
And they told a really good
job in illustrating it.

1546
01:38:36,390 --> 01:38:38,850
Cause you were talking about it where,

1547
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:43,200
cause you mentioned the no shoes
thing a few times. Yeah he did.

1548
01:38:43,201 --> 01:38:47,530
But again, I bet if, yeah, yeah, he's,

1549
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:48,930
he does a great job,

1550
01:38:49,890 --> 01:38:52,700
but you can't even begin to,

1551
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:58,460
can't even begin to really get the point
across because the way it is as the

1552
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:04,380
leader, I was talking to a guy the other
day that went to buds and didn't make it

1553
01:39:04,381 --> 01:39:05,214
through.
Yeah.

1554
01:39:05,670 --> 01:39:10,170
And I known him for awhile
and I just said like,

1555
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:13,920
hey man, you know, you're
a good dude. You know what,

1556
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:18,870
why did you, why did you quit? And
he said, you know, it just sucked.

1557
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,700
And I was like, okay, but didn't, you know
it was going to suck? And he said, yeah,

1558
01:39:23,701 --> 01:39:28,020
I knew it was going to suck.
But at the same time, you know,

1559
01:39:28,050 --> 01:39:31,500
I watched it on TV and I thought to
myself, okay, yeah, that's going to suck.

1560
01:39:31,530 --> 01:39:35,160
He said. So I, I thought I
understood how it was going to suck,

1561
01:39:35,730 --> 01:39:38,160
but I didn't understand how it was gonna
sound. And there was there, I said,

1562
01:39:38,161 --> 01:39:42,720
this really sucks and he quit.
And again, a good dude, that debt.

1563
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:45,780
I'm kind of, you know,
thinking myself, why?

1564
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:50,160
I'm trying to figure out why people
quit. Yeah. And that was what he said.

1565
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:54,780
He said much like we're saying like as
much as you could imagine and you say to

1566
01:39:54,781 --> 01:39:57,120
yourself, all man, never.
Yeah, but I think I can cook.

1567
01:39:57,121 --> 01:39:59,280
I could make that one more step.
You don't know.

1568
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:02,700
You don't know until you've
been dehydrated. Having
people trying to shoot you,

1569
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:07,890
cleaning up your buddies,
brains off your jacket for weeks,

1570
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,730
months on end, you're dehydrated
and now you have no shoes,

1571
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:13,260
no stockings.

1572
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:18,740
And your march or doing a forced march
on this road for this may march for days

1573
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:24,720
without stopping. What
even is that Tang? Yeah.

1574
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:27,980
Yeah. That's it. I mean,

1575
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,680
this kind of, that's not to
mention like no medical care.

1576
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:38,400
No. Like no one's coming
to save you. You know,

1577
01:40:38,401 --> 01:40:39,870
it's really jacked up
is thinking about this.

1578
01:40:39,871 --> 01:40:44,430
Think if you have an ingrown
toenail. Right, right.

1579
01:40:44,431 --> 01:40:46,650
Like a little thing that is Bob,

1580
01:40:46,710 --> 01:40:50,610
it actually bothers you in
actual life. Yeah. Thank.

1581
01:40:50,710 --> 01:40:54,370
If you had that here or you have a, or
you have, say you got a sprained ankle.

1582
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:58,780
Yeah, a bad sprained ankle. I sprained
my ankle really bad before. Sure.

1583
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:02,590
You can't walk on it.
Well now you don't have a choice.

1584
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:06,490
You either walk on it or you die.
I think about the little things that are,

1585
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:11,320
that caused you an inconvenience right
now and think about what an inconvenience

1586
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:13,090
that is in this situation.

1587
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:16,730
Think about you get a little infection
in your fingers, your fingers year.

1588
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:20,290
You ever had one of those little
stupid like where your fingernail is,

1589
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,610
get a little infection there.

1590
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:25,450
Think about that and that you don't have
no medicine. You don't have any way of,

1591
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:29,590
yeah, that's the things you're going to
turn into in giant infection. You Die.

1592
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:31,331
It's the little,

1593
01:41:31,331 --> 01:41:36,331
little tiny things that annoy you are
will kill you back in the day check.

1594
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:42,250
So what we have to do is
prepare for these hard times.

1595
01:41:42,251 --> 01:41:45,340
Do you have any advice on how we could
help prepare ourselves for these hard

1596
01:41:45,341 --> 01:41:49,600
times on top of
references,

1597
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,740
seeing these scenarios?
I referenced your guys' scenario.

1598
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:58,060
Like basically everything that you guys
guys tell me and talk about like how

1599
01:41:58,061 --> 01:42:00,880
it's super hot,
you don't sleep as much.

1600
01:42:00,881 --> 01:42:03,910
I'm not talking about them talking about
like Ian Ramadi, like all these stuff.

1601
01:42:04,390 --> 01:42:08,700
I kind of imagine that helps. Totally
helps. That's good because it,

1602
01:42:08,730 --> 01:42:12,630
it helps me to think about rifleman
Harris. Yeah, for sure. You too.

1603
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:18,010
Speaking to help. Speaking
of help, help being yourself.

1604
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:21,520
All right,
so you're just in the way,

1605
01:42:21,521 --> 01:42:25,150
this is kind of a dichotomy here cause
you know like when your joints get sore,

1606
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:27,250
I'm talking about Krill oil.
Joining her for a real quick

1607
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:32,600
that you can be spelled in dream luxury.
Yeah.

1608
01:42:32,601 --> 01:42:36,410
You recommend Harris who would've
had Kerlan Jobe warfare. Who knows?

1609
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:41,210
Maybe it wouldn't have stopped that
day. That time. This is pre luxury.

1610
01:42:41,590 --> 01:42:46,390
Yeah. Supreme luxury where now it's
like, hey my joints, I'm getting older.

1611
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:51,040
My joints kind of hurt. I kept,
I can't work out at the gym,

1612
01:42:51,540 --> 01:42:54,610
you know,
at my leisure as good.

1613
01:42:54,820 --> 01:42:59,650
Let me take some joint warfare, you know,
improve my comfort while I work out.

1614
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:03,850
Function for sure function.
But Comfort has has a lot to do with it.

1615
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:07,870
Working out with sore joints is way
less comfortable than not sore joints.

1616
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:12,280
Yeah. I'm going to say though, there's
exercises that you cannot do when you,

1617
01:43:12,281 --> 01:43:14,530
when your joints aren't
ready to rock and roll. Yeah.

1618
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:19,180
So you can push yourself harder and be
better prepared for the hard times if

1619
01:43:19,181 --> 01:43:23,320
you're working correctly, if your
joints are working correctly. Yeah.

1620
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:27,000
That's the dichotomy.
And there also is no

1621
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:30,060
like concession.
There's no,

1622
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:36,330
there's no reason to say, hey, my joints
being less healthy is a good, is fine,

1623
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:40,560
is good. That's a good thing. You
know. So you have a choice. Shouldn't,

1624
01:43:40,620 --> 01:43:45,600
should I maintain or improve this joint,
my joint health,

1625
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:50,220
the health of my body including,
but not limited to joints or should I not?

1626
01:43:50,610 --> 01:43:53,750
The decision should never
be, I'm not, never be,

1627
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,310
I think this was my opinion anyway.
So the point is,

1628
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:02,210
so jock, Lizzie them supplements
joint. So it's for your joints to me,

1629
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:06,020
best kind of supplements as,
as someone who with a level head.

1630
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:08,990
Now as far as supplements goes.

1631
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:14,780
So I think the joint for your joints,
um,

1632
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:17,780
you know,
bones,

1633
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:23,000
maybe stuff that's going to base
structure, structural, structural support.

1634
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:25,940
Because again, and I
said, I said this before,

1635
01:44:25,941 --> 01:44:28,820
like if you're like going for
super cool protein powder,

1636
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,980
a lot of people that say, Hey,
what's a good protein daughter?

1637
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:32,480
Here's the thing you don't stake.

1638
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:37,510
Like how much protein do you like
not get to need supplemental protein.

1639
01:44:39,170 --> 01:44:41,480
You know, people want that
cause it could even convenience.

1640
01:44:42,740 --> 01:44:45,620
That's why people like those very,
very few.

1641
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:50,060
I'm going to make one that's going to
be both convenient and tasty and good.

1642
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:55,190
Alright, there you go nonetheless. That's
cool. I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

1643
01:44:55,220 --> 01:44:59,810
I'm saying as far as like the
importance of focusing on a supplement,

1644
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:01,400
the most benefit.
Okay,

1645
01:45:01,401 --> 01:45:05,900
so your sound lamenting your convenience
then really for sure not supplementing

1646
01:45:05,901 --> 01:45:08,300
protein, you're supplementing
convenience. Nothing wrong with that.

1647
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:10,790
Nothing wrong with that. We've
got a lot to do. I understand.

1648
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:13,700
But as far as like the,
what do you call it,

1649
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:18,650
the hierarchy of suppler Jordan B.

1650
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:22,100
Peterson supplements or the house.
It's hierarchy of supplements,

1651
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,260
like the Krill oil,
Omega threes,

1652
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:30,140
like these kinds of things that
help you directly. That's the,

1653
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:31,730
that's the main ones.
Anyway,

1654
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:37,610
so your point in all this is Josh
also supplements, legit supplements,

1655
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:42,890
Super Krill oil.
Jocko super is what's called Krill oil,

1656
01:45:42,891 --> 01:45:45,380
free joints and joint warfare.

1657
01:45:47,480 --> 01:45:51,530
Where do you get them? Or Gin
main dotcom kit. Thank you, Bro.

1658
01:45:51,531 --> 01:45:55,430
I'm telling you it. I feel like
you're drawing this out way too much.

1659
01:45:56,090 --> 01:46:00,380
Just if I was doing this and be
like, hey, if you want to have good,

1660
01:46:00,381 --> 01:46:02,210
healthy joints,
get some krill oil,

1661
01:46:02,600 --> 01:46:06,560
Krill and get some joint
warfare from origin main.com m.

1662
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:11,000
A. I. N. E. Yeah, but and
then we'd be good. We'd been
moving on the next thing. Yeah,

1663
01:46:11,001 --> 01:46:15,710
no, I dig it and I got the
hierarchy. Here's the thing though.

1664
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:20,120
Dominance. No, this makes
sense. This is relevant

1665
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:25,340
because you're not doing it on a proof
point because it needs to be proven. No,

1666
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:30,380
because back out of your element
again, again, when I was,

1667
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:35,710
we'll say 23 and I'm going to
take some phosphorous something.

1668
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,980
Yeah,

1669
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:44,200
so what if someone listening or group
people listening who have that same

1670
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:48,140
mindset because not
because I knew both things,

1671
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:52,350
I would just just didn't know. Okay,
so I'm going to say no. We know. Yeah.

1672
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,150
Well that's good.
If there's someone that doesn't know that,

1673
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:57,240
maybe they turned this off like
eight minutes ago, maybe, maybe not,

1674
01:46:57,300 --> 01:46:59,610
or maybe they're more educated
now and maybe boom there.

1675
01:46:59,611 --> 01:47:03,180
Now they're looking into
the joint situation. That's
what I think is happening.

1676
01:47:03,570 --> 01:47:05,820
That's my opinion. Hey,
that's my prediction.

1677
01:47:05,910 --> 01:47:08,710
I'm sure Twitter will let us know any way.

1678
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:13,140
The origin main.com on the top click labs.
Actually three in the front page.

1679
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:15,740
I keep forgetting this phrase on
the front page. Boom. Supergirl,

1680
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:19,860
Supergirl and joint warfare kid on it.

1681
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:21,360
There's also some Geezer in rash guards.

1682
01:47:21,361 --> 01:47:25,860
People been asking me years now
what? Gee, should I get? I started.

1683
01:47:25,861 --> 01:47:28,470
You did to with gee, should I
get, we know now we know. No,

1684
01:47:28,500 --> 01:47:31,110
100% all made in America from the cotton,

1685
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:36,111
from the fields of the cotton planted
harvested process about seeds.

1686
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:38,223
Did do.

1687
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:47,100
Yeah. That's an exciting thing. I'm just
saying if you're into that kind of thing,

1688
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:50,250
but nonetheless, you know,
Pete makes it in Maine,

1689
01:47:51,690 --> 01:47:55,620
formulates the fabric. Boom. Geese.
Other stuff too. By the way. Clothing,

1690
01:47:56,180 --> 01:47:59,740
he has more of like a stylish kind
of twist on his clothing. Yeah.

1691
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:05,370
In fact I was, who was it? Oh Dave Burke.
Yeah, we're in Utah. Had the origin,

1692
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,510
the Hoodie and the Hoodie has like,
I don't know if you know this kid's stuff,

1693
01:48:09,640 --> 01:48:14,640
but like there's certain cuts of like
goodies and stuff and even though it's

1694
01:48:14,981 --> 01:48:19,500
like my daughter's XL. Yeah. Yeah. I
see it goes beyond that. No brother.

1695
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:21,770
Yes it does. Anyway, Mike,

1696
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:24,470
you know it's noticeable for people
who want to notice it nonetheless.

1697
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:27,270
Notice that I'm going to dance
group did what? He was like, Dang,

1698
01:48:27,271 --> 01:48:31,500
that's a good like that's a good hoodie
and it's just a pullover. Come on Dave.

1699
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:36,150
Hey, it's something, it's not
nothing pumpkin. Nonetheless,

1700
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:40,800
it's all made in America and there is a
little stylish twist if you're there to

1701
01:48:40,801 --> 01:48:41,340
notice,

1702
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:46,340
if you care to notice has some
fashion style baked in there.

1703
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:49,610
If you don't notice you to notice
cause he you, you ever wore the,

1704
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:53,730
you wear the Hoodie, right?
Functional warm to kept me warm.

1705
01:48:54,450 --> 01:48:57,060
I'm not used to 19 degrees
like it was in Utah.

1706
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:02,850
I don't think I've ever been in 19
I was but I had that Hoodie on help.

1707
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:06,620
You guys had these biggest cortex check.
It's

1708
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,560
nonetheless all the stuff on origin
main.com is made in America from cs of the

1709
01:49:13,561 --> 01:49:18,561
cotton all the way till the
final garment you wearing.

1710
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:22,020
Yup. Yup. Good one. Check
out this stuff on there.

1711
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:27,050
Good way to support also
in your fitness routines.

1712
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:33,630
If you want to expand out of
like just basic hey bench squat,

1713
01:49:33,631 --> 01:49:38,130
burpees, dead lifts. What else? Basic.

1714
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:41,310
Once you pull up to if you want to expand,
do some like cool,

1715
01:49:41,311 --> 01:49:45,330
interesting stuff on it.
Dot Com slash Jocko go there.

1716
01:49:45,331 --> 01:49:48,400
They've got some cool fitness
gear, kettle bells, which are,

1717
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,090
they got all the kettlebells including
the artistic ones. Those are cool.

1718
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:55,600
I think those are all the ones that
have just artistic ones. Check it,

1719
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:58,360
makes it funner.
Put a little twist on it and do,

1720
01:49:58,361 --> 01:50:01,090
you can mix up your workout
as far as creativity,

1721
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:04,930
which keeps it fun for some people,
not Jocko. Some people though,

1722
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:08,920
if you vary the workout
like new movements,

1723
01:50:09,910 --> 01:50:13,810
new functional movements, if you will, um,

1724
01:50:13,870 --> 01:50:15,070
you're more likely to stick with it.

1725
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:17,140
Stay on the path and
make the path enjoyable.

1726
01:50:17,141 --> 01:50:22,141
Sometimes don't just neglect the

golf clubs, podcast equipment. Recently,

1738
01:51:09,221 --> 01:51:12,340
a lot of people have been hitting me up
saying, Hey, I'm going to start a podcast.

1739
01:51:12,341 --> 01:51:15,970
What's the equipment, you know, I
should get, they asked me that too.

1740
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:21,940
Yeah, no wonder I just talk.
Yes. You press record. Yes.

1741
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:27,070
And I got the equipment so I had that
knowledge and excited about that. Are We?

1742
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:32,100
So having knowledge is better than not
having the knowledge in whatever regard.

1743
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:37,150
Nonetheless, if you're gonna buy a podcast
equipment, carry on, do that stuff.

1744
01:51:37,990 --> 01:51:40,330
But yeah, click through this.
Good, good way to support.

1745
01:51:40,930 --> 01:51:45,790
Also subscribe to the podcast.
If you haven't already on stitcher iTunes,

1746
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:49,510
obviously Google play.
Spotify confirmed.

1747
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:55,000
It seems weird that I didn't know
that for sure. Dude. Real weird.

1748
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,600
Here's the thing.
So many things that weird.

1749
01:51:58,601 --> 01:52:00,080
We need to talk about it for a minute.

1750
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:08,350
I guess I can. You know what?
You're right. It's just me
expressing myself. Look,

1751
01:52:08,351 --> 01:52:12,340
all you got to know. Spotify confirmed
troopers out there confirmed it to me.

1752
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:16,840
And that's really the good
thing about people interacting.

1753
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:21,710
Yes it is. You learn a lot about
yourself and your own situation.

1754
01:52:21,711 --> 01:52:25,030
You know things that you don't know
cause they're detached and they have

1755
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:29,200
different expertise by the way.
In a lot of ways. Most ways.

1756
01:52:29,740 --> 01:52:33,310
Anyway, subscribe. If you haven't
already. Also subscribe on Youtube.

1757
01:52:33,311 --> 01:52:34,330
This excerpts on there.

1758
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:38,200
If you don't want to listen to or if
you don't want to necessarily watch the

1759
01:52:38,201 --> 01:52:42,310
whole episode video
version of this podcast,

1760
01:52:42,340 --> 01:52:45,100
you can just get little
excerpts taking share,

1761
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:49,100
watch or even come back to.
That's a big one.

1762
01:52:49,700 --> 01:52:52,760
We've put out so much that it's too much.

1763
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:56,630
People can't absorb it all the first
time round. Yeah. Wait, what do you mean?

1764
01:52:56,690 --> 01:52:58,760
Like the whole episode
you mean? No, no, no.

1765
01:52:59,420 --> 01:53:03,710
What was on episode 63 people when
people don't remember that thing,

1766
01:53:03,711 --> 01:53:05,750
they may be so you just like Jujitsu,

1767
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:09,200
you go listen and you learn it again and
now you'd now it's more recognizable.

1768
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:12,640
Yeah. So it's like drilling
a little bit. Yeah.

1769
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:16,790
It's like you're going to come back. I'm
going to drill somewhere. Yeah. And some,

1770
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:20,150
you know how like certain things
just apply to you more like if your,

1771
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:22,340
your advice on, I dunno,
college, that's easy.

1772
01:53:22,341 --> 01:53:26,060
One to remember about how to approach
college, right. Crush college or whatever.

1773
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:29,960
It's gonna apply to me more if
I'm actually in college, you know,

1774
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:34,250
versus just apply that to other things
in life would you can easily do for sure,

1775
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,400
but that's going to apply to
me directly. We'll say, oh,

1776
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:41,120
you know more than maybe the next guy.
So that kind of stuff where

1777
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:45,470
that one I want to remember. Okay,
I'm going to come back to that one.

1778
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:50,300
If I can constantly remind myself of
the things that directly apply to me,

1779
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:50,960
you can be more,

1780
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,750
it's going to be more beneficial rather
than just linking to all the podcasts

1781
01:53:53,751 --> 01:53:57,620
and hoping you remember each one.
Nonetheless, point there is that it.

1782
01:53:57,680 --> 01:54:02,450
That's a good reason to subscribe to
the Youtube Channel. So if you, in fact,

1783
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:06,770
if the excerpts or some
excerpts resonate with you,

1784
01:54:08,060 --> 01:54:11,540
you got them there at your
fingertips and you can share. Also,

1785
01:54:12,680 --> 01:54:17,680
Jack was a store it called Jocko store
Jocko store.com that's the URL there

1786
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:18,110
there.

1787
01:54:18,110 --> 01:54:22,160
That's where you can get if
you want shirts because you
don't even know what you

1788
01:54:22,161 --> 01:54:25,220
are Alizea anymore. Of
course they do. You think so?

1789
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:28,880
I think that's common language. No,
actually no, I think you're right.

1790
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:33,200
Just call it the website. Website. Yeah.
The website website, URL stand for to see,

1791
01:54:33,201 --> 01:54:36,770
well I don't even know. Here's the
thing I knew that I forgot. No,

1792
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:39,830
I'm actually not a tech
guy. Yeah, but you knew it.

1793
01:54:41,630 --> 01:54:46,040
I knew what it meant. I don't
know what it stands for. I Dunno.

1794
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:51,050
Universal home. Ask your brother. I know
where it's probably not even universal.

1795
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:55,340
J Charles.
Nonetheless it's Jocko.

1796
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:58,280
The website is Jocko store.com.

1797
01:54:58,350 --> 01:55:03,170
I'm not that creative but easy to
remember and that's where he can get the

1798
01:55:03,171 --> 01:55:06,530
shirts. Hoodies, rash guards,

1799
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:08,480
compression rash guards if you will.

1800
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,050
We're very selective cities where
you maintain range of motion.

1801
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:17,800
Jujitsu specifically in my opinion,
uh,

1802
01:55:18,090 --> 01:55:20,940
what he's on their hoodies, all the
hoodies. They're the same design but the,

1803
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:22,970
there are the heavy ones.
People have been asking me like,

1804
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:24,020
are these the heavy ones are,

1805
01:55:24,021 --> 01:55:27,980
where's the heavy hoodies
ones we saw like the,

1806
01:55:27,981 --> 01:55:30,740
the non heavy ones, we'll
call them. I've got therapy.

1807
01:55:31,340 --> 01:55:34,560
The first kind of
iteration. Exactly. Well,

1808
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:38,900
those were all sold out.
They sold out last year.

1809
01:55:39,830 --> 01:55:44,830
And so I did another iteration
with your for the heaviest there.

1810
01:55:45,220 --> 01:55:46,170
They're the heaviest one.

1811
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:50,720
Actually I think there might be
some industrial heavier one. Maybe.

1812
01:55:51,260 --> 01:55:55,860
No, because I think that was
then he, I dunno, I forget.

1813
01:55:55,890 --> 01:56:00,330
Nonetheless. These are
the heavy ones. Confirm,

1814
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:03,700
double confirm. I'm also so
women's stuff on there. Uh,

1815
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:08,610
I think I'm going to add a few
things before Christmas on the store.

1816
01:56:10,200 --> 01:56:12,840
So if you want,
keep your eyes on that.

1817
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:17,520
That's a good way to support. If you want
something, get something, check them out.

1818
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:19,020
Also,
psychological warfare.

1819
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:21,480
If you didn't know what that is
until it's an album with tracks,

1820
01:56:21,600 --> 01:56:23,670
Jocko talking on these tracks,

1821
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:31,020
basically you listen to them when you are,
you know,

1822
01:56:31,230 --> 01:56:35,940
on the path we'll say on the path
and you get moments of weakness,

1823
01:56:35,941 --> 01:56:39,000
days of weakness, you know,
those, you're not feeling like it.

1824
01:56:39,630 --> 01:56:40,940
You know how you always talk about like,

1825
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,090
it doesn't matter if you feel like you're
not, you just do it. Okay, let's do it.

1826
01:56:44,130 --> 01:56:48,180
Okay. So, uh, and I respect that and
that's where we all want to want to be.

1827
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:49,290
We all want to be there,

1828
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:55,830
but for some of us it's not
like that 100% of the time.

1829
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:58,080
Sometimes when you really
don't feel like it.

1830
01:56:58,081 --> 01:57:03,000
Sometimes when I really don't
feel like it, I just don't do it,

1831
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:05,100
man.
Sometimes I gotta be honest.

1832
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:10,140
We'll put on psychological warfare and
you'll do it. Yes, like a spot, you know,

1833
01:57:10,141 --> 01:57:14,520
especially a spa. This is where it's
like a no brainer. Like really easy.

1834
01:57:15,870 --> 01:57:19,370
When you, you're like contemplating
when you're like, he's,

1835
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:22,360
I could just do this tomorrow. Right.
And you start making deals with yourself.

1836
01:57:22,361 --> 01:57:26,390
Do you ever do that? Deals with
myself. The weak part of it.

1837
01:57:26,570 --> 01:57:31,570
It's like you don't so straight up
Jocko Jocko like I don't feel like it,

1838
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:35,720
I feel like it,
whatever gain,

1839
01:57:37,070 --> 01:57:41,910
I get pissed at myself at yourself.
If I start leaning towards like, oh,

1840
01:57:41,911 --> 01:57:46,110
maybe I just won't do anything.
No. Oh really? Really how
it is. That's how, okay,

1841
01:57:46,111 --> 01:57:50,910
cool. We're going to go smash. You know?
It's real funny. That doesn't surprise.

1842
01:57:51,030 --> 01:57:55,840
I've witnessed that with
you. Like we'll be like,

1843
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:57,750
ah,
I don't know if we can kind of do that.

1844
01:57:57,751 --> 01:58:01,230
Then you get this sort of look this kind
of way about you kind of like, wait,

1845
01:58:01,231 --> 01:58:06,231
did I just say that echoes going on
vacation and he's going to be gone for a

1846
01:58:07,620 --> 01:58:10,860
couple of weeks and I've been
real busy with all kinds of stuff.

1847
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:15,920
And we were talking about if we'd be
able to actually get all these podcasts

1848
01:58:16,351 --> 01:58:21,180
done and I didn't think we could do
it. And so I said, hey, echo, you know,

1849
01:58:21,181 --> 01:58:25,410
we're just gonna have to take, you know,
no, no podcast for a few weeks. And then,

1850
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:30,310
um, then I said, actually, I, like
a day went by and I said, I said,

1851
01:58:30,330 --> 01:58:34,350
echo a text that said, uh, actually
we're going to do it in your corn,

1852
01:58:34,351 --> 01:58:36,060
all the podcasts.
I'm going to prep for them all.

1853
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:39,510
We're going to have an all nighter
and we'll just get it done.

1854
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:44,410
Bring some red bull and get some
great some Jocko white tea. Yeah.

1855
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:50,220
Well what was interesting about that is
when you said that you had this kind of

1856
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:53,950
tone of like Dang, like term it
like, Whoa, we got to take a break.

1857
01:58:53,951 --> 01:58:57,130
We've got to take a break after two
years by the way, every single week,

1858
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,660
by the way,
we got to take a break.

1859
01:59:01,720 --> 01:59:06,400
That's what you said. Yeah. And right
when you, and I was like, cool. I dig it.

1860
01:59:06,750 --> 01:59:10,570
I mean I'm not saying good, I'm
saying cool. I I totally understand.

1861
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:12,070
And you know what?
That makes sense.

1862
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:17,830
Hbo Big Company takes huge breaks.

1863
01:59:18,370 --> 01:59:19,630
Everybody takes huge breaks.

1864
01:59:19,631 --> 01:59:24,631
Everybody takes parent and
you're over here two years in,

1865
01:59:25,390 --> 01:59:27,640
no breaks, no breaks,
no matter what. Okay.

1866
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:30,980
So they'll come a time when we are
forced to for some reason. Yeah.

1867
01:59:31,150 --> 01:59:34,840
That's kind of part of the point
bro. So I'm like, cool, I dig it.

1868
01:59:34,930 --> 01:59:38,350
I totally understand Jocko.
And when I said that,

1869
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:43,000
that's when your face kind of shifted,
like kind of you went into your own world.

1870
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:46,510
Did I just say that? Like, it's almost
like you sorta got mad. Real subtle,

1871
01:59:46,570 --> 01:59:49,390
but it was there and I was like,
oh, we're not taking a break.

1872
01:59:49,420 --> 01:59:54,370
I know docker is going to come back
nonetheless. And I'm sure that I'm like,

1873
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:59,380
okay, so I dig it. But back
to psychological warfare.

1874
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:00,520
If you

1875
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:05,230
need a spot or even want a spot

1876
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:10,450
with those times that you're like,
maybe I'll skip the workout,

1877
02:00:10,720 --> 02:00:13,090
maybe I'll slip in the dive minute.
Just listen to any track.

1878
02:00:13,120 --> 02:00:17,080
And the track is labeled, you know,
where if you can skip on the diet,

1879
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:20,890
it's like just sugarcoated. Like wait,
what is it? Sure. But it's something,

1880
02:00:20,891 --> 02:00:24,880
something's sugarcoated, lies.
Sure. Recording. It's just so, yeah.

1881
02:00:24,881 --> 02:00:29,400
So he listened to that. And then what's
good is it's not some inspirational, Eh,

1882
02:00:29,550 --> 02:00:33,120
you can do it. It's not that. It's
like it's pragmatic here to do that.

1883
02:00:33,460 --> 02:00:37,140
Here's the thing though, you, but just
by nature, your tone of voice kind of,

1884
02:00:37,250 --> 02:00:41,800
kind of like by happenstance
inserts that concept in it.

1885
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:46,750
So it's kind of a double double thing as
it turns out. But primarily it's just,

1886
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:51,550
it's a pragmatic thing. Think about,
think about this logical stuff.

1887
02:00:51,820 --> 02:00:54,670
And then at the end of the truck
he kind of conclude that, oh yeah,

1888
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:57,640
it's going to get after
it. Yeah, exactly right.

1889
02:00:57,641 --> 02:01:01,990
That's what psychological warfare
is. It is on iTunes, Amazon music,

1890
02:01:02,650 --> 02:01:07,150
Google play, wherever you can
get MP, three s mp3s, true
story. Anyway, to support.

1891
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:08,080
Also,

1892
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:12,370
you get Jocko white tea and if you're
having trouble dead lifting less than a

1893
02:01:12,370 --> 02:01:13,330
thousand pounds,
if you get Jocko white tea,

1894
02:01:13,331 --> 02:01:15,210
that would be solved immediately and your,

1895
02:01:15,211 --> 02:01:19,390
your dead lift will then be 8,000
pounds, including uh, Jordan B.

1896
02:01:19,390 --> 02:01:20,920
Peterson who can now dead
lift a thousand pounds.

1897
02:01:20,921 --> 02:01:23,320
He broke through his 7,000 pounds.
Yup.

1898
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:26,350
Cat barrier barrier books.

1899
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:30,430
I got some books way the
warrior kid number one. Um,

1900
02:01:30,820 --> 02:01:33,250
don't let your kid be a wimpy kid.
Why would you do that?

1901
02:01:33,320 --> 02:01:35,920
Or why would you let your neighbors could
be a wimpy kid? Why would you do that?

1902
02:01:36,910 --> 02:01:40,070
Get them on the path way the warrior kid

1903
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:43,970
path stronger, faster, smarter,
better. It gets some extreme ownership.

1904
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:48,971
The new edition is out and thanks to
you all because we added questions.

1905
02:01:51,590 --> 02:01:56,590
Your questions from this
podcast into an appendix inside.

1906
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:02,900
Not every question, but uh,
a bunch of them. Oh, good
amount. So they're in there.

1907
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:08,060
There's also a new Ford and some new color
pictures. Color pictures. Interesting.

1908
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:12,620
Yeah. Cause I don't like color pictures.
I said no dichotomy. They said,

1909
02:02:12,621 --> 02:02:15,510
well this is more premium. I said,
no, black and white is between users.

1910
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,970
So anyways, if you want to see
what I looked like in color

1911
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:26,360
then you can get the book. But the w
two to offset that, I said okay fine.

1912
02:02:26,361 --> 02:02:28,640
You want to put color pictures in there,
make the whole book black.

1913
02:02:28,670 --> 02:02:32,870
So that's what they did. Make the
whole book black and that was that end.

1914
02:02:32,871 --> 02:02:34,100
Speaking of black also.

1915
02:02:35,010 --> 02:02:35,430
Yeah,

1916
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:40,200
the discipline equals freedom field
manual is available worldwide.

1917
02:02:41,610 --> 02:02:46,350
And I told you about that tagline that
the publisher wanted to have like the um,

1918
02:02:46,530 --> 02:02:50,340
this book is a superb differ for the
holiday season. And I told them no,

1919
02:02:52,080 --> 02:02:56,090
the tag line is,
there's no better gift than disappointed.

1920
02:02:57,270 --> 02:02:57,870
Yeah.

1921
02:02:57,870 --> 02:02:59,880
That's the truth. You
know, it's actually true.

1922
02:03:00,030 --> 02:03:01,620
If you could give someone
the gift of discipline,

1923
02:03:01,621 --> 02:03:04,050
would you not be giving them
the best gift in life? Yes.

1924
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:07,740
Now you can actually give them the
gift of discipline equals freedom field

1925
02:03:07,741 --> 02:03:08,940
manual so you can do that.

1926
02:03:09,180 --> 02:03:14,180
Now this is important because people
keep asking me the field manual audio

1927
02:03:14,701 --> 02:03:18,630
version, discipline equals freedom
field manual is it is also on iTunes,

1928
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,370
Amazon music, Google play, other MP3
platforms. It's available right now.

1929
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,520
It is not on audible. Audible
is not with tracks. No,

1930
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:29,250
we wanted an album with tracks.

1931
02:03:29,330 --> 02:03:33,930
It's why we did it this way for something
on top of the books and the podcast.

1932
02:03:33,931 --> 02:03:38,580
If you need leadership
training and execution at your
business or with your team,

you have questions for us or you have

1936
02:03:53,921 --> 02:03:56,830

A couple of questions I asked today,

1937
02:03:57,340 --> 02:04:01,360
you can communicate with us
on the interwebs, on Twitter,

on Instagram and on Duffy.

1939
02:04:06,410 --> 02:04:11,410
Echo is that Echo Charles and I am at
Jocko Willink and to the service men and

1940
02:04:11,801 --> 02:04:15,340
women out there right
now holding the line,

1941
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:20,430
slogging through the mud and the
heat and the danger and the fear.

1942
02:04:23,330 --> 02:04:27,830
Thank you for defending us
and our freedoms and to the
police, law enforcement,

1943
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:31,790
firefighters, paramedics
are there. First responders.

1944
02:04:32,450 --> 02:04:34,700
Thanks for living the life that you live,

1945
02:04:34,701 --> 02:04:37,440
which allows us to live the life we live.

1946
02:04:40,260 --> 02:04:42,300
And to everyone else that's listening,

1947
02:04:42,810 --> 02:04:45,870
just remember that you
might not be wearing a cape,

1948
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:48,480
you might not have any magic powers,

1949
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:53,610
but you have the ultimate
power and that is human will.

1950
02:04:55,480 --> 02:04:58,660
The power to march,
to fight,

1951
02:05:00,220 --> 02:05:04,440
to overcome
and to get after it.

1952
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:11,120
So until next time,
this is echo n Jocko out.
