00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,040
The w when you, what you
mentioned about bravery, this,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:07,530
how you were talking
with Sam Harris about it,

3
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:12,210
where braveries only present
if you are scared of something.

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:13,230
Because if you're not scared of it,

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:16,560
you're not being brave to overcome
anything or to to go, you know,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:21,810
to do any kind of activity that's um,
you know, they, that you're scared of.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,770
So the very,

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,980
although I don't know if I necessarily
agree with that because there's guys that

9
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:31,700
are, you know, he's says he's never
seen anyone that's not not afraid.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,300
I seen some pretty cool,

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,620
I mean it's almost the word he uses our
crazy guys that are just so brave in do

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,300
you look at them and they, you,
you go, this guy is going to sky.

13
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,320
I had guys with me, you
know, in my task unit and

14
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:55,030
some of those guys were sole brave
that I didn't think they were going to

15
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,970
Megan home. And is it,
cause they were like, um,

16
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:06,470
it's like they, they weren't scared
to die at all. Like you didn't, yeah.

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,570
And,
and

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,970
you see the,

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,640
almost a lack of self
preservation. Right. You know, not,

20
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:19,810
not stupid, not, not
suicidal, but like, oh,

21
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:21,720
this guy doesn't think he can be killed.
You know,

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,640
we were talking about that
on the last podcast on,

23
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:27,700
and I forget the name of the major
that was on the beach landing at Toro,

24
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:31,400
I think. And he's up and he's like, Hey,
look, they can't hit me. Come on. Yeah, I,

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,710
I've seen guys do that.

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,650
Yeah.
So

27
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,900
as far as actual bravery goes though,
so would you consider that.
