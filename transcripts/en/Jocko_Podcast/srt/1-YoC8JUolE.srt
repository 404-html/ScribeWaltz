00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,190
This is Jocko podcast number
one 54 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,170
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,950
Good evening and we are going to
go into some Q and a today. Sure.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,300
We've got a bunch of
questions to go through.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,340
I asked if anyone on Twitter had
questions and I got a ton of them so we're

6
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:21,600
going to try and answer some of them.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,640
Some people if you're listening and you
asked a question like what time do I go

8
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,641
to bed or what kind of workout
do I do or something like that,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,620
then I'm not going to answer
it now because I've answered
a bunch of other times.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,340
There's a lot of fundamental things or
it's in the discipline equals freedom

11
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,040
field manual or you know.

12
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,060
So these were some questions
that had some of them yeah,

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,570
that we've heard some of them before.
Maybe there's a different spin, but um,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,080
some of them I tried to pull back or
pull out the fresher type questions for

15
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,630
this and ones that aren't entirely fresh.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,660
I'll try and cover very briefly with
whatever the new sort of angle is because

17
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:11,160
there is, there is a fact that, you know,

18
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,820
you go to a class and you learn two or
three new moves in Jujitsu and that's

19
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,181
good,

20
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:20,181
but you also review just to just to
arm lock and that is still beneficial,

21
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,750
especially if it's from a new angle or
a new instructor. They tell you, hey,

22
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:24,961
you know,

23
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:28,440
you move your hand a little bit further
out on their wrist if you're going for

24
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:33,440
that thing and it helps you. Sure. So
there's little little details. Yeah.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,510
Yeah. Cool. So let's rock and roll.
Cool. All right. First question,

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,690
can you describe how difficult or no
factor leaving your family was before

27
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:46,880
deployment? I hate leaving. Okay. Let
me just answer that one. Yeah, it sucks.

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,470
Leave your family before deployment.
That's the way it is.

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,420
One thing that I've always said is, you
know, two guys that were saying, oh,

30
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,710
I got it, I'm gonna leave my kids and
it's horrible to leave. And I'm like, Yup,

31
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,400
it is. And they worry about
it from the kids' perspective.

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,670
I'm not going to be around, you
know, well, here's the deal.

33
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,990
Men have been leaving to go and fight
wars and do what they gotta do for

34
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,800
thousands of years.

35
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:19,370
And so your kids are going
to be okay and what good is,

36
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,450
they will see what you're doing,

37
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,540
see your service and your sacrifice and
you stepping up and holding the line for

38
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:27,600
the nation.

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,590
And that will be a lesson that
they will learn by observation.

40
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,830
And so even they'll be sad.
But inside they're learning.

41
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,740
They're learning that there's
things more important than yourself.

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,950
And so it's a good lesson
to be taught. A yes. Is it,

43
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,870
is it horrible to leave your family?
It sure is.

44
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,990
But it is a lesson for your kids and it
is a sacrifice you're making for your

45
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:56,880
country. And there is,

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,010
there are benefits to it. You know, your,

47
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,820
you get to come home and you'll see
and you'll see your kids, you know,

48
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,590
be all excited and it's good. It's a
good thing. So that's question one. Yes,

49
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,730
it's harsh, but it's a
worthy, it's a worthy cause.

50
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,130
Yeah.
A kind of second part to the question,

51
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,900
did you cry when you learned that your
childhood friend committed to the side

52
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,720
while you were doing that?

53
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,640
But, okay. Yeah,

54
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:29,641
so I mentioned that on a couple of
podcasts ago that my friend Jeff killed

55
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:33,280
himself while I was going through buds.
He was a kid I'd grown up with, but I had,

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,360
I had grown apart from him in
the later grades, sixth, seventh,

57
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:42,330
eighth grade into high school. We kind of
grew apart. Uh, so I did not, you know,

58
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,060
I was, you know, I was, I was sad
by the situation, but I didn't,

59
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,410
I wasn't super emotional
about it because I, we had,

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,270
we had kind of grown apart
and it had been, you know, I
was now in the navy, so, no,

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,380
didn't, uh, cry, but was definitely
a sad about the situation.

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,680
It didn't, I mean, kind of back to
that first part, but leaving, um,

63
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,830
is it like that, like a healthy dose of
that, like good for the kids? For sure.

64
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,680
Because it's like now they
know how to make, do you know,

65
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:16,760
like if dad's there for every little
thing kind of thing. Sure. Um, and then,

66
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:20,600
you know, the, the inevitable day comes
that you're going to go, you know,

67
00:04:20,601 --> 00:04:22,490
leave or the air, at least
they got to leave. You know,

68
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,240
you don't have to depend on
kind of dead being there.

69
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,540
The trials and tribulations and,
and those things,

70
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,650
adversity will make kids tougher.
That's just the bottom line.

71
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,620
So this is a adversity and it's an
adversity that kids, you know, they,

72
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:42,980
they don't make them tougher. Make him
stronger. Yes. Agree. Next question.

73
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,400
Any good recommendations
for cutting back on alcohol?

74
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,330
Um, you know, just straight up. Why,

75
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:55,710
why would you cut back and not just
stop? At this point in my life, I don't,

76
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:57,780
I don't drink anymore.
Um,

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,500
and I know that some people
have an alcohol problem and
so I think trying to cut

78
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:07,920
back if you have an alcohol problem isn't
a realistic thing to do because you'll

79
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:12,120
take that slippery slope
and, and just get drunk. Uh,

80
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,670
so I think what you
have to do is just stop.

81
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,530
And I know that. And again, I, I, I'm not,

82
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,461
I don't,

83
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:25,080
I don't have a good familiarization to
know what it's like to be addicted to

84
00:05:25,081 --> 00:05:29,700
alcohol. I didn't even, I didn't
even really like consciously,

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,650
oh I'm going to stop drinking now.

86
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,040
I just stopped drinking
because I was out of the navy.

87
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,930
I was working a bunch and carrying
on and wasn't around those, you know,

88
00:05:39,931 --> 00:05:41,880
my bros anymore where we'd
go out and have a beer.

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,630
And so if that's not happening,
then it's not happening.

90
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,050
And that's one thing I'll say is I know
that people that have alcohol issues,

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,170
addictions, they always say
you got to change the people,

92
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:58,070
places and things that you do. So
the, that you hang around with, I like

93
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,510
to drink.
You can't hang around with them.

94
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,280
The place that you go where
everyone likes to drink,

95
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,330
you can't go to those places.

96
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,570
The things that you like to
do that involve drinking,
you can't do those things.

97
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,030
So there you go.
I would say stop drinking and hey,

98
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:11,811
if you're an alcoholic,

99
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,930
you got to get medical supervision cause
that's actually you can die if you're

100
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:17,540
an alcoholic and you stopped
drinking. Yeah. So you have to,

101
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,740
you have to like go and
get help. Uh, but stop.

102
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,110
Yeah.
A lot of those times,

103
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:28,760
those people who are that far into
alcoholism where they stopped drinking and

104
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
they die, that's like usually they
don't even want to stop drinking.

105
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,350
Usually that's just how
I'm drinking usually.

106
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,300
But I think I might have more
experience in this one than you,

107
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,560
but all those things, I mean that's
like a really concise in, in, in uh,

108
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,870
it's, that's a good way to put, to put
it like the people placing and things,

109
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,530
right. Activities, whatever.
Um, but a big part of it,

110
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,710
and I said this before where a big
part where I would stop drinking,

111
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,940
it was way easier when I just understood
what it was, you know, like understood.

112
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:02,450
Like what,

113
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,620
why am I just wanting to drink and
why is it that when I start drinking,

114
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,650
like it's kind of harder to stop,
you know?

115
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,290
Then maybe at another next guy
or whatever. And then when I,

116
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,220
once I understood like what's
happening physiologically or whatever,

117
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,570
I came up with my own little strategy
and the big part of it was like, Oh yeah,

118
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:25,430
like my brain is like tricking me into
thinking like, yeah, that you want this,

119
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,570
this thing or whatever.

120
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,590
That was like a major one and the other
one was kind of has to do with the

121
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:35,150
people placing things. It was um,
where if I had a reason not to drink,

122
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,110
like if I had a workout that I really
took seriously the next day or if I was

123
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:43,070
going to record or something dude to
do something where to be hung over or

124
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,900
whatever would really mess me up.
Um, it'd be way easier, you know,

125
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:51,170
so back like, you know, in high,
not high school, but in college,

126
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,610
like in athletics and stuff like that,

127
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,940
you never really drink during the week
cause he had practice the next day.

128
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,300
You don't want to be hung over and
practice, you know, so it'd be real easy.

129
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,900
Oh yeah,
I'm going to drinking today kind of thing.

130
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:04,310
So if you can kind of set up your life
where you have like something important

131
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,300
that you can kind of look forward to
and really care about the outcome of

132
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,260
something that's not necessarily mundane
and you're in your mind because a lot

133
00:08:12,261 --> 00:08:15,320
of times that'll kind of, it's a
slippery slope when you're like, yeah,

134
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,900
it's important, but it's mundane
in your life. You'd be like,

135
00:08:17,901 --> 00:08:21,070
let's see how I can endure it kind
of hung over. It's kind of worth it.

136
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,050
I'll pay the price now, you
know kind of thing. But yeah,

137
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,490
if you can set up your life where you,

138
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:31,510
you have something that you find like
important to be functioning fully that

139
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:35,780
helps Jujitsu train Jujitsu on Saturdays.
Yeah,

140
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:39,320
it affected me when I was in the teams
and we'd go out and drink it on Friday

141
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,140
and then when I started training
Jujitsu all the time, I didn't want to,

142
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,000
I wanted to be good to go
for Jujitsu. Sorry. Yeah,

143
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,870
I just like started started to stop
drinking on Friday nights hard.

144
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,790
I would see this with Jujitsu. I would
say compete in Jujitsu then because,

145
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,800
and I don't know, people are
different. You, there's a
spectrum, but to me, did you,

146
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,870
I mean I'll train hung over do you do to,
in fact you did.

147
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:04,830
So the helps the hangover if you
can drag yourself out of the house,

148
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,370
which is actually isn't that hard
once you do it once, if you go,

149
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,520
if you're hung up and you're like, oh
man, I really don't feel like right now,

150
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,700
but you just do it the first time
you do it, that's the hardest time.

151
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,530
Every other time you're like, yeah,
I did this before. This is easy.

152
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,340
I'm not going to be suffering.
You Go, you know, depending on,

153
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,530
depending on the level of hangover you're
going to suffer in Jujitsu or maybe

154
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,730
not after a while you get used to
it. I don't know, maybe sweating.

155
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,650
I was training like at
a higher level and I,

156
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,290
I mean like [inaudible] not trying
to be like a jerk, but like I would,

157
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,380
this is back when I was training train
with Fabio and so dean and I would show

158
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:38,580
up when we trained for like three
hours straight and like hard.

159
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,970
And so if you're going to come
in and do four rounds, yeah,

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,320
you're a little hung over,
it's no big deal.

161
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,770
But if you're going to come in and
you're going to train for, for, you know,

162
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,100
an hour worth of class, then you're
going to roll hardcore for for two hours.

163
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,810
You're not going to trust me.

164
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,760
You're not going to want to be all hung
over dehydrated and jacked up mentally.

165
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,360
Yeah, I dig it. And if you're
going to train fat hard, then yeah,

166
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,610
don't you probably.
It's going to be hard to drink.

167
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,640
That's your typical person is
not going to train that hard.

168
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,900
I mean probably because they're drinking
too much. If your competitor, no,

169
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,810
even people who don't drink don't train
that hard. Typically in my experience,

170
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:17,100
I don't know. But if you're training
for a tournament, it's going to,

171
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,470
you didn't take it way more seriously,
just kinda in the back of your mind,

172
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:22,710
you know, it's not just like, oh,
did you use the training? So again,

173
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:26,820
I'm not saying that's not gonna work if
you're just practicing so it won't work.

174
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:28,500
I'm not saying that,
I'm saying people are different.

175
00:10:28,501 --> 00:10:33,120
And if I use myself as an example,
like I could, I could train,

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,530
I could hang a brows I was training
with like when I'd go train,

177
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:40,410
like at autos or whatever with
these crazy training sessions. Yeah,

178
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:44,670
it would go slightly hungover.
Go Dean every Friday. So,

179
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,090
okay, look, of course I could
probably train better if,

180
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,470
if I didn't drink the night before
for sure, but I'm just saying as a,

181
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,080
as a catalyst for stopping drinking,
that didn't help you.

182
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,400
It didn't help me as much as it
me. Yeah. And it didn't even,

183
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,990
it wasn't even like a catalyst
to help me stop drinking.

184
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,800
It was just the functionality
of life. Yes, it was, oh,

185
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,860
I've got to do this in the morning.
Cool.

186
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,800
I'm not going to get all hammered tonight
so I can do better as a human. Yeah.

187
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,080
And that's really the format right there
where you find something. I mean to me,

188
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,460
you know, like you're not like Jujitsu,
just the training. If I wasn't,

189
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,850
if I was competing, oh, I'd
easily stopped drinking easily,

190
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,600
but just for the train, if I didn't have
a competition or whatever, it wasn't,

191
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,020
it wasn't,
it didn't help as much as one might think.

192
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,460
But if I had something like, you
know, if we're recording or something,

193
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,520
something that you would think
you might be able to even,

194
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,880
it just depends on how important it is
for you to be functioning at the best

195
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:45,360
self that you can. You know, if I get
tapped out a few more times in Jujitsu,

196
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,290
it's kind of like, hey, whatever.

197
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,180
So it just depends on who
you are is what I'm saying.

198
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,100
Either way. Yeah, man. I think that

199
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,850
helps, but that's going to be hard. Um,

200
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,920
either way if you don't have some kind
of like format scaffolding in your brain

201
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:05,170
to like a plan, you know, like a
little strategy to be like, yeah,

202
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:08,410
I'm just going to drink less. Just
cut. I'm just going to drink less.

203
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,250
Like it's pretty rare that that's
going to, yeah, it's going to,

204
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,920
it's going to work. That's where I cut
back. I said don't cut back to stop. Yeah.

205
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,180
Jack,
next question.

206
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Communication is often used as
an excuse both under and over.

207
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,030
Oh, under communication and
over communication for why
the direction isn't clear.

208
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,790
Any suggestions on balancing comms,

209
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,570
communication up and down with
the right level of detail?

210
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,670
Here's a jacked up answer.

211
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,640
The answer to this question of
how to balance comms is comps.

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,520
You want to balance communications.
You have to communicate.

213
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:46,510
You have to understand,
hey,

214
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:48,850
do you guys know what's going on and you
need to check and make sure that they

215
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:52,810
know what's going on. If they know what's
going on, great. If they don't know,

216
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,580
then you didn't communicate
with them enough.

217
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,940
If you spend too much time communicating
and and now they're looking at you with

218
00:12:57,941 --> 00:12:59,590
a blank stare like, hey bro, we got this.

219
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,440
Then you communicated too
much so and ask them, Hey,

220
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,170
do you understand what's
going on? Cool. And if not,

221
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,350
do you understand why we're doing what
we're doing? Cool. All right, good.

222
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,520
I'm going to let you go do it now.

223
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,820
So the answer to making sure you're not
communicating either too much or too

224
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:19,480
little is communication. I hate to
say that, but that's what it is.

225
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,440
There can be some of that can be
nonverbal communication. You know,

226
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:24,940
you can observe if you,

227
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,210
if you give your guys a task and then
you go out and observe them and you see

228
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,320
that they can execute it really well,

229
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:32,650
then you'd know that you've done a
good job communicating it to them.

230
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,140
If you go out to observe them and they
don't know what they're doing and they

231
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:36,010
don't know what's going on,

232
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,970
then you realize how I didn't
give them enough information.

233
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,010
I need to communicate more.
So you don't have to necessarily ask them.

234
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:46,060
You can tell through observation and
checking on them and seeing where they're

235
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:49,630
at and what they're doing,
if they actually understand
what's going on. So yeah,

236
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,290
that's, that's it. Pretty straightforward.
Get you a little feedback loop going.

237
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,570
Yeah, that, but it is kind of like, and
I'm going to use the word again, dance.

238
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,950
It is kind of like a dance. It's
a dichotomy. Yes you can. Yes,

239
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:05,710
you can communicate too much and you can
communicate too little and you have to

240
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,320
find the balance thing because
if you communicate too much,

241
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:11,620
people stop listening to you and then
it's no longer communication at that point

242
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,110
because it's kind of like if you're
sleeping and I'm like, Hey, okay,

243
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,840
Jocko telling you what to do.
Like you can't hear me.

244
00:14:16,841 --> 00:14:21,400
It's not going into your brain. It kind
of has to go in. Your brain kind of does.

245
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,280
You got to catch what I'm throwing then,
you know,

246
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:27,040
and vice versa if we're quote
unquote communicating. So yeah,

247
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:31,420
you to put quotes around the
word. Well, there you go.

248
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,090
But if, if, if one of those,

249
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:36,280
even one of those things isn't
happening and we're technically,

250
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:40,190
we're not communicating. So like the
whole over thing that's like, yeah,

251
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:43,540
someone talking too much and the
other guy stops listening or you over

252
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,010
communicate so far in the spot.

253
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,250
I'm just saying like how you say
like feedback, you know like that

254
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,550
that's an important thing because
if you're like blah blah blah blah.

255
00:14:55,551 --> 00:15:00,050
And how you say the blank
stare communications con
communications not going on

256
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,380
anymore. Yeah, like the one that, I
don't know. You're giving me feedback,

257
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,960
which is good. See what I'm
saying? So now I'm clear.

258
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,540
I'm clear that you want me to move
it along. See what I'm saying?

259
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,130
It's good communication on your part.

260
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,330
Here's the thing with you and
your blank stare in my experience,

261
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,440
which I have a lot,
by the way,

262
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,420
your blank stare communicates way
more than just like a blank stare

263
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,490
for real. Mike Cirelli would, will
tell you all about that. Like you'll,

264
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:29,770
you'll have a whole conversation with
me and not even say one single word for

265
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,180
real.
I know exactly what you're saying.

266
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,600
See like right now I know exactly what
you're saying. Anyway, next question.

267
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,860
That's exactly what I was
saying. Actually. Like I said,

268
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,300
when taking ownership,

269
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:46,301
how can you prevent your boss thinking
you're a complete screw up and stop it

270
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:48,520
from escalating to a point where there,

271
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,270
where he starts blaming you for
things you're not actually at fault.

272
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,940
So this is one of those catch 22
situations where you actually don't think

273
00:15:57,941 --> 00:16:01,330
you're at fault. So when you
actually don't think you're at fault,

274
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,420
then you're thinking, oh,
I'm just taking ownership.

275
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,300
So that that's like the cool thing to do.

276
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,760
And that's what I'm trying to use this as
to make, to improve my situation. Right?

277
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,540
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna quote unquote take ownership.

278
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,790
And when you quote on quote,
take ownership,

279
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,670
but you actually don't believe
you're at fault, then you're not,

280
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,980
you're not really taking ownership.
So when you look around at your mission,

281
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,270
at your tasks, like what you're
being told to do and you say, Oh,

282
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,830
I've got to do this thing.

283
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:31,270
Oh it didn't go right and I'm going to
take ownership of it and get it fixed.

284
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,910
If you're just saying that and
you don't actually mean it,

285
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,990
then your boss starts blaming you for it.
Well if you,

286
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,020
you should feel that way. Cause when
your boss blames you for something,

287
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:43,510
you know what you should be saying.
Yeah boss,

288
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,170
I know I said that this was
my responsibility and this
is what I'm going to do

289
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:49,990
to fix it. You shouldn't, when your
boss starts blaming for you for things,

290
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,770
you shouldn't say, well no actually
that's not my area of responsibilities.

291
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,280
What you should say is, Oh
yes boss, like I just said,

292
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,760
this is my fault and here's what I'm
gonna do to fix it. That's what you do.

293
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,530
So you actually think
about this when you're,

294
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,800
when you're the type of person
that takes ownership of things,

295
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,460
you actually can't get blamed for things.

296
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,880
You can't blame me for things cause I'm
already volunteering and saying that

297
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:22,630
this was my responsibility. I'm going
to fix it. So that's what you do.

298
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,580
That's what you do. You take ownership
and you take real ownership at,

299
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,420
which means when there's a problem,
you look at it and say, this is, hey,

300
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,340
this is my fault and here's
what I'm going to do to fix it.

301
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,470
And when your boss says, Hey,
yeah, this is your fault, you go,

302
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,650
I know boss, I know 100% and this
is what I'm gonna do to fix it,

303
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,280
then you go fix it. Yeah. And
the thing that I didn't notice,

304
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,230
I said this before too, but I think
it's easy to sort of forget when,

305
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,880
especially if you're thinking like
this, which is, which I dig it, man,

306
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,850
is the whole, what am I going to
do to fix it? Because when you,

307
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,590
when you like for Real, uh, take
ownership of whatever, it's because man,

308
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:01,230
just like I said, it's almost like
what you just said, where, where you,

309
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,650
where you say you can't blame me,
blame me,

310
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,410
because I already took her
responsibility kind of thing because,

311
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,010
and in a big way,
it's not necessarily about blame,

312
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:14,850
it's more about fixing problems that are
still on a come up. Nothing's perfect,

313
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:18,360
you know? So now it's like, it's more of
like a, a way of dealing with problems.

314
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,080
Lesson, a whole blaming,
taking blame thing in culture,

315
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,940
in business, in real life will blame
each other. That's what happens.

316
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,410
And if you're the person that
says, Hey, you know what?

317
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:31,140
This is actually my fault and this
is what I'm going to do to fix it.

318
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,350
There you go. Yeah. Then that blame you
could say, yeah, blame me. I'm just,

319
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,690
I'm the guy because that's not the guy
made this mistake. No factor. Yeah. Yeah.

320
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:42,530
And then you can just focus on
fixing the problem and Yemen,

321
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,410
and that's the thing is the reason I bring
it up is because it is easy to forget

322
00:18:46,411 --> 00:18:50,730
that part because that blame is still
the problem part with extreme ownership.

323
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,690
I mean, up here obviously, because it's
like, hey, I took him extreme ownership.

324
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:58,620
Like, why are you saying
it's my fault? Yeah. Yeah.

325
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,200
It's a good or bad.
That's not the main part.

326
00:19:01,201 --> 00:19:06,060
The main part is like you got to fix
it. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, I think so.

327
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,590
All right. Next, next question.

328
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,740
I have to warrior kid daughters who were
very much on the path with pretty much

329
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:16,300
everything, but snacking, they're sick,

330
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:19,200
they're starting to put
some weight on as a result,

331
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,770
despite tons of physical activity
and good eating at mealtime.

332
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,810
How can I coach them in this area
without being overbearing? I would say,

333
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:32,250
I don't have snack food in your house.
That's junk, which you probably do don't.

334
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:34,950
And yeah, that's, that's real simple.

335
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,230
Where are they going to do if
there's no snack food in house?

336
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,920
Are they going to snack? Yeah. The
answer is they're not because there's,

337
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,090
they can go out and eat grass
yard if they're still hungry.

338
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,800
But, uh, so that's, that's one thing. The
other thing is you gotta be careful with,

339
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,460
with kids,
and I'll say this with girls especially,

340
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,250
you start throwing that like, hey,
you need to watch your weight.

341
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,660
You can really mess with their body image.

342
00:19:57,661 --> 00:20:00,770
So you gotta be really careful about
what you're doing with a kid with a,

343
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:04,530
with a little girl, cast what
little girls, little boys guest,

344
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:05,910
what they are when they're,
when they're little.

345
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,340
The little pudgy little creatures,
you know,

346
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,370
and I'm sure there'll be
some genetic kids that are,

347
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:16,371
have 2% body fat and a 12 pack of
abs when they're six years old in.

348
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:21,000
But most kids are like little,
little bit pudgy. That's part of,

349
00:20:21,001 --> 00:20:24,660
they're prepping for their growth spurt.
And if you're all freaked out about it,

350
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,910
um, you know, just you,

351
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,470
what you're gonna do is you're
gonna put that in their head,

352
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:31,170
they're gonna start looking in the mirror
and you don't want to do that to your

353
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:35,880
kids. So don't have any junk food
snacks in the house. Give him some milk.

354
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:36,301
Right?

355
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,970
Give him some more your kid milk cause
it tastes delicious and it is like a

356
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:42,210
snack and it's good for them.
And it'll be, it'll be satiating.

357
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:44,450
I know you don't like that Word Echo,
but it will satiate them.

358
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,250
It'll make them feel full. So
that's, that's a kind of snack

359
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,450
food to have in the house.

360
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,210
And if you're going to have other
snack food than make it beef Jerky,

361
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,010
make it some healthy, you know, some
carrots, some som celery, you know,

362
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,400
make it some good healthy
stuff. But um, yeah,

363
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,660
like worrying about your kids starting
to put on some weight when they're,

364
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,360
I don't know how old they are in this
particular case, but just be careful.

365
00:21:07,361 --> 00:21:10,420
You don't want to, you don't want to
freak your kids out and get them with a,

366
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:13,120
with a really paranoid body image.
Especially girls,

367
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:17,860
they're getting it from a
million different directions
and you gotta be careful

368
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,800
with it because that's a real,
that can be turned into a real problem.

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
And the thing that actually I,

370
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,500
you clarified really good to me one day
where when you kind of implement change,

371
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,230
you know, in a routine, especially if
snacking is kind of like a routine audit,

372
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,980
when you implement change, like it's,
there's going to be some hiccups there.

373
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,280
You know, like whether it be, I don't
know in this case like complaining like,

374
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:42,460
hey well you know, you're, you're saying
hey, don't keep snacks in the house.

375
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,690
So now there's no chocolate covered
pretzels anymore. You know like hey,

376
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:48,130
I remember the chocolate covered pretzels,

377
00:21:48,131 --> 00:21:50,460
they were right there in the little
pantry right there. Now they're gone.

378
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,630
Like what up? I haven't seen him
in dates. Yeah. You're like, hey,

379
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:55,780
we're not doing the chocolate
covered pretzels anymore or whatever.

380
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,960
There's going to be some blow back there.
Especially from the little kids,

381
00:21:58,961 --> 00:22:01,300
you know, they can be, look what dad and
you know, there might be some complaining.

382
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:06,190
So I think if we go in or when
we go in knowing those things,

383
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:08,710
that helps a lot. So you're kind
of prepared for it, you know,

384
00:22:08,711 --> 00:22:11,710
you can kind of plan what you're
going to say. Are you going to have,

385
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,000
you're getting way too intense with this,

386
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:15,130
but there's no chocolate covered pretzels.
Guess what?

387
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,080
They didn't have him at the store. I'm not
getting them. They're bad for us. Yeah,

388
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,800
I'd eaten a dig it. But a lot of
times when you have, you know,

389
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:25,150
two girls or whoever,
he's good get a bar. Yeah.

390
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,850
But they're not just your kids
that I pull up bar train. Yeah.

391
00:22:27,851 --> 00:22:30,700
But they're not going to be like, Hey,
oh whoa, no chocolate pretzels. Oh,

392
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:33,790
I'll just do pullups. It doesn't work like
that with the little kids. You got it.

393
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,130
Not that big of a deal to take, to pull
a snack out of your house. I don't think.

394
00:22:37,131 --> 00:22:39,700
Especially if you get some beef jerky
and you're like, ah, you know what,

395
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:41,530
that's us bad for us and I
don't want to eat any more.

396
00:22:41,531 --> 00:22:44,890
So I got some beef jerky here. It's really
good. Taste it. Yes. But to get seaweed,

397
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:49,360
dried seaweed used to eat that stuff.
Like it was like they were damn octopuses.

398
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,620
But that's good though, right by. Yes.

399
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:54,690
I liked the dry seaweed.
Yeah,

400
00:22:54,691 --> 00:22:56,980
it sells pounding some of that the
other day with both of my kids,

401
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,410
they're like salty delicious.
Anyway,

402
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,710
what I'm saying is I'm not saying
necessarily make it a huge deal.

403
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm just saying if you're ready
for the blow back, you know,

404
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,830
cause what if you're not ready?
You think that, okay, I'll,

405
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll agree with you just to do,

406
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:12,370
we can move this conversation along in
order to prep for huge stop the chocolate

407
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:16,390
covered in your compound, you don't really
agree with, you can come up with a, uh,

408
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,020
a plan of action, little uphill, a plan
of action and immediate action drill.

409
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,760
When that six year old goes, dad, where
are the chocolate covered pretzels?

410
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,940
You have a very well rehearsed response.

411
00:23:27,941 --> 00:23:30,460
You can do some role playing
with your wife and you can go,

412
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,780
yeah, see I see what you're doing.
Then you're cool man. I'm telling you,

413
00:23:37,781 --> 00:23:41,430
this helps.
This will help because you know the,

414
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,980
the poor kids you care, you know, you
care about the short term a little bit,

415
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,040
you know,

416
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,410
of course the long term,
you know that's what you're doing.

417
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,150
The whole thing are you going to do
is explain, hey, you know what, hey,

418
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:53,640
we're not doing that anymore because it's
not good for us. Oh, okay. Straight up.

419
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,680
Cool. There it is. That's
not a huge well, well

420
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,290
anyway, roleplay with
your wife. Next question,

421
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,130
why isn't MMA or did you do to a bigger
component of law enforcement training?

422
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,780
It seems to be a huge missed opportunity.
Yeah,

423
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,250
it certainly is a huge missed opportunity.
I,

424
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,900
I plead with all law enforcement
personnel to train Brazilian Jujitsu,

425
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,450
MMA, wrestling, boxing, Moy,

426
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:30,451
Tai as much as you possibly can and I
plead with law enforcement agencies of all

427
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:37,061
types that I talk to to get these types
of programs in your departments because

428
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,270
there is no doubt that it will help you,

429
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,790
help your officers be better and more
prepared to handle situations on the

430
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:47,030
street.

431
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,020
Just had a police officer coming here the
other day that was just signing up and

432
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:51,921
you know,

433
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:55,820
she just got done to the police academy
and I'm so thankful that she's here

434
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,550
because I'm like,
yes,

435
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,640
go and start training immediately and
it will be so beneficial for you in your

436
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,230
career,
in your life.

437
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,500
And one thing about all these things and
any form of martial arts for like self

438
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:14,990
defense or self defense
situations or you know,

439
00:25:14,991 --> 00:25:17,680
because that's sometimes when it turns
into a for a police officer there,

440
00:25:17,681 --> 00:25:18,670
there are no longer,
you know,

441
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,240
once you things things crossover from
where they're on offense to where they're

442
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:26,300
on defense. And for a police
officer, this is a great example,

443
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:31,301
like this was a female and hey could a
female hundred and 18 pound female police

444
00:25:34,341 --> 00:25:38,780
officer take a guy that was drunk,

445
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,160
slightly drunk,
a wrestler who's 240 pounds?

446
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,260
The answer is no, she's not going
to fare well in that situation.

447
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:52,580
But if she knows if whatever she knows,

448
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,960
if she knows if she's trained,

449
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,440
she might be able to prolong that conflict
long enough for her backup to arrive.

450
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,440
She might be able to stay alive, keep
control of her gun or whatever, you know,

451
00:26:03,441 --> 00:26:08,180
keep control of the situation
long enough that she,

452
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:11,570
that she will get her back up there.
So that right there,

453
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:15,560
that's the same thing I tell uh, females
that want self defense. It's like,

454
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,483
hey look,

455
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,600
I'm not saying you can't cause you look
at some of our female Jujitsu players,

456
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,810
they will choke out a
dude deflect straight up.

457
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,030
They will arm walk them like for
real and a 200 pound wrestler,

458
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,200
they'll put a guillotine on them and choke
them, put them asleep. So that's that.

459
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:33,770
That can happen.

460
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,430
That's what someone that's really skilled
to make up for their lack of strength

461
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,740
and lack of size being a female.

462
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,720
But what if even if you're not
that good but you can postpone,

463
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:48,300
you can prolong someones trying to
grab you and take you somewhere.

464
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:51,930
Someone's trying to do something
to you. You can prolong it. If the,

465
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:55,500
the longer you can delay the, the, uh,

466
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,970
or offense from taking place,

467
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,240
the better chance you have of somebody
else coming along or somebody noticing or

468
00:27:00,241 --> 00:27:04,160
that person just giving up because
most, most criminals are, you know,

469
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,140
weak minded and they don't want that
kind of resistance. So yes, totally. Um,

470
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:14,250
you're asking why isn't it, there's a
bunch of reason or reasons why it isn't.

471
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,240
And one of them, and I've talked
about this before, but there was,

472
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,360
there's been cases where people
that were not trained enough,

473
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,150
they were trained enough to be dangerous,
where they've choked guys to death.

474
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,120
And that has happened.
You crush someone's wind pipe,

475
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:33,850
you can be screwing around and, or
you just not screwing around, but you,

476
00:27:33,851 --> 00:27:36,120
you can be, you can be screwing around.
You could, you know, you and I could,

477
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,290
could start wrestling around.

478
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,100
If you and I were white belts and
we started going out it really hard,

479
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:43,820
there's a chance one of us could
get the other one in a choke hold,

480
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,710
had a couple drinks in us. And
next thing you know, um, um,

481
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,880
I put you to sleep, which is, Oh
yeah, I'm going to put you sleep.

482
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,850
Cause sometimes you choke
your friend. You're like, I'm
going to put you to sleep.

483
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,051
Well,

484
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:59,070
if I'm drunk and you're drunk and I put
you to sleep and I don't really know

485
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,830
that you're asleep yet and I'm
squeezing an extra hard cause I'm drunk.

486
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,551
Next thing you know,

487
00:28:02,551 --> 00:28:05,700
I look up and all of a sudden your
hyoid bone is crushed your windpipe and

488
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:09,810
you're not going to die.
So that's happened in law enforcement.

489
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,950
They've banned chokes, which is a
horrible thing because choking is, uh,

490
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,490
is one of the best and most minimal forces
to use to subdue someone is to choke

491
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:24,750
them. Even an arm lock is
going to break their arm.

492
00:28:24,751 --> 00:28:26,610
It's going to ruin their tendons.
It's going to hurt him.

493
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,800
A choke doesn't even hurt someone. It just
puts him to sleep just capacities. So,

494
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,770
but that's one of the reasons
why they don't teach it as much.

495
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,420
The other reason is they don't give enough
training to law enforcement officers

496
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,960
and they need to, uh, they train. Uh,

497
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:48,170
an absolutely pathetic amount of time
in what they call defensive tactics.

498
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,300
Generally the police officers',
call it defensive tactics,

499
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:56,510
which is them fighting and maintaining
weapon retention and all that they train

500
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,480
of,
of very small number of hours a year.

501
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,380
They measure the time that they
train in, in, in a year, in hours.

502
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,530
That's how little they train. So my, my,

503
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,070
my campaign I'd like to go forward with
is I think that police officers who

504
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:17,910
spend one fifth of their
active duty time training,

505
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,270
one fifth of their time should be
training. That's the way it should work.

506
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,680
And I don't know how I'm going to
start that ground wave, but there's,

507
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,740
that's such a solid idea that
no one can argue against it.

508
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,530
There's not one single argument against
every police officer spending one fifth

509
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:41,040
of their time training. And, and if
you want to argue with me about that,

510
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,100
and the argument is,

511
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,920
well, we won't have enough police
officers out on the beat then.

512
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,290
And here's the question back at that,

513
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,250
would you rather have
eight highly qualified,

514
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:55,930
highly trained officers out on the beat
or 10 officers that were barely trained

515
00:29:55,931 --> 00:30:00,880
at all? And the answer is so easy to that
question. So that's a a bunch of things.

516
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,430
I'll continue to push
that as much as I can.

517
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,840
And I know a ton of law enforcement
people listen to this and just, you know,

518
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:10,090
I think that's a great idea to
start pushing from the ground,

519
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,780
from the grass roots.
We want to one fifth of our time training,

520
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,060
it's gonna make us all better.
It's going to prevent,

521
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:20,500
think of all the time that's all hours
that are wasted in legal actions after

522
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:23,290
there is a bad shooting or an
injury or something like that.

523
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,000
Think of all the stuff
that gets wasted there.

524
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,330
Take the officer's and train
them properly. That's what,

525
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:30,430
that's what needs to happen.
So hopefully it will.

526
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,760
And then what would you suggest that,

527
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:38,470
I mean kind of obvious what you can
say, but he's like, just like, you know,

528
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,640
police officers going and getting
training on their own. So like, you know,

529
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,710
if you have to go get
training on your own,

530
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,750
go get training on your own
because most of you did,

531
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:51,160
some places they'll have
a law enforcement. Yeah.
Some kind of deal. Yeah.

532
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:53,870
Actually this Guy Craig,
right. And now me the

533
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,790
police officer up in Oregon,
if I'm not mistaken,

534
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,170
always doing Jujitsu with his
uniform on and you can look,

535
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,340
look him up on Instagram. You can see
all the stuff he does with Jujitsu.

536
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:09,400
Any applies that to law enforcement and,
and it like men,

537
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:13,690
it's such a clear demonstration of the
benefits and in, in, you know, whatever,

538
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,270
everyone who trains like,
you know, it's like man,

539
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:18,100
it becomes really after
you trained for a while,

540
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:22,030
all this dealing with other people
in chaotic situations. But it's easy.

541
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:25,330
It's literally easy. So man, yeah. Get,

542
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,390
watch Craig in his stuff. And,
and here's the thing though,

543
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:31,240
I don't know how that works with
like work and you know, hey,

544
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:36,110
you're at risk of injury. I
Dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno what
the whole deal is. But man,

545
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,050
the way I say it meant trends or Craig's
over there training all the time and so

546
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:42,370
yeah,

547
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,370
just train on your own until you're
situation arises with the law enforcement.

548
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:53,050
Yeah, well hopefully they will implement
that sometime in the future. Man.

549
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,600
Next question.
Bow or not in g a okay.

550
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:01,990
And Jujitsu. He's three months
in professor, not bowing.

551
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,200
I don't other practitioners bow.

552
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,240
No one told me when enrolling
versus I'm not in a herd.

553
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:12,580
Respect to professor
mats and practitioners.

554
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,260
This pretty simple question. Some
people bow when they all go on the mat,

555
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:20,470
some people bow to the professor,
some people don't. I don't.

556
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:23,230
I just kind of do whatever and
it doesn't really matter to me.

557
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,910
And there's a little bit of paranoia
in the question, which I understand,

558
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:31,870
which is like, hey, hey, when in Rome
do as Romans do, but at the same time,

559
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:34,070
you know, I'm going to hold the
line kind of on my personal value.

560
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:37,810
So it's like I don't, I'm not bowing.
Right. That's not my gig or I,

561
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:39,980
it's respect you got a,
like there's

562
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,090
both those extremes and both of them
can be articulated in a way that's fine.

563
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,810
And to me, I'm just like, whatever. Oh
everyone. It looks like everyone's bound.

564
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:51,230
Call him about not, not that big of a
deal. I don't, I don't freak out about it.

565
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,280
It's not that big of a deal.
I think it, to me, to me,

566
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,180
the overall arching
principle of my actions,

567
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:04,070
bowing or not bowing is more based on
my overall principle of not making a

568
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:06,110
spectacle out of myself
one way or the other.

569
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:11,480
Like I'm not here to like draw
attention and be like, hey, I don't bow.

570
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,290
Or Hey, this is Jujitsu. You need to
respect the that I'm like over here.

571
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:19,460
Just trying to train. Yeah. Not trying
to make a big deal out of myself.

572
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:23,660
So if everyone's bound, it's like, cool,
look, they know no big deal. I get it.

573
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,080
Or if no one's bowing and it's
like, Eh, no big deal. Yeah.

574
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,030
I guess people might be disappointed
if I don't have some hard stance.

575
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:36,590
Right? Yeah. But I don't, yeah, there's,
there's some things I don't worry about.

576
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,220
That's one of them. Yes. I believe
that. How about we just trade? Yeah,

577
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,540
agree and other that'll sort itself out
anyway because if you're at a school,

578
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,450
because some schools sorta required,
that's the protocol here at this school.

579
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,400
No big deal. You can have that
exact attitude be like, cool,

580
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,690
that's what we're doing.
That's what it could cause.

581
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:52,310
Some people you bought on the Mat,

582
00:33:52,311 --> 00:33:55,280
you bought off the mat at the
beginning of class to the, you know,

583
00:33:55,281 --> 00:33:59,390
to the picture of whatever at the end,
like the whole deal. But same deal.

584
00:33:59,391 --> 00:34:02,350
It's like balance, not hard to
do. It doesn't like, you know,

585
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:06,080
affect your family life at home or
nothing like that. It's just, just bough.

586
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:10,090
Same thing with not bowing doesn't affect
your, yeah. It's not hard to know now.

587
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,510
I guess there's a line in
either direction right there.

588
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,690
You know where you could, you know,
you could be telling me like, okay,

589
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:22,160
when we bough, you need to bow
and you need to praise, praise,

590
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,380
praise instructor, whoever. It's
like, hmm, okay. Probably not.

591
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:29,300
I'm probably not going to do that.
You know, like we're, we're not,

592
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,210
we're not worshiping, right.
We're not bowing. It's like, okay,

593
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,590
little sign of respect. Cool. I got
that, but we're not going to turn uh, uh,

594
00:34:36,591 --> 00:34:40,010
respect into a worship. There's a
line that that will not be crossed.

595
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,580
The other direction is like, oh, you know,

596
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,750
someone's teaching a class and
I'm just going to walk, you know,

597
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,630
run my mouth and walk onto the
mat. Like it's no big deal. No.

598
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:49,670
Like you're going to be respectful
to the instructor of course.

599
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:52,400
So I'm just going to find out a little
balance there and balanced those two

600
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:53,120
dichotomies.

601
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,120
So what if you go as a guest or
whatever and another place in their,

602
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,620
their protocol is in European,
like sorted,

603
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,040
crossed over to worship.
I have you going to,

604
00:35:06,041 --> 00:35:09,050
I haven't really been to an
academy crossed over into worship.

605
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,440
Let's say it did just a little bit
or like would you go as a guest,

606
00:35:12,441 --> 00:35:14,690
do you just go through the
motions at a respect for?

607
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,260
What I would probably do is go through
the motions but then do other actions

608
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:26,870
that would indicate to everyone that I
have a free mind and that I'm not down

609
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,080
with what they just did type of scenario.
Like I wouldn't be obnoxious about it,

610
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,280
but I'd be like,

611
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:34,550
Oh you know what I'm gonna do is take
off my g and sit on the mat right now.

612
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:39,780
Like oh that's not allowed.
Okay. Sorry. Cool. Oh my back.
Oh yeah, yeah, no big deal.

613
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,670
They put it on like, all
right, cool. Whatever.

614
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:46,140
It just kind of like indicate would you
say at my academy like we don't care

615
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:48,750
about these small pink.
Yeah. Maybe like, um,

616
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:52,180
I dunno if I do that cause
then you're just trying to do,

617
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,870
trying to again make a spectacle.
I'm not trying to make a spectacle man.

618
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,750
I'm just trying to, I'm just trying
to, just trying to be, you know,

619
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,210
just trying to get some training
in men to be honest with you.

620
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,970
So don't make a spectacle and get in the
way and let that Spec to go get in the

621
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:08,370
way of your training. Yeah. How
often are we making, I mean,

622
00:36:08,371 --> 00:36:12,390
how often do people try and make
spectacles out of themselves?

623
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:17,100
It's like people do that and that's
not cool. Like don't do that.

624
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,850
Don't be a spectacle. Just be, you know,

625
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,250
I told a story before about the,
the,

626
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:27,120
when I went to University of San Diego
and there was a professor there that was

627
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,950
like push, she was an American,
but she was a Buddhist monk.

628
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:36,870
Right. You know, so she had it at
some point converted to Buddhism and,

629
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,530
and she would shave her head and walk
around in the robes and stuff like that.

630
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,350
And I was like, we don't, one
of the tenants of, you know,

631
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,380
being Buddhist is to like not
make a spectacle of yourself.

632
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,540
And yet here you are walking around
a Western campus in, uh, you know,

633
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:54,150
in a, in a uniform with a
shaved head. That's not,

634
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,140
that's not that you are making a
spectacle of yourself. So I was just like,

635
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:58,920
I would,

636
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,920
I would think it would be more like the
Buddha to just wear a pair of jeans and

637
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:09,750
a tee shirt and just have like,
whatever normal. Just be normal.

638
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,510
Just look as normal as
possible. Yeah, there's a whole,

639
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,420
like there's a whole thing that's
sort of my, that's sort of,

640
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:18,480
I fall into a live fall back
on that, you know, like a lot.

641
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,380
So you'd think that she might argue world,

642
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,410
this is how us Buddhists like minimalize
our whole efforts to have heavy duality

643
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:31,770
or whatever.
But at the end of the day,

644
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:37,110
you are when you're in Thailand, which
is awesome. Like the Buddhist monks,

645
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:40,070
if they're everywhere and they're
there, that's what they do, you know?

646
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:40,820
And so they're,

647
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,070
they're not making a spectacle
of themselves at all and
they come around and get

648
00:37:44,071 --> 00:37:46,650
rice in the morning. It's very
cool. It's a very cool culture.

649
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,390
But if you're in a culture of a
southern California University,

650
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,080
there's no other Buddhist monks that
are walking around. So you're kind of,

651
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,550
and it may, maybe I'm wrong, you know,
I, I'm not trying to disparage, you know,

652
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:02,820
this individual, I'm just saying
from my perspective, I was like, hmm,

653
00:38:02,821 --> 00:38:04,410
if you really want to have the,

654
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,770
the low profile and not bring
attention to yourself and give up,

655
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,870
you know,
give up the trappings of ego,

656
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,500
right.
You want to give up the trappings of ego,

657
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,880
then you don't want people to notice you.
If you don't want people to notice you,

658
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,130
you dress like a gray man. You just sucks.
I kind of normal, you know, forgettable.

659
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,400
Yeah.
So anyways,

660
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,310
I'm trying to get like deep into
the religious aspect of a Jujitsu

661
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:41,050
and robes.
Sure.

662
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,890
But that's just kinda my opinion.
I dig it. All right. Next question.

663
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,920
Did you ever have a CCT?

664
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,230
Did you ever have us CCT attached
to your unit? And if yes,

665
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,470
how was having them alongside and
what advantages did they bring to the

666
00:38:59,471 --> 00:38:59,981
battlefield?

667
00:38:59,981 --> 00:39:04,480
So CCT is an air force combat controller
and they're special operations guys.

668
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,350
They're awesome guys.

669
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:09,250
They go through really hardcore
training and I didn't really,

670
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,380
I worked with him occasionally,

671
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,090
not very directly on a couple occasions.
They were great guys,

672
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,880
but I never worked with them enough to,

673
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,820
to be talking about him all the time
cause I just didn't have that experience.

674
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:22,031
You know,

675
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,410
I don't talk about a bull riders
either cause I don't know many of them,

676
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,920
you know, so it's just, it's just
that, uh, but they're great guys.

677
00:39:29,921 --> 00:39:33,350
I know they have an awesome reputation
and my friends have worked with them, uh,

678
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,950
loved working with them.
If there was a guy that was,

679
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,910
I've had a couple of guys a
kind of heard names of, so for,

680
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,380
as far as coming on the
podcast, yeah, of course.

681
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:44,680
I never formed on the podcast have
a without question. No problem.

682
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,860
And what we did,
what we had was we had Anglico,

683
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:49,330
which was Dave Burke and his guys.

684
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,590
They were the guys that were doing the
CCT type mission for us when we were in

685
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:55,310
Ramadi. So, uh,

686
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,480
that's one of the reasons why we
didn't work with them very much on that

687
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,300
deployment.
The previous deployment we had my,

688
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:04,660
I had my own jet attack and that's
what we work with. So just, just, uh,

689
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,320
just didn't have that opportunity.
So they're awesome guys though.

690
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,380
Next question.
Jocko.

691
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:16,410
Currently in a busy and stressed place
in life and keep looking back at what

692
00:40:16,511 --> 00:40:17,344
could have been,

693
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:22,390
how do you bounce back to doing you
and not getting in your own head?

694
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,320
I appreciate what you and
I could do. Thank you both.
And God bless. All right. Uh,

695
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,010
you know,

696
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:30,280
we can look back all day long at what
could have been and it doesn't matter.

697
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,220
Well, the only thing that matters from
the past is what you learned from it.

698
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,510
So let's learn from it and look at
the future. And one thing I'll say is,

699
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,930
oh, well it's like this saying about
when's a good time to plant a tree?

700
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,190
Do you know when the best time
to plant a tree is right now?

701
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,980
Either 22 years ago or
right now, right? Like,

702
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,770
look, you didn't do it then. So we'd
guess what you can do. You do it now.

703
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,270
When's the best time to start a
savings account? Same deal. Yeah.

704
00:41:00,271 --> 00:41:03,400
It's the same thing like you know,
20 years ago or right now.

705
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,140
So w w w if you sit there and say,
oh well I could have done,

706
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,510
if I wish I would have done this
years ago, I wish it well guess what,

707
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:13,780
you look up at a year and you don't have
that little sapling now you could have

708
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:18,550
a little sapling, right? Nothing.
So it's not that big of a deal.

709
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,100
Dave, hey you, you, you went through life.
You made some, you wasted some time. Good.

710
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,320
You didn't waste it completely.
First of all, you learned from it.

711
00:41:26,321 --> 00:41:28,530
You've got to experience, you had
fun, you did other things you'd,

712
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,830
you learned about,

713
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:33,710
you learned about relationships because
some girl dumped you and you realize

714
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,710
that you can't over commit to a,
uh, to a liar. You know, he's like,

715
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:37,880
you've learned these things,
right?

716
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,020
So just because things were negative
experiences in the past and they didn't

717
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:42,920
feel good to go through,

718
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,460
it doesn't mean that they were all bad
cause you still took something away from

719
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:49,580
it and you learned from it.
So that's part one.

720
00:41:49,581 --> 00:41:52,730
Part two is what are you going to do?
Plant a tree today.

721
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:53,930
That's what you're going to do.

722
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,920
Plant a tree today and start to nourish
that tree and take the lessons that you

723
00:41:57,921 --> 00:42:01,550
learned to sprinkle on that tree and
feed that tree so we can grow fast.

724
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,340
That tree that you plant today should
be able to grow faster than the one you

725
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:07,520
would have planned it 20 years ago
because you have the knowledge on how to,

726
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,110
on how to nourish that tree and feed
that tree so it can grow quicker.

727
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,000
So just get on the path.
Don't,

728
00:42:14,001 --> 00:42:16,730
don't play around with what's going on
in the past. Learn from it, move on.

729
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:19,610
Human Nick goes along with how like little

730
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,050
beach, it wasn't a speech, a little
talk you had with me about, you know,

731
00:42:25,051 --> 00:42:29,340
you gotta play the long game or
whatever and kind of in this case,

732
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,060
same deal where it's kind
of more so than even play.

733
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,400
You are playing the long game but keep
the long game in mind cause that's what

734
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,050
you know, those thoughts
like Dang, I should've,

735
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:40,170
I should've went to college where I
should or shouldn't have to. I don't know,

736
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:42,540
whatever this whole what
could have been kind of deal.

737
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,910
That's like your mind saying like right
now, if I would have done that back then,

738
00:42:47,911 --> 00:42:51,450
right now I would have this and that's
the part that kind of message like jams

739
00:42:51,451 --> 00:42:53,880
you up mentally, right? Where you're like,
man, I could have had this right now.

740
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,890
So when you think so you don't,

741
00:42:55,891 --> 00:42:59,880
you still as a result typically
in my experience anyway,

742
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:05,520
which was almost done, but
typically I think like wait, I,

743
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:08,840
because when I think of what could have
been because of this thing that I kind

744
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:11,430
of want right now,
I don't want to seed right now.

745
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:14,640
I want what I could have Hatton.
That's what I want to have that.

746
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:18,360
So plant the seed. Yeah. So, but ma
look kind of emotionally or mentally,

747
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,420
that's not where your mind is. Your
mind isn't like, Hey, I can't have that.

748
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:22,330
I accept that as.

749
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:25,290
So let's think of the future now
that your mind doesn't do that.

750
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:29,070
It's more like hung up on on that,
right? But what you don't have right now,

751
00:43:29,071 --> 00:43:32,250
that empty void that you have,

752
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,000
you don't want to fill that void with a
seed. The seed doesn't do nothing for me.

753
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,250
The not even a sapling that doesn't
do anything. A full grown tree.

754
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:43,320
That's what I want right now.
That's what I could have had.

755
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:47,970
So how is a seed the problem
or the solution to my problem?

756
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,580
But if you're looking at the big picture,

757
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:54,950
the long game as you so
eloquently put it at day brother,

758
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,770
the seed is nothing but a
tree at a different time.
And that's really what it is.

759
00:43:58,771 --> 00:44:01,530
See what I'm saying?
So that is a bra that is a solution.

760
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,830
So what I'm saying and then

761
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,940
be the most philosophically a bold and
and unbounded statement you've made on

762
00:44:08,551 --> 00:44:13,530
this. The seed is nothing but a treat at
different times. I like how you did that.

763
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,660
Good job.
It's all been worth it.

764
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:22,650
The pain and suffering. Good
listening has finally paid off. Good.

765
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:27,360
Cool. Man. Thank you. Anyway, so yeah,

766
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:28,260
I think if like

767
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,010
can keep that long game in mind.
That's helped me

768
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,130
like a lot with just even like
small little things, you know stuff.

769
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,170
It's like uncomfortable.
I don't want to do this right now,

770
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,540
but you know this exact thought like,
man I am,

771
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,690
I'm looking forward to
the day that I'm not,

772
00:44:42,691 --> 00:44:45,600
I'm thinking the opposite of what could
have been. I'm thinking now I'm thinking.

773
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,860
Sure. I'm so glad I planted that
seed last year or whatever, you know,

774
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,390
so you can look at the long game and
kind of fulfill all that stuff. Anyway,

775
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,920
next question. Hi Jocko. Echo my
name spelt wrong by the way here,

776
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,650
but hydrochloride echo,
quick question. I really get,

777
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,960
I get really bad anxiety doing
almost everything. For example,

778
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,400
when talking to people,

779
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:12,750
I always feel like as if I'm going to
say something stupid and this makes me

780
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,260
start to stutter and lose my train
of thought and I just go blank.

781
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:22,020
I'd say on that one, uh, first of all,
you got to condition yourself. You know,

782
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:25,320
you've got to practice, you've got to
rehearse. I would actually, first of all,

783
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:29,100
I would say go get some speech therapy
if someone to help you out because that

784
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,870
will,
that will be beneficial to you.

785
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,470
Getting someone that's a professional
to come in and say like, okay,

786
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:39,180
here's the drills that we're going to
do. A my buddy that drums in my band, he,

787
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:44,130
there's drumming drills that you can
do so you can get your left hand to do

788
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:48,330
something different than your left foot
and your right hand to do something.

789
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:51,990
There's drills that you can do to
overcome because if you're like me,

790
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:52,860
you're not a drummer.

791
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,510
I my right hand and right foot are going
to do the same thing at the same time.

792
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,330
My left hand and my left foot are going
to do the same thing at the same time,

793
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:04,530
but there's drills that you can do to
overcome that and there's drills that you

794
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:08,130
can do with speech so you can practice
and you rehearse and you think about it.

795
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,960
Then you'll get better at it.

796
00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:14,070
And the cool thing is like once
you start to build some confidence,

797
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:17,610
then you get more and more confident
and you'll get better and better at.

798
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,300
The other thing I would say is talk
about things that you know, right?

799
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,640
Don't try and explain
things that you don't know.

800
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,480
Don't try and try and come up with some
theory that you don't understand and try

801
00:46:27,481 --> 00:46:30,750
and just roll it out off the tip of
your tongue because you don't know it.

802
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,850
So just when that's happening,

803
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:35,160
just sit back and kind of formulate
your thoughts and think, okay,

804
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,450
if all the things I'm thinking right now,

805
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,790
what do I actually kind of have a grip on?

806
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:42,480
Maybe it's a question sometimes
forming something in a question,

807
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,850
we'll make it easier for you to
state it because you're saying, hey,

808
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:49,110
I got a question and now
you're not putting pressure
on yourself to come up with

809
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:53,340
this perfect yarn of why that this
theory that you out instead of you post

810
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:53,941
something as a question,

811
00:46:53,941 --> 00:46:57,420
that'll take some pressure off you
and talk about things that you know.

812
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,291
And if you don't know it,

813
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:01,170
then ask a question about it and that'll
get you more comfortable and you keep

814
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:04,920
talking and keep trying and over time
you'll get better and better at it,

815
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,060
but yet you have to,

816
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:11,360
you have to not jump in like don't go
and volunteer to give the speech at the

817
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,140
local club. Right. No volunteer too.

818
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:20,460
When people are having a conversation
say, Hey, can I ask a question about this?

819
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,850
Start with that.
That's like the easiest entry point.

820
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:26,340
No one's expecting you to say anything.
Brilliant. When you ask a question,

821
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,860
they're just expecting you
to ask questions so it's
not that big of a deal and

822
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:34,380
then just build on that man. It's exposure
therapy, exposure therapy. That's okay.

823
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:37,083
Next question.

824
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:41,530
When you transitioned from e Oh,

825
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,950
how did your approach to working with
with men you previously served with as

826
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:51,430
enlisted now that you were an officer?

827
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,480
This is such an easy question because the
bottom line is when I transferred from

828
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:57,070
being an enlisted guy
to be being an officer,

829
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:59,770
I didn't change anything in the
way that I treated everyone.

830
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,360
I treated people the same.

831
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,160
And when I was a young enlisted guy or
a senior enlisted guy or more senior,

832
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:10,300
I was never like, I would, I only made
it to e five before I went off, sir.

833
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:14,260
But when I was in my third platoon with
other guys that were not in their third

834
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:18,010
platoon, I treat people like,
hey man, with, you know, hey,

835
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:20,530
this is what we're going to do. This is
how we're going to make it happen. Now,

836
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,310
I got to caveat that for the guys that
were in platoons with me when I was in

837
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:25,750
the e five mafia,
hey,

838
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,730
I was a little crazy with the hazing and
like does suck to be a new guy in one

839
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:35,140
of my opportunities and I get that.
But as you guys have told me,

840
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,350
you appreciate it. It once
you've got a little, you know,

841
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:42,550
once you saw the big picture, there
was appreciation, but no, from a,

842
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,180
from an actual working relationship,
hey, you know, what are you gonna do?

843
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,073
You gonna stay humble.

844
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,140
You're gonna treat people with respect
regardless of your above them or below

845
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:52,420
them in the chain of command.
Um,

846
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:57,450
there's this saying that I didn't talk
about when we had Derek Herrera on and

847
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,700
it's, it's pulled from that
speech by Jacqueline. Bye.
Gunnery Sergeant Jacqueline.

848
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,110
He says, at the end of the speech, he
says, I'm not above you, not below you,

849
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,950
always beside you. So think about
that from a leadership perspective,

850
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:17,020
not above you, not blow you always beside
you. So if you have that attitude, look,

851
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:20,740
I'm not a boat when I'm not
above you and I'm not below you,

852
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,700
like we're equals and we're trying to
figure out how to best solve this problem.

853
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:27,370
And if you treat people like that,

854
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:30,070
regardless if you're above them or
below them and the chain of command,

855
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,750
you'll treat him with respect
and humility, you'll be
fine. And that's what I did.

856
00:49:34,751 --> 00:49:36,700
I didn't treat anybody any
different. And I mean, I had,

857
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,000
I had guys that worked for,
that worked for me,

858
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,180
that had been my peers or
that I had worked for before.

859
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,660
When I, when I went through that
transition and it was like no factor.

860
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:53,230
It was literally no factor
because these guys were, you know,

861
00:49:53,231 --> 00:49:54,670
when we were friends,
we worked together.

862
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:57,340
We focused on getting the job done
when they were above me in the chain of

863
00:49:57,341 --> 00:49:58,001
command,
what did I do?

864
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,850
I worked hard and focused on getting the
job done when they were below me in the

865
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:03,700
chain of command. Oh No. It's
like, hey, they're working hard.

866
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:07,900
Did they become less of a person? Did
I become more of a person? No. No.

867
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:11,830
I put a different rank on my sleeve.
What does that mean? Nothing.

868
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,910
It doesn't mean it mean. It means,
what does it mean? It means that

869
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:21,430
I'm going to be given this brief instead
of some other guy. Cool. No big deal.

870
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:25,480
You know what? Why don't you give the
brief? I'm fine with that. Yeah. So yeah,

871
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,070
respect,
humility and

872
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,040
never above you, never below
you, always beside you.

873
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,380
It's a good little thing
to think about there again.

874
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,970
Did you ever have the situations where
you're throwing darts at the guys back at

875
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:42,920
the bar, you know, for your
hazing situation? No. No.
Sure. Yeah, we did some pretty,

876
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:46,850
we did some pretty rough hazing though.
Uh, for sure. You know, lots, lots of, uh,

877
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:49,250
yeah, it was, it was
not fun. It wasn't fun.

878
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,590
It wasn't fun and it was part
of the ritual back in the day.

879
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,240
It's not as much as any as it is, not
as much as that anymore, but you know,

880
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:02,660
guess what, guys are fighting a
war now. Yeah. So I'm not like, oh,

881
00:51:02,661 --> 00:51:05,030
they'll guys don't have it as
hard. Guess what the, when I got,

882
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,970
when I was in the team, so
when I first got to the teams,
it was like, oh, cool. Oh,

883
00:51:07,971 --> 00:51:10,340
you're in the teams. Yeah,
you're going to get hazed. Ooh.

884
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,800
Guess what these guys are, can get
nowadays they're going to get shot at,

885
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,570
they're going to get
hit with idds. So, uh,

886
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,680
not that big of a deal.

887
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,340
It's just a little bit of a culture
change and that's the way it is.

888
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:27,050
Next question. Dichotomy of
leadership has some great principles.

889
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,980
What is it appropriate
philosophy concerning time
to train versus manage out a

890
00:51:31,981 --> 00:51:36,870
direct report when they have
been in the role for over eight.

891
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,430
Yeah.

892
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:40,700
This changes from industry to industry
to spend depending on the situation that

893
00:51:40,701 --> 00:51:42,920
you're in and sometimes you don't have,

894
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,640
you have a really tight timeline to get
people up to speed and if they don't get

895
00:51:46,641 --> 00:51:47,670
up to speed,
you've got to get rid of him on.

896
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:50,150
Otherwise it's going to cost the team
or it's going to cost the company money.

897
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,640
So how long are you going to give them?

898
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,820
You're going to give them as much time
as you think you can give them before

899
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,080
they started to tracking from the team.

900
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,560
You're also gonna make sure that you're
not investing so much time in one person

901
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:02,150
to try and get them up to speed,

902
00:52:02,151 --> 00:52:04,610
that you're ignoring everyone else and
now it's having a negative impact on the

903
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:06,320
team. So you just got to
look at the timing. Again,

904
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:10,070
I worked with construction companies where
if they don't get a job done on time,

905
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,340
it'll cost them $60,000 a day.

906
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,220
They don't play around like they need
someone that's going to be able to get the

907
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:16,970
job done.

908
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,900
You'll get some sales organization that's
commission only and there's somebody

909
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:22,550
that's taken a while to get up to speed.
They don't really care.

910
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:23,780
It's not costing the company anything.

911
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:28,250
So you've got to figure out in your
industry how much time that looks like and

912
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:32,210
then you got to set the
expectations clearly. And once
you've done that, you say,

913
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:35,120
okay, listen bud, I've been working
with for this amount of time.

914
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,300
Here's where I want you to be at
this date. If you don't get there,

915
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,050
we're going to move you out. Math, it's
the way it is pretty straight forward.

916
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,650
Okay.
Next question.

917
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,940
I have to coexist at times with an
individual who knows I'm ex army.

918
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:54,970
He purposely makes pro Taliban quips to
Piss me off as I'm in a position I can't

919
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:59,090
do much about it.

920
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:04,520
His intent to anger works,
but I don't show it.

921
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:09,440
What's some advice? Yeah, I
mean this guy's just a, just,

922
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,430
just completely ignore them, you
know? And I actually, you know, hey,

923
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,240
that's funny man. Cool. Yeah.

924
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,460
He's obviously trying to get under your
skin and just don't let them get under

925
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:22,130
your skin. That's just
all there is to it. Um,

926
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:26,400
this person is a worthless
and just ignore him. I mean,

927
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:28,050
you could go to the extreme of taking,

928
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,760
like in Mark's mission where mark
actually gets in on the joke,

929
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:38,130
you know? And if you want it, you
know, but then you might be crossing.

930
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,791
I again,

931
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:43,080
I don't know the specifics
of the situation because
there's times where that's

932
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:47,220
not like, I wouldn't do that
in certain situations. I got
like, no, I'll ignore you,

933
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,860
but I'm not going to play along with
this joke the way you're saying it,

934
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:52,810
but there's times where I'd be
like, Oh yeah, guess what? You know,

935
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,390
I might play along with a joke just to
diffuse it again. If this might be a,

936
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:02,640
this might be a guy that doesn't deserve
that, but, uh, yeah, ignore it, man. Go.

937
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,250
Don't even worry about this
idiot. That's, that's my advice.

938
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,190
Yeah, that ignore thing. You do that
super good where it's literally like,

939
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:14,150
he, you feel like you
don't, you got no feedback.

940
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,260
From my little joke,

941
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,880
like if I make a joke to you or something
and it's almost like did he not hear

942
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,030
my joke cause he just sort of
moved on, you know, kind of thing.

943
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,530
And it's really compelling me to like
not tell that joke anymore, you know,

944
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:32,060
kind of thing. And I'm assuming
it works real good actually.

945
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:37,280
Um, and he actually did have an
example, like the guy would say, hey,

946
00:54:37,281 --> 00:54:39,950
you're eating the Taliban with this,
with the check this week.

947
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:42,890
Like I don't know if the check is
junk or this week's check. Anyway.

948
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,280
So it seems like he's trying to be funny.
You know,

949
00:54:46,281 --> 00:54:48,710
like now he's not trying to be a dick
to the guy alone when he says he's

950
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,670
purposely trying to piss them off.
And so for me,

951
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,070
if you're purposely trying to piss me off,
me getting pissed off as you running,

952
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,330
that's the pay. I'm not going to
let that happen. We're going to win.

953
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,190
How am I going to win by
not getting pissed off?

954
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,840
And you're a little and your ignore tactic
that you do in real life, by the way.

955
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:10,370
And I'm not saying like the ignore where
you're like, like a little kid again,

956
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:13,820
doors like a little chaotic, just ignore
them and they like turn their back.

957
00:55:13,821 --> 00:55:18,500
Now it's like, oh yeah, you
know, just like, yeah, just
like meaningless. Like your,

958
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:23,860
your little quips literally
mean nothing to me whatsoever.

959
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:27,950
So whatever. Yeah, and that's a skill too,

960
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,930
which apparently you've honed over the
years because it is and you gotta you

961
00:55:32,931 --> 00:55:37,650
can't oversell it. You can't
oversell ignoring somebody
otherwise you're like, ah,

962
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,270
I got the payoff.
So you can't oversell it.

963
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:45,320
And underselling ignoring means like
you're not really ignoring I guess.

964
00:55:45,321 --> 00:55:47,540
But if you can nail it,

965
00:55:47,570 --> 00:55:51,380
if you can nail it like literally your
joke or your comments or whatever are

966
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:55,010
falling on deaf ears, you know, and
they don't like affect me at all.

967
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:56,970
If you can nail that.
Yeah,

968
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:01,330
I would say that that would compel a
normal person or this kind of person,

969
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:05,780
whatever, to stop it. Where I think that
works with everybody. Having little kids.

970
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,200
Once again, you don't make a spectacle out
of yourself. It's going to let it roll.

971
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:12,260
Like you're not making a spectacle
of like I'm ignoring you don't make a

972
00:56:12,261 --> 00:56:13,730
spectacle of like shut up,

973
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:18,350
you just play it in the metal
and you just go because,

974
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,550
because there's things in
life that don't matter.

975
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:24,220
I'm not saying

976
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,960
that you, that there, that there's,

977
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,160
that there's things that you don't react
to because there certainly are. Yeah.

978
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:33,580
And I'm not saying that you want to
be this neutral person through for all

979
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:36,940
things,
but there's things that just don't matter.

980
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,270
There's things that just, they just
don't matter. And this is one of them.

981
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,840
This guy doesn't matter what is,
who is this guy? It doesn't matter.

982
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:47,260
So don't put any effort into
them. Just stay neutral. Oh,

983
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,930
give him a smile and a nod and
keep doing what you're doing.

984
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,380
Another tip too for this, don't tell
other people like, oh that pissing me off.

985
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,980
And then you forgot about the ever,

986
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,820
never tell anyone when
something pisses you off. Never.

987
00:57:03,070 --> 00:57:06,490
You know that way.
Cause if you do and then you're,

988
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,930
you're nailing the ignore tactic,
you're nailing delivery perfectly.

989
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,460
Someone else. And then you told, you
told your friend or whatever, like, Hey,

990
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,420
that guy knows that all,
he's just ignoring me by
that really pisses them off,

991
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:21,420
you know, so they'll
just keep doing it. And,

992
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,910
and here's the thing too about
playing the game. Like come or,

993
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:27,610
or going along with the joke like ha yeah,
that's funny.

994
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,000
You just base,
you kind of involve yourself in the game.

995
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,700
He's not getting the pay off necessarily,

996
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,750
but he'll just change this tactic because
you're still in the game where you

997
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,570
want to, you want to get
out of the game. That's why,

998
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:40,300
that's why in that particular
situation, um, you know,

999
00:57:40,301 --> 00:57:43,770
mark and Mark's mission was trying
to befriend. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1000
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,450
So that's a different situation.

1001
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:51,451
He's not just trying to diffuse or he's
trying to actually befriend him and so

1002
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:54,910
then he needed to make a connection.
That's the clear difference.

1003
00:57:55,390 --> 00:58:00,220
If this guy was like a coworker or a boss
or a subordinate and trying to build a

1004
00:58:00,221 --> 00:58:04,420
relationship with, then I might take
a little step, you know? And again,

1005
00:58:04,510 --> 00:58:06,820
am I going to joke about
somebody being pro Taliban?

1006
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I'm not probably joking
about the Taliban very much.

1007
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,930
No. Yeah. Cool. Next question.

1008
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:22,510
Is it better to remain single if you
have a dangerous or demanding career in

1009
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:27,511
order to protect your family from
unintended negative consequences or find a

1010
00:58:27,731 --> 00:58:31,450
partner willing to embrace the
risk and raise were kids together?

1011
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:34,240
Hey Man,
uh,

1012
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:38,890
it's hard to live the life and it's a
lot harder on your family than it is on

1013
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:43,060
you because you'll be over getting after
it and your family will be at home not

1014
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:47,980
knowing what's going on with
you. So it's hard. But I mean,

1015
00:58:47,981 --> 00:58:52,981
obviously having kids and raising
a little warrior kids with a,

1016
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:56,560
with a partner that's in the game is,
is awesome.

1017
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,320
It's hard to find someone
to get married to.

1018
00:58:59,321 --> 00:59:04,000
That's that good to go in the game,
especially if they're real young.

1019
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,970
So I got real lucky. I married a
girl that kind of got it. We'll say.

1020
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:11,040
And,

1021
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:16,040
and I said this when I was
on Ben Shapiro's show that
the quality that she had

1022
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,520
and still has,
that I think is,

1023
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:22,130
is the most important is,

1024
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,480
um, emotional independence. And I
don't even know if that's a thing.

1025
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:29,300
I don't know if I just made that up.
But that's the trying to describe that.

1026
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:32,450
You know,
my wife doesn't need the,

1027
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:36,710
the hey honey from me.
She doesn't need to like a hey,

1028
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,950
how's everything going? She doesn't
need that from me. She's fine.

1029
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:43,760
She's emotionally independent and,

1030
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:48,560
and of course she's independent in the
way that she can take care of whatever

1031
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:52,580
the kids and the puke and kids and the
kids diapers and the kids with and the

1032
00:59:52,581 --> 00:59:54,790
broken water heater and
the flat tire on the car.

1033
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:57,710
You can handle all that stuff too.
When I was gone a lot.

1034
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:01,670
But most important is she could,

1035
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:07,260
she didn't need the constant like
emotional recharge from me cause she's a

1036
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,910
independent,
stable human being of her own.

1037
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:14,000
So I think that's the kind of
thing you've got to look for. Now,

1038
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:19,001
unfortunately a lot of times dudes
are attracted to the person that's

1039
01:00:20,541 --> 01:00:23,570
emotionally dependent on them because
it makes them a little ego boost and it

1040
01:00:23,571 --> 01:00:28,400
makes them feel good. Like, oh she
needs me around. And it's like,

1041
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:30,170
that's so,
so you've gotta watch out for that.

1042
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:32,990
You've got to find someone that kind
of has their own thing going on,

1043
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:38,200
which also has to be balanced because
if you find a female that is too has too

1044
01:00:38,961 --> 01:00:43,070
much independence, then guess what? She
ain't gonna be around when you go home,

1045
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:48,370
you gotta find somebody else. So you've
got to find that balance as well. Uh,

1046
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,530
but if you can find that right person,
don't rush into it.

1047
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:56,360
Take your time and, and, and
she's in the game then. Yeah,

1048
01:00:56,361 --> 01:01:01,040
man. Get after it. I got to say.

1049
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:05,720
That's a good question. Yeah, it is.
And you know, a lot of times guys, guys,

1050
01:01:05,721 --> 01:01:07,460
and here's another,
like this is just an,

1051
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,960
it's an answer that's not really an
answer. And yet it's fully an answer. Hey,

1052
01:01:11,961 --> 01:01:14,420
I'm married and I'm thinking
about going the seal teams.

1053
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:17,750
So what will this do to my
marriage? It's like, oh,

1054
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:20,150
there's a 50% chance your marriage,

1055
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,480
he's going to get destroyed because
you're going to be gone all the time.

1056
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,910
Your wife is going to
be jealous of the teams.

1057
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,680
She's going to be jealous of the travel.

1058
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,600
She's going to be pissed
that you're not home.

1059
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,310
She's going to be pissed
that when you get home,

1060
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,930
you're going to the bar with your boys
instead of going to the recital for the

1061
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,090
daughter. Like that's,
that's a reality. So yeah,

1062
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,670
I can't recommend it.
At the same time,

1063
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:46,940
if you're squared away and you have a good
relationship, yeah, that'll be awesome.

1064
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:50,690
That'll be awesome. But it's, it's
a really hard, like when guys,

1065
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:55,400
when I meet a guy that's 19 years old, 20
years old, and he says, yeah, he know him.

1066
01:01:55,550 --> 01:02:00,550
I'm going to buds and I'm getting married
this summer before I go straight up.

1067
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:05,270
That's a bad idea. That's a
bad idea. Don't do that. If
you're in that situation,

1068
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:08,330
don't do that because if you are,

1069
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:11,300
if you have a great relationship
with that person, you say, look,

1070
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,820
I'm going to go through buds.
I'm going to be focused on that.

1071
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:16,460
It's going to take me some time.
I'm going to show up at a team.

1072
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,950
I'm going to go on deployment.
I'm going to come home.

1073
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,510
It's going to take about three
years for all this to happen.

1074
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:23,880
When we get done with,
when I get done with all that,

1075
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,240
we'll get married because we are so strong
and so tight that we can get through

1076
01:02:29,971 --> 01:02:32,910
three years without, you
know, being married. We cool.

1077
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,820
Let's see what kind of
response you get from that

1078
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:42,360
because it's its non committal, right?
Cause it's showing, uh, the female, Hey,

1079
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:45,030
I'm noncommittal when actually
you're saying, listen,

1080
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,730
it's not that I'm noncommittal. I don't
even know what I holds in the future.

1081
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,680
I don't know what the future holds for me.
It's going to be crazy.

1082
01:02:49,681 --> 01:02:50,760
I don't know what's going to happen.

1083
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:52,650
I don't want to drag you
through a bunch of crap.

1084
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:58,070
Let's just pause on moving forward with
the marriage part and once we get done

1085
01:02:59,971 --> 01:03:03,030
with that, you know,
gimme gimme two years.

1086
01:03:03,031 --> 01:03:05,910
Give me three years and then you can
see if you still want to be around you,

1087
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:08,280
you think you want to be around
right now you haven't had it.

1088
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:12,510
You haven't had a dude that's going on
deployment for seven months after he gets

1089
01:03:12,511 --> 01:03:15,420
done with a one year workup
where I was gone in 12 months,

1090
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:19,710
I was gone nine months. That's
a whole nother thing. You,

1091
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:24,630
you may not want to be in that
situation, you know, ma'am.

1092
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,900
So if you're in that situation,
yeah,

1093
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:32,070
don't get married and don't do
people pull it off sometimes. Yeah.

1094
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:35,090
Flint and Cochran got
married I think before buds.

1095
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:39,600
And so that's, that's a one guy. But,

1096
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:44,630
but it's a rare occasion and most of
the time it doesn't work out as well as

1097
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:48,460
Flint. It worked out for Flint.
Why did it work out for fluid?

1098
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:53,480
One of the reasons he married a girl that
is emotionally independent and can do

1099
01:03:54,391 --> 01:03:58,650
her own thing and wasn't waiting
on, you know, that that debt,

1100
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,170
emotional boost,
you know?

1101
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,780
So there you go.

1102
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,200
I sent the SA and here's the final answer.
It's like,

1103
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:11,670
you know what the right answer is.
You actually know it.

1104
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:15,730
So many questions you actually know the
answer to when you want reinforcement of

1105
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,700
them and,
but,

1106
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:22,730
but the only person that can answer these
questions is you the person you got to

1107
01:04:23,191 --> 01:04:24,820
listen to what I'm saying? Sure. Yeah.

1108
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:28,530
But you got to look at your
future spouse and be like,

1109
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,950
or po potential spouse.
You're the one that knows.

1110
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:37,110
Now what's hard is guys,
especially guys,

1111
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:42,390
they go head over heels for
females. Yeah, they go crazy.

1112
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:47,400
They go nuts. They don't even
see straight. Yeah you can't.

1113
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,140
I had guys in seal platoons where
I was like, listen, hey bro,

1114
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:56,370
this girl that you're involved with
right now is going to ruin your life.

1115
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,730
I want to tell you that.
Let me tell you what she's done so far.

1116
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,170
You're not married yet.

1117
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,940
I know you want to get married in two
weeks so far she stole your credit card.

1118
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:13,490
She's called the command four times to
request to talk to the master chief about

1119
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:18,040
your orders. This girl's a
nightmare. Please do not marry

1120
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,840
her and guys are like,
Bro, you don't understand

1121
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,850
and that's the way guys do.
And how do I know that?

1122
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:29,460
Cause I was the same idiot when
when you're 15 years old, oh my God.

1123
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:33,940
It's the only, no. It's like, no,
that's not the only girl. It's not.

1124
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:38,240
There's more. So just calm
down if you can. If you,

1125
01:05:38,241 --> 01:05:42,130
if the marriage is meant to be,
let it be, but let it be in a year.

1126
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:45,010
Let it happen in here.
Don't be getting married in three months.

1127
01:05:45,011 --> 01:05:47,980
Don't be getting married in two months.
Don't, don't get married in six months.

1128
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:52,720
Get married in a year. Get married
in a year and a half. Do me a favor.

1129
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,770
Do yourself a favor to us.
Do us all a favor.

1130
01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:02,290
There you go. Sounds like sound
advice. Thank you. Next question.

1131
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:07,210
Could you talk about how you read a book
to get so much out of it that you do?

1132
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,360
Yeah. Um, here's what I do. When
I read a book, I read the book.

1133
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,570
As I'm reading the book, I highlight
the important parts of the book.

1134
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:19,260
Then I go back through and reread
what I highlight and pull out the pre,

1135
01:06:19,450 --> 01:06:23,590
the, the Creme de la creme of the
information, another small thick.

1136
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,560
If you're reading a book where there's
lots of characters right down the

1137
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:29,110
characters and kind of like give them
a description so you can refer back to

1138
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:30,100
them when they show back up again.

1139
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:33,970
Cause sometimes I'll lose track of
characters if it's a complex book and you

1140
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:38,620
just don't, you just don't know. Um,
so that's what I do. I read slowly.

1141
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:42,220
I actually, it's horrible. I
wish I read faster. I read it.

1142
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:45,250
The speed that I talk just about,
I'd read a little bit faster,

1143
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,090
but it's just about the speed that
I talk and I read every single word.

1144
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:53,500
And when I will say this, when I do read
a book slowly and like I do read it,

1145
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,170
I remember a lot from the book,
which is cool,

1146
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:01,490
but read it slowly, highlight it,
take notes. There you go. Hmm.

1147
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:06,490
Makes Sense. Next question.
What was plying beat?

1148
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:10,750
If you rang the bell, there
was no, I wasn't going to ring.

1149
01:07:10,751 --> 01:07:13,420
Your Bell wasn't going to happen.
It's seriously wasn't going to happen.

1150
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:16,480
And but well here's what
could have happened. Injury.

1151
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:22,020
You can get injured in buds and some
injuries are more permit preventative,

1152
01:07:22,301 --> 01:07:25,450
like Shin splints.
If you trained properly beforehand,

1153
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:30,070
you probably won't get Shin splints. But
if you're doing a rock portage and you,

1154
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:34,810
there's big waves and you're bringing
a boat, a Zodiac boat or uh, uh, IBS,

1155
01:07:34,811 --> 01:07:39,040
boat up the rocks in big waves,
you can just get your knee broke.

1156
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,310
Like it can happen. So then what would
have happened if I would've gotten,

1157
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:46,300
I would've gone to the
fleet, healed up, come back.

1158
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:49,660
So what I would have done it again.
You got to try again. It's a,

1159
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,810
that's one of the scariest things about
buds from a guy that like the guys that

1160
01:07:55,091 --> 01:07:59,480
I know that we're like, yeah, we're never
gonna quit, but they, there's a possible,

1161
01:07:59,481 --> 01:08:03,610
you're going to get injured. Can you
get real? They call it rolled, right?

1162
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:06,310
You can get rolled back, eat.
Like even if you get sick, right?

1163
01:08:06,311 --> 01:08:09,250
Like a doctor can be like, hey, you
can't continue. Yep. That can happen.

1164
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,930
That can happen. That happens.
The guys in hell week,

1165
01:08:10,931 --> 01:08:15,410
they'll get pneumonia and they're
just, they can't, like, they're,

1166
01:08:15,411 --> 01:08:19,220
they're not quitting.
But they're coughing up blood,

1167
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:24,740
they're speeding blood out of their mouth
and you're like, and the doctor's like,

1168
01:08:24,741 --> 01:08:27,080
Hey, are you okay? I'm fine.

1169
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:33,380
And so they just have to, they
just have to get rolled back. Yeah.

1170
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,280
It happens. There's very few people
that don't get rolled back. Oh yeah.

1171
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,670
It's a pretty small number that don't
get rolled back at all. Really? Yeah.

1172
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:46,120
Like for medical, medical failure. If you
fail something, you can get more about.

1173
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:48,200
If you fail a run,
I forget why.

1174
01:08:48,201 --> 01:08:51,260
I don't know what it is right now when I
went through, if you failed to run, okay,

1175
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:55,040
you gotta write up. If you felt another
run, you've got rolled back. See,

1176
01:08:55,180 --> 01:09:00,020
good to do the whole thing again. Got
To do the whole thing, not just the run.

1177
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,840
You got to do everything
again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The
whole thing was a nightmare.

1178
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:06,740
So I failed.
I'll run

1179
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:09,093
a swim

1180
01:09:10,590 --> 01:09:15,110
a obstacle course like,
and then you just freaked out.

1181
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,730
I was so paranoid. I think you
could actually, when I went through,

1182
01:09:19,731 --> 01:09:24,470
you could fail one per phase. So there was
three phases. First Phase, second phase,

1183
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:28,560
third phase. You could fail like one
of each thing per phase, which is,

1184
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:30,410
which sounds really lenient,

1185
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:34,100
but Dang you're doing because
you're doing a timed run every week,

1186
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:39,380
a timed run every week,
and then you're doing a million.

1187
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:41,210
They just call them a conditioning runs,

1188
01:09:41,211 --> 01:09:46,211
which is the most understated
name for run ever,

1189
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:50,780
because what they really were is just
the most grueling as fast as you could go

1190
01:09:50,781 --> 01:09:55,220
through the soft sand runs
for how long for no, no,

1191
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,330
no dude, no, and not only that, you ran,

1192
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,090
you ran to breakfast and back
then Randall, lunch and back,

1193
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:04,370
we rented dinner and back in each
one of those runs was one mile,

1194
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:08,100
so there's six miles before you ran
anywhere before you conditioning,

1195
01:10:08,101 --> 01:10:11,900
you run and your time drawn.
You're doing a six mile run every day.

1196
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,880
Just that's awesome.
That is not a sprint.

1197
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:19,950
Sometimes you have to run fast. Sometimes
you run slow, but it's just like a sh.

1198
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:23,990
A lot of times it's just a little, you
know, typical military shuffle. Yeah.

1199
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:29,810
So yeah, when I was, no man.

1200
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,970
Next question.

1201
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:36,560
What actual strategy should do you get
to white belt employed during a role

1202
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,210
other than relaxed tap early,
tap off and like touch her.

1203
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:40,400
All those are other key points.

1204
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:42,980
But the other thing is I would say try
and do moves that you've actually learned

1205
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,580
instead of instead of doing
something that you, that you, uh,

1206
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:50,630
just like your spazzing out trying to
do some random thing and actually do

1207
01:10:50,631 --> 01:10:51,464
something that you know,

1208
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:54,050
and if you get in a situation
that you don't know what to do,

1209
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,890
remember the situation you were in
such, you can ask an instructor, hey,

1210
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,850
here's where I was. I didn't know what
Duke, can you please help me? Simple.

1211
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:07,010
Pretty straight forward.
The question,

1212
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,670
if a coworker were attempting to bully,
intimidate,

1213
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:13,980
or make you generally miserable,
do you go with it?

1214
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:19,560
Would you make a mention of your
Jujitsu knowledge or keep it a surprise?

1215
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,380
I like that question. Oh yeah,
I would keep it. Um, I'm,

1216
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,950
I keep everything a surprise.
Right?

1217
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:33,360
I just keep everything.
I'm surprised because I'm not here like,

1218
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:38,160
you know, are they are digital, you better
back off, you know, like what is that?

1219
01:11:38,370 --> 01:11:42,870
And instead you're just like,
hey man, all good. Hmm. You know,

1220
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:47,340
and then let that guy find out for
himself that, you know the hardwood. Yeah.

1221
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:49,410
Either the hard way or
someone will be like, hey man,

1222
01:11:49,411 --> 01:11:52,110
you know that guy that you keep messing
with? Like I train Jujitsu every day.

1223
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:54,930
He's going to choke you out and put you
to sleep and then guess what he's gonna

1224
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:57,090
do. He's gonna get mouthy.
Cause he's already been,

1225
01:11:57,540 --> 01:12:02,180
he's already been testing you and he's
like, oh, he's kind of a wimp. So yeah,

1226
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,730
I mean there's no, like, is there even a
cool way you can say I trained Jujitsu?

1227
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:11,880
No, because even if you pull it off
externally, like internally, you're like,

1228
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:15,450
you know who said it?
John Claude van Damme.

1229
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:20,280
Heuler Gracie Coiler Gracie was surfing.
Yeah.

1230
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:23,230
And I think kid Pellagra told me this
story, but it might've been Hawaii that,

1231
01:12:23,231 --> 01:12:27,270
that told me this, he was surfing
and somebody wanted to, you know,

1232
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,140
give them some beef getting up. And
you wanted somebody wanting to do like,

1233
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,620
you know, hey, what are you doing out here
in type thing? And he was like, you know,

1234
01:12:34,621 --> 01:12:37,560
he did what I would do with like, you
know, he just kept surfing kind of,

1235
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:41,700
and then the person started talking more
and then he started running his mouth

1236
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:44,700
and then heuler said something like,

1237
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,280
Hey,
you like to surf?

1238
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,340
I like to fight. If you want
to fight, we can do that.

1239
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,650
And uh, I thought that was a
pretty cool way of saying it.

1240
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:02,750
He told that story I think of,

1241
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,970
unless he told another time to you at
Brian's sergeants promotion to black belt.

1242
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,830
I think kids really grew
through too. I forget, but yes,

1243
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:13,290
he told me he told that
story to the group.

1244
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,200
He told it to me and I thought that I
was there. Right. Yeah, he was. Yeah.

1245
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:23,520
I thought there was like kind
of more cooler than that.
Said it cooler than that.

1246
01:13:23,521 --> 01:13:27,780
He said it some way that was like,
yeah, listen, you like to fight.

1247
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,310
You like to surf for your life.

1248
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:33,720
I find that you surf for a living.

1249
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:36,990
I fight for a living. It was
something even more than what I said,

1250
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:37,860
but it was good.
Yeah,

1251
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:41,130
we can find the kind of concern for it
was the kind of thing where you're like,

1252
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:43,580
if you were that guy,
you think you know, yeah,

1253
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,920
maybe I'll not do this
whole thing right now.

1254
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,200
I remember thinking the same thing as you,

1255
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:51,720
like think that was a really
dope way to say it. You know?

1256
01:13:52,590 --> 01:13:56,100
Plus like you know that that guy,
obviously he didn't know who that was.

1257
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:57,970
I'm assuming it,

1258
01:13:57,980 --> 01:14:01,500
which would be kind of crazy if he did
it or if he did know who he was, but,

1259
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:05,880
and then what if hypothetically
later he found out who that was.

1260
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:11,500
Occasionally I've had people say things
like, uh, like they kind of know who said,

1261
01:14:11,501 --> 01:14:14,810
they'll say like, oh, you know, let's
go. You got something like that. Yeah.

1262
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,880
And it's like, yeah, man, cool. I, that's
always my answer. Oh, awesome. Yeah. Cool.

1263
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,210
Do you want to go now? And then they're
always like, [inaudible]. Just kidding.

1264
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:27,010
Cool. All right, next question.

1265
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:31,880
What do you typically wear when you
meet the bosses of companies? And why?

1266
01:14:32,130 --> 01:14:35,650
Oh Amen.
If you're working with echelon front,

1267
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:40,030
then pretty much what we all,
where's the ETF Polo?

1268
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:44,920
The echelon front, a polo shirt.
And you know, we, we, we called the,

1269
01:14:44,921 --> 01:14:47,470
what we were business tactical,

1270
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:51,130
just polo shirt and a pair of pants.

1271
01:14:51,490 --> 01:14:55,560
And why the question is why?
Well that's just because it's a,

1272
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:58,220
to me it's the same kind of
thing I've been talking about.

1273
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:01,240
Just sort of a normal
thing to wear. Right. Um,

1274
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,960
don't really travel as much as
I travel as little as possible.

1275
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:08,260
I came with a full suit and yeah.

1276
01:15:08,261 --> 01:15:13,210
So just comfort and functionality.
Yeah, there's the answer. Yeah.

1277
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,780
And of course he won't show up
in your shorts. Yeah, no, no.

1278
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:18,390
We're professional in rash guard.
Yeah.

1279
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:24,300
He used to wear a suit, right?
Like back in the, yeah, I mean,

1280
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:29,200
and I still wear will wear a
suit sometimes, but usually
not, man. Usually not.

1281
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:32,380
You know, even, um, usually people,

1282
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,790
people know who we are now and
so if we're going to show up,

1283
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:39,190
they realize what they're getting,
which is like, hey these guys are,

1284
01:15:39,490 --> 01:15:42,850
these guys are going to come in and
talk to us and they didn't know what the

1285
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:45,010
deal is.
Yeah there's all the footage of us on,

1286
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:48,970
on the videos and stuff were
wearing kind of the eff uniform.

1287
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:53,230
So business tactical, get
some. All right, next question.

1288
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:57,820
And I guess there is a, there is a uh,
a small bit of like, hey we're not,

1289
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:03,670
we're not standard business
people. You know what I mean? Yeah,

1290
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:04,720
that makes sense.
Okay.

1291
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:08,830
Like you're in a room with people with
a bunch of suits on and they're like,

1292
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:09,820
oh who's presenting?

1293
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:12,520
Oh it's that guy over there cause
he's wearing something different.

1294
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:13,780
Okay we get it.
You know what I mean?

1295
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:18,010
We're just a little identifier
echelon front on the shirt.

1296
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,470
All good. Good. How do you grill better,

1297
01:16:23,471 --> 01:16:28,240
faster, stronger with your romantic
partner over time without being a brute?

1298
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,800
I just,
I don't even,

1299
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:32,890
I just kind of had to put this
question in here cause it was,

1300
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,750
I don't really understand.
I mean,

1301
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:38,680
just because you're bigger and faster and
stronger, it doesn't mean Europe boot.

1302
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:42,500
Right. What, what does that,
how do you overcome that and
be nice to your, you know,

1303
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:47,760
your girlfriend or your wife, um,
what's the, your romantic partner?

1304
01:16:47,761 --> 01:16:48,790
Like what does that mean though?

1305
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:53,791
Like if you're working out with your
romantic partner or like you're getting

1306
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:57,580
bigger and faster and stronger
and therefore you start
treating your girlfriend

1307
01:16:57,581 --> 01:17:01,050
like cracked. I'm like
no, it's like no dude.

1308
01:17:01,930 --> 01:17:04,540
Actually you'll probably be nicer because
you're bigger, faster and stronger.

1309
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,610
So it's kind of a non question I guess.

1310
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,180
But I just thought it was
funny is cause you fake.

1311
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,160
You think, Hey, I'm in it,
I'm going to do squats today.

1312
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:15,220
Then I'm just going to [inaudible]

1313
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:22,330
being a Brit,
the being a brute,

1314
01:17:22,730 --> 01:17:26,120
that part I can see, I could see
that, you know, cause you know,

1315
01:17:26,121 --> 01:17:30,570
like let's say like you gained
20 pounds, 30 pounds. It's just,

1316
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,490
and it's like all muscle. You're super
strong now. You know. I don't know.

1317
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,020
And you know, you come home, you're just
more of a, like the stuff that you do,

1318
01:17:39,021 --> 01:17:43,550
you know your fact Kimmy, you know,
like you're just way more brutish.

1319
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,580
You are. Yes. So Do, so
I dunno. Vacuum a harder,

1320
01:17:47,310 --> 01:17:51,090
oh you gotta vacuum with more finesse.
You gotta focus on the finesse part of it.

1321
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:56,510
Otherwise you're going to be all big,
fast and strong. That the, and I um,

1322
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:59,270
I think I understand the question,
but here's a,

1323
01:17:59,271 --> 01:18:04,271
here's a tip that I haven't been
married forever but significantly long.

1324
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:10,310
Here's what I found out. Like a lot of
stuff, like as a guy you think like,

1325
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,800
Hey, I'm not really going to do that
because that's not important. You know,

1326
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:19,640
like you have a set of things that you
think are important and they're based on

1327
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:22,490
certain ways of thinking and the girl's
going to have things she thinks is

1328
01:18:22,491 --> 01:18:24,450
important. And in my
experience, which I to,

1329
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:29,460
from what I understand is very common
that the things that some girls think are

1330
01:18:31,281 --> 01:18:32,060
important,

1331
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:36,230
they can't really put their finger on it
or why they feel important or whatever.

1332
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:39,890
But they just do, you know? And the guy
will be like, hey, that's an unimportant.

1333
01:18:39,891 --> 01:18:44,420
You can't even explain why it's important.
Therefore I win the whole importance,

1334
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,410
significance argument, right?
So at the end of the day,

1335
01:18:48,411 --> 01:18:50,840
they're not going to do these
things. Just little things, you know,

1336
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,480
show me that you care.
Like these sensitive things,

1337
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:57,680
things that go against being faster,
stronger,

1338
01:18:57,860 --> 01:18:58,693
more brutish.

1339
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,320
But if you can keep in mind
that little little things,

1340
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,910
even if you don't think
they're significant,

1341
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:09,650
actually do make your
romantic partner happy.

1342
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:14,210
And if you can consist consistently
maintain that regardless of how big,

1343
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:16,670
fast or strong you get that oil,

1344
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:21,170
she's going to embrace your big bigness,
fastness and strongness.

1345
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,280
Take her from me. I know.
Cool. Next question.

1346
01:19:27,530 --> 01:19:31,070
In cooperation and negotiation,

1347
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:36,100
is there a tell to know
when you're breaking your
personal code and compromising

1348
01:19:36,950 --> 01:19:38,620
too much?
Is,

1349
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:43,730
is it a gut check or is it gut check
or logical? This is a weird one.

1350
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,560
There's a kind of a confusing question,

1351
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:50,390
so I'll just kind of kind of a answer
it to the best of my ability. Well,

1352
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,640
the biggest thing I notice when I'm,

1353
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:55,490
when I'm interacting with other people,

1354
01:19:55,491 --> 01:20:00,491
the biggest thing that I pay
attention to is am I paying it to him?

1355
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:07,480
Do I care about this particular
thing because of me or because

1356
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,930
of it's going to help the team. Yeah.
And if you can get through that, if you,

1357
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:16,200
if you really just say to yourself,
Hey,

1358
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:19,770
am I doing this because I'm
going to help the team or my,

1359
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:23,790
am I doing this because it's about me?
If you pay attention to those things,

1360
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:27,210
and I'm not saying that every time
that you say, hey, you know what,

1361
01:20:27,211 --> 01:20:31,290
I need to take care of me a little bit
because you have to remember that you

1362
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:33,150
have your strategic goals too.
Right?

1363
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:39,090
But most of the time the success of
the team is going to help you strategic

1364
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:43,800
goals now. So for me, I'm,
my constant thing is, hey,

1365
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:47,790
why am I, why? Why does this
concern me? Does it concern me?

1366
01:20:48,380 --> 01:20:50,820
It's basically does this
concern because my ego or not,

1367
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,950
and if it doesn't concern
me because of my ego,

1368
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:55,320
that it concerns me because it's
not going to benefit the team.

1369
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,500
So let's help the team.
So that's, that's what I,

1370
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:03,330
that's what I look at the most when
I'm negotiating, when I'm cooperating,

1371
01:21:03,331 --> 01:21:06,900
you know, if, if, if you and I
were negotiating a deal, right?

1372
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:12,620
And I was going to buy a
car from you and I was like,

1373
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,621
you know,

1374
01:21:13,621 --> 01:21:17,640
you want to sell it for me to for 10
grand and I want to get it for nine,

1375
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:21,510
how much of it? And you're like,
okay, you know what, Jocko, I,

1376
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:26,720
I got it on the lot for for 8,800 can
you give me $400 over the what I paid for

1377
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:35,040
it and give me 9,200 or
whatever. And I'm like, no,

1378
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,480
I'll only, how much of that is
me? Just, it was just my ego.

1379
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:42,240
I just want to win the ego fight against
you. And how much of it is me? Like, Hey,

1380
01:21:42,241 --> 01:21:45,840
that's actually a pretty good deal. Yeah.
And, and why not take care of this guy?

1381
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:48,180
Because I don't know. I don't
really know you, but hey man,

1382
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:52,140
maybe we'll buy something else in
the future. Maybe I'll, you'll have,

1383
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:57,030
you know what I mean? So am I trying,
is it my ego or is it just a bad deal?

1384
01:21:57,031 --> 01:22:00,420
If you're like, hey, nope, it's 11,000
and I'm like, okay, you know what?

1385
01:22:00,421 --> 01:22:02,820
I'm not going to pay that.
So it's not, it's not my ego.

1386
01:22:02,821 --> 01:22:05,280
That's just not a good deal at 10 grand.

1387
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:09,720
It's not a great deal at 9,200 it's
a pretty damn good deal for me.

1388
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:10,741
And it's,

1389
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:13,710
you're going to make some money and I'm
happy that you're going to make some

1390
01:22:13,711 --> 01:22:15,870
money. Cool. You know what? Let's
shake hands. Let's make a deal.

1391
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,540
There's times where this is the,
so this is the point.

1392
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:21,870
There's times where it
my ego, I'll be like, no,

1393
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,470
I don't care. I don't care if
you're only going to make 200 bucks,

1394
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:28,020
that's that's your problem.
You should have paid so much.

1395
01:22:28,950 --> 01:22:31,200
When in my heart I know like,
Hey, that's actually a good deal.

1396
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:32,220
I'm getting a really good deal,

1397
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,800
but my ego is not letting me have closed
close it. Um, that can be a death.

1398
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:37,643
That can be a problem.

1399
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:41,580
So when I'm negotiating with
someone and it's not a good deal,

1400
01:22:41,581 --> 01:22:43,890
they're not going to get me
to do what they want me to do.

1401
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,870
It's just not going to happen. If it's
a fair deal, hey, we'll make it work.

1402
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,360
It was not a fair deal.
It's going to be problematic.

1403
01:22:52,250 --> 01:22:56,670
You don't want to present me with unfair
deals because I will not be accepting

1404
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:01,410
them. Also. Does it seem
like it's more of a question,

1405
01:23:01,411 --> 01:23:05,980
I guess you kind of got
to like be to yourself

1406
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:08,110
like consciously too,
right? Because when you,

1407
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:10,270
cause you give it like how you said
you got to ask yourself, is this,

1408
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:13,540
is this good for me and my ego
or is this good for the team?

1409
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:17,430
Like as far as me not
compromising my, uh, you know,

1410
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:21,280
not compromising or my personal code or
whatever and there's values that I will

1411
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:24,910
not compromise. There's values that
I will not compromise. It would,

1412
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,700
I would think that that'd be for
a very specific reason. You know,

1413
01:23:27,701 --> 01:23:30,010
you know how like some people there'll
be like, I'm just not like that,

1414
01:23:30,011 --> 01:23:31,720
but they don't really know why.
Like, Hey, well I don't know.

1415
01:23:31,721 --> 01:23:36,190
Maybe cause my dad told me that one time
when we were fishing or whatever it,

1416
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,970
so there's a difference. This is what
I'm saying. So, but here's the thing,

1417
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:43,270
and I say this because this is what I'll
do. Sometimes I'll be like, hey, you know,

1418
01:23:43,271 --> 01:23:46,600
this is more important because of,
you know,

1419
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:50,260
I don't know my hell oh you'll
rationalize. Yeah. You know,

1420
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:55,420
and yeah, essentially like
twist the truth to myself too.

1421
01:23:55,421 --> 01:24:00,421
To kind of explain to myself
again how important this is,

1422
01:24:00,971 --> 01:24:05,110
you know, for the team, you know, one
of those things, if that's important.

1423
01:24:05,111 --> 01:24:09,430
There's other ways to do that. To
your point, that's what I'm saying,

1424
01:24:09,431 --> 01:24:13,390
when I'm thinking about
decisions, I'm asking myself, Hey,

1425
01:24:13,391 --> 01:24:16,840
is this my ego or is this or am I
doing the right thing for the road?

1426
01:24:16,841 --> 01:24:20,130
For the team. Yeah. Cause there's, that's
what you should be checking on, right.

1427
01:24:20,410 --> 01:24:23,680
If you're doing it for yourself,
most 99% of the time,

1428
01:24:23,681 --> 01:24:25,960
if you're doing something for
yourself that hurts the team,

1429
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,650
the longterm is not going to
be beneficial to you. Okay.

1430
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,520
The longterm is not going to
be beneficial to you. Yeah,

1431
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:35,110
because you're doing something
for yourself. Everybody sees that.

1432
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:38,470
You don't think they see
it, but they see it. Yeah.

1433
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:43,530
So you try and do things that are going
to benefit the team and sometimes I'm

1434
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:47,860
99% of the time when you do
something that benefits team,

1435
01:24:47,861 --> 01:24:49,510
you're going to benefit from it as well.

1436
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:53,500
But you have to see the long game because
sometimes the short game it's like,

1437
01:24:53,501 --> 01:24:56,380
oh no, if I do this for the team, that
means I'm going to miss this this weekend.

1438
01:24:56,381 --> 01:24:59,500
And that sucks. Well, guess
what? In the long term,

1439
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:03,640
when you work this weekend and cover for
the other guys that couldn't make it in

1440
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:04,474
for whatever reason,

1441
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:06,820
you're going to have a better relationship
with them and they're going to come

1442
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:09,370
for free next time. It's like, it's
longterm, it's gonna be good. Yeah.

1443
01:25:09,610 --> 01:25:11,860
But you're worried about you and that's,

1444
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:15,820
that's problem playing the long game
again, always got to play that long name.

1445
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:21,400
Next question. Best Way to get
your teeth. Get you team in.

1446
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:26,770
Okay. Best Way to get your team to buy in
to your vision. Let it be their vision.

1447
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:30,100
I'll let me let the vision come from them.
Right?

1448
01:25:30,340 --> 01:25:33,580
And the more the vision comes from them,
the more the plan comes from them,

1449
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:34,660
the more they buy into it,

1450
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:37,480
the more you force the vision and
forced the plan down their throat,

1451
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:41,810
the less buy in that you're
going to get from it. Now you,

1452
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,210
if you're super persuasive, you can do
a better job of coming up with a vision.

1453
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:50,680
But why do that? Why not
say, hey guys, you know what?

1454
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:53,770
We're going to put together the
direction that this team is going.

1455
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:58,270
Give me some feedback. Give me
some bullet points. Hit me now.

1456
01:25:58,271 --> 01:26:00,850
They all come back with bullet points you
assembled together and it's like, Hey,

1457
01:26:00,851 --> 01:26:05,250
this is what we're going to go in.
Boom. Everyone's on board. That easy.

1458
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:10,730
Our plan. Yeah, so much easier with our
plan. And you if you're scared of that.

1459
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:15,470
And I think if all, if I give the team
the opportunity to come up with a plan,

1460
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,960
they're going to come up
with a plan that sucks. Well,

1461
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:20,270
how well did you train them?
If they come up with a plan that socks,

1462
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,900
you haven't trained them very well. Most
of the time. If you train them decently,

1463
01:26:23,901 --> 01:26:26,660
they're gonna come up with a plan that's
close enough to the a decent plan that

1464
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:28,610
they can go and execute it. You
weaken all, execute it together.

1465
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,960
That can be part of the vision.
Let's go,

1466
01:26:30,710 --> 01:26:31,543
Hey Jocko,

1467
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:36,760
what would be better verbal communication
with concept of prioritize and

1468
01:26:36,921 --> 01:26:38,510
execute?
When talking to my wife,

1469
01:26:39,530 --> 01:26:42,980
she oftentimes feels overwhelmed with
how many decisions she has to make.

1470
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,370
She hates when I use the words
of prioritize and execute.

1471
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:50,010
Well, the root problem there
isn't that she hates the, the,

1472
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:53,790
the words prioritize and execute.
The problem is, is that you're,

1473
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:58,550
you're telling her what
to do. That's, you know,

1474
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,770
instead of being like, hey, you know,
hey, if you just prioritize and execute,

1475
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:02,880
there's,

1476
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,330
if there's a at least an eight f at
least a 50% chance that she doesn't even

1477
01:27:06,331 --> 01:27:09,850
want to hear your suggestion. She's
just telling you, cause it's vet,

1478
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:12,720
she's venting to you. So
for you to be like, man,

1479
01:27:12,721 --> 01:27:16,290
those are a lot of decisions to make.
That's hard. If you were to say to her,

1480
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:20,070
how do you,
how do you handle this?

1481
01:27:20,071 --> 01:27:23,100
Cause I know you're doing this everyday
girl, I'm impressed. How do you do that?

1482
01:27:23,250 --> 01:27:26,190
And then she says, well, you know,
it's hard, but here's what I do.

1483
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:31,830
So if it was just a matter of
renaming it, it's like, hey,

1484
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:35,910
we'll call it, hey, you know what you
need to do is great and go, or what you,

1485
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:37,620
what you need to do is rank and role.

1486
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:43,020
What do you need to do is triage and
check off what you need to do or,

1487
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:45,150
or designate and do.
That's what, you know,

1488
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,830
there's a bunch of different
ways you could phrase it,

1489
01:27:46,831 --> 01:27:50,610
but that's not what's making
her responded in a negative way.

1490
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,190
She's responding in a negative
way cause you're saying, hey,

1491
01:27:53,191 --> 01:27:56,340
here's all you need to do is
prioritize and execute this. Know

1492
01:27:57,930 --> 01:28:01,050
what she needs is some sympathy,
some listening,

1493
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:06,450
allowing to vent, and
then you can say, hey,

1494
01:28:07,110 --> 01:28:08,940
you know,
if you've done that properly you can say,

1495
01:28:08,941 --> 01:28:13,200
well you know I did read that book and
they kind of say when there's a bunch of

1496
01:28:13,201 --> 01:28:15,090
crazy things going on
like you've got going on,

1497
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:17,880
they say to do the same
thing that I see you do,

1498
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:21,720
which is you pick the most important
one and then you kind of focus on that.

1499
01:28:22,260 --> 01:28:24,720
That's pretty cool. Can you do that?
I'm pretty well by the way you do that.

1500
01:28:24,721 --> 01:28:26,550
Well you do that really well.

1501
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,830
So just take a little different approach,
man. Yeah. It's not just the words.

1502
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:32,700
The words are not putting,

1503
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,520
I hate to break the news to your brother
words not pissing her off. You are.

1504
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:42,420
Listen to her. It seems you ever notice
some people, they'd come you a problem.

1505
01:28:42,421 --> 01:28:45,270
They don't want a solution. Oh
yeah. That happens all the time.

1506
01:28:45,271 --> 01:28:49,590
They just want you to sit there and listen
to them. My wife does that for sure.

1507
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:54,510
For sure. You know, hey, there's this
problem. Oh, why don't you do this?

1508
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,660
It's not that easy. Okay. Fuck you.

1509
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:59,850
Just tell me more about the problem
and I'll sit over here and listen.

1510
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,980
Don't say that by the

1511
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,340
way, you got to do that.
That part. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1512
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:10,110
It's almost like when he's like,
it seems like they,

1513
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:13,080
yeah. That they don't mind so much of
the suffering of the problem. Suffering.

1514
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,840
I'm overusing that word. I know, but
yeah, they don't mind the suffering.

1515
01:29:15,841 --> 01:29:19,020
They just want to, they don't want to
suffer alone. So it feel like, Oh yeah,

1516
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:24,140
I'm having like these issues of
whatever first is like, hey, come see,

1517
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:26,640
suffer with me. Sympathize,
empathize, or whatever.

1518
01:29:26,641 --> 01:29:29,970
We can suffer together that that's why
I'm coming to you in the first place so I

1519
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:31,980
can get closer to you. Whatever, whatever.

1520
01:29:31,981 --> 01:29:34,260
I don't know that I'm
totally reflect and diminish.

1521
01:29:34,261 --> 01:29:38,640
Do remember when I talked about that?
Yes. Such a good tactic in this situation.

1522
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:43,080
Reflect the emotions back to them.
Yeah, but diminish them a little bit.

1523
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:47,520
So if they're all freaking
mad about something, you go,
oh, I can't believe that.

1524
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:52,250
But you don't be as mad as them, but
you don't be, hey, calm down. You don't,

1525
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:54,800
you don't say, Hey, here's
just prioritize next cute,

1526
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,340
oh it's a rough one actually,
to be honest.

1527
01:29:59,341 --> 01:30:04,341
Like I felt that before where I'd come
to my brother's typically the one like

1528
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:07,260
I've come to him with like a problem.
And here's the thing,

1529
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:11,790
I didn't want like sympathy or empathy
primarily, but I wanted a little bit,

1530
01:30:11,970 --> 01:30:16,860
you know, so you can't just roll suit
there with your apple or whatever,

1531
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:20,070
all cash and went through, what are
you going to do is put this, you know,

1532
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:23,070
like Kinda like you're so dumb.
You get this feeling.

1533
01:30:23,071 --> 01:30:28,071
I'm not saying you want to know why your
brother or you or whoever can look at

1534
01:30:29,311 --> 01:30:31,980
that problem and like come up with
a solutions cause they're detached,

1535
01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:33,630
they're be facto detached
from the problem.

1536
01:30:33,730 --> 01:30:35,820
And so when you're all wrapped up
in the problem, you're like, hey,

1537
01:30:35,821 --> 01:30:38,070
I don't know what to do cause I got this,
this and this. And your brother's like,

1538
01:30:38,071 --> 01:30:40,830
well just do that and you're like,
you get mad.

1539
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:43,990
He's able to see what to do
because he's on the outside. Yeah.

1540
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:47,630
So if you can learn to, to
detach yourself, you won't
have to rely on getting,

1541
01:30:47,710 --> 01:30:48,840
getting other people to help you.

1542
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:52,440
If you can't detach and you're all wrapped
up in the emotions of the situation,

1543
01:30:52,441 --> 01:30:55,140
you're gonna, you're gonna have to go with
someone to help. And then when you do,

1544
01:30:55,141 --> 01:30:58,560
don't get mad at them when they
just tell you the solution.

1545
01:31:01,210 --> 01:31:05,130
But when you reverse the roles and you
take ownership of trying to provide

1546
01:31:05,131 --> 01:31:05,581
solutions,

1547
01:31:05,581 --> 01:31:08,010
you've got to realize that it's your
fault that your solution isn't being

1548
01:31:08,011 --> 01:31:09,420
welcomed here.

1549
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:13,410
And that's kind of the point where like
I'm trying to gain an understanding,

1550
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:13,650
you know,

1551
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:17,040
cause easy when your detections first
thing is like why are you complaining

1552
01:31:17,041 --> 01:31:19,490
about like, cause this is how you
feel on the front of your mind.

1553
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:20,820
You're like why are you
complaining about this?

1554
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:23,610
Why don't you just solve that problem
and never complained about it ever again.

1555
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,050
You know, that's the feeling the other
person had that detached person, the hut,

1556
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,400
you know, in this case,
the husband and whatever.

1557
01:31:30,330 --> 01:31:35,330
So what I did was I imagine my situation
that I'm on the other side where kind

1558
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,060
of like, I know what it feels like
to kind of want some sympathy.

1559
01:31:39,061 --> 01:31:41,760
I don't want sympathy and that's
it, you know? But of course,

1560
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:44,890
but I want some of it. So
imagine that feeling then. Well,

1561
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,660
I imagine that feeling that I got from
my brother at times when I come to him

1562
01:31:48,661 --> 01:31:51,210
with a problem that's
bothering me or whatever,

1563
01:31:51,450 --> 01:31:55,400
and the part and the fact that it's
bothering me means nothing. All my hands.

1564
01:31:55,410 --> 01:32:00,190
So the fact that the way he presents a
solution with no empathy and almost says,

1565
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:04,270
actually it feels like
it says you're so dumb,

1566
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:08,260
like you're dumb. You know, like why
are you wrapped up about this thing?

1567
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:11,470
You're dumb kind of thing. So
from a leadership perspective,
from his perspective,

1568
01:32:11,471 --> 01:32:15,770
he should recognize that what he needs
to do is a massager ego feel good about

1569
01:32:15,771 --> 01:32:18,460
it and be like, Oh man, that's a
hell of a problem to have. You know,

1570
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:20,700
one thing I could maybe you could do,
I don't know if you'd be up,

1571
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:21,940
I don't know if I could do it,

1572
01:32:21,941 --> 01:32:23,760
but you could probably do because you're
a little bit better at this kind of

1573
01:32:23,761 --> 01:32:26,370
thing. You just cut off just
doing that little dude. Yeah,

1574
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:29,980
that's a good tactic right there.
When you say like what, what you,

1575
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:33,550
what you kind of do kind of like,
you're like one of these individuals,

1576
01:32:33,551 --> 01:32:37,140
one of the rare people who knows how to
deal with it and it's like empowering.

1577
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:40,090
Nothing that you do that I can't
really do as see you do it though,

1578
01:32:40,091 --> 01:32:42,280
is you prioritize an accident.

1579
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:46,490
I just get all scatterbrained,

1580
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:49,840
so focus on all kinds of different things
at the same time and that's a problem.

1581
01:32:50,980 --> 01:32:53,640
There you go. Get some
next question. My worry.

1582
01:32:53,641 --> 01:32:57,070
Your kids want to know is where
your kid number three in the works.

1583
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:02,020
Yes. Warrior kid three is in
the works. I am on chapter 10.

1584
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,130
Unfortunately, I've been on
chapter 10 for a couple of days,

1585
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:09,910
not because it's taken me a long time
to write chapter 10 but I didn't write

1586
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:14,770
yesterday or the day before because
we were doing multiple podcasts,

1587
01:33:15,010 --> 01:33:19,630
which is a bummer. But uh, be back on
the path today. As a matter of fact,

1588
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:23,320
well, technically you're on the path.
Your path is just super white. You know,

1589
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:26,800
you had to switch lanes for a little bit.
You don't miss it, you miss the exit,

1590
01:33:26,801 --> 01:33:30,520
but you know, boom, you're back on
in that lane in on the same path.

1591
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:34,510
And we're looking at, we're looking at
spring publication for that. Once again,

1592
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:38,320
get it out there.
I'm really having fun writing this book.

1593
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:43,150
That's the characters develop more
complex, complex, or some complexities.

1594
01:33:43,151 --> 01:33:46,120
There's some situations that mark
hasn't really had to deal with yet.

1595
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:49,270
The primary being Danny Reinhardt.

1596
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:54,880
So brace yourself for the impact of Danny
Reinhart. Praise yourself. All right,

1597
01:33:55,030 --> 01:33:58,690
next question.
Your lifestyle is intense and intentional.

1598
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:03,910
How do I even get started
living like that? Let's just
break this down real easy.

1599
01:34:03,911 --> 01:34:08,500
Okay. Um, uh, number one, if you want
to live like more focused in your life,

1600
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:13,360
choose to decide that you're going
to actually live like that. Do that.

1601
01:34:14,500 --> 01:34:16,390
Write down whatever it is you want to do.

1602
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:19,810
And then before you go to bed at night,

1603
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,000
write down some things
that you can do tomorrow.

1604
01:34:22,001 --> 01:34:26,080
They're going to help you move towards
the goals that you have and then set your

1605
01:34:26,081 --> 01:34:29,530
alarm clock for early in the morning,
wake up and do the things you wrote down.

1606
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,160
Stay on that path. That's it. Yeah.

1607
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:39,580
And do you think that you've just sort
of grown accustomed to just dealing with

1608
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:42,940
it? That was, you know, the more
you do it. Yeah, absolutely.

1609
01:34:42,941 --> 01:34:45,490
So that's Kinda the hard part,
right? To get off the ground.

1610
01:34:45,670 --> 01:34:50,620
She was saying to break the gravitational
pull of, of laziness and apathy.

1611
01:34:50,650 --> 01:34:53,110
Yes. Yeah. And of course that,

1612
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:57,980
but I feel like that in
this kind of situation, like
when you live, how intently

1613
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,770
intense. Sure. But you kind
of always been intense.

1614
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:05,450
But that intentional situation cause
it's pretty easy if you know a goal,

1615
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:07,160
it's pretty,
I won't say easy,

1616
01:35:07,161 --> 01:35:10,220
but it's simple like to reach that
goal is really clear. You know,

1617
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:13,070
like you're going to have to fight
through obstacles, all this other stuff.

1618
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:15,410
But if you don't really have
an intentional like goal,

1619
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,040
it's hard to just kind of float there
and be like, I need to be, I dunno,

1620
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:21,050
vaguely successful.
It's like it's,

1621
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:26,120
it makes the whole deal harder and it's
a lot of times like a normal person

1622
01:35:26,210 --> 01:35:30,830
would, they don't have specific goals
for every aspect of their life. You know,

1623
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:34,160
they'll have one in maybe
with their career or something
like that or fitness or

1624
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,080
something like that. But everything
else is just sort of, hey,

1625
01:35:36,081 --> 01:35:39,380
I'm living day by day doing the best
I can kind of thing. But if you can,

1626
01:35:39,381 --> 01:35:40,970
whether it be write it down and whatever,

1627
01:35:40,971 --> 01:35:43,310
if you can have it in your
brain consciously that,

1628
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,630
or remember essentially like what these
goals are, it makes it a lot more clear.

1629
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:50,390
And then the more you kind
of follow those goals,

1630
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:55,610
the more it becomes like a
habit. Like you, it's what I
think. Check. Next question.

1631
01:35:56,810 --> 01:36:01,760
How do the finest civilian leaders differ
from the finest military leaders or in

1632
01:36:01,761 --> 01:36:02,241
other words,

1633
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:07,241
what character traits do military leaders
to develop that are more difficult,

1634
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,420
are rare for, uh, for
civilian leaders to develop.

1635
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,370
They're really,

1636
01:36:12,371 --> 01:36:15,820
the leadership is leadership and the
good civilian leaders have the same good

1637
01:36:15,821 --> 01:36:19,150
qualities that the good military
leaders have. And vice versa.

1638
01:36:19,660 --> 01:36:23,890
And Lafe Lafe was talking about this
the other day that, you know, he,

1639
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,100
he tells people like, Hey man, I wish
you were in the military, was your,

1640
01:36:27,130 --> 01:36:29,860
you would have been good. You know, you
would have been a good infantry officer.

1641
01:36:29,861 --> 01:36:31,360
You'd have a good seal platoon leader.

1642
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:34,360
That would have been cool if you were in
the teams because you're a good leader

1643
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:35,860
in the civilian sector.
You're a good leader in the,

1644
01:36:35,861 --> 01:36:38,530
you'd be a good leader in the military.
So there's no,

1645
01:36:39,240 --> 01:36:43,930
and now there are strengths and
weaknesses for leaders in both of those

1646
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:47,800
situations. In milk, there's military
leaders. You take 10 military leaders,

1647
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:50,950
there's all kinds of strengths
and weaknesses different
between all each one of

1648
01:36:50,951 --> 01:36:52,300
those 10 and there's all kinds of,

1649
01:36:52,301 --> 01:36:54,400
you take 10 civilian leaders and just
all kinds of different strengths and

1650
01:36:54,401 --> 01:36:59,140
weaknesses amongst those 10 and if you
put them, if you flip them back and forth,

1651
01:36:59,141 --> 01:37:01,750
it doesn't matter if they're still going
to be random strengths and weaknesses.

1652
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:03,460
Some guys are good at
present presenting things.

1653
01:37:03,461 --> 01:37:04,780
Some guys are good at simplifying things,

1654
01:37:04,781 --> 01:37:06,970
some guys are good at
articulating things and,

1655
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:09,820
and those groups wash out regardless.

1656
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:11,890
There's great military leaders
that aren't very articulate,

1657
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,990
but they figured out a way to get done.

1658
01:37:13,991 --> 01:37:16,000
There's great a civilian leaders
that aren't very articulate,

1659
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:16,834
but they figured out a way.

1660
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,770
There's great military leaders that
are really good at simplifying things.

1661
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:22,420
There's great civilian leaders
that are good at simple.

1662
01:37:22,421 --> 01:37:25,960
There's the people that are not good at
that, so they find the correct solution,

1663
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:28,870
the people that will compliment
them as leaders and move forward,

1664
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:33,130
but no huge difference. Actually. There's
no, there's no difference. There's,

1665
01:37:33,190 --> 01:37:38,050
there's just, there's good leadership and
there's bad leadership. Yeah, that's it.

1666
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:42,680
Hey Jocko,
love your books and podcasts.

1667
01:37:42,820 --> 01:37:46,940
When it comes down to the wire and
you need to make a quick and tactical

1668
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:50,540
decision and Mitt amidst chaos,
how do you keep your head straight?

1669
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:54,000
This is just everyone knows the answer to
this. By now, detach, take a step back,

1670
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:55,980
take a step back off the line,
a step back from the

1671
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,340
tactical situation that's going
on. Turn your head, look around,

1672
01:37:59,341 --> 01:38:03,030
see what's going on, assess it properly
unemotionally and then make a decision.

1673
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,040
That's it.
You got to learn to detach

1674
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:12,240
easily. Money. Next question,
John. It's not easy. It was easy.

1675
01:38:12,450 --> 01:38:15,840
People would ask me that question
12 times a day. It is simple.

1676
01:38:15,841 --> 01:38:20,010
It is simple but it's definitely not
easy. No it's not. And I'll tell you,

1677
01:38:21,450 --> 01:38:23,070
it's not only not easy,

1678
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:27,600
it's almost so hard that you
don't even like see it happening.

1679
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:30,330
It's like you're blind to it.
Most people are blind to it.

1680
01:38:30,331 --> 01:38:33,210
That's why it's such a huge advantage
from a leadership perspective.

1681
01:38:33,290 --> 01:38:36,870
You can be one inch above everyone else.

1682
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:41,610
You can see infinitely further than
they can cause. Cause let's face it,

1683
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:44,520
they have a limited when when you're,

1684
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,760
when you're at one level
and when you're at six feet,

1685
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:52,800
you can see what you can see.
You go to eight feet,

1686
01:38:53,070 --> 01:38:56,760
you can see things that they can't see.
They've literally can't see them.

1687
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:59,040
So therefore you know,

1688
01:38:59,041 --> 01:39:02,400
things that they don't know and all of
a sudden you seem brilliant because you

1689
01:39:02,401 --> 01:39:06,540
can literally see things that they
literally can't see. So take a step back,

1690
01:39:06,570 --> 01:39:11,340
turn your head, look around, detached from
your emotions, detached from the chaos.

1691
01:39:11,490 --> 01:39:13,530
That's it.
And the emotions.

1692
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:18,660
That's like one of the major
things that's making you blind.

1693
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:23,850
The for sure. Yeah. Whether it's
emotions, whether it's anger,

1694
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,170
whether it's frustration, whether
it's panic, whether it's um,

1695
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,153
stress.

1696
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,450
All those emotions will do have the same
result on you and your decision making,

1697
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:38,250
which is you won't see what's actually
happening. Yeah. Do y'all call,

1698
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:43,770
how do you build a relationship with a
boss that consistently loses his temper

1699
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:48,750
on a regular basis? Stay
calm, don't overreact.

1700
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:54,170
Let them vent to you and don't make a
big deal out of them losing their temper

1701
01:39:55,110 --> 01:39:59,200
to just be this, be like, oh,
just absorb it and be like,
hey, it's all good. Boston.

1702
01:39:59,201 --> 01:40:02,730
Yup. You know, let them vent and then
when they calm down a little bit,

1703
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:06,490
you don't just don't even don't go like,
man, I'm glad you calm down. No, just,

1704
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:11,280
you know, say, okay, Hey, here's where
we're at with this decision. You know,

1705
01:40:11,290 --> 01:40:14,520
I'm going to bring this to the troops or
whatever, you know, just, just be calm.

1706
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:15,880
And then eventually a,

1707
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:19,440
hopefully you get a relationship that's
strong enough that you can actually say

1708
01:40:19,441 --> 01:40:23,100
something to him like, hey
man, you know, I know you,

1709
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:26,370
I know things drive you
crazy, but you know, it's you,

1710
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:30,780
it's always a lot better when you're just
kind of calm and everyone kind of has

1711
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:33,270
a lot of respect for
that, you know? But again,

1712
01:40:33,271 --> 01:40:35,070
that's when you got to be careful with,
because they might just go,

1713
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:36,690
what are you talking about,
you or know about respect.

1714
01:40:36,691 --> 01:40:39,480
They might lose their
separate right there. So yeah,

1715
01:40:39,570 --> 01:40:43,170
I'm just going to be calm and not
overreact to absorb that kind of thing.

1716
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:45,643
And the question,

1717
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:49,740
I'm struggling to be an effective leader
because I'm told that I don't have the

1718
01:40:49,741 --> 01:40:53,920
right tone.
I'm too direct in course

1719
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:58,940
and I'm not too sure how to fix it. I'd
appreciate any and all help. Thanks man.

1720
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:01,980
You can record yourself while
you're talking to people,

1721
01:41:01,981 --> 01:41:05,820
like when you're on the phone with someone
just recorded to take out your, your,

1722
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:09,300
your cell phone and record
and see what you sound like.

1723
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:11,220
Cause you might be surprised
at what you sound like.

1724
01:41:11,790 --> 01:41:14,490
A lot of times people don't
realize what they sound like. Um,

1725
01:41:14,790 --> 01:41:18,900
you might have to overcompensate for a
little while and be like overly pleasant

1726
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:22,740
and nice to people, which, which
to them might sound like normal,

1727
01:41:22,741 --> 01:41:27,000
but to you it'll sound like you're
being just totally over the top. Nice.

1728
01:41:27,001 --> 01:41:29,490
Because you're like,
how are you today?

1729
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:32,640
And they're thinking, oh, that's nice.

1730
01:41:32,641 --> 01:41:35,130
He's actually having a conversation
with me and knew your mind. You like,

1731
01:41:35,131 --> 01:41:38,010
these are just pleasantries I don't think
I should be doing. You know, it's like,

1732
01:41:38,011 --> 01:41:40,890
no, just calm down. It's
actually great feedback.

1733
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:45,480
It's awesome that people have actually
told you that you are too direct and too

1734
01:41:45,481 --> 01:41:46,800
course.
So what does that mean?

1735
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:49,530
You're offending people if you're
offending people, do they listen to you?

1736
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:52,290
The answer is no.
So how do you not offend people?

1737
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,760
And in your mind you're thinking,
Hey, this the way I am, you know,

1738
01:41:56,761 --> 01:41:58,730
I'm just one of these people. Let's
direct you. Don't you know, we just,

1739
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:02,460
I just put the word out and it's like, no,
actually all you do is piss people off,

1740
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,560
offend them, and now they don't listen
to you. So don't be that person. Yeah.

1741
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:08,850
Let's try and build relationships.
Make that your key goal.

1742
01:42:08,851 --> 01:42:11,520
Make your goal not to get
your point across to them,

1743
01:42:11,610 --> 01:42:12,780
but to build a relationship with them.

1744
01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:16,740
Make that your goal and then the rest
of it will start to come together.

1745
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,330
Get you moving in the right direction.

1746
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:20,100
Yeah.
And,

1747
01:42:20,940 --> 01:42:24,360
and sometimes I'm not saying
this person is like this,

1748
01:42:24,361 --> 01:42:29,310
but sometimes people who are direct in
course like they sort of take pride in it.

1749
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:33,330
Yeah, for sure. So if you can
search your mind and be like, Hey,

1750
01:42:33,331 --> 01:42:37,170
am I taking pride in this little
bit? Know that like you're, you're,

1751
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:40,700
you're going full speed in the wrong
direction with that, you know, um,

1752
01:42:41,670 --> 01:42:45,720
if that's the case, that makes it a
lot easier. You Go, Yup. Affirmative.

1753
01:42:45,810 --> 01:42:50,460
Next question. I served in the Coast
Guard and operate in high risk.

1754
01:42:50,461 --> 01:42:55,350
Surf up Beration is where not only do
I have victims in the water who gave a

1755
01:42:55,351 --> 01:42:57,870
high risk,
who have high risk of dying,

1756
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:02,340
but also my people and myself have a
high probabilities of being injured or

1757
01:43:02,341 --> 01:43:07,200
killed. I enjoy my job thoroughly and
perform on the job, but it's the waiting.

1758
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:11,700
That's brutal. How do you manage
stress? Stress in the off time.

1759
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:13,740
So it's not overwhelming.

1760
01:43:14,810 --> 01:43:17,510
Look, you got to train hard. You gotta
be prepared. You've got to rehearse,

1761
01:43:17,511 --> 01:43:18,880
you got drill,
worst case scenarios,

1762
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:22,700
you've got to be an awesome physical
condition. You got to do all those things.

1763
01:43:24,170 --> 01:43:26,240
You prepare as much as you can.

1764
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:29,810
You can't worry about things
that you can't control.

1765
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,730
So the things that you can control,
what can you control?

1766
01:43:31,731 --> 01:43:35,000
You can be in good physical shape,
you can prepare for your equipment,

1767
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:36,740
make sure you know how to
operate your equipment.

1768
01:43:36,890 --> 01:43:38,360
You can drill worst case scenarios too.

1769
01:43:38,361 --> 01:43:41,570
So make sure your team understands the
procedures that you're supposed to do.

1770
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,540
So you take control of all the
things that you can control.

1771
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:49,550
You do those to the nth degree.
The things that you can't control you,

1772
01:43:49,551 --> 01:43:54,230
you just got to not worry about them
because that's what's, you're actually,

1773
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,960
you're actually less prepared because
you're worrying about other things.

1774
01:43:56,961 --> 01:43:59,200
You can't sleep because there's a storm
coming and you know that there's gonna

1775
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:02,390
be some rescues. It's like, Hey,
you've prepared, you've trained,

1776
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:05,750
you've got your equipment already. You've,
you've rehearsed with your teammates.

1777
01:44:05,930 --> 01:44:07,130
Like that's what we do.

1778
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:10,850
And there's some things that I can't
control and I'm okay with that.

1779
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:13,850
And not to get too crazy,

1780
01:44:13,851 --> 01:44:18,851
but like worst case scenario and not to
get too like dark worst case scenario,

1781
01:44:19,671 --> 01:44:24,500
what happens? Worst case
scenario, what happens? You Die.

1782
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:29,270
That's the worst case scenario
that happens. Um, okay.

1783
01:44:31,950 --> 01:44:35,670
Okay. So you've got your
insurance taken care of,

1784
01:44:35,671 --> 01:44:38,430
you've got your Sgli set up,
you know,

1785
01:44:38,431 --> 01:44:43,431
you've written letters to your family
to tell them what to do and that you've

1786
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:47,910
had a great job and that you love what
you're doing, what you're doing and,

1787
01:44:48,570 --> 01:44:52,110
and that that's the way it goes.
You know,

1788
01:44:52,111 --> 01:44:55,170
part of life is death a hundred percent.

1789
01:44:56,010 --> 01:45:00,600
Think about that all a hundred percent.
So if you can

1790
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:05,670
compartmentalize the, the things
that you can control and say, okay,

1791
01:45:05,671 --> 01:45:06,810
these are the things I've got control of.

1792
01:45:06,811 --> 01:45:09,420
And then you look at the
worst case scenario, which
is the worst case scenario.

1793
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:11,520
I mean, I guess the worst
case scenario is like, hey,

1794
01:45:11,521 --> 01:45:15,210
if you could one of your
teammates, you know, dies. That's,

1795
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:19,440
that seems to me to always be the
worst thing. Or You die. Well,

1796
01:45:19,441 --> 01:45:23,250
what are you going to do so well
to prevent my teammate from dying?

1797
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,100
I'm going to train, prepare, do
everything I can in my power.

1798
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,870
And one of the things in my power to
do is to not be scared of things that I

1799
01:45:30,871 --> 01:45:32,250
can't control or not worried about.

1800
01:45:32,251 --> 01:45:36,900
Things that I can't control and then like,

1801
01:45:36,901 --> 01:45:40,800
Hey, I could die doing this
job. That could happen,

1802
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:46,230
but do you do about that? You prepare
for it. You, you write your, will,

1803
01:45:46,231 --> 01:45:50,070
you make sure that your w your w two or
page two I believe it's called your page

1804
01:45:50,071 --> 01:45:53,310
two in the military service records
so that they know what to do with your

1805
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:58,020
finances. You fill out
your Sgli form, you write,

1806
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,150
you write a letter to your fans,
friends and family.

1807
01:46:01,410 --> 01:46:05,640
That's what you do and then
you go out and you do your job.

1808
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:10,230
The fear,
the fear of death

1809
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:16,320
that you have in your mind is
more likely to cause a problem.

1810
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:19,080
It's more you will have more.
If you're afraid of death,

1811
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:22,020
you're more likely to die than if you
say, you know what? If this happens,

1812
01:46:22,650 --> 01:46:24,240
God forbid,
guess what?

1813
01:46:25,140 --> 01:46:29,370
I'm living the life I want to live
and I'll, I'm going to die doing this.

1814
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,550
It's like that. If you can get
over that hurdle right there,

1815
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:37,020
that's a huge thing and the more
comfortable you are with that,

1816
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:42,060
the less chance of you
actually dying there is because
you won't be scared of it.

1817
01:46:42,061 --> 01:46:46,290
You won't be hesitant. You
won't be paranoid, you won't
lose sleep. You'll be like,

1818
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:51,210
okay, so, so just truly
think it like, man, you're,

1819
01:46:51,270 --> 01:46:55,260
you're doing an important job. You're
going to try and save people's lives.

1820
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:56,700
There's inherent risk in that,

1821
01:46:56,790 --> 01:46:59,490
but it's what you want to do
is what you chose to do theirs.

1822
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,300
You deal with that and if
you can get through that,

1823
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:06,290
that's a huge step. Does this
mean you want to die? No,

1824
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,250
it doesn't mean that at all.
It doesn't mean that at all.

1825
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:13,260
It doesn't mean that at all, but if
you're like, you know what, I could die.

1826
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:16,980
That's one of the possible outcomes here.
It's highly unlikely,

1827
01:47:17,010 --> 01:47:20,100
but it is a possible outcome.
If it happens,

1828
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:23,400
I've lived the best possible way I can.

1829
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:29,240
I've prepared for my family friends
to be taken care of to understand what

1830
01:47:29,281 --> 01:47:33,780
happened and I'm, I'm okay with that.
That's, that's my recommendation.

1831
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:43,520
Daca.
I'm a very goal oriented.

1832
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:46,700
I'm very goal oriented.

1833
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:50,690
My friends say that they want me to
achieve this and that yet they still are

1834
01:47:50,691 --> 01:47:54,530
vaping, partying, being lazy
and overall don't walk the talk.

1835
01:47:55,550 --> 01:48:00,200
I want to be an ATF. Special
tactics, air force, Air Force,

1836
01:48:00,201 --> 01:48:03,530
special tactics officer and I don't
have time for those destruction.

1837
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:05,750
How do I get them on track?

1838
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:08,720
Well this is pretty straight
forward one for me. Um,

1839
01:48:09,620 --> 01:48:14,620
what I do is I walk the walk and keep
walking and if these guys want to walk the

1840
01:48:16,611 --> 01:48:18,140
walk with me,
I'm cool.

1841
01:48:18,590 --> 01:48:22,760
But if they want to vape
and party and be lazy,

1842
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:27,950
um, those aren't the kind of guys you
want to round with your team anyways,

1843
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:32,980
you know? So unless they get on the
path that leads to the right place, did,

1844
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:35,360
I mean you can tell him, hey man,
this isn't going to get you there,

1845
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:39,320
but don't spend a bunch of time trying
to pick up and drag people that don't

1846
01:48:39,321 --> 01:48:40,400
want to drag themselves.

1847
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:44,780
Not that you go into an organization
like a special tactics in the air force.

1848
01:48:45,170 --> 01:48:46,760
You don't want to be
carrying other people.

1849
01:48:46,761 --> 01:48:49,490
You don't have to motivate other people.

1850
01:48:49,491 --> 01:48:52,550
You want people that want
to do the job themselves.

1851
01:48:53,240 --> 01:48:58,240
So don't spend a bunch of time with
these people that don't want to get after

1852
01:48:58,401 --> 01:48:59,234
it.

1853
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:02,193
Makes Sense

1854
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,130
Jocko,

1855
01:49:04,130 --> 01:49:07,460
when things start moving fast and feel
out of control because you're really

1856
01:49:07,461 --> 01:49:11,330
getting after it, work, family do
you do to and countless other things.

1857
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:16,750
How do you slow it down and get the
feeling back of being in control?

1858
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:21,620
What you do in this situation is go
harder. You go harder. What you do is,

1859
01:49:21,621 --> 01:49:24,020
and this is, think of it like
this, think of it as a sprint.

1860
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:27,050
You're getting bogged down,
there's a bunch of stuff going on.

1861
01:49:27,230 --> 01:49:31,010
Grab a hold of a bunch of them
and sprint and get caught up.

1862
01:49:31,910 --> 01:49:35,270
That's what you do. You
sprint, you get caught up. Um,

1863
01:49:36,410 --> 01:49:40,010
I do that kind of right now
and I didn't start doing that.

1864
01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:43,550
I really started having to do these
little sprints that I do sometimes now,

1865
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:49,390
like maybe a year ago where I just have
to just just buckle down for three days

1866
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:55,060
and do nothing but work just that's
it. Nothing but work. Hmm. I'm,

1867
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:58,840
I'm in the middle of one right now.
Like just what,

1868
01:49:58,870 --> 01:50:02,290
what I did over the last few days. It's
like I was like work, work and more work.

1869
01:50:03,130 --> 01:50:06,940
So it's a sprint but
then you get caught up,

1870
01:50:06,941 --> 01:50:09,250
you get things under
control and then you can,

1871
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:12,730
you can go back to a more sustainable
pace cause you can't sprint forever.

1872
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:18,970
You cannot sprint forever factually.
Right. That doesn't work. Yeah.

1873
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:23,050
So if you think you're going
to run alongside of vehicle,

1874
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:26,050
because you can sprint,
that's not going to work.

1875
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:28,300
Eventually the vehicle is going to
outpace you and you're going to be left

1876
01:50:28,301 --> 01:50:32,380
behind. So you have to, you have
to choose a race that you can win.

1877
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,860
But sometimes just like in a running race,

1878
01:50:36,430 --> 01:50:41,350
you got to sprint to get ahead. And then
once you get ahead you can, you know,

1879
01:50:41,380 --> 01:50:46,270
you can fall, you can, you can go back
to a sustainable base, but that's,

1880
01:50:46,300 --> 01:50:49,300
that's what I do. I go into like a
little period of mass production.

1881
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,840
I prefer slow and steady.
Absolutely.

1882
01:50:53,110 --> 01:50:58,110
I prefer just to keep on the disciplined
path every day doing what needs to be

1883
01:50:59,411 --> 01:51:03,820
done. You know that we talked
about plant and the tree earlier,

1884
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:07,030
like writing a book.
Nothing feels better writing a book.

1885
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:08,950
Then when you look up after,

1886
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:13,390
after a month of writing and you've
got 30,000 words because you wrote a

1887
01:51:13,390 --> 01:51:14,223
thousand words a day,

1888
01:51:14,710 --> 01:51:18,470
to sit down and write
30,000 words is a gut check.

1889
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,110
It's a gut check.

1890
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:25,350
For me it is because I don't enjoy
doing that for long periods of time.

1891
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:29,860
I don't enjoy sitting there typing because
the boards are already pretty much in

1892
01:51:29,861 --> 01:51:32,110
my head,
so it's just a manual labor,

1893
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:35,440
but it's not manual labor
where you get to move rocks.

1894
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:39,310
It's a manual later of pecking going
into a keyboard. That's not fun for me.

1895
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:42,550
There's no,
there's zero physical benefit,

1896
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:47,380
but to look up after a month and say,
I've got 30,000 words,

1897
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:50,340
that's almost a book, right? Yeah.

1898
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:53,440
So I prefer to do that,

1899
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:58,830
but sometimes because I've saddled myself
with many different things going on

1900
01:52:00,641 --> 01:52:05,200
right now, sometimes I get
behind and I have to sprint.
You have to just say, okay,

1901
01:52:05,201 --> 01:52:07,270
you know what,
this is going to suck for three days,

1902
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:09,970
but I'm gonna get back
on track and here we go.

1903
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:12,880
So that's what I do when I started feeling
like other things are kind of getting

1904
01:52:12,881 --> 01:52:16,780
the hang me, like, hey man,
maybe you have to for work,

1905
01:52:16,781 --> 01:52:21,400
you have to sacrifice Jujitsu for
whatever, two days. You're like, Yup,

1906
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:23,040
I'm not going to train, but um, that's,

1907
01:52:23,050 --> 01:52:26,560
it's going to save me a total of five
hours in the next couple of days and I can

1908
01:52:26,561 --> 01:52:30,490
get a lot of work done in five hours.
I didn't do Jujitsu yesterday.

1909
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:37,090
Did I want to? Yes, I did. But I said,
okay, I'm going to sprint right now.

1910
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:41,260
I gotta get this other stuff done.
And I had to prioritize. So that's,

1911
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:43,690
that's what you have to do.
And guess what you know?

1912
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:46,490
Then you get through that sprint. Now you
can go back to your sustainable thing,

1913
01:52:46,491 --> 01:52:50,240
which is Jujitsu every day. Just work
out every day, which is, you know, right.

1914
01:52:50,241 --> 01:52:54,590
You're right every day. Do your
work every day. So try that.

1915
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:57,080
Try just buckling out.
Tell your family,

1916
01:52:58,070 --> 01:53:01,370
tell your Jujitsu instructor
and be like, Hey, listen,

1917
01:53:01,400 --> 01:53:04,160
I'm gonna be gone for three days.
I got, I got to get caught up.

1918
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:09,320
So standby at, boom. Tell
your family, look, Hey,

1919
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:10,880
I'm sorry for the next three days.

1920
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,570
You're not going to hear much from
me because I'm a stay at work late.

1921
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:17,660
I'm going to get a bunch of stuff done
and just sprint hard and give them a

1922
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:18,710
little reward at the end.
Hey,

1923
01:53:18,711 --> 01:53:21,020
when I get back on Tuesday or
when I get back on the Friday,

1924
01:53:21,021 --> 01:53:22,340
we're going to go out for dinner.
We don't have a good time,

1925
01:53:23,180 --> 01:53:25,400
but I've got to sprint. We've got
to get caught up. So there you go.

1926
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:30,480
That's my procedure. Good little tactic
or, yeah, he's a good tactic. Oh,

1927
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:31,790
a little reward.
You like that

1928
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,300
the will of the whole deal?
Both of them.

1929
01:53:33,301 --> 01:53:36,690
Like basically to make sure that you
communicate with all these people that

1930
01:53:36,691 --> 01:53:39,870
might be affected by your thing. Even
like in small ways like how you say, Hey,

1931
01:53:39,871 --> 01:53:41,850
I'm going to sprint right now.
You'd be,

1932
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
oh well I'm sometimes surprised on how
that just that little thing is sole

1933
01:53:47,431 --> 01:53:49,910
effective. Like you
know, like I don't know,

1934
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:54,960
I'm going to go to Jujitsu at do weird
different time that maybe my family sort

1935
01:53:55,031 --> 01:53:55,890
of depending on me,

1936
01:53:55,891 --> 01:53:58,590
not in a big way but just a little bit
depending on me being there. Right.

1937
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:02,970
And I'm going to go to juice instead if
I say a one week before I do that and if

1938
01:54:02,971 --> 01:54:07,650
I say, hey, on this day, you know, like
I understand, hey, usually I'm here,

1939
01:54:07,651 --> 01:54:08,461
I dig it,
but hey,

1940
01:54:08,461 --> 01:54:11,280
I'm going to go this day of this training
just kind of means a lot to me this

1941
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:15,690
day and time, whatever. A
week before heads up. They
love it, love night into him,

1942
01:54:15,850 --> 01:54:19,560
tried to do it the hour
before versus the week before,

1943
01:54:19,561 --> 01:54:24,000
night and day one situation.
It's like yes, oh we got
your back, what we'll do it.

1944
01:54:24,480 --> 01:54:27,870
And the other one is like disdain.
Guess what?

1945
01:54:27,871 --> 01:54:32,871
My wife thinks what she thinks I'm going
to Jiu Jitsu every day and I am just

1946
01:54:33,401 --> 01:54:34,980
like,
so I'm sure at some point

1947
01:54:35,340 --> 01:54:38,880
to her if I'm ever like, oh
you know, she'll be like,

1948
01:54:38,910 --> 01:54:42,820
oh you didn't leave yet. I'm like, no, I'm
actually working. It's, she'll be like,

1949
01:54:42,850 --> 01:54:45,270
oh okay. That's what she
realized. I got some work to do,

1950
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:49,200
Matt not, but that's a good tip.
That's good to remember it, you know,

1951
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:53,610
cause it's easy to get caught up in
like hey this is me and my sprint.

1952
01:54:53,790 --> 01:54:56,580
I'm the one going to have to buckle
down, you know, sort of thing.

1953
01:54:56,581 --> 01:54:59,910
So it kind of maybe gets in
the way of you thinking like,

1954
01:54:59,911 --> 01:55:02,220
hey it's for other people too.
You know what I'm saying?

1955
01:55:02,640 --> 01:55:05,610
And then that that additional one where
it's I can when I'm done and you've got

1956
01:55:05,611 --> 01:55:09,200
another reward. Cause then
if you communicate they don't
need the reward. I mean,

1957
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:12,240
you know, it depends on who
it is, but typically it would,

1958
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:15,920
it would make sense for them not to
need the reward because we're all good

1959
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,770
scenario. Don't do it
too much. They expect it,

1960
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:22,880
but that's a good to, I think
that's good. I'm going to,

1961
01:55:22,890 --> 01:55:27,210
I'm going to put down into
rotation. Next question. Hey Jocko,

1962
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,310
a lot of respect for you and your work.
I have a question.

1963
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:34,430
How do you draw the line between doing
things you're uncomfortable with to

1964
01:55:34,801 --> 01:55:38,460
develop and just torturing
yourself unnecessarily?

1965
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:40,361
Who's pretty?

1966
01:55:40,361 --> 01:55:42,690
It's pretty straight forward question
actually in a pretty straightforward

1967
01:55:42,730 --> 01:55:47,100
answer. Does it benefit you
or not? Does it benefit you?

1968
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:47,910
And,

1969
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:52,710
and there is some level of torture that
benefits you because it just keeps you

1970
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,900
mentally and physically tougher.

1971
01:55:55,740 --> 01:56:00,740
So there is benefit to
to some level of torture,

1972
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:01,650
right?

1973
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:06,540
There's also a level of torture that
is not beneficial for you. Actually.

1974
01:56:06,541 --> 01:56:09,060
It takes you backwards and
it's going to injure you.

1975
01:56:09,061 --> 01:56:11,610
It's going to break you down,
it's going to break you down mentally.

1976
01:56:11,611 --> 01:56:12,600
It's going to break you down physically.

1977
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,460
There's times like I've talked about this,

1978
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:17,400
like there's times when I've gotten
on a plane where I get on a plane,

1979
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:21,600
this is what I know. I'm just done
training, which is I get on a plane and I,

1980
01:56:21,870 --> 01:56:24,810
cause normally on a plane I can
like really hammer out some work.

1981
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:27,480
I can get a podcast,
I can read a book.

1982
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:29,790
I could just really go
hard because there's no,

1983
01:56:29,791 --> 01:56:33,330
I don't sign up for Wifi on the planes.
I just do work.

1984
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:38,340
And um, when I get on a
plane and I'm just like, Ugh,

1985
01:56:38,820 --> 01:56:41,610
I'm going to watch him,
I'm going to go into this thing and watch.

1986
01:56:41,910 --> 01:56:45,010
And I remember the last time I did,
I watched zoo lander. Yeah man.

1987
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:46,680
Which is a funny movie,

1988
01:56:47,160 --> 01:56:52,160
but there's No v zero positive benefit
to my humanity by watching Zealander.

1989
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:56,790
But that's, that's it. So,

1990
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,800
so I just like, okay, mentally
need to dam break, you know.

1991
01:57:02,700 --> 01:57:04,680
And same thing with physical,

1992
01:57:04,681 --> 01:57:07,380
like there's times where you're
physically like there's times,

1993
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:11,160
this is interesting one,
when you're training Jujitsu,

1994
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:16,340
if I have an injury that's recovering
and let's say normally I do eight rounds,

1995
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:20,220
10 rounds,
when I have an injury that's recovering,

1996
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:24,270
I have to have the discipline to say,
you know what,

1997
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:29,160
I'm only doing four rounds today because
when you get to the fifth, six round,

1998
01:57:29,490 --> 01:57:33,030
I'm tired. I'm making mistakes.
Seventh, eighth round,

1999
01:57:33,031 --> 01:57:34,860
now I'm actually going
to get injured again,

2000
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:39,780
so I want to recover from the
injury, so I take some, I take law.

2001
01:57:39,810 --> 01:57:44,810
I have to have the discipline to say no
because the lack of discipline says I'm

2002
01:57:44,821 --> 01:57:48,540
just going to train more obscure to train
harder and sometimes you have to take

2003
01:57:48,541 --> 01:57:49,110
a little,

2004
01:57:49,110 --> 01:57:53,610
a little bit of a breather
and so if you're doing
something that's uncomfortable

2005
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:57,300
but it's making you stronger or
smarter or faster, yeah, that's good.

2006
01:57:57,930 --> 01:58:02,930
If you're doing something
that's uncomfortable and
it's not beneficial to you,

2007
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:08,160
then that's not smart to do except for
the occasional gut check, which is, hey,

2008
01:58:08,161 --> 01:58:09,300
this is just going to suck.

2009
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:13,520
I mean this is just going to suck
and I'm going to do it anyways. Yeah.

2010
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:14,693
And that's fine.

2011
01:58:18,940 --> 01:58:23,080
You're kind of different than people
in with the concept that you're talking

2012
01:58:23,081 --> 01:58:26,140
about it. I think. Yeah, that's
universal with just good, like, you know,

2013
01:58:26,141 --> 01:58:29,830
you talk about like going on the plane,
right? Even like the way you're like,

2014
01:58:29,831 --> 01:58:32,110
that is no good for humanity.
Well you know,

2015
01:58:32,111 --> 01:58:34,060
I know that was like a
joking way of putting it,

2016
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:39,510
but the thing is that is good for
you and it's what is their lender,

2017
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,070
zoo lander,
whatever you or something that

2018
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,980
that's like not work cause it's like,
you know, compared to a workout,

2019
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:48,040
Rob Jones does this a lot. He'll compare
it to like lifting weights or workout,

2020
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:52,720
which is good. I think I put near
perfect analogy, the working out thing,

2021
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:56,470
it's, it's essentially just your
rest between sets. That's all it is.

2022
01:58:56,650 --> 01:58:59,800
So if it's like, yeah, you don't
get rest between sets. Oh yeah.

2023
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:02,920
See how much weight you can lift
then probably not that much.

2024
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:06,400
But there's a difference between resting
for like two minutes between your sets

2025
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:11,080
and then resting one day. Yeah,
I agree. Sometimes though,

2026
01:59:11,950 --> 01:59:16,180
sometimes you can say, oh, I need a rest,
but you don't really know what I mean.

2027
01:59:16,181 --> 01:59:19,000
Yeah. You gotta be careful of
that. Sometimes you got to go, oh,

2028
01:59:19,001 --> 01:59:20,770
this is just torture Straw.
I don't want to do it.

2029
01:59:20,771 --> 01:59:24,130
But you're really just being mentally
weak. Right. So you have to be aware.

2030
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:27,170
You have to do things that
suck sometimes. Yeah, for sure.

2031
01:59:27,520 --> 01:59:31,720
Some workouts just suck and
they're awful and their torture,

2032
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:35,350
but they make you stronger, they make you
better, and they make you tougher. Yeah.

2033
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:40,390
So you do them. Yeah. So it
perfect in the, if you want
to do the workout analogy,

2034
01:59:40,391 --> 01:59:44,680
right, where you're like, okay, so there's
those, those two dichotomies, if you will.

2035
01:59:44,890 --> 01:59:48,610
So it's like, okay, rest between
sets. Cool. I dig it. You do work,

2036
01:59:48,611 --> 01:59:52,330
and then you rest between sets.
That's the whole thing, right. Format.

2037
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:54,180
But you're like, okay, I,

2038
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:58,600
if I need two minutes of rest in between
my sets for this specific workout for

2039
01:59:58,601 --> 02:00:01,600
this specific outcome or results
from the workout, then boom.

2040
02:00:01,601 --> 02:00:03,310
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna rest for two minutes.

2041
02:00:03,910 --> 02:00:05,380
So there's differences in that case,

2042
02:00:05,381 --> 02:00:07,900
there's a difference between
rescuing two minutes and then rescue,

2043
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:12,010
resting 15 minutes. You don't need all
that rest. Now you're just cruising.

2044
02:00:12,070 --> 02:00:15,850
Now you're just avoiding the next set
or putting it off or doing whatever.

2045
02:00:16,060 --> 02:00:18,580
There's a difference.
But on the other side,

2046
02:00:18,581 --> 02:00:19,810
the more extreme side of the spectrum,

2047
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,450
the workout can be like not two
minutes rest of the workout.

2048
02:00:22,451 --> 02:00:25,150
The whole workout could last two
hours long. No rest between sets.

2049
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:27,970
That's the workout.
But when the workout's done,

2050
02:00:27,971 --> 02:00:30,280
you still got to rest and
recover from that workout.

2051
02:00:30,730 --> 02:00:34,720
So just cause you don't have a set
amount of sets in in your work day to day

2052
02:00:35,200 --> 02:00:38,530
still doesn't mean you need that rest
between sets or at the very least rest

2053
02:00:38,531 --> 02:00:40,810
between work. And one thing that
I got used to in the military,

2054
02:00:40,811 --> 02:00:44,440
and I see it in companies all the time,
like I could work 24 hours a day,

2055
02:00:44,441 --> 02:00:47,800
seven days a week and never stop
and never get everything done. Yeah.

2056
02:00:47,830 --> 02:00:50,860
That's something to think about. So
then you have to say to yourself, well,

2057
02:00:50,861 --> 02:00:53,740
how productive I going to be and what's
important and what's not important.

2058
02:00:53,860 --> 02:00:57,520
And you got to make sure that you get,
you're right. If you take no rest,

2059
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:01,660
you won't be able to function properly.
And for me,

2060
02:01:01,661 --> 02:01:06,190
like I could write 24 hours a day and
not write all the books I want to write.

2061
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:09,460
I could do Jujitsu 24 hours a day
and not get as good as I want to get.

2062
02:01:09,490 --> 02:01:11,440
I could work out 24 hours a day and
not get as strong as I want to get.

2063
02:01:11,650 --> 02:01:15,070
So you have to figure out how to balance
all those different items together to

2064
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:16,420
figure out like,
okay,

2065
02:01:16,421 --> 02:01:20,080
what is an acceptable level at
each one of these components? Yeah.

2066
02:01:20,320 --> 02:01:23,620
And it's going to take kind of identifying
the results that you want that are

2067
02:01:23,621 --> 02:01:28,420
acceptable to you. You know?
So, yeah, like a little, what
do you call it? You know,

2068
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:29,980
like Nascar, right? Right.

2069
02:01:30,410 --> 02:01:35,020
If watch streets of thunder on another
one with Tom Cruise that he's a NASCAR

2070
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:39,010
something offender days
of thunder. Okay. Anyway,

2071
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,580
he's like racing

2072
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:43,820
and he's like, Hey, you
got to do a pit stop.

2073
02:01:44,510 --> 02:01:47,600
Everybody got to do a pit stop.
But it seems weird,

2074
02:01:47,601 --> 02:01:50,420
you know when you're like racing and
you're like, Hey, I'm ahead of everybody.

2075
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:52,760
I'm not going to stop right
now. I'm word, you know.

2076
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:57,260
But I bet your wheels are going to fall
off bell. So you got a pitstop sometimes.

2077
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:59,300
Sure. Watch them, Zoolander, whatever.

2078
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:02,870
And then when you're done you can be way
more productive because those tires are

2079
02:02:02,871 --> 02:02:06,440
new now they can fly or on
the track grip everything.

2080
02:02:06,550 --> 02:02:10,850
So what I'm saying quicker. So that's
part of the game. That's what I'm saying.

2081
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:11,893
Next question.

2082
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:16,970
How does the introduction you gave to
Mike in the equipment room square with

2083
02:02:16,971 --> 02:02:18,930
extreme ownership?
No judgment.

2084
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,041
Oh yeah.

2085
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:23,660
So Mike Cirelli when Mike's really came
into task and your bruiser because his

2086
02:02:23,661 --> 02:02:24,494
other,

2087
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:29,560
his other tasks and it had had some
leadership issues and Mike was sort of the

2088
02:02:30,321 --> 02:02:34,460
collateral damage in that whole thing.
And so they moved him from that task unit,

2089
02:02:34,461 --> 02:02:37,790
which was Task Unit Charlie
into tasking at bruiser.

2090
02:02:38,180 --> 02:02:41,750
And when he came in, I brought him into
the equipment room at seal team three,

2091
02:02:41,751 --> 02:02:46,160
which is where I would counsel my
junior officers because there was,

2092
02:02:46,410 --> 02:02:49,100
there was construction going on at seal
team three at the time and there's no

2093
02:02:49,101 --> 02:02:51,650
ceilings so everyone could
hear you in your office.

2094
02:02:52,550 --> 02:02:56,390
And so I would go into this equipment
room and brief guys if need be.

2095
02:02:56,630 --> 02:02:59,920
And I just brought Mike's Rolling
in there and I had uh, uh,

2096
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:04,670
counseling letter for him to sign and
it said there's no drama in task unit.

2097
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:07,670
Bruiser don't bring any into it.

2098
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:12,740
And that's it. It was like
really straight forward. I don't,

2099
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:14,390
I'd have to ask him if he still has it,

2100
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:18,320
but I don't know why this person thinks
that that doesn't square with the

2101
02:03:18,321 --> 02:03:20,390
extreme ownership as far as I'm concerned.
That is,

2102
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:25,370
I had a guy that was coming into a unit
that had been together for seven or

2103
02:03:25,371 --> 02:03:29,330
eight months, gone through workup and
ready, getting ready for deployment at an,

2104
02:03:29,331 --> 02:03:32,300
I just had to take ownership of the fact
that I had a guy that was showing up

2105
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:35,450
that I didn't know.
I did get feedback,

2106
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,840
I got feedback from multiple people,
multiple sources,

2107
02:03:39,590 --> 02:03:43,940
and my bro source was like,
Hey Sorelli,

2108
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:47,900
he's fucking good to go. And I was like,
okay, cool. So I knew he was good to go,

2109
02:03:47,901 --> 02:03:49,880
but still I wanted to set the,

2110
02:03:50,180 --> 02:03:54,470
the expectation right for him
so that he knew like, like man,

2111
02:03:54,471 --> 02:03:58,280
he might think that that was his
first task. It, he was with, you know,

2112
02:03:58,310 --> 02:04:01,370
he might think this is the way it is.
It's like, no, that's not the way it is.

2113
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:05,300
So for me it was just, hey, we're
just, we're just taking ownership.

2114
02:04:05,640 --> 02:04:07,400
But for me it was, hey, I'm just
gonna take ownership of this,

2115
02:04:07,420 --> 02:04:10,040
make sure he knows what's going on,
make sure we understand the expectations,

2116
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:12,530
make sure that we're not going to have
any drama in here because we don't have

2117
02:04:12,531 --> 02:04:15,530
any drama. There's no drama.
Like, we have problems we solve.

2118
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:20,300
We don't backstab each other and telling
each other and stab each other in the

2119
02:04:20,301 --> 02:04:23,540
back. No, we have a problem.
We get together, we solve the
problem. That's how it is.

2120
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:28,090
And so that's all, you know. No. Uh,
I don't even think that's a, I'm, I'm,

2121
02:04:28,160 --> 02:04:29,480
I'm not even quite sure.

2122
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:34,550
I'd have to get more details
on this question to figure
out why that didn't seem

2123
02:04:34,551 --> 02:04:37,860
like the right thing to do.
From my perspective. It was,

2124
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:40,980
you know, it's great when you, when you
have somebody come on board and they go,

2125
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:44,520
hey man, here's the expectations
that are going on. Boom. Yeah.

2126
02:04:44,521 --> 02:04:47,190
Maybe cause that was
before he did anything.

2127
02:04:47,191 --> 02:04:49,500
It's not like he did something and
then you were like, just showed up.

2128
02:04:49,501 --> 02:04:52,220
You're bringing drama. Don't do that
here. It wasn't that. It was like, man,

2129
02:04:52,290 --> 02:04:55,140
we don't have drama here. Right.
Don't bring any in here. Yeah.

2130
02:04:55,290 --> 02:05:00,090
You're good with that. And Mike's really
said Roger that sir. Yeah. Makes Sense.

2131
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:04,560
Yeah, of course. And you how much
drama he brought in zero. Yeah.

2132
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:09,630
Yeah. So in a way, I mean, I don't
know, looking at it from the outside,

2133
02:05:10,200 --> 02:05:15,130
it seems like that was, you know, the,
the, the essence of extreme ownership,

2134
02:05:15,680 --> 02:05:19,120
some anticipated problems. I'm going
to do everything to mitigate, you know,

2135
02:05:19,121 --> 02:05:19,621
whatever,

2136
02:05:19,621 --> 02:05:24,621
all these things and I'm going to go a
preempted problem solving mode tactfully.

2137
02:05:25,070 --> 02:05:28,200
Yeah. You know, when you're
wearing, you know, in the
locker room or whatever. Yeah.

2138
02:05:28,201 --> 02:05:31,260
It wasn't even like I was like,
you better not,

2139
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:33,450
it didn't even accuse him of
anything you don't punish checks for.

2140
02:05:33,451 --> 02:05:37,290
Literally said there's no drama
here. Yeah. Don't bring any,

2141
02:05:37,470 --> 02:05:41,130
I didn't say like you, we know. You know,
I think I'd like to point my finger now.

2142
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:45,540
It was like, hey man, hey.
Cause in my mind I'm thinking,

2143
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:46,990
you know what I'm thinking in my mind,
hey,

2144
02:05:46,991 --> 02:05:50,610
you got a prior enlisted marine
that's going to be in my task unit.

2145
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:55,390
I got another body and he's an
experienced guy with, you know.

2146
02:05:56,920 --> 02:06:01,290
Yeah. That was, I was, yeah, I was
totally stoked, man. Yeah, yeah.

2147
02:06:02,100 --> 02:06:06,310
No factor. We got time
for one more man. Sure.

2148
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:12,150
How do you stay on the warpath when
everything seems to be going wrong?

2149
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:16,380
Good question. Can you think? That's
a good question. Well, here's,

2150
02:06:16,381 --> 02:06:19,350
here's what I think is
strange about that question.

2151
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:23,180
It's sort of like the question I just
answered about like sprinting. Yeah.

2152
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:29,010
It's easy to, when things are going right,
it's easy to stay on the warpath, right?

2153
02:06:29,011 --> 02:06:32,730
You don't even need to be on the warpath
when things are going great because

2154
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:37,270
everything's happy. There's no war going
on. You're at peace. People are, you know,

2155
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:42,150
delivering food to you and
you're getting a massage. Yeah.

2156
02:06:42,450 --> 02:06:43,980
There's no, there's no,
you're not like, oh,

2157
02:06:43,981 --> 02:06:47,610
I need to be on the warpath right now
while I'm getting a back massage while I'm

2158
02:06:47,611 --> 02:06:50,160
getting food delivered. To
me, that's not happening.

2159
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:56,760
When the actual time that you need to
go on the warpath and you need to go

2160
02:06:56,761 --> 02:07:00,090
harder on the warpath is when
things are going wrong, wrong.

2161
02:07:00,120 --> 02:07:02,550
That's when you need to dig deeper.
That's when you need to,

2162
02:07:03,390 --> 02:07:06,750
that's when the whole
like idea of saying good.

2163
02:07:09,080 --> 02:07:11,300
That's when it happens.
When things are actually,

2164
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:16,250
when you're getting tested by the world,
that's when you want to do it.

2165
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:18,620
So when you get tested by the world,

2166
02:07:18,621 --> 02:07:21,920
that's when you get the opportunity
to show the world what's your made of.

2167
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:28,050
That's where you get to say,
bring it on,

2168
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:32,420
bring it on. Oh, things are
going wrong. Bring it on.

2169
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:34,550
I actually look forward to that.

2170
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:36,830
Yeah,

2171
02:07:36,830 --> 02:07:39,680
because this is when I get
to exercise my discipline.

2172
02:07:39,681 --> 02:07:44,240
This is when I get to show the discipline.
I get to put the discipline to work.

2173
02:07:44,241 --> 02:07:48,410
It's the moment I have been
waiting for because let's face it,

2174
02:07:50,030 --> 02:07:54,620
if things were easy, then I could
just sit around and slack off.

2175
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:58,850
Right. That's what, that's what
could happen. When things are easy,

2176
02:07:58,970 --> 02:08:02,810
when things are going right, that's when
you actually can slack off a little bit.

2177
02:08:02,811 --> 02:08:04,490
Cause things going. Right.
I don't recommend it.

2178
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:07,010
I recommend actually when things
are going right, you go hard.

2179
02:08:07,430 --> 02:08:09,920
But when things are going wrong,
you need to go even harder.

2180
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:16,520
So if everything's going wrong,

2181
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:21,800
it doesn't matter to me
because I'm on the path.

2182
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:28,190
I'm going to stay on the path on the
warpath and when to get my situation

2183
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:32,860
rectified. Stat, get some.

2184
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:39,350
All right. That's like two
hours or something right now.

2185
02:08:39,351 --> 02:08:43,820
So let's, um, I don't know,
speaking of the war path,

2186
02:08:43,940 --> 02:08:47,420
the path, yes. Yes. How could
we get people to, you know,

2187
02:08:48,440 --> 02:08:51,590
how could we assist with
people being on the ward?

2188
02:08:51,591 --> 02:08:56,150
Step one did you do to nothing?
Yeah man.

2189
02:08:56,151 --> 02:08:56,781
That's step one.

2190
02:08:56,781 --> 02:08:59,540
Straight up men will make depends
on where you are to begin with.

2191
02:08:59,541 --> 02:09:02,750
So let's face it anyway. It's
all you need. Your, your g right?

2192
02:09:02,780 --> 02:09:03,980
No need to ask anymore.

2193
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:09,040
Get origin origin main.com hundred
percent a hundred percent made in America.

2194
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:10,701
Yes.

2195
02:09:10,701 --> 02:09:15,701
The 200% geared g to get the G to
get and also 100% made in America.

2196
02:09:16,010 --> 02:09:20,690
Made in America from the dirt to the top.

2197
02:09:20,940 --> 02:09:25,340
Straight up. Yeah, because let's face
it from the top soil to the GE top.

2198
02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:29,270
Top. Slow to the top of
the Geek. Yeah. Fully.

2199
02:09:29,450 --> 02:09:34,450
And for those who care about
the aesthetics of Biggie,

2200
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:38,990
these, this theoretics
are, how should I say,

2201
02:09:40,910 --> 02:09:43,870
made specifically for Jujitsu for sure.
But I did it.

2202
02:09:43,871 --> 02:09:48,080
Two people budget is of people.
Yes, but they're like the cut.

2203
02:09:48,110 --> 02:09:51,500
You know how you'd like cut like Fords.
You did too. You see what I'm saying?

2204
02:09:51,830 --> 02:09:55,330
And they look dope too, by the way, if
you care about that kind of stuff. Yeah.

2205
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:58,520
Awesome. Do you want to make like
you don't care but you care? No,

2206
02:09:58,521 --> 02:10:03,521
I w I am and always have been
impressed by specifically dragon.

2207
02:10:05,091 --> 02:10:09,580
We've come on. Yeah, that'd be a
dragon. The or you're not like,

2208
02:10:09,890 --> 02:10:12,800
like I still am impressed it is.

2209
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,590
When you see or have you
seen the machine that they,

2210
02:10:16,760 --> 02:10:21,130
that they figure out how to weave
that thing. It's like, yeah,

2211
02:10:21,560 --> 02:10:25,640
it's in Pete's office and
it's like, uh, it's the, I'll,

2212
02:10:25,641 --> 02:10:27,620
I'll have Pete post a picture of it,
but it's still,

2213
02:10:27,670 --> 02:10:32,670
it looks like a mechanical thing from
from 1898 I batches from 1930 I bet you

2214
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:39,890
the thing is actually from 1930 we'll
have to ask Pete what year it is,

2215
02:10:40,070 --> 02:10:43,760
but that's the actual thing. It's the
old school thing that you figure out.

2216
02:10:43,850 --> 02:10:46,740
You put your program is the word,
but it's nothing.

2217
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:50,420
There's nothing digital
about this program.

2218
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:54,050
What the fabric is going to look like
from this machine. It's a freaking,

2219
02:10:54,530 --> 02:10:56,390
it's cool. Anyways. Yeah,
so that's the dragon.

2220
02:10:56,391 --> 02:11:00,290
We've also rash guards
also 100% made in America.

2221
02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:05,780
Um, tee shirts, other things,
some cool stuff on that.

2222
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:09,820
Supplements as well. Yeah. Yeah. And um,

2223
02:11:09,890 --> 02:11:13,700
supplements for your joints,
a four,

2224
02:11:13,701 --> 02:11:17,880
you're being being as a human.
Yes.

2225
02:11:18,590 --> 02:11:22,760
And for your operational capabilities?
Yes.

2226
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:25,550
So joint warfare for your joints,

2227
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:30,880
Krill oil for your being and joined and
joints discipline for your operational

2228
02:11:33,381 --> 02:11:37,080
capability,
lift,

2229
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:41,090
lift your cognitive and
your physical capabilities.

2230
02:11:42,620 --> 02:11:47,530
And then of course we got that milk,
some additional protein for that one.

2231
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:51,530
I had a big milkshake put dark
chocolate in it by the way.

2232
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:56,590
You said that on the last podcast
again? Yes. And I put a dark, dark time.

2233
02:11:56,630 --> 02:12:00,140
How was it outstanding with what
flavor? Milk, peanut butter chocolate.

2234
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:04,970
Is that your go to currently?
It is. It was the main, it
is for me too. Yeah. So it,

2235
02:12:04,980 --> 02:12:09,050
it's in a rotation in and it's
all based on like how I feel.

2236
02:12:09,260 --> 02:12:10,880
I'm just going to tell you I'm,

2237
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:16,120
I probably have had peanut
butter six times in a row.

2238
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:22,010
Yeah. Which it used to be not happening.
It would be mint six times in a row.

2239
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:27,250
And then right now I'm just so down with
that peanut butter peanut butter train

2240
02:12:27,730 --> 02:12:31,760
situation
and these supplements overall,

2241
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:34,640
especially the joint ones like Mulkey,
it's easy. It's like a kind of,

2242
02:12:35,100 --> 02:12:38,900
it just me alone with my thoughts. I'm
like, this is kind of a glamorous one.

2243
02:12:38,901 --> 02:12:42,890
The protein, hell yeah, my
muscles. But the joint warfare,

2244
02:12:42,891 --> 02:12:45,380
they don't get like the glamour.
Here's what,

2245
02:12:45,410 --> 02:12:47,600
here's what one of my buddies
was telling me yesterday,

2246
02:12:47,810 --> 02:12:50,910
one of my brethren the seals was,

2247
02:12:51,020 --> 02:12:54,500
is using vanilla gorilla and
he's like, um, he's like,

2248
02:12:54,501 --> 02:12:59,150
I'm putting it in everything.
Everything. He makes coffee,

2249
02:12:59,180 --> 02:13:02,510
boom, vanilla, the teak. Boom.
Yeah. I don't know about tea,

2250
02:13:02,511 --> 02:13:04,310
but his main thing was coffee.

2251
02:13:05,430 --> 02:13:08,720
These putting in his coffee and
he said it's like a sweetener,

2252
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:13,670
but obviously it's not right. It's not
bad for you. Yeah, it is Wheaton there.

2253
02:13:13,690 --> 02:13:16,310
Cause he was, he was,

2254
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:20,090
you know when you're talking to people
and they get like the, the like little,

2255
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:24,170
the little kid look. Yeah, he had
that. He's not going to have to put,

2256
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:26,680
I put the vanilla gorilla
there and I hate it with the,

2257
02:13:27,050 --> 02:13:31,110
I could say he was getting fired up when
he said he ate it with the blenders was

2258
02:13:31,111 --> 02:13:32,080
like that's

2259
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:36,840
it. The blender. The one. Yeah. So
technically I do the same thing,

2260
02:13:36,841 --> 02:13:41,010
but I put the coffee in, it's like a
lower and express or whatever in the milk.

2261
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:45,630
Oh. So it's like a
milkshake. But same deal by,

2262
02:13:45,631 --> 02:13:48,960
I'm sure the ratios are different in
like coffee. It is. And that's the thing.

2263
02:13:48,990 --> 02:13:53,430
It is. So if you, if you, uh,
like like coffee, ice cream,

2264
02:13:53,870 --> 02:13:56,670
you know, like that kind of stuff. We're
a coffee ice cream and like black coffee.

2265
02:13:56,671 --> 02:13:59,880
Those are two different experiences
for sure. So coffee, ice cream,

2266
02:13:59,881 --> 02:14:01,500
that's a delicious flavor when it's like,

2267
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:04,790
so it's kind of the
same deal with them all.

2268
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:09,920
Speaking of delicious strawberry and
chocolate warrior kid milk for your

2269
02:14:10,771 --> 02:14:14,190
children.
I this,

2270
02:14:14,250 --> 02:14:17,130
this could get some kind of, uh, you know,

2271
02:14:17,220 --> 02:14:19,890
I'm not going to put myself
in for a Nobel peace prize,

2272
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:24,030
but like,
hey,

2273
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:29,070
we are helping the children
of the world in a big way.

2274
02:14:29,340 --> 02:14:33,610
Yeah. With strawberry and
chocolate warrior good milk,

2275
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:38,250
because there's no other thing that
you're just as a kid, as a kid,

2276
02:14:38,251 --> 02:14:42,240
you're about that little snickers bar
hitter right now are these bad snacks in

2277
02:14:42,241 --> 02:14:46,480
the snack you hitters,
right? Sure. The right,

2278
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:51,300
I'll check with Theo Vaughn on that one
because he understands a hinders better

2279
02:14:51,301 --> 02:14:52,020
than me,

2280
02:14:52,020 --> 02:14:56,910
but if you can give your kid a
strawberry or chocolate milk heater,

2281
02:14:57,450 --> 02:15:01,560
they're just going to go smoke and
they're going to get stronger. Yup.

2282
02:15:01,890 --> 02:15:06,870
Literally healthier. Really. I told
Pete, I said on the warrior kid podcasts,

2283
02:15:06,871 --> 02:15:10,050
that warrior kid Molko will
make you stronger and he's like,

2284
02:15:10,110 --> 02:15:14,760
I don't know if you can legally
make that claim. I'm like, well,

2285
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:20,310
it's already been said and it's straight
up. How can you wait? How can you not?

2286
02:15:20,370 --> 02:15:24,690
How can that not be legally made?
Because does protein rebuild your muscles?

2287
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:29,190
Answer. Yes it does. Warrior could
milk have protein in it? Yes.

2288
02:15:30,030 --> 02:15:31,890
I guess we got to get the
kids to Jack Steele too

2289
02:15:32,990 --> 02:15:37,250
or just grow up as a kid. Healthy. Yeah.
You'll get stronger as a kid growing up.

2290
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,113
You don't have to Jack,

2291
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:43,300
so we are technically and
legally authorized to say
to the children of the world

2292
02:15:44,390 --> 02:15:49,390
warrior kid milk will make you stronger
if I get the Nobel prize for that.

2293
02:15:50,170 --> 02:15:53,080
You get a Nobel prize for helping
children around the world. Yes.

2294
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:56,930
Okay then I deserve it.
There you go.

2295
02:15:59,080 --> 02:16:02,500
Not to go too deep into the whole
thing about getting stronger,

2296
02:16:02,530 --> 02:16:04,960
like if you make the claim that
something's going to make you stronger.

2297
02:16:04,961 --> 02:16:09,961
I think that is fine like legally because
legally you can't like diagnose it

2298
02:16:10,841 --> 02:16:13,510
wasn't there. There are certain,
there's a list of things you can do.

2299
02:16:13,690 --> 02:16:16,060
You can't diagnose,
you can't oh treat.

2300
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:19,210
Do you know if their specific kind of,

2301
02:16:19,620 --> 02:16:22,660
they're more medic medically
based and I think, but I know,

2302
02:16:22,760 --> 02:16:26,240
well the only thing that we really,
the only claim that we make,

2303
02:16:26,241 --> 02:16:29,860
which is scientifically proven is the,
is the

2304
02:16:30,640 --> 02:16:34,250
deadlift capabilities. Have you
drank Jocko white tea? Is 8,000 yeah.

2305
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:36,310
Which I mean obviously
everyone's good line.

2306
02:16:36,370 --> 02:16:41,050
No one's going to argue with that
one. Nope. Cause that's just facts.

2307
02:16:41,340 --> 02:16:42,670
So if you want some of the,

2308
02:16:42,820 --> 02:16:46,900
if you want some Jocko white tea
because you need a bigger deadlift,

2309
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:51,490
which you probably do. Yeah. Then
you can get that from Amazon.

2310
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:57,840
Well, the cans from Amazon,
you can get it everywhere.

2311
02:16:58,350 --> 02:17:03,150
Everywhere. Meaning online. Just go online
man. Okay. Jocko white tea on the store.

2312
02:17:03,180 --> 02:17:06,150
Okay. There you go. On, on
what store? Jocko store.

2313
02:17:06,330 --> 02:17:08,370
Chuck was a store called Jocko store.

2314
02:17:08,730 --> 02:17:11,760
And the website is
[inaudible] dot com online.

2315
02:17:11,850 --> 02:17:16,700
Did you see the website for origin?
Origin? The industry? Yeah. Oh yeah.

2316
02:17:16,710 --> 02:17:21,660
For all the same. The Jocko, uh, joint
warfare Moke, the gies, the rash guard,

2317
02:17:21,661 --> 02:17:24,510
the origin stuff is all@originmain.com.
I did say it, but you know,

2318
02:17:24,550 --> 02:17:28,890
that's a little reminder.
Yeah. But Jocko white tea,

2319
02:17:29,610 --> 02:17:29,930
okay.

2320
02:17:29,930 --> 02:17:32,560
Is Everywhere.
Including Jocko,

2321
02:17:32,561 --> 02:17:36,560
store.com also [inaudible] dot com is
where you can get your shirts when you're

2322
02:17:36,561 --> 02:17:40,220
representing on the path. See? And
that's a big part of being on the path.

2323
02:17:40,250 --> 02:17:44,690
Actually. That's a good psychological
and physical in my experience.

2324
02:17:45,150 --> 02:17:46,720
I like the, I don't even know what
you're going to say about it. No.

2325
02:17:46,730 --> 02:17:49,490
You're going to say what helps
you stay on the path as well,

2326
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,770
saying you're not going to eat a
doughnut while you're wearing a disc.

2327
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:56,510
Nichols freedom tee shirts. That's
physically impossible. I think so.

2328
02:17:56,511 --> 02:17:59,600
Yes. You'll be like, you'll,
you'll be like the exorcist.

2329
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:02,930
You just won't be able to stop yourself
from throwing the doughnut box. Yeah.

2330
02:18:03,110 --> 02:18:06,260
In the garbage can. You know
what's weird and I'm being serious.

2331
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:09,290
It's like now and me safe bow.

2332
02:18:10,430 --> 02:18:14,720
Like I can't eat a donut. Even
if I'm by myself. Like I can't,

2333
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:20,050
like it's, it's embedded already
because of those of the path. Yeah.

2334
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:23,000
It's a,
it prevents me physically from eating.

2335
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:25,190
The only donut I could eat as one that is,

2336
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:30,290
is an actual piece of steak cut into
a circle with a piece missing from the

2337
02:18:30,440 --> 02:18:35,140
middle. Yeah. I might do that. Maybe I'm
hugging me like here's my steak donut.

2338
02:18:35,220 --> 02:18:37,730
Well, to get some, well,
here's the thing though.

2339
02:18:37,940 --> 02:18:40,490
There's such thing as like
little protein donuts. Yeah.

2340
02:18:40,491 --> 02:18:42,740
But if you look at the ingredients,
I don't know.

2341
02:18:42,741 --> 02:18:45,380
That's really what it feels like.
A Paleo pro ino healthy.

2342
02:18:45,381 --> 02:18:47,750
When people make Paleo stuff,
it's like kind of solid. Okay.

2343
02:18:47,751 --> 02:18:49,790
Why not just shape it like a stick?

2344
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:54,920
Really putting it into a
donuts. Yes. This scenario.

2345
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:57,800
That's just cause I think that's it.
I think that's the thing.

2346
02:18:57,801 --> 02:19:00,220
It's like the fact that
it's a donut Kinda is.

2347
02:19:00,230 --> 02:19:05,210
That's what kind of creates the little
thing in my, in my brain. Anyway. Anyway,

2348
02:19:05,211 --> 02:19:08,330
back to the storage.
I'll store hoodies on their shirts,

2349
02:19:08,331 --> 02:19:13,160
on their hats on there. A lot of cool
stuff on there if you want to represent,

2350
02:19:13,270 --> 02:19:14,600
if going to represent in the wild.

2351
02:19:15,570 --> 02:19:16,060
Okay.

2352
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:20,090
Jocko stored up. Come grab something.
He'd be on the DEF core path

2353
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:25,570
also. Okay. We talked about
Jack White Tea obviously.

2354
02:19:26,840 --> 02:19:29,570
Also you are subscribed to the
podcast if you haven't already.

2355
02:19:29,571 --> 02:19:32,180
That'll kind of keep
you in tune so to speak.

2356
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:36,290
Seems obvious I guess, but it doesn't
seem like a small thing, but hey,

2357
02:19:36,350 --> 02:19:41,300
it's good and subscribe. Stay tuned. Stay
in touch on iTunes, stitcher, Google play.

2358
02:19:41,420 --> 02:19:44,390
You know, anywhere where you listened
to your podcast quits. Subscribe.

2359
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:46,460
Also the worry,
your kid podcasts.

2360
02:19:47,960 --> 02:19:51,110
Is the warrior kid Parcast
better than Jocko podcast?

2361
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:54,650
I personally don't think so.
At the end of the day,

2362
02:19:54,651 --> 02:19:58,520
what he say net union say men that
you've heard that expression net net.

2363
02:19:59,300 --> 02:20:01,520
My brother says that all the time anyway.
Net Net.

2364
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:05,000
I liked the Jocko podcast
better. Here's the thing. No,

2365
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:09,890
it's not like just cut and
dry like legit competition.

2366
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:11,240
Yeah.
And here's the thing.

2367
02:20:11,240 --> 02:20:14,870
If you were to observe them
from a completely unbiased,

2368
02:20:15,320 --> 02:20:18,140
you probably don't like the warrior
could podcast because you're not in it.

2369
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:23,150
I can't creek in rebuttal my stuff.
Maybe here's the thing may be here,

2370
02:20:23,310 --> 02:20:27,970
but here's the no, no, the,

2371
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:30,950
here's the, here's the part that
kind of kind of what he sort of like,

2372
02:20:30,951 --> 02:20:34,310
he's like a rebuttal to my own opinion.
Work at podcasts.

2373
02:20:34,311 --> 02:20:37,160
Every single one of those was,
was like

2374
02:20:39,020 --> 02:20:42,140
90 like out to 85 to 100% impactful.

2375
02:20:42,141 --> 02:20:47,060
Like every little thing like that felt
like applied to me where I can like

2376
02:20:47,230 --> 02:20:50,960
whether it be an idea, not talking about
your daughter. No, you applied to you.

2377
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:53,350
To me directly. Here's the
thing. Some things yesterday,

2378
02:20:53,720 --> 02:20:57,260
six years old or whatever
you are. Yeah. Yes, but,

2379
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:00,620
and I'm not saying it doesn't apply
to my daughter. I'm not saying that.

2380
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:04,520
I'm saying it applies to me directly,
whether it be me in my own life or me,

2381
02:21:04,521 --> 02:21:07,870
how I'm going to deal with my daughter
now or my son or whatever hunted.

2382
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:12,830
Like all of the things pretty much
like that's kind of the, so net net.

2383
02:21:12,860 --> 02:21:14,330
Yeah, Jocko podcasts. Sure.

2384
02:21:14,331 --> 02:21:18,560
I like better maybe because there's kind
of more more thing. I don't know why,

2385
02:21:18,561 --> 02:21:22,000
but that's my answer.
But I will say that maybe then

2386
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:25,880
maybe you might be right,

2387
02:21:26,150 --> 02:21:31,070
but maybe because there's so there's
not as many where your kid maybe, yeah,

2388
02:21:31,550 --> 02:21:35,300
maybe I need more. I need more to shift
over to two for that to be better.

2389
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:39,680
I Dunno. Maybe either way. That's on
Itunes, stitcher. Oh yeah. That's on,

2390
02:21:39,710 --> 02:21:42,320
that's a podcast as well
that you subscribe to.

2391
02:21:42,321 --> 02:21:46,160
Also Youtube is a where you can
do to, well there's word, yeah,

2392
02:21:46,161 --> 02:21:50,270
speaking to Youtube. There's the
Jocko podcast channel on Youtube.

2393
02:21:50,450 --> 02:21:52,610
There's warrior kid podcast on Youtube,

2394
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:56,660
which we separated so that your child
won't be watching warrior King podcast and

2395
02:21:56,661 --> 02:22:01,190
then all of a sudden have the rape of
Dan King podcasts creep into their zone.

2396
02:22:01,370 --> 02:22:04,610
Right. So he separated them,
but they're both up there.

2397
02:22:04,611 --> 02:22:08,870
They're both available.
And also on the Jocko podcast,

2398
02:22:08,871 --> 02:22:12,440
that's where echo puts up videos of with,

2399
02:22:12,441 --> 02:22:17,441
with enhancements to them that make them
make the message more impactful in his

2400
02:22:19,401 --> 02:22:23,520
opinion. Well, hopefully we'll say hope.

2401
02:22:24,260 --> 02:22:25,980
Like I said though, uh, the

2402
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:27,690
Mikey and the dragons video,

2403
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:32,820
which has moved to the top slot
in my opinion for your video.

2404
02:22:32,821 --> 02:22:37,590
So which is a bold statement.
Cool. Yeah. It's a bold statement.

2405
02:22:38,280 --> 02:22:43,230
People have got tears in their eyes from
a two minute video about a kid's book.

2406
02:22:43,350 --> 02:22:44,610
That's pretty impressive.

2407
02:22:44,700 --> 02:22:49,620
Yeah. Well I do have to say I, I even had
tears in my eyes. He was the thing nuts.

2408
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:52,620
I for Real, and I'm not going
to be local humble with that.

2409
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:57,650
I don't think it's necessarily because
of me making the video because like,

2410
02:22:57,960 --> 02:23:02,400
well I dunno, I'm only speaking
for myself where Kay. So the,

2411
02:23:02,590 --> 02:23:06,420
the king died. This is a story within a
story. It's a story of a story in a story.

2412
02:23:06,421 --> 02:23:07,590
So there's like three layers there.

2413
02:23:07,591 --> 02:23:12,591
But so the idea of the king dying and
then the kid being like young and having

2414
02:23:12,691 --> 02:23:15,480
this big responsibility heaped
on his shoulders, shoulders,

2415
02:23:15,481 --> 02:23:19,970
and him being scared for some reason
on a night, just get, just play, call,

2416
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:24,030
whatever about that was, I don't
know, sensitive about that can stuff.

2417
02:23:24,240 --> 02:23:29,240
So when it's like you explaining it and
you said like you're not being off tough

2418
02:23:29,671 --> 02:23:30,380
Jocko,
you know,

2419
02:23:30,380 --> 02:23:33,360
it seems saying like you're doing
it like appropriately seems sane.

2420
02:23:33,570 --> 02:23:36,960
And then so it's like that. That's really
what kind of affected me. And I think,

2421
02:23:36,961 --> 02:23:37,291
sure,

2422
02:23:37,291 --> 02:23:40,500
I laid it out in a way where it's like
kind of delivered in the appropriate way.

2423
02:23:40,501 --> 02:23:41,940
But is it,
is it,

2424
02:23:42,220 --> 02:23:46,030
oh, I was going to ask if it was more
impactful because you and I know the whole

2425
02:23:46,031 --> 02:23:49,840
story, but people that don't know the
whole story that didn't have the book yet,

2426
02:23:49,870 --> 02:23:54,370
we're like, Ooh my God, Eh. Cause cause
we know the whole story. It's like,

2427
02:23:54,430 --> 02:23:57,610
oh that's cool. But then
people that didn't know the
whole story, we're just like,

2428
02:23:57,640 --> 02:23:58,473
ah,

2429
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:00,280
you know what?
Actually no another thing,

2430
02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:04,000
because jade said the same thing and he
didn't read the whole story and he and

2431
02:24:04,001 --> 02:24:06,490
he actually had little tears
in his eyes. He's like, yeah,

2432
02:24:06,491 --> 02:24:07,830
I have tears in my eyes
because I don't know why.

2433
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:10,180
Like trying to act like it's
just so confusing, you know?

2434
02:24:10,360 --> 02:24:11,970
But meanwhile he's all
like being all anymore.

2435
02:24:13,070 --> 02:24:17,380
Yeah. I saw what went on. So that's
the, uh, that's the youtube channel.

2436
02:24:17,500 --> 02:24:21,220
You can subscribe to that. That'd be cool.
We'd appreciate it and all that stuff.

2437
02:24:21,221 --> 02:24:25,750
Plus you can leave. The big thing about
if you subscribe to the Youtube Channel,

2438
02:24:26,620 --> 02:24:31,620
you need to comment about echo because
the only compensation that echo receives

2439
02:24:32,980 --> 02:24:37,980
for participation in this podcast is
being able to read the youtube comments

2440
02:24:38,141 --> 02:24:40,740
that say echo is sold.

2441
02:24:43,710 --> 02:24:48,550
So you go on Youtube, subscribe,
and then right echo is yoked,

2442
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:52,000
echo is jacked,
echo is looking massive,

2443
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:55,060
all that kind of stuff because
that way it'll be happy.

2444
02:24:55,540 --> 02:24:57,620
I can just pay him with that.
That's what gets paid with.

2445
02:24:57,790 --> 02:25:01,270
Yeah, that's, that's the worst idea
I've ever heard. It's not that bad,

2446
02:25:01,280 --> 02:25:05,740
but nonetheless, but you do like
it nonetheless. You pointed it out.

2447
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:10,870
Did. Yes, he did. When you
were like, you were like, oh,

2448
02:25:10,871 --> 02:25:15,010
there's always someone that says, I
Look Jack. I never said that anyway.

2449
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:20,740
Anyway, psychological warfare.
Okay. If you didn't know
what that is, is what it is.

2450
02:25:20,770 --> 02:25:24,310
It's an album with tracks.
It's on iTunes and Amazon

2451
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:29,020
music and stuffs in album matrax Jocko
saying, helping you, us, he's helping us.

2452
02:25:29,050 --> 02:25:29,883
That's what he's doing.

2453
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:34,960
Jock was helping us through moments of
weakness when they arise and they'll rice,

2454
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:38,710
you can't sprint forever
and you,

2455
02:25:38,711 --> 02:25:43,000
you might instead of taking appropriate
action when you realize you can't print

2456
02:25:43,001 --> 02:25:47,650
forever, sometimes you might want to
take a little bit more rest between sets.

2457
02:25:48,430 --> 02:25:52,720
You don't have to but so
should it too much rest.

2458
02:25:52,721 --> 02:25:54,550
You might want to yes,
exactly right.

2459
02:25:54,551 --> 02:25:59,100
And you will not ever look checked
if you're taking between sets.

2460
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:03,880
So get psychological MP3. Yes.

2461
02:26:04,630 --> 02:26:06,940
Yes.
And you'll get past those,

2462
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,540
those moments cause Jack will just help
me through it just by telling you that's

2463
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:11,680
the thing.
It's like a little spot,

2464
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:16,480
you know when you're slacking a little
spot in reference to weightlifting.

2465
02:26:16,870 --> 02:26:20,770
Yeah. If that's the analogy
someone's trying to lift
and they can't quite get it.

2466
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:23,590
And so they help you lift it a
little bit and give it a little spot.

2467
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:27,460
But the roof case weightlifting, yes.
But in this case, how you get jacked

2468
02:26:29,100 --> 02:26:33,470
his case instead of weights,
it's your slacker, um,

2469
02:26:33,700 --> 02:26:38,320
weakness that might come. I'm not saying
we're all week, but sometimes some of us,

2470
02:26:38,321 --> 02:26:41,080
a lot of us are sometimes anyway,
Jack was there for eight. Boom.

2471
02:26:41,081 --> 02:26:45,100
Psychological warfare.
Also if your workouts boring,

2472
02:26:45,340 --> 02:26:49,840
even if it's not boring, get more
fitness gear. So I incorporated, okay,

2473
02:26:49,841 --> 02:26:53,830
get it from on it.
Write on it.com/jocko fitness gear,

2474
02:26:53,950 --> 02:26:58,720
rope battle ropes, rings,
kettle bells. Of course.

2475
02:26:59,740 --> 02:27:01,540
To me,
if you don't have the kettle bells,

2476
02:27:01,541 --> 02:27:04,480
I feel like there's like one little
element, big, small, I don't know,

2477
02:27:04,510 --> 02:27:08,290
depends on who you are. But there's one
little element of life that's missing,

2478
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:12,910
that's my opinion. But when I got the
rings that changed my whole workup.

2479
02:27:13,330 --> 02:27:17,020
So what I do, what I do, you know the like
you do a bunch of cool stuff on rings.

2480
02:27:17,530 --> 02:27:21,220
I, I only do a handful of actually not
even a handful, like two or three things.

2481
02:27:22,330 --> 02:27:26,110
One of the main ones are like, you know,
when you, I make them go super low.

2482
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,380
Like maybe waste, maybe handstand
pushups in him. No, Bruh.

2483
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:33,400
I'm still a beginner at
the rings, but so, uh,

2484
02:27:33,401 --> 02:27:34,870
hold them in front of me and then I'll do,

2485
02:27:34,930 --> 02:27:38,980
it's kind of like an ab roller kind of
thing. One arm at a time or both arms?

2486
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:42,490
Both arms. And then sometimes I'll
go like wide and narrow, whatever.

2487
02:27:42,491 --> 02:27:45,940
So I'll do those. I'll do like sets
of 10 and you can adjust how high.

2488
02:27:45,950 --> 02:27:47,290
So how hard and easier it is.

2489
02:27:47,291 --> 02:27:51,490
Whatever kilometer off the ground
you're going to go full extension.

2490
02:27:51,491 --> 02:27:56,050
You can get there. I'm going to get there
nonetheless, between every exercise,

2491
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:59,770
uh, actually not between
every set you do a set of 10,

2492
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:03,370
that's like the workout because it's
not super exhausting to do it, you know?

2493
02:28:03,371 --> 02:28:06,370
So it's like an active rest.
It's Goodman.

2494
02:28:06,730 --> 02:28:11,590
I think it'll take your like workout
to the next of all does a thing.

2495
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:14,230
People say that trigger to the next cell.
That doesn't even mean anything.

2496
02:28:14,980 --> 02:28:18,370
Even if it doesn't take it. If it
takes us, will it help you get jack,

2497
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:22,190
let me briefly explain

2498
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:26,000
what that means to the next level.
So like when you do, I don't know,

2499
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:30,680
dead lifts or odd or no shoulder
press or something, like when your

2500
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:36,590
curls, all victim curls and tricep
extension, when you do these things,

2501
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:38,930
you're like sense your like
core or whatever is stronger.

2502
02:28:38,931 --> 02:28:41,780
And this is just what I'm like,
you feel when your core is strong,

2503
02:28:41,781 --> 02:28:45,370
it feels like you have way better balance.
You have like way better control of,

2504
02:28:45,371 --> 02:28:49,250
of the weights. He gets
stronger overall. Boom. Just,

2505
02:28:49,251 --> 02:28:53,200
just from rinks shit. Anyway. Yeah.
Anyway, [inaudible] dot com that's,

2506
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:55,280
that's where you get all this cool stuff.

2507
02:28:55,490 --> 02:28:58,430
If you want to get your mind smarter

2508
02:28:59,060 --> 02:29:01,290
and tougher and get
your brain more jacked,

2509
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:08,760
you want to do your brain more
jacked. Uh, we've got some books, uh,

2510
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:13,610
Mike in the dragons that is out there
are more being printed at this time.

2511
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:15,620
I'm printing as many as humanly possible.

2512
02:29:16,190 --> 02:29:20,900
Order it immediately so that I
know and I can get it to you. Um,

2513
02:29:21,470 --> 02:29:24,530
it's common. So it's, we've,
we've shipped out some,

2514
02:29:24,531 --> 02:29:27,530
we got some more coming in right now,
so yeah, if you haven't ordered it,

2515
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:30,800
ordered it yet, then order it now. Uh,

2516
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:35,890
the feedback is awesome right now and
thank you for posting the reviews on

2517
02:29:35,901 --> 02:29:36,530
Amazon.

2518
02:29:36,530 --> 02:29:40,940
That's so cool to read and see little
pictures of kids reading the book and I'm

2519
02:29:40,941 --> 02:29:41,960
just super stoked on that book,

2520
02:29:41,961 --> 02:29:44,780
so thank you for that and weigh the
warrior kid for the kids. I don't know,

2521
02:29:44,810 --> 02:29:46,130
maybe just a little bit older.

2522
02:29:46,640 --> 02:29:51,640
That's a book about getting on the path
for kids and it's going to help them in

2523
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:57,250
every possible element of their
life that I can think of right now.

2524
02:29:59,060 --> 02:30:02,330
It will. It will. It will help
them. Don't make them smarter.

2525
02:30:02,670 --> 02:30:04,190
It will make them work harder.

2526
02:30:04,220 --> 02:30:06,470
It'll make them understand
discipline will make them stronger.

2527
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:08,540
It'll just help them across the board.

2528
02:30:08,780 --> 02:30:12,200
That's the way the warrior kid and in
the follow on mission of the follow on

2529
02:30:12,201 --> 02:30:14,450
book to that is where the
warrior kid marks mission.

2530
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:18,710
The next is the discipline equals field.

2531
02:30:19,040 --> 02:30:21,200
The discipline equals
freedom field manual,

2532
02:30:21,650 --> 02:30:26,330
which is a book about how to get
after it. Yeah, they'll book.

2533
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:29,170
It's the book about how to get it isn't,

2534
02:30:29,210 --> 02:30:33,290
it is not a throwaway book
by any stretch. No, it is.

2535
02:30:34,250 --> 02:30:39,170
How would you describe it? Manual. It's
a manual, but I mean instrument. No.

2536
02:30:39,171 --> 02:30:44,120
What's the word you used
earlier? Aesthetically.
Aesthetically. Aesthetically.

2537
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:46,880
Could you possibly look,

2538
02:30:46,910 --> 02:30:50,120
just look on the external part.

2539
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:54,920
Just the cover of the field manual and
think maybe I'll do a little extra work

2540
02:30:54,921 --> 02:30:57,170
today. Yes. It's entirely possible.

2541
02:30:57,300 --> 02:31:01,980
Yeah, fully. And he was, you know
what's in it? Yeah. Get after it.

2542
02:31:01,981 --> 02:31:05,550
Material the, well, and I
was thinking about this too,

2543
02:31:05,551 --> 02:31:07,200
not extensive thought,

2544
02:31:07,230 --> 02:31:12,090
but there's an audio version of
this true cure, which is cool.

2545
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:15,630
Which is good. But it's Kinda like one
of those things where you kind of like,

2546
02:31:15,631 --> 02:31:20,310
man, I kind of want the
physical book. Even if I'm,
if I'm more of an book person,

2547
02:31:21,290 --> 02:31:25,590
I, I want that physical book
because of its aesthetics heavy.

2548
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:29,470
It's heavy. It has black pages. Like
let's just put it to you that, well,

2549
02:31:29,471 --> 02:31:32,190
let's just start with that. Have you
ever seen a book with blank pages? No.

2550
02:31:32,191 --> 02:31:35,070
You haven't? No. Get to get
the field manual right there.

2551
02:31:35,071 --> 02:31:38,790
If you do want the audio version than
it's on iTunes, Amazon music, Google play.

2552
02:31:38,791 --> 02:31:43,791
It's not on audible because I wanted
you to be able to use it as a alarm.

2553
02:31:45,420 --> 02:31:47,250
Sure. Some of those
things, little warnings,

2554
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:51,460
the tracks ready to be played at a
moment's notice. And that's the thing too,

2555
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:53,430
like if you timed,
if you time,

2556
02:31:53,431 --> 02:31:58,380
if you set up a timer where when you
were going to lunch sugarcoated lies,

2557
02:31:58,381 --> 02:32:02,820
plate it, keeping check
real men. Perfect example.

2558
02:32:03,070 --> 02:32:06,360
Because the thing is like some of these
chapters or whatever you're going to

2559
02:32:06,361 --> 02:32:09,300
identify with more than let's
say the next chapter, you know,

2560
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:13,110
especially like if you like
donuts or make streets of sorts,

2561
02:32:13,460 --> 02:32:15,360
you know the sugar could lies one.

2562
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:18,150
You're going to be referencing that one
a little bit more, right. So it's like,

2563
02:32:18,151 --> 02:32:21,090
okay. You know, so you have
that option now. That's good.

2564
02:32:21,091 --> 02:32:25,340
And put it on the timer as
good check. Oh, uh, yeah. The,

2565
02:32:25,370 --> 02:32:28,920
the next book is that,
I'll talk about two books together.

2566
02:32:28,921 --> 02:32:30,270
Extreme ownership and
dichotomy of leadership.

2567
02:32:30,271 --> 02:32:34,530
These are two books about the
lessons learned on the battlefield.

2568
02:32:35,160 --> 02:32:37,530
Myself and Leif Babin wrote the books,

2569
02:32:37,531 --> 02:32:42,180
he was in task unit bruiser as
the Charlie platoon commander.

2570
02:32:43,080 --> 02:32:46,470
And we took the lessons that we learned
over there, we brought them back,

2571
02:32:46,471 --> 02:32:50,340
we started teaching them to the seals
that were getting ready to deploy and we

2572
02:32:50,341 --> 02:32:53,490
wrote extreme ownership when we got out
and started working with companies and

2573
02:32:53,491 --> 02:32:58,170
saw that all the lessons that we learned
transferred to the civilian sector.

2574
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:02,910
And then we wrote the dichotomy
of leadership as a follow on book,

2575
02:33:03,030 --> 02:33:06,210
which some people are saying is better.

2576
02:33:07,890 --> 02:33:12,060
I don't know which one is better, but I
do know that they will make you better.

2577
02:33:12,390 --> 02:33:15,450
They will make you a better leader.
So check those out.

2578
02:33:15,930 --> 02:33:19,350
Extreme ownership dichotomy of leadership.
Mikey and the dragon's way,

2579
02:33:19,351 --> 02:33:23,010
the warrior kid, Mark's mission and
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2580
02:33:23,220 --> 02:33:27,420
You can get your brain jacked,
which is the word of the day.

2581
02:33:28,280 --> 02:33:31,920
Echo, uh, echelon front. That's
a leadership consultancy.

2582

02:33:36,361 --> 02:33:40,110

That's what we do.

2588
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:54,830
We've got the muster coming in 2019
Chicago and Denver and we're also doing

2589
02:33:55,651 --> 02:33:59,250
Sydney, so checkout extreme
ownership.com for details on that.

2590
02:33:59,610 --> 02:34:04,610
All of the past musters have sold out
these musters we'll sell out as well.

2591
02:34:06,360 --> 02:34:10,410
So try and get an early
so that you can come.

2592
02:34:10,411 --> 02:34:12,360
We actually turned people away.

2593
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:17,040
We turned to a pretty good
number of people away from
musters zero zero seven in

2594
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:18,063
Francisco in that

2595
02:34:18,340 --> 02:34:21,400
that doesn't feel good.
You feel kind of bad.

2596
02:34:22,030 --> 02:34:26,650
So try and register early for that.
And then of course f Overwatch.

2597
02:34:27,430 --> 02:34:31,810
This is where we are taking people
from our old community in the Spec ops,

2598
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:36,370
special operations community and the
combat aviation community folks that were

But as I said earlier,

02:35:50,240 --> 02:35:53,240
most of these questions you
already know the answers to

2615
02:35:55,180 --> 02:35:56,800
you already know the right thing to do.

2616
02:35:56,801 --> 02:35:58,720
You already know what
you're supposed to do.

2617
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:03,840
You already know how to get on the
war path and stay on the war path.

2618
02:36:04,120 --> 02:36:07,570
It's by getting out there every single day

2619
02:36:09,640 --> 02:36:13,490
and getting after it.
Until next time,
