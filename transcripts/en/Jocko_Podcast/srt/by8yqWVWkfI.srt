1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:06,050
This is Jocko podcast number
53 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,990
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:19,040
At what point
do you quit?

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:24,310
At what point
did you give in?

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,130
At what point do you surrender and
what is it that makes you surrender?

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:34,653
The enemy

7
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,500
fatigue, hunger, thirst,

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:42,550
bitter cold.

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,150
Who are these men

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,370
that decide

11
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,560
that they will not
surrender no matter what?

12
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,200
What will,

13
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,640
what humans will do?
They have,

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,390
yeah,

15
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,390
that they decide they are going to
fight on no matter what they face.

16
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,350
Well,
I will tell you these men,

17
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,813
amen.

18
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,750
They're human beings like you like me,

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:38,970
human beings that decide they're going
to fight on despite being surrounded by

20
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:40,451
the enemy.

21
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:45,190
Despite the hunger and the danger
and the thirst and the bitter cold,

22
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,070
they decide they will not surrender.

23
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,483
Yeah,

24
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,080
and we can find examples of
these men throughout history.

25
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,390
But one of the four most examples
comes from the Korean War

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,600
in late November and into mid December
of 1950 when 30,000 UN troops,

27
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:18,260
mostly American,

28
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,470
we're surrounded by 120,000
communist Chinese forces

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,010
in these Americans were attacked, attacked
by the enemy, and attacked by the,

30
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,480
the bitter, freezing cold and
attacked by hunger and fear.

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,660
And yet they would not and
they did not surrender.

32
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,230
Or tonight we're going to hear from a
lieutenant in the United States Marine

33
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,420
Corps, Joseph R, O,

34
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:57,421
n who served as a mortar section
commander for Baker Company,

35
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,690
First Seventh Marine Regiment,

36
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,490
First Marine Division.

37
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,880
Okay.

38
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,170
In his book,
which is called colder than hell.

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,750
And the book starts off with one of the
best short overviews of the Korean War

40
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,620
I've ever read, likely because it's
written by a man who was there,

41
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,850
a man named General Raymond
Davis. Ray Davis, who,

42
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,773
first of all,

43
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,210
he was a battalion commander in World
War II at the battle of Pellalou awarded

44
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:39,211
the Navy Cross there for leading his
men against overwhelming Japanese fire.

45
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,790
And in Korea he was
awarded the Medal of honor

46
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,050
as well as two silver stars,
a Legion of Merit,

47
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,120
and a bronze star

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,980
as the commander of the first
battalion seventh marines.

49
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,510
Okay.

50
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,350
And beyond that,

51
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:09,351
he also served as the third
marine division commander
in Vietnam in 1969 where

52
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:15,300
he was awarded the Navy Distinguished
Service Medal and three republic of

53
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,900
Vietnam Gallantry Crosses.
So when he speaks,

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,460
I think maybe we should listen.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,033
Yeah.

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,120
And I'm going to start with that
forward by General Davis in the book,

57
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,360
Colder Than Hell.
My Joe,

58
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,430
twice in 1950 during the first
months of the Korean War,

59
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,280
the United States faced
military catastrophe.

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,680
Both situations occurred because of
American errors of diplomacy and faulty

61
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,514
intelligence.

62
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,450
And because our military was not prepared
to meet a determined enemy on the

63
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,284
battlefield,

64
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:09,120
North Korea and China where the
enemies that exploited our failings

65
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,340
on two occasions that year,
they caught us by surprise,

66
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,970
launching massive attacks first
against our allies, South Korea,

67
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,640
and that against our
own inadequate forces.

68
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:21,970
Yeah.

69
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,090
Both times the consequences
were devastating.

70
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,410
There were tragic numbers of casualties
in the ranks of our soldiers.

71
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:34,411
And Marines and American prestige
worldwide was severely impaired.

72
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,630
The surprise invasion of South Korea by
North Korea with a supportive communist

73
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:45,631
China and the Soviet Union was a virtually
invited by the United States in the

74
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,240
South Koreans.
South Korea was vulnerable.

75
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,580
It's soldiers were ill-equipped,
poorly trained and improperly deployed.

76
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,470
The American forces at that time,

77
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,710
victims of Washington politics and
false economies were nearly as bad off

78
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,270
following the end of world
war two drown draw down.

79
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,420
They were in skeletonized formation.

80
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,660
Sad be undertrained and
inadequately equipped.

81
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,030
So there's a little warning for us today.
You need somebody.

82
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,910
Somebody asked me that question,
what's your foreign policy?

83
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,850
Can you say it in 140 characters?
Somebody asked me that on Twitter.

84
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,720
I answered it in one word. My
foreign policy, his strength.

85
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,610
This is why.

86
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,160
Okay,

87
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,780
back to the book.
Moreover,

88
00:06:37,781 --> 00:06:41,320
our secretary of State had proclaimed to
the world that the Korean Peninsula was

89
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:45,790
outside the area of American
vital interests. North Korea,

90
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,910
China and the Soviet Union read that
message to mean that the United States

91
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,000
would not defend South Korea
against outside aggression.

92
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,740
South Korea would be
theirs for the taking.

93
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,590
We now know of messages exchanged between
Joseph Stalin and the North Korean

94
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:09,291
President Kim Il Sung that explored our
weakness and concluded that South Korea

95
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:14,690
could be captured in five days.
Subsequently,

96
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,460
the North Koreans launched a sudden and
massive invasion solve the North Korean

97
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:19,951
capital.

98
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:24,440
It's quickly taken and soon all that
country was overrun except for one small

99
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,750
pocket around the port of Pusan.

100
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,960
That pocket was formed by American troops
on ready as they were that President

101
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,630
Harry Truman hurried into Korea in
response to the crisis at great sacrifice.

102
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:45,220
These American soldiers with a follow
on brigade of marines held the Pusan

103
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:49,420
perimeter long enough to allow forces
to assemble for an amphibious assault on

104
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,660
Incheon behind the North Korean lines.

105
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,540
We recaptured soul and the North
Koreans were put on the run.

106
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:58,790
Okay.

107
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,870
Fearing entrapment,

108
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,520
they fled back across their border to
the North American and South Korean

109
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,150
troops.

110
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,530
We're joined by soldiers from other
United Nations countries and pursued the

111
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,310
aggressors deep into North Korea.
Our mission was to fold,

112
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,580
to punish the North Koreans and to block
the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

113
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,510
If it threatened to enter the war?

114
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,130
Yeah.

115
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,740
Because of a failure of intelligence.
However,

116
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,830
we were far too late to deter the Chinese.

117
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,390
They had already positioned vast numbers
of their well trained soldiers in the

118
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:37,170
mountains of North Korea.
We were sued under heavy attack,

119
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,330
fighting a numerically superior enemy
in unfavorable terrain and blue brutally

120
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:43,164
cold weather.

121
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,240
The UN forces predominantly American
were chased out of North Korea.

122
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:49,710
Okay.

123
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,120
At the chosen, whereas of war where
we were outnumbered 10 to one,

124
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,680
the Chinese generals prematurely boasted
of the destruction of the First Marine

125
00:08:59,681 --> 00:09:03,790
Division.
Yet the opposite happened there.

126
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,820
Although the marines
were forced to withdraw,

127
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,590
we destroyed several Chinese divisions
as we fought our way to the sea and to

128
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:15,460
escape.
Our withdrawal was a successful one,

129
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,710
but we paid a terrible price.

130
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,080
Casualties reduced the division
to nearly half its strength.

131
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,030
The three rifle companies at first
battalion seventh Marine Regiment,

132
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,410
which I was privileged to command and
dirt losses of even greater proportions.

133
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,090
My battalion had been hastily activated
in response to President Truman's urgent

134
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:43,620
call to action.
It was a thrown together rifle company,

135
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,940
a collection of regulars gathered from
marine corps posts and stations all over

136
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:52,470
the world and reservists mostly untrained
who were suddenly called from their

137
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:57,210
homes, jobs, schools with
only a few days of training.

138
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,450
Okay.

139
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,380
They were embarked aboard a ship heading
across the Pacific and thrown into

140
00:10:02,381 --> 00:10:03,214
combat.

141
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,290
They had to learn to
fight while under fire.

142
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,200
They're saving grace was that they were
led by disciplined officers and NCOC who

143
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:20,030
showed them by upfront example
how to fight like marines,

144
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,310
although they suffered casualties that
proper preparation would have avoided.

145
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,820
They learned well and they
hardened and define rifle company.

146
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,130
No North Korean or Chinese force ever
stopped them from taking it objective or

147
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:38,660
overcame their position.

148
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:46,310
Let us do all we can to assure that no
future generation of young Americans need

149
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,650
to go to war unprepared

150
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,480
as were those heroes who
went to Korea in 1950

151
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,180
and again,
that is the foreword of the book,

152
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:08,200
which was written by General Raymond
Davis, Medal of honor winner.

153
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,460
And like I said,

154
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,600
the book is written by
Joe Oh and Joseph Owen,

155
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,270
who was marine corps officer.

156
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,070
And
let's continue on.

157
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,130
And now we start hearing from
Joe and they're at Camp Lejeune,

158
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,870
North Carolina. Nobody at Camp
Lajune had expected a shooting war.

159
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,930
We nor we were ready for one.
So they're, they're, they're,

160
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,870
they're just kind of peace time,
peace, time, marines, you know,

161
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:46,140
kind of doing their
thing and all of a sudden

162
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,990
the North Koreans attack and here we go.

163
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,650
They're all sitting around listening
to the radio, a bunch of marines.

164
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,390
The announcer continued
more than 2000 Americans,

165
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,630
military advisers and civilian workers
and their families are said to be in the

166
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:04,300
path of North Koreans.
Surprise, aggression.

167
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,790
Their fate is unknown at this time.

168
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,650
American involvement in the
new war is not clear war.

169
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,573
Yeah.

170
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,800
The possibility of American marines
in a combat role. Excited us.

171
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,820
So these guys are young, not all of them.
There's, there's, there's definitely,

172
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:26,560
we're gonna run into many World War
II veterans, but the young kids,

173
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,650
they don't know. They want to get
after it there. They're fired up.

174
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,740
They're so fired up back to the book.

175
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,780
One story alleged that a commando force
of volunteers was forming up for an

176
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:38,740
immediate commitment to battle.

177
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,370
Yeah.

178
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,300
That one tied up phone lines on the base.

179
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:46,580
As we tried to track down the commando
headquarters in order to volunteer.

180
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:51,470
They're all ready to rock and roll
now. Then they start seeing what,

181
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,130
what's beginning to occur.
They see that we're surrounded.

182
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:58,950
They see that we're kind of getting
the North Koreans are getting the best,

183
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,860
if not routing back to the book.

184
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,830
Americans at home were stunned
by reports that their army,

185
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,330
the conqueror of the mighty Germany
and Japan only five years before was

186
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,200
outnumbered,

187
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,850
outgunned and out fought by
the upstart North Koreans.

188
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,140
Yeah.

189
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,550
General Macarthur called for a full
division of Marines to help him turn back

190
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,360
the North Koreans.
The Marine Corps welcomed the call,

191
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,900
but we did not have a full division to
put in the field like all the services.

192
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,920
The core had been stripped of men and
weapons in order to reduce itself to the

193
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:37,020
level of the 1930s

194
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:42,150
both the first and second marine
divisions were less than half strength.

195
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,240
The core would need to draw men from
guard detachments to ships companies and

196
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:50,250
posts and stations throughout the world,

197
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,000
but it still wouldn't find
enough troops to fill a division.

198
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,640
President Truman thus authorize the
commandant of the Marine Corps to call up

199
00:13:59,641 --> 00:14:04,510
the reserves,
so it was,

200
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,120
again, this is a warning
as a nation and as a,

201
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,070
as an individual cumin,
don't let down your guard.

202
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,080
Peacetime will not last
and the weaker you look,

203
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,920
the sooner the peacetime we'll end.

204
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,640
Now they get the orders
standby to ship out

205
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,960
on the Saturday evening before we left
Camp Lejune Dorothy, so that's Joe's wife.

206
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:37,900
Dorothy hired a babysitter and we
went to the officer's Club for dinner.

207
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,820
There were candles out at our table
which was covered in white linen and set

208
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:43,990
with heavy silverware.

209
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,890
The food was delicious and plentiful and
I would think about it often in Korea

210
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,530
when my men and I were hungry and cold
that night,

211
00:14:55,531 --> 00:15:00,330
Dorothy's hair glistened like gold and
the candle light and her eyes smiled

212
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:02,010
bright and blue and warm.

213
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,440
We danced and laughed with the
other lieutenants and their wives.

214
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,513
Yeah.

215
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,720
For some of the couples
are closest friends.

216
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,560
There was the last night they
would ever have together.

217
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,460
So they depart lagoon and they
show up at Camp Pendleton,

218
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:29,900
California and they get
to Camp Pendleton and he,

219
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,410
they will,
we'll talk more about this,

220
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:37,050
but camp Pendleton is a,
believe it or not,

221
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:41,990
it's on the coast of California and there
some pretty aggressive hills in Calif

222
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,160
in Camp Pendleton,

223
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,220
which I've spent many nights on
cause we would work up there and uh,

224
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:49,853
they,
they can,

225
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,940
they can turn some soft men into some
hard men pretty quickly or break men if

226
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:57,830
they're too weak.
So back to the book,

227
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:02,831
our ranks were filled by 215 men and
seven officers who had never before served

228
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:07,070
together. Half of our enlisted men
were infantry trained regulars.

229
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,910
The other half were reservists,
most of whom were youngsters who knew,

230
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,810
knew little of marine infantry
and its method methods.

231
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,400
Five weeks after we first
formed up at Camp Pendleton,

232
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,580
we went into the attack against North
Korean soldiers who were dug into a hill

233
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,850
north of Seoul.

234
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,400
And we had spent half of that time
on board ship on the way to war.

235
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,010
So let me break that down to you.
They have five weeks,

236
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:35,960
so five weeks from when they form up,

237
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,150
five weeks later they're attacking
North Korean troops. So just Fyi,

238
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,210
for a seal platoon that's going to Iraq,

239
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,510
we used to work up for a full year.

240
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,540
This is after we went through seal
training and after we went through seal

241
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,620
qualification training,

242
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,530
and after all the guys show up the team
and go to special schools and then you

243
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:58,200
get formed up into a platoon, you have
an unbelievable workup to prepare. And,

244
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,250
and the Marine Corps does this too. I
mean the army, everyone does this now.

245
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,060
That's the amount of preparation
that it takes to prepare for combat.

246
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,650
And here are these guys five
weeks of which, what was it?

247
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,750
Half that time is spent on a ship
just sailing over there. Hmm.

248
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:20,580
Unbelievable. Back to the book, The Sun,

249
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:25,581
scorched hills of Camp Pendleton had over
the years tough in the legs and tested

250
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,310
the spirits of thousands of
America's best fighting men.

251
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,900
One of those towering hills loomed
across the road from our training site,

252
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,360
so again,
you want to get tough,

253
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,710
get on some hills with a rucksack on your
back that that will do it to you and I

254
00:17:44,201 --> 00:17:49,090
guess I kind of included those little
sections about Camp Pendleton hills for my

255
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,500
pleasure and thinking about those hills.

256
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,393
Awesome.

257
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,730
Back to the book.
They're going through,

258
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,230
they're going through this training
and they're getting ready to deploy and

259
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:03,940
we'll go back to the book now.

260
00:18:03,941 --> 00:18:08,680
Dorothy took $75 of our scant resources
and bought an airline ticket from

261
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:13,681
Syracuse to San Diego each night
after we had dismissed the troops,

262
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,030
bill and I,
this is Bill Graybar,

263
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:21,031
he's another one of the officer's
bill and I caught a ride to the hotel

264
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,810
restaurants in the little village of
San Clemente. We're closed that late,

265
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:28,570
but Dorothy would have a
cold supper waiting for me.

266
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,220
Then we would stroll to the beach and
listen to the waves crash across the sand.

267
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
During those walks we talked about the
babies and we made plans for my return

268
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:40,660
from Korea.
My next assignment.

269
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,710
I assured her would give us at least
two years at a good duty station.

270
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:50,550
Maybe I would be senior enough for us
to rate decent quarters in the mornings

271
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,790
early.

272
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,010
It's still dark bill Graybar and I would
grab a ride back to camp with the other

273
00:18:57,011 --> 00:18:57,844
officers.

274
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,500
Everyone except the driver's slept all
the way crowded against each other and

275
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,850
the tight seats of the car.

276
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:10,020
We were very tired but we were young
men and we did dearly love our beautiful

277
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:11,290
wives

278
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,510
and you're going to see throughout this
book that even though his wife was not

279
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,610
with him,
she was with him the whole time.

280
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,950
I like many spouses are when guys are
deployed overseas and now they are on

281
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:30,850
board the ship.

282
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,170
The ship is getting ready to
pull out of the San Diego Bay.

283
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:41,850
Back to the book. The wives remained on
the dock long after we had gone aboard.

284
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,910
The sqirl of bagpipes
sounded as we wave to them.

285
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,510
Pfc Timmy Killeen Able Company stood on
the fan tail of the oak can outgun and

286
00:19:54,341 --> 00:19:58,540
his bagpipes filled the feeding
afternoon with the marines.

287
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:03,541
Hymn handkerchiefs flooded from the
dock and the ship's horn blasted.

288
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,960
We were underway.
There were tears,

289
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,200
but marines and marine wives aren't
ashamed of tears when they're him plays.

290
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,533
Okay.

291
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,540
So now they're heading over to Korea.

292
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,800
They're in cramped quarters.

293
00:20:25,801 --> 00:20:29,670
I've done a couple deployments
on board ships and there's,

294
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,040
and fibia ships is what they're called.

295
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,530
And these ships were meant to
take people overseas, don't.

296
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,460
The ones that I deployed on were,
were what drove us,

297
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,540
what drove soldiers to Vietnam. We used
to deploy on those ships for six months,

298
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,670
but it's just really cramped.
You know, their basic,

299
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,830
you're basically like a cattle car,
a giant cattle car ship,

300
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,640
and they just pack everyone on there.
It's really tight and uh,

301
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,810
there's not much to do on there, but
you know, you take a bunch of marines,

302
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:58,780
you put them on a ship and they figure
something out. Back to the book.

303
00:20:58,781 --> 00:21:03,040
Staff Sergeant Richard revealed
himself to be an all purpose NCO and an

304
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,930
acquisition specialist.

305
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,730
One day he produced a set of boxing
gloves and the men of Baker one seven

306
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,490
immediately became avid pugilists

307
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,160
okay.

308
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,580
For three exuberant rounds to
the delight of the company,

309
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,970
the little bull by folk and the little
gorilla Lupa cine engaged in mutual

310
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:26,340
annihilation.

311
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,530
When Sergeant Richard claimed his
mess gear to end the Bra, the troops,

312
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:35,460
and much of the ship's crew
or an a cheering frenzy,
it had been a grand fight.

313
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,730
Both men were covered in
blood at bruisers bruises,

314
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,330
and at the final clang they wrapped
arms and leaned against each other.

315
00:21:42,331 --> 00:21:46,440
Exhausted my mortar men
swarmed into the square,

316
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,770
pummeling by folk with
congratulations Perkins,

317
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,440
who had been holding by forks,
glasses,

318
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,020
placed them carefully
over his swollen eyes.

319
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,890
I saw Burris then gently guide
by fork out of the ring. Gino,

320
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,930
Brian Lupa,

321
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:05,310
Chinese platoon sergeant followed with
his man and Baker one seven we're still

322
00:22:05,311 --> 00:22:08,790
whistling and cheering when
the two fighters and their
handlers went through the

323
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:11,100
hatch and down the ladder to sick bay.

324
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,140
Joe Casaba stood next to me,
so go joke,

325
00:22:18,141 --> 00:22:21,420
or is one of the platoon
commanders stood next to me.

326
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,830
This outfit is coming together.
He said Joe rarely smiled,

327
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:29,340
but there was a big grin on his
face after that fight. So there's

328
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,790
you. You notice that in these
stories about combat wrestling,

329
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:39,600
fighting, boxing, there
is something to it.

330
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:43,470
There is something to it
that bonds men together.

331
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,443
Fact,

332
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,290
back to the book when we
weren't on deck with the troops,

333
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,860
the officer spent the waking
hours around the wardroom table,

334
00:22:54,861 --> 00:22:58,280
so the wardroom ownership is where
the officer's eat. Captain Wilcox now,

335
00:22:58,281 --> 00:23:00,500
this is the introduction,
introduction to Captain Wilcox.

336
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,910
He's the company commander and
he's a a vet from EOL Jima,

337
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,250
Captain Wilcox,
lettuce.

338
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:10,670
In review of the principles and
lessons of the of rifle company combat,

339
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,810
he and Joker Saba use their
own battle experience.

340
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,180
As experiences has illustration,

341
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,780
they focused on the chaos of combat
and how the best laid plans always

342
00:23:23,211 --> 00:23:25,640
disintegrated under enemy fire.

343
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:29,330
That's why we got to
keep our plants simple.

344
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,893
Hmm.

345
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,560
War is hell.

346
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,490
Captain Wilcox who had much
experience at it would tell us,

347
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,740
but you never know what particular
kind of hell it is going to be.

348
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,040
We studied the after actions report

349
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,390
that had come from the fifth marines.

350
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:51,170
The North Koreans they had faced
were tough skilled fighters.

351
00:23:51,171 --> 00:23:55,280
Every bit is tenacious in battle as the
Japanese had been in the bitter Pacific

352
00:23:55,281 --> 00:23:59,300
island fighting of the last war,
the red soldiers,

353
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,220
fifth marines called them gluecks.

354
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,030
We're well trained in the Russian
style of combat with effective use of

355
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:07,760
supporting armor,
mortars and artillery.

356
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,770
They were men who also were
adept at night fighting.

357
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,520
Fighting at night was a combat
skill we had yet to learn.

358
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,740
We would do so under fire
and at a terrible cost.

359
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,660
So Joe Owen is actually,
he's not a platoon commander,

360
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,330
he is a,
he's the mortar section commander.

361
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:35,120
So in a company of, yeah,
call it 200 200 marines,

362
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,200
there's multiple rifle platoons,
maybe 40 guys,

363
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,180
50 guys in each one of
those rifle platoons.

364
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,730
And then there's a little
section of mortar guys.

365
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,830
And mortars aren't indirect fire weapons.

366
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:49,460
So for those of you that
don't know anything about
mortars, mortars, shoot rounds,

367
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:51,770
they're there. You see him
in movies, there's a tube,

368
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,550
they're basically a tube and they're
at a really high angle and the,

369
00:24:55,551 --> 00:24:59,720
and you drop rounds into it and they fire
at a very high altitude and high angle.

370
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:03,020
And then they dropped down from
straight above and hit targets. And so,

371
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,730
so Joe and in this company is
in charge of the mortar section.

372
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:14,830
Back to the book, when Baker one
seven was still on the way to war,

373
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,860
the first and fifth marines forced the
landing across the tidal flats at Inchon

374
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,093
harbor.

375
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,700
The radio and the ship's wardroom was
tuned to the tactical net and we listened

376
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:31,420
to commanders on the beach
as they reported the action
to their senior echelons

377
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:36,370
and made call for air and artillery
support and ammunition resupply

378
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:43,190
over the static and crackling
transmission. We could
hear shells exploding,

379
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:46,310
small arms, fire, battlefield curses,

380
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,560
and the screams of wounded men.

381
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,050
The transmissions were piped out
onto the deck with the troops.

382
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,210
Also listened to the grim sounds.

383
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,980
I left the wardroom and went
out to be with my mortar men.

384
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,130
They sat in a tight cluster
staring intently at a
loudspeaker as they heard the

385
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:09,550
war that was about to swallow us.

386
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:19,240
That's a real introduction right there.
You're, you know, you're going to award.

387
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,150
You get to listen to guys on the ground
and a fierce firefight and hear the

388
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:26,200
shouts and screams of the wounded.
That's a reality.

389
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,660
That's a reality check right there
for those guys. So at this point,

390
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,750
um, Owen, he,

391
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,860
he kind of wants to pick up a platoon
instead of being the mortar section,

392
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:41,140
he kind of feels like mortar section,
you know, they're a little bit in the,

393
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,850
in the rear and he wants to
be a rifle platoon. If you,

394
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,930
if you remember what Mac Alan said that
the last book we did about the Korean

395
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,790
War and you know, rifle platoon
commander, rifle platoon commander, right.

396
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,230
For two commander. That's what if you're
gung Ho, that's what you want to do.

397
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,800
And so Joe, when he feels kind of
like, you know, I wish I was a platoon.

398
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,380
I wish I was a rifle platoon commander.
That's what I want to do.

399
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,190
But he's a mortar section
commander. Okay, that's fine. Well,

400
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:09,930
he tries to get that
job and he says he is,

401
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,480
he's kind of pressing to get
that job up the chain of command.

402
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,800
I should have backed off.
I plowed on Sir.

403
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,850
The word is that the first and fifth
marines are running short on lieutenants.

404
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,010
I like to request transfer as replacement.

405
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,210
The captain turned to Caney first
sergeant, if you will excuse us.

406
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,580
I'd like award alone with Lieutenant Owen.

407
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,420
Okay.

408
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:32,170
Yes sir. Responded Caney. So he kind
of gets rid of the senior enlisted guy.

409
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,970
He knew I was about to get reamed any
smirked at me as he disappeared behind the

410
00:27:36,971 --> 00:27:41,260
pile of crates. Captain Wilcox
gave me that glare. Once again,

411
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:46,090
you want to transfer out of Baker
one seven sir. It's the, Oh,

412
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,450
it's only that I want to put my training
of some use before the fighting ends

413
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,130
and to hell with your men. To hell with
the company. Is that right, lieutenant?

414
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,360
No Sir. Captain, it's just that. It's
just that you want to jump ship on us.

415
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,010
The skippers face glistened with press
perspiration and he turned into a

416
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:07,990
steaming red. He had been angry with
me before, but never like this, sir.

417
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,850
I, okay lieutenant, here's what you do.

418
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,300
You put your request for transfer in
writing and I'll forward it approved.

419
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,440
No sense holding back a gung Ho hot
shot. The second lieutenant, sir.

420
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,910
It's not that I want to leave the outfit,

421
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,880
it's just that I thought that
put your request in writing.

422
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,750
That's all lieutenant
dismissed, sir. I dismissed.

423
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,090
So this is your typical typical meat
ball that thinks he's gonna. You know,

424
00:28:32,091 --> 00:28:35,840
he's just been gung Ho was trying
to make something happen. Yeah,

425
00:28:35,841 --> 00:28:38,930
it's not a not a good way to be.
And you can see that.

426
00:28:38,931 --> 00:28:41,300
So that's another thing you've got to
think about other people's perspective,

427
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,490
right? You gotta think about
your boss's perspective.

428
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,940
Your boss is sitting here trying to get
this company together and then one of

429
00:28:46,941 --> 00:28:50,330
his section leaders go lower. Go some
world, right? Right. Kind of for him.

430
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:54,410
So what does meatball meatball, oh,
sorry. That's just an expression for,

431
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,210
it's an expression for a new
guy in the seal teams. Oh,

432
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,030
meatball or a meat stick or Fng.
Any one of those can be utilized.

433
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,860
So I guess I threw it on on the, the new
guy here. It kind of slipped out. Yeah.

434
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,173
Oh good.

435
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:15,190
Now they get on shore and

436
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:16,911
back to the book,

437
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:20,270
we passed a company of third battalion
that had been pulled off the line.

438
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,850
It's men were sprawled along the road.

439
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,510
Unshaven and ragged wearied
by days of fighting.

440
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,470
So there's another,
another little wake up call

441
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,730
seeing the guys that are coming off
the line now they get into a position.

442
00:29:37,731 --> 00:29:41,000
This is Baker six move forward out.
Captain Wilcox ordered.

443
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,040
We all reported ready as we
started across the bean field,

444
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,530
we were greeted by a fuselage of fracking.

445
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:51,220
Sounds North Korean bullets tearing
through the bean plants, frack, frack,

446
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:55,270
frack all around us. I kept an
eye on my men. They crouched low,

447
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:59,560
but they stayed together and moved ahead.
Then the Cri Korman God,

448
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:01,450
I'm hit a few feet from me.

449
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,810
A marine from Kaiser's
platoon rived on the ground,

450
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:08,470
his hands clutching his belly,
grayish red intestines,

451
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:12,010
pushed through his fingers and blood
stained the ground as he thrashed about

452
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:16,180
screaming in his pain and
terror for the first time.

453
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,860
I felt the shivers of dread,
the awful fear that comes with combat.

454
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:24,580
I froze a second.

455
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:29,870
How many seconds until I once again became
aware of the flacking sounds and the

456
00:30:30,821 --> 00:30:34,240
bean plants and I yelled at the men,
move it you people keep moving.

457
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,470
They bent lower to the ground.
As we went forward,

458
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,800
the North Korean mortars came,

459
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,720
spouts of earth and black smoke leap the
about us laced with flame and screaming

460
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:47,554
shrapnel.

461
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,660
The leaves from being plants spawned
in flurries and the ground shook.

462
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,890
I was suddenly in the midst of a
frenzied storm of noise. Mortars,

463
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:59,440
whistled and crashed.
Bullets, wind and leaves.

464
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,630
Flacked men shouted
prayers and blasphemies.

465
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,180
The far end of the bean field
was the dyke of a rice patty.

466
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,980
We headed for its cover.

467
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,790
A string of mortar shells exploded
around us and a man threw himself to the

468
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:17,380
ground kicking and screaming, can't
take this. I can't take this screech.

469
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:21,820
The fear stricken marine tiny
curled up himself into a fetal ball.

470
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,440
I ran to him and prodded him with a
bottom. My car being on your feet,

471
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,470
his head was buried in his arms.
Can't take this.

472
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:34,471
He wailed get up or I'll shoot you the
sound of the words coming from my mouth

473
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:38,710
was unreal to me.
Jesus don't shoot me.

474
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:43,090
The man whined tiers cut Pale streaks
through the dust on his cheeks.

475
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,900
As he stared in horror at my car been,
which was inches from his face,

476
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,670
I grabbed the man by his collar and
pulled him up to his feet, move. I yelled,

477
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:56,380
Sargent Dale from the first platoon
ran toward us. I got him lieutenant,

478
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,780
he's from my platoon.
Dale said,

479
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:01,923
so there's fear.

480
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,030
Then you can see Joe in his feeling
fear and he's dealing with it.

481
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,990
And this other young marine is feeling
fear and he's not dealing with it.

482
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:12,880
Okay.

483
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,300
And they, they finally get to that dike
across the field. Back to the book,

484
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,170
I crawled up the dyke to peer over
the top smoke obscured my view,

485
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,990
but far ahead and across the road,
I detected some movement.

486
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,990
The enemy positions were
difficult to locate.

487
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,540
No flash came from their
weapons when they fired.

488
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,860
I raised my binoculars before I
could focus on the target. However,

489
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:37,720
a flurry of bullets pelted the dike and
spurts of pebbles and dirt stuck my face.

490
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,180
I jerked my head down
and to cover beside me.

491
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:43,490
A rifleman tumbled away from the dyke.

492
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,420
He made a choking sound and his
helmet bounce to the ground.

493
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,770
Blood gushed from his head,
which suddenly became a wet crimson pulp.

494
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:58,310
Another wave of fear shuttered threw
me a massive paralyzing force again.

495
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,480
I froze, aware only of that
blood drenched face and head.

496
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,820
Okay.

497
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,870
Captain Wilcox voiced cracking
crackled out of my walkie talkie.

498
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:13,820
Baker five this is six. Come in the
voice. Snap me from my paralysis.

499
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,520
Baker six this is five comment six

500
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,620
I was scrambling back up the dike.

501
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,830
I knew the skipper wanted the
sixties the sixties are his mortar.

502
00:33:22,831 --> 00:33:26,280
60 millimeter mortars to bear on the
North Koreans who had us under fire.

503
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,140
Get those guns cranked up.

504
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:33,170
Five over Roger that six I said to the
radio on the double sergeant wing gun was

505
00:33:34,411 --> 00:33:37,620
a few yards away behind the dike and
I crawled over to get in front of it.

506
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,390
Stand by for a chief fire mission.

507
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,990
I called the wing it number one gun
standing by a chief fire mission,

508
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,160
the staunch wing, it called back
with all the will I could muster.

509
00:33:47,161 --> 00:33:49,830
I forced my head above the
dyke binoculars at the ready.

510
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,140
The terror of having my head blown off
to a pulp was diminished by fear of

511
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:57,420
losing the respect of my men.

512
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:02,300
So there's a couple of things there.

513
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,740
You've heard me say you
trained how you fight.

514
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,960
What they go back to is the fundamentals
that they practiced and trained.

515
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:14,110
And we didn't dive too much in
the training. But if you ever,

516
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,920
if you've ever seen marines in the
field with a 60 millimeter mortar,

517
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,900
I haven't seen army guys.
I'm sure they're outstanding too.

518
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:22,630
But when you see the marines setting
up a mortar for a fire mission,

519
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:27,100
it's beautiful. It's a beautiful thing.
And this is exactly what it's like.

520
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:31,210
Even in, even in the 90s
you know, 40 years after,

521
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,460
after the Korean War,
when I would watch the,

522
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:36,790
the mortar men set up a mortar to shoot.
It was just like that.

523
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,010
They'd be stand by for fire mission.
And then you know,

524
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,700
one of the sergeant would call out
number one guns standing by a chief fire

525
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:43,534
mission.

526
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:48,190
You go back to your training and those
fundamental basics that you learn,

527
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:53,440
the simple commands, that's what you
go back to. That's why you train.

528
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,730
That's why you use repetition.
So when that fear comes up,

529
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:02,440
you go back to what you know your
instinct becomes. Instead of cowering,

530
00:35:02,441 --> 00:35:05,020
your instinct becomes to do
what you've trained how to do.

531
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:08,660
Okay,

532
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,411
back to the book.

533
00:35:09,411 --> 00:35:13,100
All along the dikes are marines
were sprawled heads below the edge.

534
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,760
The corpsman had moved their wounded
alongside the road waiting for the

535
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,760
ambulance, jeeps, the
meat wagons to come up.

536
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,390
There were two bodies
face covered by ponchos.

537
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,590
They were Baker one sevens first
killed in action. The KIAA.

538
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:30,020
So Baker's is the company that they're in

539
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,230
that you could,

540
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,990
that's why they keep referring to Baker
one seven first battalion Baker company

541
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,980
back to the book someone said

542
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,120
won't be nothing left up there by
the time the are artillery gets it.

543
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:49,270
So what's going on here is they call
in some, some big guns, some big,

544
00:35:49,271 --> 00:35:50,920
so 60 millimeter mortar small.

545
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,210
And then when you start calling in how
it serves a big giant bombs are coming

546
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:59,650
from the sky. Uh, that's what
they call some of those in.

547
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,510
And do you know,

548
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,730
you're sitting there sitting there
watching the mountain where these,

549
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:06,550
where these North Koreans aren't,
they're seeing massive explosions.

550
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,740
And so now back to the book, someone said,
won't be nothing left of them up there.

551
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:15,220
By the time that artillery lets up,
Staff Sergeant Richard,

552
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:18,970
the company armor was crouched near
us, don't fool yourself. He said,

553
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:23,860
artillery never wipes out. The geeks
softens them up and keeps their head down,

554
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,030
but they'll be there waiting
when the guns led up.

555
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,620
This is another lesson we learned
a lot about. You know, you think,

556
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:37,440
you think that no one could survive
something and they do survive it.

557
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,620
It we, we used to, when we were
running training, we had the,

558
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,320
the Humvees would be shooting blanks.
It's training.

559
00:36:44,321 --> 00:36:47,890
So the Humvees would be big 50 caliber
machine guns and they shoot blanks into a

560
00:36:47,891 --> 00:36:48,724
building.

561
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,360
And then the guys in the building would
come and shoot back at them and the guys

562
00:36:52,361 --> 00:36:54,700
and just going through the training,
the seals, all, you know, we,

563
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:58,630
we shot a bunch of 50 cal in there. Those
guys wouldn't be alive. And you know,

564
00:36:58,631 --> 00:37:00,520
I would say no,
actually they will be alive.

565
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,740
They will be alive because I've seen it.
And those 50 cows,

566
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,000
they're on awesome weapon. But there's a
guy, two rooms deep inside that building,

567
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,400
you can shoot all those rounds in there.
He's going to be okay.

568
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,890
And as soon as you let up, he's going
to be there shooting back at you.

569
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:18,040
And it's the same thing with obviously
with a big artillery and the North

570
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,570
Koreans are dug in.
I scrambled to my feet,

571
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,560
keep moving.
The men were all up and they ran after me,

572
00:37:26,561 --> 00:37:29,950
bent under the weight of their guns
and Ammo. Get us the hell out of here.

573
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:34,720
Someone cried. And so what do they do?
They attack. So when you're pinned down,

574
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:37,840
it's just another example when
you're pinned down attack,

575
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,400
and here's what it looks like.

576
00:37:39,401 --> 00:37:43,630
Back to the book to have Kaiser squads
moved up in short bounce while a third

577
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:44,890
laid a base of fire.

578
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,783
Okay,

579
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,933
cover move.

580
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,460
You're going to be covering move all
throughout this book and every time we

581
00:37:51,461 --> 00:37:51,941
bring it up,

582
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:55,180
I'm going to mention it because I want to
make sure everyone that's listening go.

583
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,120
Those folks that are in the military,
you hear it every single time.

584
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,580
This is the first one of many to have.

585
00:38:00,581 --> 00:38:04,060
Kaiser squad moved up in short bounds
while third laid a base of fire,

586
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,040
the first 50 yards when easily.

587
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:09,850
Then the North Koreans popped out
of cover and took us under fire.

588
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,690
Suddenly the ground before us with skate,
with torrents of bullets,

589
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:18,310
mortar shells whistled in and exploded
the long car. Kaiser's line corpsman,

590
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,820
corpsman, so if you don't know a
corpsman has as a medic in the,

591
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,591
in the army,

592
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:28,591
it's a medic in the navy it's called a
corpsman and navy corpsman are the ones

593
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:32,110
that go and deploy with
the Marine Corps as medics.

594
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:34,480
So that's when you hear those,
those Corman calls.

595
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:38,710
That's what it Korman Korman
came a despairing whale,

596
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:43,120
add top alert stuff from prone position
and ran toward the wounded man as enemy

597
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:45,700
bullets.
Spurted around him beside me.

598
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:49,000
Another man went down with
a grunt and did not move.

599
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,250
Fear slammed my gut once more
and I was flat on the deck.

600
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,790
Nichols was down there with me.
What do you want to do?

601
00:38:57,791 --> 00:39:01,520
Lieutenant Nickels,
plump young fee,

602
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,540
face street with dirt and sweat showed
the same fear that had me in its terrible

603
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:11,530
grip.
Jesus the boy depends on me.

604
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,530
I forced my head up.

605
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:20,620
That's a classic.
What do you want to do lieutenant?

606
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,570
I was,
I think I might have talked about this,

607
00:39:26,571 --> 00:39:30,470
but I was in when I was in Sri Lanka
and I was a young kid and there was all

608
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:35,180
those guys that were hardcore combat
veterans and one of the captains,

609
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:38,270
army captains,
again Sri Lankan army captain,

610
00:39:38,271 --> 00:39:40,340
who had been in tons of combat.

611
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,540
And I was talking to almost trying to
like be garner information about war cause

612
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:46,700
I hadn't been in any
and he'd been in a ton.

613
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,760
He was wounded and shrapnel in his face.

614
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,820
And I'm talking to him, you know
about it. And he said, you know,

615
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,030
when you're in a war,
he goes,

616
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:03,350
it's pretty easy to take care of
yourself and take care of yourself.

617
00:40:03,351 --> 00:40:06,680
Like he said, if I was in a war,
if I, when we were in a firefight,

618
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,840
if I just had to take care of myself,
I'd be okay.

619
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,790
But when you're in charge of everyone
is totally different than now.

620
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:18,140
All of a sudden you got people saying,
what do you want us to do,

621
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:20,690
lieutenant?
And that's the pressure,

622
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:23,390
which I will never forget
him telling me that story.

623
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,920
And that's a great example of it right
there. Sure. He's scared. He's scared,

624
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:30,590
but he's got a mortar section
waiting for them to tell,

625
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:33,410
waiting for him to tell him
what to do to save them.

626
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,170
Now we get introduced to a
guy named Lieutenant Lee,

627
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,780
who's a Chinese American guy,

628
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:46,440
very by the book and very hardcore.

629
00:40:46,441 --> 00:40:49,340
You're going to hear plenty about
Lieutenant Lee year. We tend to lead,

630
00:40:49,341 --> 00:40:52,500
came upon Baldwins gun. Sir, I
think we should move this gun.

631
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:55,140
Baldwin said to his lieutenant,
it's kicking up dust.

632
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:57,810
You have a good position here.
Baldwin responded. Lieutenant Lee,

633
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,460
I'll show you how to
handle the dust problem.

634
00:40:59,461 --> 00:41:03,270
Lee opened up as canteen and walked
around the machine gun sprinkling precious

635
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:04,110
water as he went.

636
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:09,180
Now fire off a burst orderly and
machine gun fired but raised no dust.

637
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,780
Lieutenant Lee walked on
up the hill ignoring enemy
bullets that hit around him.

638
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,550
Moving forward a little bit. Hey
Lee called by folk. Get down.

639
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:26,180
We're getting shot at by full cad.
Lieutenant Lee's attention.

640
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,180
The lieutenant dashed where by
folk was hugging the ground.

641
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:32,030
You address me as Lee.
He asked,

642
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,830
standing over the astonished young
marine, Jesus, yeah, get down,

643
00:41:36,831 --> 00:41:38,960
you're drawing fire.
You on your feet.

644
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:43,370
Demanded Lee Bullets Zip through the
year punctuating the bizarre scene of a

645
00:41:43,371 --> 00:41:47,180
lieutenant bracing a PFC to attention
in the midst of a firefight.

646
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,370
You call me Lieutenant Lee or Sir,
you understand that marine?

647
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,950
Yes, yes, yes sir.

648
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,250
Stammered by folk wishing that he were
in a very deep foxhole and you never

649
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:04,220
forget that. Understand now
carry on. Set the lieutenant.

650
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,500
And he proceeded to walk
further up the hill,

651
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,870
seemingly oblivious to the enemy fire.

652
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,080
What the hell thought by folk.

653
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,920
And he got up to walk behind Lee,

654
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:20,330
the rest of the mortar squad or
rose and followed. So like I said,

655
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,710
Lee is by the book.
And that's an extreme example.

656
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:28,340
I don't think I necessarily
agree with that example either,

657
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,110
but Lee's going to hold the line

658
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,610
and maybe there was much danger as a,
as he thought.

659
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:38,720
But instilling that discipline,
he's given no slack

660
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,530
back to the book while the
mortars obscured the enemy's view.

661
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,420
Van Winkle moved his people up.

662
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,280
So you've got the mortars dropping fire
and that allows vanwinkle to move his

663
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:55,850
people. That's called cover and move. By
the way, nearing the top of the ravine,

664
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,110
Hank Kaiser positioned his assault squad
to follow a barrage of grenades into

665
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,390
the enemy positions.
As soon as the mortars lifted.

666
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,440
So you've got three situations
you got the mortars are going in.

667
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,570
That's the first cover.
Then once the mortars left,

668
00:43:08,571 --> 00:43:10,550
they're going to throw grenades.
That's your second cover.

669
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,070
The ammo carriers for the marines machine
guns filled in with riflemen on the

670
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:19,220
line of assault, ready to charge
up the last few yards of ground.

671
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:24,230
Lee was with them bayonet fixed to
the top of his car being the mortars.

672
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:26,480
Fired,
fired a final barrage there.

673
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:30,710
Explosions were followed by the sharper
impact of grenades thrown at enemy holes.

674
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,850
Shouts and war cries swelled
from charging marines who leaped.

675
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:38,630
Bayonets pointed into the enemy positions
that were dug in along the face of the

676
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:42,950
rich. Some of the North Korean stood
to fight their bayonets also fixed,

677
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,400
but they were cut down.
Others scurried over the hill.

678
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,250
Many were shot from behind
is they tried to escape.

679
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,080
We all knew had been a
far from perfect exercise.

680
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,960
Some of the men had been
slow to respond to direction.

681
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:03,230
Not all of our orders were clear
enough for quick and effective fire and

682
00:44:03,511 --> 00:44:04,344
movement.

683
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:10,750
We were fortunate that the enemy had not
chosen a fight to the death defense of

684
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:14,440
this hill as they would have advanced
as they would would we advanced further

685
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:17,200
north.
So think about this point.

686
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,040
Not all of our orders were clear enough
for quick and effective fire movement.

687
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,150
He's not even blaming the guys.

688
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,660
He knows that the mistake was that
they weren't being simple, clear,

689
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:31,830
concise with their waters
and that makes everything lag

690
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:35,561
back to the book.

691
00:44:35,561 --> 00:44:39,760
And we had nearly reached the top captain
Wilcox pushed weavers platoon through

692
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,520
Kaiser's for the final assault platoon.

693
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:45,730
Sergeant King led the charge
and we could hear is piercing.

694
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:49,630
Rebel yells all over the hill.
Once again,

695
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:54,160
it was a ragged performance orders
confused in the hellish noise.

696
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:59,350
Men who bunched close together and some
who hesitated to risk the move against

697
00:44:59,351 --> 00:45:02,890
enemy fire.
However clumsy we were though,

698
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:08,470
we had the fundamentals right. The NCO
is directed, their sectors of fire,

699
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,250
the fire teams went forward in bounds
covering each other as they protect

700
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:18,390
progressed and our machine gun and mortar
fire stayed ahead of the events and

701
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:22,570
kept the enemy heads down.
That's the, that's what,

702
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,670
that's what small unit tactics are. It's
cover and move, cover, move, cover, move.

703
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:35,950
Now they're digging in some some night
defenses and because there are these

704
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,240
peaks, I mean this huge
mountainous terrain, steep cliffs,

705
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,630
they end up dis aggregated across
the battlefield. So they're not,

706
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,930
they're not right next to each other
cause there's valleys between them.

707
00:45:48,110 --> 00:45:48,943
Hmm.

708
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,090
Back to the book we had,

709
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:55,620
we had to set our own isolated perimeters
and we couldn't tie our flanks to the

710
00:45:55,621 --> 00:45:59,580
other companies for mutual support.
The same held true for attack.

711
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,550
Almost always the battalion was channel.

712
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:05,880
It channeled into attacking some
with one company, one hill at a time.

713
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,840
This sort of isolated fighting made it
difficult to communicate with battalion

714
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:13,860
and other companies.

715
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:19,490
That problem was not solved much of the
time we company level officers were on

716
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,650
our own initiative, decentralized
command, just decentralized command.

717
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,870
So imagine this,
you can't talk to battalion.

718
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,990
There was a hill that cuts your
radio signal. You have to beat,

719
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:33,090
you have to know what the
intent is of the operation,

720
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,450
and you have to be out there ready to
ready to execute on your own to the best

721
00:46:36,451 --> 00:46:38,550
of your ability underneath
the commander's intent.

722
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,553
Hmm.

723
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,950
Back to the book,
I learned how to deflect the fear

724
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:48,840
after the first jolt of it,

725
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,620
which came with the initial
shock of coming under fire,

726
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:57,150
I would force myself upright and
attempt to read the situation before the

727
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:59,940
skippers. Boys came crackling
out of the walkie talkie.

728
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,810
Once I had rammed myself into action,

729
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:08,520
the fear subsided.
It never completely went away though.

730
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:12,000
So people ask this all the time,
how are we going to overcome fear?

731
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:16,890
And what did he do to overcome fear?
He forced himself into action,

732
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:22,080
didn't weight you. Start feeling
that fear. Go, go, get up.

733
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:26,280
Take a look at that situation.
Try and analyze it in his own clock.

734
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:29,310
What he made for himself. The timer
that he made for himself was I'm to,

735
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,720
I'm going to assess the situation
before the boss calls me.

736
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,950
So that's the time we put on himself
that that forced him into action.

737
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:37,290
Yeah.

738
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,190
So we say this over and over again.
You're afraid of something. Step into it.

739
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,380
Take action.
Don't wait

740
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:50,880
back to the book. There was no
deflecting the confusion. That's it.

741
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:52,090
Came with every firefight,

742
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,190
but we'll during patterns of noise and
grotesque scenes exploded all around.

743
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,810
Men screamed it.
Rage and pain and fear.

744
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,910
Swarms of bullets.

745
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:09,030
Wind and splattered close by the mortars
blasted her old flames and slices of

746
00:48:09,581 --> 00:48:13,840
steel and raised clouds
of greasy black smoke.

747
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:19,340
The sparing voices yelled corpsman
and someone would surely call,

748
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:24,250
what do we do, lieutenant? In the turmoil,

749
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,450
the officers and sergeants made
themselves visible and we shouted, orders,

750
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,430
watch your sector or move up or
bear on me or CUC machine gun,

751
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:35,380
10 o'clock,
300 yards.

752
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,760
We subdued the fear and showed
the men that we were in command,

753
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:46,090
and I've talked about this one before
too. I talk all the time about, oh,

754
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:48,670
you got to explain to everybody why you
got explained to why we want everyone to

755
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:49,240
be happy.

756
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,840
You want people to form the plan with
you and you want it to be their plan.

757
00:48:51,841 --> 00:48:52,990
Do you want them to take ownership?

758
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,770
And then I also say that when
you have a critical situation,

759
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,770
you have to lead and that's what
he's talking about right here.

760
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:04,480
You have to lead and that's what they do.
They would give these to orders, simple,

761
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:05,230
clear,

762
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,230
direct orders of what to do
in this situation and show
the men that they were in

763
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:12,334
command

764
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,911
back to the book.

765
00:49:16,911 --> 00:49:20,690
We could have alleviated some of the
confusion if our walkie talkies had worked

766
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:22,070
at that as advertised.

767
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,720
The handheld two way radios were supposed
to transmit and receive up to a mile

768
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:27,554
in distance.

769
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,790
We found that they rarely
functioned over a hundred yards,

770
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:36,260
never over on even terrain. We carried
them because they were all we had,

771
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,420
but we had little faith in them.
Instead,

772
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,850
just like frontline military
leadership throughout history,

773
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,170
we relied on line of sight communications,
arm and hand signals,

774
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:53,410
and we sent runners back and forth
in those first five days of combat.

775
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:58,850
I learned to stay visible and I
learned the value of a good runner.

776
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:04,780
The North Koreans use to whistles and
bugles for bag battlefield command more

777
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:08,600
effective by far than our walkie talkies.

778
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:15,010
And I'm a huge proponent of
verbal commands and you know,

779
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:18,280
I think life's told this story a bunch of
times where I've told me you don't use,

780
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,080
he's, he's trying to tell these guys
what to do over the radio. And I said,

781
00:50:21,081 --> 00:50:25,550
hey leaf, give him verbal commands and
cause when guys are, when, when you're,

782
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:28,100
when you're working,
there's this weird,

783
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:31,370
there's everyone's talking on the radio
and it turns into white noise and so

784
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:32,204
they're not responding.

785
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,560
But when you give a verbal command
in the seal teams in the military,

786
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,670
you get trained that if I tell echo peel,
right,

787
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,420
you're going to, when you hear that
your instinct and your training,

788
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,700
it tells you to repeat that command. So
you're gonna repeat it. The next person.

789
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:47,780
When they hear it,
they're going to repeat it.

790
00:50:47,781 --> 00:50:52,040
So everyone repeats the verbal command.
So when you say verbal command,

791
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:56,420
that's like the radio. It's like, yes,
it's yelling and yelling and talking,

792
00:50:56,421 --> 00:51:00,720
but in all actuality it's a
yelling. It's yelling. And so the,

793
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,010
the radio's just sometimes,
you know, and our,

794
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:08,020
our radios are infinitely better than
these radios and even while I was in the

795
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:11,690
radio is made vast improvements in
by the yet. By the time I retired,

796
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:12,950
the radios were pretty damn good.

797
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:17,360
But there are times if
the radio is not working,

798
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:20,480
you've got to go with the verbal commands
and you, that's why you got to train.

799
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,270
You've got to train for the verbal
train without radio's a bunch.

800
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,010
I always tell guys,
yeah, take the rails off,

801
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,160
make sure you can do it
without the radios. It,

802
00:51:26,161 --> 00:51:28,220
how's it going to go with their
communication? Net goes down.

803
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,100
You got to have that backup
communication plan all the time.

804
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:32,223
Hmm.

805
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:39,150
Now here we are in another,

806
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:45,150
another firefight does is basically a
massive book of firefights back to the

807
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:45,361
book.

808
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:48,630
The North Koreans disappeared into the
deep ditch that ran along the other side

809
00:51:48,631 --> 00:51:52,500
of the road. They were moving in
our direction and we dove for the,

810
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:56,760
our own ditch. Grenades flew
toward us, but landed wide.

811
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,410
There was a machine gun up ahead.
However,

812
00:51:58,411 --> 00:52:02,520
I couldn't locate it and it started
and it started to fire down on us.

813
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,930
I tossed two grenades in the ditch where
the North Koreans were concealed and

814
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:11,610
told burrows to have his men crawl up,
call, crawl over a clump of boulders,

815
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,000
20 paces away.
When the squad and its mortar we're in.

816
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,500
I told Nicholas to go for it.
We were crouched together,

817
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:22,590
but nickel,
but as Nichols turned to crawl away,

818
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:26,820
a bullet speared his chest and through
him backward against him, against me,

819
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,850
his blood spattered,
my dungarees.

820
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:35,540
The boy made a terrible rattling sound
and then was still his teenage face.

821
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:42,640
Expressionless Burris watched horrified
and I waved him back when he began to

822
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:47,640
crawl towards us.
Then I took a deep breath,

823
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,960
pressed myself flat to the ground and
crept rapidly away from the ditch.

824
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,220
I left Nichols behind
me where he had died.

825
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,760
Harsh firefights and they,
they,

826
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,490
they wrap up this,
they keep taking their objectives,

827
00:53:10,491 --> 00:53:12,050
their taken a lot of casualties.

828
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:16,160
And this section here is after the
fight is over, back to the book,

829
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,100
we grew silent thinking of our families.

830
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:24,470
I took the snapshots from the webbing
inside my helmet and remembered their

831
00:53:24,471 --> 00:53:29,010
images one by one.
Then I thought about the days,

832
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,790
next mission and reviewed the
fighting we had done that day.

833
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,830
I tried to blank out the blood,

834
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:39,120
screams men killing each other
and dying the ground. Exploding.

835
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:41,820
Burst of flame and stabbing tracers,

836
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:45,300
hot smell of weapons at full automatic.

837
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:49,560
The stench of guts and feces
oozing from a dead marine

838
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:53,250
and the shuttering.
Fear.

839
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:03,903
Okay.

840
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,990
And they continue pushing.

841
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:13,500
They're pushing north and they're on
one of these patrols heading north.

842
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,780
And we'll go back to the book.
Through my binoculars,

843
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:20,860
I saw bearded old Korean emerged
from one of the huts. Papasan.

844
00:54:20,861 --> 00:54:25,840
We called these GRANDPA's who wore
traditional garb of high black top hat and

845
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:27,340
flowing white robes.

846
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:30,940
The old fellow stood before
his doorway watching,

847
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:34,870
but wilderness has weapons laden.
Marines passed through his village,

848
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:38,460
crack went brain x car.

849
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,120
Been only a few inches from me,
and the old man fell to the ground.

850
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,570
The tall black hat fell beside him.

851
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:51,960
Got The bastard exclaimed [inaudible]
his car bean was still up searching for

852
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:55,210
another target. God Damn Fool. I yelled,

853
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:57,400
astonished at the murderous act.

854
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:59,210
Yeah,

855
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,990
without fought. I slammed the butt of my
own car. Been in the brain. It's ribs,

856
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,050
brain IHC, scream with pain and
went down to the ground writhing.

857
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,880
I stood over him, poised to deliver
another, but stroke got damn full.

858
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,230
I screamed again. As right came from
behind me and held my arms wing.

859
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:19,430
It was with right and pulled my car
being away. Hold it, lieutenant,

860
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,440
right shouted in my ear. Hold it. What
the hell happened? You see what he did?

861
00:55:24,441 --> 00:55:27,080
I screamed.
I'll kill the deer.

862
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:30,800
Torsky the corpsman was already
kneeling beside Branick.

863
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:34,070
He snapped a Syrette of
morphine and Jab brandix arm.

864
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,560
I endeavored to control myself.
Deep breaths. Okay, Sergeant.

865
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:41,690
I said,
and right released is hold.

866
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:46,280
The men were circling looking for
me to break. They were silent.

867
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:49,760
Goddammit.
He shot that old man for nothing.

868
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,670
I yelled through the pain brain at grown.
I thought he was a Goddamn goop.

869
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,930
I thought he had a weapon.
Any,

870
00:55:56,931 --> 00:56:00,680
have you seen what happened when
could ask the men? No one responded.

871
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:06,830
No witnesses, right? Said softly to me.
Whatever happened, nobody saw anything.

872
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,290
The realization hit me.
No one except me.

873
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,380
He had witnessed brain
IX shooting that old man.

874
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,170
But if someone had seen me hit Branick,

875
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:18,380
I could be subject to a court
martial for striking enlisted man.

876
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,610
No witnesses, right? Said
again. No one saw anything.

877
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:28,000
This stays in the mortars.
I heard someone say meaning,

878
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:31,390
we're just going to keep this amongst
ourselves. Yeah, someone else responded.

879
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,110
This stays with us.
There was a murmur of a cent.

880
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:40,780
Shall I moved them out? Lieutenant,
right? Asked. Yeah, sergeant.

881
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,820
I answered numbly moved them out.

882
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,580
The morphine had not yet
taken as his effect on break.

883
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,430
He ground his teeth together to hold
back cries of pain and he was scared.

884
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,510
I bent over him and said, you
know, you and I know what happened.

885
00:56:55,511 --> 00:56:58,630
Break and you're going
to have to live with it.

886
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,730
Break nodded his head.

887
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,840
He said nothing but blinked his tear
filled eyes and nodded his head,

888
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,270
take care of him doc. Then I went
to catch up with the mortar men.

889
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,310
When I walked past the old man's hut,

890
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,430
a circle of women and children
surrounded the body crying,

891
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,730
their sorrow and old woman caught my eye.

892
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,440
I'm sorry. I said, although she
wouldn't understand my words.

893
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:25,420
We're all very sorry.

894
00:57:30,590 --> 00:57:31,423
Okay.

895
00:57:33,540 --> 00:57:36,240
It's madness and again,

896
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,910
you young military leaders out there,

897
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:43,740
you've got to watch your people and you
got to give them good commander's intent.

898
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,000
They got to understand,

899
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,000
they got to understand what's right and
what's wrong and that's going to come

900
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:48,834
from you.

901
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:56,240
Now at this point in the book,
and again,

902
00:57:56,241 --> 00:58:00,260
obviously I'm not reading the entire book,

903
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:04,100
but you all should see, you can
capture everything that's in between,

904
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,480
but I'm jumping forward a little bit here.
They get relieved by the army.

905
00:58:08,481 --> 00:58:13,481
They moved to the rear and they start
getting word on what they're going to be

906
00:58:14,661 --> 00:58:18,770
doing. Back to the book under
the glare of the lantern.

907
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:23,771
Captain Wilcox spread a map on the
hood and we jostled for a view maps.

908
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,700
To this part of the world were scarce.

909
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:29,450
This is the first one we had seen
of the country beyond Hamhung.

910
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,940
It was a topographic chart made by the
Japanese during their occupation of Korea,

911
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,500
the characters and language on the map
where Japanese place names and legends

912
00:58:39,501 --> 00:58:40,910
had no meaning for us,

913
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:44,780
but we could read the physical
features and the contour lines.

914
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,740
That terrain they showed
was a military nightmare,

915
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,230
roadblock and ambush territory.

916
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,140
It was a country of high steep hills,
deep valleys and sharp ridge lines.

917
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,980
The lower elevations
were largely forested.

918
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,750
Settlements were sparse than the few
roads twisted snake like through tight

919
00:59:05,751 --> 00:59:10,490
passes and along river beds
at the northern extremity.

920
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:15,520
The map at the end of 70 miles of a
narrow corkscrew roadway was a meandering

921
00:59:16,641 --> 00:59:20,720
blue dot.
That was the chosen reservoir.

922
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,030
The Chinese have committed themselves
to this war began captain Wilcox.

923
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,380
They are in force.

924
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,420
They are slicing through the Republic
of North Korea army up north,

925
00:59:32,421 --> 00:59:37,020
like a hot knife through butter
up here.

926
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,610
He used his band ed as a pointer to
indicate the Chinese advance there people

927
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:41,930
will,

928
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:46,770
we will fight are the hundred and 24th
division of the regular Chinese army.

929
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:50,790
Definite and confirmed no matter
what Tokyo wants to believe.

930
00:59:50,970 --> 00:59:53,970
So the military command was in Japan.
They weren't Korea,

931
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,930
the military was the military command.
The generals were over in Tokyo.

932
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,280
So he's saying no matter what,

933
00:59:59,281 --> 01:00:02,820
Tokyo wants to believe this is who
we're fighting back to the book.

934
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,860
They're tough.
Well trained soldiers,

935
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:09,980
10,000 of them in all of their officers
or combat experienced their very best.

936
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,010
Okay.

937
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:13,791
After the briefing,

938
01:00:13,791 --> 01:00:17,660
I requested a word alone with Captain
Wilcox to ask him if we could leave

939
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:21,440
sergeant. Right. So sergeant right, you've
heard his name mentioned a few times.

940
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:26,060
He was the senior enlisted guy working
directly for captain up for a Lieutenant

941
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,830
Owen and it's, it's actually
time for him to go home.

942
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,840
I request a word alone with Captain Wilcox
to ask him if we could leave sergeant

943
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,090
right behind with the Co
when the company moved out.

944
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,610
Sergeant White has done a good job for us,
but he's a short timer.

945
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:44,900
Just waiting for paperwork
I offered. Furthermore, sir,

946
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:47,900
it's not good for the troops to
see him with his morale down.

947
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:52,040
I like to replace him with sergeant wing
yet before we hit anything serious up

948
01:00:52,041 --> 01:00:55,700
ahead. Good idea. The captain
said, except it's too late.

949
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,700
Battalion says we mount out as we are.

950
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:03,560
I'm not about to snarl up with them
on a transfer detail right now.

951
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:08,750
You tell sergeant right that, I'm sorry
we can't do anything for him. I, I sir.

952
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,750
So that was a little opportunity for
sergeant right to get out of there,

953
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:17,810
but it didn't work out.

954
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:25,930
And now just talking about kind of the
morale of the troops back to the book,

955
01:01:26,811 --> 01:01:29,540
there was a great energy in the ranks,
strong,

956
01:01:29,541 --> 01:01:31,640
healthy young men on the way to adventure.

957
01:01:32,510 --> 01:01:36,590
We cleaned and recleaned weapons and
earnestly sharpened our bay and nets and

958
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:37,880
fighting knives.

959
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:43,670
The old salts retold stories of Japanese
ferocity on the Pacific islands. Oh,

960
01:01:43,671 --> 01:01:47,150
there's remembered pitch battle with
the Chinese bandits along with the

961
01:01:47,151 --> 01:01:49,460
pleasures of the north China occupation.

962
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,280
The newly blooded veterans of last
month's fight boasted to the replacements

963
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,790
about their triumphs over
the stubborn North Koreans.

964
01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:03,200
All hand speculated about whether the
quality of the Chinese army would be equal

965
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:05,870
to that of the North Koreans
we had beaten down south.

966
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:11,890
The fear that settles in the gut before
combat had not yet surfaced on that

967
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:15,920
Christmas morning with
our clean shaven faces,

968
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,950
clean dungarees squared
away gear full canteens,

969
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,100
full bellies and full issue of ammunition.

970
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,280
The marines have Baker
one seven feared no one.

971
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,080
They start heading up north
and one of the colonels is out.

972
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,800
Colonel Litson Berg was there.
He stood beside the road as we pass,

973
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:38,400
nodding and smiling at his fighters.
You're looking good marine.

974
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,840
You're looking good marine.

975
01:02:39,841 --> 01:02:43,170
He kept saying and all the men
waved and smiled back at him.

976
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:47,520
The veterans from down South
recognized all recognized old homer.

977
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:51,590
They had seen him frequently up
on the line, good hunting. Owen,

978
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:55,050
good hunting young man.
He called to me as I passed by

979
01:03:02,690 --> 01:03:04,610
now.
He has that opportunity now

980
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:11,200
to maybe figure out a way out for right
who had the opportunity to go away.

981
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:15,770
While the men were loading up on
Ammo. I talked to sergeant, right.

982
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,510
No sense for you to go up.

983
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:20,760
I told him your orders could
come down from battalion anytime.

984
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:22,310
Now stay here with the gunny.

985
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:26,840
I appreciate that lieutenant
responded sergeant. Right,

986
01:03:27,230 --> 01:03:30,920
but I do want to stay with the
mortars if it's okay with you.

987
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:35,150
That's what I'll do. I nodded.
It's okay with me, sergeant.

988
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:40,550
I just don't want you wasting time getting
back to your kids. He said, stiffly,

989
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,930
I'll stay with the section, sir.
He didn't like my favoring him.

990
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,920
He went back to the mortar men and
told them to get ready to move out.

991
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:52,500
Okay.

992
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,410
I'm telling you there's up,
there's a certain bond.

993
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,940
There's a certain bond and obviously
in this case it's a bond that's even

994
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:04,430
stronger than the bond he has with his
kids is the bond that he knows is his

995
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,130
brothers and arms are going into harm's
way and he's going with them no matter

996
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:08,964
what.

997
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:15,150
So now we get a Baker one seven there.

998
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,730
They're dug into some positions,

999
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:19,950
they've moved and now they're
dug into some positions.

1000
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,450
Back to the book in the brush below.

1001
01:04:21,451 --> 01:04:26,451
Kaiser's platoon Chinese assault squads
weighted in silence for the rockets and

1002
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,610
bugles that would signal them to attack.

1003
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:34,380
They're quilted uniforms kept them
from shivering in the chill night.

1004
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:40,230
They already knew in detail how Kaiser's
defenses were set up and the location

1005
01:04:40,231 --> 01:04:42,990
of each forward hole and our weapons.

1006
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,510
During the late afternoon there,

1007
01:04:45,511 --> 01:04:50,370
officers had watched Baker one seven dig
in and they knew our line as well as we

1008
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:53,100
did under cover of darkness,

1009
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:58,020
the assault teams had crept soundlessly
into their jump off positions within

1010
01:04:58,021 --> 01:05:00,060
grenade range of the marine line.

1011
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:05,850
These soldiers were honored that they
would be the first Chinese to attack

1012
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:07,440
American marines.

1013
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:13,360
So these guys are staged
and ready and here we go.

1014
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:16,600
The sound of a rocket ripping
through the year close above us,

1015
01:05:16,601 --> 01:05:20,800
jolted awake and brought me upright
in our whole. Kelly was with me.

1016
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:23,500
A streak of fluorescent
green crossed our line,

1017
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:25,840
followed by a red rocket
from the other direction.

1018
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:30,310
Bugles blared and whistle shrilled
down the suit. Dong Valley.

1019
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:35,670
The luminous hands of my watch says
zero zero three zero Baker one seven was

1020
01:05:36,701 --> 01:05:41,620
under attack. A sudden clamor erupted
from Hank Kaiser side of the hill,

1021
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,750
the Erie chant Molleen die,

1022
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,010
Marlene die issuing from a
chorus of Chinese voices.

1023
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,450
Then the crash of mortars,

1024
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:53,800
the boom who concussion of grenades
and the sharp sputter of Burp guns.

1025
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:59,140
Seconds later there was the deeper sound
of answering marine rifles and bars

1026
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:04,320
joined by the pounding of our machine
guns and the explosion of marine grenades.

1027
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:10,660
The screams of wounded men soon
added to the Malosh of sounds,

1028
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:15,520
along with profanities of
rage in both languages.

1029
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,970
Fast forward a little bit,

1030
01:06:22,971 --> 01:06:26,240
Chinese grenades exploded into
the line and they're burp.

1031
01:06:26,241 --> 01:06:31,100
Guns blazed the first wave of enemy
soldiers rushed in and forward.

1032
01:06:31,101 --> 01:06:34,520
Holes were buried in
mounds of quilted uniforms,

1033
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:38,840
clubbing and stabbing. The Chinese
searched up the third platoons.

1034
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:43,841
Hill behind them were left dead marines
and wounded men who cried for the help

1035
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:45,673
of their Korman.

1036
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:50,000
And one of the things that they talk
about in here is one of the tactics that

1037
01:06:50,001 --> 01:06:55,001
the Chinese used is not everyone would
even carry a weapon when they would

1038
01:06:55,101 --> 01:06:58,970
attack. And if you were a guy that wasn't
carrying a weapon, you would go attack.

1039
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,120
And as soon as someone got shot,
you would take their weapon and carry on.

1040
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:07,370
So that's how, that's how many
people they had. Number one,

1041
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:10,340
they also didn't have, you
know, a weapon for every guy.

1042
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:12,560
Obviously they would have given them,
but they also do, you know what,

1043
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,440
here's the plan. But then think
about how now light you are,

1044
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:18,500
you're not even carrying a weapon. It
even carrying any ammunition or anything,

1045
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,020
you're just, you're just
able to travel. And it's,

1046
01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:25,460
it's hard for people that were
never have never put on gear.

1047
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:29,180
It burdens you down so much, it just
makes you slower and you get used to it.

1048
01:07:29,181 --> 01:07:32,780
Sure. But when you, you can get as used
to it as you want when you take it off,

1049
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:37,010
you feel like superman. Yeah. So
these, these Koreans are f the, sorry.

1050
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,880
The Chinese are feeling like
superman sneaking up into
these positions all quiet.

1051
01:07:40,881 --> 01:07:43,670
They also had real legit winter gear,
at least this group,

1052
01:07:43,671 --> 01:07:45,170
we're going to run into some
groups that didn't have it,

1053
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,610
but they got these nice quilted,
uh, uniforms and jackets.

1054
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,840
So that's they, they're just
bringing it. They're bringing it.

1055
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:55,693
Okay.

1056
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,410
Back to the book.

1057
01:07:57,430 --> 01:08:00,770
Van Winkle ready the marines near
him for the next Chinese attack,

1058
01:08:00,771 --> 01:08:03,260
putting his people into
recaptured fighting holes.

1059
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:08,420
The men stacked Chinese bodies in front
of their holes for greater protection.

1060
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,500
Somebody yelled to van Winkle that
his own shoulder was bleeding.

1061
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,790
The big sergeant felt his arm and found
a Chinese had indeed passed through his

1062
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:17,624
shoulder.

1063
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:20,463
He didn't care.

1064
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:26,700
Nobody near sorry. Nearby a man
on the ground sobbing and shaking.

1065
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:27,653
My Buddy,

1066
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:32,660
my buddy Guccis shot his head clean off
the orange glare of a Chinese grenade,

1067
01:08:33,961 --> 01:08:37,620
illuminated the sobbing marine van
Winkle crawled over to the man,

1068
01:08:37,621 --> 01:08:41,940
grasp his arm saying, come on kid,
come with me, you'll be all right.

1069
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:45,510
He rose from the ground and
pulled the kid up with them.

1070
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:49,803
Leadership

1071
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,900
going forward a little bit.

1072
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,980
Archie van Winkle now found himself on
the lower fringes of the Chinese attack.

1073
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,820
He ignored his wounded shoulder
and fired his car, been one handed.

1074
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:06,380
He called for nearby remains marines to
follow and launched his own attack into

1075
01:09:06,381 --> 01:09:09,560
the flank of the Chinese who
were moving up towards Kaiser.

1076
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:13,580
So you got a guys wounded just picking
up young marines to getting them back in

1077
01:09:13,581 --> 01:09:17,060
the game, firing his rifle with
one hand and leading it up,

1078
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:20,600
leading an attack on the flank of the
Chinese that are attacking his buddy

1079
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:24,570
higher up the hill.

1080
01:09:24,571 --> 01:09:28,800
Gunny foster brought Sherman Richter's
two machine guns from first platoon and

1081
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:31,320
they commenced to pounding
down Kaiser slope,

1082
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,720
withering fire and exploding grenades.

1083
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:38,220
Now from both flanks and above
stymied the Chinese attack.

1084
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,300
There was a series of whistle
signals and the attackers fell back.

1085
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:47,500
They crawled over their dead but pulled
their wounded with them as they backed

1086
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:50,320
down to the bottom of the
hill and into the woods.

1087
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:53,110
They were supported by well directed,

1088
01:09:53,111 --> 01:09:57,010
covering fire and they held
good order as they withdrew.

1089
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,900
When the Chinese were
fighting the off the hill,

1090
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,350
the marine cease their fire
and both marines went silent.

1091
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,450
So the Chinese are also doing cover
and move as they, even as they leave,

1092
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:08,740
as they withdraw,

1093
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,513
they,

1094
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,980
they're,
they're in another little firefight and

1095
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:28,210
oh, when's trying to quickly get
his mortar up and they drop up,

1096
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:30,300
they drop a mortar round.
The way a mortar works,

1097
01:10:30,301 --> 01:10:33,960
you crop the mortar into the round,
into the tube and it fires.

1098
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:38,210
If there's a misfire, it's really,
it's a scary situation because, so if,

1099
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,630
if you drop the mortar into the tube and
it doesn't come out, it doesn't shoot.

1100
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:45,780
Well now you've got a live round.
Yeah, inside the mortar tube.

1101
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:50,370
So you have to literally pick up the
tube and let gravity pull, like let the,

1102
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:55,140
let the mortar round slide out and you
put your hands there to catch it. Yeah.

1103
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:58,600
Wait, why does it explode? It's
not like a timer or nothing and no,

1104
01:10:58,601 --> 01:11:01,860
it's like it's got a little
detonator. Yeah, makes it shoe.

1105
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:03,670
And you've got little propellant,
um,

1106
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:07,020
around the fin that makes
no different ranges.

1107
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:11,230
But essentially you drop this thing in
there and it's supposed to shoot out and

1108
01:11:11,231 --> 01:11:12,064
it,
when it doesn't,

1109
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:16,350
it's a scary because now you've got a
live round inside your mortar tube and in

1110
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:18,000
order to get it out you,
you,

1111
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:22,320
you just lift the mortar
tube up when you've kind of
pour it out into your hands.

1112
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:27,220
So they get a dud round and there's a
bunch of things that can call it cause a

1113
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:30,720
Doug round. Some of it can be, you
know, a bad batch of ammunition,

1114
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:34,920
but that's what's going on here. They get
a dud round, dud round, try another one.

1115
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:37,500
I told [inaudible] again, they're
trying to get some mortars down range.

1116
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:39,780
So they're all in a panic situation and
they're getting shot at, by the way,

1117
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:41,850
to dud round.
Try another one.

1118
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:44,910
I told wing yet Kelly yelled
for us to hurry up wing.

1119
01:11:44,911 --> 01:11:48,000
It asked me to wait while he
checked the tube for an obstruction.

1120
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,000
He grabbed a long stick,
which he shoved into the tube.

1121
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:55,680
He pulled out a cleaning rag.
The cause of our misfire, it was,

1122
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:00,000
it was careless that we had not checked
the tube for an obstruction before we

1123
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:04,620
fired wing. It said, I won't tell
anybody about this if you don't.

1124
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:07,830
And he says, shut up. Damn it.

1125
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,820
I yelled at him and this is the reason
I highlighted this cause he said,

1126
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:14,940
my fear showed itself in anger.

1127
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:19,890
And I think that's an important
thing to think about. We all know,

1128
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:24,180
we all know when someone's
getting mad that,

1129
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:27,110
that they're probably afraid, right?
They're afraid of something that's,

1130
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,590
so we all see that.

1131
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:33,230
So if you're in a leadership position
and you start losing your temper, it's,

1132
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,640
it's very visible to everybody
that you're just scared.

1133
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,710
You might be also frustrated,

1134
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:40,200
but it's showing you what it's showing
is that you're losing control of your

1135
01:12:40,201 --> 01:12:44,130
emotions. And that's why we can't
do that in leadership positions.

1136
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:48,840
Or you can't do that. That's why it's so
much, infinitely better to remain calm.

1137
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,830
Yeah. When, uh,

1138
01:12:52,410 --> 01:12:53,800
flip frustration,
like all the,

1139
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:58,770
so if you go into a situation
where you're scared, you know,

1140
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,821
so a lot of times,

1141
01:12:59,821 --> 01:13:03,360
especially if you're like an Alpha
type person or a powerful person,

1142
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,310
you go and you feel that fear.

1143
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:09,330
It's basically the fear kind of
is this feeling of, of weakness.

1144
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:13,920
So a natural tendency, this goes for
pretty much everybody over natural. Yeah.

1145
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,470
It's the bounce back. So, so you,

1146
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:21,360
your natural way to invoke power is a car,
like this anger,

1147
01:13:21,361 --> 01:13:25,180
aggression type attitude.
So when you know leaders or whatever,

1148
01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:27,300
when they feel that fear,
it's like, oh my powerless.

1149
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:31,110
It's like a subconscious thing.
I'm powerless right now.

1150
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:35,460
So I gotta I gotta fight back. So
comes angry in this point. And,

1151
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:36,390
and the thing is,

1152
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,340
you just said, we all cumins
know that instinctively. Yeah.

1153
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:43,560
So when you see a leader
start to act like that,

1154
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,430
it becomes very clear
that there's some emotion.

1155
01:13:47,431 --> 01:13:51,810
There are some fear or some frustration,
some anxiety, and that's going to spread.

1156
01:13:51,811 --> 01:13:52,500
By the way,

1157
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:55,380
if I start panicking and start getting
crazy jaqual you got to get this done.

1158
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,080
You know I'm scared. So now you're
saying, wait, if chocolates scared,

1159
01:13:58,170 --> 01:14:01,500
I'm scared too.
And now we started having issues.

1160
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:09,480
So try and remain calm is the,
is the basic principle.

1161
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:12,003
So

1162
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:18,390
they get done with that
particular firefight and we
got a little debrief here on

1163
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:22,870
it. Back to the book. Baker one
seven lost more men that night.

1164
01:14:22,871 --> 01:14:27,040
Then we had in the first five days of
our campaign against the North Koreans,

1165
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:31,750
Captain Wilcox raised a hell when he
heard Sergeant Dale and his men had been

1166
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:34,810
killed in their sleeping bags. I didn't
cover this section, but one of the,

1167
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:37,560
one of the small elements,
they were in their sleeping bag,

1168
01:14:37,570 --> 01:14:38,920
she got overrunning killed.

1169
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:42,340
So Captain Wilcox raised hell when he
heard that Sargent Dale and his men had

1170
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:43,810
been killed in their sleeping bags.

1171
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,370
He made it standard operating procedure
that the company stayed out of sleeping

1172
01:14:48,371 --> 01:14:50,890
bags at night.
And when we were on the line,

1173
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:55,660
tell your people that they can put their
feet in the bags and loosened their

1174
01:14:55,661 --> 01:15:00,340
boondockers. That's as far as
they'd go. He told us from then on,

1175
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,320
no matter how cold it became,

1176
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:07,270
we slept outside of our bags and our
boots only came off to change socks.

1177
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,083
Okay.

1178
01:15:12,190 --> 01:15:16,240
Now I didn't cover this
part where this happens,

1179
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:19,900
but one of these guys, Sergeant
Lany, he, he had, he had,

1180
01:15:20,740 --> 01:15:25,360
he had taken a patrol to another area
in one of the mortars and when he went,

1181
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:29,830
they got lost. And then when
they got lost, they got overrun.

1182
01:15:29,831 --> 01:15:32,380
And instead of fighting or doing anything,
they'll just all ran.

1183
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:36,430
They just all ran in different directions.
Now actually, all of them lift miracle,

1184
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,510
all of them lived.
I shouldn't say they got overrun,

1185
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:43,240
but fighting broke out and instead
of doing something organized,

1186
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:47,200
they just all took off.
And so sergeant [inaudible],

1187
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,390
he's, they come back and they say,
what? You know, oh, and says, hey,

1188
01:15:52,391 --> 01:15:54,670
what happened out there? And they
said, Sergeant Loney just, you know,

1189
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:56,800
basically said every man for himself

1190
01:15:58,780 --> 01:16:01,750
and so he's about to get
relieved of his command,

1191
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:06,310
which means you got fired in the military.
Okay, back to the book. Sergeant Lany.

1192
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:10,060
I'm relieving you of your squad.
He looked straight ahead,

1193
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:14,650
but his eyes moistened you let your
men down last night you abandoned your

1194
01:16:14,651 --> 01:16:18,700
responsibilities. It's only good
luck that the squad wasn't wiped out.

1195
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:21,580
They could all be dead or taken prisoner.

1196
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:26,890
Lenny's voice trembled lieutenant. It
was pitch black down there. We were lost.

1197
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:31,210
I use my best judgment. I can
understand getting lost. I said,

1198
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:34,420
but you said no security.
When the Chinese came through,

1199
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:39,421
you forgot to take you forgot
your men to take care of yourself.

1200
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:45,610
Lieutenant. I panicked. I admit that,
but if you give me another chance,

1201
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:48,790
tears streamed down his cheeks
and he looked to the ground.

1202
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:53,830
I can't give you another chance.
Your men don't respect you.

1203
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:58,300
You report to the CP, they'll
give you orders. From there,

1204
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:03,880
his head bowed. Sergeant Lonnie
said, I'm sorry sir, I'm very sorry.

1205
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,080
I'm sorry to sergeant dismissed.

1206
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:11,630
Sergeant [inaudible] walked
back to the section perimeter,

1207
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,170
gathered his gear than
charged up hill to the CP.

1208
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,840
No one's said goodbye to him.

1209
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:24,310
I felt sorry for the man and I couldn't
forget the Times that fear had taken me

1210
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:28,160
close to the edge of panic too.

1211
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,310
That's why I included that because,
oh,

1212
01:17:32,311 --> 01:17:37,311
when who was going through all
kinds of fearful situations,

1213
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:41,850
he knows that he's been close to that
edge, but he doesn't cross the line.

1214
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,710
He holds the line and
that's the difference.

1215
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:52,363
Okay,

1216
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:56,570
now they're pressing forward. Again.

1217
01:17:56,571 --> 01:18:00,890
This entire book is them either pressing
forward or you're going to see quickly

1218
01:18:00,891 --> 01:18:03,050
that it becomes them trying to leave.

1219
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,740
Once they're surrounded back to the book.

1220
01:18:06,741 --> 01:18:11,210
Baker one seven took point and marched
for more than an hour without any sign of

1221
01:18:11,211 --> 01:18:12,170
the Chinese,

1222
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:16,460
a single file of each of
us on the side of the road.

1223
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:20,150
The men moving easily, so they're
pushing forward and nothing's happening.

1224
01:18:20,151 --> 01:18:24,230
All of a sudden
don't like this one damn bit.

1225
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:28,040
Lieutenant Owen O'brian said to me,
he was a reservist,

1226
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:30,560
combat experienced from the Pacific war.

1227
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:34,610
It is unnatural for the Guccis
to let us move up this easy.

1228
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:36,320
We're walking into their trap.

1229
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:43,280
All I know is that Macarthur says the
First Marine Division is going to go for

1230
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:47,510
the Yay Lou Yalu River.
I said,

1231
01:18:47,511 --> 01:18:51,730
the Yalu River was North Korea's
border with China, so they're good.

1232
01:18:51,731 --> 01:18:53,840
They have been ordered. Hey,
you're going to the Yalu River,

1233
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,140
and pretty much they're
all saying at this point,

1234
01:18:57,141 --> 01:19:00,500
they all kind of feel like it's a
trap there, but they're walking.

1235
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,140
They're not getting any resistance.
Back to the book,

1236
01:19:03,141 --> 01:19:04,310
the troops were in good humor.

1237
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,960
They joked and laughed as we marched and
made obscene comments about the things

1238
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:13,070
that were central to their lives.
The Chow, the terrain, the enemy,

1239
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,120
the lack of women.

1240
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:19,670
Second thing I'm going to do when I
see my wife again is take off my pack.

1241
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:25,130
Said one of the married reservists in
the column. Oh yeah. Came the answer.

1242
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:28,610
By the time you see her again,
you'll forget what the first thing was.

1243
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:32,930
Hell, it'll be so long
before we get backstage side.

1244
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:34,940
You'll be too old for that stuff.

1245
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:39,140
Someone else joke to the married
man who is nearly 30 years old.

1246
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:42,773
Yeah.

1247
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:47,440
I'm telling you guys keep up the
good spirits and that is, that is,

1248
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:48,430
it's impossible.

1249
01:19:48,431 --> 01:19:53,290
You know I got include this because
I always had fun on deployments.

1250
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,910
I was saying this the other day,

1251
01:19:54,911 --> 01:19:58,960
we laughed out loud
like once a day in Iraq,

1252
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:01,840
laughed out loud hysterically at something

1253
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,760
so that for those of you
that are civilians or have
any comprehension of this

1254
01:20:09,061 --> 01:20:12,720
kind of thing, guys that are in the
military, they have a good time.

1255
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:16,560
Even in the worst situations
they're having. We have fun.

1256
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:22,140
You have to and you know you can
apply that to your job, to your job.

1257
01:20:22,141 --> 01:20:26,580
When things get stressful, when
things start getting hard as a leader,

1258
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:29,940
if you're just bearing more stress
on everybody, it's not going to help.

1259
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:32,460
One of the best ways to alleviate
stressors, to have some fun,

1260
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,860
and that's exactly what's going on
here. The guys were on patrol. Okay,

1261
01:20:34,861 --> 01:20:36,720
we're not getting shot at.
So guess what?

1262
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,390
Let's bust this guy's ass
about missing his wife.

1263
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,810
No problem at alleviates
some of that stress.

1264
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:47,550
You don't need to just bear down and
create more stress on your people.

1265
01:20:48,370 --> 01:20:50,910
I've been asked that. A couple people
have asked me that on social media.

1266
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:53,060
Can you talk to, can you
tell us about, you know,

1267
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,850
humor in as a leader?

1268
01:20:56,851 --> 01:20:59,550
When do you use humor and
like, yeah, absolutely.

1269
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:04,110
We always have fun and you know,
there's obviously a time to be serious,

1270
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:08,880
but there's plenty of time when you're
going to joke around and have fun and

1271
01:21:08,881 --> 01:21:11,620
poke fun at each other all the time.
Yeah.

1272
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:16,040
Do you ever run into like situations where
you know,

1273
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:19,030
some people they just joke more than
other funeral and then there's the,

1274
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:20,660
you know,
the opposite guys joke class.

1275
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:24,150
You ever run into a situation where
you are serious and then someone's like

1276
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:28,500
trying to make jokes, you know, and, and
it does get annoying or in the way of,

1277
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,340
I don't know that people when,
when I'm serious,

1278
01:21:32,341 --> 01:21:36,430
I don't get a lot of jokesters
and the gate. I, I've, I've just,

1279
01:21:36,670 --> 01:21:39,900
I'm saying most of the time when
I'm, when I mean, and I think,

1280
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:44,910
I think there's a pretty, I mean
maybe that happens in, in, you know,

1281
01:21:44,911 --> 01:21:47,340
in a school setting, you know, or,

1282
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:50,520
or I guess in a business setting it
could happen, but if you've got to,

1283
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:55,180
if you've got a good team that works a lot
together, people, no, it's not, you know,

1284
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,491
and I,

1285
01:21:56,491 --> 01:22:00,780
and once you tell a joke or you crack a
wisecrack and nobody laughs and you just

1286
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:03,870
get a look from people going,
hey man, shut up. That's
it. You know? So maybe I've,

1287
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:06,840
maybe that's happened to me a dozen
times in my career where somebody said

1288
01:22:06,841 --> 01:22:11,480
something, it's, you know, everyone just
said, okay, well you know, enough at area,

1289
01:22:11,481 --> 01:22:13,520
everybody feels it.
Yeah.

1290
01:22:13,620 --> 01:22:17,370
I would imagine to working that close
with important tasks like that important

1291
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:22,110
people are pretty going to be pretty
much in tune with the comedy at dynamic.

1292
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:23,190
Exactly.
Now,

1293
01:22:23,191 --> 01:22:28,191
I had a guy that I worked with when
I was the admiral's aid and he,

1294
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,250
he and I, he was older than me.
He was actually retired captain.

1295
01:22:32,251 --> 01:22:35,940
He's one of my favorite guys, but I was
the admiral's aid. So I was a young,

1296
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,020
you know,
young lieutenant,

1297
01:22:37,021 --> 01:22:41,850
and he was a retired captain and we
would go back and forth all day long,

1298
01:22:41,970 --> 01:22:43,950
regardless of what the situation was.

1299
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,280
We would never say a serious thing to
each other the entire day for months on

1300
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:53,670
end, nothing. Everything was a sarcastic
kind of comment through each other.

1301
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:57,840
And it made a pretty, a pretty
miserable job of being the animals.

1302
01:22:57,841 --> 01:23:02,070
Ate is not a fun job. It made it like we
just had a good time. So, so once again,

1303
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:05,110
we're even in a situation
where, hey, I'm in a uniform,

1304
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:08,470
an office all day from six o'clock in
the morning until seven o'clock at night,

1305
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:13,030
every day, day on day, you know, in
the military and in the civilian world,

1306
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,460
when you come back from a trip from
somewhere, they're like, oh, you, oh,

1307
01:23:15,461 --> 01:23:17,800
you were on a trip. Hey, you know, don't
come in tomorrow morning. You know,

1308
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,960
you can come in a little bit late
because you got back at midnight.

1309
01:23:20,110 --> 01:23:22,540
You heard of your animals. I had no,
you're coming. You're coming in at six.

1310
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:25,210
That's the way it is.
There's no, there's no, Oh,

1311
01:23:25,211 --> 01:23:27,070
you haven't seen your family in two weeks,
so that's cool.

1312
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,960
Could we will see you at six
o'clock in the morning tomorrow. Oh,

1313
01:23:28,961 --> 01:23:32,680
you want to take your daughter to school?
No, not happening. So it's like that.

1314
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:36,610
And yet I had this one guy that
I work with who we, we just,

1315
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:40,660
we just never said anything series to
each other and always kept it light and

1316
01:23:40,661 --> 01:23:45,160
fond and that's, that was pretty awesome.
Was that D, I mean, thinking back,

1317
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:49,540
do you think that that was on purpose
or did it just kind of shake itself out?

1318
01:23:49,541 --> 01:23:53,130
Like it just, you could sell out,
you know, we just said phony. Uh,

1319
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:58,320
the way our relationship was was we were
just two guys that like to give each

1320
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:01,980
other a hard time about stuff and set
each other up for stuff and just, just,

1321
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:05,110
yeah, we both knew. I mean, he was under a
stressful job as well, you know, he's got,

1322
01:24:05,470 --> 01:24:08,410
he's got a lot of pressure on him
and so what are we going to do?

1323
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,630
Sit there and be miserable
all day. No. You know what,

1324
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:13,180
we're going to have a good
time. Even in this, you know,

1325
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:18,210
fairly miserable administrative scenario
that we're living in a good time with

1326
01:24:18,371 --> 01:24:21,760
it because some people do it on
purpose where it's like, oh Dang,

1327
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:24,470
things are getting real tents
here for work or whatever.

1328
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,300
And then they'll throw in jokes. They're
going to be on that fine line between,

1329
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:31,300
okay, you're right now things are
tense. Why'd you say that joke?

1330
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,510
That's inappropriate. And the other
side, which is like it, it helps,

1331
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:36,970
you know saying like
in like this guy and I,

1332
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:41,380
we would be even in the really stressful
situation where no one else was joking.

1333
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,720
I might like,
you know,

1334
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:45,870
shoot him a look across the room
and roll my eyes at him bugging.

1335
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:48,940
You didn't see this coming digit tough
guy and we would just be laughing.

1336
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:52,720
So even in they're really stressful
stuff we would, we would lighten it up.

1337
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:55,900
But that's because, you know, that's
the first time was that we had, yeah.

1338
01:24:57,210 --> 01:25:02,140
All right. Speaking of not no
joke whatsoever. Back to the book,

1339
01:25:02,141 --> 01:25:03,070
major tie.

1340
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:08,071
The operations officer told us that there
were increasing reports of heavy enemy

1341
01:25:08,471 --> 01:25:12,880
concentrations on all sides
of the battalion. However,

1342
01:25:12,970 --> 01:25:17,410
General Macarthur himself was expressing
inpatients with a slow pace made by the

1343
01:25:17,411 --> 01:25:20,680
first marine division and its
progress toward the Chinese border.

1344
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:25,210
The army was trying to light a fire under
General Smith, the division commander.

1345
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,120
So you got the marines are saying,
hey look,

1346
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:33,390
it looks like we're starting
to get surrounded here and
talks a little bit about

1347
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:36,850
this in the book. The marines were
kind of slow rolling. They weren't,

1348
01:25:36,851 --> 01:25:39,460
they weren't making any great effort to
go as fast as they could because they

1349
01:25:39,461 --> 01:25:41,650
felt like they were going to be trapped.

1350
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:43,900
So they weren't trying to
move as fast as they could.

1351
01:25:43,901 --> 01:25:47,320
And Macarthur's general Carthy in Tokyo
by the way, saying, hey, hurry up.

1352
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:49,780
Come on Marines. You know, army
is pushing up there real quick.

1353
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:50,620
What's wrong with you guys?

1354
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,150
But they're starting to get Intel
reports that they're being surrounded.

1355
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:00,430
And Oh by the way, uh, Lieutenant
Lee, who I talked about earlier,

1356
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:02,030
the real by the book guy,
he,

1357
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:06,770
he actually got wounded and when he got
wounded taking the hospital, he went on,

1358
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,500
he went on. He would
absent without leave. Awol.

1359
01:26:09,980 --> 01:26:14,540
You went AWOL from the hospital to
get back to the line. Oh Dad. Yeah.

1360
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:18,770
He's, oh no, I'm fine. My arm can't
move it. Send a slang. Doesn't matter.

1361
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:23,360
I'm going to fight.
And speaking of Lee,

1362
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:27,590
talking about Lees, Lees platoon
here, when they weren't on patrol,

1363
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:32,030
Lee put as men through a rigorous
training program of small unit tactics.

1364
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:36,980
They maneuvered all over the nearby hills
and they bitched at some extra work.

1365
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:38,620
Yeah.

1366
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:42,730
Lee paid little heed to the grumbling.
Soon we will meet the enemy.

1367
01:26:42,731 --> 01:26:47,320
He predicted to his men, we will be
ready. So Lee's a hard ass and his guys,

1368
01:26:47,650 --> 01:26:49,150
everyone else is doing it.
You know, they're, they're,

1369
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,550
they're moving up north and
it was an easy day patrol.

1370
01:26:51,551 --> 01:26:53,770
Cause remember the Chinese aren't
pushing hard against them right now.

1371
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:56,230
So what does he do at night? Oh
guys, we're going to go do some work.

1372
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:57,700
We're going to do some tactical drills.

1373
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:58,703
Hmm.

1374
01:27:00,590 --> 01:27:01,191
Back to the book.

1375
01:27:01,191 --> 01:27:06,191
He was an article of faith with Lee that
combat leadership came from the front.

1376
01:27:07,670 --> 01:27:08,570
In the attack.

1377
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:12,500
He positioned himself with the most
advanced squad just behind the point.

1378
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:18,010
He wore a bright fluorescent pink vest
fashion of cloth panels that he obtained

1379
01:27:18,921 --> 01:27:20,210
from the tactical air team.

1380
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:24,230
The intended purpose of the brilliantly
colored panels was to mark the Ford

1381
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:27,740
extent of our lines for supporting
aircraft. Lee wore his vessel.

1382
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:30,560
That is men could locate him
quickly during a firefight.

1383
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:36,310
He still had a sling on his wounded
right arm and he carried his car being in

1384
01:27:36,501 --> 01:27:37,334
his left hand.

1385
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:41,780
He fired from the hip using it to
shoot tracers that marked sectors.

1386
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:43,860
Okay,

1387
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:47,160
so Lee is just,
I mean a whole nother level,

1388
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,930
whole nother level.
Chu [inaudible],

1389
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,960
that's his full name to [inaudible].

1390
01:27:56,430 --> 01:28:01,170
Now we get into a situation the
Chinese were dug in above Lee.

1391
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:04,020
They had a machine gun
and a line of rifles,

1392
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:07,230
more formal than their
usual defensive formations.

1393
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:11,830
They were expertly deployed below the
crest and their automatic weapons fire,

1394
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,630
short discipline bursts,
tracers, street and bullets.

1395
01:28:15,631 --> 01:28:18,300
And shrapnel swept down the stroke slope.

1396
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:23,220
It took me some time to locate the machine
gun that was giving the most trouble.

1397
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:26,310
When he found that he fired one
handed to put a tracer on it,

1398
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:31,050
his squads moved into skirmish lines and
the NCO sent their own tracers to mark

1399
01:28:31,051 --> 01:28:32,070
for their sectors.

1400
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,810
The bar and grill and Michelle and
rifles followed sending a great volume of

1401
01:28:36,811 --> 01:28:38,700
fire up the slope with the Chinese.

1402
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,790
We waved to me to let me
know the mortar was ready.

1403
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:46,530
I aim to trace her toward the machine
gun and pump my arm four times the signal

1404
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:47,910
for 400 yards.

1405
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:52,080
I saw around leave the tube and following
its path that disappeared over the

1406
01:28:52,081 --> 01:28:53,490
ridge line wing.

1407
01:28:53,491 --> 01:28:56,910
It realized that he was too long
and without need for my correction.

1408
01:28:56,911 --> 01:28:58,050
He came up a turn,

1409
01:28:58,170 --> 01:29:01,440
so he's adjusting the where their where
their mortar rounds hitting his own.

1410
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:04,890
His second round was close and
I waved him to fire. For effect,

1411
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:09,280
we seldom wasted ammo bracketing a target.

1412
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:13,630
AMMO carried up the hills was too
valuable to be wasted on the niceties.

1413
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:17,530
The enemy guns slackened as
WIC as wing it pounded them.

1414
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:22,890
Lee's squad moved upward responding to
the NCO signals with short bounds fire

1415
01:29:23,471 --> 01:29:26,710
team by fire team,
five 10 yards at a dash,

1416
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:31,420
then to ground bearing their enemy on
the bearing fire on the enemy as the next

1417
01:29:31,421 --> 01:29:34,390
fire team winning closer cover move.
It's happening again.

1418
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:38,290
The mortars are covering for them and
then each individual a fire team is

1419
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:39,220
covering for each other.

1420
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:43,990
It was the classic marine rifle tactic
that Lee had drilled into his platoon.

1421
01:29:43,991 --> 01:29:45,490
During this extra training,

1422
01:29:45,491 --> 01:29:49,840
sessions on marine went down and
ride on the ground. The platoons,

1423
01:29:49,841 --> 01:29:53,680
Corman Bill Davis dashed low across the
slope and crashed at the wounded man

1424
01:29:53,681 --> 01:29:56,200
side.
Another marine fell and didn't move again.

1425
01:29:56,530 --> 01:30:00,350
His buddy stabbed the dead man's
rifle into the earth by its bay.

1426
01:30:00,351 --> 01:30:01,990
A Net then continued forward.

1427
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:07,770
The Chinese found it difficult to defend
against Lee's energetic tactics are

1428
01:30:08,411 --> 01:30:11,800
coordinated. Mortar and machine gun
fire kept them pinned to the ground.

1429
01:30:12,430 --> 01:30:16,780
They were no longer able to apply aimed
fire and their effectiveness Dovid

1430
01:30:16,810 --> 01:30:20,440
diminished as our riflemen
pushed closer in on them.

1431
01:30:20,620 --> 01:30:22,360
Cover move it.
By the way.

1432
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:25,750
There's a reason why when I wrote
down the the four laws of combat,

1433
01:30:25,780 --> 01:30:28,780
the number one rule is covering move.
This is why.

1434
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:30,690
Okay,

1435
01:30:30,690 --> 01:30:34,230
lease sent a squad quality crawling
forward into grenade lane range.

1436
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:38,180
I signaled to wing it to cease fire and
the mortar stopped exploding along the

1437
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:39,420
Ford crest of the hill.

1438
01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:43,890
The Chinese soldiers heave the barrage
of their potato masher concussion

1439
01:30:43,891 --> 01:30:45,060
grenades down the slope.

1440
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:48,930
The Marines through or responding
volley are grenades were more powerful.

1441
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:53,790
Filling the air with bits of hot flying
steel. Both sides, dove for holds.

1442
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:57,690
Another volume was thrown.
Lee Ran forward waiving the car,

1443
01:30:57,691 --> 01:31:00,780
being over his head and calling
for his marines to follow.

1444
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:06,060
They search for the top screaming.
They're gung Ho and rebel yells.

1445
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,900
The Chinese withdrew.
They pulled their wounded away,

1446
01:31:09,901 --> 01:31:11,520
but left their dead on the slope.

1447
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:15,270
Lee pushed his men over the ridge line
where they prepared to defend against a

1448
01:31:15,271 --> 01:31:18,990
counter attack.
Lou Puccini stood beside Lee,

1449
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,870
his bar at the ready Lupa
cine had appointed himself.

1450
01:31:21,871 --> 01:31:26,871
Lee's body guard sergeant bond around
the platoon guide rifled through the

1451
01:31:27,361 --> 01:31:31,830
pockets of the dead Chinese gathering
material. For our intelligence people.

1452
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:37,020
I sent Kelly for a detail of the
ammo carriers to bear the casualties.

1453
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:42,410
Bill Davis had two wounded men doped
up with morphine and out of pain,

1454
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:48,410
and there was one marine dead already
covered by his Poncho when he was certain

1455
01:31:48,691 --> 01:31:50,550
that the Chinese would not counter attack.

1456
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:55,700
Lee ordered us off the hill and if
patrol on the return march to the company

1457
01:31:57,391 --> 01:32:02,350
perimeter, no one complained
about lieutenant Lee's
excessive training methods.

1458
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:08,080
He walked along the column and
thank the men for their good work.

1459
01:32:08,850 --> 01:32:09,300
Okay.

1460
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:13,890
I wondered to myself how many firefights
Lee would survive standing at the front

1461
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:17,520
of his troops clad in
that brilliant pink vest.

1462
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:20,273
Okay,

1463
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,080
so the excessive trading,

1464
01:32:23,081 --> 01:32:25,900
everyone's complaining when they're
training and then you get into a firefight

1465
01:32:25,901 --> 01:32:29,500
and everyone's thankful that they
had good discipline leadership.

1466
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,593
No.

1467
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,500
Hmm. A little bit more if we
now this point again, there's,

1468
01:32:38,530 --> 01:32:42,640
they're continuing to get pressed
by the Chinese back to the book.

1469
01:32:42,641 --> 01:32:43,570
More Chinese fired,

1470
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:47,320
broken out far too are right in front
of Lee's in front of Lee's line.

1471
01:32:47,710 --> 01:32:51,310
They fired from a sharp short
hill that rose from the meadow.

1472
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:53,590
We wheeled one of his rifles,

1473
01:32:53,591 --> 01:32:57,140
squads to face the rise and
maneuvered them forward. Burris,

1474
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:01,630
his gun was with we and he traversed the
face of the hill with a cheese before

1475
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,730
the squad moved up.
So cheese is high,

1476
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:08,020
explosive mortars and Burns is is one
of the mortar man and he's covering for

1477
01:33:08,021 --> 01:33:11,680
the movement of Lee as they're
pushing up. The Chinese ceased, fired,

1478
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:13,630
withdrew quickly.
A familiar tactic.

1479
01:33:14,170 --> 01:33:17,890
We stayed with the main body of his
platoon and sent a fire team up to

1480
01:33:17,891 --> 01:33:21,130
reconnoiter the top.
When they reached the top of the rise,

1481
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:26,110
the four men walked along the ridge and
search of the vanished enemy looking up.

1482
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:30,220
Lisa has men silhouetted against the
skyline and yelled for them to get down.

1483
01:33:30,370 --> 01:33:32,560
There were perfectly outlined targets.

1484
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:38,490
The Chinese saw them too and already
had the ridge line registered for their

1485
01:33:38,531 --> 01:33:41,860
mortars, their first rounds,
blue a marine to pieces.

1486
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:44,020
The next barrage claim two more.

1487
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,990
The fourth man dough from
the Ridge and leaped,

1488
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:49,060
rolled and stumbled down the hill.

1489
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:53,800
He came to a halt at the
feet of Lieutenant Lee Lee.

1490
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:58,750
It seen three of his men needlessly
killed and he stood in silent fury.

1491
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:02,740
It's good hand grip. This car been so
tight that his knuckles and went white,

1492
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,580
stupid. He has through his
clenched teeth, stupid,

1493
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:09,370
stupid over and over again,
stupid.

1494
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:13,120
He turned to gene O'Brien,
his platoon sergeant.

1495
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:18,010
See to it that this never happens again.
Sergeant, you tell the men, if you,

1496
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:22,870
if I see another marine on the skyline,
I will shoot him myself.

1497
01:34:24,250 --> 01:34:28,480
We tend at least strode off to be by
himself until his fury and frustration

1498
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:29,470
subsided.

1499
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:34,123
So

1500
01:34:36,290 --> 01:34:39,390
you got guys making big mistakes and
for those either don't understand what

1501
01:34:39,391 --> 01:34:42,750
happened. When you stand up on a
ridge line, you're completely obvious.

1502
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:47,810
It's very clear and Lee's watching this
happen and sees that as guys were a ripe

1503
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:48,954
target.

1504
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:49,890
Okay?

1505
01:34:49,890 --> 01:34:51,990
He's yelling at him,
but it's too late and the mortars hit.

1506
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,103
Hmm.

1507
01:34:54,850 --> 01:34:58,070
Now we get the company
here a little bit for now.

1508
01:34:58,071 --> 01:35:02,420
The company is actually pinned down.
The company's pinned down

1509
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,050
back to the book. When the skipper had
artillery fire control on the radio,

1510
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:12,950
he called in the coordinates,
coordinates for a registration round.

1511
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:19,090
The battery of 105 millimeter howitzers
that supported was dug in a mile and a

1512
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:20,121
half away.

1513
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:24,530
So in a mile and a half away you got these
hundred and five millimeter howitzers

1514
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:26,480
big giant cannons.
Hmm.

1515
01:35:28,660 --> 01:35:29,910
Less than a minute later.
And,

1516
01:35:29,911 --> 01:35:34,480
and you got the company commander that's
calling in calling in to to tell them

1517
01:35:34,481 --> 01:35:35,790
where to shoot.
These cause a mild,

1518
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,790
obviously you can't see there's no
satellite back then you can't see.

1519
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:44,320
So you're just going off of bearing
and distance back to the book.

1520
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:47,410
Less than a minute later we heard the
heavy ripping sound or the first round

1521
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:49,780
cutting the air over our heads.

1522
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,360
It landed a hundred yards of
fronted in front of where Lee,

1523
01:35:52,361 --> 01:35:53,530
the captain and I stood,

1524
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:58,300
stabs of flame flame like
lightening from a black cloud,

1525
01:35:58,301 --> 01:36:02,110
leaped off the ground and we felt
the earth tremble from the explosion.

1526
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,760
Close God to close. Shout at the
skipper, then into the Mikey said,

1527
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:10,420
add three zero zero
repeat ad three zero zero.

1528
01:36:10,600 --> 01:36:14,530
So he's telling them that means add,
it means shoot 300 meters further.

1529
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:20,850
The next round landed further away
and we barely saw the stabs of flame.

1530
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:26,230
It was where the skipper wanted it.
The enemy machine gun fire, it stopped.

1531
01:36:26,380 --> 01:36:31,090
The Chinese knew what would be
coming at them. Repeat Range,

1532
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:35,680
give me concentration.
Fire three volleys on my command.

1533
01:36:36,610 --> 01:36:40,900
The concentration fire would saturate the
area where the Chinese were concealed.

1534
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:45,430
The captain waited to give the order to
fire until sergeant king had positioned

1535
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:50,350
the covering squad in front of us.
Fire 20 seconds later,

1536
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:54,910
the first rounds of the barrage
landed less than 50 yards away.

1537
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,340
Short rounds, meaning that the rounds
didn't go as far as they were supposed to.

1538
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:03,460
We go for the deck.
All of us evenly.

1539
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:07,540
The following rounds dropped
among the front of the squad.

1540
01:37:07,541 --> 01:37:10,240
That first book tune had
position to cover the company.

1541
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:13,480
Withdrawal screams from our own men.

1542
01:37:13,690 --> 01:37:16,450
Mud and flame and crashing funder.

1543
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:21,790
The skipper yelled into the radio,
cease fire, cease fire, short rounds,

1544
01:37:21,850 --> 01:37:26,080
short rounds,
friendly fire.

1545
01:37:27,890 --> 01:37:32,890
The worst thing that can happen in
combat are dismal day turned to horror,

1546
01:37:34,430 --> 01:37:37,470
cries and moons and agonized screams.
Pierce,

1547
01:37:37,471 --> 01:37:40,610
the black smoke that drifted
over the broken ground.

1548
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:43,520
Doc Mickens and Joe King.

1549
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:47,540
We're already working among the
wounded and mangled and dead marines.

1550
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:50,960
Bill Davis and ed topple
the other platoon.

1551
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:55,900
Korman sprinted across the
field to help Captain Wilcox.

1552
01:37:55,901 --> 01:38:00,120
He yelled into the radio as the next line
of shelled has exploded now away from

1553
01:38:00,121 --> 01:38:01,410
us farther to our front.

1554
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:06,420
They'd been in the air before the gunners
could comply with the order to cease

1555
01:38:06,421 --> 01:38:11,370
fire. They did us no further damage, but
there noise added to the hellish scene.

1556
01:38:13,010 --> 01:38:16,080
I arose,
shaken and not sure what to do.

1557
01:38:16,860 --> 01:38:20,220
I saw sergeant right at the edge of the
field and called for him to bring the

1558
01:38:20,221 --> 01:38:24,420
ammo carriers forward. We would use
them to carry the casualties away.

1559
01:38:25,410 --> 01:38:29,520
Joker Saba had already brought the
company headquarters people to lend a hand

1560
01:38:29,521 --> 01:38:30,720
with the grizzly work.

1561
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,920
We had four more dead and three wounded.

1562
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,360
Casaba went to the skipper and said that
we should get the company out of this

1563
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:40,830
place and back down the road.

1564
01:38:42,170 --> 01:38:47,170
Captain shook his head a few times to
clear it at thought about Joe's suggestion

1565
01:38:47,211 --> 01:38:48,500
for several seconds.

1566
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:53,120
Then he got Kaiser Lee on the walkie
talkies and told them to prepare their

1567
01:38:53,121 --> 01:38:54,410
platoons to move back.

1568
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:59,540
He told me to walk a screen of hs 200
yards out to discourage any Chinese from

1569
01:38:59,541 --> 01:39:00,440
following us.

1570
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:04,250
When I reported to him that the mortars
were ready for the fire mission,

1571
01:39:04,670 --> 01:39:07,340
I thought I saw tears
coming down his face.

1572
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:09,770
Although it could have
been the drizzling rain,

1573
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:12,980
eight dead marines for the day,

1574
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:16,310
more wounded and nothing accomplished.

1575
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:20,960
The rain and sleet turned to snow wet,

1576
01:39:20,961 --> 01:39:24,590
sticky stuff that coded the
ponchos covering the dead men.

1577
01:39:25,730 --> 01:39:27,440
The troop struggled down a wet,

1578
01:39:27,441 --> 01:39:31,010
slippery trail to the road
burying the dead and wounded.

1579
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:36,530
They were soaked through and spoke
no words except to blast FIM.

1580
01:39:36,531 --> 01:39:40,040
The God damn fools who sent
us into this miserable, wet,

1581
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:41,870
cold country

1582
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:51,060
friendly fire blue on blue.

1583
01:39:54,270 --> 01:39:55,103
Okay,

1584
01:39:56,690 --> 01:40:00,530
think about it.
Try and keep it in the front of your head.

1585
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:04,760
When you're in combat situations,
try and keep it in the front of your head.

1586
01:40:04,761 --> 01:40:08,120
Try and keep it as a real possibility.

1587
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:13,260
It's not impossible to have it happen
in the end.

1588
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:17,820
It's to kind of like in fighting. When
they say it's the, it's the, it's the,

1589
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,490
it's the punch that you didn't see that
that's the one that's going to knock you

1590
01:40:20,491 --> 01:40:24,540
out. It's the same thing in, in,

1591
01:40:24,690 --> 01:40:29,430
in this situation, if you could see that
a blue on blue is going to take place,

1592
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,030
you would stop it. Yeah.
You can't see it. It's not,

1593
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:36,900
it's something that's going to be
unexpected. That's why it happens.

1594
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:40,820
It happens because it's
unexpected and this one you,

1595
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:44,220
there's a lot of things that can happen
when she started bringing a artillery in.

1596
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,480
There's a bunch of variables there
that are really hard to control,

1597
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:56,110
but it is obviously, it's
a nightmare. It's, it's,

1598
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,530
it's a nightmare in,

1599
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:01,930
I was having this conversation with
one of my seal buddies the other day.

1600
01:41:03,550 --> 01:41:07,690
That's why you train hard.
That's why you prepare for it.

1601
01:41:07,691 --> 01:41:12,691
That's why you create chaos in confusion
inside of your training so that you

1602
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:17,020
actually force blue on blue
force blue on blue is to happen.

1603
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:20,740
You forced these fratricide situations
to happen so that they happen in training

1604
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:22,900
so that they don't happen
on the battlefield.

1605
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,833
Hmm.

1606
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:27,660
It, it it, it's, you know, same
thing with the police department.

1607
01:41:27,661 --> 01:41:28,820
Police Department sometimes has,

1608
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:33,890
has blue on blue train hard set up the
crazy scenarios make people do unexpected

1609
01:41:35,371 --> 01:41:36,204
things.

1610
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:39,640
Okay.

1611
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:40,250
All right.

1612
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:45,050
They come down from that scenario
and they get a day arrest.

1613
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:46,780
You might think, hey,
you know, you took eight,

1614
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:50,030
eight killed and multiple more wounded.
I will give you some time off.

1615
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:52,580
They got time off one day,
one day arrest,

1616
01:41:52,581 --> 01:41:55,190
and then they're back on
the march back to the book,

1617
01:41:55,191 --> 01:42:00,020
the column March North in a cold swirling
wind that swept the road clear of

1618
01:42:00,021 --> 01:42:04,400
snow. We put it on the ponchos
again to help ward off the wind.

1619
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:08,090
They soon fro stiff at
crackled as we walked in.

1620
01:42:08,091 --> 01:42:10,550
If you notice as they
left that other situation,

1621
01:42:11,630 --> 01:42:15,680
the rain turned to sleep in the snow.
So that's like in one hour.

1622
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:18,050
Winter was here and so
now you're going to eat.

1623
01:42:18,051 --> 01:42:20,330
Now you're going to start
hearing about the cold big time.

1624
01:42:21,650 --> 01:42:23,180
The men weren't a foul temper.

1625
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:28,340
What kind of stupid bastards we got
running this goddamn war came from the

1626
01:42:28,341 --> 01:42:31,790
column. Don't worry about them
guys running this goddamn war.

1627
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:35,510
They're sitting by a stove someplace
sticking pins in their maps.

1628
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:40,280
Yeah, and they'll get their pick of
cold weather gear before they send us,

1629
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:41,181
send it up to us.

1630
01:42:41,181 --> 01:42:46,181
Poor suckers guy in the battalion mess
line said them rear echelon bastards are

1631
01:42:46,431 --> 01:42:49,970
already wearing big fur coats
and winter issue. Boat boots.

1632
01:42:51,020 --> 01:42:54,410
That's okay. We'll get the
stuff next spring. Sure.

1633
01:42:54,411 --> 01:42:56,240
What's left of it by
the time it gets to us,

1634
01:42:56,241 --> 01:43:00,530
we'll be needing jungle gear because
these guys are just letting out their

1635
01:43:00,531 --> 01:43:01,700
frustration and anger.

1636
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:07,450
The worst suffering that
day came from our feet.

1637
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,560
We only had thin cotton
socks under the boondockers.

1638
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,120
A little protection from the cold,

1639
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:17,620
especially as they were still
damp under our leggings.

1640
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:20,500
We stomped the way the freezing toes,

1641
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:23,650
the pain of the freezing toes
and kept the blood circulating.

1642
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:26,110
There were complaints of numbness.

1643
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:30,310
Some meant felt as if they
had tables in their socks.

1644
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,280
We didn't know about frostbite.

1645
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:34,173
Yeah.

1646
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:38,870
If you don't know what
boondockers are there,

1647
01:43:38,871 --> 01:43:43,550
your basic like the most
basic form of a boot, leather,

1648
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:46,640
rubber soul. That's it. That's what I,

1649
01:43:46,641 --> 01:43:48,770
that's what boondockers
or they got cotton socks.

1650
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:54,160
Now they get some new gear and then one
of the pieces that they get is called

1651
01:43:55,581 --> 01:43:57,830
shoe packs.
Go into the book.

1652
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:02,480
Shoe packs would change the way we walked
and bring us the crippling scourge of

1653
01:44:02,481 --> 01:44:03,314
frostbite.

1654
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,730
They were big and cumbersome twice
the weight of our boondockers,

1655
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:12,410
they had thick molded rubber
bottoms with heavily cleated souls.

1656
01:44:12,590 --> 01:44:15,500
The tops from the ankle up to the shin.

1657
01:44:15,680 --> 01:44:17,720
We're made of stiff leather.

1658
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:21,710
That lace tightly shoe packs
were clumsy for climbing,

1659
01:44:21,890 --> 01:44:26,600
climbing and slippery on the ice.
The worst thing about them, however,

1660
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:29,390
was that they were laced
when they were laced up.

1661
01:44:29,420 --> 01:44:34,310
No air could circulate on a
steep climb or an a long march.

1662
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:35,720
Our feet would sweat,

1663
01:44:35,721 --> 01:44:40,721
no matter how cold it was when we stopped
moving and the cold said in the sweat

1664
01:44:41,751 --> 01:44:45,260
soaked felt inserts
and socks would freeze.

1665
01:44:46,190 --> 01:44:50,930
Long stretches of wet frozen
feet spelled frostbite.

1666
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,150
I Dunno if you remember this
from the last one we did, but,

1667
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:57,830
and I didn't include it,

1668
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:02,850
but one of the videos that they
showed later to the co two, the, uh,

1669
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:07,160
soldiers and marines that were going over
to Korea was to warn them of frostbite.

1670
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:12,550
And it was the doctors with
the frostbitten feet and
they weren't surgically

1671
01:45:13,491 --> 01:45:17,270
removing the toes. They were just
like, break them off like Eh,

1672
01:45:17,290 --> 01:45:19,550
cause they were just frozen dead
toes and they would just break it.

1673
01:45:19,551 --> 01:45:21,680
That's the video they showed
them. Hey, keep your feet dry.

1674
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:28,120
But it was these poorly designed shoes
was one of the problems that they try or

1675
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:32,060
we make these guys, these super warm
boots doesn't, it's not that easy.

1676
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:34,640
It's not that easy. You make,
I'm so warm and so waterproof.

1677
01:45:34,641 --> 01:45:37,070
No air escapes from him.
Now you've got sweaty feet.

1678
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,300
Now your feet are going to freeze.

1679
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:42,970
Now we get this.
Uh,

1680
01:45:43,020 --> 01:45:46,470
one of the replacements that comes
in is a guy named woody Taylor.

1681
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:49,980
You're going to hear it a little bit
about him and there's a little fire fight

1682
01:45:49,981 --> 01:45:54,630
that takes place. And Captain Wilcox,
who's the company commander maneuvers.

1683
01:45:54,690 --> 01:45:57,660
Some of woody Taylor's guys. He says, Hey,
you guys go check that out over there.

1684
01:45:57,730 --> 01:46:02,280
Mm, woody Taylor doesn't like it.
Those are my men. Says Woody Taylor,

1685
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:07,320
so here we go. Captain Wilcox Taylor
called loudly, loudly to the skipper.

1686
01:46:07,740 --> 01:46:10,200
If you don't I,
I've used the word skipper a bunch.

1687
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:11,850
I should have explained what it is.

1688
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:15,750
Skipper means the commanding
officer of the company, just just,

1689
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:17,070
just like the skipper of a ship.

1690
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:21,030
Captain Wilcox Taylor called
loudly to the skipper.

1691
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,810
He was red faced and out of
breath from the run up the column.

1692
01:46:25,350 --> 01:46:29,070
That's a squad from my platoon. You sent
over there on the flank. Yeah, Lieutenant.

1693
01:46:29,220 --> 01:46:32,220
I saw a few bandits over there.
Captain, those are my men.

1694
01:46:32,340 --> 01:46:36,510
Taylor interrupted my
platoon moves on my orders.

1695
01:46:37,200 --> 01:46:39,600
Captain Wilcox glared
at Lieutenant Taylor.

1696
01:46:40,350 --> 01:46:45,060
I'd seen that cold book many times
before when it had been leveled on me.

1697
01:46:45,720 --> 01:46:50,490
I figured that woody Taylor would not
be long with Baker one seven our new

1698
01:46:50,491 --> 01:46:55,230
lieutenant and the captain stared at each
other. Would he calm down a notch, sir?

1699
01:46:55,260 --> 01:47:00,000
He said, I'd much appreciate it if
you put any orders to my men threw me.

1700
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:05,520
Colonel Davis sent me up here to run
this platoon. That's what I reckon to do.

1701
01:47:06,690 --> 01:47:11,690
Tailoring the skipper war
eyeball to eyeball and the
skipper realize that he had

1702
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:17,580
indeed violated the chain
of command. Yup. Lieutenant.

1703
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:19,740
He said,
you're right.

1704
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:23,760
That's your platoon and I
guess we understand each other.

1705
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:29,220
I guess we do. Captain said Woody
Taylor. All right. Then carry on.

1706
01:47:30,120 --> 01:47:32,250
The skipper dismissed
his new platoon leader.

1707
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:34,500
We figured woody Taylor was going to have,

1708
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,750
what's going to be one hell of a fighter.

1709
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:41,730
He was the last replacement officer to
come to Baker one sever seven and he was

1710
01:47:41,731 --> 01:47:44,640
with us to stay so little stand off,

1711
01:47:45,420 --> 01:47:49,980
but there's a lot of little things
that go on there. Right? Number one,

1712
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:55,610
Taylor was too aggressive out of the gate,
you know, hey, those are my guys. Yeah.

1713
01:47:55,620 --> 01:47:58,650
That was too aggressive. He was able
to catch himself from back off and say,

1714
01:47:58,651 --> 01:47:59,820
hey sir,
I really appreciate it.

1715
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:03,150
If he could come with that attitude
from the beginning, he would have,

1716
01:48:03,940 --> 01:48:08,070
he would have had a better chance of
making what he wanted to have happen with

1717
01:48:08,071 --> 01:48:09,510
no risk.
Cause there was a risk here.

1718
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,520
There was a risk here that
Captain Wilson costumes, you say,

1719
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:15,330
shut up might be your platoon.
It's my, it's my company.

1720
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:18,030
Don't talk to me about this again.
He could've said that,

1721
01:48:18,930 --> 01:48:23,670
but also he's a good leader that
when got pressed on this, he said,

1722
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:27,450
well let me, let me, let me
detach. Instead of getting
mad, he was getting mad.

1723
01:48:27,990 --> 01:48:30,420
He detached. He said, okay, wait
a second. What's going on here?

1724
01:48:30,660 --> 01:48:32,400
This young lieutenant that's
in charge of the tune,

1725
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,700
I just ordered this guys around without
telling him. Now he's mad about it.

1726
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:38,850
Does that make sense? Yes it does.
He's calmed down. He's, he's,

1727
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:42,390
he's talking to me in a better tone now.
He's just asking me.

1728
01:48:42,420 --> 01:48:46,470
He that he's appreciated. I can accept
that. I was a little outlined. Cool. Yup.

1729
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:49,020
You got it.
And they were able to solve that problem.

1730
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:51,630
So just a little little dynamics,

1731
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:54,210
some dynamics out on the
battlefield going on.

1732
01:48:57,420 --> 01:49:01,290
More firefights happen,
more madness going on.

1733
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:06,210
They get through the next situation
and now we have Colonel Davis.

1734
01:49:06,211 --> 01:49:09,270
Again, this is the medal of honor
winner. Who's who's in charge here?

1735
01:49:09,570 --> 01:49:10,201
Back to the book,

1736
01:49:10,201 --> 01:49:13,830
Colonel Davis came up to Baker one seven
to inform us that we were moving out

1737
01:49:13,831 --> 01:49:15,840
again tomorrow morning.

1738
01:49:15,841 --> 01:49:19,380
We would advance up the west
side of the chosen reservoir.

1739
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:23,610
Our objective was the town of you,
dom knee,

1740
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:27,480
14 miles away.
This was not a patrol.

1741
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:32,760
Our battalion commander told us it
was an attack and we should expect the

1742
01:49:32,761 --> 01:49:36,000
fighting to get serious. Right. So they
haven't had any serious fighting, right?

1743
01:49:36,030 --> 01:49:39,000
Oh No, wait. Yes they have, but
expected to get more serious.

1744
01:49:39,270 --> 01:49:42,720
When he finished briefing the officer's
Colonel Davis asked me to bring sergeant

1745
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:43,554
right to him.

1746
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:48,760
The hardship transfer order had finally
come through and our colonel wanted to

1747
01:49:48,761 --> 01:49:51,490
say goodbye personally
to a good marine NCO.

1748
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:54,070
It was a great moment for sergeant.
Right.

1749
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:58,570
All the company officers were there and
the colonel expressed his appreciation

1750
01:49:58,571 --> 01:50:00,520
and best wishes to my departing sergeant,

1751
01:50:01,030 --> 01:50:03,880
Captain Wilcox and lieutenants
added their own well dones.

1752
01:50:04,030 --> 01:50:07,090
Sergeant [inaudible] had done a good
job of whipping the mortar section into

1753
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:08,740
shape and keeping them squared away.

1754
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:13,210
The mortars had a for farewell party
for their sergeant who had been up with

1755
01:50:13,211 --> 01:50:15,070
them since the first
day at Camp Pendleton.

1756
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:20,470
The rifle platoon Corman came by Mickens
and Davis and topple each bringing a

1757
01:50:20,471 --> 01:50:22,900
canteen of sick bay alcohol.

1758
01:50:23,680 --> 01:50:28,680
The skipper and joker Saba joined us in
for a few tastes toast when he was ready

1759
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:32,110
to leave weapon and gear all
squared away like a proud,

1760
01:50:32,350 --> 01:50:35,200
like a parade ground marine
sergeant right approached me.

1761
01:50:35,680 --> 01:50:40,270
His eyes glistened probably mine did too,
sir.

1762
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:42,310
I think we did some
good with these people.

1763
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:45,370
I want to thank you for giving me
a chance to serve in your outfit.

1764
01:50:46,270 --> 01:50:49,990
Thank you surgeon, right?
You're a four five marine NCO.

1765
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:53,280
God bless you and your family sergeant,
right.

1766
01:50:53,281 --> 01:50:55,660
Snap the saluted me and strode off.

1767
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:01,710
I would never see him again and I
would miss him very much to sergeant.

1768
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:06,540
Sergeant right headed home,
our guests.

1769
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:10,740
It was his time and he'd pushed on when,

1770
01:51:10,741 --> 01:51:13,260
when he could have gone
home a lot earlier,

1771
01:51:13,261 --> 01:51:16,020
but he pushed on and now they're getting
ready to make this next move and it,

1772
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:20,070
and he has his orders now in hand
in a orders or orders. So we hit up

1773
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:22,461
back to the book.

1774
01:51:22,461 --> 01:51:26,600
The weather turned ugly again as we
formed up to reserve resume the attack to

1775
01:51:26,601 --> 01:51:31,010
the north, a bitter cold wind
greeted us, filled with a stinging,

1776
01:51:31,011 --> 01:51:34,040
gritty snow.
It was my birthday.

1777
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,830
After the troops were squared away,

1778
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:40,610
I crouched in the ditch alongside the
road and took some time to go through my

1779
01:51:40,611 --> 01:51:41,600
snapshots.

1780
01:51:42,620 --> 01:51:47,620
I thought a Dorothy teaching the happy
birthday song to the babies and how they

1781
01:51:47,781 --> 01:51:48,620
would try and sing it.

1782
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:54,910
I saw their little pink cheeks and
blue eyes and Dorothy's golden hair,

1783
01:52:01,530 --> 01:52:03,210
rough way for him to spend his birthday.

1784
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:08,520
And as you sit here today,
wherever you're listening to this,

1785
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:13,440
know that somewhere in the world there's
an American servicemen that's out there

1786
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:15,690
celebrating their birthday
in a similar manner.

1787
01:52:15,691 --> 01:52:19,680
I guarantee it away from his
family and his loved ones.

1788
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:27,320
What else does he get out for his
birthday? He gets some enemy activity.

1789
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:29,780
Back to the book.
The enemy fire became heavy,

1790
01:52:29,930 --> 01:52:34,670
about 50 Chinese were dug in against us
and they were serious about defending

1791
01:52:34,671 --> 01:52:39,470
this place. Lee took his platoon off
the road to extend our firing line.

1792
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:43,670
Captain Wilcox came forward with Garcia
and the big radio and set up in the

1793
01:52:43,671 --> 01:52:47,420
ditch just behind I marvel.
That is easy.

1794
01:52:47,421 --> 01:52:51,410
Ambling gait during firefights,
he always stood up straight.

1795
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:53,360
It's like JP,

1796
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:59,650
the static of the SCR 300 radio out at
added to the pounding of our own machine.

1797
01:53:00,531 --> 01:53:02,240
Guns and bars.

1798
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,050
Rifles cracked Johnson's
mortar thumped out.

1799
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:11,070
Eight gs and enemy bullets zing through
the year and spun off chips of boulders.

1800
01:53:12,350 --> 01:53:15,320
Soon came the urgent cries.
Korman Oh God.

1801
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:20,321
Corpsman and the fear came as it did
to me on the onset of every fight.

1802
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:25,640
The corpsman cries the booming
explosions and the wine of bullets.

1803
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,780
Blood trenched Parker's dear God,
not this time please.

1804
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:35,110
Platoon sergeant king from Taylor's
platoon crouched among some large boulders

1805
01:53:35,111 --> 01:53:35,740
above me.

1806
01:53:35,740 --> 01:53:39,050
He shouted down that there was a machine
gun near the spike of rocks that mark

1807
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:40,450
the Chinese main position.

1808
01:53:41,260 --> 01:53:44,590
I willed myself to climb
up and get a better look.

1809
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:48,880
The fears submerged and
the cold was forgotten.

1810
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,460
Overcome that fear.
Take action.

1811
01:53:55,020 --> 01:53:55,530
Okay,

1812
01:53:55,530 --> 01:54:00,300
now they continue in this little fire
fight and then finally we get enough

1813
01:54:00,301 --> 01:54:04,220
talked about them before we get some
air support's marine corps support.

1814
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:06,540
We've got some marines on
the ground that are pilots.

1815
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:10,530
What we now call Anglico.
The marines are on the ground.

1816
01:54:10,531 --> 01:54:14,850
These are fighter pilots that go out
and do infantry work and call for fire.

1817
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:16,440
And so here we go.
Back to the book,

1818
01:54:16,441 --> 01:54:20,160
Bob Wilson brought in the course errors
that were on station to cover our

1819
01:54:20,161 --> 01:54:20,994
advance.

1820
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:24,690
I called down to burst to laid down
around of white phosphorous to mark the

1821
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:28,500
Chinese guns and the flyers came
in on the column of white smoke.

1822
01:54:28,920 --> 01:54:31,320
They flew in low, barely above, above us.

1823
01:54:31,590 --> 01:54:36,590
They're great racketing noise overpowered
all other sounds as they flashed by on

1824
01:54:37,171 --> 01:54:39,720
the first pass, as they fired
the machine guns and cannons.

1825
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:42,930
These had a little effect. The
Chinese were dug in to, well,

1826
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:46,710
they followed with a napalm run,
a spectacular,

1827
01:54:46,740 --> 01:54:50,010
a spectacle of awesome
and terrible beauty.

1828
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:55,320
The pod slid from the plains,
tumbled across the ground that exploded.

1829
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:56,970
Black smoke,

1830
01:54:56,971 --> 01:55:01,650
billowed and red flame leaped against
the white snow and seconds later we felt

1831
01:55:01,651 --> 01:55:05,430
the blast of heat that consume
the ground 200 yards away.

1832
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:10,710
Chinese soldiers were a flame
running about and frenzied circles.

1833
01:55:11,370 --> 01:55:16,350
They threw themselves flailing into
the snow. There was sudden silence.

1834
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,980
The Chinese ceased fire and
our own weapons were quiet.

1835
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:25,230
We were stoned by the power of
that close end flaming strike.

1836
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:27,160
Okay,

1837
01:55:27,160 --> 01:55:31,960
200 yards away. That's not a big distance.
That might seem like a big distance.

1838
01:55:31,961 --> 01:55:35,440
That is not a big distance when you're
in an airplane and you're coming down to

1839
01:55:35,441 --> 01:55:39,430
drop napalm and kill a bunch of people.
So that's a tiny distance.

1840
01:55:40,270 --> 01:55:44,880
Marine Corps pilots just getting after it.
It's called danger close by the way.

1841
01:55:45,060 --> 01:55:48,870
So if you're going to call in an
airstrike that's close to your positions,

1842
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:52,470
you have to say on the radio, you
say danger close, meaning look,

1843
01:55:52,471 --> 01:55:55,130
I know it's close by and you
got to do it right, right

1844
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:03,300
go. And so they, they, they sniffle
out that one. But guess what? The,

1845
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:06,420
the Chinese are far from
done back to the book.

1846
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:09,390
The Chinese showed that they would not
hibernate from the war because of the

1847
01:56:09,391 --> 01:56:13,830
cold weather. The farther we advanced,
the stiffer was there resistance.

1848
01:56:14,220 --> 01:56:18,420
The hills continued to grow steeper and
each climb we made encumbered with the

1849
01:56:18,421 --> 01:56:21,090
heavy clothing became its own or deal.

1850
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:27,020
Most of our fights were platoon sized
Kaiser or Lee or tailor maneuvering up a

1851
01:56:27,121 --> 01:56:32,121
Slippy slippery snow covered slope to
dislodge a force of Chinese who fired at

1852
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:35,250
us down the road.
So as they're moving down this road,

1853
01:56:35,251 --> 01:56:37,920
they're just having to go into the high
ground all the time and take out the

1854
01:56:37,921 --> 01:56:41,660
Chinese.
Here's a,

1855
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:45,350
here's a cool little anecdotal story.

1856
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:50,500
They get pinned down and Colonel Davis
is there and they're trying to figure out

1857
01:56:50,511 --> 01:56:52,430
what to do.
I'm going to the book.

1858
01:56:52,820 --> 01:56:55,580
Colonel Davis was at the head of
our column with Captain Wilcox.

1859
01:56:55,610 --> 01:56:59,900
When the Chinese opened up from
across the Chaz. I'm 300 yards away.

1860
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:05,000
The skipper called me upfront.
Can you knock out those
guns? Captain Wilcox asked,

1861
01:57:05,630 --> 01:57:09,890
he in the kernel crouched
their acknowledgement of
machine gun slugs that torn

1862
01:57:09,891 --> 01:57:11,870
to the slope above our heads.
Yes sir.

1863
01:57:12,290 --> 01:57:14,930
I answered crouching
alongside my two commanders.

1864
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:19,370
So there's a machine gun up on the hill
and they can't get it with their guns,

1865
01:57:19,371 --> 01:57:20,480
but they want him to get his,

1866
01:57:20,600 --> 01:57:23,600
his mortar tubes up there and
then drop mortar rounds on the,

1867
01:57:23,601 --> 01:57:27,980
on the machine gun position. So he yells
out to his runner. So he's runners,

1868
01:57:27,981 --> 01:57:30,200
just the guy that spreads word.
He runs out to his,

1869
01:57:30,290 --> 01:57:34,940
his runner Kelly bring up Johnson's gone.
I commanded Hugo was with,

1870
01:57:35,230 --> 01:57:38,540
uh, Kaiser's platoon
leading the column that day.

1871
01:57:39,140 --> 01:57:40,460
They were just behind the bent.

1872
01:57:40,550 --> 01:57:44,120
I Sir snapped my runner in a
way to impress the colonel.

1873
01:57:44,810 --> 01:57:48,140
Colonel Davis and Captain Wilcox
continued to scan the opposite slope.

1874
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:52,480
11 o'clock said the kernel indicating
slight movement and an outcropping of bowl

1875
01:57:52,510 --> 01:57:54,620
of boulders. Yes, sir. I have it.

1876
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:57,950
I told my carnal as I located the enemy
machine gun through my own binoculars

1877
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:02,030
and another one at 10 o'clock,
50 yards higher, sir. Good eyes.

1878
01:58:02,031 --> 01:58:06,410
Lieutenant said Colonel Davis,
there was a sudden commotion behind us,

1879
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:11,030
the sound of marine singing as
they doubled timed up the road,

1880
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:16,270
Kelly was leading the mortar men forward
and he had them sounding cadence with

1881
01:58:17,451 --> 01:58:21,440
his parody of an army marching song,
song, marching songs sound off.

1882
01:58:22,190 --> 01:58:27,190
How can a mortar man survive following
a man who's six foot five sound off puts

1883
01:58:27,891 --> 01:58:32,660
your rifles and machine guns away. The
60 mortars are all in the way. Sound off,

1884
01:58:32,661 --> 01:58:35,530
sound off?
So they're in a firefight,

1885
01:58:35,670 --> 01:58:38,960
they're pin down and these guys come
running up the road singing cadence.

1886
01:58:38,961 --> 01:58:42,190
And by the way, I forgot to mention
this, that Owen is six foot five. So he,

1887
01:58:42,191 --> 01:58:46,630
that's who they're talking about.
There was no ditch.

1888
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,560
So Hugo could not take cover from
enemy fire while setting up his gun.

1889
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:55,240
He and Dean Westburg spread the bi-pod
on the rear of the rear edge of the flat

1890
01:58:55,241 --> 01:58:59,320
open road surface. I stood behind
the gun as they work quickly,

1891
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:03,940
the volume of bullets increased.
11 o'clock you go. I said,

1892
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:07,900
give me three five zero.
I fired a tracer from my shoulder.

1893
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:12,550
Westburg had a mortar round ready?
You go with his sharp shooters.

1894
01:59:12,551 --> 01:59:17,050
I spotted the target and said
three five Oh, plus a hair.

1895
01:59:17,620 --> 01:59:21,220
He laid the tube in the direction of
the machine gun and cranked is elevation

1896
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:25,660
fire. He said to Westburg, the round
thumped out and we followed its arc,

1897
01:59:25,661 --> 01:59:28,780
ignoring the Chinese bullets that were
bouncing off the frozen surface of the

1898
01:59:28,781 --> 01:59:32,710
road and the slope behind us.
The first round was a direct hit.

1899
01:59:33,280 --> 01:59:36,760
God bless you. You Go.
Johnson, captain will.

1900
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:39,820
Wilcox called out for the
platoon to continue the march.

1901
01:59:39,940 --> 01:59:42,640
Colonel Davis approached the gun.
He had a big smile.

1902
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,130
You tell your men they're
shooting is right on lieutenant.

1903
01:59:45,131 --> 01:59:49,810
He said he glanced at our choir director,
Kelly and added,

1904
01:59:49,990 --> 01:59:52,300
but tell them that they're
singing is way off key.

1905
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:59,860
Like I said, even having a good
time in madness of firefights.

1906
02:00:00,070 --> 02:00:01,990
The cold is getting brutal.

1907
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,800
Back to the book we seldom removed are
knitted gloves that we wore under the

1908
02:00:05,801 --> 02:00:10,600
canvas. Mittens. Bare fingers we found
froze to metal. They froze to weapons.

1909
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:14,770
Bayonets buckles, whatever
we touched. The cold,

1910
02:00:14,771 --> 02:00:17,560
forced a corpsman to change
their way of doing business.

1911
02:00:18,130 --> 02:00:20,220
With the first sounds of a firefight,

1912
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:23,890
they would take several Seretse of
morphine and put them into their mouths.

1913
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:28,720
This kept the morphine liquid until the
Seretse word jabbed into the wounded

1914
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:31,030
mans flesh to relieve his pain.

1915
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:36,490
The corpsman were the only ones who
worked with bare hands in the severe cold

1916
02:00:36,610 --> 02:00:40,600
and they found a way to keep their
fingers nimble while attending two wounded

1917
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:41,434
man,

1918
02:00:41,830 --> 02:00:46,830
the heat of the man's blood did the trick
or his guts as they were stuffed back

1919
02:00:47,111 --> 02:00:48,100
into his belly

1920
02:00:56,210 --> 02:00:57,560
freezing cold

1921
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:04,400
back to the book. Despite our efforts
to keep the men and clean dry socks,

1922
02:01:04,401 --> 02:01:08,990
we were losing the fight
against frostbite, which
resulted from damp, cold feet.

1923
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:14,120
Med would complain of pains or numbness
in their feet and when they limped badly,

1924
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:18,140
we sent them to battalion aid station.
Many never return.

1925
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:23,300
Some waited too long to turn themselves
in and by the time the doctor saw them,

1926
02:01:23,420 --> 02:01:28,040
their toes had become purplish black.
It had to be amputated

1927
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:32,690
because the ground was
frozen hard digging,

1928
02:01:32,691 --> 02:01:34,850
good fighting halls was nearly impossible.

1929
02:01:35,660 --> 02:01:40,660
Digging in became a matter of chipping a
shallow in the unyielding earth beneath

1930
02:01:41,541 --> 02:01:45,320
the snow than barricading it
with rocks or tree bridges.

1931
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:46,550
Okay.

1932
02:01:46,550 --> 02:01:48,740
If any dead Chinese
were found on the hill,

1933
02:01:48,920 --> 02:01:52,580
we added they're stiff
corpses to the barricades.

1934
02:01:53,540 --> 02:01:54,010
Yeah,

1935
02:01:54,010 --> 02:01:55,960
to make level places for their guns.

1936
02:01:55,961 --> 02:02:00,961
The mortar men took turns at the concrete
like dirt within trenching tools and

1937
02:02:01,271 --> 02:02:02,440
combat knives

1938
02:02:06,650 --> 02:02:07,483
and

1939
02:02:08,540 --> 02:02:11,480
they're continuing in this freezing cold.

1940
02:02:12,950 --> 02:02:15,800
They get to a point where there

1941
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:20,160
in sort of an open area,

1942
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:24,600
and we'll go to the book that Chinese
maneuvered down from the ridge lines all

1943
02:02:24,601 --> 02:02:28,230
around us.
They ran across the snow in squad columns.

1944
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:32,400
Then foreign firing lines among
the boulders or prone in the snow.

1945
02:02:33,570 --> 02:02:37,170
Chinese mortars began
to fall on us in the CP,

1946
02:02:37,200 --> 02:02:42,060
which was 50 yards or oss and the CPU,
which was 50 yards behind us,

1947
02:02:42,330 --> 02:02:45,930
around, exploded close by
and lifted me off the ground.

1948
02:02:46,110 --> 02:02:49,440
I was dazed for a while and
went full awareness returned.

1949
02:02:49,530 --> 02:02:54,000
Kelly had me by the arm leading me toward
the CP. Where are we going to Kelly?

1950
02:02:54,420 --> 02:02:56,910
I didn't understand why we were
heading away from the line.

1951
02:02:57,420 --> 02:03:00,810
Get a corpsman to look at you.
I thought you were gone or back there.

1952
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:05,250
He pointed to my park of flapping around
my knees. It adds shrapnel holes in it.

1953
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:08,880
They don't get closer than
that to tearing your balls off.

1954
02:03:08,940 --> 02:03:10,920
It's a good thing you
got me around lieutenant.

1955
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:16,260
The corpsman at the CP was far too busy
with the seriously wounded to tend to my

1956
02:03:16,261 --> 02:03:20,670
mild concussion, the casualties
laying blanket covered rose,

1957
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:26,640
doc, Torsky, Davis and topple. Those are
the corpsman went from one to the other.

1958
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:31,110
They jabbed morphine, slowed bleeding,
cleaned out holes, blasted in Flash,

1959
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:33,720
patched them and wrap
them as best they could.

1960
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:38,790
The corpsman had their mouth filled with
mouth filled with Seretse of morphine

1961
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:42,750
and their bare hands were bloody.
When they worked with the WWE,

1962
02:03:42,751 --> 02:03:45,230
they worked with enemy mortars,
exploding bullets,

1963
02:03:45,231 --> 02:03:48,540
stabbing the air two feet above them.
Weak,

1964
02:03:48,600 --> 02:03:50,730
frightened voices called for their help.

1965
02:03:51,870 --> 02:03:54,540
Doc Mickens from first
platoon took some shrapnel,

1966
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:59,690
then a 25 that a slug in the leg where
he was patching the wounded in action on

1967
02:04:00,691 --> 02:04:03,180
woody Taylor's line.
This stretcher bearers,

1968
02:04:03,181 --> 02:04:07,860
drag Mickens to the CP and laid him
in the line of casualties next to him

1969
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:12,690
damning the Chinese and his Arkansas
drawl was sergeant king who had been

1970
02:04:12,691 --> 02:04:15,060
blasted by grenades and hit by a burp gun.

1971
02:04:15,900 --> 02:04:20,900
Paul Renden on machine gunner with the
platoon lay there to a leg shot up the

1972
02:04:21,961 --> 02:04:25,950
first platoons rapid. The first
platoon was being rapidly depleted,

1973
02:04:25,980 --> 02:04:30,360
depleted and was having a hell of a
fight holding their end of the perimeter.

1974
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:36,990
So these guys were, you had
a perimeter, like I said,

1975
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:39,740
sort of an open area in the Chinese,
just calm down in there, you know,

1976
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:44,340
full on attack on them,
full on back to the book.

1977
02:04:44,400 --> 02:04:48,030
The afternoon light faded and we worried
about whether the AMA would run out.

1978
02:04:49,050 --> 02:04:51,630
The Chinese said fully encircled us.

1979
02:04:51,870 --> 02:04:54,960
Their volume of fire was just
enough to keep us pin down.

1980
02:04:55,650 --> 02:04:59,640
They would wait for dark
than swarm over our lines.

1981
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:02,310
They had plenty of people to do the job.

1982
02:05:03,410 --> 02:05:06,720
Our band nets were fixed
and our grenades ready.

1983
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:12,180
Every man had a target sector and we
kept fire discipline to conserve ammo.

1984
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:16,350
We began to settle in and wait for dark.

1985
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:17,780
Okay.

1986
02:05:17,780 --> 02:05:21,890
As bullet zinged grenades exploded
and marines cried for help.

1987
02:05:22,010 --> 02:05:24,860
Someone yelled out that cop,
Captain Wilcox had been hit.

1988
02:05:25,370 --> 02:05:29,600
He taken a bullet to the face and a
piece of shrapnel and shattered his arm.

1989
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:32,870
Joker Saba took over as our skipper.

1990
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:34,040
Okay.

1991
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:37,550
As soon as we heard about the captain,
we ran to the CP. We found him there.

1992
02:05:37,551 --> 02:05:40,400
His head wrapped in a big
white ball of a bandage,

1993
02:05:40,430 --> 02:05:44,870
unable to speak his blood soaked
sleeve dangled beside him.

1994
02:05:45,590 --> 02:05:47,840
He kept struggling to get on his feet.

1995
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:51,380
When the docs put him down
on his spread out Poncho.

1996
02:05:51,980 --> 02:05:56,690
After awhile the morphine kicked in and
the skipper nodded off groaning softly

1997
02:05:58,370 --> 02:06:01,790
before they stabilize the line
around us. The Chinese, of course,

1998
02:06:01,791 --> 02:06:05,810
the first platoon back almost to the CP.
So you got the platoons.

1999
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:10,610
The CP is the, is the kind of
like the brains of the unit,

2000
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:11,001
right?

2001
02:06:11,001 --> 02:06:15,030
They got the different platoons are out
in the perimeter in 360 degrees and in

2002
02:06:15,031 --> 02:06:17,810
in the center of that, you've
got the command post, the CP,

2003
02:06:18,350 --> 02:06:20,090
and you have the radio men in there.

2004
02:06:20,150 --> 02:06:21,920
You have the people that are
going to do fire support,

2005
02:06:21,980 --> 02:06:23,630
maybe the mortar sections in there,

2006
02:06:24,290 --> 02:06:27,050
and then you have the
leadership is in that CP.

2007
02:06:27,051 --> 02:06:29,330
But now we start to see that the,

2008
02:06:29,331 --> 02:06:32,240
the platoons are getting
pushed back towards the CP.

2009
02:06:32,241 --> 02:06:33,470
They're losing their perimeter.

2010
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:38,960
Just as Joe Casaba came in to
take over command of the company.

2011
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:42,560
What he tailors stormed in demanding
that we get the hell Outta here.

2012
02:06:42,620 --> 02:06:46,010
The geeks have all the high ground.
They got us surrounded, he boomed.

2013
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:48,140
They're going to pick
us to pieces tonight.

2014
02:06:49,250 --> 02:06:51,590
Joker Saba answered him quietly.

2015
02:06:52,730 --> 02:06:55,010
We need air support to
run interference for us.

2016
02:06:55,190 --> 02:06:57,170
Then we might be able to
make a break for the road.

2017
02:06:57,800 --> 02:06:59,840
The better get to work mighty fast.
Said woody,

2018
02:07:00,110 --> 02:07:02,180
we only have a few
minutes of daylight left,

2019
02:07:02,300 --> 02:07:07,100
so there's joker Sabas keeping it
cool again. World War II vet now,

2020
02:07:07,190 --> 02:07:08,910
just out here getting after it.
Yeah.

2021
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:12,093
And

2022
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:13,521
that's what they need.

2023
02:07:13,521 --> 02:07:15,680
So what they need is they need
the course errors to come in,

2024
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:19,040
which if you don't know what a Coursera
course, there's an awesome aircraft,

2025
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:23,420
World War II vintage and you can tell
them cause they have very distinctive

2026
02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:28,400
wings that have a distinctive
bend in them. And they're very uh,

2027
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:32,600
very distinctive looking aircraft and
obviously very good at at close air

2028
02:07:32,601 --> 02:07:37,090
support. Back to book all
afternoon, Joe Hedrick,

2029
02:07:37,210 --> 02:07:41,350
the air controller had attempted to get
a piece of the air support dedicated to

2030
02:07:41,351 --> 02:07:42,141
the fifth marine.

2031
02:07:42,141 --> 02:07:45,760
So there was aircraft working on another
group of Marines working for another

2032
02:07:45,761 --> 02:07:48,790
group of Marines.
Now in the remaining minutes of daylight,

2033
02:07:48,791 --> 02:07:52,180
he caught a flight of four course
errors in search of action.

2034
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:59,630
Then he calls those things in, gets,
gets them on the horn, calls him in.

2035
02:07:59,810 --> 02:08:00,411
And here we go.

2036
02:08:00,411 --> 02:08:04,580
The four Coursera street in Lowell above
us pointing themselves at the Chinese

2037
02:08:04,581 --> 02:08:07,190
position less than a hundred yards away.

2038
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:13,220
They dropped their big earth shaking
bombs and they SCADE the long deep valley

2039
02:08:13,221 --> 02:08:15,620
with rockets and heavy caliber slugs.

2040
02:08:16,310 --> 02:08:19,340
The Chinese took cover and we moved out.

2041
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:23,480
So that's covered. Move. Once again,

2042
02:08:23,810 --> 02:08:25,880
all they needed to do to get
out of this situation with,

2043
02:08:25,881 --> 02:08:27,530
they needed someone to
cover for their movement.

2044
02:08:27,560 --> 02:08:30,050
That's what they needed and they couldn't
supply it themselves because they're

2045
02:08:30,051 --> 02:08:32,720
shooting uphill,
didn't have the firepower income,

2046
02:08:32,721 --> 02:08:37,721
the corsairs to get after it and give
them cover to move back to the book I lost

2047
02:08:39,201 --> 02:08:41,650
ground in that day.
The Lad who,

2048
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:44,210
who had tried hard to
be a good combat marine,

2049
02:08:44,630 --> 02:08:47,690
he was running toward me carrying
a helmet filled with grenades,

2050
02:08:47,691 --> 02:08:50,870
taken from the wounded when a
bullet tore through his throat.

2051
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:54,170
The shot didn't knock him down at first,

2052
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:58,190
just threw his head back and I saw a
fountain, a blood spurt from his neck.

2053
02:08:59,030 --> 02:09:02,840
He staggered a few steps,
then fell face forward and the snow,

2054
02:09:02,930 --> 02:09:06,620
which quickly turned red.
When I got to him,

2055
02:09:06,830 --> 02:09:08,060
he was already dead.

2056
02:09:10,530 --> 02:09:15,530
It took hours more for Baker one seven
to make its way the mile down the road.

2057
02:09:16,740 --> 02:09:20,100
Colonel Davis brought elements of
Charlie company out to meet us.

2058
02:09:20,340 --> 02:09:24,810
We loaded our dead and wounded on
waiting trucks and sent them back to you.

2059
02:09:24,811 --> 02:09:29,130
Dom knee. The Chinese had caught
off the MSR. That's a myth.

2060
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:32,910
That's a main supply route
between you domini and Haga.

2061
02:09:32,911 --> 02:09:35,190
Rury the colonel informed us,

2062
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:40,640
so now they are truly trapped on
the march back into the U. Dot.

2063
02:09:40,650 --> 02:09:43,680
Omni perimeter past midnight,
the men were silent,

2064
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:45,810
spent from this cold,

2065
02:09:45,811 --> 02:09:50,811
brutal day and Captain Wilcox had been
a good skipper and when they get there,

2066
02:09:55,080 --> 02:09:59,790
Lee was waiting for us. When we
staggered into you dumb knee perimeter,

2067
02:10:00,510 --> 02:10:05,130
many of the men limped with the first
stages of frostbite and there were some

2068
02:10:05,131 --> 02:10:07,950
walking wounded who had elected
this stay with the company.

2069
02:10:09,150 --> 02:10:14,150
Undisguised tears ran down Lee's face
when he saw the column make its way in.

2070
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:22,100
And that was the reason that Lee wasn't
with them was because he literally got

2071
02:10:22,130 --> 02:10:27,030
ordered 10 that he couldn't go because
his arm was becoming infected and he,

2072
02:10:27,031 --> 02:10:29,630
he was, he could not,
they would not let him go.

2073
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:35,090
And so he's there an undisguised tears
down his face as he saw the column make

2074
02:10:35,091 --> 02:10:35,924
its way in.

2075
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:40,880
Joker sobber formed us up at first light
while the core stairs were blazing at

2076
02:10:40,881 --> 02:10:44,390
enemy hills. He told us that
we were going to aid Charlie,

2077
02:10:44,630 --> 02:10:46,310
going to the aid of Charlie company,

2078
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:51,730
which had been posted on Turkey hill
to guard the MSR last night after we

2079
02:10:51,801 --> 02:10:55,520
marched away from that area that
Chinese had poured out of the hills and

2080
02:10:55,521 --> 02:10:56,900
surrounded Charlie.

2081
02:10:57,410 --> 02:11:01,910
Charlie was fighting for its life when
we went to pull them out. So there's a,

2082
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:06,080
there's a small company of Marines,
Charlie Company,

2083
02:11:06,530 --> 02:11:08,570
and they are surrounded.

2084
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:17,520
They go up and one of the, one of the
abl companies, so you've got able,

2085
02:11:17,521 --> 02:11:22,521
Baker and Charlie able company sets up
on the flank and then Baker also patrols

2086
02:11:23,971 --> 02:11:27,480
up and kind of sets up to to come
to their aid. Back to the book,

2087
02:11:27,510 --> 02:11:28,440
through my binoculars,

2088
02:11:28,441 --> 02:11:31,950
I had a good view of Charlie's
perimeter for 100 yards away.

2089
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:33,660
They were in a tight circle,

2090
02:11:33,661 --> 02:11:38,430
not more than 75 yards across
halfway up the slope of Turkey hill,

2091
02:11:38,940 --> 02:11:43,080
Chinese machine guns and rifles infested
the halo around them firing at any

2092
02:11:43,081 --> 02:11:46,860
marine who moved Charlie's people
were thoroughly pinned down.

2093
02:11:46,861 --> 02:11:50,940
So picture this a little circle,
see all your, your whole company.

2094
02:11:50,941 --> 02:11:53,400
Maybe there's a hundred maybe there
could be 150 but I think they've taken a

2095
02:11:53,401 --> 02:11:54,510
bunch of wounded,
but at this point,

2096
02:11:54,690 --> 02:11:58,950
but they've got a hundred guys in a little
75 meter circle and you're all pinned

2097
02:11:58,951 --> 02:12:02,190
down and no matter what, every time you
move, every time his head gets stuck up,

2098
02:12:02,191 --> 02:12:05,840
you're getting shot at.
Back to the book lead,

2099
02:12:05,841 --> 02:12:09,240
put his machine guns on the Chinese who
were firing into Charlie's perimeter

2100
02:12:09,241 --> 02:12:10,260
from lower slope.

2101
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:14,520
My three mortars had the same target
ables machine guns and mortars raped the

2102
02:12:14,521 --> 02:12:15,630
hill above the perimeter.

2103
02:12:16,070 --> 02:12:20,730
Soon our tracers line the sky and puffs
of black smoke from the mortars dotted

2104
02:12:20,731 --> 02:12:21,570
the rocky hill.

2105
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:26,700
Then the big shells from artillery and
the battalion's 81 started to fall and

2106
02:12:26,701 --> 02:12:29,040
the hail rocked with their explosions.

2107
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:32,080
Chinese soldiers scurried for cover.

2108
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,350
My classmate pay attention to this.

2109
02:12:35,410 --> 02:12:40,410
My classmate gin Stemple led ables
assault down the ridge line and into the

2110
02:12:41,081 --> 02:12:41,914
Chinese.

2111
02:12:42,490 --> 02:12:47,350
The enemy soldiers had their heads down
from the heavy covering fire. Once again,

2112
02:12:47,351 --> 02:12:52,351
covering fire and Stempel's platoon
tore into them through the binoculars.

2113
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:56,020
I observed one squad of temple's Marines,

2114
02:12:56,200 --> 02:13:01,200
led by a giant of a man in a flapping
Parker who swung a huge double headed ax.

2115
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:09,360
The Chinese soldiers seeing this
great maniacal devil charge it.

2116
02:13:09,361 --> 02:13:12,120
Then branding brandishing a bloody ax,

2117
02:13:12,330 --> 02:13:14,730
abandoned their positions in terror.

2118
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:21,280
So there you have it. I've never, I never,

2119
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:25,180
I don't even know where you get a
battleax in the midst of the Korean War,

2120
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:30,300
but this marine right here attacks
the Chinese not with grenades,

2121
02:13:30,870 --> 02:13:35,800
not with a bar, not with a machine gun.
He attacks with a freaking battle ax.

2122
02:13:39,110 --> 02:13:39,943
Okay.

2123
02:13:40,650 --> 02:13:41,401
Back to the book.

2124
02:13:41,401 --> 02:13:44,730
That Chinese quickly lifted their seeds
of Charlie Company and made a rapid

2125
02:13:44,731 --> 02:13:49,170
retreat from Turkey hill. As they
fled able companies downhill assault,

2126
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:51,630
they had to cross Baker's line of fire.

2127
02:13:52,080 --> 02:13:57,080
Woody Taylor's platoon had come up to
extend our line in every weapon we had was

2128
02:13:57,091 --> 02:14:00,960
trained on the Chinese says they ran to
the protecting slopes on the other side

2129
02:14:00,961 --> 02:14:04,800
of the valley. Turkey shoot at
Turkey hill are people called it.

2130
02:14:05,010 --> 02:14:08,850
We were at rapid fire with the mortars
and machine gun and machine guns,

2131
02:14:08,851 --> 02:14:13,500
the bars and there, and the rifles.
Even call Vars, rocket launcher.

2132
02:14:14,370 --> 02:14:18,810
Few Chinese made it all the way across
the gauntlet of exploding flaming steel.

2133
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:23,520
They dropped and heaps even before the
Australian planes came down on them.

2134
02:14:23,790 --> 02:14:27,390
We hadn't worked with the Australians
before and they were out to prove that

2135
02:14:27,391 --> 02:14:30,180
there was gung Ho is our
own Marine Corps pilots.

2136
02:14:30,810 --> 02:14:35,340
They came roaring low along the valley
from behind us and when they passed above

2137
02:14:35,341 --> 02:14:39,240
Lee's glowing pink vest,
they dropped even closer to the ground.

2138
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:44,250
They're, they're low enough to cut off
the chinks. Pigtails, Kelly quipped,

2139
02:14:44,970 --> 02:14:46,470
the planes had their blood there,

2140
02:14:46,471 --> 02:14:49,620
guns blazing and the Chinese
went down and bunches.

2141
02:14:50,370 --> 02:14:54,600
The Australians made two passes at the
end of their second low level of salt.

2142
02:14:54,601 --> 02:14:57,300
There were no Chinese
soldiers left to shoot that.

2143
02:14:59,350 --> 02:15:03,190
It took almost every able bodied man
that Charlie company had to bring down

2144
02:15:03,191 --> 02:15:06,500
their dead and wounded there overnight.

2145
02:15:06,501 --> 02:15:09,710
Defense of Turkey hill had costs dearly

2146
02:15:13,710 --> 02:15:17,970
and they got one more rescue
mission basically to do.

2147
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:20,210
There was a uh,

2148
02:15:20,490 --> 02:15:24,750
Fox company is now in another situation,

2149
02:15:25,150 --> 02:15:25,650
you know,

2150
02:15:25,650 --> 02:15:30,650
horrible scenario and first Baker one
seven needs to get to them and it is a

2151
02:15:35,490 --> 02:15:39,840
treacherous, treacherous
movement. And they decide,

2152
02:15:40,620 --> 02:15:42,600
you remember early in the book you said,
you know,

2153
02:15:42,601 --> 02:15:46,470
we weren't used to night fighting. They'd
be mostly work during the day. Well,

2154
02:15:46,471 --> 02:15:51,210
they decide that they need to do this
at night so they go on this patrol at

2155
02:15:51,211 --> 02:15:55,980
night. Going back to the book
under the heavy Parker's,

2156
02:15:55,981 --> 02:16:00,060
our body sweated with the strain, but
our hands and feet were frozen, numb.

2157
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:03,600
The wind borne cold
attacked with terrible fury.

2158
02:16:04,410 --> 02:16:05,820
When we stopped for bearings,

2159
02:16:05,940 --> 02:16:10,500
we stood silent and motionless
because we needed to maintain Silas.

2160
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:14,880
We could not slap our hands against our
sides or stomp our feet for circulation.

2161
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:19,590
The cold gnawed at our toes and
fingers and ate into our bodies.

2162
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:23,730
The sweat we generated,
wall climbing froze against our skin.

2163
02:16:24,510 --> 02:16:28,740
We shivered violently. Men muttered
through their clenched teeth. Some of our,

2164
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:33,650
we're freezing to death here
and they push on.

2165
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:37,550
I returned to, decided to call them.
Many men had collapsed in the snow,

2166
02:16:37,551 --> 02:16:42,551
curled into balls like Eskimo dogs and
CEO's moved along the fallen prodding and

2167
02:16:44,151 --> 02:16:45,770
kicking,
urging them to their feet.

2168
02:16:45,980 --> 02:16:49,010
I collided with another marine
churning forward through the snow.

2169
02:16:49,130 --> 02:16:52,040
Both of us fell and as
we weirdly recovered,

2170
02:16:52,100 --> 02:16:56,610
I realized that I had knocked down
Colonel Davis. What's the holdup?

2171
02:16:56,630 --> 02:16:59,030
Lieutenant was all my
battalion commander said.

2172
02:16:59,031 --> 02:17:01,580
Then he continued breaking through
the snow to the head of the call.

2173
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:04,520
Time had no meaning.

2174
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:09,700
We labored through infinite darkness and
ghostly clouds of snow over an icy path

2175
02:17:10,791 --> 02:17:13,280
that rose and fell,
but seem to lead nowhere.

2176
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:17,280
We saw only the back of a man's head,

2177
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:22,880
a hunched figure in a long
shapeless Parker who's every
tortured step was an act

2178
02:17:25,020 --> 02:17:25,920
of will.

2179
02:17:28,520 --> 02:17:33,110
We carried on with the only
strength that was left to us.

2180
02:17:33,770 --> 02:17:36,170
Marine core discipline.

2181
02:17:41,970 --> 02:17:42,270
Yeah.

2182
02:17:42,270 --> 02:17:47,270
They finally get within range after this
brutal freezing march and here we go.

2183
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,760
The night exploded with the
flash and sound of the fight.

2184
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:57,450
The marines had the advantage
of surprise and momentum.

2185
02:17:57,630 --> 02:18:02,100
They fought with fierce energy. Now
released from hours of cold and misery.

2186
02:18:02,280 --> 02:18:05,220
The Chinese could do little
more than try to escape.

2187
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:09,920
Many of them were on armed
and most ran off to the south,

2188
02:18:09,950 --> 02:18:14,540
so the the the Chinese run,
there's some firing,

2189
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:15,500
there's some shooting,

2190
02:18:16,490 --> 02:18:20,420
but it's pretty much our route because
they had gone at night and they had

2191
02:18:20,421 --> 02:18:23,330
pushed harder. They had that
surprise and violence of action.

2192
02:18:25,360 --> 02:18:26,260
Back to the book.

2193
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:30,730
Dawn arrived gray and cold and we
jumped off the second phase of the

2194
02:18:30,731 --> 02:18:33,790
breakthrough.
Able and Baker attacked online,

2195
02:18:33,791 --> 02:18:36,580
headed out for Fox hill
a thousand yards away.

2196
02:18:37,750 --> 02:18:39,160
Minutes after we moved out.

2197
02:18:39,250 --> 02:18:44,140
Kaiser's platoon on the left walked into
heavy small arms machine gun fire from

2198
02:18:44,141 --> 02:18:45,400
a ridge on his flank.

2199
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:50,080
The sixties responded with h e on the
ridge and Kaiser's people broke through

2200
02:18:50,081 --> 02:18:53,950
the deep snow to melt the hill.
When they neared the ridge line,

2201
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:57,490
we lifted mortar fire and the platoon
drove through the enemy position on its

2202
02:18:57,491 --> 02:18:59,950
own firepower cover and move added again.

2203
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:02,950
We were astonished by our
first view of Fox Hill.

2204
02:19:03,580 --> 02:19:07,630
The snow field that led up
to the embattled company's
position was covered with

2205
02:19:07,660 --> 02:19:10,600
hundreds of dead Chinese soldiers.

2206
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:14,860
Many of them seem to sleep
under blankets of drifted snow,

2207
02:19:15,010 --> 02:19:18,340
but their bodies were
frozen in spasms of pain.

2208
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:23,380
There would jumbles of corpses
in padded green uniforms.

2209
02:19:23,840 --> 02:19:28,160
A white clad column had fallen in the
formation that it attracted the attention

2210
02:19:28,161 --> 02:19:30,500
of Fox company's machine gunners.

2211
02:19:31,300 --> 02:19:36,300
Craters of dirt and snow made by the big
guns were rimmed with bodies and parts

2212
02:19:36,951 --> 02:19:37,784
of men,

2213
02:19:38,810 --> 02:19:43,430
thick bands of dead Chinese lay at
the base of Fox company's perimeter.

2214
02:19:44,480 --> 02:19:49,190
We stood in wonder men
bowed their heads in prayer.

2215
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:54,220
Some fell to their knees or their
brief quiet ost oats of disbelief.

2216
02:19:56,090 --> 02:20:01,090
Tears came to the eyes of raggedy marines
who had endured bitter cold and savage

2217
02:20:01,940 --> 02:20:06,470
battle to reach this place
of suffering and courage.

2218
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:13,810
Someone let loose a wild cheer and we
broke forward in a jubilant run across the

2219
02:20:14,361 --> 02:20:16,880
snow covered at corpse field battlefield.

2220
02:20:17,120 --> 02:20:21,290
The Marines of Fox company waved
brightly colored banners. The blue,

2221
02:20:21,291 --> 02:20:23,780
yellow and red remnants
of the parachute drops it.

2222
02:20:23,781 --> 02:20:28,340
It sustained them for nearly a week
around their perimeter.

2223
02:20:28,460 --> 02:20:33,460
Fox company had constructed barricades
of frozen Chinese bodies from behind

2224
02:20:34,551 --> 02:20:39,551
these walls of of the d from
behind these walls of dead.

2225
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:44,240
The marines had mounted their weapons
and maintain a fight against an enemy

2226
02:20:44,270 --> 02:20:47,540
who's number's never ceased.
Now,

2227
02:20:47,541 --> 02:20:52,310
the men of Fox company arose from behind
these groups and piles to join us arms,

2228
02:20:52,311 --> 02:20:56,600
slings and blood.
SOCOM presses were common among them.

2229
02:20:57,230 --> 02:21:01,220
Med hobbled about with makeshift
leg splints. All hands,

2230
02:21:01,221 --> 02:21:04,040
we're haggard at dirty as we're we.

2231
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:10,240
We exchanged profane greetings that did
not conceal the love that we marines

2232
02:21:10,311 --> 02:21:11,360
felt for each other.

2233
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:17,330
The Sun came out and marines appeared
along the skyline's to the north.

2234
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:21,950
Then we saw marines marching
down the MSR towards us.

2235
02:21:22,280 --> 02:21:26,930
There were columns of riflemen at first
followed by a long trail of vehicle and

2236
02:21:26,931 --> 02:21:31,370
the vehicles and artillery pieces
are Corsair, swooped in close.

2237
02:21:31,371 --> 02:21:33,470
They're crooked,
wings wagging and salute.

2238
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:38,300
The fifth and Seventh Marines
had broken out of you. Dumb knee.

2239
02:21:41,500 --> 02:21:45,790
Now they broke out.
They have a path,

2240
02:21:45,791 --> 02:21:50,020
but they still have to go 14
miles to get out of there.

2241
02:21:51,660 --> 02:21:54,630
Back to the book.
All the platoon sergeants had been hit,

2242
02:21:55,170 --> 02:21:56,880
as were most of the squad leaders.

2243
02:21:56,881 --> 02:21:59,880
We had corporals and privates
stepping into leadership billets,

2244
02:22:00,090 --> 02:22:03,660
but they were combat experienced
marines and they knew the work.

2245
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:07,530
The Marine column that came
out of the besieged, do you?

2246
02:22:07,531 --> 02:22:09,900
Dom knee had hundreds of jeeps,

2247
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:13,950
ambulances and trucks as well as the
big guns of the artillery regiment.

2248
02:22:14,350 --> 02:22:18,330
Many of the trucks were filled with
wounded men and some were stacked with the

2249
02:22:18,331 --> 02:22:22,560
corpses of our own killed in action,
the walking wounded.

2250
02:22:22,561 --> 02:22:26,160
So now you've got to picture this column
like almost like a mad looking column.

2251
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:30,990
The walking wounded who could carry a
weapon work turned to as riflemen to

2252
02:22:30,991 --> 02:22:34,200
protect the column.
Every man who could walk,

2253
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:36,930
hobble or limp was ordered off the trucks.

2254
02:22:37,020 --> 02:22:40,440
The only riders were those serious cases,

2255
02:22:40,710 --> 02:22:45,710
the gut wounds and blinded men along
with severe leg wounds and men with

2256
02:22:45,901 --> 02:22:48,660
frostbite so bad that they
would need amputation.

2257
02:22:49,610 --> 02:22:49,870
Okay?

2258
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:52,090
Many of the wounded died in the trucks,

2259
02:22:52,150 --> 02:22:55,990
some froze to death and some
were shot by the infiltrators.

2260
02:22:57,130 --> 02:23:02,130
The 14 mile ride was three days
and nights of grim survival.

2261
02:23:06,650 --> 02:23:11,210
The rifle companies of the
fifth and seventh marine
stayed in the hills guarding

2262
02:23:11,211 --> 02:23:16,000
the MSR is the column pulled in to Haggar.
Rury.

2263
02:23:17,390 --> 02:23:22,390
The garrison town came out to meet the
bedraggled Marines who had run the 14

2264
02:23:22,671 --> 02:23:25,190
mile gauntlet of fire and ice.

2265
02:23:26,810 --> 02:23:29,930
As the walking wounded came
with inside of the town,

2266
02:23:30,170 --> 02:23:33,260
someone commanded them to fall into ranks.

2267
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:38,690
Maybe it was the limping sergeant who
gave the command the old salt who had set

2268
02:23:38,691 --> 02:23:41,720
the defenses along Bob
Fisher's stretch of the column.

2269
02:23:42,170 --> 02:23:44,810
It could have been father Griffin.
We're sergeant wing it.

2270
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:47,780
We're corporate Burris
or Corporal Johnson,

2271
02:23:49,780 --> 02:23:52,810
the wounded men and some who are unharmed,

2272
02:23:52,811 --> 02:23:57,670
but who staggered from exhaustion
formed up into three files,

2273
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:01,450
shouldered their weapons
and marched and ragged step

2274
02:24:03,020 --> 02:24:08,020
slowly the tread of their thick rubber
soled Pat Schou packs on the icy road

2275
02:24:08,151 --> 02:24:13,151
became a steady sure cadence and the
haggard and hurt marines put their heads

2276
02:24:13,611 --> 02:24:17,760
high.
Captain Wilcox,

2277
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:21,300
who couldn't carry a weapon
was in the Ford ranks.

2278
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:26,640
His arm was in a huge cast and splinted
so it was horizontal to the deck.

2279
02:24:26,790 --> 02:24:31,650
His head and face were a cocoon of
bandages, but holding himself erect.

2280
02:24:31,651 --> 02:24:33,420
He picked up the cadence in March,

2281
02:24:33,421 --> 02:24:37,410
standing straight into Haga Rury,

2282
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:44,170
a battalion sergeant at battalion surgeon
took time away from the hundreds of

2283
02:24:44,171 --> 02:24:48,880
wounded men. He tended in the aid
station to witness the columns,

2284
02:24:48,920 --> 02:24:51,100
arrival,
those bastards,

2285
02:24:52,210 --> 02:24:57,210
those magnificent bastards were the words
the doctor used to describe the worn

2286
02:24:58,571 --> 02:25:01,540
and torn marines from you dumb knee.

2287
02:25:07,670 --> 02:25:11,600
And I want you to,
I want you to picture that image,

2288
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:12,913
okay?

2289
02:25:13,370 --> 02:25:18,350
That image of these hundreds
of men just battered, wounded,

2290
02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:24,220
barely even able to walk frostbitten and
they're meandering into camp and when

2291
02:25:24,971 --> 02:25:27,520
they get close, someone
says, Hey, fall in.

2292
02:25:28,930 --> 02:25:32,590
And they fall into ranks
and they begin to march

2293
02:25:37,670 --> 02:25:38,503
will.

2294
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:44,110
That's human will and it's human
will under the power of leadership.

2295
02:25:44,111 --> 02:25:48,640
And he doesn't even know who gave that
order. Somebody said, fall in the ranks.

2296
02:25:48,641 --> 02:25:52,010
It's the right thing to do.
And they do it.

2297
02:25:52,580 --> 02:25:54,860
They find more,
they find,

2298
02:25:55,190 --> 02:26:00,190
they dig deeper to fallen to ranks and
hold their heads high as they walk back

2299
02:26:02,271 --> 02:26:06,570
into town.
Back to the book,

2300
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:12,300
except for the road we had
opened Haga Rury was under siege,

2301
02:26:12,301 --> 02:26:14,820
surrounded by many thousands
of Chinese soldiers.

2302
02:26:14,821 --> 02:26:19,170
They had been held off by a battalion
of the first marines and a hundreds of

2303
02:26:19,171 --> 02:26:24,171
rear echelon people who had reverted
to rifleman for three days and nights.

2304
02:26:24,991 --> 02:26:29,250
The cooks and bakers truck
drivers and artillery men office,

2305
02:26:29,251 --> 02:26:33,570
pinkies and technicians dug
in alongside infantry marines.

2306
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:39,560
They threw back every thrust the Chinese
made against the Hagia Rury perimeter.

2307
02:26:40,770 --> 02:26:45,390
American soldiers were there to army
technical support people who picked up

2308
02:26:45,391 --> 02:26:50,010
rifles and bars and went up the
hills and filled in the marine lines.

2309
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:52,080
Wherever there were gaps.

2310
02:26:52,090 --> 02:26:57,090
The artillery through an massive
bombardments during daylight hours,

2311
02:26:57,181 --> 02:26:59,340
the coursers flew in low with bombs,

2312
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:02,700
rockets and napalm to help
hold the attackers at bay.

2313
02:27:04,240 --> 02:27:08,320
The three divisions of Chinese who
tried to isolate the fifth and seventh

2314
02:27:08,321 --> 02:27:09,154
marines,

2315
02:27:09,190 --> 02:27:14,190
plus those who had been at Fox hill
followed us south and now they added their

2316
02:27:15,791 --> 02:27:20,620
numbers to the Incircl Mint of Hagia Rury,
the single road,

2317
02:27:20,740 --> 02:27:25,740
the MSR to kowtow re and our only
way out was caught off the hills.

2318
02:27:28,421 --> 02:27:32,800
That flank that road were high and steep
and there were as many Chinese embedded

2319
02:27:32,801 --> 02:27:35,740
in them as their head
been at you dumb knee.

2320
02:27:35,741 --> 02:27:40,510
So there's still completely surrounded,
but all this stuff is happening.

2321
02:27:40,511 --> 02:27:41,680
There's still surrounded

2322
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:49,640
the engineers with their heavy earth
moving equipment had dynamited the frozen

2323
02:27:49,641 --> 02:27:53,660
ground and leveled and airfield large
enough for cargo planes to fly in and out

2324
02:27:53,661 --> 02:27:58,661
of Hagia Rury air force pilots flew
in the big clumsy planes loaded with

2325
02:28:00,141 --> 02:28:01,100
replacements,

2326
02:28:01,160 --> 02:28:05,360
rations and ammunition
for the return trip.

2327
02:28:06,050 --> 02:28:08,780
They filled the plains with
the most seriously wounded.

2328
02:28:09,530 --> 02:28:10,940
When they landed and took off,

2329
02:28:11,360 --> 02:28:14,480
they had to fly low between
the hills that line the valley,

2330
02:28:14,481 --> 02:28:19,400
the planes became slow moving targets
for the Chinese guns in the hills and

2331
02:28:19,401 --> 02:28:24,170
every one that left Haga Rury
was perforated with bullet holes.

2332
02:28:25,280 --> 02:28:30,280
The men on the ground marveled at the
courage of the air force pilots who kept

2333
02:28:30,291 --> 02:28:31,580
flying in and out of there.

2334
02:28:31,610 --> 02:28:36,610
So you've got just cargo pilots
flying in to this place in sanity

2335
02:28:40,660 --> 02:28:41,850
now?
Yeah,

2336
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:49,630
they're in a position on a perimeter
because just because they survived all

2337
02:28:49,991 --> 02:28:51,700
that, they still gotta to go
back out and hold perimeter.

2338
02:28:52,390 --> 02:28:54,280
They get out to hold
perimeter and here we go.

2339
02:28:54,281 --> 02:28:55,870
Back to the book through my glasses,

2340
02:28:56,290 --> 02:29:00,010
I saw column of 15 rifleman marching
toward us out of Hagia Rury.

2341
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:04,240
There were two files and then moving
at a brisk pace alongside the road,

2342
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:07,150
but alongside both sides of the road.
They weren't crisp,

2343
02:29:07,180 --> 02:29:12,180
White Parker's and swung their arms
smartly because they were clean shaven and

2344
02:29:12,281 --> 02:29:15,850
an energetic, we assumed they were fresh
replacements flown in from the airstrip.

2345
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:20,620
We found out later that these clean
and jumped he troops were royal British

2346
02:29:20,620 --> 02:29:25,330
Marines who had fought their way
into Haga Rury from the south.

2347
02:29:25,510 --> 02:29:29,380
They too had found the MSR blocked and
they had punched through the Chinese

2348
02:29:29,381 --> 02:29:31,660
forces,
far superior to them a number.

2349
02:29:33,910 --> 02:29:35,880
They were the 41st commando,

2350
02:29:35,890 --> 02:29:40,360
a unit that roughly compared in size to
one of our own rifle companies like us.

2351
02:29:40,450 --> 02:29:42,880
These marines had
suffered heavy casualties.

2352
02:29:43,780 --> 02:29:48,640
The Royal Marine column halted in spread
into ditches along the road near our CP.

2353
02:29:49,650 --> 02:29:54,650
A freshly groomed young officer's strode
toward Kelly topple and me with the

2354
02:29:55,121 --> 02:29:59,050
young officer was a grizzled sergeant
whose proper military bearing could have

2355
02:29:59,051 --> 02:30:01,180
come straight from the pages of Kipling.

2356
02:30:02,380 --> 02:30:06,640
The sergeant had a meticulously trimmed
broad mustache that would've stirred

2357
02:30:06,641 --> 02:30:08,350
gunny Buckley's envy,

2358
02:30:09,550 --> 02:30:13,930
like the lieutenant or the sergeant
was dazzling, clean, and squared away,

2359
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,600
right binoculars hung around my neck,

2360
02:30:16,601 --> 02:30:19,090
which is how the lieutenant
distinguished me as an officer.

2361
02:30:19,780 --> 02:30:24,780
Certainly there was little
other difference among
Kelly and topple and me are

2362
02:30:25,061 --> 02:30:29,110
Parker's were all stained with blood food,
gun oil,

2363
02:30:29,170 --> 02:30:31,090
dirt are filthy.

2364
02:30:31,091 --> 02:30:36,091
Faces were matted with bristly beards
that bore icicles of mucus and spittle.

2365
02:30:38,300 --> 02:30:40,910
The lieutenant concealed his
disdain for our appearance,

2366
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:45,140
braced himself and delivered a
broad hand salute. I say, sir,

2367
02:30:45,650 --> 02:30:50,430
we've ordered to extend our
patrol beyond your lines, um,

2368
02:30:50,431 --> 02:30:53,670
to get up the covering machine guns
and I would be most grateful for your

2369
02:30:53,671 --> 02:30:57,670
suggestions.
I appreciated the British lieutenants,

2370
02:30:57,671 --> 02:31:00,760
Kurtz courtesy,
and if I possessed a ranger,

2371
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:05,440
I would have shaved on the spot to
make myself more presentable. Says,

2372
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:08,800
one of the reasons I included this,
because people always ask me, you know,

2373
02:31:08,801 --> 02:31:10,750
you ever work with any other militaries?

2374
02:31:10,870 --> 02:31:15,010
And I've worked with the British and
people say, you know, how are they? Well,

2375
02:31:15,011 --> 02:31:18,310
this is how the British are.
The British are outstanding,

2376
02:31:18,520 --> 02:31:22,710
the are so professional.
It's, it's, it's great.

2377
02:31:22,890 --> 02:31:26,970
It's so impressive. They're
like impeccable. Just the
way they're described her.

2378
02:31:26,971 --> 02:31:29,010
That's the way the British art,
that's the way the British military,

2379
02:31:29,011 --> 02:31:32,790
as their outstanding
back to the book,

2380
02:31:32,791 --> 02:31:35,730
the Royal Marine Lieutenant and his
sergeant followed me to our machine gun

2381
02:31:35,731 --> 02:31:38,910
positions and they checked out the
fields of fire for their own mission.

2382
02:31:39,450 --> 02:31:40,650
As we walked the line together,

2383
02:31:40,651 --> 02:31:43,860
we exchanged observations
about fighting the Chinese.

2384
02:31:45,060 --> 02:31:47,390
The British lieutenant knew
what he was talking about.

2385
02:31:48,490 --> 02:31:49,323
Okay.

2386
02:31:50,310 --> 02:31:52,110
Cock a little bit about the army units.

2387
02:31:52,111 --> 02:31:56,550
The army outfits that went east to the
reservoir were her be patched together

2388
02:31:56,551 --> 02:31:58,350
and poorly equipped for their mission.

2389
02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:02,690
The artillery and tanks that
were to support their advantage.

2390
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:06,810
We're not organized in time to accompany
them when they move north of how out of

2391
02:32:06,811 --> 02:32:11,811
Hagia rowry the heavy weapons that
aided the marine breakout west of the

2392
02:32:12,151 --> 02:32:12,984
reservoir.

2393
02:32:12,990 --> 02:32:17,880
We're not there for the army and many of
the soldiers in that fight had not yet

2394
02:32:17,881 --> 02:32:21,930
received cold weather gear
scores of them froze to death.

2395
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:26,420
It was the army's bad fortune to that.

2396
02:32:26,421 --> 02:32:30,290
A large number of its officers and
experienced NCO is had been knocked out of

2397
02:32:30,291 --> 02:32:34,920
the battle out at the onset,
the two senior commanders occur,

2398
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:39,890
a colonel and the lieutenant colonel
was killed at the front of their troops.

2399
02:32:40,340 --> 02:32:44,120
Most of the company commanders and
platoon leaders went down in a short time.

2400
02:32:44,121 --> 02:32:49,121
The casualties of all ranks outnumbered
the able bodied and some of the wounded

2401
02:32:49,310 --> 02:32:50,840
had to be left behind,

2402
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:56,680
but tunes and squads dwindled to a few
men and coalesced into small bands that

2403
02:32:57,231 --> 02:32:59,960
fought until their ammunition was gone.

2404
02:33:01,040 --> 02:33:05,120
Those who could walk or crawl then
made their way back across the frozen

2405
02:33:05,130 --> 02:33:10,130
reservoir to the marine lines
at [inaudible] for the soldiers.

2406
02:33:10,850 --> 02:33:14,090
It was a disastrous fight,
but it had one good effect.

2407
02:33:14,840 --> 02:33:19,190
The Chinese division that mold them
was aimed at the attack on Haga Rury.

2408
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:23,780
The fight the soldiers put up on the east
side of the reservoir had slowed their

2409
02:33:23,781 --> 02:33:28,781
advance and that bought valuable time
for the marines and the army survivors

2410
02:33:30,261 --> 02:33:32,540
made their way into hogger Rury.

2411
02:33:32,750 --> 02:33:37,670
Those who could still carry on were
reequipped and formed into a provisional

2412
02:33:37,671 --> 02:33:40,910
battalion. That became part
of the First Marine Division,

2413
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:44,840
a fall along side us for the
remainder of the campaign.

2414
02:33:51,390 --> 02:33:52,223
Now,

2415
02:33:52,460 --> 02:33:53,820
well, like I said, at this point,

2416
02:33:53,821 --> 02:33:58,821
there's still surrounded and they need
to now break out to get south to a town

2417
02:33:59,851 --> 02:34:04,500
called Hung Naum where there's a port
where they're going to be extracted during

2418
02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:06,990
be pulled out.
Back to the book,

2419
02:34:06,991 --> 02:34:11,991
one seven Arba and two seven where to
lead the breakout from Cotto re one seven

2420
02:34:13,351 --> 02:34:18,351
was to take the high ground east of the
road to seven the west four miles on the

2421
02:34:19,451 --> 02:34:22,690
MSR. The Chinese had blown out
a bridge over a deep chasms.

2422
02:34:23,530 --> 02:34:28,530
The battalion first marines coming from
the south would take the ground that

2423
02:34:28,811 --> 02:34:30,970
commanded the other side of that gap.

2424
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:36,430
Then the engineer's were putting in a
new bridge beyond that was a full army

2425
02:34:36,431 --> 02:34:39,610
division.
The third waiting to give us cover.

2426
02:34:41,560 --> 02:34:44,860
After we crossed the bridge,
the army would take over the fighting.

2427
02:34:45,700 --> 02:34:49,360
All we needed to do was
get a few more divisions,

2428
02:34:49,660 --> 02:34:52,210
get through a few more
divisions of Chinese soldiers.

2429
02:34:52,360 --> 02:34:55,840
So even on the division level,
10,000 we're talking,

2430
02:34:55,850 --> 02:34:59,200
covering move even on the division level.
So it's an individual thing.

2431
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:01,060
It's a squad thing.
It's a platoon thing.

2432
02:35:01,061 --> 02:35:03,620
It goes all the way up to the division
level because they need to have the cover

2433
02:35:03,621 --> 02:35:07,780
of the army to get out of there.
Here we go.

2434
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:13,060
April company went out in front.
The Chinese, the weighting,

2435
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:17,320
Chinese immediately put down a sheet
of fire, mortars, machine guns,

2436
02:35:17,350 --> 02:35:21,910
burp guns, rifles. April's
casualty. Soon started to return.

2437
02:35:22,480 --> 02:35:26,710
We huddled against the blowing
clouds of snow and prayed to God.

2438
02:35:26,711 --> 02:35:31,270
That able wouldn't get so badly malt
that we would have to take their place.

2439
02:35:33,380 --> 02:35:35,240
Our prayers were not answered.

2440
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:40,250
Battalion ordered us to pass through
Abel and continue the attack.

2441
02:35:40,880 --> 02:35:44,090
Although it was daylight,
we could barely see where we were going.

2442
02:35:45,110 --> 02:35:47,210
The Chinese did not need to see us.

2443
02:35:47,330 --> 02:35:51,770
There was only one way for us to get
it damaged straight along the road.

2444
02:35:53,290 --> 02:35:57,070
They had our approach well marked
and covered with their weapons.

2445
02:35:57,160 --> 02:35:58,690
As soon as we went past able,

2446
02:35:58,691 --> 02:36:02,530
the Chinese mortars began to drop
and their machine guns opened.

2447
02:36:03,580 --> 02:36:07,540
The tracers where weird streaks of orange
that flew out of the blinding snow.

2448
02:36:07,541 --> 02:36:12,490
Clouds are new.
Korman was quickly put to work.

2449
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:18,760
The Chinese were shooting down from a
hill that flanked woody as well as from

2450
02:36:19,401 --> 02:36:20,234
straight ahead.

2451
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:23,570
Joe didn't want to send anyone up that
hill fearing he would lose them in the

2452
02:36:23,571 --> 02:36:26,140
heavy snow. I keep, you're
just getting shot at the,

2453
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:30,020
there's clouds up there at altitude and
so you're just getting shot from snow.

2454
02:36:30,290 --> 02:36:34,160
It's like a cloud. That shooting machine
gun fire at you. It's a nightmare.

2455
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:36,081
Back to the book.

2456
02:36:36,081 --> 02:36:39,740
We were getting nowhere joke or Saba
was standing alongside the road behind

2457
02:36:39,741 --> 02:36:42,530
Lee's platoon.
He called me over to him.

2458
02:36:42,860 --> 02:36:45,560
Bullet zinged in shrapnel wind around us,

2459
02:36:45,561 --> 02:36:47,870
but Joe stood straight
and I stood with him.

2460
02:36:49,010 --> 02:36:51,830
He decided to risk and move
up the hill on the left flank.

2461
02:36:52,160 --> 02:36:55,280
Move Your platoon up there, Joe.
Oh, by the way, at this point,

2462
02:36:55,281 --> 02:36:58,430
Joe had taken over a platoon. He was no
longer just in charge of mortars. Now,

2463
02:36:58,431 --> 02:37:00,200
one of the sergeants was
in charge of the mortars,

2464
02:37:00,320 --> 02:37:04,940
so he's now in charge of a rifle
platoon. Move Your platoon up there, Joe.

2465
02:37:04,941 --> 02:37:08,270
He instructed me, see if you can
take those guns out there killing us.

2466
02:37:08,930 --> 02:37:12,590
He spread out his mat and trace the route,
spread out his map.

2467
02:37:12,591 --> 02:37:16,490
They trace the route that I was to follow.
He fell silent.

2468
02:37:18,670 --> 02:37:23,670
A Chinese bullet had found its target
just below the rim of his helmet in the

2469
02:37:23,741 --> 02:37:27,570
center of his forehead.
A small black hole appeared there.

2470
02:37:27,690 --> 02:37:29,080
Joke or Saab is dead.

2471
02:37:29,081 --> 02:37:33,070
Eyes stared at me for several seconds
before he slumped slowly to the ground.

2472
02:37:35,490 --> 02:37:38,790
I caught him in my arms as he
fell and held him for a moment.

2473
02:37:39,900 --> 02:37:44,440
Then I lowered him gently into
this snow. Jesus. God joke,

2474
02:37:44,441 --> 02:37:49,110
her Saba, my friend Joe, who had
helped me so much show me so much,

2475
02:37:49,170 --> 02:37:53,640
who had gone to bat for me with Captain
Wilcox, who had been my big brother,

2476
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:58,510
joker Saba,
whom I loved

2477
02:38:00,970 --> 02:38:03,400
taking the mat from his mitten hands.

2478
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:07,420
I went forward to give it to Lee and
inform him that he was the new company

2479
02:38:07,421 --> 02:38:08,254
commander.

2480
02:38:08,930 --> 02:38:09,400
Okay.

2481
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:10,330
On the way over,

2482
02:38:10,420 --> 02:38:14,290
I got on my walkie talkie to tell
battalion that Casaba was Kiaa.

2483
02:38:15,640 --> 02:38:20,470
Their CP was close behind in the walkie
talkie, worked through the Merck.

2484
02:38:20,770 --> 02:38:22,510
I spotted Lee's vest.

2485
02:38:23,170 --> 02:38:27,280
He was walking the line behind his men
who were prone in the snow covering 50

2486
02:38:27,281 --> 02:38:28,960
yards upfront.

2487
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:34,300
Looper cine with the bar was with him.
I felt alone without Kelly.

2488
02:38:35,170 --> 02:38:39,700
The Chinese fire was passing overhead
high. The enemy couldn't see us either.

2489
02:38:40,150 --> 02:38:43,240
Casabas dead.
I told Lee caught one in the head.

2490
02:38:43,690 --> 02:38:48,040
Dam was all Lee said in response,
you're the new skipper.

2491
02:38:48,041 --> 02:38:50,710
I added giving him the map.

2492
02:38:51,460 --> 02:38:54,310
Joe told me to go up the
hill on Woody's flank.

2493
02:38:54,340 --> 02:38:56,560
See if I can get around
those guns and take them out.

2494
02:38:56,561 --> 02:38:59,980
You still want me to do that?
We must do something.

2495
02:38:59,981 --> 02:39:04,930
Lisa said they're killing us up from
up there. That's what Joe said. Yes.

2496
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:08,500
See what you can do. Is Your
radio working? Yeah, I just
talked to battalion on it.

2497
02:39:08,501 --> 02:39:11,860
Okay. Let me know the situation when you
make it and when you're ready to attack.

2498
02:39:11,861 --> 02:39:15,310
If we can get artillery. I don't want
you to want run into friendly fire.

2499
02:39:15,730 --> 02:39:16,690
I skipper.

2500
02:39:16,750 --> 02:39:21,750
I said First Lieutenant Lee gave
me an ironic little smile at that,

2501
02:39:24,490 --> 02:39:29,230
so they're going to go up this hill and
try and take out that machine gun and as

2502
02:39:29,231 --> 02:39:32,590
they're going up the hill,
he starts hearing something.

2503
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:36,040
Someone called from behind us,
sir. Lieutenant owned Owen.

2504
02:39:36,670 --> 02:39:38,080
It was woody Taylor's runner.

2505
02:39:38,260 --> 02:39:41,560
He was breathing hard from the effort
he had made to catch up with us. Sir,

2506
02:39:41,620 --> 02:39:43,690
Lieutenant Taylor wants you
back down with the company.

2507
02:39:44,020 --> 02:39:48,490
Lieutenant Lee's been hit and Lieutenant
Taylor wants you on the double. He says,

2508
02:39:48,930 --> 02:39:49,870
damn it to hell.

2509
02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:53,320
I might've been able to roll the Chinese
from the flank and take out the guns

2510
02:39:53,321 --> 02:39:57,220
that were holding back the company.
I tried to get woody on my walkie talkie.

2511
02:39:57,790 --> 02:39:59,020
I got more static.

2512
02:40:00,580 --> 02:40:05,580
I waived for Morrison to rejoin us and
the tiny platoons slipped and slid back

2513
02:40:06,401 --> 02:40:09,700
down the hill as they came behind me.
The men,

2514
02:40:09,701 --> 02:40:12,910
Kirsten complain about the second
lieutenants making up their mind.

2515
02:40:13,620 --> 02:40:16,680
What he tailored,
waited for us at the base of the slope.

2516
02:40:16,770 --> 02:40:20,730
He was senior to me in rank and with lead
down. He was our new company commander.

2517
02:40:21,450 --> 02:40:25,920
He said that battalion had sent up a
pair of tanks and their firepower would

2518
02:40:25,921 --> 02:40:29,640
cover a frontal assault up the hill.
So here we go.

2519
02:40:29,910 --> 02:40:34,740
Finally we get tanks in. Anyone that
doesn't know I am a huge fan of tanks.

2520
02:40:35,070 --> 02:40:38,100
I love tanks and all
you tankers out there,

2521
02:40:38,130 --> 02:40:43,130
thank you for being out there
for these ground pounders.

2522
02:40:44,370 --> 02:40:47,400
So he couldn't, the old school tanks, they
had a little phone on the back of the,

2523
02:40:47,460 --> 02:40:50,340
on the back of the tank to talk to
the guys that were inside the tank.

2524
02:40:50,400 --> 02:40:54,090
He picks up that tank as they get
prepared to do this assault and he says,

2525
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:56,350
put your thirties up below the ridge.
Goop,

2526
02:40:56,351 --> 02:41:00,120
wishing going to 10 o'clock then on
my command, hit them with the cannons.

2527
02:41:00,330 --> 02:41:04,440
We'll jump off on that.
A tinny voice came from within the tank.

2528
02:41:04,470 --> 02:41:05,850
Hear you loud and clear.

2529
02:41:06,330 --> 02:41:10,530
The 30 caliber twin machine
guns of both tanks began there.

2530
02:41:10,531 --> 02:41:11,850
Jack Hammer pounding.

2531
02:41:12,270 --> 02:41:17,270
I watched red tracers stabbing up the
snow covered hill toward the Doug and

2532
02:41:17,371 --> 02:41:20,220
Chinese gun that we could now see dimly

2533
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:26,990
now the under that fire power, they start
to attack our line. Moved up the hill,

2534
02:41:27,050 --> 02:41:32,050
25 yards above me to Chinese soldiers
appeared from behind a large boulder one

2535
02:41:33,081 --> 02:41:37,310
had a rifle, the other burp gun. As
I swung my car being toward them,

2536
02:41:37,820 --> 02:41:39,620
I heard a grunt from Lupa cine.

2537
02:41:40,100 --> 02:41:44,000
He fired his bar straight into the
air and he fell forward in the snow.

2538
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:49,340
He did not move and I knew he was dead.
The best bar man we had,

2539
02:41:49,370 --> 02:41:51,500
God dammit,
you've lost Lupa cine.

2540
02:41:52,430 --> 02:41:55,550
I couldn't get my weapon on the
two Chinese above me fast enough.

2541
02:41:56,210 --> 02:42:01,010
The one with the rifle put around in my
left shoulder that spun me around its

2542
02:42:01,011 --> 02:42:02,540
impact,
generated a shock,

2543
02:42:02,541 --> 02:42:07,070
like a powerful jolt of electricity
that went through my entire body.

2544
02:42:07,130 --> 02:42:10,850
Damn. How can I be hit after all
of this? How could I get hit?

2545
02:42:11,930 --> 02:42:14,210
I saw the burp gun trigger a burst at me.

2546
02:42:14,810 --> 02:42:19,140
The snout of his weapon flashed and I
could not lift my feet above my need of

2547
02:42:19,160 --> 02:42:22,460
above the knee deep snow to get
out of the path of his bullets.

2548
02:42:23,150 --> 02:42:28,150
Two slugs tore into my right arm to more
of the electric jolts and my car being

2549
02:42:28,701 --> 02:42:33,020
flung itself away from my grasp.
I saw it rise into the air.

2550
02:42:33,110 --> 02:42:36,740
As I fell into the snow,
this cannot be happening.

2551
02:42:37,850 --> 02:42:42,800
I tried to raise my head and reach to
retrieve my car being get the bastards.

2552
02:42:43,640 --> 02:42:47,750
My arms wouldn't move.
I could not raise myself.

2553
02:42:48,110 --> 02:42:53,090
Joe's down. Someone shouted, Bill
Flux Voice, get the bastards.

2554
02:42:53,180 --> 02:42:55,310
I heard myself yelling,
get the bastards.

2555
02:42:55,670 --> 02:43:00,670
I screamed in pain and overwhelming anger
and my marines rushed past me and up

2556
02:43:01,641 --> 02:43:05,720
the hill leaving Lupa cine and me
and the snow. Get the bastards.

2557
02:43:05,721 --> 02:43:10,160
I yelled again and again.
It was all I could think to do.

2558
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:18,400
The young corpsman who had been assigned
to us for the day's battle cry for the

2559
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:23,260
day's battle. Heard my screams. Although
the enemy fire steel flayed the hill,

2560
02:43:23,261 --> 02:43:25,870
he ran clubs lead through
the snow to reach my side.

2561
02:43:26,020 --> 02:43:29,320
I was flat on my back and he
crouched beside me. Okay, Lieutenant,

2562
02:43:29,620 --> 02:43:34,620
he gasped for air with the exertion of
the run laden with his aid kit and cold

2563
02:43:34,841 --> 02:43:39,820
weather gear. His breath made puffs
of white steam and is smooth shaven.

2564
02:43:39,821 --> 02:43:44,821
Face was red with 25 below
zero cold with bullets.

2565
02:43:45,221 --> 02:43:47,920
Zinging all around of the new corner.
Cutaway my Parker,

2566
02:43:48,760 --> 02:43:49,780
the bullet through the shoulder,

2567
02:43:49,781 --> 02:43:54,610
it nicked my lung and blood was gushed
and blood gushed from my mouth and down

2568
02:43:54,611 --> 02:43:59,020
the front of my parka covering his
bare hands. Give me some morphine.

2569
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:03,910
I told the kid the pain was
terrible. I can't sir, I'm sorry.

2570
02:44:05,170 --> 02:44:10,170
He shook with the cold and with his own
fear bullets stung the air and raise

2571
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:16,330
little fountains of snow a few feet away.
Gimme some goddamn morphine. I yelled,

2572
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:20,350
spraying my blood on him,
sir. The morphine is frozen.

2573
02:44:20,590 --> 02:44:23,770
I can't give it to you.
What the Hell is wrong with you?

2574
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:27,820
Carry the goddamn stuff in your
mouth, don't you boots snow. Yes sir.

2575
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:29,050
I'm sorry sir.

2576
02:44:29,320 --> 02:44:32,860
He put the surette in his mouth and
continued to cut away at my clothing.

2577
02:44:33,550 --> 02:44:38,140
Just just try and be still, sir.
Even with the pain and the rage,

2578
02:44:38,141 --> 02:44:42,820
I realized that no one had told the new
doc how to take care of casualties in

2579
02:44:42,821 --> 02:44:47,560
below zero weather.
I gritted my teeth and tried to shut up.

2580
02:44:49,330 --> 02:44:53,320
I didn't feel the jab when he shoved
the syringe surette into my flesh,

2581
02:44:53,500 --> 02:44:56,230
but I soon felt a wave
of warmth come over me.

2582
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:01,330
The pain float away and the noise
of the fighting above us receded.

2583
02:45:02,570 --> 02:45:06,970
You're a good lad. I told the corpsman
I felt his hands doing something.

2584
02:45:07,180 --> 02:45:10,000
You'll be a good marine.
Yes sir.

2585
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:14,410
He sounded far away before I drifted off.

2586
02:45:14,650 --> 02:45:16,480
I remembered the photos in my helmet.

2587
02:45:16,900 --> 02:45:20,680
Those are the photos of his wife and
his two kids. My pictures. I said,

2588
02:45:21,100 --> 02:45:26,080
that's my wife and kids. Don't
let the geeks get them. I won't,

2589
02:45:26,081 --> 02:45:26,914
sir,

2590
02:45:27,040 --> 02:45:31,690
said the corpsman who had risked his
life to save mine and who's name I never

2591
02:45:31,691 --> 02:45:32,524
knew.

2592
02:45:36,360 --> 02:45:39,840
Woody Taylor was the only law
officer left with the company.

2593
02:45:40,830 --> 02:45:45,420
He let the troops, the crest of the
hill fighting as a rifle man himself.

2594
02:45:47,050 --> 02:45:52,050
The Chinese were on the run and battalion
ordered Bacon one seven to keep after

2595
02:45:52,181 --> 02:45:55,960
them.
The troops were frozen and exhausted,

2596
02:45:56,140 --> 02:45:57,490
but wardee pushed them on.

2597
02:45:58,530 --> 02:45:59,290
Okay.

2598
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:03,980
Late in the day they reached their
objective with their small number.

2599
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:08,570
They set a tight perimeter on the high
ground overlooking the gap in the road

2600
02:46:08,870 --> 02:46:11,300
that engineers would bridge the next day.

2601
02:46:14,690 --> 02:46:17,150
So they get that targets cure.

2602
02:46:17,151 --> 02:46:21,380
They get that hilltop and now they're
overlooking the gap where the engineers

2603
02:46:21,381 --> 02:46:26,381
are going to build that bridge and
they sat in to a security perimeter.

2604
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:33,320
Woody Taylor put the weary company on
50% watch against the enemy assault he

2605
02:46:33,321 --> 02:46:34,640
knew would come in the dark.

2606
02:46:36,080 --> 02:46:41,030
It was the coldest night that the men
had yet endured a reported 30 degrees

2607
02:46:41,031 --> 02:46:45,920
below zero. The wind howled
at them and every direction,

2608
02:46:46,250 --> 02:46:50,960
all through the unbearably cold hours
until dawn Taylor and Sergeant Richard

2609
02:46:50,961 --> 02:46:54,410
move from man to man to assure
that no one froze to death.

2610
02:46:56,170 --> 02:47:00,710
A detail of Korean soldiers who had been
attached to the army arrived to bolster

2611
02:47:00,711 --> 02:47:04,070
the perimeter. But most of them
filtered away during the night.

2612
02:47:05,950 --> 02:47:06,640
Yeah.

2613
02:47:06,640 --> 02:47:10,570
Several Times. Marines hurt the enemy
moving around their lines in the darkness,

2614
02:47:10,780 --> 02:47:15,780
but no attack came would he put out
patrols early in the morning before light.

2615
02:47:18,520 --> 02:47:19,090
Okay.

2616
02:47:19,090 --> 02:47:20,800
Within a hundred yards of a wine,

2617
02:47:20,801 --> 02:47:25,801
they found frozen dozens of frozen
Chinese soldiers whose feet and hands were

2618
02:47:27,911 --> 02:47:29,500
frozen to ice.

2619
02:47:31,420 --> 02:47:36,420
The extreme cold had been on our
side holding back the attack.

2620
02:47:39,030 --> 02:47:39,863
Yeah.

2621
02:47:40,180 --> 02:47:41,650
And the next day would he,

2622
02:47:41,651 --> 02:47:46,300
Taylor brought the remnants of
the company down from the hills,

2623
02:47:47,440 --> 02:47:52,440
marched them across the bridge and into
the shelter of the Chow town of Chin,

2624
02:47:54,521 --> 02:47:58,180
Hong knee,
their battle and did there

2625
02:48:00,450 --> 02:48:03,060
sergeant Richard took roll call,

2626
02:48:05,720 --> 02:48:06,730
his final count.

2627
02:48:10,190 --> 02:48:11,570
Where's 27 men?

2628
02:48:17,660 --> 02:48:18,493
Okay.

2629
02:48:21,300 --> 02:48:23,820
27 minutes.

2630
02:48:26,800 --> 02:48:27,700
And that is,

2631
02:48:27,730 --> 02:48:32,730
that's out of the original
200 plus men of the company.

2632
02:48:33,640 --> 02:48:35,050
And then on top of that,

2633
02:48:35,320 --> 02:48:40,320
another hundred replacements that
filled their ranks in this battle.

2634
02:48:41,440 --> 02:48:46,440
So that's 300 men and only 27 remained

2635
02:48:50,020 --> 02:48:50,853
27

2636
02:48:56,750 --> 02:48:57,583
now

2637
02:49:00,470 --> 02:49:05,470
few of us will ever
face those kind of odds

2638
02:49:10,820 --> 02:49:15,820
in few of us are ever going
to face those hellish demands.

2639
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:27,720
You of us will ever stare
at Hale like these men did.

2640
02:49:35,610 --> 02:49:39,470
But
I want you to think about something.

2641
02:49:39,471 --> 02:49:41,060
I want you to imagine.

2642
02:49:43,990 --> 02:49:48,990
Imagine what we can accomplish if we
applied even a fraction of the will that

2643
02:49:53,261 --> 02:49:56,260
these men displayed,
the iron will

2644
02:50:00,020 --> 02:50:05,020
oh will that is stronger than their
bodies a will that is stronger than their

2645
02:50:06,471 --> 02:50:07,520
minds

2646
02:50:10,820 --> 02:50:14,210
because clearly let's face it,
their bodies,

2647
02:50:15,570 --> 02:50:16,190
yeah,

2648
02:50:16,190 --> 02:50:17,690
their bodies were broken

2649
02:50:19,990 --> 02:50:23,530
and their minds in many cases or broken

2650
02:50:26,800 --> 02:50:30,250
and they didn't want to go on,
but there will,

2651
02:50:33,040 --> 02:50:35,320
there will prevailed.

2652
02:50:37,680 --> 02:50:38,513
Okay

2653
02:50:42,230 --> 02:50:43,063
will

2654
02:50:47,360 --> 02:50:49,880
we'll conquers all

2655
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:55,880
and our will is delivered
through discipline

2656
02:50:58,150 --> 02:51:01,840
and as Joe Owen stated
many times in the book,

2657
02:51:01,930 --> 02:51:06,880
sometimes the only thing that
press them on was disciplined

2658
02:51:12,450 --> 02:51:13,283
discipline,

2659
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:22,670
the discipline to push
yourself and you know, we

2660
02:51:24,740 --> 02:51:29,740
are all capable of more
I and capable of more.

2661
02:51:29,990 --> 02:51:32,060
You are capable of more,

2662
02:51:32,180 --> 02:51:37,180
you can overcome the obstacles
and the challenges and the enemy,

2663
02:51:38,030 --> 02:51:40,370
and you can overcome your own weaknesses.

2664
02:51:43,540 --> 02:51:47,590
Thank you.
Can overcome your own desire to quit.

2665
02:51:52,870 --> 02:51:54,400
Let let bees men

2666
02:51:57,210 --> 02:52:00,480
that these men be our examples

2667
02:52:03,730 --> 02:52:06,220
of how to fight

2668
02:52:08,840 --> 02:52:09,021
in,

2669
02:52:09,021 --> 02:52:14,021
how to use your will and how to drive on
and let these men B are examples of how

2670
02:52:16,850 --> 02:52:17,690
to live

2671
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:26,153
or don't.

2672
02:52:30,890 --> 02:52:33,950
Don't let these men down.

2673
02:52:41,300 --> 02:52:46,290
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight. Echo.

2674
02:52:48,630 --> 02:52:49,463
If you,
uh,

2675
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:55,350
want to give me a second here to recover
and talk about some stuff over there,

2676
02:52:55,650 --> 02:52:58,520
I'd be much obliged. Yeah, man,

2677
02:53:04,130 --> 02:53:07,170
this could be one of the
rougher of transitions. Yeah.

2678
02:53:08,890 --> 02:53:13,780
You know, it's, you gotta remind yourself,

2679
02:53:14,230 --> 02:53:19,150
this is a book. This
happened, this happened,

2680
02:53:19,210 --> 02:53:21,220
this happened,
this happened

2681
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:28,120
in the fact that these guys
could endure this and fight on.

2682
02:53:28,241 --> 02:53:33,241
If that doesn't give you the inspiration
that you need to step pass whatever

2683
02:53:35,001 --> 02:53:38,270
pathetic little challenges in
front of you, you're wrong.

2684
02:53:38,360 --> 02:53:41,570
Don't listen to this podcast anymore.
Go somewhere else.

2685
02:53:43,670 --> 02:53:45,710
Yeah.
Yeah.

2686
02:53:45,711 --> 02:53:50,711
It's easy to forget it because of
the kind of the contrast of your,

2687
02:53:53,080 --> 02:53:57,310
like your problem or whatever you want
to call it, your challenge, your task,

2688
02:53:57,410 --> 02:53:59,710
right issue that you're
trying to overcome.

2689
02:53:59,980 --> 02:54:04,980
And then contrast with basically the
luxury that you live in and that luxury is

2690
02:54:05,231 --> 02:54:10,231
kind of put on you this kind of
way of feeling on a habitual level.

2691
02:54:11,140 --> 02:54:11,973
So

2692
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:16,390
now you're faced with
this task comparatively.

2693
02:54:17,150 --> 02:54:21,500
Habitual comfort is what we experienced.
Yes. Habitual Comfort. Exactly right.

2694
02:54:21,501 --> 02:54:24,740
So then one night I woke up
early in the morning. Yeah.

2695
02:54:25,270 --> 02:54:26,103
Okay.

2696
02:54:26,370 --> 02:54:30,470
You know what I mean? Hey, I worked
out real hard and sweated a lot. Okay.

2697
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:34,700
Well really is that all I got? I need
to step it up man. I need to step it up.

2698
02:54:35,420 --> 02:54:38,960
Yeah. And you know, I woke up
early in the morning or you know,

2699
02:54:40,180 --> 02:54:44,250
I didn't get that much sleep.
So my real hardcore yeah,

2700
02:54:44,360 --> 02:54:48,830
your foot's not freezing off of your body.
Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. And,

2701
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:53,710
and what's, what's incredible, this is
every single time you go, damn, you know,

2702
02:54:53,900 --> 02:54:56,720
I'm glad they made it out of that didn't
make it out anything that they're still

2703
02:54:56,721 --> 02:55:00,590
just, just surrounded. Yeah. Yeah.

2704
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:06,470
Well, what's is when you do remind
yourself of this kind of stuff, like,

2705
02:55:06,860 --> 02:55:10,820
like right now, if you knew one
feels the way I do, I feel like, oh,

2706
02:55:10,850 --> 02:55:12,840
I feel pretty much rejuvenating.

2707
02:55:12,841 --> 02:55:16,550
And when I kind of flashed back to my
life for a second, yeah. I'm like, Oh man,

2708
02:55:16,880 --> 02:55:20,360
I'm kind of stoked. Yeah. I can
go, you know, if I got to work out,

2709
02:55:20,361 --> 02:55:23,780
I'm going to crush that workup
because I got all my limbs right now.

2710
02:55:23,781 --> 02:55:27,080
They didn't freeze off all this stuff.
So the point there is,

2711
02:55:27,410 --> 02:55:31,550
when you re are reminded
of real adversity,

2712
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:35,780
whether you remind yourself or the, or a
book or something you see or hear about,

2713
02:55:35,900 --> 02:55:40,460
um, like it, it gives you
that, like that added will to,

2714
02:55:41,090 --> 02:55:43,540
to overcome.
Maybe you,

2715
02:55:43,570 --> 02:55:48,170
you actually can take some
of their wheels. You can
learn it, you can learn it.

2716
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:52,100
You can say, Oh, you know what? Oh, I'm
cold right now. You're not cold, you're,

2717
02:55:52,101 --> 02:55:56,210
you're in. You are not cold. You
are not, you're tired right now. No,

2718
02:55:56,240 --> 02:56:00,380
you are not tired. You're afraid
right now. No. You are not afraid.

2719
02:56:01,100 --> 02:56:04,290
Learn. Yeah. Yeah. Learn,

2720
02:56:04,520 --> 02:56:08,990
increase your will through knowledge.
It's a real thing. Yup. It's true.

2721
02:56:09,110 --> 02:56:11,090
And when you do,
with my point being,

2722
02:56:11,091 --> 02:56:14,420
when you do remind yourself of
this kind of stuff and it helps,

2723
02:56:14,450 --> 02:56:19,380
it'll help you do whatever it is or,
or overcome the faculty.

2724
02:56:19,400 --> 02:56:22,250
Yeah.
Because you realize that you,

2725
02:56:22,251 --> 02:56:26,760
that human beings are capable of
more way more than once, you know,

2726
02:56:26,790 --> 02:56:29,900
you know more than I know I'm
capable of more than what I've done.

2727
02:56:29,960 --> 02:56:34,460
I'm going to do more. I'm going to
get after it harder. That's the,

2728
02:56:34,461 --> 02:56:37,550
that's what I take away from this.
These kind of books obviously besides,

2729
02:56:37,551 --> 02:56:41,420
there's incredible tactical lessons in
there. There's incredible leadership.

2730
02:56:41,630 --> 02:56:44,620
There's incredible, but that
the, the testament of cumin will,

2731
02:56:44,670 --> 02:56:49,220
is income is unbelievable.
Unbelievable Testament.

2732
02:56:50,290 --> 02:56:52,430
Yeah.
So now I feel like,

2733
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:57,850
or it seems like you knew that when
we're faced or when I'm faced with like,

2734
02:56:57,890 --> 02:57:02,240
oh, this is too hard, or, Dang, I got all
this ahead of me to, I got to do all this,

2735
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:05,640
all really,
all that is now looking at it.

2736
02:57:05,650 --> 02:57:10,650
It seems like all it is is a
deviation from my habitual comfort.

2737
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:14,060
That's all it is.
And I'll tell you what was awesome.

2738
02:57:14,061 --> 02:57:17,570
The way that he reinforced it reinforced
several times because people talk about

2739
02:57:17,571 --> 02:57:20,660
fear. I've talked about fear
on this podcast before, but
you know, I kind of say,

2740
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:22,700
Hey, take action. If you're
afraid, you've got to step into it.

2741
02:57:22,780 --> 02:57:25,730
And she said that over and over again.
He actually had a methodology. Okay,

2742
02:57:25,731 --> 02:57:28,850
if I'm afraid I'm gonna, I'm gonna
get my, I'm going to stand up.

2743
02:57:28,851 --> 02:57:31,370
I'm going to get a record. I'm gonna find
out what's going on and I'm gonna get,

2744
02:57:31,371 --> 02:57:32,960
I'm going to,
I'm going to find out.

2745
02:57:33,200 --> 02:57:36,980
I'm going to assess the situation
before my boss calls me.

2746
02:57:36,981 --> 02:57:41,000
That's my timeline that I'm working on.
And that forces them to take action.

2747
02:57:41,030 --> 02:57:44,960
You know, so many, so many
great lessons learned in there.

2748
02:57:47,090 --> 02:57:51,620
Well yeah, I feel like, yeah, we can
transition over to used to support.

2749
02:57:52,100 --> 02:57:53,360
We'll, yeah, if we want, if people,

2750
02:57:53,361 --> 02:57:55,250
if people do want to support
the podcast out there,

2751
02:57:55,251 --> 02:57:58,400
I guess you could if you're in the
mood of how to do that. Uh, yeah.

2752
02:57:58,430 --> 02:58:03,420
So the first way, and this is kind
of a two way street, you know,

2753
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:08,400
um, okay on its supplements, right?
Supplements, all kinds of cool stuff.

2754
02:58:08,401 --> 02:58:12,450
In fact, my friend from quiet Cameron,
he hit me up and was like, Hey,

2755
02:58:12,451 --> 02:58:16,570
what's on it has this,
it's a new uh,

2756
02:58:16,600 --> 02:58:20,190
preworkout you know,
but it's non stimulant.

2757
02:58:20,191 --> 02:58:23,640
Usually preworkouts crush up a bunch
of Phaedra and these feed it to you.

2758
02:58:24,450 --> 02:58:26,190
They don't actually do that,
but it seems like they do,

2759
02:58:27,150 --> 02:58:29,760
I'm not saying that's all a bad thing,
but it's not like healthy, you know?

2760
02:58:29,761 --> 02:58:33,720
So anyway, this one is like a healthy
one is like nonstimulant who's check? Oh,

2761
02:58:33,780 --> 02:58:36,180
I got, I just got it.
Haven't tried it yet,

2762
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:39,270
but I'm going to get a report
back to us once you've tried it.

2763
02:58:40,110 --> 02:58:42,480
But if you're into like,
you know,

2764
02:58:42,481 --> 02:58:45,390
sometimes you go on the website and you
get like caught up reading all the cool

2765
02:58:45,391 --> 02:58:46,890
stuff and all this stuff like that.

2766
02:58:46,920 --> 02:58:50,610
It's on there so you can look at it and
see how good you actually mentioned that

2767
02:58:50,611 --> 02:58:52,980
a lot. How you go to the
Onnit website and you know,

2768
02:58:53,820 --> 02:58:58,770
I maybe I just don't do as thorough
research as you when it comes to checking

2769
02:58:58,771 --> 02:59:00,680
out where my krill oil comes from.
But sure,

2770
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:02,580
I know what I'm looking
for it and I go do it.

2771
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:06,810
But if you're more like echo and you
want to spend time on the website reading

2772
02:59:06,811 --> 02:59:07,644
and researching,

2773
02:59:07,810 --> 02:59:11,190
it's a good place to do is on [inaudible]
dot com throw a slash Jocko on there.

2774
02:59:11,190 --> 02:59:13,190

and they're selling it as a,
I dunno,

2780
02:59:31,560 --> 02:59:34,080
it's Krill vasodilator
or something like this.

2781
02:59:34,280 --> 02:59:38,580
It's not that big words echo

2784
02:59:47,760 --> 02:59:52,530
Everyday carry every day. Every everyday
consumption. Everyday consumption.

2785

I like that. Right Buddy? See Yeah.

2786
02:59:54,570 --> 02:59:59,430
Krill oil took that today already out
for brain. That's like every other day.

2787
02:59:59,790 --> 03:00:02,780
It depends on PODC.
Yeah.

2788
03:00:02,790 --> 03:00:07,080
Get on Alpha brain every day.
Some people take it every day.

2789
03:00:07,650 --> 03:00:11,840
Some people take shroom tech every day.
Yeah. I take from tech when needed. Yeah.

2790
03:00:12,060 --> 03:00:16,620
When anticipated needed Krill oil
everyday. Krill oil every day for sure.

2791
03:00:16,621 --> 03:00:19,800
Without question. Strong
bone everyday. Yeah.

2792
03:00:19,830 --> 03:00:23,340
I got this peanut butter
or your bar when needed.

2793
03:00:24,450 --> 03:00:29,450
I've been having one every two every day
for the past four days because it's so

2794
03:00:29,970 --> 03:00:31,380
easy.
Oh,

2795
03:00:31,381 --> 03:00:33,810
I want to eat something healthy and
that tastes good and then we'll kind of

2796
03:00:33,811 --> 03:00:36,690
hungry and I want to get it really
quickly without having to do anything but

2797
03:00:36,691 --> 03:00:38,730
peel open a rapper, boom,
warrior bars in the house,

2798
03:00:40,790 --> 03:00:42,420
no guarantee.
But yeah,

2799
03:00:42,421 --> 03:00:44,850
there's some cool stuff and I got
this peanut butter peanut butter,

2800
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:49,470
cashew almond and I don't know
something else, but it's real good.

2801
03:00:50,730 --> 03:00:55,560
It's real core to MCT oil.
It's all up in there anyway.

2802
03:00:55,620 --> 03:00:58,350
Good stuff. Trying to of
MCT oil too, by the way.

2803
03:00:59,110 --> 03:01:04,110
I take the coconut MCT oil from on it
and I mixed it with heavy whipping cream.

2804
03:01:04,210 --> 03:01:06,760
I don't, yeah, I don't do
that until it's whipped cream.

2805
03:01:07,090 --> 03:01:09,070
I just pour it in a little bit in there.

2806
03:01:09,220 --> 03:01:13,240
I stirred up and I drink heavy
whipping cream, which is just all fat,

2807
03:01:13,570 --> 03:01:18,150
which is awesome with MCT, which is more
fat and I didn't drink all that. Yeah,

2808
03:01:18,190 --> 03:01:23,050
and it's a good fat. It's good
fat, but it also, it's, it's very,

2809
03:01:23,051 --> 03:01:27,370
very fulfilling. Very, very notes.
But I'm not, I'm talking, I almost,

2810
03:01:27,430 --> 03:01:30,490
it's a little bit big when I have little
glasses that I mix it in there bigger

2811
03:01:30,491 --> 03:01:34,780
than a shot glass,
but they're smaller than a cocktail glass.

2812
03:01:35,140 --> 03:01:38,230
It's called the rocks glass
perhaps in the bar industry.

2813
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:42,590
You know more about that stuff.
Yeah, it's bigger than MCT.

2814
03:01:43,460 --> 03:01:47,830
I mean not to go into all the fats and
good feathers, but it's more fulfilling.

2815
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:49,990
Fat has nine calories per gram.

2816
03:01:50,500 --> 03:01:54,790
Carbohydrates and protein
have for alcohol. Seven

2817
03:01:56,290 --> 03:02:00,790
little trivia. I was not aware of that.
Yeah, it's all good. Alcohol is not,

2818
03:02:00,791 --> 03:02:04,200
I don't think they still icon on
it, so you're all good there. Um,

2819
03:02:04,270 --> 03:02:05,103
but that's a good way.

2820
03:02:05,200 --> 03:02:09,100
I feel like I'm repeating
it on it.com/jocko but if
you do want the 10% off,

2821
03:02:09,101 --> 03:02:12,010
you got to add the slash Jocko if
you want to put, pay the full price,

2822
03:02:12,011 --> 03:02:16,660
which is cool too by the way.
Just go on and.com anyway,

2823
03:02:16,750 --> 03:02:21,250
another way to support, if you're in
the mood to support the Amazon link,

2824
03:02:21,310 --> 03:02:25,330
click through. It's Christmas.
Chris coming. Christmas is
coming up. What is today?

2825
03:02:26,020 --> 03:02:30,190
Whatever the date is today,
Christmas coming up. We then

2826
03:02:30,191 --> 03:02:33,850
two weeks, whatever. Anyway, and when you
do your shopping, if you're like, Hey,

2827
03:02:33,851 --> 03:02:38,080
I'm going to shop for Christmas for
my friends, family, whatever, and

2828
03:02:40,360 --> 03:02:43,810
it's in your mind that you want to
support podcast, just go to our website,

2829
03:02:44,080 --> 03:02:48,640
[inaudible] dot com or Jocko Jocko,
podcast.com a lot of people ask me,

2830
03:02:49,330 --> 03:02:51,910
hey, where are your favorite
books that you've read?

2831
03:02:51,910 --> 03:02:54,370
Can you send us a list of
those? And I said, yeah,

2832
03:02:54,371 --> 03:02:59,371
go to www.jockopodcast.com all the books
that we've talked about on the podcast,

2833
03:02:59,950 --> 03:03:04,510
the book that I read today, go and buy
it. Yeah. Going by it colder than hell.

2834
03:03:04,830 --> 03:03:09,760
A Marine Rifle Company at chosen
reservoir by Joseph are Owen. Buy It.

2835
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:14,320
Read it. I could've, I could've
just read the entire book on Air.

2836
03:03:14,560 --> 03:03:17,860
Obviously I'm not going to do that,
but take a long time.

2837
03:03:17,980 --> 03:03:21,370
It would take a long time,
but there's so much stuff that I,

2838
03:03:21,730 --> 03:03:24,580
that I absolutely had to skip and say,
you know,

2839
03:03:24,581 --> 03:03:26,390
I was like struggling with myself going,

2840
03:03:26,800 --> 03:03:30,970
I used up most of a highlighter
and a half highlighting this book,

2841
03:03:31,510 --> 03:03:36,220
so you order this book,
you will have it on the website.

2842
03:03:36,330 --> 03:03:40,120
It's page. All of them are on there.
Yeah, on the pit you go top menu,

2843
03:03:40,350 --> 03:03:42,910
you know books from the podcast,
I think it's called.

2844
03:03:42,910 --> 03:03:46,510
You Click on it and there's links
directly to Amazon. Yeah, play out. Boom.

2845
03:03:46,540 --> 03:03:48,970
There's another way to support, but
it's all Amazon. You Click through a,

2846
03:03:48,980 --> 03:03:50,710
if you guys just doing regular shopping,

2847
03:03:50,840 --> 03:03:52,540
there's a banner on the
kind of the right side.

2848
03:03:52,541 --> 03:03:55,730
You Click through there
and do your shopping and it
supports the podcasts to two

2849
03:03:56,110 --> 03:03:59,290
birds, one kind of thing. Anyway,

2850
03:03:59,510 --> 03:04:03,500
also you can subscribe
to the podcast on iTunes.

2851
03:04:04,100 --> 03:04:08,480

you already mentioned this. Oh,

2852
03:04:08,481 --> 03:04:13,190
we got on the top podcasts of 2016 list.

2853

great to their youtube, not youtube,

2854
03:04:18,710 --> 03:04:19,160

2855
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:24,160
We were on the top podcasts of 2016
list from iTunes is your statement,

2856
03:04:24,830 --> 03:04:28,370

in my head because when you subscribe,

2857
03:04:29,180 --> 03:04:33,110
you subscribe on Itunes, leave
a review. If you're in the mood,

2858
03:04:34,780 --> 03:04:37,990
actually leave a review
and make sure it's awesome.

2859
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:42,370
Not Awesome in terms of good, but just
make sure that it's fun for me to read.

2860
03:04:43,330 --> 03:04:45,640
That will invoke more,
uh,

2861
03:04:45,730 --> 03:04:50,470
the will to read or if it's not fun to
read some good points that you like or

2862
03:04:50,471 --> 03:04:54,880
don't like. And yeah, I like
reading those reviews. I do,

2863
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:57,670
I read every single review,
so I'm reading them.

2864
03:04:57,940 --> 03:05:01,990
It's good to check. Yeah, yeah.

2865
03:05:02,010 --> 03:05:06,810
And make sure we're delivering. Yeah,

2872
03:05:31,770 --> 03:05:36,030
Also, we have a store, Jocko is a
store, it's called Jocko store.com.

2873
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:41,270
So if everyone, we all wear clothes tee
shirts, right. Why not make it a jacket?

2874
03:05:41,280 --> 03:05:45,750
The shirt, that's kind of the,
the thing, you know, it's,

2875
03:05:46,690 --> 03:05:50,250
it's a thing, you know, how's this? So
Chris, I don't know if I showed you this.

2876
03:05:50,310 --> 03:05:53,730
So Chris Rue is our
friend fellow black belt.

2877
03:05:53,990 --> 03:05:57,240
He's that I want to see a art,
I don't even know the whole story.

2878
03:05:57,450 --> 03:05:59,970
I was trying to call him. He
was like, oh, but there's no,

2879
03:05:59,971 --> 03:06:03,030
I totally know this story. Yeah. So yeah,

2880
03:06:03,031 --> 03:06:07,800
he's the one of the,
one of the cadets at West Point.

2881
03:06:08,070 --> 03:06:10,020
Yeah. So, um,

2882
03:06:10,780 --> 03:06:14,530
he's, I don't know how, do you know
how he saw how he saw him or whatever,

2883
03:06:14,590 --> 03:06:17,170
but a cadet at west
point and I don't have,

2884
03:06:17,171 --> 03:06:20,380
I don't have his name right now in
uniform. Yeah. Yeah. He's in uniform.

2885
03:06:20,381 --> 03:06:21,910
But the uniform that they wear,
it's cold up there.

2886
03:06:21,911 --> 03:06:24,260
So then basically it's like a giant Cape.

2887
03:06:25,120 --> 03:06:30,070
And underneath the Cape he had a, uh, a
Jocko podcast shirt on. He had actually,

2888
03:06:30,400 --> 03:06:33,880
he actually had the straight up
Jocko face on that thing and it was,

2889
03:06:33,980 --> 03:06:36,520
he said he posted an awesome
picture on social media of him,

2890
03:06:36,670 --> 03:06:40,360
of him pulling up his
cape and he had that that

2891
03:06:41,210 --> 03:06:41,640
okay.

2892
03:06:41,640 --> 03:06:43,800
That tee shirt on. Yeah. Chuck Lewis face.

2893
03:06:44,130 --> 03:06:47,670
Maybe that was the secret weapon that
led the army to the first victory,

2894
03:06:47,790 --> 03:06:52,290
I think 14 years over navy and football.
Tom, Neil, Tom the, Oh yes, he's the,

2895
03:06:52,291 --> 03:06:56,190
he was the cadet doing it.
Yeah. Sending in the wild

2896
03:06:56,830 --> 03:07:00,140
in the wild. Doubling the oil. Yeah. Well
that's, he gave y'all in the wild. That's,

2897
03:07:00,330 --> 03:07:02,100
I mean I don't know what
the regulations are,

2898
03:07:02,130 --> 03:07:05,220
but I'm fairly certain that the t shirt,

2899
03:07:05,250 --> 03:07:08,850
the Jocko podcast tee shirt is not part
of army regulations something unless it

2900
03:07:08,851 --> 03:07:12,960
is now. I'm just saying, I never
know perhaps. But yeah, he's been,

2901
03:07:12,961 --> 03:07:14,670
he's been actually in touch

2902
03:07:16,260 --> 03:07:19,980
before he went to west point. He
was, when he was getting ready to go,

2903
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:24,240
he was like reaching out and he was
getting after it. Right. And go crush it.

2904
03:07:24,300 --> 03:07:28,550
Doing this point. So good for him to some
Gnocchis Jujitsu as well. True, true.

2905
03:07:28,551 --> 03:07:33,440
Chris [inaudible] dot com. That's
where you can get like cool shirts, uh,

2906
03:07:33,480 --> 03:07:36,000
discipline equals freedom,
you know, all these things.

2907
03:07:36,060 --> 03:07:38,070
And also women's stuff on there.
Some hoodies on there,

2908
03:07:38,071 --> 03:07:42,240
some rash guards on there for,
for some activity.

2909
03:07:42,990 --> 03:07:45,990
You know what I'm talking about?
And some patches on there,

2910
03:07:45,991 --> 03:07:50,910
the regulation one within the
velcro that's um, that's on there.

2911
03:07:50,920 --> 03:07:54,780
Some other stuff. So yeah, go on there,
look at it. You don't have to buy nothing.

2912
03:07:55,170 --> 03:07:57,930
Just look at it. If you like
something, go ahead. Get it.

2913
03:07:58,590 --> 03:08:01,860
Good way to support and
boom, you got a shirt. Um,

2914
03:08:03,180 --> 03:08:08,040
also, okay, so here's the thing.
And this started a while ago. Okay.

2915
03:08:08,041 --> 03:08:12,210
So I'll tell this story,
I'll keep it short, but,

2916
03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:17,460
so I was like, I don't have echo
went rogue again, basically. Yeah.

2917
03:08:17,461 --> 03:08:21,300
So, and it started with kind
of nothing, so, you know, okay,

2918
03:08:21,330 --> 03:08:26,250
we're talking about luxury and like,
okay, fine, I only got six hours sleep.

2919
03:08:26,251 --> 03:08:29,130
I'm usually used to eight and a half
or something like that. Right. So,

2920
03:08:29,280 --> 03:08:33,210
but I know I can do a workout and I
know you don't get that much sleep or if

2921
03:08:33,211 --> 03:08:35,550
you're tired or not tired of what a,
you still push through the workout.

2922
03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:40,230
But I'm thinking, yeah, yeah, your hard,
your money, whatever. But you got to,

2923
03:08:40,380 --> 03:08:45,330
there has to be times where you got to
basically talk yourself into it basically.

2924
03:08:47,520 --> 03:08:51,470
So I'm like, all right, like
what do you say? You got to,
you know, be honest. Like,

2925
03:08:51,480 --> 03:08:56,160
what do you say? You know, to
yourself. And I figured it would have,

2926
03:08:57,450 --> 03:08:59,820
you know, like a lot of the stuff that
you can always say like, you know,

2927
03:09:00,170 --> 03:09:03,960
we have this luxury and all this
stuff. I'm like, all right, but let me,

2928
03:09:04,530 --> 03:09:09,300
so I asked you and what you told
me. I was like, okay, that, um,

2929
03:09:10,410 --> 03:09:14,610
that was good. It was legit right
there. So, and, and it worked.

2930
03:09:14,670 --> 03:09:18,880
It totally worked. Um,
so what I did, you know,

2931
03:09:19,410 --> 03:09:21,600
one thing led to another kind of in
my head, so I was like, all right,

2932
03:09:21,601 --> 03:09:23,910
you know what we're going to do?
We're going to record that.

2933
03:09:23,970 --> 03:09:27,690
You're going to say that I'm going
to record it. And on top of that,

2934
03:09:27,870 --> 03:09:31,860
not just the working out and usually like
with food and stuff like donuts and I

2935
03:09:31,861 --> 03:09:34,860
joke around that I eat like whole
things of Oreos because they, how I,

2936
03:09:34,910 --> 03:09:39,420
that's just a joke. Like sometimes I do,
but you do. Yeah, but I have willpower.

2937
03:09:39,440 --> 03:09:43,470
Like that's not a problem with, but
um, some people don't. So I'm like,

2938
03:09:43,920 --> 03:09:44,900
yeah,
the,

2939
03:09:44,970 --> 03:09:49,950
if that workout thing that you just
said could apply to like all these other

2940
03:09:49,951 --> 03:09:54,460
things, we're going to record that too.
Then you start thinking and you know,

2941
03:09:54,790 --> 03:09:57,400
a lot of people have been saying,
hey, what about like a ringtone?

2942
03:09:57,401 --> 03:10:01,090
You should ever ringtones w you know,
for my alarm and all this stuff.

2943
03:10:01,091 --> 03:10:04,540
So I'm like, all right, well basically
one thing led to another, we recorded them

2944
03:10:06,280 --> 03:10:10,750
and I put them on iTunes,
called it psychological warfare.

2945
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:17,230
Good move. I think on my, it's on
iTunes. Yes, on iTunes. It's like,

2946
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:19,250
yeah. So we're trying to, here's the,

2947
03:10:19,290 --> 03:10:22,090
so this kind of ties it back to how
you can support the podcast look.

2948
03:10:22,091 --> 03:10:26,380
So we hit about eight to 10
birds with one stone with this,

2949
03:10:27,130 --> 03:10:31,180
it's 99 cents for a track or you can buy
like the whole fancy and was like 1314

2950
03:10:31,181 --> 03:10:32,680
tracks on there for nine bucks.

2951
03:10:32,680 --> 03:10:37,490
I think that's kind of standard and but
so that's how much I put it or I listed

2952
03:10:37,491 --> 03:10:40,160
it as um, and you just download
it. You put it as your ring.

2953
03:10:40,390 --> 03:10:42,970
There's one for waking up. Actually
there's two for waking up. Right.

2954
03:10:42,971 --> 03:10:47,950
So you scan your foot reefer
waking up maybe. Yeah. But
there's a few, in my mind,

2955
03:10:47,951 --> 03:10:51,820
I pictured people like, Oh, you want to
wake up? Cool. We can come down on that.

2956
03:10:52,120 --> 03:10:55,480
I go through that every day
waking up. So yeah, we'll do that.

2957
03:10:56,230 --> 03:10:57,820
It's of like a song that you could buy.

2958
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:02,650
It's like a song that you could
buy on iTunes. Howard album. Yes.

2959
03:11:02,651 --> 03:11:04,750
Same process. You just,
yeah, you just don't know.

2960
03:11:04,751 --> 03:11:07,900
You can buy one track d tracks or
the whole thing wouldn't handle it.

2961
03:11:07,920 --> 03:11:12,910
I mean it's 99 cents. So it's
not like you're supporting
the podcast. Yes, exactly.

2962
03:11:12,910 --> 03:11:15,100
Right. Here's, here's a little
tip. I was thinking about though.

2963
03:11:15,370 --> 03:11:19,150
So you need your wake up. There's
like a few wakeup ones, right?

2964
03:11:19,320 --> 03:11:24,320
I mentioned that if you put that as your
alarm cleared with your wife or whoever

2965
03:11:26,261 --> 03:11:28,740
you're sleeping with,
I'll tell you right now if that thing,

2966
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:32,920
but if she don't know about it and
that comes on, it'll freak her out man.

2967
03:11:33,270 --> 03:11:37,870
So do that. That's a little pro tip
right there if he's in it, but I will,

2968
03:11:37,900 --> 03:11:41,170
I will almost,
I'll say it's 100% guarantee if you're,

2969
03:11:41,171 --> 03:11:43,360
if you felt like how I felt with workouts,

2970
03:11:43,361 --> 03:11:47,710
like I'm really not in the mood to go
do a workout and you listened to the

2971
03:11:47,711 --> 03:11:51,820
workout one, I will say with 100%
certainty you will not skip the work.

2972
03:11:52,630 --> 03:11:55,390
I'll say that right now as a legit anyway,

2973
03:11:56,020 --> 03:12:00,010
psychological warfare.
Who's the agonist?

2974
03:12:00,040 --> 03:12:01,920
I think it's just a willing,
okay.

2975
03:12:02,320 --> 03:12:06,010
I think cause that's how they list them
by artists, right? Yeah, I think so.

2976
03:12:06,050 --> 03:12:10,120
Did I just that just become
an artist. That's scary.
Let's call it something else.

2977
03:12:10,121 --> 03:12:11,770
You kind of got,
can I use you something else?

2978
03:12:11,771 --> 03:12:16,480
You kind of got and pushed into
it though. So you know, artists,

2979
03:12:16,510 --> 03:12:19,540
author,
a podcaster technically.

2980
03:12:19,570 --> 03:12:22,620
Is that a thing at the happy I heard it.
You know what?

2981
03:12:22,850 --> 03:12:27,230
I can give you the heads up. Three,
I'm over here being an artist.

2982
03:12:27,280 --> 03:12:30,520
What happened? Okay, but it's all
you know wrong. Not going to happen.

2983
03:12:30,810 --> 03:12:35,810
It's offered good cause though I'm
telling you because if anyone's like I am,

2984
03:12:36,341 --> 03:12:39,340
which I'm, I'm straight up. It's
more than an assumption. I'm,

2985
03:12:39,670 --> 03:12:44,140
I am of the belief that some people are
like me in that way where you just don't

2986
03:12:44,141 --> 03:12:47,220
feel like it. I know we just read
this and now we all feel like it.

2987
03:12:47,230 --> 03:12:50,200
I understand that. But you don't
have that feeling every single day.

2988
03:12:51,300 --> 03:12:52,010
I'm telling you right

2989
03:12:52,010 --> 03:12:56,540
now. This helps. This helps you get
after it helped me for sure. Anyway,

2990
03:12:56,570 --> 03:13:00,090
psychological warfare,
you know, all right.

2991
03:13:00,410 --> 03:13:05,240
Also Hae on iTunes or sorry,
not an iTunes bought on Amazon.

2992
03:13:05,600 --> 03:13:08,990
You can get some white tea.
It's like I said,

2993
03:13:09,410 --> 03:13:11,570
we're working through
the supply chain issues,

2994
03:13:11,571 --> 03:13:15,770
but it's been popping up every couple
of days. They refill. You can order it.

2995
03:13:16,130 --> 03:13:17,060
It tastes good.

2996
03:13:17,420 --> 03:13:22,420
And it makes you feel good and it will
increase your dead lift capabilities to a

2997
03:13:24,441 --> 03:13:29,090
minimum of 7,000 pounds.
Many are getting up to 8,000 pounds,

2998
03:13:29,110 --> 03:13:30,790
headless from drinking
chocolate white tea.

2999
03:13:31,580 --> 03:13:35,690
You can get up and get after it
Mug by the way too. So those are,

3000
03:13:35,840 --> 03:13:39,680
they're bigger than normal. I'll say
that they're bigger than a normal mug.

3001
03:13:39,760 --> 03:13:44,540
A normal mug is not as big as it
get after it mug with every sip,

3002
03:13:44,600 --> 03:13:49,400
like you're acting, you're doing
bicep curls, you're getting, actually,

3003
03:13:49,401 --> 03:13:54,400
that's not my joke. I could steal
that from Twitter. So that's that. Uh,

3004
03:13:54,590 --> 03:13:58,100
also on Amazon, you can pick up colder
than hell. The book I read today do it.

3005
03:13:58,490 --> 03:14:00,830
Put it in your collection of Badass books.

3006
03:14:01,250 --> 03:14:04,640
You can pick up another book
that's called extreme ownership.

3007
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:07,730
That's written by me and
my brother Leif Babin.

3008
03:14:08,810 --> 03:14:11,390
It is also a book that's about combat,

3009
03:14:11,391 --> 03:14:14,180
but it's more of a book about leadership.

3010
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:18,980
And if you want to give some work,
speaking of the holiday season,

3011
03:14:20,180 --> 03:14:22,730
if you want to give someone
a gift that's gonna,

3012
03:14:22,760 --> 03:14:24,380
you know some gifts that you get,

3013
03:14:25,220 --> 03:14:29,360
they go in the drawer that
doesn't get opened anymore, right?

3014
03:14:29,420 --> 03:14:31,490
And then it takes you a couple of
years and you're finally throw it away.

3015
03:14:32,540 --> 03:14:35,970
Don't give that gift the gift
that someone's going to say,

3016
03:14:37,490 --> 03:14:41,450
you gave me that book, it's legit. I
read it. Oh, I implemented this. Hey,

3017
03:14:41,451 --> 03:14:42,560
what'd you think about the good?

3018
03:14:42,590 --> 03:14:47,540
Give them a gift that's gonna have
long term value, longterm value.

3019
03:14:47,720 --> 03:14:51,850
Give him a little book called
extreme ownership. You can
get it on amazon.com uh,

3020
03:14:52,310 --> 03:14:52,610
hey.

3021
03:14:52,610 --> 03:14:57,610
Speaking of extreme ownership also we got
the muster number two zero zero to May

3022
03:14:59,090 --> 03:15:01,220
4th and fifth at the Marriott
Marquis in New York City.

3023
03:15:01,221 --> 03:15:03,320
Now the last one that we had,

3024
03:15:03,500 --> 03:15:06,980
we had people from 42 different states.

3025
03:15:07,010 --> 03:15:12,010
We had people from five foreign countries
and we had leaders at every level of

3026
03:15:12,771 --> 03:15:17,420
the chain of command in every size
business that you could imagine.

3027
03:15:17,450 --> 03:15:22,450
So it was a super diverse group of
people that are all together with,

3028
03:15:22,790 --> 03:15:27,230
they had one similarity in that is
they want to get better and crush it in

3029
03:15:27,231 --> 03:15:29,210
leadership,
in their business and in their life.

3030
03:15:30,260 --> 03:15:35,260
So that's what we do at the mustard
leaf and I who are there obviously when,

3031
03:15:36,130 --> 03:15:37,040
when I say we're there,

3032
03:15:37,940 --> 03:15:40,970
I don't mean where their meaning we're
in the same building but were hiding

3033
03:15:40,971 --> 03:15:43,730
somewhere. No, no, no, no. Where
there we are actually with you.

3034
03:15:43,840 --> 03:15:47,570
We are sitting down with
you. We are talking. We are,

3035
03:15:47,840 --> 03:15:51,060
we're not hiding behind the curtain.
We don't even have a backstage.

3036
03:15:51,120 --> 03:15:53,340
They said well where do you want
your backstage or we don't need one.

3037
03:15:54,270 --> 03:15:58,380
We're not going backstage. Yeah.
People want to come and talk and learn.

3038
03:15:58,440 --> 03:16:01,320
We want to learn from them.
So come and get it.

3039
03:16:01,620 --> 03:16:03,720
I've said this every time
this is going to sell out,

3040
03:16:04,590 --> 03:16:06,150
it's going to sell out and
then you won't be able to go.

3041
03:16:06,480 --> 03:16:11,250
And also the prices are going up.
So as you get close to the event,

3042
03:16:11,370 --> 03:16:12,570
the prices go up.

3043
03:16:12,571 --> 03:16:16,890
The reason we do that is so we incentivize
you to buy the tickets now so that we

3044
03:16:16,891 --> 03:16:21,360
can plan better, right? We like to be
planned, we planned and we prepare things.

3045
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:24,900
If all of you sign up,
you know,

3046
03:16:25,740 --> 03:16:29,490
April 22nd we got some logistics prompts.

3047
03:16:29,490 --> 03:16:32,220
I don't want to be in the same boat
I'm in with Jocko white tea where I've

3048
03:16:32,550 --> 03:16:36,840
failed logistically and it takes
me a while to get it back on track.

3049
03:16:36,870 --> 03:16:38,100
So sign up early,

3050
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:41,640
save yourself some money and let
us be better prepared for that.

3051
03:16:41,730 --> 03:16:42,570

3056

3057
03:17:09,961 --> 03:17:14,310

of hang out with us virtually.

3058
03:17:14,760 --> 03:17:19,760
Well Echo and I are both kind of
cruising the cruising the interwebs.

3059
03:17:20,790 --> 03:17:23,190

3066
03:17:56,390 --> 03:18:00,120
do
execute.

3067
03:18:02,010 --> 03:18:07,010
Take a look at your life and see where
you can apply the kinder human will we

3068
03:18:09,511 --> 03:18:10,470
heard about tonight.

3069
03:18:12,020 --> 03:18:17,020
They're kind of human will that
overcomes challenges and obstacles.

3070
03:18:18,380 --> 03:18:23,380
Whether you're fighting a war or you're
fighting a fire or you're fighting

3071
03:18:23,990 --> 03:18:26,990
crime,
or you're building a bridge,

3072
03:18:27,140 --> 03:18:29,630
or you're building a piece of software,

3073
03:18:29,750 --> 03:18:34,750
or whether you're doing
HVAC work or retail work,

3074
03:18:35,730 --> 03:18:40,730
or whether you're healing
kids or you're teaching kids,

3075
03:18:43,250 --> 03:18:45,740
no matter what you are doing,

3076
03:18:47,110 --> 03:18:50,080
what can you do to do it better?

3077
03:18:51,820 --> 03:18:55,150
What can you do to make you better?

3078
03:18:58,140 --> 03:19:00,900
Ask yourself that question.

3079
03:19:01,530 --> 03:19:04,260
Apply that will

3080
03:19:07,280 --> 03:19:08,270
and get after it.

3081
03:19:12,060 --> 03:19:13,710
So until next time,

3082
03:19:15,030 --> 03:19:17,100

3083
03:19:18,810 --> 03:19:19,030
