00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:06,340
This is Jocko podcast number
one 22 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,100
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:16,780
and if you have not listened to episode
one 21 the previous episode to this one,

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,580
go listen to it before listening to this
web episode or even the next episode.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,930
They are all linked together and that's
why we released them all at the same

6
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:30,764
time.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,920
This episode picks up where
the last episode left off.

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:41,350
This episode is about the story of chesty
puller son Louis B polar junior and we

9
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:51,611
will be learning about Lou polar junior
from his audio autobiography which is

10
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:57,950
entitled Fortunate Son.

11
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,420
It is a Pulitzer Prize winning book
about his life growing up with his father

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,740
and his experiences when
he joined the Marine Corps,

13
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,770
served as a platoon commander in Vietnam
and about his life upon his return from

14
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:19,010
the war and the struggles that he faced.

15
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,080
Let's go to the book.

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,190
I first noticed my father's tattoo this
summer. He returned from the Korean War.

17
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,600
We had just moved from Virginia to the
Marine base at Camp Pendleton. California.

18
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:42,280
Mother had asked me to awaken him from
an afternoon nap and as I entered their

19
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,590
bedroom and stood beside
his sleeping figure,

20
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:49,591
my eyes were drawn to the Blue Globe
and its anchor on his right upper arm.

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,160
When I extended my hand to trace
the outline with my finger,

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:59,310
he awakened and acquiesce and acquiescing
to the curiosity of a five year old.

23
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:04,890
He playfully flexed his bicep and
tussled my hair with his free left hand.

24
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,410
I had no idea that the object of my
fascination was the emblem of the Marine

25
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,190
Corps,

26
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,190
the organization to which my father had
already dedicated more than 30 of his 53

27
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:18,814
years.

28
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,750
I did know that it must be important
because my mother had a piece of gold and

29
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:28,690
silver jewelry in the shape of my
father's tattoo and she wore at frequently

30
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,860
when she got dressed up.

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:36,420
Later I learned that mother loved the
Golden Silver Pin and despised the tattoo.

32
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,140
There were other things I noticed about
my father and the summer and fall of

33
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:46,141
1951 a time during which he made a special
effort to be accessible to his only

34
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:51,460
son and to make up for his
absence during the war.

35
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,290
My father had been promoted to the rank
of brigadier general after leading the

36
00:02:56,291 --> 00:03:00,190
First Marine regiment of the First
Marine Division in the retreat from the

37
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:05,191
chosen reservoir through Cotu re just
before Christmas 1950 the breakout came to

38
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:11,650
be regarded as a classic in the annals
of modern military modern American

39
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:16,030
military warfare for his role in holding
together the rear guard during some of

40
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,980
the bloodiest fighting of the war.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,930
My father was recognized for his heroic
leadership and his elevation to flag

42
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:27,190
rank was assured
after the engagement ended.

43
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:31,810
Mother told me father had escaped
from a trap set by the red Chinese,

44
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,920
but I could not envision his being
caught in a device similar to the one I

45
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:39,910
baited with lettuce and the apple
orchard behind my grandmother's home in

46
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:42,790
Virginia where we waited out the war.

47
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,630
He had sent me warm a mentos to Korean
swords and enemy helmet and Bugle and

48
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,770
several metals which arrived
in silk lined blue boxes,

49
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,700
affectionately known among his beloved
Marines as the old man or chesty for the

50
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:01,540
way he carried himself when marching.

51
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,400
He must have known that combat taking
place on the frozen waste waste in ridges

52
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:11,170
of Korea would be his last and even
then he was passing on to me the proud

53
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:15,610
traditions of his profession.
For my sixth birthday,

54
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,390
near the end of the summer,
he gave me a 22 caliber single shot rifle,

55
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:23,470
which he had modified by sawing the
stock and half to accommodate my narrow

56
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,650
shoulders and short arms on the butt.

57
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,860
He had stencilled my name Louis
be polar jr and added the end.

58
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:37,341
The added touch filled me with pride of
ownership and a certainty that I had the

59
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:40,000
best father in the world.

60
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,850
After we had practiced on
paper targets and tin cans,

61
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,710
he took me into the Brown hills around
our home in search of California Jack

62
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,230
Rabbits. At first I struggled
to matches long legged gate,

63
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,930
but after he realized
that I could not keep up,

64
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,470
he slowed his pace and began
circumventing the steeper hills.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,410
Even then I tired easily and my aching
legs diverted my attention from our

66
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,470
elusive quarry throughout the several
months that we hunted together and Camp

67
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,380
Pendleton countryside. I never once
came close to hitting a rabbit,

68
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,460
but my father puffed silently on
his pipe pipe each time I missed.

69
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,770
And on those occasions when he bagged
game, I was allowed to carry our trophies.

70
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,280
The last hundred yards back home

71
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,260
in early February is my twin sister.

72
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,060
Martha and I were beginning
of the second half,

73
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,270
half of our first year of grade
school and our older sister,

74
00:05:36,271 --> 00:05:38,940
Virginia was seemingly
an adult sixth grader.

75
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,440
A parade was held to honor my father's
heroism at the chosen reservoir.

76
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:48,240
I was permitted to go along with mother
and she held my hand as we stood at the

77
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:53,241
end of a sun drenched parade ground and
waited for the ceremony to end when the

78
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:57,800
last drum beat sounded and the standard
bearers had retired. The colors.

79
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,910
My father's strode from the field on
which he had just been honored and knelt

80
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,970
briefly to let me view the
object of the mornings.

81
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:09,140
Pageantry a gold star in
lieu of his fifth navy cross,

82
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:14,141
the most ever earned by any one marine
and our country sank second highest award

83
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:19,601
for valor now joined the
panoply of ribbons that
covered most of his left chest.

84
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,730
The moment of that frozen instant more
than three decades ago is this fresh and

85
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:33,311
firmly fixed in my mind today as
any of my most vivid boy had boyhood

86
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,520
recollections.

87
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,030
Okay.

88
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,841
At Camp Pendleton,

89
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:41,070
father commanded the third marine brigade
and was charged with training fresh

90
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,190
troops for the denouncement being played
out along the 38th parallel in Korea.

91
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,040
On several occasions,
he and his dream driver,

92
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,130
Sergeant Orville Jones took me with
them to observe war games and field

93
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:02,160
exercises in Pendleton Scrub,
dotted boondocks.

94
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,110
I was naturally fascinated
by the maneuvers of khaki
clad marines and the smoke

95
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:11,610
and funder of mock warfare.
So

96
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,140
it's,
it's a beautiful picture.

97
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,530
It's a beautiful picture
and he's home from war.

98
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:24,531
Luckily they must have had their kids
pretty late because he's young and you

99
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,680
know, chestie's I think 45 at
this point or something like that.

100
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:33,681
45 or 46 so had the kid had at
least Lou Louis Junior when he was,

101
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,320
I don't know, 40 or something
like that. And this is like a,

102
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:45,270
every kids you know would be
stoked on this dad. And you know,

103
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:48,930
I know when my,
when my son was like this age,

104
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,140
I would bring him sometimes to
our training sites and he would,

105
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:53,840
yeah,

106
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,720
shoot machine guns and
grenades and stuff like that.

107
00:07:56,721 --> 00:08:01,120
And he'd watch all the maneuvers.
Sorry, these, let me tell you.

108
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,470
Six year old boys, they like that kind
of thing. I promise you. All right.

109
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:10,070
Back to the book. In August, 1953 when
the crew with the Korean War ended,

110
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:14,630
father was promoted to major general and
the sign in front in our front yard was

111
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,180
repainted to reflect as new rank.

112
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,900
We had to mute our celebration because
the general who lived across the street

113
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:25,430
was not selected for promotion, but all
in all times were good in our lives.

114
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:30,020
We're happy father had
sufficiently decompressed from
his Korean War experience

115
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,160
that he was no longer making the kinds
of inflammatory statements about the

116
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:38,000
conduct of the war that had gotten him
just him into so much trouble in the past,

117
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,590
including one that haunted him for years
to the effect that whiskey and beer

118
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,950
would make troops fight better
than ice cream and soft training.

119
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:51,800
The promotion to major general was proof
that he was on track toward at least a

120
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:56,801
possible shot at becoming commandant
of the Marine Corps and fulfilling a

121
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,410
lifelong ambition.

122
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:03,330
So the commandant of the Marine Corps
is the senior ranking marine and

123
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,080
that's,
I guess

124
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,200
obviously his goal or was his goal.

125
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,893
All right.

126
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,130
He was ordered by the
commandant. Now, you know,

127
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,180
I covered some of this
and in the first book,

128
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:24,930
but he was ordered by the commandant of
the Marine Corps to report to Bethesda,

129
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,600
Maryland, Maryland naval
hospital for further evaluation.

130
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,130
After two weeks in the hospital,

131
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:32,910
he was found unfit for duty and
scheduled to go before retirement board.

132
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:36,540
In early August.
He returned home angry and bitter,

133
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,100
and perhaps because he couldn't
discuss the perceived unfairness of his

134
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:45,480
situation with his fellow marines,
he vented his frustrations on mother.

135
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,440
He had felt from the time of his illness
that a quartiere of senior officers in

136
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:57,180
the Marine Corps was jealous of a
celebrity and would use the stroke as a

137
00:09:57,181 --> 00:10:01,170
pretext to end his career. And that's
what is not mentioned in the first book,

138
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,840
is that it was a,
it was a minor stroke that he had had.

139
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,730
He viewed his summons to Bethesda
after a board had already passed on his

140
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:13,080
fitness report as part of a conspiracy
to do him in and was even critical of the

141
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:14,580
commandant of the Marine Corps.

142
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,640
I was never told what words passed between
my father and the commandant while he

143
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:23,610
was away from us in Bethesda,
but given his father,

144
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,800
but given father's outspokenness and his
sense of injustice being done to him,

145
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm certain that they
were less than cordial,

146
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,440
general Lemieux Mule Sea Shepherd.

147
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,620
The commandant had also been my
godfather and prior to father's stroke,

148
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:45,050
he regularly sent me birthday presence
after father came back from Bethesda.

149
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,230
I never received another
gift or communication from
my godfather and for years I

150
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:55,080
did not understand if or
why he had abandoned me.

151
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,040
So I'm sure chesty I'm sure Jesse let
let the common dot know what was up and

152
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,030
what he thought about what's going on.

153
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:09,390
So as we know from the first book marine,
the life of chesty puller,

154
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,250
that after he was retired
from the marine corps,

155
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,510
they went to

156
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,050
two chestie's wife's hometown.
Here we go back to the book,

157
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,170
the Sleepy Little Virginia town of Saluda.

158
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,890
Although straddling a major north
south thoroughfare was no more than a

159
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:33,600
crossroads with a dozen or so small
businesses and 50 or 60 houses.

160
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,640
Had it not been my mother's birthplace,
it would've seemed strange.

161
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,480
It would have seemed to same strange
setting for a man famous as my father to

162
00:11:42,481 --> 00:11:44,310
have picked to spend his retirement years.

163
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,910
There was so little industry and so few
business opportunities that most of the

164
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:52,080
young men and women moved away as soon
as they finish school and the inhabitants

165
00:11:52,081 --> 00:11:56,440
who remained were either old or
unenthusiastic about moving on.

166
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,680
Without a support staff,
our lives become,

167
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,390
became much less pampered and for the
first time Martha and I were faced with

168
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,940
household chores prior
to father's retirement.

169
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:11,350
I never made my own bed or shine my own
shoes and now it was expected to help

170
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:12,340
maintain a home.

171
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,170
There were times early on as I struggled
beneath a load of firewood or rake

172
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:22,150
leaves into a pile for burning when
I thought what a downward turn of our

173
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:25,240
fortunes had taken. Gradually, however,

174
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:30,330
I began to take pride in
my responsibilities and as
the house and grounds began

175
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:35,380
responding to our nurturing,
I felt real accomplishment.

176
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,250
We never talked about father's
stroke after we moved to Saluda,

177
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,780
but there was an unstated premise that
he was unable to do any strenuous work

178
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:46,270
around the house and I
tried to step into the void.

179
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,550
I puffed with pride to think that I
was in a sense becoming the man of the

180
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:52,384
house.

181
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,000
So little boys stepping it up.

182
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,743
Now

183
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,470
as as in the first book we talked about
the trial that took place in the end

184
00:13:07,471 --> 00:13:12,471
where the recruits were killed in and
drowned and chesty puller was called to

185
00:13:12,961 --> 00:13:17,940
the witness stand from retirement to
talk about Marine Corps training and this

186
00:13:17,941 --> 00:13:22,770
is when he comes back from
that back to the book.

187
00:13:22,771 --> 00:13:26,250
We met him at the airport in Richmond
when he returned home and I knew by the

188
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:28,890
way, he constantly strode
through the crowd of cameras,

189
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,880
photographers and newsmen on his way
to the car that he was pleased with his

190
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:34,320
performance at Parris Island.

191
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,760
Apparently most Americans agreed for
in the weeks and months that followed,

192
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,350
he received hundreds of phone calls,

193
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:43,980
telegrams and letters praising him for
coming to the defense of the Marine Corps.

194
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:50,210
I realized then that bitter as he was
for the way he saved himself to have been

195
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:53,430
treated by the higher ups in
the Marine Corps headquarters.

196
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,700
He was incapable of sitting idly by
while his beloved core was under attack.

197
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,870
His testimony also reinforced
the perception that he
was a marine's marine who

198
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:08,871
cared far more about the enlisted men
than he did about high ranking officers.

199
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,940
We also hunted together as we had five
years earlier in the hills of Camp

200
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,080
Pendleton. By now having moved up
from a 22 to a 12 gauge shotgun,

201
00:14:22,081 --> 00:14:25,860
I could easily keep up with my father
as we stocked through the woodlands and

202
00:14:25,861 --> 00:14:30,660
open fields around Saluda looking for
rabbits and squirrels in California.

203
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,590
I had been amazed that my father could
walk so fast and so far while I seem to

204
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:39,591
always be out of breath or trying to
ignore the woodiness in my legs now.

205
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:45,150
However, as he neared 60 years of age
and I was moving into adolescence,

206
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:50,510
the roles were reversed and he was the
one who needed frequent stops renew his

207
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:52,190
strength.

208
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,420
He still had a good eye and quick enough
reflex is to be able to bring down a

209
00:14:56,421 --> 00:14:58,070
flushed quail are moving rabbit,

210
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,720
but I was beginning to understand that
when he paused to listen for game or

211
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:03,980
check his bearings,

212
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,570
he was really buying time against his
encroaching against the encroachments of

213
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:09,404
old age.

214
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,150
So that's the way it is.

215
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,980
That's the way of works.

216
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,310
Yeah.

217
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,600
Good manners were an element
in our upbringing that
mother and father considered

218
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:24,231
important.

219
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:28,340
I was taught early to stand when adult
entered adults entered the room and help

220
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:31,940
ladies out with their chairs
or with car doors. We weren't,

221
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,630
we never interrupted grownups and
conversations and when addressing them we

222
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:38,360
always ended our responses
with sir or ma'am.

223
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,170
Father taught me to squeeze a man's hand
firmly when I shook hands and to look

224
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,210
people straight in the
eye when we were talking,

225
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,770
he valued personal appearances and good
grooming and until I left for college,

226
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,290
I never went more than a
few weeks without a haircut.

227
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,910
When I was in seventh grade,

228
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:56,180
he taught me how to tie a neck tie
and from then on I was expected to be

229
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:59,210
properly dressed in a coat
and tie for special occasions.

230
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,910
Okay.

231
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,210
I was equally aware of how I
looked to others. In seventh grade,

232
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:09,211
I was fitted for braces by an orthodontist
in Richmond and on the way home in

233
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,510
the car,
my teeth hurt and I was depressed.

234
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,040
I had gotten eyeglasses only a few months
earlier to correct my near sightedness

235
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,170
and the braces were coming so quickly
after the glasses were more than my

236
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,910
fragile psyche could handle.

237
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,650
Father noticed my despondency and
suggested that we stop on the outskirts of

238
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:33,880
Richmond for cheeseburgers and ice cream.
With my sore teeth,

239
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,020
I could manage neither.

240
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,530
So while mother and father were finishing
their meal and the drug store where we

241
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:42,520
just stopped, I wandered over to the
magazine stand and began browsing.

242
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,700
Before I had gotten two
pages into the magazine,

243
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:49,780
I had selected a burly white collar.
Druggist appeared at my side,

244
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,940
snatched the magazine from my hand,

245
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:55,780
then began brow beating me for reading
the magazine without paying for it.

246
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,750
I was totally bewildered by his attitude,

247
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,360
but before I could retreat or apologize,

248
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,510
I saw it at the corner of my eye that my
father had risen from his booth and was

249
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:10,810
advancing towards the druggist.
His teeth were tightly clenched,

250
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,190
as were his fists,

251
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,400
and there was fire in his eyes
as he came to rest with his face,

252
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:21,430
not six inches from the drug lists.
Before he spoke,

253
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,200
I looked at my mother, who with
her eyes closed in the vinyl booth,

254
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:30,910
appeared to be praying and then I looked
at the druggist who is at least 50

255
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:35,050
pounds heavier in 30 years younger
than my father. Leave the boy alone,

256
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:38,530
my father growled, growled,
and a voice gone hard,

257
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,820
or you and I can go outside
and settle this for a moment.

258
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:46,330
That drug has said nothing has his face
blanched until it was the color of his

259
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:49,470
color.
Excuse sir,

260
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:54,150
he finally stammered and then retreated
to the safety of his cash register.

261
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,390
Okay.

262
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:00,390
Mother had reacted as if she had seen
my father behaves similarly on other

263
00:18:01,391 --> 00:18:02,230
occasions

264
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,930
at Christchurch, so this is where
he went to school at Christ church.

265
00:18:11,931 --> 00:18:15,950
I threw myself into studies
partly to compensate for
not being a capable athlete.

266
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,820
I did well academically and quickly
gained a reputation as one of the bright

267
00:18:19,821 --> 00:18:20,121
boys.

268
00:18:20,121 --> 00:18:25,121
So in the book he talks about how you
know he's just not not a great athlete and

269
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,490
his sister is a better athlete than him
and she kind of, it's his twin sister.

270
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:31,460
She kind of does better and things,
so he focuses on his academics.

271
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,401
As I grew older,

272
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:39,110
I began to sometime the sometimes
painful process by which a son distances

273
00:18:39,111 --> 00:18:42,380
himself from his father and preparation
for striking out on his own.

274
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,490
I began to realize that my father,
the man and my father, the legend,

275
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,170
we're not always one and the same.

276
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,320
The legend was all powerful,

277
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,330
fearless in the face of any challenge or
adversity and incapable of mistakes in

278
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:01,020
judgment or unfairness in
dealings with lesser mortals.

279
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,490
The man,

280
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,810
like most men approaching their twilight
years was not as strong as he had once

281
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:12,490
been. Occasionally showed signs of self
doubt and made his share of errors when

282
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:16,060
interacting with other people
from the time I was a little boy,

283
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,450
he had delighted in balling up his fists
and playing and playfully going several

284
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:25,690
rounds with me. He continued the
game after I started high school,

285
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,030
but by the time I was 15 or 16,

286
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:33,031
my reflexes had become sharper than his
and I became uncomfortable exchanging

287
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,510
mock punches with him.

288
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,013
Okay.

289
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,770
The, the, it's, it's interesting
and I watched a few interviews with,

290
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,380
with uh,
Lou polar junior and he's not,

291
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,710
it might sound my keys,
um,

292
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,870
being disparaging by saying there was the
legend and then there was the real man,

293
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,090
but he, it, he comes clear in the book.
He's not being disparaging at all.

294
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,210
He's, and he definitely, in some of
the interviews I watched with them,

295
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,960
he's explaining like, no,
it's not a negative thing,

296
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:12,190
it's just that everyone fought.
Chesty Puller was this legendary thing,

297
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:17,550
but it was the man that he knew as his
dad and that man was more important in a

298
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:18,940
better human being and all that.

299
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,970
So he's not being disparaging by saying
that there was a difference between the

300
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,670
two. He's just be stating that
there was a difference. Yeah.

301
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:26,730
Okay.

302
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,970
But as you know, as loopholes going
through this rebellious stage,

303
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,820
back to the book,
I also began to be bothered by my fathers,

304
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,950
by the waste of my father's considerable
talent and an inordinate amount of time

305
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:40,290
he spent on trivial undertakings.

306
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,050
Okay.

307
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:46,340
My father spent hours sitting at the
dining room table playing solitaire or

308
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:48,550
rereading books that he
had owned for many years.

309
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,630
Mother was busy running the House
and raising Virginia, Martha and me.

310
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,190
While there were days during which my
father did nothing more than make an

311
00:20:57,191 --> 00:21:00,340
occasional trip to the corner
store fetcher fetch the mail.

312
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480
He was easy to have around the house and
was almost totally undemanding of his

313
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:07,450
children.

314
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,690
But it seemed to me that
this living legend should
have more important things to

315
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:13,960
do than serve as an air board.
Aaron boy. For my mother.

316
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,350
I did not realize that the Marine Corps
had been his whole life and that in

317
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:23,240
committing himself so
totally to its mission,

318
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,620
he had never had the time for
hobbies or other outside interests.

319
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,510
I also did not see until I was much
older that my father's stroke had taken a

320
00:21:32,511 --> 00:21:36,260
physical toll on him that
he would never acknowledge.

321
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,860
In the middle of my junior
year in high school,

322
00:21:40,861 --> 00:21:45,861
my father awaken one night in intense
pain and they took him to Portsmouth Naval

323
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,150
Hospital.
And on the way there,

324
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:52,380
my father held tightly to my hand for
most of the trip and I could tell that he

325
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:53,370
was in agony.

326
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,030
Although the only complaint was that
he was not allowed to smoke in the

327
00:21:57,031 --> 00:21:57,864
ambulance.

328
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,453
Okay.

329
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,670
And when he returned home

330
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,210
a loophole or finally realized
that he wanted to talk,

331
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,130
and so now they're kind of,

332
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,310
they kind of connect here for
perhaps seven or eight days.

333
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:18,390
In that winter of 1962 I was able to
communicate with my father as I never had

334
00:22:18,391 --> 00:22:19,224
before.

335
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,070
He told me that he was fearful about aging
and the inevitable declining state of

336
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:29,100
his health and about how he never
wanted to be a burden to his family.

337
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,660
I listened as best I could to an old
man reveal feelings that he had never

338
00:22:33,661 --> 00:22:34,590
expressed before.

339
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,860
He also told me that he was counting on
me to carry on when he was gone and how

340
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,870
proud he was to have a son
to continue the polar name.

341
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,340
Okay.

342
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,090
We did not talk about the military or my
attempting to follow in his footsteps,

343
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,530
but even then,

344
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:54,210
there was some unstated assumptions
about the course my life would take.

345
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,480
Several years earlier,
shortly after his retirement,

346
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:02,380
we had gone to the William
w gone to Williamsburg for
an outing and he had taken

347
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,710
me to see a short film about the
American Revolution called the story of a

348
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:06,544
Patriot,

349
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,380
which was shown continuously to tourists
visiting the new information center.

350
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,270
At the conclusion of the film,

351
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:16,870
the main character watches a group of
young men who have just enlisted to go

352
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:20,830
fight the British and he swells with pride
when he sees his son among the ranks.

353
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,880
Of the newly enlisted,
my father's enchantment.

354
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:28,000
With that scene registered
powerfully on my young psyche.

355
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,340
And without ever saying another word,

356
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:35,341
I knew that someday I would be
enlisting in some as yet undetermined.

357
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,590
Cause now five or six years later,

358
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,030
I shared the dining table of
our home with the man I loved,

359
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:47,690
like no other in the world.
I wanted desperately to be
what he expected me to be.

360
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,170
It took me years to realize that I could
never hope to emulate the legend that

361
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:55,610
was chesty puller.

362
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:56,920
Okay.

363
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:01,920
But I knew even then that I love
the man far more than the legend.

364
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:04,913
Okay.

365
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:11,270
Oh sorry. Yeah, it's reality. It's life.

366
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,000
And as I mentioned in the
beginning of this whole thing,

367
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,580
this a story about life.

368
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,110
If you carry it through all
stories about life and death,

369
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:24,110
and you can see some
deterioration starting to occur.

370
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,700
Back to the book in the autumn of 1967
with the lengthening shadow of the

371
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,280
Vietnam War,
spreading a chill across America.

372
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:35,870
I moved on from the carefree pursuits
of undergraduate life at the College of

373
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,320
William and Mary and join the
Marine Corps like my father,

374
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:43,850
who had enlisted 50 years earlier
during the war to end all wars.

375
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:47,990
I traveled from Rural Virginia to the
Marine Corps recruiting station in nearby

376
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:51,530
Richmond in search of
something larger than myself.

377
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,740
I had drifted through previous four years
drinking beer and chasing girls with a

378
00:24:56,751 --> 00:25:00,260
singleness of purpose that belied
my lack of meaningful direction.

379
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,490
And now on the threshold of
manhood and with war is a backdrop.

380
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,750
I realized the time had come
to put my frivolity aside.

381
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:12,770
So obviously he goes to college,
he gets done with college,

382
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,350
and he says,
I'm going in the Marine Corps.

383
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,050
William and Mary in the months prior
to my departure was still the sleepy

384
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,040
southern campus who's quaintness
at attracted me four years earlier.

385
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,150
The carnage taking place in Southeast
Asia had remained a distant and

386
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:33,140
nonintrusive reality for all,

387
00:25:33,141 --> 00:25:38,141
but the most perceptive of us insulated
as we were by youth and inexperience.

388
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,850
So even with the Vietnam war going on,

389
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:42,290
like they weren't even
paying attention to it.

390
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,980
Even even even loophole and
wasn't paying attention to it.

391
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,410
Yeah.

392
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,380
There were,
however signs of a more ominous nature.

393
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,270
The networks had begun reporting the
rising casualty tolls on the nightly news.

394
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,580
I viewed the graduation that ended my
student draft deferment and qualified me

395
00:26:00,581 --> 00:26:04,570
for the Marine Corps officer candidate
program as an opportunity rather than a

396
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:07,120
burden.
As I entered the recruiter's office,

397
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,140
I was acutely aware of the impact that
my name would have on the sergeant whose

398
00:26:11,141 --> 00:26:15,670
duty would be to convince me of the
golden opportunities that a hitch in the

399
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,503
Marine Corps could provide.

400
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,620
Okay.

401
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,180
The marine corps builds men.

402
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,280
The decal sat on his office divider and I,
in my youthful exuberance,

403
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:28,650
never pause to consider that
the core might do the opposite.

404
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,460
When he realized who I was,

405
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:34,880
the sergeant dispensed with his usual
sales pitch and concentrated on the

406
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:38,930
mechanics of becoming the recruiter
who signed up chesty puller son,

407
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,351
the recruiter,

408
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:46,350
also telephone to Marine
Corps in Washington DC to
obtain a waiver for my poor

409
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:51,351
eyesight and the authority on the other
end of the line at first demurred but

410
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:54,390
then act. We asked when he realized
that if he stood from the core,

411
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:58,110
would fail to sign up the son of
its most famous marine because of a

412
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,010
technicality.

413
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,960
Okay.

414
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,380
I returned to Saluda to await orders
to Quantico for basic training.

415
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,970
My older sister's husband,
captain build the beat.

416
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,650
Dabney was already serving a tour as
a Marine infantry company commander in

417
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:16,410
Vietnam and she too was back at home,

418
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,520
sitting out our generation's
initial venture into the war.

419
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,860
Okay?

420
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,090
After a childhood diet of Hemingway
novels and John Wayne Movies,

421
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:32,280
along with my father's ex Zamvil,
I viewed my own prospects,

422
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,730
if not with eagerness,
at least with equanimity.

423
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,760
Okay?

424
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,660
The comradery of the fraternity.

425
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,500
It talks about how he's in a fraternity
and whatnot. One of these at college,

426
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,210
the Camaraderie of the fraternity now
seemed almost trivial and although I often

427
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,280
drink myself to the point of oblivion,

428
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,860
I could not escape the
feeling that for me,

429
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,700
the carefree celebrations of
youth could not be recaptured.

430
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,860
Of all my acquaintances,
acquaintances at William and Mary,

431
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:04,030
the only one had been touched by war
for which I was headed. Brian Speer,

432
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:05,950
the president of a neighboring fraternity,

433
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:09,820
whose dreams of manhood
I have been privileged to
share and frequent late night

434
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,880
bull sessions had preceded
me into the marine corps

435
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,550
and had been killed within months of his
arrival in Vietnam. The previous June.

436
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,780
His death saddened me and brought home
the intimations of mortality with which

437
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,770
most of my circle were
blessedly unfamiliar

438
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,553
during this.

439
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,380
You Remember Charlie Paul talking about
when they are at the naval academy and

440
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:41,270
they weren't even talking about
Vietnam. It's crazy, isn't it? Yeah.

441
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,320
Very similar,
but it must've been,

442
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,750
I guess they didn't have the 24 hour
news cycles you have now in the Internet

443
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:54,770
and the stories and the click bait and
all that stuff going on and those things

444
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:59,090
can be a little bit more isolated. Yeah,
like you got to choose to follow it. Yeah.

445
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,340
Yeah.
You've got to help the story a little bit.

446
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:04,730
During this waiting time,

447
00:29:04,731 --> 00:29:08,600
my father had remained characteristically
closed mouth about my future in the

448
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,670
Marine Corps. I, of course,

449
00:29:10,671 --> 00:29:13,970
knew that he was immensely proud of me
for having chosen to follow his example,

450
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,650
but a tacit understanding between
us made words unnecessary.

451
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,180
I felt an urgent and compelling need to
prove myself worthy of his name and key

452
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,900
in the twilight of his military
career that spanned almost 40 years,

453
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,270
wished that he could go in my stead.

454
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:30,810
Okay.

455
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,630
As I said my goodbyes and
prepared to leave for Quantico,

456
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,810
he kissed me squarely on the lips and
held be tightly and his arms are reported.

457
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:43,000
Officer candidate school is late
in the day as was acceptable.

458
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,110
I overheard two large sergeants
conversing animatedly about who among this

459
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:53,140
miserable collection of pukes could
possibly be chesty puller son.

460
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,650
And I wondering if I had taken
on more than I could handle.

461
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,890
So they got a.
