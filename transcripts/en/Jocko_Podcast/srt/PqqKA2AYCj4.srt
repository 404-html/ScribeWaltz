Jocko,
dear Jocko,

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,380
my chosen community has lost and
continues to lose members due to suicide.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,650
One reason is that they
don't ask for help.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,290
I think one reason they don't ask for
help is that they're afraid of being or

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,180
being seen as weak.

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,560
I'm aware that this takes strength
and discipline to be able to perceive,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,620
perceive when you need
help and to ask for it.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,840
I don't know how to convey that to them.

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,760
Could you address how one
can gather support from their
team without losing face?

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,550
So there's an obvious reason why
I paired these two questions.
