00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,590
This is Jocko podcast number
one 56 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,740
Jocko Willink. Good evening, good evening

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,530
resistance.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:16,210
Why didn't you resist today?

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,540
Those who have continued to live on
and comfort scold those who suffered,

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,713
yes,

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:27,870
resistance should have begun right there
at the moment of the arrest itself,

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,060
but it did not begin
during a daylight arrest.

9
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,710
There was always that brief and unique
moment when they are leading you either

10
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:43,390
inconspicuously on the basis of a
cowardly deal you have made or else quite

11
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:48,391
openly their pistols on holstered
through a crowd of hundreds of just such

12
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:51,790
doomed innocence as yourself.
You weren't gagged.

13
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,920
Okay?

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,450
You really can and you really
ought to cry out to cry out.

15
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,340
You were being arrested.
That villains in disguise are trapping.

16
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:06,870
People that are rest are being made on
the strength of false denunciations,

17
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,380
that millions are being
subjected to silent reprisals.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,360
If many such outcries had been heard all
over the city and the course of a day

19
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,350
would not. Our fellow citizens
perhaps have begun to bristle

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,850
and would a rat in a wood arrests
perhaps no longer have been so easy.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,960
Instead,
not one sound comes from Europe,

22
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,170
parched lips and that passing crowd
naively believes that you and your

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,910
executioners our friends out for a stroll.

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,190
I myself often had the chance to cry out.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,913
Okay,

26
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,040
so why did I keep silent?

27
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,920
Why in my last minute out in the open
did I not attempt to enlighten the

28
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:03,330
hoodwinked crowd?

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,290
Why did I keep silent?

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Every man always has a dozen glib
little reasons why he is right not to

31
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,090
sacrifice himself.

32
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Some still have hopes of a favorable
outcome to their case and are afraid to

33
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,030
ruin their chances by outcry.

34
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,250
So they keep silent

35
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,340
and that right there is part
of the opening of book one
part one of the book the

36
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,010
Gulag Archipelago by [inaudible] and I
discussed it on the last podcast with

37
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:54,280
Jordan Peterson, but I didn't dig into
the actual text very much because,

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,450
well I had Jordan Peterson on here and I
rather just talk with him and allow him

39
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,890
to talk rather than read and
delve into the text itself.

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,700
But the text is really good and I wanted
to take today to go through at least,

41
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,470
well to go through today part one of the
Gulag archipelago and the version that

42
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm going through is not the abridged
version but the full unabridged version.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,790
So if you end up looking for some of these
passages in the abridged version that

44
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,890
you might not find them.

45
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,370
And I'm only going to go through part
one today and maybe over time we'll go

46
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:41,011
through all seven parts that
are in three different volumes.

47
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,890
Uh, massive volumes. By the
way, this one is 600 pages long,

48
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,050
um, part to volume two. It looks
like about another 600 pages.

49
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:56,590
And then volume three looks to be, I
don't know, maybe four or 500 pages.

50
00:03:56,591 --> 00:04:01,570
So I think we're talking
maybe 1500 to 2000 pages,

51
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,640
but it's a, it's a great read and
it, like I said, in the future,

52
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,890
if you get these will go will, I
will, I'll say this in the future.

53
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,600
Yes, we will go through all the books. If
you want to get them now and read them,

54
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,910
then eventually you'll be able
to roll through them with us.

55
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,250
And it's, as I said,

56
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,040
I mean this, this, this book
is a very powerful book,

57
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,780
but I said this one when
I was talking to Jordan,

58
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,830
it's written and you could hear
from even the opening there. It's,

59
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,350
it's almost a conversation.

60
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,790
It's a very conversational writing
that social needs and does.

61
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,470
And so it's,
it's pretty easy to read because it's not,

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,590
it's just very compensates.

63
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:48,640
Sounds like somebody telling you a
story is basically what it's like.

64
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:53,050
He's asking you questions, rhetorical
questions, he's interacting with you,

65
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:55,180
the reader.
So it's a pretty fun read.

66
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,990
It's not fun in the fact that you're
reading about people being trapped,

67
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:02,590
tortured, murdered in a
gulag. But he does it in a,

68
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,530
in a lighthearted way. If that's
possible. Is that possible?

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,500
I don't know if it's possible, but
he seems to pull it off. I mean,

70
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:12,580
you can even see just, just what I just
read. Um, you know, you can see he's,

71
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,450
he's having a conversation
with you about it. You know,

72
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,970
he's having a conversation.
So that's what it's like.

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,630
Let's go back to the book and I'm gonna
pick up in a section where he's kind of

74
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:27,160
explaining, and I, and I talked about
this with Jordan and by the way, yeah,

75
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:31,060
so if you haven't listened to one 55 with
Jordan Peterson where we discuss some

76
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:33,550
of this, some of the ideas
in this book, we don't,

77
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,940
we don't delve into the book too much
in a magazine to cover those parts.

78
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,730
There's two little sections that we
covered on a cover again today and kind of

79
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,530
going a little bit more,
but

80
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,230
if you haven't listened to one 55 listen
to one 55 and then then come back and

81
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,430
listen to this.
This one,

82
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,030
this section of the book social knits
and is talking about the fact that he's a

83
00:05:56,321 --> 00:06:01,321
war hero for all practical purposes and
he's about to get rolled up and arrested

84
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,520
by his brigade commander and he,

85
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:09,521
he's talking about his brigade commander
and the situation that he's now going

86
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:15,011
into 10 days before I had led my own
recognizance battery almost intact out of

87
00:06:16,101 --> 00:06:21,101
the fire pocket in which the 12 heavy
guns of his artillery battalion battalion

88
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:26,120
had been left and now he had to renounce
me because of a piece of paper with a

89
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,954
seal on it.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,580
I knew instantly I had been arrested
because of my correspondence with a school

91
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:36,581
friend and understood from what
direction to expect danger.

92
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,940
So He's been, if our pocket, if
you don't know what that means,

93
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:45,020
it means he was surrounded by the enemy
and he was able to lead his troops out

94
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:47,360
of there almost intact,
which means they took some casualties,

95
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:50,180
maybe lost some guys, but he was
able to lead his men out of there.

96
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,730
And yet he wrote a letter and he
mentioned earlier like what he says in the

97
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,900
letter basically says that the leadership
that Stalin's making some mistakes and

98
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,880
guess what?
They screen those letters.

99
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,130
They read what he wrote
and they arrest him.

100
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,130
So
war is hell.

101
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,500
And he talks a little bit about that here.

102
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:18,910
For three weeks the war had been going
on inside Germany and all of us knew very

103
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:23,890
well that if the girls were German,
they could be raped and then shot.

104
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:27,190
This was almost a combat distinction.

105
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,960
Had they been Polish girls or
our own displaced Russian girls,

106
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,130
they could have been chased naked around
the garden and slapped on the behind an

107
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:38,200
amusement no more.

108
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,250
Okay.

109
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,090
By the way, that's just
a little, a little, uh,

110
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,120
of what that war between the Russians
and the Germans was the Russians and the

111
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:56,440
Germans. We talked about
installing Greg, but yeah,

112
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,830
and we talked a little bit about
what happened with civilians.

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,730
There's a little taste of what happens
to civilians in those situations.

114
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,553
It's a nightmare

115
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,390
going on the history,
this is a chapter two,

116
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:14,391
the history of our sewage disposal
system and this is where he expands and

117
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,600
explains sort of his view of the
prisons as a whole back to the book.

118
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:26,640
And it's well known that any Oregon
withers a way if it is not used.

119
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,773
Therefore,

120
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,900
if we know that the Soviet security
Oregon or organs and they christened

121
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:38,391
themselves with this vial word praise
and exalted above all living things have

122
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:41,640
not died off even to the
extent of one single tentacle,

123
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,060
but instead have grown new ones
and strengthen their muscles.

124
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,250
It is easy to do so that they
have had constant exercise

125
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,270
through the sewer pipes,
the flow pulsed,

126
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,010
sometimes the pressure was higher than x,
then had been projected,

127
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,060
sometimes lower,
but the prison sewers were never empty.

128
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,110
The blood,

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,340
the sweat and the urine
into which we were taped,

130
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,120
POLST through them continuously

131
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,760
and he uses this, this
term, which I guess the,

132
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:22,761
the Soviets actually called the prison
system organs and how the blood of the

133
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,000
organs was these people.

134
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,810
And this is something that I talked a
little bit about with Jordan back to the

135
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:38,421
book and even though Len and at the end
of 1917 in order to establish strictly

136
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,650
revolutionary order,

137
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:45,630
demanded merciless suppression of attempts
at anarchy on the part of drunkards,

138
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,510
cool against counter-revolutionaries
and other persons.

139
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,230
So that's how it starts off. It starts
off with that. We're going after,

140
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,000
these are the people that
need to be rounded up.

141
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,590
The people that need to be rounded
up are drunkards, hooligans,

142
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,100
counter-revolutionaries in other persons.
That's where it starts.

143
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,730
And then it continues and it goes on.
And he writes an essay.

144
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:05,600
Leaden writes an essay
called how to organize,

145
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,040
how to organize the competition.

146
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,230
And he proclaimed this again,
this is Len pro crank proclaimed common,

147
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,560
the common United purpose of purging the
Russian land of all kinds of harmful in

148
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,620
sex and the term insects.

149
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,670
And under the term insects,
he included not only all class enemies,

150
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,170
but also workers malingering
at their work. For example,

151
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,880
the type setters of the Petrograd
party printing shops. So you can see,

152
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,930
you can see this is starting to expand
already. Mm. It starts off just, hey,

153
00:10:43,931 --> 00:10:46,090
it's hooligans and drunkards
and counter-revolutionaries.

154
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,510
Now all of a sudden it's getting
towards workers that are being lazy.

155
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,930
You're being a little bit lazy. Guess
what? You need to be unity, be, uh,

156
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,400
arrested and you're one of these insects.
And then this is how this grows in.

157
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,430
And he goes through this massive list
of the people that need to be come

158
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:05,850
insects.
And he describes them as in sex.

159
00:11:05,851 --> 00:11:10,851
So this included local self governing
bodies in the provinces they were in sex.

160
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,210
And people in the cooperative movements,
they were in sex as we're,

161
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,780
anyone that owned their
own home was an insect.

162
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,470
Okay.

163
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,470
There were not a few insects among the
teachers in the gymnasiums and the church

164
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:30,860
parish councils were made up
almost exclusively of insects.

165
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,890
All priests were insects
and all those Tolstoy.

166
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:40,891
Ian's who when they undertook to serve
the Soviet government for example on the

167
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:46,190
railroads refuse to sign the required
oath to defend the Soviet government with

168
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:49,580
gun in hand, thereby showed
themselves to be insects too.

169
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,210
The railroads were
particularly important for,

170
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:59,950
there were indeed many insects hidden
beneath the railroad and telegraph.

171
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:01,360
Hers they were in sex

172
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,310
and he just goes on and on.

173
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:07,960
Um,

174
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,960
all Russian executive committee of the
Union of railroad workers and other trade

175
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:19,951
unions were also often filled with
insects hostile to the working class.

176
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,510
So this paragraph just goes on and on and
basically what it, what it ends up as,

177
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,940
everyone's an insect.
That's how it ends up.

178
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,013
Hmm.

179
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,720
Everyone's an insect and therefore
everyone must be arrested eventually. Hmm.

180
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,673
Okay.

181
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,400
Here's, here's another
expansion here. The,

182
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:45,620
this is the a decree from the Council
of peoples come commit commissar ours

183
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,360
signed by lending on July 22nd,

184
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,620
1918 those guilty of selling or buying
up or keeping for sale in the way of

185
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:56,730
business food products which had been
placed under the monopoly of the republic,

186
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,350
they deserve imprisonment for a term of
not less than 10 years combined with the

187
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:10,501
most for severe forced labor and
confiscation of all their property.

188
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,010
So if you operate on any kind
of black market whatsoever,

189
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,260
10 years confiscation of everything you
own, that's where we're at right now.

190
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,180
1921 begin with the checkout order number
10 dated January 8th to intensified

191
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:37,470
the repression of the Bruges Waze.
Now when the civil war had ended,

192
00:13:37,471 --> 00:13:41,040
repression was not to be
reduced but intensified.

193
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,100
So the civil war's over, the revolution
is over and you think, okay, the is over.

194
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:51,300
We can back off a little bit. No,
no. Now we're going to go harder.

195
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,360
In that same year,
the practice of arresting students began.

196
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,630
The arrests of members of all non
Bolshevik parties were expanded and

197
00:14:02,671 --> 00:14:03,660
systematized,

198
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,970
not one citizen of the former Russian
state who would ever joined a party other

199
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:13,950
than the Bolshevik party could
avoid his fate. Men of religion,

200
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,040
we're an inevitable part of every annual
catch and their silver locks gleaned in

201
00:14:20,431 --> 00:14:25,431
every sale and in every prisoner transport
en route to the soviets t islands.

202
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,190
And those are prisons.

203
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,510
Monks and nuns who's black habits had
been a distinctive feature of old Russian

204
00:14:36,301 --> 00:14:37,134
life.

205
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,500
We're intensively rounded up on every
hand placed under arrest and sent into

206
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:44,304
exile.

207
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,990
As Tanya Covich wrote,
you can pray,

208
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:56,030
you can pray freely,
but just so god alone can here.

209
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,240
So you're allowed to pray.
But only God can hear it.

210
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,550
Meaning don't let anyone else here.
And by the way,

211
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,100
because she wrote that she got
a 10 year sentence for that,

212
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,400
all persons convicted of religious
activity received tenors,

213
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,530
which is the 10 year sentence.

214
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,440
So you can see how this just
gets completely out of control.

215
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,130
And one thing about this book is it's,

216
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,100
it's not really chronological.

217
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,390
So it goes through hole
like this first chapters.

218
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:37,420
It goes through from like the revolution
all the way through after the war so

219
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,770
and then you and then you go through,
it's not chronological,

220
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,650
it just kind of jumps around
a little bit so you have to,

221
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,220
you kind of have to just pay attention
the whole time to what time frame he's

222
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:52,460
talking about. Luckily it gives a lot
of dates on when things are happening.

223
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,930
For instance here back to the book,

224
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:58,460
this therapy continued full speed from
1927 on and immediately exposed to the

225
00:15:58,461 --> 00:16:02,480
proletariat all the causes of our
economic failures and Sorta just, okay,

226
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,310
let's pay attention to this.

227
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,410
All the causes of our economic
failures and it's shortages,

228
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,740
so obviously Russia is going through
all kinds of problems at this time and

229
00:16:12,741 --> 00:16:13,640
here's what caused them.

230
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,080
There was wrecking and wrecking is
their term for basically a saboteur.

231
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,420
Someone that's causing
the problems is a record.

232
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,860
There was wrecking in the people's
Commissariat of railways roads.

233
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,130
That was why it was hard to get
aboard the train and why there were

234
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:31,040
interruptions and supplies.
There were,

235
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,840
there was wrecking in the Moscow electric
power system and interruptions in

236
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:40,130
power. There was wrecking in the oil
industry, hence the shortage of kerosene.

237
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,590
Kerosene.
There was wreckage and textile,

238
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,190
hence nothing for a working
man to wear where the,

239
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,680
in the coal industry there
was colossal wrecking,

240
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,850
hence no heat in the metal,
a jury in a metal, a jury,

241
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,780
defense machinery,
shipbuilding chemical mining,

242
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,270
gold and platinum
industries in irrigation.

243
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:04,390
Everywhere there were these pos filled
boils of wrecking enemies with slide

244
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:07,130
rules were on all sides.

245
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,520
So there they have problems in the
country and it's the what the party is

246
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:16,430
saying, hey this is because
we've got these, these wreckers,

247
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,390
the saboteurs everywhere,
enemies with slide rules,

248
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,530
the GPU puffed and panted in its
efforts to grab off and drag off all the

249
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:32,120
wreckers in the capitals and
in the providence provinces,

250
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,240
the Gpu collegiums and the
proletarian courts kept hard at work,

251
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,720
sifting through the viscous sewage and
every day the workers gasp to learn and

252
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:49,100
sometimes they didn't learn from
the papers of new vial deeds.

253
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,600
So he had the, the, the, the state press,
putting out all this is what's happening.

254
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,150
These are the wreckers.
Every industry,

255
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,240
every factory and every handicraft artele
had to find wreckers in its ranks and

256
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,600
no sooner had they begun to
look than they found them,

257
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,880
continues on when not long afterward,

258
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,910
the new peoples commissar of the railroads
ordered that average loads should be

259
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,870
increased and even
doubled and then tripled.

260
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:28,290
And for this discovery received order
of Lennon along with other others of our

261
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:29,584
leaders,

262
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,130
the malicious engineers who protested
became known as known as limiters.

263
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:40,180
They raised the outcry that this was too
much and would result in the breakdowns

264
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:45,160
of the rolling stock and they were
rightly shocked for their lack of faith in

265
00:18:45,161 --> 00:18:46,870
the possibilities of socialist transport.

266
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,990
So that right there sums up a lot because
you're in this situation and there's

267
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,570
some buddy at the top that saying,
oh,

268
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,410
we need to transport more stuff on the
railroads. Cool. Just load them up more.

269
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,420
And he actual engineers are saying
they can't handle that much weight.

270
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,450
Hey, they can't handle that much
weight. It's going to ruin the trains.

271
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:13,690
It's going to break the trains.
And what do they do? Shoot him,

272
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,030
shoot him in the back, shoot him
in the back of the head because,

273
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:22,120
and they called him limiters. They
gave him a name. You're a limiter.

274
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,050
You just don't want to make this happen.
That's your problem.

275
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,730
And there's a,
there's a

276
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,500
great passage that I read in a book that
I'm going to read right now and this

277
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:42,370
book that I'm gonna pull up real
quick passage from a book called basic

278
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,500
economics written by

279
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,280
a famous very famous
economist I should say,

280
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,480
named Thomas Soule.

281
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,890
And he's just talking about,

282
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,990
he's talking about how they tried to
regulate prices in the Soviet Union.

283
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,100
And there was a way to set the
prices on everything. And he's,

284
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,840
and it says this, so this is
from, this is the role of prices,

285
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:15,760
is the name of the chapter and basic
economics by Thomas Sal. The significant,

286
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,380
the significance of free market prices
and the allocation of resources can be

287
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:24,850
seen more clearly by looking at
situations where prices are not allowed to

288
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:29,851
perform this function during the era of
the government directed economy of the

289
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,500
Soviet Union. For example, prices.
We're not set by supply and demand,

290
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:40,650
but by central planners who sent
resources to their various uses by direct

291
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:42,604
commands,

292
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,730
supplemented by prices that the planners
raised or lowered as they saw fit.

293
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,580
And now he goes into this part where he
takes these two Soviet economists and

294
00:20:56,161 --> 00:21:00,300
they described a situation in which
their government raise the price.

295
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:05,280
It would pay for mole skins,
leading hunters to sell more of them.

296
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,780
And here's that description and this is
these two Soviet economists smell Evan

297
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:14,781
pop off who described the situation
where the government raised the price,

298
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:17,460
it pay for mole skins.
Here we go,

299
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:22,461
state purchases increased and now all
the distribution centers are filled with

300
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:24,900
these pelts.

301
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,670
Industry is unable to use them all and
they often rot in warehouses before they

302
00:21:30,721 --> 00:21:35,310
can be processed. The Ministry of
Light Industry has already requested.

303
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,570
Go, Scott, come in.

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,260
The Ministry of Light Industry has already
requested twice to lower purchasing

305
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:47,010
prices,
but the question has not been decided yet.

306
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,290
And this is not surprising,
it's members are too busy to decide.

307
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,480
They have no time besides setting
the prices on these pelts.

308
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,870
They have to keep track of
another 24 million prices.

309
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,950
So that's what happens. And that's what's
going on. You've got somebody trying to,

310
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:14,070
essentially it's the opposite
of decentralized command.
Mm hmm. So you've got,

311
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,550
you've got people trying
to figure out what a,

312
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,660
to what this mole skin pelt should cost.
And what happens is when they,

313
00:22:21,661 --> 00:22:23,250
when the government raises the price,
they'll pay for it.

314
00:22:23,251 --> 00:22:24,480
What do all the people do?

315
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,840
They go and gather more of these pelts
and now there's an overstock of them.

316
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:30,580
And they try and get them to lower the
prices. So people weren't stopping.

317
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,321
We'll stop,
turn them in,

318
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:35,220
but they can't do it quick enough because
I've got 24 million other prices that

319
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,890
they got a set for the government.

320
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:43,650
So that in a nutshell is why all these
problems are one of the major reasons why

321
00:22:43,651 --> 00:22:47,550
all these problems are occurring.
And whenever somebody tries to, um,

322
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,770
resist what commands are being given,
they're getting shot. Limiters.

323
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,210
Yeah. And this is one I talked about
a little bit with Jordan in September,

324
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,680
1930 the famine organizers were
tried with a great hue and cry.

325
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,990
They were the ones,
there they are.

326
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,480
Okay.

327
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,330
There were 48 records in the food industry

328
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,550
stolen,

329
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,290
carried out the first such effort in
connection with the trial of the famine

330
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,400
organizers.

331
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,020
And how could it not succeed when
everyone was starving in boldness Russia?

332
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,090
And everyone was always
looking about and asking,

333
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:27,420
where did all our dear Brett get to?
Therefore,

334
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:30,750
before the cur court verdict,
the workers and employees raffles,

335
00:23:30,751 --> 00:23:33,780
he voted for the death penalty
for the scoundrels on trial.

336
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:40,070
It was the newspaper March of millions
and the roar rose outside the windows of

337
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:46,100
the courtroom. Death, death, death.

338
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,280
So for these types of reasons for
this centralized command doesn't work.

339
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,110
Not to mention we,
you know what they did,

340
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:57,110
took the farms away from the people
that actually knew how to farm there.

341
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,660
There's complete famine and they're blue.

342
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,720
They're blaming it on the 48 people
that were saboteurs inside the,

343
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:09,020
uh,
the agriculture industry.

344
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,740
Completely insane.

345
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,020
And this one I read with Jordan on a,
read it again in the Russian, in Russian,

346
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,790
a Kulak is a myth,
a miserly,

347
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:23,730
dishonest rural trader who
grows rich not by his own labor,

348
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,140
but through someone else's,

349
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:30,410
through your surgery and operating as
a middleman in every locality be even

350
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,370
before the revolution.

351
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,380
Such cool acts could be numbered on
one's fingers and the revolution totally

352
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:40,320
destroyed their basis of activity.
Subsequently,

353
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,110
after 1917 by a transfer of meaning,

354
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,380
the name Kulak began to be applied to
all those who in any way hired workers,

355
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:54,270
even if it was only when
they were temporarily short
of working hands in their

356
00:24:54,271 --> 00:24:55,620
own families.

357
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:01,070
So a Kulak started off as someone
that was trying to rip people off,

358
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,770
but then they just started
applying it to everyone.

359
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:09,180
Anyone that hired someone was a Kulak
and it has a derogatory tone to it.

360
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,443
Okay,

361
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,500
continuing on,

362
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,270
but the inflation of this scathing term
Kulak proceeded relentlessly and by 1930

363
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:21,920
all strong peasants in general,
we're being, we're being so cold,

364
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,960
all peasant strong and management,

365
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:26,690
strong and work or even
strong merely in convictions.

366
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,430
The term Kulak was used to smash
the strength of the peasantry.

367
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,530
Beyond this.
In every village,

368
00:25:35,531 --> 00:25:39,490
there were people who in
one way or another had
personally gotten in the way of

369
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:40,780
the local activists.

370
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,130
This was the perfect time to settle
accounts with them of jealousy, envy,

371
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:45,964
an insult,

372
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,920
a new word was needed for all those
victims as a class and it was born by this

373
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:54,370
time. It had no social or
economic content whatsoever,

374
00:25:54,371 --> 00:25:57,670
but had a marvelous sound pot,
Kulak neck,

375
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,650
a person aiding the cool acts. In
other words, I consider you a comp,

376
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,340
an accomplice of the enemy.
Now,

377
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,580
what's interesting about this, and I had,
I had a bunch of people point this out,

378
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,090
this, this is when we take
words, powerful words,

379
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,950
and we start to throw them at people
and we use them universally, that's,

380
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,570
that's going to cause a problem.

381
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:25,410
And you can see it all the time
right now in social media and in the,

382
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:25,991
yeah,

383
00:26:25,991 --> 00:26:29,950
I guess you see it primarily in social
media from like far left extremists and

384
00:26:29,951 --> 00:26:32,320
far right extremists to the far right.

385
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,380
Anybody that's to the left to them
is like a communist to the far left.

386
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:43,000
Anybody that's to the right of them
is a racist or a Nazi and they,

387
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,670
those words around and those words
that you shouldn't use those words.

388
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,520
It's like using Kulak like that.

389
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,430
That's not the person that hires someone
isn't a Kulak. Yeah, right. Yeah.

390
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,730
I like that doesn't work.

391
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:00,330
So we escalate these terms and that's,

392
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,560
that's not a healthy thing to
do. I mean, I think it was, um,

393
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,320
when, yeah, I mean,

394
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,030
when Jordan Peterson gets
compared to Adolf Hitler. Yeah,

395
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,400
right. They come here, Jordan
Peterson to Adolf Hitler.

396
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,693
Okay.

397
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:21,350
Come on. Yeah. Okay. You don't like
some of Jordan Peterson's ideas. Yeah.

398
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,410
Okay. That's cool. Don't
call them Adolf Hitler. Yeah.

399
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:30,770
Like that's just not realistic.
Yeah.

400
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,360
It's not helpful to, you know, or
people don't like his ideas or whatever,

401
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:37,340
like for a specific reason,
you know,

402
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,980
rather than identify
the reason they dislike,

403
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,150
package them up and put an ugly
bow tie on it and be like, yeah,

404
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,310
I hate you.
You kind of thing

405
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:51,180
in the right. You know, if you
think about during McCarthyism,

406
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,630
right, it was, hey, anti America, you're
anti American, you're a communist.

407
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,240
It was like they were
flagging people like that.

408
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,280
So both sides can do this. In
this case, it's, in this case,

409
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:07,090
it's the [inaudible]. It's the
communists be escalating these terms.

410
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,100
We've seen the right do it. We see the
left do it. Not a smart thing to do.

411
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:16,930
Don't throw those terms out
where they don't belong. Yeah.

412
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,460
Talk to him about this a little bit with
Jordan and there was a wave and then we

413
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:25,091
talked about wave.

414
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:28,750
You talking about waves of people that
would flow into the prisons and there's

415
00:28:28,751 --> 00:28:29,501
all these different ways.

416
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,960
You're talking about dozens
and dozens of different waves.

417
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,840
There was a wave for snipping ears,

418
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,040
the nighttime snipping of individual
ears of grain in the field,

419
00:28:39,041 --> 00:28:43,540
a totally new type of agriculture
activity, a new type of harvesting.

420
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,600
The wave of those caught
doing this was not small.

421
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,760
It included many tens of thousands of
peasants. Many of them, not even adults,

422
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,601
but boys,

423
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:57,010
girls and small children whose elders had
sent them out at night to snip because

424
00:28:57,011 --> 00:29:00,700
they had no hope of receiving anything
from the collective farm for their

425
00:29:00,701 --> 00:29:01,534
daytime Labor,

426
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:06,660
Labor for this bitter and not
very productive occupation
and extreme of poverty

427
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:11,350
to which the peasants had not been driven.
Even in serfdom,

428
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,480
the court's handed out a full measure,

429
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,910
10 years for what ranked as an especially
dangerous theft of socialists property.

430
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:22,720
Again, that again, that's why I say
this book is kind of light to read,

431
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,170
write and he's, he's,
he's kind of funny, right?

432
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,990
Especially dangerous staffed
of Socialists properties.

433
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:32,500
Talking about taking a
one year of of grain.

434
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,460
Is he saying that like on his own
kind of thing or is, is that what,

435
00:29:37,461 --> 00:29:40,850
what the people say? That's
you. That's what the,

436
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,490
like you stole communist

437
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,290
Socialist property,

438
00:29:44,291 --> 00:29:49,291
you stole it and you must be destroyed
10 years cause you took a little piece of

439
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:54,310
grain. Yes. Like these, like if you get a,

440
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,420
I dunno Jay walking ticket or something,
hey you committed a crime here, criminal,

441
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,790
you know, kind of thing. Yeah.

442
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:02,670
You can just call someone a
criminal usually has them,

443
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,700
even though technically you know,
they're not kinda wrong, you know?

444
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,390
Yeah. I got rolled up in Vegas.
Yeah. I got rolled up in Vegas.

445
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,860
I was with sarge.
Sure.

446
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,220
We were crossing one of the big streets
in Vegas and I had to grab something or

447
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,140
I dropped something or I was tying
my shoe or doing something and the,

448
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,330
the walking light went red.

449
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,410
But the cars weren't going yet and
sarge had already walked across.

450
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,320
So I just kind of jogged cross,
you know,

451
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:37,321
before any car started
moving squad car lights.

452
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,100
Then 10 seconds later,
four squad cars.

453
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,360
I don't know if they thought I was
somebody else. So I'm there, you know, on,

454
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,420
on the curb. Facedown. Facedown.

455
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,180
Sarge is videoing it.
Laughing at me.

456
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:00,380
Yes I was a criminal and still eat.
But what then did what they do?

457
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,890
You did you get dressed, you
know, they gave me a ticket.

458
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:07,570
They gave me a ticket for jaywalking.
Yeah, well I guess criminal rate.

459
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:09,880
What's a criminal? And they probably
thought, they probably thought, oh,

460
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,150
we're going to roll up this
drunk idiot guy. I'm totally,

461
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:15,730
so it was up there for the UFC, you
know, I was up there with a fighter.

462
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:17,920
I don't know, we were probably
going to, uh, you know,

463
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:21,640
cut weight or something with a fighter
and there I am getting rolled up,

464
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,380
rolled down the road.
There's no cars, cars.

465
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:29,110
They must've thought I was somebody else
who has to be thought a big, you know,

466
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:33,120
and it's like, Hey, this guy looks like
he could get in trouble or something.

467
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:37,600
And Jay walking, obviously a car, but the,

468
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,990
I guess when you think about a criminal,
right? Criminal, what's, what's,

469
00:31:40,991 --> 00:31:44,410
what does that, is that like someone
who commits? Imagine it. In this case,

470
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:45,490
what they'd say is,
Oh,

471
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:49,980
you were blocking the transportation
of socialist property, therefore you,

472
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:52,770
that's a crime against the state you
get in 10 years. That's the same.

473
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,110
That's exactly what we're talking about,
has exactly what we're talking about.

474
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,350
Western jaywalking get 10 years for going
out and clipping a single grain of a

475
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,630
single year of corn or grain,

476
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:10,390
getting 10 years for that and you're 12
years old or whatever crime against the

477
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:14,560
state. It's like when people throw
around the word treason, you know?

478
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:18,070
You know how like when when people
get into political debates around oil,

479
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,170
that's treason. That's
the, that's your right.

480
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,870
There's people throw that word around
when it shouldn't be thrown around.

481
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:27,700
Be careful when you, when
you commit treason, that's
definitely a big deal, man.

482
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,890
So people say, uh Oh, what?
What's a good example of fats?

483
00:32:32,891 --> 00:32:35,440
Treason.
Treason is a big deal.

484
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:38,530
You shouldn't throw that word around
unless you're thinking somebody needs the

485
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,070
death penalty. Yeah. So yeah,

486
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,000
it's a good example.

487
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,370
Check back to the book.
Paradoxically enough,

488
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,580
every act of the all penetrating eternally
wakeful organs over a span of many

489
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,890
years was based solely on one article of
the hundred and 40 articles of the Non

490
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,020
General Division of the Criminal Criminal
Code of 1926 so this is where all this

491
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,100
crap came from.

492
00:33:04,101 --> 00:33:09,101
They wrote this criminal code of
1926 and the including the great,

493
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:10,370
powerful,
abundant,

494
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:15,371
highly ramified multi-form wide sweeping
article 58 which summed up the world

495
00:33:17,481 --> 00:33:22,481
not so much through the exact terms
of its sections as in their extended

496
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,780
dialectical interpretation.
In all truth,

497
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:31,820
there is no step fought action or
lack of action under the heavens,

498
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:36,940
which could not be punished by the heavy
hand of article 58 the article itself

499
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,430
could not be worded in such broad terms,

500
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,580
but it proved possible to
interpret it this broadly.

501
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,620
Article 58 was not in that division
of the code dealing with the political

502
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,160
crimes and nowhere was it
categorized as political? No,

503
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,140
it was included with crimes against public
order and organized gangsterism in a

504
00:33:57,141 --> 00:34:00,740
division of crimes against the state.

505
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,080
And then he goes through all these various
sections of article 58 which had 14

506
00:34:06,081 --> 00:34:10,640
sections
in section one we learned that any action,

507
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,610
and according to article
six of the Criminal Code,

508
00:34:13,611 --> 00:34:17,000
any absence of action directed toward
the weakening of state power was

509
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,850
considered to be counterrevolutionary
broadly interpreted.

510
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:24,430
This turned out to include the refusal
of a prisoner in camp to work when the

511
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,380
state went in a state of
starvation and exhaustion.

512
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:32,450
That was a weakening of state power
and it was punished by execution

513
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,830
because if you're in
prison and you're starving,

514
00:34:36,831 --> 00:34:38,480
but you're not doing the
work you're supposed to do,

515
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:41,060
you're doing something that's hurting
the state. So he needed to die.

516
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,650
This is a key. You can't, I was having
trouble and I think even Jordan,

517
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:52,850
like we were trying to get the explained
that this is like a sick comedy,

518
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:56,360
like you can't really, we kept saying
back and forth to each other. We're like,

519
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,040
you can't make this up.
You can't make this up.

520
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:03,050
Like, you can't make that
up. And this is real. Yeah.

521
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,940
This a sick comedy. That's an interesting
yet I'm kinda accurate way it is. He,

522
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,060
you know, it's like, you know
how I can't think of an example.

523
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:14,780
You know how someone will, like,
he'll say, I dunno cable actually,

524
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,870
you know what it was? It was like
some cable commercial, is it,

525
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,750
they do this in a funny way of
comedy way. They'll say, hey,

526
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,270
don't get cable because if, and then
it'll say like, what does he say?

527
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,050
He says something like, yeah, if
you don't listen to your parents,

528
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:32,000
you don't do your homework.
If you don't do your homework,

529
00:35:32,001 --> 00:35:34,380
you don't get a good job if you
don't get a good job, you know?

530
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,350
And it's this whole thing.
And then crack house. Yeah.

531
00:35:37,351 --> 00:35:40,020
So don't end up in a crack
house, you know, kind of thing.

532
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:42,940
And the related to the city and it's
like, I see what you did there, you know,

533
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,750
and each one. Right. But it's
like you just being funny,

534
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:48,150
like obviously that's not that,
you know,

535
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,700
but they're just drawing all these
parallels, tear everything. So this one,

536
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:54,660
they must be the same, you know, kind of
thing, you know, like, yeah, if you get,

537
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,000
if you cancel cable,
I forget how it goes.

538
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,070
But you know, to your
point, this is that kind of,

539
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,030
this sounds like it just be that
crazy. Exactly. But this is real.

540
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,580
When our soldiers were sentenced to only
10 years for allowing themselves to be

541
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:14,170
taken prisoner action injurious to
the cell, Soviet military might,

542
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,460
this was humanitarian to
the point of being illegal.

543
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,830
According to the stolen this code,

544
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,550
they all should have been shot upon
their return home. So they're saying,

545
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,770
you know what,
the people that were allowed,

546
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,620
the Soviet soldiers that allowed
themselves to be captured,

547
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,210
they only got 10 years,

548
00:36:31,211 --> 00:36:33,490
which is actually kind of illegal
because they should have been shot

549
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:40,660
via article 19 of the criminal
code via intent. In other words,

550
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:42,070
no trees and had taken place.

551
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:47,071
But the interrogator envisioned an
intention to betray and that was enough to

552
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:51,130
justify a full term.
The same as actual.

553
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,220
So if I just think you had the intent,
that's good enough.

554
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,240
You're getting 10 years.

555
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,570
Section three was assisting in any way
or by any means a foreign state at war.

556
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,900
This section made it possible to condemn
any citizen who had been an occupied

557
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:05,680
territory,

558
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,700
whether he had nailed on the appeal of
a German soldier shoe or sold them a

559
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:12,640
bunch of radishes.
You get your Tanner right there.

560
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,390
There's these two things,
psh,

561
00:37:16,391 --> 00:37:19,980
which is suspicion of
espionage and an Nsh,

562
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,440
which is on proven Aspen espionage.

563
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,610
You can charge someone
with unproven espionage.

564
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,790
What does that even mean? Hey,
we're just, you know, we're,

565
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:34,050
you're guilty for unproven. It's like
you're guilty of unproven murder.

566
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,550
What does that mean? Oh, it's not proven,

567
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,380
but that's what you're guilty of
and that's why you're going to die.

568
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:41,820
Or maybe it's the kind of like, you know,
here they'll say like, hey, he, he's a,

569
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,970
he's in a legend. You know, before you
are proven in the court of law kind,

570
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,270
maybe you're in that window, you know, no,

571
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,780
nothing proven espionage and you're
going to go to prison for 10 years

572
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,330
years for it.
Section eight covered terror.

573
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:56,160
Terror was construed
in a very broad sense,

574
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:58,800
not simply a matter of putting
bombs under governors carriage is,

575
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:01,560
but for example,
smashing the face of a personal enemy.

576
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,510
If he was an activist in the party
or the police that was terror.

577
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,700
And then he starts talking about section
10 which is propaganda or agitation

578
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:16,350
containing an appeal for the overflow,

579
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,780
subverting or weakening
of the Soviet power.

580
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,280
Andy equally the dissemination or
preparation or possession of literary

581
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:27,030
materials of similar content. So
any, if you're drawn in propaganda,

582
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,550
you can get trouble.
But here we go.

583
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,700
The term preparation of literary materials
covered every letter note or private

584
00:38:36,491 --> 00:38:40,390
diary, even when only the
original document existed.

585
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,590
So Amy thing that you
write down is subject.

586
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,683
Yeah,

587
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,800
well that's why he went to
prison for a letter. Right.

588
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,800
The real wall underlying this,

589
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,910
the arrest all those years
was the assignment of quotas.

590
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,860
The norm set the planned allocations.
Every city, every district,

591
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:06,810
every military unit was
assigned a specific quota of
arrest to be carried out by

592
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:08,070
a stipulated time.

593
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,550
That's like when cops get the quota
for the speeding tickets. Yeah.

594
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,190
That's when you get the ticket for

595
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,220
for [inaudible] 38 in a 35.

596
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:26,200
Is that true though? Sometimes it
is. Again, I don't know. I thought,

597
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,530
I mean I thought it was true, but I
have no idea. Like is that just a myth?

598
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,350
You know how like people they, they're
just mad because they got a ticket,

599
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,520
you know, I call it photo but
it's not even real. You know,

600
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:40,900
like that's not even a real thing. I
have no idea. It could be a method.

601
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:42,370
I just believed. Yeah. You know,

602
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:45,870
cause you've probably got that
ticket when you're 38 in the 35.

603
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,370
Him and me neither.
That's why I'm questioning it.

604
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,200
I did get pulled over a few months
ago. But eyebrow. Your tinted windows.

605
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,790
No, I was going too fast in this
area. Oh, straight up. Speeding. Yeah.

606
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,480
Well you got off. They give
you a break. Yeah. Cause they,
they'd recognize, you know

607
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,330
what I think,
uh,

608
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,493
check

609
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:14,910
back to the book piles of
Victims Hills a victims.

610
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:18,330
Here's some other people got arrested
and electrician had a high tension line

611
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:21,630
break in his sector. 58, seven.

612
00:40:21,631 --> 00:40:23,910
That's the article 20 years,

613
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,370
okay.

614
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,530
A plumber turned off the
loud speaker in his room.

615
00:40:27,531 --> 00:40:30,050
Every time the endless letters
to Stalin were being read,

616
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,880
his next door neighbor denounced him.

617
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:37,690
Where aware is that neighbor today he
got soe socially dangerous element.

618
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,643
Eight years.

619
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,130
Okay.

620
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,540
By the end of numbered, by the end of
summer 1941 becoming bigger in the autumn,

621
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,420
the wave of the encircled was surging.
It again,

622
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:55,200
the waves talking about waves of prisoners
that are showing up and the waves of

623
00:40:55,201 --> 00:41:00,180
the encircled were surging in. These
were the defenders of their native land,

624
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,450
the very same warriors whom the cities
or had seen sent off to the front with

625
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:10,950
bouquets and bands a few months before
who had then sustain the heaviest tank

626
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:15,480
assaults of the Germans and in the general
chaos and through no fault of their

627
00:41:15,481 --> 00:41:20,160
own had spent a certain time as isolated
units, not in enemy imprisonment,

628
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:21,023
not at all,

629
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,410
but in temporary INCIRCL mint
and later had broken out.

630
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,120
You understand what that means?

631
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,940
It means they're surrounded by the
enemy didn't get captured by the enemy.

632
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,000
They get surrounded for a little
while and then they break out.

633
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,860
They'd get back to friendly lines and
instead of back to the book and instead of

634
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:41,861
being given a brotherly embrace on their
return such as every other army in the

635
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:43,100
world would have given them,

636
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:47,420
instead of being given a chance to rest
up to visit their families and then

637
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:52,070
return to their units. They were
held on suspicion, disarmed,

638
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,780
deprived of rights,

639
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,490
and taken away in groups to identification
points in screening centers were

640
00:41:58,491 --> 00:42:02,720
officers of the special branches
started interrogating them,

641
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,930
distrusting not only their every word,

642
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,090
but their very identity

643
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:15,970
traders of the motherland under 58 one B,

644
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:20,380
but at first until the standard
penalty was finally determined,

645
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,600
they got less than 10 years.

646
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,623
Yeah.

647
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,030
You can't imagine that
people would go along.

648
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,930
You can't imagine that people
go along with this, right? Yeah.

649
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,480
The level of fear that
you have to have as a,

650
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:44,630
as a nation and as a people
to go along with that,

651
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:49,160
right there are our frontline
troops were surrounded by the enemy.

652
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,410
They managed to escape and get back in.

653
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:53,660
Now we're going to put them on
trial and put them in prison.

654
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,540
It's, it's, it's insanity.

655
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,850
Next chapter talks about interrogation
going to the book.

656
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,360
If the intellectuals in the plays of
checkoff who spent all their time guessing

657
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:15,170
what would happen in 2030 or 40
years had been told that in 40 years

658
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,870
interrogation by torture
would be practiced in Russia,

659
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,680
that prisoners would have their
skulls squeezed with iron rings,

660
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,620
that a human being would be
lowered into an acid bath,

661
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:29,170
that they would be trust up naked to be
bitten by ants and bedbugs that are ram

662
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:33,560
rod heated over a primus stove
would be thrust up their anal canal.

663
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:38,250
The secret brand that a mans genitals
would be slowly crushed beneath the toll

664
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,200
the boot, and that in the
luckiest possible circumstances,

665
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,410
prisoners would be tortured by being kept
from sleeping for a week by thirst and

666
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,850
by being beaten to a bloody pulp.

667
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:54,980
Not one of checkoffs plays would have
gotten to its end because all the heroes

668
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:00,020
would have gone off to insane asylums
if the intellectuals and the plays of

669
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:04,760
checkoff who spent all their time guessing
what would happen in 2030 or 40 years

670
00:44:04,761 --> 00:44:09,170
had been told that in 40
years interrogation by
torture would be practiced in

671
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:09,950
Russia.

672
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,270
That prisoners would have their
skulls squeezed within iron rings,

673
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,870
that a human being would be
lowered into an acid bath,

674
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:22,880
that they would be trust up naked to be
bitten by ants and bedbugs that are ram

675
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:27,830
rod heated over a primus stove
would be thrust up their anal canal,

676
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:32,340
that a mans genitals would be
slowly crushed the Tova Jack boot,

677
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,640
and that in the luckiest
possible circumstances,

678
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,500
prisoners would be tortured by being kept
from sleeping for a week by thirst and

679
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:42,630
by being beaten into a bloody pulp.

680
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:48,350
Not one of checkoffs plays would have
gotten to its end because all the heroes

681
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:51,240
would have gone off to insane asylums.

682
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,160
Horrible.
So they have these,

683
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,460
they're doing these savage
interrogations and torture.

684
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,010
Continuing on the time allotted for
investigation was not used to unravel the

685
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:13,770
crime in 95 cases,

686
00:45:13,771 --> 00:45:18,771
out of 102 exhaust where down weaken and
render helpless the defendant so that

687
00:45:20,191 --> 00:45:23,040
he would want to end it at any cost.

688
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,690
Then he talks about some of
the methods that we're using.

689
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,540
He talked about some of the torture and
these were just some of the kind of the,

690
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:39,120
the basic, the, the, the base line
abuse that you're going to get.

691
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,260
You're going to get capped
from sleep. You're going to
get persuasion. They'd say,

692
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:46,860
look, you're going to get prison term no
matter what happens, but if you resist,

693
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,880
you croak right here in prison, you
lose your health. But if you go to camp,

694
00:45:50,881 --> 00:45:54,570
you'll have fresh air and sunlight.
So why not sign this paper right now?

695
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:56,830
Okay?

696
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:01,090
They do that. They do, they
do psychological contrast,

697
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:06,310
you know, good cop, bad cop, humiliation,
extreme confusion, intimidation.

698
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,760
They tell him we've got hard labor camps.
Now if you can fast,

699
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,130
you go to an easy camp.
But if you're starting or stubborn,

700
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,790
you'll get 25 years in handcuffs.
In the minds,

701
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,680
they'd lie. Of course they'd
play on the affections for those.

702
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,390
One loved

703
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:32,170
will arrest your daughter in locker
in this cell with syphilis sticks.

704
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,800
That's that one that they always throw,
right? They're going to break. Oh,

705
00:46:39,801 --> 00:46:42,870
they can't break you. Cool. Guess what
they're going to do to your daughter.

706
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,210
Guess what they're gonna do to your wife.

707
00:46:44,211 --> 00:46:45,650
Guess what they're
going to do to your son.

708
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:46,713
Hmm.

709
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,123
Now

710
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:01,110
he has a great paragraph and I talked
about this a little bit with Jordan,

711
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,670
but it's a reflecting on his behavior.

712
00:47:06,671 --> 00:47:09,600
And this is when he started
talking to him. And again, I

713
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,460
okay,

714
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,480
skip through a lot of the interrogation.
Um, you have to read the book.

715
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:18,600
You have to read the whole book,
and he to really jump into that,

716
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,740
I hit the high wave tops of it.

717
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,300
And this section, he's talking about the
guards, right? The people that they call,

718
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:30,400
he called them blue caps.
These are people that were the guards,

719
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:34,600
people that were processing
you through the gulags and

720
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:36,723
you know,
much like,

721
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:42,200
much like Jordan kinda talks about
seeing himself as the bad guy,

722
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,290
right? The perpetrator as opposed
to always seeing like, oh,

723
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:50,030
everyone thinks I wouldn't do that.
I'd be one of these victims. He,

724
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,020
uh,

725
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,020
social knits and sees himself in a
way he reflects on the way he behaved

726
00:47:56,721 --> 00:47:58,670
actually as an officer,

727
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:02,930
as a privileged officer
in the Russian army.

728
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,300
And this is,

729
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:10,390
this is such a great little section about
leadership because it tells you what

730
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:15,050
not to do as a leader.
So here we go.

731
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:19,730
And this is a great start off to this.
It starts off here. Back to the book.

732
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,640
Pride grows in the human heart,

733
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,520
like lard on a pig.

734
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:32,390
I tossed out orders to my subordinates
that I would not allow them to question,

735
00:48:32,391 --> 00:48:36,980
convinced that no orders could be wiser.
That's check number one right there.

736
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,990
There's,
these are things not to do as a leader.

737
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,100
I throw out orders to my subordinates
without letting them question them,

738
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:47,510
convinced in his own mind that da my
orders the best, worst, completely wrong.

739
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:49,701
Next,

740
00:48:49,701 --> 00:48:53,420
even at the front where one might have
thought death made equals of assault.

741
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,990
My power soon convinced me that
I was a superior human being

742
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:01,680
wrong.
You're not better than your troops.

743
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,660
Next seated there, I heard them
out as they stood at attention.

744
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,390
I interrupted them.
I issued commands.

745
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,620
I addressed fathers and grandfathers
with the familiar downgrading form of

746
00:49:13,621 --> 00:49:16,590
address.
While they of course address me formally,

747
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:23,140
I sent them out to repair wire under
shell fire so that my superiors would not

748
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:24,010
reproach me.

749
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,840
I ate my officer's ration of butter with
roles without giving a thought as to

750
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:36,320
why I had a right to do it and why the
rank and file soldiers did not. So,

751
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,210
hey,
we're out there in the field.

752
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,040
You're going to eat whatever shoe leather
and I'm over here eating my butter

753
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:44,390
would roles.
I,

754
00:49:44,391 --> 00:49:48,590
of course had a personal servant
assigned to me in polite terms,

755
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:53,330
an orderly whom I badgered one way or
another in order to look after my person

756
00:49:53,331 --> 00:49:55,700
and prepare my meals
separately from the soldiers.

757
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,900
I forced my soldiers to put their backs
into it and dig me a special dugout at

758
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:06,860
every new BIVOUAC and to haul the heaviest
beams to support it so that I would

759
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:09,620
be as comfortable and as safe as possible.

760
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,410
And wait a minute,
yes,

761
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:15,800
my battery always had a guard house
to meaning a little prison cell.

762
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,140
What kind of guard guardhouse
could there be in the woods?

763
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:21,980
It was a pit of course,
although it had a roof

764
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:23,803
on,
it

765
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,810
talks about imprisoning song.
Uh,

766
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:35,720
if he should cough was imprisoned there
for losing his horse and pop golf for

767
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:40,130
maltreating his car beand yes,
just a moment. I can remember more.

768
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,870
They sewed me a map case out of a German
hide, not human, but from a car seat,

769
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,830
but I didn't have a strap for
it and I was unhappy about that.

770
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,960
Then all of a sudden they saw some
partisan commissar from the local district

771
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:57,230
Party committee wearing just the right
kind of strap and they took it away from

772
00:50:57,231 --> 00:51:00,500
him. We are the army. We have seniority.

773
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,080
Yeah.

774
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,080
Finally I coveted that scarlet box and
I remember how they took it away and got

775
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:09,004
it.
For me,

776
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:14,050
that's what shoulder
boards do to a human being.

777
00:51:17,050 --> 00:51:21,640
So when you get rank,
when you put on those shoulder boards,

778
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,400
keep your ego in check.

779
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:25,863
Yeah.

780
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,110
Don't,
don't act like that.

781
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:31,360
Okay

782
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,200
then believe me,

783
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:37,060
I mean I saw plenty of people like act
like that in the military and they were

784
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,920
hated by their troops.

785
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:44,603
Okay.

786
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,860
Continuing on.

787
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,960
So let the reader who expects this book
to be a political [inaudible] slam,

788
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:54,560
it's covers shut right now.
If it were only all so simple,

789
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,660
if only there were evil people somewhere
insidiously committing evil deeds and

790
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:02,990
it were necessary only to separate them
from the rest of us and destroy them.

791
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:04,920
Yeah.

792
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,390
But the line dividing good and evil cuts
through the heart of every human being

793
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,110
and who is willing to destroy
a piece of his own heart.

794
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,600
So if you're not careful,
you got that evil in you.

795
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:22,693
Okay.

796
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,140
During the life of any heart,
this line keeps changing place.

797
00:52:26,141 --> 00:52:30,220
Sometimes it's squeezed one way by
exuberant evil and sometimes it shifts to

798
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:32,260
allow enough space for good to flourish.

799
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,620
One and the same human being is at various
ages and under various circumstances,

800
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:39,520
a totally different human being.

801
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:43,660
At times he's close to being
a devil at times to sainthood,

802
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,460
but his name doesn't change.

803
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:50,350
And to that name we ascribe
the whole lot good and evil.

804
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:59,930
And that's a line that you hear Jordan
Peterson read that line a lot or say that

805
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:00,924
line a lot.

806
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,660
The line dividing good and evil cuts
through the heart of every human being

807
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,910
cause we all got a little
piece of darkness in our
hearts that you need to watch

808
00:53:08,911 --> 00:53:09,780
out for.

809
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,793
Hmm.

810
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,760
Continuing on a little bit on that theme,

811
00:53:14,761 --> 00:53:18,030
the trouble lies in the way these
classic you evil doers are pictured.

812
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,910
They recognize themselves as evil doers,
doers,

813
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,890
and they know their souls are black.

814
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,970
And the reason I cannot leave unless
I do so I'll set my father against my

815
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:29,790
brother. I'll drink the victim
sufferings until I'm drunk with them.

816
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,260
But no,
that's not the way it is to do evil.

817
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:37,970
A human being must first of all,

818
00:53:37,971 --> 00:53:42,971
believe that what he is doing is good or
else that it's a well considered active

819
00:53:44,661 --> 00:53:46,430
in conformity with natural law,

820
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:50,610
fortunately is in the nature of
the human being to speak, uh,

821
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,100
to seek a justification for his actions,
ideology,

822
00:53:57,020 --> 00:54:00,200
ideology.
That is what gives evil doing.

823
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:04,940
It's long sought justification and
gives the evil doer the necessary

824
00:54:04,941 --> 00:54:09,710
steadfastness and determination that is
the social theory which helps to make

825
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:14,711
his axing good instead of bad in his own
eyes and other's eyes so that he won't

826
00:54:15,171 --> 00:54:19,400
hear reproaches and kerchiefs curses.
But we'll receive praise and honors.

827
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:26,110
That was how agents of the inquisition
fortified their wills by invoking

828
00:54:26,811 --> 00:54:27,680
Christianity,

829
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,670
the conquerors of foreign
lands by extolling the grand
jury of the motherland,

830
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:35,720
the colonizers by civilization,
the Nazis by race,

831
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:40,870
the Jacobeans early and late by equality
brotherhood and the happiness of future

832
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:44,570
generations.
Thanks to ideology.

833
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:50,200
The 20th century was faded to experience
evil doing on a scale calculated in the

834
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,990
millions. This cannot be denied
or passed over nor suppressed.

835
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:59,190
How then do we dare insists
that evil doers do not exist?

836
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,270
And who was it that destroyed
these millions? Without evil doers,

837
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:07,410
it would have been no archipelago.

838
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,300
So this is again,

839
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,440
something that we see a lot today when
people get on and we see it in the past.

840
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:21,170
Obviously he gave all the examples
right there. I mean the inquisition,

841
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:24,170
we haven't covered that on the
podcast yet, but we probably need to.

842
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,123
Hmm.

843
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,780
Because that was a damn nightmare.
Yeah.

844
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,210
And it was a nightmare with
people that were saying, hey,

845
00:55:31,211 --> 00:55:34,150
this is for the good of Christianity.
Yeah.

846
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,860
And you can go right on down the list
when people make, do people do evil,

847
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:45,130
they have this ideological oftentimes
have this ideological backing behind them.

848
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,330
They're doing it for this great cause.

849
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,300
And he gets here and I got a book in the,
um,

850
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,800
in the queue that's
probably going to get done,

851
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,960
which we're going to approach
this thing right here.

852
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:00,770
Evidently evil doing also
has a thresh hold magnitude.

853
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:02,570
Yes.

854
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:06,320
A human being hesitates and Bob's back
and forth between good and evil all his

855
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:10,910
life. He slips, falls back, clambers up,
repents. Things begin to dark and again,

856
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,360
just so long as the threshold
of evil doing is not crossed,

857
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,310
the possibility of returning remains
and he himself was still within reach of

858
00:56:19,311 --> 00:56:22,640
our hope.
But when through the density of evil,

859
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,010
the result either of their own extreme
degree of absoluteness of his power,

860
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,680
he suddenly crosses that threshold.

861
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:38,010
He has left humanity behind and without
perhaps the possibility of return.

862
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:45,190
So there's some situations where people
just go, they're not coming back.

863
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,400
They're just going to do evil.
That's the way it's going to be.

864
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:55,500
And I have a book in the queue right now
that we're probably going to do that.

865
00:56:55,501 --> 00:57:00,501
We'll explore that departure
from being able to return.

866
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:05,403
Okay?

867
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,680
Continuing on.

868
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:11,430
The only soldier in the world who cannot
surrender is the soldier of the world's

869
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:12,810
one and only Red Army.

870
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:19,020
That's what it says in our military
statutes. You cannot surrender,

871
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:24,510
no surrender. There is war,
there is death, but there is
no surrender of discovery.

872
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:29,160
What it means is go and die.
We will go on living.

873
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:34,700
And if you lose your legs yet managed to
return from calf captivity on crutches,

874
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:35,910
we will convict you.

875
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:42,140
And he mentions the lending grounder Ivan
off commander of a machine gun platoon

876
00:57:42,141 --> 00:57:46,460
in the Finnish war who lost
both legs and was imprisoned.

877
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:56,040
Incident lead is very naive to say
what for? In other words, what for,

878
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,670
why are they going to prison? At no
time have government's been moralist,

879
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:04,010
they never imprisoned people and executed
them for having done something they

880
00:58:04,441 --> 00:58:09,420
imprisoned and executed them to keep them
from doing something. They imprisoned.

881
00:58:09,421 --> 00:58:14,070
All those POW is of course not for
treason to the motherland because it was

882
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:18,480
absolutely clear even to a fool that only
the vlogs off men could be accused of

883
00:58:18,481 --> 00:58:21,450
treason, which is a group that
we'll talk about them a little bit.

884
00:58:21,451 --> 00:58:22,284
But there was a,

885
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:27,650
a general named wows off that actually
became a leader of Russian soldiers

886
00:58:28,111 --> 00:58:32,220
fighting against Russia alongside
the Nazis. Hmm. So he's saying, yeah,

887
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:35,770
those guys were traders against,
but the normal pow is a normal long,

888
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:39,900
they weren't traders back to the book.
They were imprisoned to all of them.

889
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:45,770
To keep them from telling their fellow
villagers about Europe will be eye,

890
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:49,650
doesn't see the heart,
doesn't grieve for.

891
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:54,270
So just because these people had seen
what it was like, you got to go to prison,

892
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:55,860
you know too much.

893
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,370
You could have acquired a very harmful
spirit through living freely among

894
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:06,300
Europeans. And if you had not been
afraid to escape and continue to fight,

895
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,680
it meant you were a determined person
and thus doubly dangerous in the

896
00:59:10,681 --> 00:59:11,514
motherland.

897
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,850
Thinking about that because you had the
courage to fight on and escape and get

898
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:18,151
back.

899
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:20,640
That means you're a courageous person
and you're even more of a threat because

900
00:59:20,641 --> 00:59:25,610
you know how live
totally backwards.

901
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:30,350
Now, like I said, this guy flies off. Um,

902
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:32,493
he,

903
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:38,170
he was surrounded and wanted to
retreat and got told no and they,

904
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,570
his army was basically a lot,
most of it was wiped out.

905
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:49,430
And then he was kind of
wandering and escaped somewhat,

906
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:51,680
and they joined up with a keep captured,

907
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,140
joined up with some other troops that
other Russian troops that were now pissed

908
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,590
off, right? That they didn't,
they, you what? You weak.

909
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,010
You wouldn't allow us to surrender.

910
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:03,350
You wouldn't allow us to break out
your windows, allow us to leave.

911
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:05,300
So they're pissed.
It stolen.

912
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,480
And so then they turned and these vias
off guys ended up fighting and I'm sure

913
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:15,680
we'll do a book on these guys
at some point. But um, you know,

914
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,390
he became,
he became the leader,

915
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:22,870
Andre Vilas off and they fought and
they fought hard because they know,

916
01:00:25,011 --> 01:00:28,100
they knew that they had no,

917
01:00:28,101 --> 01:00:32,480
and they weren't going to live if
they were captured. And in fact,

918
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,190
um,
Solzhenitsyn says when we captured them,

919
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:41,240
we shot them in as soon as the first
intelligible Russian word came from their

920
01:00:41,241 --> 01:00:46,100
mouths. The just straight up. That's
what we're doing. Oh, you speak Russian.

921
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:48,530
Cool. That means your blast
off, man. You're done.

922
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:56,230
The term of [inaudible] in our country
has the same force as the word sewage.

923
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:02,030
We feel we are during our mouths merely
by pronouncing it and therefore no one

924
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:05,900
deers dares otter. A sentence with
Velocify right in its subject.

925
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,480
But that is no way to write history.

926
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:13,190
Now a quarter century later when most
of them had perished and camps and those

927
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:15,680
who have survived or living out
their lives in the far north.

928
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:20,570
I would like to issue a reminder through
these pages that this was a phenomenon

929
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:24,800
totally unheard of in hauled
the whole history of the world,

930
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:30,160
that several hundred thousand young men
age 20 to 30 took up arms against their

931
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:36,050
father land as allies
of its most evil enemy.

932
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:37,670
Okay,

933
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:40,360
right. Seeing this never happened.
Hundreds of thousands of,

934
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,550
there was hundreds of thousands.
These flies off troops,

935
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:44,890
hundreds of thousands of them.

936
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:49,930
How do you get a hundreds of thousands
of men who are in the military like,

937
01:01:49,931 --> 01:01:52,750
okay, we get a traitor,
we get five traders,

938
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:58,170
hundreds of thousands,
and he says back to the book,

939
01:01:58,171 --> 01:02:03,171
perhaps there was something to ponder
here who was more to blame those youths or

940
01:02:03,211 --> 01:02:05,040
the gray fatherland

941
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:11,540
one cannot explain this
trees and biologically it had
to have had a social cause

942
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,390
because as the old proverb said,

943
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,840
well fed horses don't rampage

944
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:23,550
then picture yourself a field
in which starved, neglected,

945
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:26,730
crazed horses are
rampaging back and forth.

946
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:36,790
Continuing on.

947
01:02:37,770 --> 01:02:38,300
Okay.

948
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:42,110
There is a simple truth which one can
learn only through suffering in war.

949
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:44,480
Not Victories are blessed,

950
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:49,630
but defeats governments need
victories and the people need defeats.

951
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:54,980
Victory gives rise to the desire for
more victories. But after defeat,

952
01:02:55,430 --> 01:03:00,430
it is freedom that men desire and
usually attain a people needs defeat.

953
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:05,540
Just as an individual needs
suffering and misfortune,

954
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:10,840
they compel the deepening of the inner
life and generate a spiritual upsurge.

955
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:17,390
That's an interesting concept.
I mean that's uh,

956
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:22,800
that's what Joe Rogan talking about.
You need to have some struggle, right?

957
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:26,200
You need to have something
to get after. Yeah. And,

958
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:28,160
and Solzhenitsyn,

959
01:03:28,161 --> 01:03:31,940
sane people in a country
need that same thing.

960
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:35,060
We need that struggle.
They want that struggle.

961
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,870
And this is again,

962
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:48,040
this is the one we spent a little bit
of time on with Jordan and this is when,

963
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:50,860
when one of Social Knutson's,
uh,

964
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,290
friends in the prison

965
01:03:55,410 --> 01:03:59,100
Valentyn said, oh, they
were expecting amnesty.

966
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:02,370
There was expecting to be set free.
And here we go back to,

967
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:06,000
because we dried ourselves off balance
and said to me reassuringly intimately,

968
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,340
well, all right, we're still young.

969
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:12,030
We're going to live a long time yet the
main thing is not to make a misstep.

970
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:16,710
Now we are going to a camp and will not
say one word to anything so they won't

971
01:04:16,711 --> 01:04:20,460
plaster new terms in us. We'll work
honestly and keep our mouth shut.

972
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,220
And he really believed in his program,

973
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,910
that naive little kernel of grain of
caught between stound Stalin's millstones.

974
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:34,140
He really had his hopes set on it and
then he's talking about amnesty one wanted

975
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:38,370
to agree with them to serve out the
term Causley and then expunge from one's

976
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:40,320
head what one had lived through.

977
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:44,940
But I had begun to sense
a truth inside myself.

978
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,930
If in order to live it
is necessary not to live,

979
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,810
then what's it's off of
then what does it all for?

980
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:56,130
And of course Jordan and I got an a
bigger long discussion about playing the

981
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:59,930
game. And yeah, I mean I think we, uh,

982
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,580
both agreed that there's times where
you have to play the game a little bit.

983
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,670
Yeah.
And if you don't,

984
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:13,050
well you'll end up in a
worse position. Yeah. So

985
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:20,570
we started talking a little bit about
these kangaroo courts that went on.

986
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,700
And here's one of the
judges makes the statement,

987
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:28,810
we are not guided by laws but
by our revolutionary conscience.

988
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,100
So what does that mean?

989
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:32,440
That means we just make up whatever
the hell we want to make up.

990
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,360
Yeah, whatever we're going to make
up, that's what we're going to do. Um,

991
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,160
and in,
in

992
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,230
this book book part one of volume one,

993
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:51,910
he spends a lot of time talking about
these multiple cases. He goes through,

994
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:55,390
basically it's like court dramas and
he spells them out pretty good. I mean,

995
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:59,500
there's like a dialogue back and
forth between the accuser and,

996
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:04,270
and the defendants and you
know, the uproar from the
crowd and it's, it's like, uh,

997
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,780
it's like multiple court
dramas. One of them, um,

998
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:13,690
the Moscow church trial,
April 26th to May 7th, 1922,

999
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:17,380
there were 17 defendants including
arch priests and Laymen Accused of

1000
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:20,920
disseminating the Patriarchs proclamation.

1001
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,090
The charge was more important than
the question of surrendering or not

1002
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:29,740
surrendering church valuables.
And the presiding judge says,

1003
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:34,660
do you consider the state's law obligate
Tory or not? And the Patriarch says, yes.

1004
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:38,380
I recognize them to the extent
that they do not contradicts,

1005
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:41,940
contradicts the rules of peer piety,
Comrade Beck.

1006
01:06:41,941 --> 01:06:43,660
The presiding judge was astounded,

1007
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:48,070
which in the last analysis
is more important to you?

1008
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:53,220
The laws of the church or the point
of view of the Soviet government

1009
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,010
getting,
this is all spelled out,

1010
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:04,710
but it ends up May 7th the sentence
was pronounced of the 17 defendants,

1011
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,880
11 war to be shot.

1012
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:13,770
Okay.

1013
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:18,770
Another massive show trial
against the engineers that were,

1014
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:21,810
again, this goes back to the idea
that they were considered wreckers

1015
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,520
and they had these massive show trials
and here were some of the results of the

1016
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:28,354
show trials where they are,

1017
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:32,530
where they sentence these guys to massive
prison terms or sentence him to death.

1018
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:36,580
Thus it was attained with eight horse
traction. All the goals of the trial.

1019
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:41,440
One. All the shortages in the country,
including famine, cold lack of clothing,

1020
01:07:41,441 --> 01:07:45,370
chaos, an obvious stupidities we're
all blamed on the engineer wreckers

1021
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:52,070
to the people were terrified by the threat
of imminent intervention from abroad

1022
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,930
and were therefore prepared
for new sacrifices.

1023
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:59,730
Three leftist circles in the west
were warned of the intrigues of their

1024
01:07:59,731 --> 01:08:04,530
governments and for the solidarity
of the engineers was destroyed.

1025
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,760
All the intelligentsia was given a good
scare and left divided within itself.

1026
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:12,213
Hmm.

1027
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,340
Every of these show trials.

1028
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:17,563
Well,

1029
01:08:17,630 --> 01:08:21,680
if it wasn't for the fact that people
were being imprisoned or executed after

1030
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:26,660
the show trials, hmm. It would be a lot
of them. They seem like kangaroo courts.

1031
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:28,820
They seemed comical when you read them.

1032
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,260
Next chapter called the supreme measure,

1033
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,330
which is about capital punishment.

1034
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:43,770
Capital punishment has an up
and down history in Russia

1035
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,840
in the 20 central provinces of Russia.

1036
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:52,740
In a period of 16 months from June,
1918 to October,

1037
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:56,130
1919 more than 6,000 persons were shot,

1038
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:01,080
which is to say more than 1000 per month.

1039
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:05,910
The Revolution had hastened to rename
everything so that everything would seem

1040
01:09:05,911 --> 01:09:06,744
new.

1041
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:12,240
Thus the death penalty was
rechristened as the supreme measure.

1042
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,030
No longer a punishment,

1043
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:18,540
but a means of social defense.

1044
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,530
So they're executing a lot of people,

1045
01:09:24,531 --> 01:09:27,200
of course they're calling it the
supreme measure and they they, they,

1046
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:29,390
they refer to as social defense.

1047
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:33,080
Like we're just of how you
were just defending ourselves
right back to the book.

1048
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:36,830
And what kind of evil doers with
these condemned men's wear did?

1049
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:41,360
So many plotters and troublemakers
come from among them. For example,

1050
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:46,280
we're six collective farmers who
are guilty of the following crime.

1051
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:51,170
After they had finished
mowing the collective farm
along with their own hands,

1052
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:56,060
they had gone back and mowed a second
time along the hummocks to get a little

1053
01:09:56,061 --> 01:09:58,280
hay for their own cows.

1054
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,980
The all Russian at Central
Executive Committee refuse
to pardon all six of these

1055
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:05,420
peasants and sentence.

1056
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:09,230
And the sentence of
execution was carried out

1057
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:12,690
even if Stalin had killed no others.

1058
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:17,900
I believe he deserved to be drawn and
quartered just for the lies lives of those

1059
01:10:18,570 --> 01:10:23,130
six peasants.
So there you go.

1060
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:28,200
You already harvested all the
grain you can and then you go out,

1061
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:32,040
you do another run to get a little bit,
hey for your own cows and they kill you.

1062
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:45,460
During those two years of 1937 and 1938
a half million political prisoners had

1063
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:51,401
been shot throughout the Soviet Union
and 480,000 habitual fees in addition.

1064
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:58,820
So we're talking execution on just
a mass scale that's two years.

1065
01:10:59,750 --> 01:11:01,850
1 million just rattled off

1066
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:05,060
a million.

1067
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,400
Okay.

1068
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,310
Back to the book. And almost
always a person obediently allows

1069
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,690
himself to be killed.

1070
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:17,290
Yeah.

1071
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:20,560
Why is it that the death penalty
has such a hypnotic effect?

1072
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:25,860
Those pardoned recall hardly anyone in
their cell who offered any resistance.

1073
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:35,310
Does hope lend strength
or does it weaken a man?

1074
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,260
That's a good question,
isn't it?

1075
01:11:40,261 --> 01:11:43,890
It does hope lend strength
or does it weaken a man?

1076
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:51,140
You had a talk that I witnessed
recently and you mentioned this,

1077
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,850
something you just sorta mentioned for
the first time that I heard where you

1078
01:11:55,851 --> 01:12:00,570
were talking about hell week when
you said that they'd say, hey,

1079
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,810
you know, you don't get much
sleep. Right. And they say, okay,

1080
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:07,980
now we're going to give you guys a break.
You know, six hours sleep. Yeah, yeah, no,

1081
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:09,360
they'd say something like,
Hey look,

1082
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:13,620
your hell week has been extra hard and
we went too hard on you by accident and

1083
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,300
the water was colder than normal.

1084
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,780
So what we're gonna do is
we're going to give you guys,

1085
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:19,770
we don't normally do this,

1086
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:23,700
we're going to give you guys an eight
hour recovery period. It's so go,

1087
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:27,060
go put on warm clothes. You know
you're going to go in the barracks,

1088
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:28,200
you're not going to go in the tense.

1089
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,330
You're going to go in your
barracks putting a war,

1090
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:34,110
put on your dry clothes and getting
your beds and you guys are waking up at

1091
01:12:34,111 --> 01:12:38,190
eight hours. Yeah, but we need to do
a little training pause right now.

1092
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,460
And then, and then they
put you in, did they do it?

1093
01:12:41,461 --> 01:12:44,160
And then they put you in there and you
get all dry and then they put you on your

1094
01:12:44,161 --> 01:12:45,480
bed and you're all my sounds.

1095
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:50,340
And then 20 minutes later they come in
with machine guns and they wake you up

1096
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,980
and say, go get this. Or
if again, and they do.

1097
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,540
And that's one of the things that
gets a lot of people to quit. Yeah.

1098
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,500
It's a lot of people to quit. Right. So
that's kind of the point where, yeah,

1099
01:12:58,501 --> 01:13:03,270
the hope can Jim Ula? Oh yeah.
Where that hope, you know like,

1100
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:03,571
oh,

1101
01:13:03,571 --> 01:13:06,480
I can't believe in the one it's taken
away from you real quick or something like

1102
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:11,160
that. Oh yeah. Well this is a great
question because think if, okay,

1103
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:15,990
if you're in a situation where
you could live or die, right.

1104
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:21,330
There's times where, hey, if I'm going
to die, it makes me stronger. Like, Hey,

1105
01:13:21,331 --> 01:13:23,400
I'm going to go out hardly
ever. Yeah, exactly right.

1106
01:13:23,490 --> 01:13:25,830
But also like if I can hope I can live,

1107
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:29,850
then that can make you like a fucking
fight a little bit longer if I hope of

1108
01:13:29,851 --> 01:13:32,280
survival. Yeah. So there's hope.

1109
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:33,680
Okay.

1110
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,680
Lends strength or does it weaken Amanda
and there's different cases where it

1111
01:13:36,681 --> 01:13:40,700
does different things to you? Yeah.
Depends on what kind of strength to,

1112
01:13:40,701 --> 01:13:45,190
I feel like, yeah, I
dunno. Hope of what to do.

1113
01:13:45,191 --> 01:13:49,010
Like for sure of life is different.
Life and death because death,

1114
01:13:49,011 --> 01:13:52,280
that's the end of everything. That's
like, you know, but like, yeah,

1115
01:13:52,281 --> 01:13:54,590
but think about this situation you're,
this is talking about death.

1116
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:56,750
Like you're going to be executed.
So let me ask you this.

1117
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:00,410
So you're going to be executed.
But there's, if there's a
little bit of hope that,

1118
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:00,561
oh,

1119
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:04,880
maybe the sentence will get overturned
or maybe I'll get pushed down the road.

1120
01:14:04,881 --> 01:14:07,900
Or maybe they'll do an amnesty and
I'll get out. That's hope, right? Yeah.

1121
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:13,030
So that might weaken you, right?
Because if you're like, look,

1122
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:15,760
I'm getting executed and I don't care.
And you know what,

1123
01:14:15,761 --> 01:14:17,340
when that guard comes in here,
it's hot.

1124
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:19,990
Get some of my buddies and we're
going to get after it. Oh yeah. Right.

1125
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:21,250
So that's going to make you stronger.

1126
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,970
So hope might not necessarily be
a good thing. I mean, you know,

1127
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,650
if you ever encountered
someone that had no hope,

1128
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:33,190
they can be very scary individuals because
they don't care if they live or die.

1129
01:14:33,191 --> 01:14:37,780
They don't got nothing to lose and
nothing to lose, nothing to lose.

1130
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:42,250
You ever see a sports game
where it can go like, like a,

1131
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:45,850
a team gets a good lead and then they
just start taking risks and they start

1132
01:14:45,851 --> 01:14:49,660
dominating, right? Yeah. I mean it can
happen where they can start getting cocky,

1133
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:54,760
but like, uh, you can see a sports
game where it happens in fights.

1134
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:57,970
It happens in MMA fights that I
started getting the upper hand.

1135
01:14:57,971 --> 01:15:00,160
It happens in Jujitsu.
I started getting the upper hand.

1136
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,740
I take a little bit more risk,
but the risk,

1137
01:15:02,741 --> 01:15:07,210
as long as the risk pay off that Nelson
and you're, if you and I are rolling,

1138
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,750
I take a little risk like I up for the
takedown. Right? I'm feeling cocky.

1139
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:15,160
Go for the take down. I get the take down
right now all of a sudden your, your,

1140
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,870
your hope those down. Right. And
mine's going up more and more. Yeah.

1141
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:25,140
But if you're really tired and the rounds
almost over and you already lost and

1142
01:15:27,371 --> 01:15:30,400
now you're just like, well, I got no hope,
I'm just going to try for an arm lock.

1143
01:15:30,490 --> 01:15:34,840
You might get it. Yeah. Yeah.
And that's what I was going
to say too. It's like, man,

1144
01:15:34,841 --> 01:15:38,170
it's the on both sides. So it just
depends. Both really the answer is well,

1145
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,910
because like look,
MMA analogy,

1146
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:44,320
good one in my opinion to where let's
say I'm down as a football team as a

1147
01:15:44,321 --> 01:15:47,500
whatever, and you start throwing hail,
Mary's doing that kind of stuff. You know,

1148
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:50,560
it's like you have kind of less
hope we're going to lose anyway.

1149
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:53,920
Nothing to lose situation.
So it does give you strength in that way.

1150
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:57,010
But at the same time, if you way
ahead, yeah, I can take more risks.

1151
01:15:57,011 --> 01:16:00,460
I'll put my second string guys in
there, give them some reps, whatever.

1152
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:03,250
Cause if you know, if the, if the
risk does it pay off of whatever,

1153
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:07,210
we're still ahead so we're, you know,
man, I don't know. Yeah. It just depends.

1154
01:16:07,211 --> 01:16:09,310
You know what? I think
the, the thing is here,

1155
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:14,110
you got to pay attention as a human
to what the hope is doing to you.

1156
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:17,890
Right. It just gives us a good lesson
learned to what is the hope doing?

1157
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:19,420
Cause it happens in your life too,
right?

1158
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,430
Like maybe or like had
a job and you're like,

1159
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:24,640
well I might get that promotion
so I'm just going to stick it out.

1160
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:28,100
I'm just gonna stick it out a
little bit longer and then the butt.

1161
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,280
Whereas if you're like, hey, you're
not getting promoted, you'd be like,

1162
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:32,110
all right and you don't want to do
is I'm gonna get my resume together,

1163
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:34,960
I'm going to get my act together and
I put that word. If you have hope,

1164
01:16:34,961 --> 01:16:39,160
it makes you a little weaker. Yeah.
So you've got to pay attention to it.

1165
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,680
But it could make you stronger
though. It'd be like, oh,

1166
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:44,290
I might get the promotion so I'm going to,
I'm going to work hard.

1167
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:48,400
You gotta pay attention to where hope is
doing to you. That's what you gotta do.

1168
01:16:49,570 --> 01:16:53,560
Hope isn't always good. It's not bad.
It was not good. You got figure out,

1169
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:57,670
you got to monitor your hope. Don't
get your hopes up. You know like that.

1170
01:16:57,671 --> 01:17:00,700
Could you hope you had a monitor?

1171
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:05,020
That whole fit their monitor your
hope. There you go. That continues on.

1172
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:05,620
Here we go.

1173
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:09,980
If the condemned men and every sale
had ganged up on the as they came in

1174
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:10,910
and and choked them,

1175
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,590
wouldn't this have ended executioners
sooner than the appeals to the all Russian

1176
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:20,591
central executive committee when one
is already on the edge of the grave?

1177
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:23,000
Why not resist,

1178
01:17:24,260 --> 01:17:28,130
but wasn't everything for doomed
anyway from the moment of arrest.

1179
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:33,580
Yet all the arrested crawled along the
path of hope on their knees as if their

1180
01:17:35,481 --> 01:17:37,490
legs had been amputated.

1181
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:43,880
Monitor your hope wanted it.
Oh,

1182
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:49,910
he describes sort of death row.
In one of the prisons,

1183
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:54,970
there were four death cells in this prison
in the same corridor as the juvenile

1184
01:17:55,641 --> 01:17:59,570
cells and the hospital's cells.
The death cells had two doors,

1185
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,460
the customary wooden door with a
people and door made of iron grading.

1186
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:09,440
Each door had two locks and one
jailer had the block supervisor.

1187
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:14,510
Each had a key one jailer and of the
blocks supervisor each had a key to a

1188
01:18:14,511 --> 01:18:19,010
different one, so the doors could
only be opened by the two together.

1189
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:24,160
Sell 43 was on the other side of a
wall of the interrogators office.

1190
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:28,640
And at night, while the condemned
men were waiting to be executed,

1191
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:33,680
their ears were tormented by the
screams of prisoners. Being tortured.

1192
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,920
Talks about the idea of hunger strikes,

1193
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,530
which they did some hunger
strikes along the way

1194
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,790
from our experience in the past
and our literature of the past.

1195
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:01,660
We have derived a naive faith
in the power of a hunger strike.

1196
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,460
But the hunger strike is
purely a moral weapon.

1197
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:11,490
It presupposes that the jailer has not
entirely lost his conscience or that the

1198
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:18,280
jailer is afraid of public opinion.

1199
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:23,290
Only in such circumstances
can it be effective.

1200
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:28,840
So yeah, the, the Soviet prison, I
didn't care. Say whatever you want.

1201
01:19:28,841 --> 01:19:31,390
We control the press. Oh, and by the way,

1202
01:19:31,391 --> 01:19:35,260
you think I'm gonna feel guilty that
you're starving. No one, not a lot of, oh,

1203
01:19:35,261 --> 01:19:38,440
and by the way, if I do feel like I want
to make you live, guess what? They did?

1204
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:39,970
Forced artificial feeding.

1205
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:44,620
This method was adapted without any
question from the experience with wild

1206
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,060
animals in captivity.

1207
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:50,050
Artificial feeding has
much in common with rape.

1208
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:57,180
And that's what it really is for big men
hurled themselves on one week being in

1209
01:19:57,730 --> 01:20:00,100
deprivate of its one interdiction.

1210
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:05,490
They only need to do it once and what
happens to it next is not important.

1211
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:11,580
The of rape in hears in the
violation of the victims will,

1212
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:16,290
it's not going to be the way you want it,
but the bay,

1213
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:20,610
but the way I want it lie down and submit,

1214
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:24,710
they pry open the mouth with a flat disk,

1215
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:29,930
then broadened the crack between the
jaw and insert a tube, swallow it.

1216
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:32,270
And if you don't swallow it,

1217
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:37,450
they shove it down farther any way and
then pour liquefied food right down the

1218
01:20:37,491 --> 01:20:42,491
esophagus and then they massage the
stomach to prevent the prisoner from

1219
01:20:42,891 --> 01:20:44,090
resorting to vomiting.

1220
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:45,810
Yeah,

1221
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:49,920
the sensation is one of
being morally defiled.

1222
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:56,813
Okay.

1223
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,830
And
this is,

1224
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:06,900
it's the,
it's the closing of this part of the book.

1225
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:14,190
We no longer know the
answer to the question.

1226
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:19,280
Is the soul of a person in the new type
prison in the special purpose prison

1227
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,680
purified or does it
parish once and for all?

1228
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:33,500
If the first thing you see each and every
morning is the eyes of your cellmate

1229
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:36,240
who has gone insane,

1230
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:41,010
how then shall you save yourself

1231
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:43,910
during the coming day?

1232
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:56,590
And like I said, that's,
I'll take that as a,

1233
01:21:56,591 --> 01:21:59,020
as a spot to close out that

1234
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:03,730
part one of this book about the Gulag,

1235
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:07,920
and I think that

1236
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:15,230
is a question that we
can ask ourselves all up.

1237
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:20,333
Okay,

1238
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:24,250
in our current
world,

1239
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,140
but how can we save ourselves every day?

1240
01:22:27,141 --> 01:22:30,140
When you look around at the world

1241
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:34,690
when it looks sometimes like
the world is going insane,

1242
01:22:34,900 --> 01:22:37,270
when people are going crazy,

1243
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:43,520
you have to kind of work
to save yourself everyday.

1244
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:48,580
You have to pull yourself back into
sanity in back onto the path and not allow

1245
01:22:51,921 --> 01:22:56,921
yourself to become a prisoner
of your own personal gulag.

1246
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:07,090
And these gulags,
these Soviet gulags,

1247
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:14,210
if you want to build your own
personal gulag in your life,

1248
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:18,080
you do it the same way
that the Soviets did it.

1249
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,810
You do it with lies,

1250
01:23:25,580 --> 01:23:28,130
lies on top of lies.

1251
01:23:30,970 --> 01:23:35,970
When the Soviets lied on top of lies
to build these gulags and in your life,

1252
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:39,580
if you lie to yourself,

1253
01:23:39,581 --> 01:23:43,600
if you allow that to happen and
you put lies on top of lies,

1254
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:48,310
you will build yourself
your own personal gulag.

1255
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,073
Yeah.

1256
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,850
So
don't allow it.

1257
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:01,760
Don't lie to yourself.

1258
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:03,903
Okay.

1259
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:07,850
And instead you keep
yourself out of that prison.

1260
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:15,030
We keep yourself free by telling yourself

1261
01:24:16,770 --> 01:24:17,603
the truth.

1262
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,490
And I think that's all I've got

1263
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:29,850
for tonight.
And I know Echo,

1264
01:24:29,851 --> 01:24:34,851
you've got some the ways that we can kind
of help keep ourselves free by staying

1265
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:39,510
on the path. Sure. On top of telling
the truth on top of telling the truth,

1266
01:24:39,511 --> 01:24:43,950
which is kind of the key,
right? The key element.

1267
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,690
It's a key element for sure. I was still
kind of tripping on the hope thing,

1268
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:53,280
you know, if that gives you
strength or, or takes it from you.

1269
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:57,000
Right. That's how you put it or that's how
he put it. Right. It takes it from you.

1270
01:24:57,870 --> 01:25:01,620
I was, I was talking to Dakota. Yeah.

1271
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:06,980
The other night and we were
talking about after the big event,

1272
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,940
we know where he lost
his team and all that.

1273
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:16,490
And we just talked a little
bit more detail about the,

1274
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:19,020
if you remember in the book,
a few days later,

1275
01:25:19,021 --> 01:25:23,460
he goes on another operation that's just
as crazy or maybe not just as crazy,

1276
01:25:23,461 --> 01:25:25,730
but it's like it's really bad.
Yeah.

1277
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,060
And he was doing some definitely some,

1278
01:25:30,090 --> 01:25:33,570
some crazy things and putting,

1279
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:39,020
what's the military term that we say he
was going above and beyond the call of

1280
01:25:40,441 --> 01:25:43,740
duty and putting himself at great risk.

1281
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,970
And I said to him, you know, we were,
we were kind of like lab, you know,

1282
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,620
Dakota is so good to go and so awesome.
And we were just like laughing.

1283
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:55,920
And I was like, well, you didn't see, I
mean, at that point I'm like, you just,

1284
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,970
you know, you lost your whole team. I
go, you didn't care if you lived or died.

1285
01:25:59,971 --> 01:26:04,040
He goes, naughty. Not at all. Yeah. And

1286
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,270
so when that situation that he had no
hope at that moment in time. Right.

1287
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:12,050
And guess what he did? Whatever
he had to do. He's like, Oh,

1288
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:12,771
I've got to go save the,

1289
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:16,190
I'm going to go run across open field
where there's machine gun fire coming.

1290
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:20,570
Cool. I'll go, oh wait new dude again.
I'll go again. Oh I need to do it again.

1291
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,020
I'll go again. Yeah.
Cause he didn't have hope.

1292
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:28,250
And in fact that he didn't have hope.
Gave him strength at that moment. Yeah.

1293
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,540
You know, at that moment. But if you
talk to them now it's for versed.

1294
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:36,200
He's got his kids, got his little
daughters, you know what I mean?

1295
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,780
He's got like hope for the future.
Yeah.

1296
01:26:39,290 --> 01:26:42,470
And that's what makes me strong
right now until keeps him strong.

1297
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:49,040
What's the formula? Right. And I mean
it's, the formula is monitor your home.

1298
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:53,300
That's the formula. And it
depends on who you are, right.

1299
01:26:53,301 --> 01:26:55,850
Because they consider yourself,
let's say all hope is lost, you know,

1300
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:59,480
I gotta you know, go across, do all
these crazy things above and beyond.

1301
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:02,180
I could be, if I have a different
attitude, I could be like, why?

1302
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:07,160
Like why fight it kind of thing.
That death, impending doom, you know,

1303
01:27:07,161 --> 01:27:09,710
just kind of take its course
kind of thing. Right. I mean,

1304
01:27:09,711 --> 01:27:13,130
could complete disregard for
his own safety. That's the,

1305
01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:17,690
that's the phrase I was
looking for. Complete disregard
for his own safety. Yeah.

1306
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:20,210
But that's like a specific like
approach, you know, that's it.

1307
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:23,390
Like a different attitude. You know,
like some people they'll be like, oh,

1308
01:27:23,391 --> 01:27:28,330
I'm gonna, you know, like I'm, I'm doomed
anyway. So why fight it? And then right,

1309
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:32,600
like I'm doing, so just start swinging
for the fence and check this out.

1310
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,450
You could also be like,
I hope I can make it out of here.

1311
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:37,790
So what I'm going to do is I'm
just gonna hide right here.

1312
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:41,870
And you didn't do anything that's
the same. This like the reverse.

1313
01:27:41,871 --> 01:27:44,300
It's the reverse. So
it's like, and then if,

1314
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:48,170
if you're in a bad situation and you're
like, well, I hope I can make it.

1315
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:50,810
I've got hope that I can
live through this situation,

1316
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:55,520
so I'm just going to get down. I'm just
gonna hide. Get behind this little,

1317
01:27:55,810 --> 01:28:00,230
you know, rock outcropping and hope this
goes away. Right. Hope they don't see me.

1318
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,870
Hope. Hope. Hope, hope. Yeah, and
that's the example of the home.

1319
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:05,270
Guess what happens when you do that?

1320
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:09,320
The enemy maneuvers on you and you'd
get killed. Whereas if you go like,

1321
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:14,210
you know what, I'm going out, I
have no hope I'm going to attack.

1322
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:15,770
But by the way,

1323
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,890
the enemy who's hoping they can take
you and hoping that you're going to stay

1324
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:22,100
there when you, when you do
something that they didn't hope for,

1325
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:26,330
that's going to smack him in the face.
But like if,

1326
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:29,870
but then on the reverse side of that,
right,

1327
01:28:29,871 --> 01:28:32,240
let's say you have a different attitude
even though you have hope, right?

1328
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:34,310
If all is lost,
do you think,

1329
01:28:34,311 --> 01:28:38,000
but I have this little shred of hope so
I'm just going to go throw a hail Mary

1330
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,100
that's hope really.

1331
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:43,550
Rather than just like cowering in
the corner and dying or whatever.

1332
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:48,580
But you wouldn't be throwing a hail
Mary unless that was the only way.

1333
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:53,000
Like that was your only hope. Shred of
hope was the only, I'm saying like if you,

1334
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:55,910
that's what I'm saying. Like, if you
have two different approaches, you know,

1335
01:28:56,330 --> 01:29:00,330
monitor your hope at the end of the day,
that's going to monitor your home on,

1336
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:02,160
got to make sure that what?
Cause

1337
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:06,630
there's, you gotta be careful too because
sometimes you know, if you have no hope,

1338
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:09,810
right? If you out well, I have no hope so
I'm just gonna cause you could do that,

1339
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:13,170
right? Let's say you're in a bad
situation, a combat situation. Hey,

1340
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:15,130
I got no hope so I'm just
going to lay here and like,

1341
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:17,550
I guess this is what you were
saying. Oh yeah, I got no hope.

1342
01:29:17,551 --> 01:29:20,280
So I'm just gonna lay here instead of,
hey,

1343
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:24,450
I got no hope so I'm just going to go out
in a blaze of glory. Let's get science.

1344
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:29,670
Yeah, go down swinging approach.
So if you monitor it, you go,

1345
01:29:29,671 --> 01:29:33,750
wait a second. I have no hope. Okay.
I'm going to at least go out hard.

1346
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,580
I'm going to go get some at a minimum,
right?

1347
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:41,580
I'm going to take some people with me,
bad guys.

1348
01:29:41,940 --> 01:29:46,710
We'll save some of my good
guys if I can do that. Yeah,

1349
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:49,770
that's good. As opposed to, hey,
there's no hope, we're doomed.

1350
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,190
Monitor your hope.

1351
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,310
Remember that? Remember
Shawshank redemption? Yes.

1352
01:29:56,311 --> 01:30:00,600
I have seen that movie where he was
like, Hey, the guy read Morgan Freeman.

1353
01:30:00,630 --> 01:30:05,430
He's insane. Hey, don't be
careful with that whole thing.
It will drive you insane.

1354
01:30:05,431 --> 01:30:06,264
Or something like that.

1355
01:30:06,570 --> 01:30:09,270
Like if you hope you'll get out or
you hope you're going to get part into

1356
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:13,380
whatever his situation
was. So it's like, yeah,

1357
01:30:13,381 --> 01:30:15,990
if you hope you'll get pardoned
and you hold onto that hope,

1358
01:30:15,991 --> 01:30:18,870
but you get let down, it will
create, it will drive you insane.

1359
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:23,310
And if you don't have hope and not do what
he's implying, if you don't have hope,

1360
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:28,340
you just said basically accept your
imprisonment so you can focus on our

1361
01:30:28,411 --> 01:30:32,520
concentrate unliving prison life.
You know the way it needs to be lived,

1362
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:35,520
so to speak. Do the best
you can there. Yeah.

1363
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:38,610
Like don't have these hopes so the
outside cause it'll make you crazy.

1364
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:43,590
That could be decent advice in a situation
like that. Yeah. One of those deals.

1365
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:44,670
Monitor your hope

1366
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,720
is what he was saying.
That's what he was saying.

1367
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:51,650
It's saying monitor your hope
because right. If you have
no hope, you can be like,

1368
01:30:51,651 --> 01:30:54,440
well, I'm just gonna just gonna kill
myself. Yeah, exactly. Right. Yeah,

1369
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:59,030
and I know you've got a monitor
it in the prison. All right.

1370
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,690
And you got to make sure that you're not
putting yourself in a personal prison.

1371
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,430
Yeah. Which I, which that to me,

1372
01:31:07,431 --> 01:31:08,570
this idea,

1373
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:13,610
if you think about the bad
situations in your life,

1374
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:17,870
most of them are predicated on you
lying to yourself about something.

1375
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:23,290
Yeah. Yeah. Your everyday
ones for sure. Yeah.

1376
01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:26,860
Right. Yeah. It's weird. Every time
you, like you say something like that,

1377
01:31:26,861 --> 01:31:29,560
how I always try to think of something
rebuttal. You know? It's weird.

1378
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:33,520
I feel myself doing that, but yeah,
no, you're right. Yeah. I think so

1379
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,920
that you just tell these little
lies lies on top of lies and,

1380
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:42,960
and what's what I think what
happens with lies on top of lies is

1381
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,960
they become easier and easier to believe.
Oh yeah.

1382
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,290
Like once you believe one of your
own lives, then you believe three,

1383
01:31:49,291 --> 01:31:51,660
then you believe 10 then
you believe a hundred. Yeah.

1384
01:31:51,661 --> 01:31:54,390
You know what the feeling is, the
feeling is you lie to yourself, right?

1385
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,950
And or you could, a lot of times
lying to yourself isn't like, hey,

1386
01:31:59,020 --> 01:32:01,390
I'm tall. When you're not
taught, it's not that. It's like,

1387
01:32:01,720 --> 01:32:05,350
it's more of a not admitting certain
things. That's more what it is. You know?

1388
01:32:05,351 --> 01:32:08,230
Like when you saw how you
can say, he say, look,

1389
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:11,650
take a good hard look at yourself
in the mirror. Right end.

1390
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:12,840
And don't lie to yourself.
Right.

1391
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:15,040
So it's usually when you lie to
yourself in the mirror, it's like, oh,

1392
01:32:15,041 --> 01:32:16,630
I won't admit that I won't,

1393
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,530
I won't admit that to myself that I
need this or I should get rid of this or

1394
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:24,250
whatever. That's how the light comes.
You know? It's a lie by omission.

1395
01:32:24,251 --> 01:32:26,890
I think this look, then the more
you do it, yeah. But then you,

1396
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:29,380
and then you lived to see another
day. Whoa. It's a miracle.

1397
01:32:29,381 --> 01:32:33,100
So it must kind of be true.
It must not be that big of a deal.

1398
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:35,230
My whatever,
you know,

1399
01:32:35,350 --> 01:32:38,020
like donuts that I eat every
morning for breakfast must not be,

1400
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:39,900
I'm still here for those arise.

1401
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,590
So it is so in,
no one's bringing it up.

1402
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:48,400
No one's bringing it up to me kind of
thing. So it's like it's not really,

1403
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,670
it's not like pulling at me that much.
So it gets easier and easier to kind of,

1404
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:55,660
it's almost like sweeping it under
the rug kind of thing. You know?

1405
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:58,150
Meanwhile that's festering and festering.
Oh,

1406
01:32:58,151 --> 01:33:01,870
she'd go to the doctor cholesterol so
high or whatever. See what I'm saying?

1407
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,710
That's how it'll jam. Ya'll don't lie
to yourself, you know, what else is it?

1408
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:09,400
Prison being on bottom,
stuck in your side,

1409
01:33:09,401 --> 01:33:14,200
control in Jujitsu to prison.
So, and here's the weird thing,

1410
01:33:14,230 --> 01:33:17,000
when you,
when he said that I,

1411
01:33:17,190 --> 01:33:20,260
I did think of this where if I have,
and it's,

1412
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,970
I don't even know if I'd call it hope.

1413
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:27,280
Like if I want to be out,
like if I want to escape,

1414
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:33,060
not that I want to do the escape room
or take escape type actions is just I

1415
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:37,720
don't want to be there all like it.
Way less like a won't,

1416
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:41,080
I won't be able to deal with
it as much as if I say, okay,

1417
01:33:42,610 --> 01:33:46,060
I'm here. It's like accepting that
I'm an insight control, you know,

1418
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:50,320
and I have to take action here. My
hope is here, not outside there.

1419
01:33:50,321 --> 01:33:53,170
See what I'm saying? You have to
accept the situation that you're in.

1420
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:57,040
You can't lie to yourself.
Lie Little prison. Anyway.

1421
01:33:57,190 --> 01:33:59,590
I think that's what Morgan Freeman
was talking about by the way.

1422
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:03,610
Nonetheless we can site control.
That's Jujitsu. Speaking of Jujitsu,

1423
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:07,770
you're going to need a geek if you're
an in doing Jujitsu. Indeed. Yeah.

1424
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:10,150
We're on the path. We're talking
about the path right now. Right.

1425
01:34:10,360 --> 01:34:13,750
Support yourself in this way by saying
in the path to starting. Do you too.

1426
01:34:13,751 --> 01:34:14,584
If you haven't already.

1427
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:18,730
A lot of people starting to get to a
lot more people started jujitsu getting

1428
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:22,540
popular, very popular and for
good reason too. I mean shoot,

1429
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,510
so when you get a g and a rash
guard get origin g no question.

1430
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:34,270
Oh, you don't want to agree with me. I
agree with her. That's what I thought.

1431
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:39,250
Anyway. Origin, main.com origin main.com.

1432
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,150
It's the,

1433
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:45,610
I guess the look that I was giving you
is sort of the fact that we just glossing

1434
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:48,250
over the fact that these
geezer made 100% in America.

1435
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:54,390
Yeah, yeah. Maybe I should talk
about the last time you did,

1436
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,320
you talked about the looms and all
that stuff today you're just, Hey,

1437
01:34:57,321 --> 01:34:58,070
the best ski so which

1438
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:01,970
I guess that's cool. Yeah, they
are. They are all is true for sure.

1439
01:35:02,180 --> 01:35:06,620
100% yeah and, and you know what,
I'm a, I was just about to say this,

1440
01:35:06,621 --> 01:35:10,760
but I remembered that I do talk about
this all the time on air and off air.

1441
01:35:10,850 --> 01:35:15,140
That it is cool. It kind of like how
Pete guys, how they brought back like

1442
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:21,020
the actual making of the g for example.
Like that's a thing now it's like cool.

1443
01:35:21,021 --> 01:35:25,100
Now no one cared about how your g was
stitched him and like no one cared about

1444
01:35:25,101 --> 01:35:25,934
that stuff.

1445
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:30,920
Even if they knew the pearl competitions
last time I was there was I got like

1446
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:31,903
legit

1447
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:36,800
explanation of things from Pete
because Pete and I were just like,

1448
01:35:36,801 --> 01:35:38,030
it's 10 o'clock at night.

1449
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:41,950
We've been working for eight days
straight and we're just in there getting,

1450
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:47,200
and I'm asking him pointed questions
about stuff about how this thing gets,

1451
01:35:47,961 --> 01:35:50,480
you know what I mean? Cause I
want to understand it. Yeah.

1452
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:54,260
There's a lot of those guys that
had to learn a lot of stuff.

1453
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:57,830
You can't even, it's, I think
it's been five years, six years,

1454
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:02,760
the amount of information that had
to be learned from nut, from no,

1455
01:36:02,761 --> 01:36:07,270
from nothing. From nothing. No. From
trial and error. It's a funny ass Pete.

1456
01:36:07,271 --> 01:36:10,900
That code and stuff like you
can't exhaust Pete who yeah,

1457
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:15,200
you see the twinkle in his eye. He wants
to explain it. He's all halls concerned.

1458
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:19,220
Those boring you guys with it. Oh Man.
Stay off to that for sure. But yeah,

1459
01:36:20,020 --> 01:36:24,900
origin g a hundred percent origin rask
guard 100% supplements too, by the way.

1460
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,580
And I wasn't not,
I wouldn't call myself anti supplement.

1461
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:31,820
And I'm going to say that, but I wasn't
into supplements that much before.

1462
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:32,713
Now I am.

1463
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:37,010
Because you know when you come
across the one that actually works,

1464
01:36:37,011 --> 01:36:40,550
that's the thing. You know,
plenty of people, there are
plenty supplements. It's,

1465
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:44,630
they sorta rely, maybe
not 100%, maybe 100%,

1466
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:46,700
but they rely on the placebo effect.

1467
01:36:47,810 --> 01:36:52,810
So when you have supplements
like these that actually work,

1468
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,400
you becoming supplement person.

1469
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,270
So if you want them got joint
warfare for your joints,

1470
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:04,190
obviously Krill oil for your life,
like leading your joints,

1471
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:08,570
joints in your just overall health
discipline for when you got to get that

1472
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:13,400
workout and there's discipline drink
and there's discipline. Go pills go,

1473
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:17,660
go. And then it was more, you hit
some kind of mock scenario going on.

1474
01:37:20,450 --> 01:37:24,140
Technically it was warrior kitten
monk's last night we go to,

1475
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:29,500
okay, there's this light show,
Christmas lights Shill, right.

1476
01:37:30,490 --> 01:37:33,440
Um, you know, the, you know,
certain neighborhoods they'll have,

1477
01:37:33,441 --> 01:37:36,840
I guess this one is like super
famous, like shoot tracers. No,

1478
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,750
no,
it's called the,

1479
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:45,160
I think Balardo I think it's called
Balardo light show. It's like, you know,

1480
01:37:45,260 --> 01:37:49,160
Christmas lights, this house, they do it
for thing. It has a whole show and people,

1481
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:53,410
you know, so we go and you know, my
wife, she likes the Christmas spirit.

1482
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:57,510
Get all cozy, right? It's kind of
colder now, California. Cool. Dig It.

1483
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:02,340
No offense, no offense.
Iowa, no friends. Main, yeah,

1484
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:06,060
no offense. But California cold,
we'll say you can see your breath.

1485
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:09,750
You're talking 40 49 degrees

1486
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:13,650
anyway,
so like in,

1487
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:17,040
in like Michigan or Minnesota.

1488
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:22,460
It's 54 below in Montana
it's 54 below zero.

1489
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:27,150
So anyways, continue a little
bit different. Sure. But still,

1490
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:31,200
but for the Charles Families Warrior
Little Chili or according to my wife at

1491
01:38:31,201 --> 01:38:34,140
warranted, maybe a hot chocolate scenario.
So look, this is what we're going to do,

1492
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,180
driver, it's kind of close
to miles who drive around.

1493
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:37,680
We're gonna look at all the nice lights.

1494
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:39,950
We'll drink our hot chocolate
and the car would bring the kids.

1495
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:43,920
It'd be fun if we can get out. So
everyone's busted out their hot chocolate.

1496
01:38:43,921 --> 01:38:46,940
Of course. What, what do you think my
hot chocolate was? Yeah. Oh, I know what.

1497
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:50,990
That's the warrior kid milk hot chocolate.
I even put some whipped cream on it.

1498
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,010
Oh yeah.
It was nice actually.

1499
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:57,340
It was surprisingly nice surprise.

1500
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,261
I was,

1501
01:38:58,261 --> 01:39:01,920
this is why usually I drink the regular
moke under different circumstances.

1502
01:39:01,921 --> 01:39:06,810
It's like boom, milkshake, but home, you
know. But you get the kid, consider this.

1503
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:11,130
Consider where I was. I had
two, two kids and one wife,

1504
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:15,630
all with regular hot chocolate. May or
may not have had marshmallows in it.

1505
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,840
Either way. Regular hot
chocolate and me I'm with, okay,

1506
01:39:18,841 --> 01:39:21,450
I'm going to stick with the protein
where your kids, so you didn't get,

1507
01:39:21,451 --> 01:39:24,750
your kids didn't have native
homie. That's, that's messed up.

1508
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:29,820
Here's the thing that to your kids,
yeah, I was younger, I was Gunna,

1509
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:34,410
but we're kinda in a hurry and I made
the game timeline. It was already made.

1510
01:39:34,411 --> 01:39:38,370
I'm not going to be like, hey, there's no
either way. Actually that's a good point.

1511
01:39:38,371 --> 01:39:42,090
Next time. 100% nonetheless, I
heat it up. It tastes the same.

1512
01:39:42,510 --> 01:39:46,080
Literally tastes. This is freaking
awesome. Same as regular hot chocolate.

1513
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:48,270
So anyways, that's warrior kid
mall. You've got strawberry.

1514
01:39:48,271 --> 01:39:53,220
And chocolate and then for, I had a guy
at the gym the other day and he was,

1515
01:39:53,221 --> 01:39:55,920
he's like, oh, I'm drinking
some milk right now. And I
was like, oh cool. I was like,

1516
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:59,190
anybody hadn't know,
like one of those metal water bottle,

1517
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:01,920
like a water bottle looking thing.
And I go, what did you mix it with?

1518
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:05,520
And he's like, water. And I go, Bro, you
got to, you got to get milk in there.

1519
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:09,840
And he goes, really? And I go, yeah,
I go almond milk, coconut milk,

1520
01:40:10,360 --> 01:40:14,250
one of the kinds of milks are
their almond milk. I said,

1521
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:17,970
just get some acid or whole milk,
just milk or skim milk, whatever.

1522
01:40:18,570 --> 01:40:22,540
I saw him yesterday. He
said, Bro, you're kidding.

1523
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:25,950
And I'm like, he was, no, I'm drinking it
all the time. And I know. Yeah, I know.

1524
01:40:26,150 --> 01:40:31,140
And he was actually telling me he liked
it just as is with water, which I can't,

1525
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:35,820
I can't, I'm not going to make that
claim because I don't believe it. Right.

1526
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:37,560
I'm not saying like, Hey,
if you drink with water,

1527
01:40:37,561 --> 01:40:40,000
it's going to be great or you drink
with waters. Okay. It's like, like I,

1528
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:42,630
like I said before, drink with
water. It's like a ham sandwich.

1529
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:46,680
If you drink it with milk, it's like
prime rib. Yeah, it's like a Ribeye.

1530
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:50,280
Sure. I didn't know what he
was doing. I didn't know.

1531
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:52,500
I didn't know his exact scenario
and I wasn't even there.

1532
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,620
I don't even know what
you're talking to him.

1533
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:58,420
He's used to like drinking protein
drink shakes in the shaker,

1534
01:40:58,421 --> 01:41:01,420
you know off the live mix them want
just throw it in with water or whatever.

1535
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:03,060
That's what he's forcing
it down. Yeah. Yeah.

1536
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,710
That's what he's used to open it with it.
Open your mouth,

1537
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:09,130
the ses gamma tube down your
esophagus to get your protein.

1538
01:41:09,131 --> 01:41:12,190
You don't need to do that with milk.
There's no forced feeding.

1539
01:41:12,220 --> 01:41:16,270
But that's what I'm saying. So now
he mixed it. Same deal. Same routine,

1540
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,980
but now we've got the mock tastes better.
Cool. Puts it in. Oh yeah, you're right.

1541
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:23,440
Where's Jocko? Let me find them. You
know, kind of thing. And you're like, Bro,

1542
01:41:23,441 --> 01:41:26,890
you're not even on the, you are
in the milk train fully. But man,

1543
01:41:26,891 --> 01:41:29,230
you could be up here in first class.
See what I'm saying?

1544
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:34,150
Rather than the in the caboose. Cool, man.

1545
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,193
Either way,

1546
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:39,970
just get on it and get all this stuff
or didn't mean.com also web store.

1547
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,160
We have a store,
Jocko,

1548
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:47,161
store.com this is where you can get
more rash guards for Jujitsu approved.

1549
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:52,240
By the way, 100% approved.
This is more, you know,

1550
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:57,070
representing the path directly
in those rash guards. Anyway,

1551
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:02,050
some good rash guards on their shirts,
shirts and hats, beanies, hoodies,

1552
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:05,350
legit hoodies and yeah,

1553
01:42:05,470 --> 01:42:09,220
go to [inaudible] dot com
you'll also Jocko white tea,

1554
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:13,600
which yes, he's at the,
funny enough my wife is,

1555
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:17,740
she's on this there. Jocko white tea
train. This is not, but if there was,

1556
01:42:17,741 --> 01:42:19,420
she would be the engineer.

1557
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:25,210
She'll even say I'm about to get after it.
Right before she did.

1558
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:30,070
I guess this is why you can't create
viral marketing, right? You can't be like,

1559
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:34,660
hey, let's come up with a viral
thing for Jocko white tea. Hey,

1560
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:39,640
get on the Jocko white tea train.
Like that doesn't work, I guess.

1561
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,470
Whereas most chain hundred percent
trains Shoulda just formulated itself.

1562
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:46,460
That's what I mean. Yeah, you're right.

1563
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:50,830
It preexisted in some universe
and then when it arrived here,

1564
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:52,460
it was like Choo Choo,
get on

1565
01:42:54,810 --> 01:42:59,320
a chuck anyway. Jocko white tea. Yes.

1566
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:01,630
Deadlift 8,000 pounds,
whatever.

1567
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:04,150
I've been dead lifting 8,000
pounds for a long time already.

1568
01:43:04,151 --> 01:43:07,240
So that is less exciting then
it's going to be for the,

1569
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,900
you know the people who just
start just saying, but yeah, sure.

1570
01:43:10,930 --> 01:43:14,950
Somebody asking you could dead lift 1600
pounds if he, if you drink two cans,

1571
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:19,660
now you just want to say this,
but uh, no, it doesn't work.

1572
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,760
That doesn't work that way. Yeah, no,
exactly right. Exactly right. Nonetheless,

1573
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:27,320
in Cannes and in, what
do you call it? Dry Tea.

1574
01:43:28,150 --> 01:43:31,480
Prefer the cans personally, but the
dry, it tastes good too. For sure.

1575

If you want to see what
a guest looks like,

1590
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:28,910
if you want to see the
look on [inaudible] face,

1591
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:33,860
when I say something that he doesn't
agree with or if you want to see the look

1592
01:44:33,861 --> 01:44:36,080
on my face when he says something,

1593
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:45,080
uh, that was one of the funniest
outtakes was you talking and then you,

1594
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:50,081
but you were just showing my face just
like so bored and annoyed and yes,

1595
01:44:50,690 --> 01:44:51,710
there is a few of those.

1596
01:44:51,711 --> 01:44:56,710
There's one where I was talking about
justifying like not doing squats or

1597
01:44:56,720 --> 01:44:58,060
whatever and you're just like this.

1598
01:45:00,010 --> 01:45:02,060
I thought the funny thing was
already you're talking about,

1599
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:06,200
so I'm going to an alien thing and I just
showed my face and I'm just looking at

1600
01:45:06,201 --> 01:45:10,820
me like, please get the hint that
my face right now means stop,

1601
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:15,260
but you are actually really nice
about that. I'm are generally nice,

1602
01:45:16,050 --> 01:45:17,420
pretty nice person.
Well,

1603
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:21,530
sometimes you take advantage of that
with stories that impinge on my whole

1604
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:25,940
situation anyway,
psychological warfare,

1605
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,390
which that's what that is by the way,
when you're just looking at me,

1606
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,720
nothing like that.
Just looking like it's psychological.

1607
01:45:32,721 --> 01:45:34,760
It's psychological communication.
Anyway,

1608
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:38,960
the real psychological warfare is an
album with tracks of Jocko on each track

1609
01:45:38,961 --> 01:45:41,060
telling you how to overcome
your moments of weakness.

1610
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:46,061
That may may creep in t your whole
scenario in life when you're on the path,

1611
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:51,050
you can get that on iTunes, Google
play, MP, three platforms or whatever.

1612
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:55,700
You know what I said we were going to
get psychological warfare to out by

1613
01:45:55,701 --> 01:45:58,310
Christmas, not going to
happen. Little delay.

1614
01:45:58,311 --> 01:46:01,310
If you still have some requests of a,

1615
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:05,810
of an area of weakness and you want us
to make a psychological warfare tracks

1616
01:46:05,811 --> 01:46:10,180
and you can crush and destroy that
weakness, then just let us know the uh,

1617
01:46:10,370 --> 01:46:15,170
you know, the usual means yes. Yeah.

1618
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:20,210
Online. Cool. Yeah. All your excuses are
lies by the way. That's the working title.

1619
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:24,080
Also very up your work though.
I was going to do a video today.

1620
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:27,790
We'll work up video of
yourself. Yup. Cool.

1621
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:33,380
And I was going to do a kettle
bell typical kettlebells
scenario and I was just

1622
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:35,470
going to start doing curls with it,
but,

1623
01:46:36,660 --> 01:46:40,400
but I decided against it because
it's kind of disrespectful to the,

1624
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:41,541
got a good idea.

1625
01:46:41,541 --> 01:46:46,541
You should do a workout video where you
just have a barbell Kettlebell Dumbbell,

1626
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:50,520
uh, uh, a sandbag and everything.

1627
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:54,210
You just don't girls
essentially the idea,

1628
01:46:54,211 --> 01:46:57,780
but it was kind of disrespectful.
Anyway, my point there being,

1629
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,650
what it reminded me of
of it is that the crow,

1630
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,960
it was going to be like really
good like produced video.

1631
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:07,080
Not necessarily with a good camera,
nothing like that, but just like,

1632
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:09,030
I'm just going to frame
it good and it was good.

1633
01:47:09,031 --> 01:47:13,350
It was going to be using the Onnit,
kettle bell, the cyclops, whatever.

1634
01:47:13,710 --> 01:47:16,650
Nonetheless decided against it because
it's going to be kind of disrespectful

1635
01:47:16,651 --> 01:47:18,660
because that's not what
kettle bells for obviously,

1636
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:23,040
but if you do get kettlebells, even if
it's funny, it's still disrespectful.

1637
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:25,740
I have to what it felt like at the
time, but no, you're probably right.

1638
01:47:26,580 --> 01:47:29,760
I the time I was like, yeah,
it'd be all right. Yes. Anyway,

1639
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:33,360
my point is even those little bit
beside the point, it reminded me of it.

1640
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:34,200
The point is,

1641
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:38,400
my new point is when you want to vary
up your workout curls or otherwise,

1642
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:41,560
some people, they don't even do
curls. I used to do curls. You see,

1643
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,610
do curls to don't act like you
know. No, I do. I do. Go, boom.

1644
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:48,870
Get your stuff from on [inaudible]
dot com slash Jocko by the way,

1645
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:50,310
kettle bells rings.

1646
01:47:50,311 --> 01:47:54,990
These are things that not only do I do
pretty much every workout pretty much,

1647
01:47:55,830 --> 01:48:00,060
but this is, these are ones that I
strongly recommend to incorporate rings.

1648
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:04,610
And this last stuff you can do on rings
by the way, the pushups pull ups and uh,

1649
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:08,810
the planks or whatever,
those big ups dips. Yeah.

1650
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:12,930
I don't do them as much, but the
planks for sure. You don't do dips?

1651
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:17,430
Not on the rings. No. Why?
I Dunno. I just don't. Okay,

1652
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:20,590
let's do them on the bar nonetheless.
Good job.

1653
01:48:20,620 --> 01:48:24,380
These are Dang Bro.
That was a lot of heat right there for,

1654
01:48:24,660 --> 01:48:28,170
for no dips on the rings anyway. Get
them out on it. Good stuff on there.

1655
01:48:28,171 --> 01:48:31,170
Very up to workout.
Incorporate new things in the workout.

1656
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,170
Yeah man,
it's good.

1657
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:38,470
Mikey and the dragons is out.

1658
01:48:38,860 --> 01:48:43,590
It is in stock fully.
I'm sorry that it took a little eight.

1659
01:48:43,630 --> 01:48:45,730
Everyone should have gotten it
by or should get it by Christmas.

1660
01:48:45,731 --> 01:48:50,470
If you ordered it reasonably before
Christmas, you should have it because we,

1661
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:54,520
we made it, we did it. Everyone that
ordered it, we got an Amazon fulfilled,

1662
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:58,660
so appreciate everyone that ordered it.
It is now fully in stock.

1663
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:03,060
We should not run out again family.
If you have Amazon prime,

1664
01:49:03,061 --> 01:49:07,630
that's like two days, right?
Yeah. I Dunno. I Dunno. Yeah.

1665
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:11,530
I Dunno when they're cut off time is
for Amazon to get it shipped in time.

1666
01:49:11,531 --> 01:49:12,380
But yeah.
Um,

1667
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:16,270
those are in the distribution centers
around the country with Amazon prime right

1668
01:49:16,271 --> 01:49:20,320
now. So if you haven't gotten Mikey in
the dragons for every kid that you know,

1669
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:22,870
then you can get it done right now.

1670
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:26,500
We got a lot of copies ready to roll.

1671
01:49:26,530 --> 01:49:30,880
So get it for your kids, get it for your
neighbor's kids, get it for your library,

1672
01:49:30,881 --> 01:49:31,680
whatever.

1673
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:34,960
You can also get the way of the warrior
kid books way the warrior kid and Mark's

1674
01:49:34,961 --> 01:49:39,760
mission. If you want your kids or kids,
you know, to actually have a good life,

1675
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:44,950
this is a great way to start them off
actually having a good life. Yes. Another,

1676
01:49:45,010 --> 01:49:48,040
this is a holiday gift.
If there ever one

1677
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,220
was one discipline equals freedom.
Feel better.

1678
01:49:50,260 --> 01:49:55,070
I need to post that video actually a
post that video repost. Oh yeah, yeah,

1679
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,940
yeah. Get that video posted. But yeah,

1680
01:49:57,941 --> 01:50:01,660
because that's a good gift to give to
anyone that needs to be on the pros in the

1681
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:05,470
morning. If you want to get the audio
version of that, it's not on audible,

1682
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:09,070
it's on iTunes, Amazon music,
Google play, et cetera.

1683
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:12,130
Extreme ownership of course,
dichotomy of leadership,

1684
01:50:12,910 --> 01:50:15,430
possibly better than extreme ownership.

1685
01:50:17,740 --> 01:50:22,120
I've gotten like four last four people
I talk to. I was like, ah, possibly.

1686
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:26,850
And they're like, no, it's
definitely better. And that's
kind of weird, right? Yes.

1687
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:31,330
Is that, yeah, well, [inaudible]
go flare up. You know what I mean?

1688
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:35,460
Maybe, but I don't really get that
from what you just said right now I,

1689
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:39,130
here's my hypothesis that people who were,
who were saying that dichotomy,

1690
01:50:39,131 --> 01:50:40,720
leadership is better
than extreme ownership,

1691
01:50:40,750 --> 01:50:44,950
better than extreme ownership or people
who read extreme ownership and then

1692
01:50:44,951 --> 01:50:47,950
we're like, yeah, you know, hell
yeah, I'm going to extreme ownership.

1693
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:50,710
And then they go in and they're
like, okay. It's like, you know,

1694
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,940
I made the analogy of the
guy on major league, right?

1695
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:59,350
The picture. He had all this power,
but he didn't have any control.

1696
01:50:59,740 --> 01:51:01,150
Dichotomy of leadership comes in,

1697
01:51:01,151 --> 01:51:04,010
gives them that control that
they wish that they had. Yeah.

1698
01:51:04,130 --> 01:51:06,340
They didn't even know they didn't have it.
They didn't know they didn't have it.

1699
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:08,280
They thought the extra
mile to a mile thing.

1700
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:13,560
A seal buddy of mine came over to my
house the other day and he brought 20

1701
01:51:14,801 --> 01:51:16,420
copies of extreme ownership.

1702
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:20,320
His wife wanted to give his,

1703
01:51:20,321 --> 01:51:25,321
giving them to her team in
the company and he goes,

1704
01:51:25,781 --> 01:51:27,960
yeah, you know, I'm giving, you know,
my wife really wants to give him,

1705
01:51:28,630 --> 01:51:31,930
and she's read it. She
loves it. And then he goes,

1706
01:51:31,931 --> 01:51:36,700
but she's kind of a bull in a China
shop. Yes. And I was like, okay,

1707
01:51:37,210 --> 01:51:39,070
cool. So I guess what
I did, I was like, Hey,

1708
01:51:39,071 --> 01:51:41,260
let me give a little something
for your wife's Christmas present,

1709
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:43,270
giving her a little Christmas present.
Yep.

1710
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:46,480
We have a little something called
dichotomy of leadership because that's the

1711
01:51:46,481 --> 01:51:48,550
situation you're talking about.
Oh, you know what though,

1712
01:51:48,551 --> 01:51:51,770
it's the perfect situation. Like you
think, oh, I'm going to go take ownership.

1713
01:51:52,150 --> 01:51:55,610
And it's like, well, or even like
everyone's going to read this book, it's,

1714
01:51:55,720 --> 01:52:00,490
I'm dichotomy of leadership.
Let's make sure we're balanced.
Yeah. Actually though,

1715
01:52:00,491 --> 01:52:02,620
you know what,
you know what I just thought of right now?

1716
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:06,610
I gotta I gotta take it back.
Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm right.

1717
01:52:06,611 --> 01:52:09,490
Maybe I'm not with that whole analogy.
But you know what though?

1718
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:12,160
What's more important?
Power or bow or, or,

1719
01:52:12,161 --> 01:52:16,180
or what do you call accuracy or whatever.
Right? Cause it's Kinda the same thing.

1720
01:52:16,181 --> 01:52:19,540
Extreme ownership is like, oh, here's what
you do. Full speed. This is what you do.

1721
01:52:19,870 --> 01:52:22,690
And then the dichotomy is kind of the
control element. What's more important?

1722
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:27,310
Control or speed. See what I'm saying?
Controller. [inaudible] controller.

1723
01:52:27,320 --> 01:52:30,190
They're both important. I think so too.
Yeah. At the end of the day, that's,

1724
01:52:30,191 --> 01:52:33,610
I think that's the scenario though.
You won't have,

1725
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:36,790
you won't have anything to balance if
you don't understand the fundamental

1726
01:52:36,791 --> 01:52:38,570
principles of combat leadership.
Right?

1727
01:52:38,571 --> 01:52:43,410
So you got to have the balance
and Justin's gotta be, yeah.

1728
01:52:43,450 --> 01:52:46,720
So get those books. Good
Christmas presents. Or

1729
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:54,240
I'm the worst gift giver. Eh, you're not
very good for you. Let me take that back.

1730
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:58,130
If I get you a gift, which is
not likely. Yeah, it'll be great,

1731
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:01,930
but it's a slim chance.
You're getting one. Well,

1732
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:05,050
how many gifts have you gotten
from me to what I give you?

1733
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:08,060
Well one actually a technical
I don't think was from you.

1734
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:13,060
You gave me a copy of the discipline
equals freedom field manual signed or like

1735
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:18,330
on your own. Like it wasn't like,
Hey, give me, you are like, hey,

1736
01:53:18,460 --> 01:53:22,610
you know this is for you. Go.
That was cool. What else? Nice.

1737
01:53:23,270 --> 01:53:26,930
That's cool. Cause I've written six
books. I'm giving you one. There you go.

1738
01:53:26,931 --> 01:53:31,040
You're batting or about average. Only
20% of the time. My daughter one. That's,

1739
01:53:31,060 --> 01:53:35,240
you're exactly right. Not me with
different, no, you gave me something.

1740
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:36,590
I think it was like a shirt or something.

1741
01:53:36,591 --> 01:53:39,410
Then I found out like later that
day that it wasn't from you.

1742
01:53:40,810 --> 01:53:45,770
You're just a message that was given to
you. One gift. Thanks for that by the way.

1743
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:49,100
Check. Ah, also we've
got an echelon front.

Interesting. How your we're
going to Australia. Yeah.

1756
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:37,270
Cause a lot of people were saying,
you know, if for some reason I didn't,

1757
01:54:37,271 --> 01:54:40,790
I went to Brisbane, Australia and
I did a book signing in Brisbane,

1758
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:44,930
Australia and I announced it on like
a Wednesday or a Thursday and the book

1759
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:48,830
signing was on Friday and I showed up
and there was hundreds and hundreds of

1760
01:54:48,831 --> 01:54:51,140
people there. Um, yeah,

1761
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:54,770
I was super stoked about that and it
showed that there was a lot of people that

1762
01:54:54,771 --> 01:54:58,160
we're supporting and of course
we've got e f Overwatch,

1763
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:03,370

from Spec ops and combat aviation

1764
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:07,850
communities with companies in the civilian
sector that need experienced leaders

1765
01:55:07,851 --> 01:55:12,170
to step up and lead inside
their organizations to go
to eff Overwatch and fill

1766
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:16,400
out the information there either as
a talent seeker or a career seeker.

1767
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:20,140
We're waiting to link you guys
up. You know, speaking of events,

1768
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:24,290

Q and a live I think.

1773
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:44,010
Or maybe I'll assemble questions from the

1774
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:47,700
group. Yeah, like the old
school, old school, half,
half, multiple, half and half.

1775
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:52,410
That's what we're going to do. Something
like that. Anyways, calendar yourself,

1776

to come hang out? Come and get some.

1778
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:03,090
We will see you there and if you
want to link up with us virtually,

1779
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:07,530
we are pretty readily
available on the interwebs,

1780
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:11,430
on Twitter,
on Instagram and on Facebook.

1781
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:17,840
Kibo hop echo is that Echo Charles and
I am at Jocko Willink and thanks to all

1782
01:56:18,961 --> 01:56:23,961
the military personnel out there that are
providing us with this way of life and

1783
01:56:24,301 --> 01:56:27,840
you can see how bad life can get

1784
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:34,690
when you read a book like
the Gulag Archipelago. Also,

1785
01:56:34,870 --> 01:56:37,840
thanks to police and law enforcement,
firefighters, paramedics,

1786
01:56:37,841 --> 01:56:42,070
EMT is correctional officer's border
patrol and all first responders have for

1787
01:56:42,071 --> 01:56:45,340
protecting this way of life
that we have here at home.

1788
01:56:46,930 --> 01:56:48,760
And to everyone else out there,

1789
01:56:48,761 --> 01:56:53,761
just remember that this nightmare of the
gulags started when people can't quiet

1790
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:58,540
on a large scale

1791
01:57:00,640 --> 01:57:02,470
and on a small scale.

1792
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:09,460
Don't let that happen on a large
scale and don't let it happen to you.

1793
01:57:10,760 --> 01:57:11,593
Okay?

1794
01:57:11,670 --> 01:57:15,720
Resist that whole opening
chapter about not resisting.

1795
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:19,680
Don't let that happen.
Resist, resist the weakness,

1796
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:21,420
resist the lies,

1797
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:26,600
resist the things in your life that
will turn you into a prisoner and into a

1798
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:28,823
slave.

1799
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:35,720
And you'd do that by
going out there every day

1800
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:39,510
and getting after it.

1801
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:41,473
Okay.

1802
01:57:41,610 --> 01:57:46,140
And until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

1803
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:47,690
out.
