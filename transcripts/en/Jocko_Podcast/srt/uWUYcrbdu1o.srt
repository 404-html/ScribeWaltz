1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,540
This is Jocko podcast number
66 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,330
Jocko Willink. Good
evening, Echo. Good. Even

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,370
at three 25 the true once again
received orders to attack.

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,520
I gave an order full of enthusiasm.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,570
I told the troop we attack and
five minutes to the 70 [inaudible].

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,920
This is the movement we have all awaited.

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,250
Although we knew the general
locations of large enemy units,

8
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,900
we had not received detailed intelligence
about the enemy we were to encounter.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,730
I had a feeling however,
that this time we would meet the enemy.

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,670
Lieutenant Gaultier known for his deadpan
sense of humor, asked on the radio,

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:52,170
what kind of contact can we expect?
I replied,

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,010
enemy contact. He said, Roger,

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,280
that's the best kind and the troop
rolled forward through the blowing sand

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,590
and that's a,

15
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,590
that's a little excerpt from a personal
account from a guy by the name of HR

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,660
McMaster.

17
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,660
You may have heard about recently
coming into a higher profile job in the

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,450
current administration.
But he's a very interesting guy.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,980
And I wanted to talk a little bit about
his experience in some of the things

20
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,950
that he said about this
is the way he sees things.

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,130
And so he was in this big battle
in the first Gulf war as a captain.

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,140
So you know,

23
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:45,141
in charge of a a group of 140 guys and
he fought in this battle called the

24
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,690
battle of 73 east.

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,480
And I'm gonna go to a little excerpt
from Wikipedia that sort of gives you the

26
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,540
broad idea of what was going on in the
battle of 73 eastern refers narrowly to

27
00:01:56,821 --> 00:02:01,680
the violent armored combat action that
took place in the final hours of second

28
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,710
acrs covering force operation in the zone
of Second Squadron and in the northern

29
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:12,651
third of the third squadron zone in
the battle for of second acrs armored

30
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,140
cavalry, cavalry troops, troops,

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,200
e g and I with troop k contributing
to I troops fight totaling about 36

32
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,200
[inaudible] tanks,
defeated two enemy brigades,

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,340
the 18th brigade. And later in
the day, the Ninth Armor Brigade.

34
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:37,050
So it's interesting you have a
legitimate tank battle, right?

35
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:40,620
Like a World War Two style tank battle
that took place in the first Gulf War.

36
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,760
And that's what this is talking about.

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,240
And McMaster at the time McMaster's
was in charge of eagle troop,

38
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,070
so they got some good details in here.
And again, this is a very simple,

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,870
one of the best,
clearest descriptions of what happened.

40
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:02,770
It was actually on Wikipedia, so I just
pulled some of that. So here we go.

41
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,110
A little bit of what Eagle troop did

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,720
at 4:10 PM Eagle true perceived fire
from an Iraqi infantry position in a

43
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,370
cluster of buildings.
Eagle troop,

44
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:18,780
Abrams and Bradley's returned fire,
silenced the Iraqi guns,

45
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,050
took prisoners and continued to east with
the two tank platoons leading the nine

46
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:29,100
m one tanks of Eagle troop
destroyed 28 Iraqi tanks,

47
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,930
16 personnel carriers,

48
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:35,931
and 30 trucks in 23 minutes
with no American losses.

49
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,660
So you've got nine tanks against 28
tanks and 16 personnel carriers and 30

50
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:48,340
trucks and the nine tanks.
When that's,

51
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,310
that's this domination,
battlefield domination.

52
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,850
And there was a bunch of technical
reasons as well as leadership reasons that

53
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,684
we're going to get into.

54
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Next at about four 20 eagle crest at a
low rise and surprised and Iraqi tent

55
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,880
company set up in a reverse
slope defense on the 70 easting.

56
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,010
Captain McMaster leading the attack
immediately engage that position,

57
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,190
destroying the first of the
eight enemy tanks to his front.

58
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,300
His two tank platoons finished the rest.
So they're just,

59
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,000
they're just hammering,

60
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,070
hammering these I Iraqi tanks
three kilometers to the east.

61
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:32,071
Mcmaster could see t 72 so those are
the tanks at the Iraqi's are using in

62
00:04:32,381 --> 00:04:35,830
prepared positions continuing
his attack past the limit,

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,820
the 70 limit of advanced. So the
way maps are set up, there's,

64
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,890
there's coordinates on them
and each one of the core does,

65
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:47,470
has each one of the lines that runs
north, south has a, has a label to it.

66
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,470
69707170270 three so he had been told
not to go past the 70 easting that's what

67
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,660
they're saying.
That was his limit of advanced.

68
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:57,670
These are all really common
military terms. They say, Hey,

69
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:01,750
you're not allowed to go past this
road or this, this coordinate on a map,

70
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:03,490
and they just call that
a limit of advance.

71
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,230
So he was supposed to stop at 70 he has
to get after it a little bit harder.

72
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,290
Continuing his attack past
the 70 limit of advanced,

73
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,770
he fought his way through an infantry
defensive position and on the high ground

74
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:19,771
along the 74 easting and this is going
now that I mix this in here with the

75
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:24,400
Wikipedia, which was a very simple
explanation of what happened.

76
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,110
Now going into a personal account that
McMaster wrote himself when he was a

77
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,130
young captain.

78
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,200
Okay,

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
so here we go.
From captain mcmasters account,

80
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,000
Lieutenant Gifford called me from the
command post to remind me that the 70

81
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:42,980
easting was the limit of advanced. We
were already beyond it. I told him,

82
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,820
I can't stop. We're still in
contact. Tell them I'm sorry.

83
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,450
Gifford explained the situation to the
squadron headquarters on the radio.

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,280
Major Mcgregor was forward with our
tanks and fully understood the situation.

85
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,780
If we had stopped,

86
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,430
we have forfeited the shock effect we had
inflicted on the enemy. Had we halted,

87
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,120
we would have given the enemy for
farther to the east and opportunity to

88
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:09,590
organize an effort against us while we
presented them with stationary targets.

89
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,430
We had the advantage and had
to finish the battle rapidly.

90
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,090
We would press the attack until all of
the enemy or destroyed or until they

91
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:19,994
surrendered.

92
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,200
So that's a pretty bold move to just
push and it's also a risky move.

93
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,440
And I'll say the biggest risk of it is
having a blue on blue situation unfold.

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,050
I think it makes a lot easier the fact
that this was day time and that that just

95
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:36,290
makes it, everything's so much
more clear in the daytime.

96
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,230
But you could obviously make
some mistakes if you're,

97
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,140
if you're pushing you that limited
advances there for a reason and you might

98
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,180
have some other group that's
controlling that sector.

99
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:47,570
You also might have air power that
the air power might be told, hey,

100
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:51,830
if you see any vehicles moving past 70
easting you can start dropping bombs.

101
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,480
So you do have to be very cautious when
you make an aggressive move like this.

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,090
And I bet McMaster himself
would go back and say,

103
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,190
you know what I should have done is I
should've given him a heads up. Hey,

104
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:04,310
I'm pushing past 70 easting please,
you know, let everybody know.

105
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,390
So now this is going back to the,
to the wiki account here.

106
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,540
There he encountered and destroyed
another tank unit of 18 t 70 twos in that

107
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:17,990
acts in the Iraqi stood their ground and
attempted to maneuver against the troop.

108
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,070
This was the first determined defense the
regimen had encountered and it's three

109
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,770
days of operations still.

110
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,610
The Iraqi troops had been surprised
because of the inclement weather and we're

111
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:32,750
quickly destroyed by the better trained
and better equipped American troops.

112
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,540
After defeating that force,

113
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,250
McMaster send a scout platoon
of two Bradleys north to
regain contact with troop

114
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,960
g and doing that,

115
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,170
the Scout Platoon encountered another
Iraqi tank position of 13 t 70 twos which

116
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,310
they destroyed with tow missiles.

117
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,830
So as these guys are just
everywhere, they find these, these,

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,410
these Iraqi tanks,
they're just crushing them.

119
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,260
And this is going back to
McMaster's account again.

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,840
I jumped on top of my tank to give the
crew room to cross load ammunition.

121
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:09,140
While I monitored the radio.
I surveyed the fires,

122
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:13,850
which the which surrounded the troop.
It seemed as if the action,

123
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:18,350
it only lasted seconds. I felt no
significant emotion during the battle.

124
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,020
I think I had simply been too busy.

125
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,200
I realized that I had not eaten all day.

126
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,380
I tore into an Mre package and devoured
a dinner of cold potatoes and ham.

127
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,320
I gulped down some water and the quick
infusion seemed to slow the flow of

128
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:41,090
adrenaline. So I thought that was
interesting. He was just doing his job,

129
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:45,020
you know, he wasn't getting
emotional and just getting it done.

130
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:49,550
And then the ceasefire comes
the next day and that's it.

131
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,360
The war's over like,
I mean this was the world.

132
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,470
The war was 72 hours and
the war's over and so

133
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,350
he kind of talks about
what he was thinking here.

134
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,370
Once they hear the cease fire
back to McMaster's account,

135
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,800
Eagle troop had taken no casualties.

136
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,370
I and other soldiers offer
prayers of thanks to God.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,220
We did not gloat over our victory.

138
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,570
We'd simply done our part and
liberating Kuwait from the treachery and

139
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,590
inhumanity of Saddam Hussein and
his Republican Guard. Henchman.

140
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,610
We surprised the enemy
on the 26th of February.

141
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,050
That surprise and the bold action
and teamwork of the troops soldiers

142
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:32,820
contributed to the route that is now
known as the battle of 73 easting.

143
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,530
In general, the Iraqi's were
unprepared for the United States army.

144
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,870
Americans are better trained and equipped.
The true decisive factor,

145
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:45,510
however,
was the American soldier.

146
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,350
He is the best at what he
does and absolutely dedicated
to serving his country.

147
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,120
Our soldiers were aggressive and battle
yet demonstrated great discipline and

148
00:09:57,121 --> 00:09:58,500
compassion for their enemy.

149
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,960
I am grateful that I had the opportunity
to serve with them in this action.

150
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,450
Captain Hr McMaster,

151
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,720
each troop two to ACR.

152
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,680
So, and I didn't go into too much
of a, I didn't go into it at all,

153
00:10:16,681 --> 00:10:19,260
but they took a lot of prisoners as well.
They weren't just killing everyone.

154
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,780
There was a lot of people that were
surrounding a lot of Iraqi soldiers that

155
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,870
were surrendering and they were doing
their best to take care of those guys.

156
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:28,770
And there are also some that pretended
to surrender and then attacked.

157
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,570
So they had a little bit of both
and they, they as, as McMaster said,

158
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:37,710
they showed great discipline and
compassion for the enemy. Now I didn't,

159
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,641
you can,

160
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:42,960
you can go online and you can read the
full account of what this whole battle

161
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,310
felt like. But he, he recently wrote,

162
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,130
so now he's a lieutenant who
was a captain at the time,

163
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,890
an o three and now he's
a lieutenant general,

164
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,970
a three star and there's a a website
called the strategy bridge.org and there's

165
00:11:00,931 --> 00:11:05,931
an article there which is written by
McMaster and he goes through the lessons

166
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,670
that he learned in that
battle. And the, the,

167
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:17,210
the article is called something
along the lines of Hey,

168
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,600
guidance for small unit leaders.
So I thought there were some,

169
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,780
some good solid lessons learned that
he brought back. So I'm gonna go,

170
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,970
go through it.
Number one,

171
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,140
lead from the front leaders must be
forward to gain a clear picture and make

172
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:41,550
decisions. As Sergeant Harris engaged
with 25 millimeter lieutenant,

173
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:46,260
got ta moved forward to assess and
further develop the situation. So,

174
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:50,970
so to explain that you've got a sergeant
that's like engaging the enemy and then

175
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,770
the lieutenant,
he doesn't just sit there,

176
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,260
he goes forward to find out what's
going on and assess what's happening.

177
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,820
So as a leader, when your
troops are getting busy doing
the work, what can you do?

178
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,421
Don't get this.

179
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:04,300
Don't get target fixated on your own
guys and the work that they're doing.

180
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,170
Look around, go forward. Move to a
different position where you can see more.

181
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:11,880
Back to the book,

182
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Go ta fired a tow missile into the center
of the enemy position in the village

183
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:19,800
to Orient our tanks.
After our gunner,

184
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,330
Staff Sergeant Craig Kotch fired a
subsequent tank round to mark center.

185
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,560
All nine tanks fired high explosive rounds
into the village simultaneously just

186
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:32,550
suppressed the enemy position despite the
secondary explosions in the village to

187
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:37,110
itself. First platoon maintained
its primary observation to the east.

188
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,620
So he's basically marking their position.

189
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,940
Lieutenant go ta basically
marks the position.

190
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,543
Okay,

191
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,940
so not only did he move and
observe what was happening,

192
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,700
then he's directing.
Everyone else wants it once he does that.

193
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,420
So it's a really simple combat. You hear
it all the time. Lead from the front.

194
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,160
Now can you get too far forward?
Yes, you absolutely can. If you're,

195
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,270
if you're the guy that's actually
engaging the enemy and you're having a,

196
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,030
you know, either with your
weapon in a tank or your weapon,

197
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:10,510
your personal weapon on eight your your
your rifle and you're the leader and

198
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:12,150
you're actually shooting bad guys,
well then you,

199
00:13:12,151 --> 00:13:14,680
you got some issues because
you need to be looking around.

200
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,740
You need to be seen what the next move
is going to be. So lead from the front,

201
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,390
but always the dichotomy is there.

202
00:13:19,391 --> 00:13:23,170
Don't go so far forward that you lose
the ability to look around and observe

203
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:26,720
what's, what's happening. Number two,

204
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,120
shoot first

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,690
if you know we're friendly forces are
and there is not a danger of civilian

206
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:38,950
casualties, do not hesitate to shoot
or conduct reconnaissance by fire.

207
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,520
The side that shoots first
has a tremendous advantage.

208
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:46,930
Staff Sergeant David Lawrence was the
commander of first platoon's northern most

209
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:51,550
Bradley when his gunner,
Sergeant Bradley Feltman's said,

210
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,440
Hey, I've got a hot spot out there. I'm
not sure what it is. Lawrence responded,

211
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,730
put a toe in it, see what it
is. A toe is a tow missile.

212
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,750
Lawrence identified the hot spot as a t
72 as the term was ripped from its hall.

213
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,530
In the ensuing explosion,

214
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,570
our troops experience was consistent
with Erwin Rommel's observation in his

215
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:17,050
world war one book, infantry
attacks. And this is Rommel talking.

216
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,740
I have found again and
again in encounter actions,

217
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,060
any counteractions the day goes to
the side that is first to plaster its

218
00:14:25,061 --> 00:14:26,200
opponents with fire.

219
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,030
Okay

220
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:32,230
shoot first and how do I translate
that? Real simple, be aggressive.

221
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:37,150
Now he points out very clearly here,
you know where there's,

222
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,420
where you know where friendly
forces are. Yeah. Right.

223
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:44,770
You know we're friendly forces are because
obviously that can go sideways and by

224
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:49,240
the way,
when he pushed past his limit of advanced,

225
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:53,300
now also no one knew where he was. So
he need to be careful in that situation.

226
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,810
But that that aggressive being aggressive
with fire is something you have to do

227
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,230
and you can see like they saw
hotspot out there on their thermal,

228
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,990
I don't know what this is. We
have put a toner, which is,

229
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,900
we know it's not good guys.
Okay. Blasted. Yeah. We had a,

230
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,450
I had been in Baghdad on my
first deployment for like
a couple days and we went

231
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:22,100
out on a, on an operation in any
ways. When we were coming back,

232
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,240
we got ambushed and wasn't a big deal,
but like w you know,

233
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,550
we received fire and so
we returned fire and,

234
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:33,551
and basically we returned fire heavily
in and we were getting after it.

235
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,230
This is when we didn't have any armor
on her home. These, they were just,

236
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,860
they were just open, they didn't have
doors. So we didn't have armored Humvees.

237
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,250
Not many people did in Iraq at that time
in 2003 so what we had done is we had

238
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,470
taken the doors completely off and then
we'd taken our seats and turned them so

239
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,880
they faced outwards. So we, and we,

240
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,170
we'd have our feet like hanging out of
the Humvee or maybe sitting on these,

241
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,520
these big rails that we built along the
side. And so we'd be facing out. It was,

242
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:07,100
you were in a position, you were basically
in a position to shoot at all times.

243
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,090
And because of the way a Humvee set up
with doors on either side and then people

244
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:14,780
in the back,
you had 360 degrees of,

245
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:20,290
of visibility and of fields of
fire coming out of every Humvee.

246
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,080
And so when we got, we were
driving, we were on that,

247
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:25,700
we'd just done a little operation.

248
00:16:25,701 --> 00:16:28,880
We were coming back and as we were
coming back, we started taking fire.

249
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:32,000
And so we just returned fired.
It was a massive return of fire.

250
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:36,020
Like I think the enemy was
pretty overwhelmed with it.

251
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:40,520
And we got back and everyone was
kind of like, well we kind of,

252
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,750
we kind of laid it down.

253
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,570
We went through a lot of rounds
in a very short period of time.

254
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,040
And the reason I'm saying this story
is because that was my platoon.

255
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,870
And so we get back and,

256
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,700
and we're kind of debriefing and then
the next day we're going out in another

257
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:59,480
operation. And I don't know if the
story is going to make any sense,

258
00:16:59,481 --> 00:17:03,080
but the next day we were going out on
another operation and one of my Bros who

259
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:06,590
wasn't, who is my senior
enlisted advisor at the time,

260
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:11,750
but he wasn't on that mission that we
just did and he's, he goes, listen,

261
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,550
if you guys take contact,
you need to shoot back. You
can't be afraid to fire it.

262
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:19,090
And I made some combat like, don't worry,
we'll be good to go in the one on one,

263
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,030
here's afraid to shoot.

264
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,720
Then everyone laughed because they
knew that we put down a lot of lead.

265
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,900
If you want to, if you want to trade
bullets with us, we'll play that game.

266
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,310
We don't mind trading some bullets.
So the same thing though,

267
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,500
if you start feeling like you're
going to get contacted and then they,

268
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,610
that's another thing they just teach us,
you know, when you're in a firefight,

269
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,700
where do you think the enemy might be?
And we heard this a lot.

270
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:43,520
The Korean marines were talking,
or the the marines.

271
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,470
The US marines that were in Korea.
We were talking about that, hey,

272
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,010
you're going to put fire down where we
think the enemy might be cause that's

273
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,380
where you know you're looking at a
an area and there's a a good covered

274
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:55,410
physician. If there's a bad
guy it's probably going to
be there. Put fire on him.

275
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,910
Yeah.
Shoot.

276
00:17:56,911 --> 00:18:01,500
First lesson number two from
general McMaster. All right.

277
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,334
Number three,

278
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,750
fight through the fog of battle.

279
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,070
Be prepared for confusion and concurrent
activity as we suppressed enemy

280
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,100
positions in the village.
While Lawrence was launching a missile,

281
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,520
the troop received permission
to advance to the 70 easting.

282
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,980
I instructed first platoon to resume to
resume movement to the east lieutenant

283
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:30,120
pest check did not respond immediately
because Lawrence was reporting on the

284
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:33,960
platoon, radio net
contact, contact east tank.

285
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,810
Simple orders and complete reports
are essential to maintaining common

286
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,580
understanding in battle.

287
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,110
So there's another example of got to
keep things simple and he's specifically

288
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:53,361
talking about how you communicate
with other people on the radio.

289
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,230
That's what he's talking about.

290
00:18:55,410 --> 00:19:00,240
You have to communicate simply and
clearly in order for people to understand

291
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:03,990
what's happening. That can mean if you
give Troy, a lot of times you see this,

292
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:07,050
people try and give too much detail,
right?

293
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,640
That listen to this contact
contact east tank. That's it.

294
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,450
Where's the contact? It's to the east.
What is it? It's a tank. That's it.

295
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,510
That's what we need to know. Now everybody
knows it's going on. If you said, hey,

296
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,430
I've got a contact, he's about
480 meters. It is a t 72 tank.

297
00:19:23,431 --> 00:19:26,070
It's moving in an eastward. No, we
don't care about any of that right now.

298
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,610
We don't care about any of that.
Just tell us what is happening.

299
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,840
And that's one of the things that can
help you fight through the fog of battle.

300
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:38,190
Now that contact called is actually
a standard operating procedure,

301
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,030
I'm assuming, which is we, cause
we would do this in the seal teams.

302
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,750
You'd give what type of contact it is,
what direction or sorry,

303
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:48,820
what bearing and what distance.
So you'd say machine gun,

304
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,970
fire hundred and 50 meters,

305
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,410
four o'clock and now everybody gets
a very quick read of what's happening

306
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,900
because you can't, not everyone's
gonna see where the firing came from.

307
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,200
So even having a standard
operating procedure to keep your,

308
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,050
your verbiage limited is important.

309
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,010
There's calls the whole,

310
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,700
all everything we do in the seal teams
basically has a very simple call that you

311
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:15,780
can make and it's broken
down into like three words.

312
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,890
Contact Front online, you know,
that's it. Everyone knows what to do.

313
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,820
Every seal you tell them contact
front online, they know what to do.

314
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,680
Number four,
follow your instincts and intuition.

315
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,160
As Sergeant Feltman
launched the tow missile,

316
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:40,310
I decided to go to a tanks lead formation
and instructed green and white the

317
00:20:40,801 --> 00:20:43,200
tank platoons to follow my move.

318
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,640
First platoon pulled in behind as the
tank wedge moved and covered the tanks.

319
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:52,360
Rear Third Platoon,
retain responsibility for flank security.

320
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,650
Gotta maintain that flank security.
As we began moving forward,

321
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,510
first platoon responding to the contact
report on their platoon radio net began

322
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,900
firing 25 millimeter high explosive
munitions across the front.

323
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,590
It was a little unnerving for the tanks.
As we moved forwards,

324
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,700
I gave first platoon a
cease fire order red one.

325
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:14,710
This is black sex cease fire.

326
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,370
The two tank platoons were slightly
delayed as our tank came over the crest of

327
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:24,850
the imperceptible rise north of
the village Sergeant Craig Kotch,

328
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,700
the gunner reported tanks direct front,

329
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,750
I counted eight t 70 twos and in prepared
positions they were at close range and

330
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:35,740
visible to the naked eye.

331
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,430
So east talking about trusting
your instincts and trusting
your intuition and my,

332
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,510
and that's what he's doing here.
He's seeing things happening,

333
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,820
he's seeing things unfold and he's like,
he says, Hey, go go into this formation.

334
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:51,130
Boom. Everyone goes into his
formation. He's acting off of instinct.

335
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,340
But what's important here is where
do your instinct and where does your

336
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:57,310
intuition come from?
It comes from training and experience.

337
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,240
That's where it comes from. Now, it
could be hard to get combat experience.

338
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,190
We hadn't had a tank battle in,
well since World War II,

339
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,950
there's been no major tank battles
and here these guys are, no,

340
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:11,560
none of these people ever been in a tank
battle before and now they're in a tank

341
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,440
battle. So how do you do that? You got
to do realistic simulated training.

342
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:18,460
That's what you have to do and
you have to make this realistic.

343
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,530
It's gotta be surprising. It's all
the things I talk about all the time.

344
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,210
It's gotta be surprising.
It's got to be an unknown.

345
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:24,220
You've got to do things that
people aren't expecting.

346
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,140
That's what you have to do so that they
can develop their instincts so they can

347
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,700
develop their intuition.

348
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,420
Because if you're inexperienced and you
don't know what you're doing and you

349
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:37,420
just decide you're going to follow your
instinct, your instinct can be wrong.

350
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,020
It can be wrong. And the law,
it's like Jujitsu, right?

351
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,700
You take a new person in Jujitsu, their
instincts are going to be wrong. Period.

352
00:22:45,701 --> 00:22:48,430
End of story, right? I mean, the
classic is it someone is mounted on you.

353
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,950
Then they knew. Yeah. You
either do one of two things.

354
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,150
You try and push them off of you, you're
getting are locked or you turn around,

355
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:59,650
you turn over and they're choking you.
But each one of your instincts is wrong.

356
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,450
Your instinct needs to be elbow
scape or you know, uh, Oompah escape.

357
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,130
Got To be one of those two things.

358
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,390
But those are instincts
only come from training.

359
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,000
And it's the same thing
with these combat scenarios.

360
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:11,640
How you ha you can't just try,

361
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,260
don't just trust your instinct
as a matter of fact. Yeah.

362
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,870
Make sure you've trained yourself,

363
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,900
make sure you've prepared yourself
and then make sure that you detach.

364
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,080
Cause that's another thing that can screw
up your instincts is your instincts.

365
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,890
You're feeling pain. You know, I
was rolling with Andy yesterday.

366
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,020
He will put like pain on me.
He'll,

367
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,030
he'll put his elbow in my ear or something
and all he's trying to do is get me

368
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:41,050
to,
to make the instinctual move of all,

369
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,590
I'm going to greet you up and pull his
hand away if I do that I'm getting are

370
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,270
mocked, right. No. Can't do that. You
have to just accept the pain. Yep. Just,

371
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,920
just deal with it. Go grind
harder, Andy, bring it here.

372
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,890
Your instinct, if you start taking
fire from a certain position,

373
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,800
that could your instinct to be, oh, we're
going to get down and move over here.

374
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,490
You got to remember you've got to
detach enough that you say, oh,

375
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,330
I need to check my flank.
I need to see what else is going on here.

376
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,010
I need to assess these other situations
that might be unfolding. Yeah, that's the,

377
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,180
and that's where that kind of,

378
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:15,540
well I am training you come in and a lot
of it can be things that aren't really

379
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:22,130
conscious to and it comes with like let's
say, you know, relationship situation.

380
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:22,901
Let's say,

381
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:26,090
I know I'm sitting over here trying to
talk about war fighting and you want to

382
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:29,660
go straight to relationship to this
earlier in the show when not even

383
00:24:29,661 --> 00:24:31,970
necessarily saying, you know,
romantic or boyfriend, girlfriend,

384
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,120
any kind of relations.
If you know the person really well,

385
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,090
you can tell when something's off
just a little bit and be like,

386
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:41,240
hey something buddy. The guy would be
like, oh no, no, all good. And they can,

387
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:44,590
you know, they can be real
convincing with, yeah, yeah,
no, I'm all good, but you,

388
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,900
you know your instinct because you have
so much experience with them, you know?

389
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,810
Yes, you're right. And you're
right in the fact that, you know,

390
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:54,950
when I talk about deescalation,
right? If you come in and you say,

391
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,750
Hey Jocko, this crap, what we were
doing this, if my instinct is like, no,

392
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:03,050
it's not crap, that's my instinctive
response. Like, no, screw you. I'm right.

393
00:25:03,051 --> 00:25:07,550
You're wrong. But what I really need
to do is say, hold on a second. Detach.

394
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,880
Let's assess what Echo Sierra echo
normally doesn't do this. Right?

395
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,000
Why is he doing this?
Something is going on. Don't,

396
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,060
I'm not going to trust my instinct
right now. Luckily, like you said,

397
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,790
through training, through
knowledge, right? In this situation,

398
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:23,810
I know that you don't act that
way. So yes, follow your instincts,

399
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,590
follow your intuition, but make sure
that you've trained to develop them.

400
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,460
And also I like to question
him when I feel something,

401
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,880
I just don't go with it immediately.
I want to go with it.

402
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:38,420
And I most likely will go with it,
but there's also a possibility. I say,

403
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,140
well not a possibility, but what as I say,
hey, we need to move. Here I go, okay,

404
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,500
what could be happening? Is this a
position that the enemy might be in?

405
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,570
Is this a a move that could be getting set
up on me? No, I think I'm pretty solid.

406
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,640
Or at least as I move there,
I'm going to be aware of it.

407
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:56,350
I'm trusting my instinct, but
I'm being cautious. Yeah. Yeah.

408
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,330
It's crazy how like you
hear that talking police,

409
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:01,660
you know like cops have
like good in for sure.

410
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,410
The repetitious patterns. Sure.
Of Bad guys. Yeah, for sure.

411
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,860
I was going to say something else too.
Oh,

412
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:15,280
there's plenty of times where if you
don't trust your instinct you will get

413
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,890
crushed. Right? I mean you think
about in a Jujitsu perspective,

414
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,470
but when you get good, you're
not thinking about anything. You,

415
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:25,010
you have to just use your
instinct, your, you're training,

416
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,790
your muscle memory is what's working.
And the same thing with police. You know,

417
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:32,330
they get to a point of you going into a
situation and if they're not going off

418
00:26:32,331 --> 00:26:35,340
their instinct, they're gonna get,
they're gonna get burned. Yeah.

419
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,960
Cause they learned, you know? Yeah.
And that's the trained instinct.

420
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:43,770
How you were saying they train as opposed
to the untrained in kind of get a one

421
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:47,430
being a, being a police officer out
on the beat. You're not going to have,

422
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,180
they're not going to have an a fraction
of what you deal with that cop 10 years

423
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:55,440
later. Yeah. And you and that
cops, hey listen, I see your hand,

424
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,440
I see you got some blood on your knuckles.
I know what happened here.

425
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,790
Tell me what's going on.
You know what I mean?

426
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,750
Whereas a young guy might be old
school in your face about softer. Yeah.

427
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:07,590
Or guys like being too nice.
You know how like the cop can tell like,

428
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:09,920
oh this guy's being tuned ice.
Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah.

429
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,710
There's like a mediocre level of niceness
that's like, okay, that seems like,

430
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,731
like he's mellow,

431
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:18,180
but if a guy's being like too
aggressive or too defensive or too nice,

432
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:21,100
they can tell you. I know there's
something I'm suspicious, you know? Yeah.

433
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,240
He'd be a new that might not be able to
tell that. You know what I mean? Yeah, no,

434
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:28,350
absolutely. All right. Next one.

435
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,280
Number five,

436
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,050
use standard unit fire and battle drills.

437
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,070
Aim to overwhelm the enemy upon contact
and retain the initiative through speed

438
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:41,094
of action.

439
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,780
As sergeant catch fire the main
gun and destroyed the first tank,

440
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:50,820
I sent a contact report to the troop.
This is black. Six contact east,

441
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,880
eight armored vehicles,
green and white. You with me?

442
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,360
Sergeant conch destroyed two
more tanks as our tank platoons,

443
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:58,320
accelerated movement.

444
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,010
All nine tanks began engaging together
as we advanced in approximately one

445
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:08,610
minute. Everything in the range
of our guns was in flames.

446
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Fire distribution and control allowed us
to destroy a much larger enemy force in

447
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:19,690
a very short period of time.
So how do they do that?

448
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,790
Good solid, disciplined,
standard operating procedures.

449
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,680
And you, I'm telling you, you, you
think about how simple this is. He says,

450
00:28:29,681 --> 00:28:33,160
this is black six contact east
eight armored vehicles or green.

451
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,560
Why are you with me?
That's the whole,

452
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,570
that's the whole detailed plan.
Hey, there's bad guys over there.

453
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,830
We're moving east, let's go.
And everybody says, all right,

454
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:48,700
we've done this thousands of times.
We've drilled it, we rehearsed it. What?

455
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:49,630
What do we do right now?

456
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,080
And they probably had little standard
operating procedures. Hey guys, on the,

457
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:53,621
you know,

458
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:56,470
on the left flank are going to start
flying at the left vehicles of guys on the

459
00:28:56,471 --> 00:28:56,951
right flank.

460
00:28:56,951 --> 00:29:01,930
And they had all these procedures work
out so that in less than a minute victory,

461
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,390
less than a minute. So develop those
good standard operating procedures,

462
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,220
disciplined procedures. And when I
talk about freedom on the battlefield,

463
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,020
this is exactly what I'm talking about.

464
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,840
Discipline equals freedom on the
battlefield because when you have those

465
00:29:16,841 --> 00:29:20,050
discipline procedures, he doesn't even
have to see it. The freedom to maneuver.

466
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:23,350
He has a freedom just to say,
hey guys, there's the enemy.
Let's take care of them.

467
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:28,010
Boom. It's done. Yeah. Next one.

468
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,150
Number six foster initiative.

469
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,610
Every trooper understood how our
platoons and the troop conducted fire and

470
00:29:37,611 --> 00:29:40,010
maneuver our tank driver,

471
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,180
special ed specialist Christopher Heden.

472
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:48,181
Sog knew that he had to steer a path
that permitted both tank platoons to get

473
00:29:48,461 --> 00:29:49,690
their guns into the fight.

474
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,250
He turned 45 degrees to the right and
kept our frontal armor towards the first

475
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,640
enemy tanks we engaged,
he drove through a minefield,

476
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,060
avoided the anti tank mines
reporting on the intercom. Sir,

477
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:03,520
I need you to know we just
went through a minefield.

478
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,970
He knew that it would be dangerous to
stop right in the middle of the enemy kill

479
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:07,804
zone.

480
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:13,030
Heden Skog saw that our tank platoons
had a window of opportunity to shock the

481
00:30:13,031 --> 00:30:16,570
enemy and take advantage of the first
blows that Sergeant Kotch delivered.

482
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,890
So clearly this is decentralized command,
right?

483
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,480
And you just think about this first.

484
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:26,830
Every trooper understood how our platoons
and the troop conducted fire maneuver.

485
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:31,840
Everybody knows what to do.
Everybody. And here's this kid,

486
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,430
he's probably 18 years old. Is he
a specialist? Yeah, specialists.

487
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,340
He'd probably 19 years old and
he's got he leaving, right?

488
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,510
The commander's in charge.

489
00:30:40,511 --> 00:30:43,740
But there's the guy that's driving that's
picking the course where they're going

490
00:30:43,741 --> 00:30:47,500
to go. And again, think
about this, the captain,

491
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:51,600
he's not saying like 86 degrees, the
left six degrees to the right, get 40 no,

492
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,760
he's not giving any of those orders.
And if you think about it,

493
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,640
could he have been able to do that?
He's dealing with all this other stuff.

494
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:00,130
You're dealing with fire
control. He's dealing with, uh,

495
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,760
the position he's reporting
back up the cheese,

496
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,800
got all this other stuff going on.

497
00:31:02,801 --> 00:31:05,440
He doesn't have time to
tell this guy where to go,

498
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,270
but it's decentralized command.

499
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,450
That specialist that is leading the
tanks from an actual driving perspective.

500
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,430
He knows what to do.
He knows the procedures,

501
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,340
and so he's able just to do it.
He even knows,

502
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:24,370
he knows it so well that when he
sees that we're in a minefield,

503
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:29,020
he assesses the threat. Okay, we're
in a minefield by c three minds.

504
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,530
I'm going to steer around them the best
I can, but if we stop, we're going to be,

505
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,970
we're going to be open to getting
attacked by the enemy. So you know,

506
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:36,940
we're gonna do,
we're gonna keep moving.

507
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,180
And he made that decision on
his own of the right decision.

508
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,690
He made that decision on his own because
he understood the overall objective and

509
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:49,270
the procedures that they would
follow and what was most important.

510
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:52,480
So that's a great example
of decentralized command.

511
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,523
Number seven,

512
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,120
use tanks to take the brunt of the battle
tanks drove around the anti tank mines

513
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:08,710
and Bradley's and other vehicles
followed in their tracks.

514
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,200
Our squadrons s three tank commanded
by major Douglas Macarthur.

515
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:18,970
Mcgregor hit an anti tank mines but the
blast damage to the tank only slightly.

516
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,030
It continued the attack and made a repair.
When we halted,

517
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,460
we ran over anti personnel mines,

518
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:29,580
but they sounded like pop
microwave popcorn popping
and had no effect on armored

519
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:30,544
vehicles.

520
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,820
The rate of our fire of our tanks allowed
enemy tanks to fire only to aerate

521
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:44,300
main gun rounds at the outset of the
battle and to later as the troop assaulted

522
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,410
enemy machine gun fire had no
effect on the troops advance.

523
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,980
The psychological shock of our tanks
advancing undaunted toward their defensive

524
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:57,350
positions paralyzed and panicked.
The enemy.

525
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,460
So if you don't know anything
about what I'm talking about,

526
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,120
I apologize.
But tanks are massive.

527
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:11,750
A one Abrams tanks are massive and
they have extremely heavy armor.

528
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,720
They're 68 tons. And as
he's saying here, these,

529
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:19,100
even the anti tank mines aren't,
aren't,

530
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:23,560
aren't stopping the tanks and the,

531
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,280
the Pr Anti-personnel just has nothing
but Bradlees are smaller, not as big,

532
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,630
not as big and not as heavily armored.
So the,

533
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,330
the tanks are laying down,
you know,

534
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,940
driving and then the Bradlees are just
falling in their tracks in case they hit

535
00:33:37,941 --> 00:33:40,880
any minds the,
they would hit the Abrams tank.

536
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,830
But what I said when I take about, so
how can we apply this to, you know,

537
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,900
everyday life,
how can we apply this to business?

538
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,520
You know the saying technically
specifically use tanks
to take the brunt of the

539
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:54,020
battle, right? This,

540
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:59,021
this is the way I look at this from a
business perspective and from a life

541
00:33:59,031 --> 00:34:03,920
perspective,
play to your strengths,

542
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:04,730
right?

543
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:08,090
What is the strongest thing they've got
are these tanks and it's the same thing

544
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,280
that we run into in business,

545
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:13,670
and it's the same thing you run
into in life and Jujitsu everywhere.

546
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,500
What are you, what are you strong
at? What are your strong areas?

547
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:21,320
And that's what you focus on. That's
what you use to lead your, your advanced.

548
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:25,550
Now, do we train for our
weaknesses? Absolutely. You know,

549
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:28,700
we do that all the time. Do we? Do we,
when we have a weakness in a business,

550
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,100
we don't go, hey, let's
just cover this up. No, we,

551
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,770
we focus on it so that we can prove it,

552
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:36,950
but if we're going to go
to market with something,

553
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:41,390
let's go to market with something that
we're good at, right? If we're gonna,

554
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,670
if we're going to try and set up
some expansion into a new area,

555
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,810
let sucks set up the expansion into
an area area that we're familiar with,

556
00:34:50,811 --> 00:34:53,570
that we're good at, that we're
strong in. Let's not say, Hey,

557
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:54,680
you know what we've been making,

558
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,880
we've been making cars
for the last 50 years.

559
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:02,630
Let's go over here and make computers.
No, we're going to make cars. Okay,

560
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:07,520
let's make trucks too. We know how to
build vehicles. That's what I'm saying is,

561
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,370
and you see this all the time, would
you do to, what do Jujitsu guys do?

562
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:15,410
What they should do, which is try
and try and play to your strengths,

563
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,490
right? Yeah. In in competition.
Competition. Yeah. Right.
Of course, when we're,

564
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,650
when we're training, we prayed our
weaknesses, right? We want to, Oh, I'm,

565
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,970
I don't like people being across side.
Cool. Let him get across side. Yeah.

566
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,340
I don't like being on the bottom.
Cool. I'm going to be on the bottom.

567
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,300
But in competition,

568
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,580
what are you good at and how do you
get the person to play your game? Yeah.

569
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,240
That's the question. And that's
everything too, right? Like even at work,

570
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,660
you're going to train the new guys,
but you're not going to send the new guy,

571
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,860
you know, to make contact with a
potential client or something. Be Quiet.

572
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,300
Don't send the new guy.

573
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:52,950
Send the strongest and the tank and the
m one Abrams to meet the new client.

574
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,430
That's got big potential.
So play to your strengths.

575
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:01,800
Use tanks to take the brunt of the battle.
Next,

576
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,120
be prepared for misfires
and degraded operations.

577
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,260
Lieutenant Jeff Desantos tank
crew came around the village,

578
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,970
destroyed an enemy tank and acquired a
second tank at very close range that was

579
00:36:17,971 --> 00:36:20,400
traversing on them around.

580
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:24,180
Got Stuck in the breach of the cannon,
meaning this,

581
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,770
this can is not going to shoot anymore.

582
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,050
The loader grabbed hold of the loaders
hatch kicked around in the breach,

583
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:35,970
came up and the Gunner Sergeant Matthew
Clark destroyed the t 72 in another

584
00:36:35,971 --> 00:36:36,804
example,

585
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,320
staff sergeant Digby ordered Private First
Class Charles Brewer Toobin to reload

586
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:45,180
tow missiles per tubing.

587
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,450
Could not get the cargo hatch open.
However,

588
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:52,590
when the lightweight wrestler
guys a wrestler, good for him,

589
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,410
kick the hatch release.
He sheared it off.

590
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,550
Rather than tell Bradley his Bradley
commander that he could not get the toes

591
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,300
reloaded,

592
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,810
he jumped out of the back door while the
vehicle is under small arms and machine

593
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,500
gunfire. He climbed onto the back of
the Bradley, loaded both missiles,

594
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,130
then tap the his Bradley commander on
the shoulder while yelling toes are up.

595
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,720
Staff Sergeant Digby nearly jumped out
of his skin because he thought an Iraqi

596
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:16,920
had climbed onto the Bradley.

597
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,240
So here's these little malfunctions going
on with your weapons and what do you

598
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,600
do?
You deal with it,

599
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,680
and I think I said this on
the last podcast with life,

600
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,050
we have a little saying nothing
works. Everything sucks, right?

601
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,360
And that's what you got to prepare for.
You count.

602
00:37:36,361 --> 00:37:39,300
If you rely 100% on those radios,
those radios aren't going to work.

603
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:43,830
If you rely 100% on your weapon,
okay, you better learn those drills.

604
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:48,540
You better learn how to, how to fix
and adjust your weapon very quickly.

605
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:51,330
Go to your secondary, whatever the case
may be, you've got to drill those things.

606
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:55,320
Got to be ready for problems. You gotta
be ready for Murphy's law to kick in

607
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,400
next.
Number nine,

608
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,040
coordinate between platoons
and ensure mutual support.

609
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:10,020
The burning tanks and personnel carriers
of the enemy's first defensive line

610
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:15,021
formed a curtain of smoke that concealed
enemy further to the east as our tanks

611
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:17,700
assaulted through the smoke,
we saw other enemy,

612
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:21,750
armored vehicles and large numbers of
infantry running to get back to subsequent

613
00:38:21,751 --> 00:38:23,100
trench lines and positions.

614
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,140
We destroy the enemy armored vehicles
quickly and shop the infantry with machine

615
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:30,210
guns.
As we closed the distance with them,

616
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:35,500
pockets of enemy soldiers threw up their
arms are soldiers were disciplined.

617
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:40,830
Turrets turned away from any enemy
soldier with his hands raised tank platoon

618
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:47,410
leaders asked a scalpel tunes to pick
up observation of the enemy infantry as

619
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:49,120
their Bradley's came through the smoke,

620
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,430
the scouts saw that the enemy had used
a false surrender to gain a better

621
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:55,264
position.

622
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,970
Enemy soldiers were re shouldering the
rifles and rocket propelled grenades are

623
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:05,290
Bradley's surprised the enemy and killed
them before they can engage our tanks

624
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,440
effectively covered move,

625
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,140
cover move real simple.

626
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,250
That's what that one
is mutually supporting.

627
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,890
That means we're helping each other out.
That's what cover move is

628
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,640
next.
Number 10

629
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:28,410
take risk to win because
eagle true press the assault,

630
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,090
the enemy could not respond effectively,
right?

631
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:36,550
That's that.
You're going to find that in 80 case.

632
00:39:36,551 --> 00:39:37,870
You want to get the person on their heels.

633
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:39,550
You want to get your
opponent on their heels.

634
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,670
As we cleared the western most defensive
positions, our executive officer,

635
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,980
Lieutenant John Gifford,
broken on the radio.

636
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,190
I know you don't want
to know this right now,

637
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,930
but you are at the limit of advance.
You are at the 70 easting. I responded,

638
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,070
tell them we can't stop.

639
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:59,290
Tell them where to contact and
we have to continue to attack.

640
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:03,460
Tell them I'm sorry we and
that's a part I already covered.

641
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:08,670
We had surprised and shocked the enemy
stopping would have allowed them to

642
00:40:10,211 --> 00:40:14,560
recover. As Erwin Rommel
observed an infantry attacks,

643
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,040
the man who lies low and
awaits developments usually
comes off second best.

644
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,730
It is fundamentally wrong to Holt or to
wait for more forces to come up and take

645
00:40:28,031 --> 00:40:29,230
part in the action.

646
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:36,170
Eagle troop continued to attack toward
another very subtle ridgeline on the

647
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:40,280
enemy position on which the
enemy position his reserve,

648
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,700
a coil of 18 t 72 techs,

649
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:47,030
major Mohammed later
told one of our troopers,

650
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:48,920
this is the enemy commander of this unit.

651
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,050
Major Mohammed later told
one of our troopers that he
had not known he was under

652
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,980
attack until a soldier ran into his
elaborate command, bunker yelling tanks,

653
00:40:57,981 --> 00:40:58,814
tanks.

654
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,500
By the time he got to his observation
post all the vehicles in defensive

655
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:06,030
positions to the West,
we're in flames.

656
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:11,330
He ordered the reserve behind him to
establish a second defensive line.

657
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,160
It was too late.

658
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:17,870
The Eagle troops tank crested the
rise and entered their assembly area.

659
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,180
The tanks were starting to move out
when we destroyed them at close range.

660
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,800
So it's not only take risk,
it's to be aggressive.

661
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,140
That's gotta be your default mode.

662
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,250
Default mode is aggressive
press attack and it,

663
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:38,180
it's interesting when,
I mean clearly it happens in combat.

664
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,440
You start getting the upper
hand, keep going, keep going.

665
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,290
And it happens in Jujitsu as well.
You know,

666
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:48,620
if you can get that person on the run,
you're attacking them with two, three,

667
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,450
four different things at the same time.

668
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:53,300
That's when they're done and
that's a bad feeling when you're,

669
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,440
when that's happening to you,

670
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,950
you're falling behind in the Ooda
loop and they're just getting,

671
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,330
getting all inside your loop.

672
00:41:59,331 --> 00:42:02,270
You're defending something that you
feel the other thing happening. Yeah,

673
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:07,220
not good, but again, take risk. But yes,

674
00:42:07,221 --> 00:42:11,080
be aggressive.
Now those word,

675
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:15,170
the lessons from this,
this one battle,

676
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,520
you know this one battle
at 73 easting and now

677
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,840
obviously McMaster stayed in the army.

678
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,970
He went up through the
chain of command and,

679
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:31,030
and now we're going to go to 2005 2006
the battle of [inaudible] in Iraq,

680
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,560
which this,

681
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:40,070
this battle was led by who
is now our kernel McMaster.

682
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:42,980
He was a captain at the time
of this 73 easting battle.

683
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:45,710
Now he's a commander who's
commanding the third ACR,

684
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:49,550
the Third Armored Cavalry Regiment,
and

685
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:55,640
this is very similar to
the battle of Ramadi.

686
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,520
What happened in
California and the reason,

687
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:02,600
one of the reasons why it's so
similar is that Colonel Macfarlane,

688
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,720
who was the commander of the one
one d that led the fight in Ramadi,

689
00:43:08,121 --> 00:43:09,470
that I was there to support.

690
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,580
The first thing he did
when he went back to Iraq,

691
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:18,581
when when Mcfarland went back to Iraq
for that deployment in 2006 he took over

692
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:24,161
for a McMaster and McMaster was in
tallow far so mcfarlane shows up and

693
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,090
[inaudible] and says, Hey, this is what I
did. I did a little something called cs,

694
00:43:29,091 --> 00:43:30,920
clear hold and build.
This is the strategy.

695
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,130
We pushed into these NV
controlled territories and,

696
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:41,110
and then it becomes so pacified in Talla
far that they were able to take most of

697
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:47,150
the one one 80 and send them down to
Ramadi. And when they got down to Ramadi,

698
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:52,070
Mcfarland, who's a brilliant guy, had
listened to everything McMaster said,

699
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,540
looked at how he did it, and then
applied the same strategy in Ramadi.

700
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:59,390
Now he had to make adjustments to it for
sure because it wasn't exactly the same.

701
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,890
But luckily he was a smart
creative guy that said, oh,

702
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:03,290
we've got to make these adjustments.
But he did it.

703
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,920
But the overall concept came from what
McMahon from what McMaster did up in

704
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,194
Taliph are.

705
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,470
And so there was an article in the New
Yorker written by a guy named George

706
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:19,730
Packer.

707
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,730
And the article is called the lesson
of tallow far is it too late for the

708
00:44:25,191 --> 00:44:29,690
administration to correct
its course in Iraq? And this,

709
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,720
this article came out April 10th,
2006,

710
00:44:33,721 --> 00:44:38,721
probably three or four days before
I arrived in Ramadi in 2006.

711
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,460
So that's when this article came out
and you can see he's saying, hey look,

712
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:48,360
is it too late to correct
the course will actually, um,

713
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,860
a lot of people in 2016
weren't even admitting that
we were on the wrong course.

714
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,790
You know, cause what we're doing at that
time, and I've talked about this a bunch,

715
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:02,120
what America had been doing at that time
is his going out grabbing bad guys one

716
00:45:04,531 --> 00:45:07,470
at a time, two at a time and bringing
them back to base and putting them,

717
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:09,450
arresting them, capture, kill missions.

718
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,680
And what's interesting is that's that's,

719
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,400
that's an attrition, that's
a war of attrition, right?

720
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,800
You have certain number of bad guys,
we're going to go catch them all.

721
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,590
And he really wasn't working.
It really wasn't working.

722
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:29,610
That's why in 2005 2006 enemy
attacks were up 300% and you know,

723
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,470
2005 2006 our whole country,
well I shouldn't say our whole country,

724
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:35,610
but many people in our country,

725
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:40,611
including a lot of major politicians were
saying it was unwinnable and you know,

726
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:43,140
we, we just need to get out and it
was a quagmire and all that stuff.

727
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:48,141
So that's because we were
not on the right strategy.

728
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:53,400
And actually if you take this and
you apply it back to Hackworth,

729
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:58,140
when he basically said during the end
of the Vietnam War and he said, look,

730
00:45:58,141 --> 00:46:01,440
we're not going to win. He wasn't talking
about we couldn't, when he was saying,

731
00:46:01,441 --> 00:46:03,390
we're,
we're fighting the wrong kinds of tactics.

732
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,990
We're doing the wrong thing here. You
keep saying, Hey, what's our body count?

733
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,500
What's our body count? What's our body
count? That's a war of attrition. Hey,

734
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,530
we lost this many guys. You lost that
many. That's an attrition warfare.

735
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,460
It's World War One. I always use World
War One is the classic attrition warfare.

736
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:19,250
Hey, we're going to go over the trench.
We're to kill as many of you is.

737
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,150
You can and hopefully it's
less than, well, awesome.

738
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,140
We're going to see you can last longer.
That's a punchy. That's, that's, hey echo.

739
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,750
We're just going to stand here. You
Punch me, I'll punch you. You Punch me.

740
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,960
And whoever goes down, you
know loses. Well, guess what?

741
00:46:30,961 --> 00:46:34,530
What do we look like at the end of that?
We're all beat up her, right? Both of us.

742
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,420
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter how good we are.

743
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,860
So these guys were thinking maybe
instead of doing punches to the face,

744
00:46:40,861 --> 00:46:43,540
we should do little Jujitsu, a
little something, a little bit more,

745
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,330
more tactically sound.

746
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,590
And it wasn't just go out,
grab bad guys,

747
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,650
just go out and try and kill bad guys
because we learned 2003 2004 2005 that's

748
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,940
three years of doing those type of
operations and real progress wasn't being

749
00:46:59,941 --> 00:47:03,540
made. It's certainly wasn't made.
And in Ramadi at this point, again,

750
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,930
there was guys that were doing incredible
work and you do have to go out and,

751
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:11,910
and attack the bad guys and go
after those critical notes for sure.

752
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,570
But we were focused so much on that that
we were at ignoring a lot of what was

753
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:18,660
happening with the populace
and politically other,

754
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,700
other areas that needed to be addressed.

755
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,590
So this article came out,
and again,

756
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:30,591
it's from the New Yorker written by George
Packer came out 10th 2006 and here's

757
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,150
what we're going to this
article back to the article.

758
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,680
The lesson that McMaster and his soldiers
applied in Talla far were learned

759
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:41,800
during the first two years of
an increasingly unpopular war.

760
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,300
When we came to Iraq,
we didn't understand the complexity,

761
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,100
what it meant for a society to live
under brutal dictatorship with ethnic and

762
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:52,480
sectarian divisions.

763
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,190
Yeah.

764
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,600
He said in his course, energetic
voice. When we first got here,

765
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,460
we made a lot of mistakes.

766
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,210
We were like a blind man
trying to do the right thing,

767
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:08,140
but breaking a lot of things later.
He said,

768
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,500
you gotta come in with your ears open.

769
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:16,900
You can't come in and start talking.
You really have to listen to people.

770
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,960
I mean, okay. That is just,

771
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,880
this whole thing is just a,

772
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:27,910
a great summary of a humble
man, right? He's saying, look,

773
00:48:27,911 --> 00:48:31,600
when we came here, we didn't understand
the complexity. That's humility. He says,

774
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:34,420
we didn't understand what it was like
to live under brutal dictatorship.

775
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,010
That's humble. He says, when we first
got here, we made a lot of mistakes.

776
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,720
He's not saying all, we did everything
right. No, we made a lot of mistakes.

777
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,170
We were like a blind man
trying to do the right thing,

778
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,650
but breaking a lot of things. So they're
trying, he admits it. We're trying,

779
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,210
but we're breaking a lot of stuff
later. He said, listen this,

780
00:48:55,211 --> 00:49:00,190
you gotta come in with your ears open.
You can't come in and start talking. Okay.

781
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:03,220
Leaders around the world pay
attention to that right there.

782
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,620
You don't need to come
in and start talking,

783
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:08,740
come in with your ears open and listen.
And he says,

784
00:49:08,741 --> 00:49:10,840
you really have to listen to people.

785
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:14,830
Okay,

786
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,650
very clear. Very great
leadership guidance right there.

787
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,320
Back to the article.

788
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:21,463
Yeah.

789
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,260
They didn't even want to say the I word.

790
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,740
One officer told me it was
the specter of Vietnam.

791
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,800
They did not want to say the insurgency
word because the next word you say is

792
00:49:32,961 --> 00:49:33,794
quagmire.

793
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:39,790
The next thing you say is the
only war America has lost Vietnam.

794
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:45,830
And the next thing you conclude is that
certain people's division of war is

795
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:50,630
wrong. So we had a hard time again,

796
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:54,290
just as America admitting,
Hey,

797
00:49:54,291 --> 00:49:56,210
this isn't just a bunch
of thugs running around.

798
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,960
There's an organized insurgency here.
We needed fight it like an insurgency.

799
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:03,560
We had a hard time making that
mental transition as a nation.

800
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,860
And I'll tell you when I,
I've told this story before,

801
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,870
when I got to Ramadi and I
looked at what was going on,

802
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:14,230
I literally read the counterinsurgency
manual that was written by basically by

803
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:19,130
General Petraeus who's a brilliant
guy. And these guys, McMaster,

804
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,510
I think macfarlane, they all helped him
write that article or write that book.

805
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,310
So this was a totally different attitude.
And you know,

806
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:30,170
you hear it here that people,

807
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:34,790
people back in d c they didn't even
want to use the word insurgency.

808
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,470
They want to use that word because it,

809
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,300
it makes everyone think
of nom and we lost,

810
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,583
right?

811
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:49,520
So the article, I'm going going
a little bit deeper on that,

812
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:55,040
back to the article, the Pentagon
strategy in 2003 and 2004 was to capture,

813
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:59,960
was to combat the insurgency simply
by eliminating insurgence and approach

814
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:04,640
called Kill capture.
[inaudible] SAP,

815
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,390
a retired special forces officer who
now teaches at the naval postgraduate

816
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:12,920
school in Monterey, California. Set of
the method. It's all about hunting people.

817
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,440
I think it comes directly
from the secretary of defense.
I want heads on a plate,

818
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,670
so he's talking about Rumsfeld right
there. You'll get some people that way,

819
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,530
but the failure of that approach
is evident. They get Hussein,

820
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:32,270
they get his sons, they continue
to work every week to kill more,

821
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:36,710
capture more. They've got facilities
full of thousands of detainees,

822
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:42,340
yet there's more than surgeons than there
were when we started in dereliction of

823
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:43,850
duty.

824
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:48,850
Mcmaster wrote that a strategy of
attrition was in essence the absence of a

825
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:55,910
strategy one a great line.
That is right and so,

826
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:00,800
so McMaster wrote a very harsh critique
of the Vietnam War and the way it was

827
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:02,450
run. Again, not,

828
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,870
not a critique of the boots on the
ground and the troops that fought,

829
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:09,170
but a critique of those back
in BC that were running it.

830
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,660
And you know,
this is just,

831
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:16,900
this is just an incredible statement
that a war of attrition is in essence the

832
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:21,730
absence of strategy. This is
like, okay, what do you do?
What do, I'm just going to,

833
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,810
we'll go kill as many of us and
we can't. Okay. That's if the,

834
00:52:25,811 --> 00:52:29,510
if that's your strategy, not a strategy.
It's like when you get new an MMA fight,

835
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:31,130
what's your strategy?
And the guy goes,

836
00:52:32,030 --> 00:52:35,330
I'm going to punch him in the face until
I win. Right? That's not a strategy.

837
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,960
Put My head down. And definitely a
good strategy. Don't, don't do that.

838
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,220
You need to have a little bit
more strategy than that. Yeah.

839
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,760
Um, back to the article. If we're
not stupid and we don't quit,

840
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:53,800
we can win this thing. And again,
what's important is the 2006, this,

841
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:56,840
this major McCaughlin Maclaughlin,

842
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,950
he's another person that's interviewed
in this article. He's talking about like,

843
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:04,880
we could lose this thing, right? So
if we're not stupid and we don't quit,

844
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:07,970
we can win this thing.
Major, Major mclauchlan said,

845
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,480
history teaches you that war at
its heart is a human endeavor.

846
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:18,470
And if you ignore the human side,
yours,

847
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,870
the enemies and the civilians,
you set yourself up for failure.

848
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,290
It's not about weapons,
it's about people.

849
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,990
That's very, it's very true. And
I'll tell you where it's true.

850
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,570
It's true in war, clearly.
And it's true in business too.

851
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,840
And you get people that don't
understand the human side of business.

852
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:50,820
They don't understand that they're
dealing with human beings and they treat

853
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:53,640
people like numbers.
They're not going to be successful.

854
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:58,170
Now you also get people that go
so far in the other direction,

855
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,480
that's all they care about is
their people. And guess what?

856
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,060
Now they're making bad business decisions
and they're hiring more people and

857
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:03,481
they're keeping them.

858
00:54:03,481 --> 00:54:05,520
They're not letting anyone go and
they're running themselves in the ground

859
00:54:05,521 --> 00:54:07,680
because their overhead's too
much and they caused destruction.

860
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,900
But on the other side, you've got someone
that's now bean counter, right? Nope.

861
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:18,310
You let that person go no severance or
whatever limited you do that methodology,

862
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:21,690
you're gonna end up with no business
either because they've people there.

863
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,360
Because there are people,
if you treat them like robots,

864
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,150
they're not going to work for you.
They're going to,

865
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:30,870
they're going to rebel against you.
The robot will do what the robot is told,

866
00:54:30,871 --> 00:54:31,920
but people aren't robots.

867
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,290
So you got to remember that human
side and obviously in war and that's,

868
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:40,140
that's one of the reasons that we're able,

869
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,960
if we're able to talk about
this stuff to businesses,

870
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,490
we're able to talk about combat
leadership to businesses. The first,

871
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,571
oftentimes,

872
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:53,340
the first thing that the business that's
bringing us on has to get a grip on is

873
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:57,270
the fact that we were in charge of people,

874
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:02,040
not terminator robots, right? We Lafe
and I use that term all the time,

875
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,860
that people think, oh, you're in the
military. Oh, you run a navy seals.

876
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,190
They do whenever you, no, no,
not true. There are people,

877
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,950
and guess what?
The enemy are people,

878
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:19,140
they have thoughts, they have passions,
they have desires, and guess what?

879
00:55:19,141 --> 00:55:22,410
The civilian populace that
you're working amongst,

880
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,360
those are human beings too,

881
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,230
and they're not just going to listen
to what you say and you can't just for

882
00:55:28,231 --> 00:55:31,590
instance, can't just throw
money out them, right?

883
00:55:31,591 --> 00:55:34,840
You can't just throw money at them.
They don't care about that money. You,

884
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,410
you know, it was really
interesting. I talked about this,

885
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:42,480
this new story I saw on vice
news of a guy going into,

886
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:46,530
he was, uh, I don't remember
the reporter's name, but
he's a young reporter,

887
00:55:46,531 --> 00:55:48,730
spoke Arabic and he goes into Ramadi wall.

888
00:55:48,731 --> 00:55:53,580
It was surrounded by Isis and Isis
was getting ready to take over.

889
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,330
And he's saying, Hey, he's
talking to just normal people.

890
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,690
And he's talking to this one guy. And
he says, you know, the guy saying, look,

891
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:05,160
we really need help. We hope America
comes back. And the reporter says, well,

892
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:08,700
why don't you just leave? You don't want
you to get out of here. And the guy says,

893
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,780
I live here. I live here.
I'm not going anywhere.

894
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:17,130
That's a human right. That's a
human, that's a sentimental value.

895
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:20,850
It's like my house that I live in,
you're not going to take my house from me.

896
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:25,360
Like if you, if people came to try
and take my house away from me,

897
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:28,790
there'd be a fight.
[inaudible]

898
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:34,510
it wouldn't end well for anybody.
No, that's sentimental, right?

899
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:39,020
So you have to remember that these human
beings are human beings. And that's the,

900
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,420
one of the key things that,

901
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,030
that McMaster really
mcmasters really understood,

902
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,840
really understood this
fact. And, and you know,

903
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:53,050
I'm giving a lot of credit to
McMaster, but there, there's a lot of,

904
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,890
I mean there's way more guys that I'm
talking about that I don't have them going

905
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:57,790
through their names,

906
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:02,970
but there's a lot of guys that contributed
to this idea and did an outstanding

907
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:06,820
job. Um, you know, he's getting the
credit because he's gotten charged, right?

908
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,190
I'm giving him some credit
because he's the guy in charge.

909
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:12,840
But I guarantee if you asked
him, he'd say, well, no, I
had this captain that this,

910
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,550
and I had this major that did that.
And he had all these people,

911
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,390
but he's the guy just like if something's
gone wrong, he'd be responsible.

912
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:22,270
We'll some stuff went right. So you
get the credit. They're general.

913
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,660
Now he wrote these,

914
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:32,140
these four fallacies of warfare,
which I find very,

915
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:33,520
very interesting.

916
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:39,660
And so we learned kind of the tactical
side of what he learned from his battle.

917
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:43,810
The 73 he stings easting. You
know, he had 10 lessons learned.

918
00:57:43,811 --> 00:57:45,190
Pretty tactical stuff.
Right?

919
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,950
Now we're getting into a little
bit more strategic level.

920
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,720
We're talking about war as
a broad in a broad sense.

921
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:56,890
And so here's what he says about
these four fallacies of war warfare.

922
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,120
There are four fallacies about future
war that are preventing us from learning

923
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,540
from our most recent experiences.
Mcmaster said,

924
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:10,050
these fallacies are portrayed in such
a way that they reduce risk to United

925
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:10,840
States interest,

926
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,840
when in fact they exacerbate risk because
they over rely on capabilities and

927
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:22,381
they purposely ignore
continuity's in the nature of war.

928
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,940
Okay? So he's saying, look, the,

929
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:29,950
the way they portray these things is
it makes everything good for America,

930
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,080
but they actually make
things worse for America.

931
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,173
Hmm.

932
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:38,490
Because they ignore things in
war that are always the same.

933
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,560
This is war we're talking about.
The nature of war does not change.

934
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:45,720
Okay?
His first fallacy,

935
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,400
okay?

936
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,020
The vampire fallacy,

937
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,530
it's a vampire fallacy.

938
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:56,790
It's a vampire because you can't kill
it and it comes back every 10 years.

939
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:02,640
This is the belief that a narrow range
of technological capabilities we'll

940
00:59:02,641 --> 00:59:06,780
deliver fast, cheap, and
efficient victory in future war.

941
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:12,240
The latest manifestation is the
belief in a new range of technological

942
00:59:12,241 --> 00:59:13,074
capabilities.

943
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:17,490
Everything from big data analytics to
artificial intelligence to drones and

944
00:59:17,491 --> 00:59:22,010
robotics and so forth. So,
so what does that mean?

945
00:59:22,011 --> 00:59:25,340
We have an idea that we can,
as a,

946
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,020
as a nation just we are,

947
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,290
we're so technologically advanced that
nothing can stand up to us and we can

948
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:34,280
just use these precision weapons
to take out enemy targets.

949
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:39,890
And then it's over. It's a fallacy.
It's a vampire. It's going to come back.

950
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,410
You can't just kill it.
It's gonna come back.

951
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:47,330
And you know, obviously we've
seen, we saw that in Iraq.

952
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:49,760
We had all kinds of technological
advances over the enemy,

953
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:51,623
but

954
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,610
they continued to come back.
And when we walked away,

955
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,040
they came back strong.
They were called Isis.

956
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:03,690
Now I think that's pretty self
evident what that means now.

957
01:00:03,691 --> 01:00:08,010
What does this mean in business
and in, in, in life? Well, to me

958
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,260
what this means is
there's no easy solution.

959
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:18,540
There's no easy solution to things,
right? We look at something, we go, oh,

960
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:20,010
we can just do this.

961
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,920
We can just use some new technology
or we can just use some APP,

962
01:00:29,810 --> 01:00:32,930
right? Oh, if I get an
APP to track my diet,

963
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,780
then I'll be good to go.
No,

964
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:39,590
you've got to stop putting the sugar
in your mouth to be good to go.

965
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,270
People want the shortcut.

966
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,960
They want to, they think that there's
an easy way to get things done.

967
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:55,820
And there's not. You have to do the
work. There's a vampire out there.

968
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:01,070
What you got to do is you
got to grab that vampire.

969
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:05,360
You gotta cut its head off.
You got to soak it in holy water,

970
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:06,560
and then you got to dry.

971
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:10,310
It's bones out in the sun that that's
what kills a vampire. All right?

972
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,440
That's the attitude you have to take.

973
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:15,200
You can't just think there's going
to be a shortcut. We'll be able to,

974
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:19,510
we'll be through with this of empire.
You know, tomorrow, cause I have a, uh,

975
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:24,260
a cool gun. I'm gonna shoot him. No
bullets. Don't kill him. Got to go harder.

976
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,420
Yeah.
I think the

977
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:31,080
correct, the way to kill a vampire
isn't to cut his head off. It's the,

978
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:33,840
it's the wooden stake into the heart.
That's,

979
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,990
I think you might be thinking I'm
going to do so or something. Okay.

980
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:40,920
Just kind of Fyi. The holy water
part with correcto. Yeah. Just,

981
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:44,310
just so Fyi, I don't, I don't
mean to call you out here.

982
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:49,530
I actually googled how to kill
a vampire that's wrong though.

983
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:53,580
Mythologies. It says otherwise he,
you stick a wooden stake in his heart.

984
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:58,590
Crucifix. We'll get them. If you
have faith, sunlight will kill him.

985
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,330
So that was correct. Holy
Water. Holy Water. We'll get
a murmur. Sure. Yeah. And um,

986
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,940
yeah, yeah. I Dunno what, what
website said? Cut his head off. Uh Oh.

987
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:12,270
Don't trust Google lesson learned.
See, you know what I did right there.

988
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,020
Took a shortcut. Oh yeah. I
took, I thought it was a vampire.

989
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,780
Just Google it real quick. We're going to
go, you know what you did. This is what,

990
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:21,480
this is what I think you did. I
think you googled it, which is fine,

991
01:02:21,481 --> 01:02:24,870
but here's the thing about googling
something. Googling is not the answer.

992
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:27,120
It's what you find from Google.

993
01:02:27,121 --> 01:02:29,960
And if you just go for the first
one or the one that looks like,

994
01:02:29,961 --> 01:02:31,500
because most people see the Iraq.

995
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:34,830
The irony here is that I tried
to take a shortcut and I'm wrong,

996
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:39,590
and that's the same. That's the
vampire fallacy in its own right.

997
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:42,430
Proves the point. All right, next,

998
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:48,190
the zero dark 30 fallacy.
And that's the name of a movie about the,

999
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,220
the killing of bin Laden.

1000
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:55,780
This is the idea,
the zero dark 30 fallacy.

1001
01:02:55,781 --> 01:03:00,781
This is the idea that all
you have to gain to do,

1002
01:03:00,851 --> 01:03:05,620
to gain a victory in war is to gain
visibility of an enemy's network structure

1003
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:08,590
and then conduct raids
against that network,

1004
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:13,360
either with special
operations forces or notes.

1005
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,190
So the problem with both these fallacies,
of course,

1006
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,490
they represent important
capabilities you need to have,

1007
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,760
but these are capabilities that masquerade
as strategies and simple solutions to

1008
01:03:27,251 --> 01:03:31,990
the complex problem of war,
neglecting wars, political nature,

1009
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:35,530
neglecting wars, human
nature, neglecting wars,

1010
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:38,980
inherit uncertainty based
on the interactive nature.

1011
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:44,910
And finally neglecting that it
is ultimately a contest of wills.

1012
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:54,490
So the idea that you can,
again,

1013
01:03:54,491 --> 01:03:56,530
it's attrition warfare and I,
I'll be honest with you,

1014
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:59,530
I never really looked at this as
attrition warfare until I was reading

1015
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:02,770
researching for this podcast. I
never, I always said, hey, you know,

1016
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:06,700
it's raid mentality. Hey, we can just
capture all the bad guys. But to say, yes,

1017
01:04:06,701 --> 01:04:10,750
that's attrition warfare. That's exactly
what it is. And especially for me,

1018
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:14,680
because I look at World
War One as so awful,

1019
01:04:14,681 --> 01:04:17,230
and it's an example of attrition warfare,
and that's what makes it so bad.

1020
01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:21,940
This is attrition warfare to, Hey, we're
just gonna capture, kill all the bad guys.

1021
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:26,530
How do you do that? What we're
forgetting is the, what about this line?

1022
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:29,970
When you do that, when you just say, Hey,
look, all we need to do is, is captured.

1023
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:33,940
Kill the bad guys. This is what
you do. You masquerade this,

1024
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:36,880
that capability to be able to do that,
which is an awesome capability,

1025
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:38,290
awesome capability.

1026
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,800
But that mass back capability masquerades
as a strategy and what you listen to,

1027
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:46,300
the things that you forget
about this list is classic.

1028
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,920
The complex problem before you
neglect wars, political nature,

1029
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:54,970
human nature,
inherent uncertainty,

1030
01:04:55,390 --> 01:05:00,250
interactive nature, and you neglect
that. It's a contest of wheels.

1031
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,800
So
that's,

1032
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:07,801
and there's some great youtube videos
where mcmasters talking about that big

1033
01:05:08,111 --> 01:05:11,910
lesson, learning that this raid
mentality was, it's part of,

1034
01:05:12,130 --> 01:05:16,030
it's part of the way you
defeat an insurgency.

1035
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:20,200
Part of the way you defeat insurgency
is capture. Killing the bad guys.

1036
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:24,760
It's awesome. But there's so much more
you have to address. That's like saying,

1037
01:05:24,761 --> 01:05:28,240
Hey, the way you win a Jujitsu
is to arm lock the person.

1038
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,930
You can even say as broad as that way
you win in Jujitsu is to submit somebody.

1039
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:35,440
Right? So if I taught you
every submission I knew,

1040
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:39,160
but I didn't teach you how to transition,

1041
01:05:39,161 --> 01:05:42,400
didn't Chichi hourly positions you would.
There's no way you could win.

1042
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,300
It's the same thing here. Is Submission
important? Yes. That's what a rate is.

1043
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:51,190
A rate is the submission. It's one piece
of it. It's not the whole game though.

1044
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,900
It's not the whole game.

1045
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:58,150
And I think that's what he's making very
clear here through that zero dark 30

1046
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:00,550
fallacy.
Next one.

1047
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:02,280
Yeah.

1048
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,650
Is The wild kingdom fallacy.

1049
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:10,290
Back when America was wholesome,
there was no reality TV,

1050
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:14,670
no Kardashians or anything.
So on Sunday nights,

1051
01:06:14,790 --> 01:06:19,620
American families would
watch this wildlife show
called mutual of Omaha's wild

1052
01:06:19,621 --> 01:06:22,440
kingdom.
And that show,

1053
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:28,310
what happened on that show is the host
Marlin Perkins would send his assistant

1054
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,090
Jim to conduct exotic and
occasionally dangerous fieldwork.

1055
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,480
This is the belief that we could be
like Marlin and just get gym or other

1056
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:40,950
militaries to do are fighting for us.

1057
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:46,680
And this is a way in the minds
of some people to reduce risk,

1058
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:52,040
but it actually increases risks because
you were relying on other people whose

1059
01:06:52,831 --> 01:06:57,831
interests are often times
in crew incongruent with
your own interests and not

1060
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:03,030
only don't have the capability to
fight and do what you need to do,

1061
01:07:03,510 --> 01:07:07,350
but oftentimes don't
have the will to do it.

1062
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:09,650
Yeah.

1063
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:13,370
So he's saying this idea that we can just,
hey, we'll just have the Iraqi's do it.

1064
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:18,110
Sounds like a good idea, right? Cause I
don't want my guys to get hurt or killed.

1065
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:22,190
There's a problem with that.
The problem is they can't do what we do.

1066
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,170
They can't do it as well as we do it.

1067
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:27,440
And they probably don't
have the will to do it. Now,

1068
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,140
credit to the Iraqis right now
they're moving through Missoula.

1069
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:33,530
They're getting after it there.
They're heavily backed by American forces,

1070
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,310
but they're, they're taking
the lead for sure. Hmm. So,

1071
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:42,050
but when we were in Ramadi, those
guys didn't have the will that we had.

1072
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:45,560
They didn't, didn't mean as much
to them. If you can believe that.

1073
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,490
I know it sounds crazy.

1074
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:51,200
We had a battalion of Iraqi soldiers
to talking about this with life.

1075
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:52,820
We had a battalion of Iraqi soldiers,

1076
01:07:52,821 --> 01:07:57,821
so 500 Iraqi soldiers that it come to
Ramadi as to to help out in the fight.

1077
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,250
They left,
they abandoned,

1078
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:05,180
they quit a battalion of Iraqi soldiers.

1079
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:10,460
And here's the weird thing. The reason
they brought this battalion in one,

1080
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:14,210
we needed more manpower.
Number two, they were Sunni.

1081
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:19,070
So Ramadi was a Sunni city and bulk
of the army at the time was Shia.

1082
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:23,990
So the, she is coming in and fighting in
Ramadi. Sometimes the Sunni's would say,

1083
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:27,110
hey, hey, wait a second.
Why these? She is in here.

1084
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:30,230
So the idea was to bring
the Sunni's in to help.

1085
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,870
And the Sunni's got scared.

1086
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:38,990
This is the Sunni battalion
got scared and left.

1087
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:42,530
And one of the reasons they said, well,
it's an a Sunni city. I just said, wait,

1088
01:08:42,531 --> 01:08:46,790
wait a second. That's the whole
point. These are your people.

1089
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,360
These are other Sunni's that are
getting murdered by insurgents.

1090
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:55,340
So it was just,
it was a tough situation.

1091
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,740
And my point in saying that,
and there's a whole,

1092
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,820
there's a whole nother
discussion we could have on that.

1093
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,610
But the point is that

1094
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,750
in order to win that fight,
we had to be on the ground.

1095
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,100
The Iraqi's were not going to do it
by themselves. They were not going to.

1096
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:16,960
And that's what this fallacy is.
Hey,

1097
01:09:16,961 --> 01:09:21,190
that if we just direct other people to
do it, yeah, then we'll be good to go.

1098
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:24,940
And we don't have to take any risk.
Now again,

1099
01:09:24,941 --> 01:09:28,540
how does that translate to
what we do, you know, business.

1100
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:31,090
How's that translate to business? How
does that translate to life? For me,

1101
01:09:31,091 --> 01:09:31,924
it's real simple.

1102
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,140
Okay.

1103
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:35,970
The important things that you gotta do.

1104
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,660
You gotta do the hard things that you
gotta do you gotta do you know it?

1105
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:49,170
Okay, Tim Ferris, can we outsource
some stuff? Yes, we can. Don't worry.

1106
01:09:49,171 --> 01:09:50,850
Tim will outsource some stuff,

1107
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,100
but the important stuff you have to do,
you gotta do it.

1108
01:09:56,940 --> 01:10:01,110
Gotta do it yourself. If it really
means something, you have to do it.

1109
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,390
You have to have the will and
you have to make it happen.

1110
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:07,620
Because if I outsource something
to somebody, if I say, hey,

1111
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:10,110
I really don't feel like
reading this book. You know,

1112
01:10:10,111 --> 01:10:13,620
I really feel like reading this book for
the podcast, can you read this for me?

1113
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,300
Well, yeah, somebody's going to read it,

1114
01:10:15,301 --> 01:10:17,400
but they're not gonna have my perspective
on it and they're just going to give

1115
01:10:17,401 --> 01:10:19,350
me some notes. I'm going to
sit here and read them. Yeah,

1116
01:10:19,830 --> 01:10:23,490
we're not going to get the product
that we need because that's important.

1117
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:28,470
I have to do the work myself. No one
can. I can't outsource that piece.

1118
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:30,450
Can't do it. There's actually
been, people have said like, Hey,

1119
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:32,700
I can read the books for you and
give you notes. I'm like, Hey,

1120
01:10:32,701 --> 01:10:37,410
I appreciate the offer. No, I got to
read it. I gotta do the hard part. Yeah,

1121
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,650
yeah. Now you say trying to outsource
that stuff. Echo Charles. No, no, no,

1122
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:48,840
no. Keep it in house for sure. The, the
congruency of, of interest, you know,

1123
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:53,310
that's a big one because you can't
even think that the person has the,

1124
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:55,950
the same interest in really.
You both can think that,

1125
01:10:55,951 --> 01:10:58,590
but just maybe in a different
way. Especially when
you're thinking creatively,

1126
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,950
like how you present this and what parts
do you think are important are going to

1127
01:11:01,951 --> 01:11:03,180
be slightly different.

1128
01:11:03,181 --> 01:11:06,220
Even if the person has the same interest
is it's going to be different. Yeah.

1129
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,730
So then at the end of the day,
when you expect a certain result,

1130
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,200
it's gonna be different. Yeah. We'll
let yourself down. Yeah. You know,

1131
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:14,970
just somebody just wrote, cause
we're Musashi, it's a giant book.

1132
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:19,050
And someone was highlight massage the
other day and kind of took a picture of it

1133
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,711
and he said,
you know,

1134
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:23,810
I wonder how close Jockos highlights
are going to be to my highlights,

1135
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:26,970
exactly what they're going to close.
They might even be right on maybe,

1136
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:30,540
but they might not be.
And I can't say, hey bro,

1137
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,310
send me your book and your notes and
then we'll do the podcast and I'm just

1138
01:11:33,311 --> 01:11:37,800
going to cheat. Can't do that. Just
like you can't say, Hey, you know what?

1139
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,040
Iraqi forces that aren't ready,
that don't have the same,

1140
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:43,470
here's the big problem with
the Iraqi forces at the time.

1141
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:49,040
The Iraqi forces at the time didn't have
a vision of what their country could be

1142
01:11:50,011 --> 01:11:54,480
like. So think about that.
We Americans, we had,

1143
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,920
we had inherently being from America,
we have a vision of what freedom is like.

1144
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:03,120
We know what that is.
Iraqi soldiers didn't know what that is.

1145
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:07,800
They thought, man, they lived under under
Saddam for their whole lives. I mean,

1146
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:11,610
all the soldiers that we worked with
lived under Saddam their whole lives.

1147
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:15,630
That's all they knew. So for them, we
say, no, you're going to have freedom.

1148
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,790
They're like, oh yeah, I don't know
what, what does that even mean?

1149
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:21,300
What does that mean? I don't know what
that means. We're, we're thinking, Hey,

1150
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:23,790
don't worry. These guys will fight.
They're going to fight for their freedom.

1151
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:24,990
They're going to fight
for their Sunni brothers.

1152
01:12:24,991 --> 01:12:27,480
They're going to fight for their Iraq.
They're kind of like, we don't even know.

1153
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:29,940
They didn't even really have
a good vision of what Iraq is.

1154
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:35,070
Iraq is a country that we used to be
underneath Saddam and now it's not.

1155
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:37,320
And we don't know what that means.
We don't know what that looks like.

1156
01:12:37,470 --> 01:12:40,590
We Americans had a vision of what
that looked like. They didn't have it.

1157
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:43,800
So how are they going to fight for it?
So to your point,

1158
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:47,070
they don't see what we see.
They had a different opinion.

1159
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,800
So who's got to go on there and,
and have,

1160
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:54,860
and who's gonna have the will to fight
the answers us in that particular case.

1161
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:58,230
And it's the same thing right now.
Like even in Missoula,

1162
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:01,290
even in the last time when
Ramadi was taken back by,

1163
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:06,480
by the Iraqi forces. Good, good on
them. Props to the Iraqi forces.

1164
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:10,110
Right now they're backed up by Americans.
Americans are, are saying, hey look,

1165
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:12,030
this is the vision.
This is what you're going to do.

1166
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,980
This is how we're going
to take this part of it.

1167
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,880
And that is the big difference
of why they didn't have the will.

1168
01:13:17,910 --> 01:13:20,760
They didn't understand what
they were fighting for.

1169
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,750
And you take anybody and
put them in that situation.

1170
01:13:22,770 --> 01:13:25,080
You don't even look at
Vietnam War, right? You could.

1171
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:28,140
The Vietnam War are our American soldiers.

1172
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:32,370
Some of them you can go watch
interviews. You know, they were saying,

1173
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:36,650
I don't know what I'm fighting for. Yeah.
Hey, they were actually questioning,

1174
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:39,120
I don't know what, we know what
America's like anymore. Right.

1175
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:43,740
Who's really reading,
reading this book by Jim Thompson,

1176
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:49,480
you know, longest held pow ever. And
when he got back, he was kind of,

1177
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,610
when he got back to America,

1178
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,640
he knew he was gone from 1964
until 1973 when he got back,

1179
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:57,660
when he left,

1180
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,660
America was fairly conservative in
and patriotic. When he gets back,

1181
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:07,620
people are burning flags, people are
protesting. He was taken aback by it.

1182
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:09,870
And so,

1183
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:14,940
so if you took somebody that for Vietnam
in 1970 in America's in turmoil and all

1184
01:14:15,221 --> 01:14:15,550
that,

1185
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:20,550
it's hard to have the same vision
that they'd had in 1964 which is like,

1186
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:24,670
Hey America, we're going to go stop
the communists. Communists are bad,

1187
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,350
communists are bad.

1188
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,890
But then you start having the
American Socialist Party that Tony,

1189
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:32,080
you that communist are good. And all
of a sudden the kids over there going,

1190
01:14:32,081 --> 01:14:32,621
hey look,

1191
01:14:32,621 --> 01:14:35,530
I don't even know what's going on but
I'm not sure I want to die here in this

1192
01:14:35,531 --> 01:14:39,160
jungle. And that's problematic.
And it's the same thing with,

1193
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,550
with the Iraqi soldiers. They just
didn't know what they were fighting for.

1194
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:46,400
If you asked them what they were fighting
for, they might say a paycheck. You.

1195
01:14:46,401 --> 01:14:51,280
Very few of them would say,
I'm fighting for a free and stable Iraq.

1196
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:53,200
The very few of them,

1197
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,120
some of them fought against truly
heartfelt fought against the insurgents.

1198
01:14:58,121 --> 01:14:59,560
They didn't like the insurgents.

1199
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,630
Insurgents were murdering people and
raping women and torturing people.

1200
01:15:04,631 --> 01:15:07,660
They didn't like that. Then they'd fight
hard against them, but that wasn't,

1201
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:12,550
not everyone experienced that.
Not everyone saw that. Yeah,

1202
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:16,630
and I'm sure they're kind of like,
you can tell him what you're fighting for,

1203
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:21,550
you know? And they can answer you for
sure. You don't feel, it's like, you know,

1204
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:24,880
like your dad tells you when you're
young, you dead tells you, hey,

1205
01:15:24,881 --> 01:15:28,990
clean your room. I want this room spick
and span like you don't get it. Yeah.

1206
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:31,000
All I'm going to take this whole meth.

1207
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:33,320
I'm just going to put it in
the closet just so he'll stop,

1208
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,000
leave me alone kind of thing. You
know? And then meanwhile, the Dad,

1209
01:15:37,990 --> 01:15:41,470
your dad has this vision is like,
look what's up with you?

1210
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:45,540
Why didn't you clean your room? Don't
you understand kind of thing. Yup. No,

1211
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:46,900
you don't.
You don't understand that.

1212
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:48,700
Your Dad's trying to teach you
that discipline equals freedom.

1213
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,050
My kids were running late
this morning going to school.

1214
01:15:53,710 --> 01:15:58,630
Why are they running late? Cause their
rooms are messy. It w you're running late.

1215
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:01,930
Everything stressful now when we're
heading to school. Why is that? Well,

1216
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,090
because you're, your room is
messy. Lack of discipline,

1217
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:09,640
lack of discipline causes mental stress.
Mental stress is not freedom. Yeah.

1218
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:11,470
But to your point,

1219
01:16:11,590 --> 01:16:14,890
even trying to explain to the Iraqi
soldiers why they're doing what they're

1220
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:19,891
doing on a really big level like
that is difficult is difficult.

1221
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,550
Now occasionally you get a good leader.
There was some,

1222
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:22,570
there was some good leaders.

1223
01:16:22,571 --> 01:16:27,130
There was one of the generals that the
Delta platoon commander worked with.

1224
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,580
He was a good dude.
He was a good leader and,

1225
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:34,120
and the Delta platoon commander actually
had some really good Iraqi scouts as

1226
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:35,950
well that really believed
in what they were doing.

1227
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:38,860
And I know that be the reason
I differentiate a little bit.

1228
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:42,100
The Delta platoon commander worked
very consistently with the same guys,

1229
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:46,180
a bunch as, as Lafe was working
with multiple different groups.

1230
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:51,600
So the Delta platoon commander had some
more tight relationships with some of

1231
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:54,640
those guys lifted too.
But anyways,

1232
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:58,840
some of those guys understood what they
were fighting for, but it's hard to,

1233
01:16:58,841 --> 01:17:02,560
just like you said,
explain what freedom is.

1234
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:07,180
And the other piece of it is in the,
in those situations,

1235
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:10,900
explaining what freedom is,
is no guarantee at all, right?

1236
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:12,590
That freedom is coming your way.

1237
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,860
These guys had been through so much
turmoil that country has been through so

1238
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:18,650
much turmoil there. Like, Hey,
you know what? We don't even know.

1239
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:22,400
You can promise us that but doesn't
seem like we're doing too well.

1240
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,130
How do we know you're going to win?
How do we know we're going to win?

1241
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,770
We don't know that. So you know
what? I'm going to lay low.

1242
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:32,390
You see where this thing falls and then
all they don't step up once I know who's

1243
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:34,820
going to win.
Tough

1244
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:41,240
next,
the RSVP fallacy.

1245
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:46,240
Thank you for the kind invitation to the
war, but the United States regretted,

1246
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,140
is unable to attend. This is the belief
that you can just opt out of war.

1247
01:17:51,590 --> 01:17:53,870
It's a narcissistic approach to war,

1248
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:59,080
which we define w only war in relation
to us and what we'd like to do.

1249
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:08,380
So this idea that you can just be
opt out doesn't work. The, the, the,

1250
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:12,770
the bottom line there is that
you gotta get in the game,

1251
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,380
the game's going to take place,

1252
01:18:15,410 --> 01:18:17,990
the game's going to happen and
you're going to be affected by it.

1253
01:18:17,991 --> 01:18:21,050
That's the key point. It's not a
game that takes place on a field.

1254
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:26,450
It's a game that takes place on a field
and expands out the crowd into the

1255
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:30,400
stands and into town and still scars.
Stuff starts getting burned. Yeah.

1256
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:35,240
And riots take place.
So you have to get in the game.

1257
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,920
That was the,
that was the fourth fallacy of worn out.

1258
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,880
I think that all those really show,

1259
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:51,770
not just how smart McMaster is,
but also how

1260
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:56,420
open minded to yes.
Which is a very important quality.

1261
01:18:56,421 --> 01:18:58,280
I also think he's a realist.

1262
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,920
He's a realist and looks at
things in a very real way.

1263
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,211
You know,
this is the,

1264
01:19:05,211 --> 01:19:07,430
what's happening and this is what
we needed to do to deal with it.

1265
01:19:07,431 --> 01:19:12,431
And also what's great about McMaster is
that he is not afraid to speak his mind

1266
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,160
and he's got kind of got in
trouble for that along the way.

1267
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,400
So I'm definitely

1268
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,960
looking forward to seeing how McMaster
handles all the challenges that are ahead

1269
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:30,140
of him right now,

1270
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:35,410
not only in DC but in the world.

1271
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:40,720
So it's going to be an interesting and
we wish him or I certainly wish him the

1272
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:44,810
best of luck in that pursuit.

1273
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,110
So leading off of little McMaster,

1274
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:52,450
and I'm thinking about going to a
little Q and a at this time. Sure.

1275
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:56,360
It's been a little while since
we did Q and a here. Yeah,

1276
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,050
I've been doing Facebook
live. Can you tell? Yeah.

1277
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:04,710
And what I've been doing
Facebook live, I have not, I,

1278
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,630
I'm purposely not preparing at all.
That's my goal.

1279
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:14,900
My goal is to not prepare at all
because in the second or the,

1280
01:20:15,871 --> 01:20:17,190
yeah,
it was the second one that I did.

1281
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,100
I started looking at the questions
ahead of time and I was saying, okay,

1282
01:20:20,101 --> 01:20:21,260
well maybe we'll just
take a couple notes here.

1283
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:25,080
And all of a sudden I started preparing
for Facebook live and then I realized if

1284
01:20:25,081 --> 01:20:28,800
I'm going to prepare, I'll
make it the podcast. So No,

1285
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,780
don't prepare Facebook live.

1286
01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:35,730
Ask me your question and I'll answer
it there on the spot. It's fun.

1287
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,840
It's different, right? It's easier.

1288
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:45,450
I can't do two podcasts a week because
don't have time to prepare for him,

1289
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,410
but can do Facebook live.
You can slide that thing in.

1290
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,980
Does it preparing for a live thing
with the dynamics of Facebook live.

1291
01:20:56,281 --> 01:20:59,970
Doesn't that defeat the live
kind of purpose in a way it does.

1292
01:21:00,030 --> 01:21:05,030
But we could do this podcast on Facebook
live so we could prepare it and we

1293
01:21:05,191 --> 01:21:07,440
could put it on Facebook live.
We could do that,

1294
01:21:07,980 --> 01:21:11,550
but then it would be a rehash
of what we're doing. And

1295
01:21:13,050 --> 01:21:14,490
the other piece of it is,

1296
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:19,880
is I think the Facebook live is a way
of people seeing a little bit more of me

1297
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:27,891
as a normal human being and not me as a
guy with all the answers on stuff like,

1298
01:21:29,761 --> 01:21:33,040
no, you asked me a question, I don't
really know. You know what I mean? And,

1299
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:38,130
and also, you know, obviously on this
podcast is, is usually pretty serious.

1300
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:43,920
And so I'm not like that all the
time. So maybe they could say, well,

1301
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:48,810
I, I have a serious side, no doubt.
Sure. But am I like that all the time?

1302
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:52,920
Yeah. So I think Facebook
live is a good way to say,

1303
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:58,140
and plus, I don't want to
answer some questions here, B,

1304
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:02,790
for a couple of reasons. Number one, man,
when somebody listened to the podcast,

1305
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,020
I want to make sure they're getting
something of high quality, right? Not,

1306
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:10,230
not just some fluff, right?
Yeah. We're not doing fluff here.

1307
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:12,540
If we need to do fluff on the podcast,

1308
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,760
we just won't do the
podcast because I don't,

1309
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:19,290
I don't want to somebody to press play
and waste time. Oh, you know what I mean?

1310
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:20,153
Yeah.

1311
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:25,250
I don't mind fluffing around and talking
smack on Facebook live because it's,

1312
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:30,600
that's what it is. It's an open
forum. We're going to have some fun.

1313
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:32,340
We're going to get after it a little bit,

1314
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:36,450
but it's not going to be super heavy
because if you want that come here,

1315
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:41,520
get your podcast on. Yup. Yes, kind
of more lightened up a little bit.

1316
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:46,010
Yeah. It's not like that's, it
is not like I said, okay. Hmm.

1317
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:50,400
Let's see. I need to show them my light
side. No, but if you talk to me live,

1318
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:53,190
it's like when Jody came on,

1319
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,840
Jody came on like after we were hanging
out for like an hour. He's like, yeah man,

1320
01:22:57,841 --> 01:23:00,480
when I was coming down I just thought
you're going to be like full on cycle the

1321
01:23:00,481 --> 01:23:02,940
whole time I was like, yeah, I'm
not falling cycle the whole time.

1322
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,460
If we're eating a burger,
we're good.

1323
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,490
I'm not going to be sitting there
while I'm eating a burger St.

1324
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:14,290
Let me tell you what, no, I didn't want
to do that when I'm eating a burger,

1325
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:19,090
when I enjoyed that Burger. It makes
sense. But yeah, if it's a live Q and a,

1326
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:21,910
you know how like at like the
muster or you know when you guys,

1327
01:23:21,911 --> 01:23:26,440
okay we're going to do some
Q and. A. That's the example
of like a live Q and. A.

1328
01:23:26,441 --> 01:23:29,590
You don't prepare for those
questions. You know, and, and, and,

1329
01:23:29,591 --> 01:23:32,680
and also what's interesting about those
questions is those, I've given some,

1330
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:36,460
I mean, if you think about any of
the podcasts that I've gone on,

1331
01:23:37,330 --> 01:23:41,530
Tim Ferriss', Joe Rogan,
Sam Harris, the, those,

1332
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,040
those guys ask me some heavy questions,
right? Those guys weren't just asking me,

1333
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:47,410
we weren't just be guessing right.
During those.

1334
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:51,700
So there's no guarantee
that I'm not going to get,

1335
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:55,870
get a little bit serious on your Facebook
live or whatever I'm going to do.

1336
01:23:56,050 --> 01:23:58,620
I'm gonna do what people
ask me. Right? Yeah. But

1337
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:01,210
yeah,

1338
01:24:01,210 --> 01:24:04,720
yeah. During the muster, who we do
a lot of Q and a during the muster,

1339
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:08,770
we get all kinds of questions. There's
some really funny questions at Reus Choir,

1340
01:24:08,771 --> 01:24:10,720
funny responses.
There's also some,

1341
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:13,660
some real serious ones that
require very serious answers.

1342
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:17,800
And what's interesting,
and this happens on Twitter to,

1343
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:24,110
somebody asks me something dead serious
question, like a very serious, you know,

1344
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:28,310
something that's emotional to me,
like about losing guys or,

1345
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:31,930
or something like that. Guys killed in
combat and I'll, I'll respond to it.

1346
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:35,170
And then two tweets later,
someone says, you know,

1347
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,080
I'm going to have some mint
chocolate chip ice cream tonight.

1348
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:41,440
You know what I mean? And so you go
through these. If someone's read,

1349
01:24:41,441 --> 01:24:44,320
they must think I'm schizophrenia
because I'm answering real serious.

1350
01:24:44,321 --> 01:24:49,130
Then it's real light. And
then it just kind of weird,
Eh, rollercoaster math. Yeah,

1351
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:51,730
it's an emotional
rollercoaster on the Twitter.

1352
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,600
Oh Lord.
All right.

1353
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,790
So Q and a Qa Echo Charles back
in the game. Back in the game.

1354
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:05,710
So yeah, first question Jocko, an echo,

1355
01:25:06,070 --> 01:25:08,440
should you defend bad leaders?

1356
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,260
It your superiors to your man.

1357
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,810
Think about that question. This
is a good, it's a good question.

1358
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:21,510
And we haven't done Q and a in a while.

1359
01:25:21,511 --> 01:25:23,130
And that's why I want to
start off thinking about that.

1360
01:25:23,190 --> 01:25:26,820
Should you defend bad leaders that
are people that are in charge of you?

1361
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,070
Should you defend them to your men?

1362
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:34,170
Now this is really a perfect example
of the dichotomy of leadership.

1363
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:35,643
Hmm.

1364
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:39,570
And this is one of those situations
that makes leadership very,

1365
01:25:39,571 --> 01:25:44,571
very hard because it requires a nuanced
balance to handle this correctly.

1366
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:52,500
So on the one hand, if we, if we,

1367
01:25:53,620 --> 01:25:53,990
okay,

1368
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:58,990
say our boss is a bad leader and doesn't
know what he's doing to figure out the

1369
01:26:00,021 --> 01:26:02,900
boss, hey echo, our boss does know
what he's doing. He's an idiot.

1370
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:08,540
We undermine his authority for sure and
we undermine the authority of the whole

1371
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:09,374
chain of command.

1372
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:15,020
So should you call out
when someone's sucks,

1373
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,080
you say, Oh that guy sucks. He's terrible.
Should you do that to your leader?

1374
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:21,110
The answer is no.
You can't do that.

1375
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,450
You can't do that cause
you're undermining everything.

1376
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:26,960
So you've got a horrible leader. You
can't just sit there to your boys and say,

1377
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:32,000
Hey, this guy's an idiot.
Can't do that. However,

1378
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:38,860
if you give full support
to this horrible boss,

1379
01:26:40,490 --> 01:26:45,490
then your troops who know a
good leader from a bad leader,

1380
01:26:46,010 --> 01:26:49,340
they know what stupid and what doesn't.
They know this, they know this.

1381
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:52,070
And if you are sitting
there backing them 100%

1382
01:26:54,320 --> 01:26:59,320
then they're going to know that you
either actually agree with the bad leader,

1383
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:00,283
which is bad,

1384
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:05,420
or that you're too weak
to stand up and say,

1385
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:09,620
hey boss, what we're doing is wrong,
so you can't go to one extreme.

1386
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:13,400
The boss is an idiot. You can't go
to the other extreme. The is awesome.

1387
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:16,970
Think about how hard that is. Think
about what I'm saying. This is a very,

1388
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:21,470
very challenging, so
what can you do? Well,

1389
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:26,450
okay, first of all, as a subordinate
leader, it is your duty to push back,

1390
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,990
right? To to say, Hey boss, I think
we're doing the wrong thing here,

1391
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:33,830
and this is why we spend a lot of time
trying to build relationships with our

1392
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:36,740
bosses so that we can have candid
conversations with them, right?

1393
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:41,120
Sometimes it's hard to do
that. It is, I understand,

1394
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,730
but when you have built a relationship,

1395
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:52,160
then you can go to your boss
and say, Hey, look, this isn't,

1396
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:57,290
this isn't good. Now, once you've
done that, then you can go to your,

1397
01:27:57,330 --> 01:27:59,600
go to your book, your troops,
and you say, hey look,

1398
01:27:59,601 --> 01:28:02,990
I went to the bosses when I told
him, you know, I told him that, hey,

1399
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,320
doing this method isn't gonna work. Well,
he explained to me while we're doing it,

1400
01:28:06,321 --> 01:28:08,720
this is what he said.
So this is why we're using this method.

1401
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:10,940
I know it's not popular with
you guys, but it's, it's,

1402
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:14,270
here's the reason why we're doing
it. So, so you made progress, right?

1403
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:14,991
Your guys are saying,
okay,

1404
01:28:14,991 --> 01:28:18,500
well he at least stood up to the
man and now he gave us an answer.

1405
01:28:18,501 --> 01:28:20,840
He told us why we're doing what
we're doing. And so that's good too.

1406
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,850
But the other thing is when,

1407
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:29,870
the easiest way to do this is
to provide an honest truth.

1408
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:33,710
Truth is going to be your friend here.
Truth is going to be a friend.

1409
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:34,430
Now I should,

1410
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:39,430
I should put a caveat around that because
the truth might be you think your boss

1411
01:28:39,681 --> 01:28:42,660
is a complete idiot and everything
he's saying is stupid. Okay, so I,

1412
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:46,550
I take it back. Don't use a
full on truth. And this is so,

1413
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:47,990
this is so interesting too,

1414
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:52,991
because clearly truthfulness is a huge,

1415
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:58,120
you know, it's a value that
I've hold very dear, right?

1416
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:02,280
And you gotta be truthful and all that.
I'm telling you right now, do not be true.

1417
01:29:02,281 --> 01:29:05,880
If you think your boss is an idiot and
you think the method that he's picking or

1418
01:29:05,881 --> 01:29:07,230
the plan,
he's got his stupid,

1419
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,110
don't be truthful your guys and
go down there and say, Boston did.

1420
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:12,310
He is not going to help your team,
right?

1421
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:16,770
We have to be smart about
what we're doing. But

1422
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,770
when you,
when you do that,

1423
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:24,720
what you need to do is to keep
it somewhere in the middle. Okay?

1424
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,350
So when you say something negative,

1425
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:33,480
don't get all crazy with the negative.
Don't get all nuts with a negative.

1426
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:36,810
What you want to do is say, you
say something like, Hey, look,

1427
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:39,780
I'm sure there's some
better ways of doing this,

1428
01:29:39,781 --> 01:29:44,130
but this is the decision that was made
and we need to make it work, right?

1429
01:29:44,131 --> 01:29:46,380
So I'm not saying it's horrible
and to say, look, hey guys,

1430
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,610
I'm sure to some better ways,
but guess what?

1431
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,940
This is what we are being told to do right
now and we're going to do the best we

1432
01:29:50,941 --> 01:29:54,750
can notice that I'm putting it from
like them to know we are making,

1433
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:57,910
I'm taking ownership of it. This
is now ours to execute. Yeah.

1434
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,060
So you want to do that and,

1435
01:30:00,430 --> 01:30:03,690
and I also want to focus more on

1436
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,020
as much as I can. I want to focus
on not the personality of the boss,

1437
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:14,610
but I want to focus on the what we're
being told type thing or what the mission

1438
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:17,880
is because I don't want to bring, I want
to keep the personality, the boss at bay.

1439
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:22,680
Sometimes you get a boss that has such
a raging asshole personality that you

1440
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:25,650
have to say something like,
you just, you have to explain.

1441
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,800
And that's when even then you want
to ratchet it down a little bit.

1442
01:30:28,801 --> 01:30:32,190
You don't say, Hey, the
boss is an asshole. You know
the boss is an idiot. No,

1443
01:30:32,191 --> 01:30:33,780
you don't say that. You
know, you say, hey look guys,

1444
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:37,710
I know the bosses is not exactly perfect,

1445
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:43,170
but I think he means well with what he's
trying to do and that way we need to

1446
01:30:43,171 --> 01:30:44,370
focus for that reason.

1447
01:30:44,371 --> 01:30:47,130
We need to focus on executing because
not going to help us to sit here and

1448
01:30:47,131 --> 01:30:50,040
complain about the boss. He might
not have the greatest personality,

1449
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:53,160
but you know what? His intention
is good, so let's support him.

1450
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,460
You know what I mean?
Something like that where you're not,

1451
01:30:57,410 --> 01:30:59,280
you're not giving him full support,

1452
01:30:59,281 --> 01:31:02,190
but you're not completely
throwing him under the bus. Again,

1453
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:06,810
this is so hard to do
because let's face it,

1454
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:10,230
the boys, the troops, they know what's up.

1455
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:13,570
They know when that boss is an idiot.
They know when he's unprofessionally.

1456
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:16,500
They didn't know when he treats you
like shit. They know that stuff.

1457
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:21,840
And so if you bow down, if you break and
you give that to them, yes, you're right.

1458
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:25,530
The boss is a jerk. Yes, you're right.
The boss treats people like shit. Yeah.

1459
01:31:25,531 --> 01:31:30,090
If you give them that you're
hurting the situation.

1460
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:33,660
And that's why also when you're
in a leadership position,

1461
01:31:33,661 --> 01:31:38,661
your job oftentimes is to buffer
between the jerk boss and the boys.

1462
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:40,050
You don't,

1463
01:31:40,050 --> 01:31:45,050
the boys should never know that the kind
of stupid harassment that you get from

1464
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:49,230
your boss, the boys should never
know that and they should think, hey,

1465
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:51,960
Jocko says this guy's good to go.
We're good to go.

1466
01:31:52,110 --> 01:31:55,410
There's never think that
this guy's an idiot.

1467
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:59,680
So
again,

1468
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:04,120
in both cases it's like
you can't go hardcore.

1469
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:07,690
You can't go hardcore against
either the plan or the person,

1470
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,830
but you also,
at the same time,

1471
01:32:11,831 --> 01:32:13,930
you need to give a little
bit of a pressure release.

1472
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:15,910
Just a little bit of a pressure release,
you know,

1473
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:19,630
got to give them just enough that they go,
you know what you want them to think.

1474
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:23,980
Do you want them to
think, hey, Jocko gets it.

1475
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:28,330
He knows he's not admitting
it to us and good on him.

1476
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:32,740
He's, he's keeping it
professional. They know how they,

1477
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:35,140
they know that John [inaudible],
they know I don't love the boss,

1478
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:39,910
but they know him keeping it professional.
So therefore they,

1479
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:44,920
they accept what I'm saying
and they stay part of the team.

1480
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:50,080
Yeah. It kind of feels like, I'm kind
of imagining myself as one of the boys.

1481
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:55,060
Oh, you're my boss in re we don't
really like your boss. Right.

1482
01:32:55,540 --> 01:33:00,400
I feel like, sure. If I was made
to feel better in whatever way,

1483
01:33:00,401 --> 01:33:02,170
just a little bit better,
that pressure release.

1484
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:04,960
I said just a little bit
better about the mission. Okay.

1485
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:09,280
And I trust you because of how you
always handle things or whatever.

1486
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:12,190
You know what? All right. It's
not the best funnest, whatever.

1487
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:15,670
It's not my first choice, but at least
we're doing it together. You know,

1488
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:18,130
I trust you and all right,
let's do this kind of thing.

1489
01:33:18,190 --> 01:33:20,320
And one of the key things
you just said is trust.

1490
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:25,650
So if you trust me and the boss is saying
to do something completely ridiculous,

1491
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:30,460
and I come down and say, Echo, guess
what we're going to do? We're going to,

1492
01:33:30,520 --> 01:33:32,950
we're going to dig this hole and
then we're going to fill it back in.

1493
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,800
I want to do it six times today.
Let's get to work.

1494
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:40,450
And you know it's stupid and I come down
and try and sell that to you without

1495
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,750
any explanation with that voice,
that voice,

1496
01:33:44,380 --> 01:33:47,800
I'm going to lose trust. You're
not going to trust me as much. Now,

1497
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:51,610
if I come down and say, hey, hey boys,
hey, bringing in, this is what's going on.

1498
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:55,270
Yeah. See, I'm going back to another
voice here. Going back to the leadership,

1499
01:33:56,080 --> 01:33:57,640
I said, hey guys, here's what's going on.

1500
01:33:57,820 --> 01:33:59,740
I know this is going to come
across as a strange task.

1501
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:02,830
We're going to get it done.
We got to dig these holes.

1502
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:05,650
I know where to fill them back in and
we're actually going to do this six times

1503
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:10,180
today. Again, I know it's not exactly
what we were planning to do today,

1504
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:11,830
but look,
let's get after it.

1505
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:15,160
Let's get it done and let's prove to
everybody that we can make this happen

1506
01:34:15,161 --> 01:34:17,650
faster than and all of a sudden were
wherever you were going to get after it.

1507
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:20,350
You know what I mean is no factor.
Whereas again,

1508
01:34:20,351 --> 01:34:23,140
if I go into like a Dorky
nerd voice and try and say,

1509
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:25,780
we are going to do this because
it's the best plan ever,

1510
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:31,000
I'm losing trust with you. I'm actually
hurting my trust. So this is a really,

1511
01:34:31,001 --> 01:34:33,130
really nuance thing.

1512
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:38,230
And my best advice here is to
try and keep it in the middle,

1513
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:41,710
right? Trying to be, and I'll tell
you, probably lean a little bit,

1514
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:43,630
lean towards being professional.

1515
01:34:43,631 --> 01:34:45,520
Lean towards supporting the
chain of command because,

1516
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,760
because the guys are going to know
when you give them that little little

1517
01:34:48,761 --> 01:34:52,040
pressure relief when you
say, Hey, I know this is,

1518
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:54,970
this is a little bit of a strange plan.
As soon as I say that, if it was like,

1519
01:34:54,971 --> 01:34:58,270
okay, he understands working with, I know
we'll do whatever he says, Hey Jocko.

1520
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:02,240
Okay Jock, we get it. You gotta you
gotta you gotta have us do this. Cool,

1521
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:06,790
let's do it. Yeah. It's when I come
down and say, hmm. And again the,

1522
01:35:06,791 --> 01:35:11,120
you'll realize that this is, this is the
opposite. I see all the time. You know,

1523
01:35:11,121 --> 01:35:14,210
if you come down and say the boss's plan,
we got to do this.

1524
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:17,600
I always throw that as like the
worst possible leadership is, hey,

1525
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:19,550
we got to do this because
we were told to do it.

1526
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:23,390
That's the worst possible leadership.
Not saying to do that.

1527
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:27,320
What I'm saying is a little pressure
relief. Just a little pressure relief of,

1528
01:35:27,950 --> 01:35:31,130
hey look, I threw up a different plan. I
thought my plan was a little bit better.

1529
01:35:31,220 --> 01:35:34,790
Boss came up with this, this idea, we're
going to go for it. It's close enough.

1530
01:35:34,820 --> 01:35:39,810
Just something like that. Just
like, I know, I know. Dig It.
Yeah, that's it. A little,

1531
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:42,380
let's give him a little,
a little nugget. Yeah.

1532
01:35:42,381 --> 01:35:44,510
I feel like I would feel
if you were to be like,

1533
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,750
this is such a dumb plan and I don't
know why we got to do it or whatever.

1534
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:51,380
I'd be like, wait, wait. Then why
are we doing that? Then my like,

1535
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:56,030
why are we doing it? Then you know, and
I wouldn't want to do that. No. So yeah,

1536
01:35:56,031 --> 01:35:59,720
it's like right in the middle of there.
It's leaning towards being professional.

1537
01:35:59,721 --> 01:36:03,590
It's leaning towards supporting the
chain of command with just enough of a

1538
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:07,380
pressure relief too to have them say,
I'll tell you a story. It's cool.

1539
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:10,400
This is real, real quick. This
was in the take your time.

1540
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,900
I want you to tell me the longest store.

1541
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:15,110
We're going back to ninth grade
through high school, College.

1542
01:36:15,111 --> 01:36:18,980
It's weird that I even thought of this.
So we, we, you know how like in in class,

1543
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:21,530
right, this high, early
high school, freshmen,

1544
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:26,480
you know in class they're like, hey, get
into groups, we're going to do this thing.

1545
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:27,470
And um,

1546
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:32,390
so we got into these groups and we did
some project little thing during class.

1547
01:36:32,391 --> 01:36:35,930
We're done halfway through glass,
we're done and we're about to present.

1548
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,950
The teacher looks at it and it was
like, oh, you guys got to do it again.

1549
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:43,310
But the teacher didn't tell everyone.
She tells me this one girl,

1550
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:45,010
Marla is her name come Marla.

1551
01:36:45,920 --> 01:36:49,340
So Marla comes back from talking
to the teacher and she's like,

1552
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:53,690
she was kind of the leader. No
one desi. But she, at that point,

1553
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:57,350
she was kind of the little leader that
liaison between the group and the teacher.

1554
01:36:57,380 --> 01:37:00,950
So she comes back, she like, cause
like we gotta do it again and were,

1555
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,170
and everyone was like, what?
She goes, we gotta do it again.

1556
01:37:03,171 --> 01:37:04,970
Like you could tell she hit accepted it,

1557
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:09,080
but just her being like sighing
kind of demonstrated that a,

1558
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:11,600
she feels the pain too. I dig
it, but hey guys, you know,

1559
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,900
we're not going to complain right now.
Let's just that little subtle thing.

1560
01:37:14,901 --> 01:37:17,330
But that's exactly what it did.
It kind of,

1561
01:37:17,660 --> 01:37:21,020
it basically accepted the order that
none of us really wanted to hear.

1562
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:25,190
But at the same time she demonstrated
that, hey, she feels it too, you know,

1563
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,440
and let's do what we did
again of course and whatever.

1564
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:30,170
I don't even know what grade we had.
Got an a plus,

1565
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:35,150
I'm sure Marlo work working her leadership
skills. It was weird that, I mean,

1566
01:37:35,151 --> 01:37:37,370
I don't know necessarily
that she intended to do that,

1567
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:41,420
but that was the exact effect.
And you can, thinking back,
I can see the elements,

1568
01:37:41,421 --> 01:37:41,720
you know,

1569
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:46,720
the little pressure release was her
not saying don't talk to me like dad.

1570
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,880
She said we gotta do to get, you know,
she didn't like oppose anybody heard,

1571
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:52,670
just heard little shit, mannerisms.
You know what she didn't do?

1572
01:37:52,671 --> 01:37:56,260
She didn't jump completely
on board the teacher. Yeah.

1573
01:37:56,460 --> 01:37:59,690
And be like we gotta do this
again. It sucked. No, she was like,

1574
01:37:59,691 --> 01:38:02,610
hey look we've got would have to do
this again. You know what I mean?

1575
01:38:02,611 --> 01:38:06,450
She just hated it enough. And
I'll say this, this question,

1576
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:09,390
I'm surprised it took so long to get
this question because this is a really,

1577
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:14,391
really good question and it also is a
incredibly important skill to be able to

1578
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:20,650
walk this line.
And it's tricky to do and it's,

1579
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,490
it's, it's sort of, this
might be one of the,

1580
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:30,110
this is like the type of thing that
helped me a lot in when I was in the teams

1581
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:34,230
was just being able to do this enough
cause you get have to do some dumb shit

1582
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:37,650
teams man. And you know
what it's like. Okay.

1583
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,020
Being able to translate a stupid,

1584
01:38:40,021 --> 01:38:45,021
something stupid and give enough pressure
relief too to make guys not just go

1585
01:38:47,070 --> 01:38:51,060
jock was just, you know, company guy,
right? He's a company guy. He look,

1586
01:38:51,061 --> 01:38:55,110
he just lives. Oh he doesn't stand up
for us. No, actually I do. But this is,

1587
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:58,710
you know, like lifestyle. Tell him that
story about doing paperwork when I'm like,

1588
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:02,910
no, we're going to do all the paperwork.
I went, I held the company line.

1589
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:07,890
But like in such a dynamic or her such an
overboard way that guys are like, okay,

1590
01:39:07,891 --> 01:39:12,540
yeah we're going to win. This is a
competition. So that's good times.

1591
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,870
Yeah. It's like a meat cause it seems
like okay. All that paperwork, it's,

1592
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:19,830
it's almost like the paperwork was
like in a front dude's like, Hey,

1593
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:23,430
what the US against them kind of thing
where it told us to do the paperwork and

1594
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:27,870
you were like, yeah, and
we're, yeah, exactly. You know,

1595
01:39:27,871 --> 01:39:30,840
so it's like you take it to the,
that's something I'd done.

1596
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:33,460
I've actually done that a fair amount.
I talked about the story before,

1597
01:39:33,461 --> 01:39:34,830
but like an officer candidate school,

1598
01:39:34,890 --> 01:39:36,690
every little stupid rule
that they threw at us,

1599
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:39,960
I did it to the nth degree and had
everybody in that class to the nth degree

1600
01:39:39,961 --> 01:39:42,660
where they were just going,
yeah, yeah. Going ballistic.

1601
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:45,240
So a story like that
where we're just going,

1602
01:39:45,241 --> 01:39:47,250
we're just going to take what's there,
take the order,

1603
01:39:47,460 --> 01:39:50,340
and carried out to the extreme
and take pride in doing that.

1604
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:54,180
That was another little tactic that
I use by me along the way. Yeah,

1605
01:39:54,181 --> 01:39:55,920
we're going to do that. We're
going to do, it's so hard.

1606
01:39:55,921 --> 01:39:57,420
You're not even know what your name was.

1607
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:02,940
That's another tactic you can take for
sure. They want us to Polish these boots.

1608
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:06,780
They want us, they want us to clean
this thing. We'll do it. Watch this.

1609
01:40:08,910 --> 01:40:12,480
All right. Next question.
Six question Jocko.

1610
01:40:12,510 --> 01:40:17,070
Has there been a situation in which
you took something to personally?

1611
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:21,480
How do you avoid taking things personally?
So the initial reaction is like,

1612
01:40:21,481 --> 01:40:23,640
no man, I don't take things too
personally. You don't want to keep to,

1613
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:27,240
but the actual factors. Yeah, I take, I
take everything personally, right? Like,

1614
01:40:27,241 --> 01:40:31,470
I mean I,
if I do something bad,

1615
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:35,790
I am very personally, I don't like
it at all. If I do something poorly,

1616
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:38,670
I don't like it at all. I take it very
personally. If somebody gives me feedback,

1617
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:43,290
I take it personally. This
is like, it's an ego thing.

1618
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:45,480
It's a pure ego thing.
Right?

1619
01:40:45,710 --> 01:40:50,040
And I just had to say this at a group I
was talking to just because I say ego is

1620
01:40:50,041 --> 01:40:53,770
bad all the time. He goes
good to egos. What drives you?

1621
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:57,800
Eagle is what makes you want to be
number one. Yeah. Ego is what is,

1622
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,430
it brings you pride in your work
and makes you work harder to give,

1623
01:41:00,431 --> 01:41:05,431
deliver good product and and be a good
leader and a good employee and a good

1624
01:41:05,741 --> 01:41:07,150
person. Right? That's ego.

1625
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:13,020
The problem comes when ego or taking
things personally actually prevents you

1626
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:17,160
from listening to the critiques
that you're being told. That's,

1627
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:19,150
that's the problem. So, for instance,

1628
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:22,510
we'll take this little podcast right
here that's got some critique on it.

1629
01:41:22,511 --> 01:41:24,310
The other day I got somebody,

1630
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:29,311
somebody sent me a little critique and
they said that I didn't explain cause we

1631
01:41:30,341 --> 01:41:35,110
had Andy Stumpf on here and Andy was kind
of rattling off that has his career in

1632
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:37,960
the teams and he's, he was rattling
off the career and the teams,

1633
01:41:38,140 --> 01:41:42,070
he lost some people, not a bunch
because it wasn't that complicated,

1634
01:41:42,071 --> 01:41:47,040
but he lost some people. And,
and for instance, he used an,

1635
01:41:47,041 --> 01:41:50,140
an an an acronym, um, or an acronym

1636
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:55,030
Lpl, which stands for leading
petty officer, which is the,

1637
01:41:55,270 --> 01:42:00,250
which is the second senior
enlisted person in a seal platoon.

1638
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:03,190
And I didn't explain that when he said it.
So there's an example.

1639
01:42:03,490 --> 01:42:06,100
So when I heard this, my
first reaction is like, oh,

1640
01:42:06,101 --> 01:42:10,780
you don't know what Lpl is called,
gold. Google, go Google it.

1641
01:42:10,810 --> 01:42:13,360
Why are you asking me?
Oh Bryce, just stop talk.

1642
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:18,730
And then that was pretty much, you
know, my, my ego was saying, hey,

1643
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:22,780
I can't believe this person doesn't dare
you. How dare you? As I thought about,

1644
01:42:22,781 --> 01:42:23,920
I was like, well, you know, I need to,

1645
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:26,670
I need to make sure in the
future that I'm more than,

1646
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:28,450
I'm more aware of what guys are talking,

1647
01:42:28,451 --> 01:42:29,950
especially when I'm
sitting here talking to it,

1648
01:42:30,190 --> 01:42:35,190
another seal who we have a common language
and we are talking about things in

1649
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:40,000
very conversational mode.
So we're not caring about anybody else.

1650
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:43,360
And that's sort of what the
podcast is often is like we're not,

1651
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:45,970
we're not talking to everyone
that's listening at this moment.

1652
01:42:45,970 --> 01:42:48,370
We're just kind of talking to
ourselves or amongst ourselves.

1653
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:52,480
And so when he throws out this words,
I need to be more aware of them.

1654
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:56,860
So if I took it personally, I might
not listen to, if I actually listen,

1655
01:42:57,190 --> 01:43:01,300
I can do a better job.
So that's,

1656
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:06,850
that's kind of it. And basically
that's the same with anybody.

1657
01:43:06,851 --> 01:43:10,330
When anybody receives any
criticism of any kind, they get,

1658
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:12,220
they take it personally.

1659
01:43:13,690 --> 01:43:17,380
And I think the thing is two things.
Number one,

1660
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:21,700
get over it so you can listen
to what the criticism is in.

1661
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:25,240
And also remember this, this is kind
of weird, I think maybe I'm wrong.

1662
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:30,330
What do you think the more angry and
the more personally you take some

1663
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:37,690
criticism, the truer it
actually is. Is that possible?

1664
01:43:38,350 --> 01:43:40,240
When something really bothers you,

1665
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:43,990
it's probably something that really
bothers you because you know it's true.

1666
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:48,840
Like when somebody says something
that just doesn't matter to me it,

1667
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:52,010
it's, you know, I don't take it
personally. Oh they just think that don't

1668
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,300
worry about it.
I'm not worried about it.

1669
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:58,280
But when somebody says something that I
know is true and they're pinging me on

1670
01:43:58,281 --> 01:44:00,470
it,
that's means I get even more,

1671
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:02,720
take it more personally and
get more angry about it. And,

1672
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:04,670
and then that should be an indicator,
hey,

1673
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:06,530
this is something you
actually need to fix.

1674
01:44:07,070 --> 01:44:10,930
It actually has to do with insecurity
more than anything. So it can be,

1675
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:14,560
it can be super true or it can be kind
of true or you can just be questioning

1676
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:17,910
whether or not it's true.
If you're insecure about it,
that's when it's going to,

1677
01:44:18,180 --> 01:44:20,330
cause you can be like, there
can be, okay. You know,

1678
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:23,180
let's say guys have a receding
hairline and they're like, oh, I don't,

1679
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:26,900
I don't care about that at all.
It's totally true. You know, and,

1680
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:29,680
or let's say I do care about
it. I don't like it, but I,

1681
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:33,080
I've known it for the last time I was 20
years, whatever. And someone's like, Hey,

1682
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:37,460
you know, you're hairline's receding
to care about that. I don't,

1683
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,970
I don't think they know. I don't know of
any, but I'm just saying certain things.

1684
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:45,230
Um,
and if you know about it or you know,

1685
01:44:45,231 --> 01:44:48,590
and you know it's true and c, you
won't necessarily be bothered, but,

1686
01:44:48,620 --> 01:44:50,750
but if you get someone who's like,

1687
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:54,080
it's starting to recede or
early on or it's like Dang.

1688
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,860
And they won't necessarily be, this
is just an example, hypothetical,

1689
01:44:57,861 --> 01:45:02,840
but they won't necessarily be concerned
about the actual hairline receding.

1690
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:07,100
They're more concerned about, oh, do
I look older and my unattractive now,

1691
01:45:07,101 --> 01:45:10,340
or am I losing it now? Or something like
that. That's what they're insecure about.

1692
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:13,430
So when someone points out some
symptom of that insecurity,

1693
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,890
that's when they're like, well, you
don't go to say that. Are, you know,

1694
01:45:15,891 --> 01:45:19,520
they get all mad and that goes for
kind of anything. So maybe, I dunno,

1695
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:24,470
maybe it's someone saying, hey, you didn't
explain this enough. Maybe you're like,

1696
01:45:24,730 --> 01:45:28,360
wait, what do you say? Was
that a junk episode kind of
thing? Or, or something like,

1697
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:30,100
did I not, um, you know how you,

1698
01:45:30,101 --> 01:45:32,260
you're good at explaining stuff
and simplifying them or whatever.

1699
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:36,110
Maybe it was like a, an attack ad or
something. He's a personal point of pride.

1700
01:45:36,170 --> 01:45:39,290
Yeah. Yeah. You know? Exactly.
I don't know, but maybe,

1701
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,930
but that's typically what
people get mad about.

1702
01:45:41,960 --> 01:45:44,180
It's not necessarily if
they know it's true or not.

1703
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:46,220
It's if they're insecure
about it. Right. Well,

1704
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:49,550
you wouldn't be insecure about something
that wasn't true. He was a thing.

1705
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:54,490
But sometimes you do, cause
you know, sometimes it's like
a weird, like mental, uh,

1706
01:45:54,510 --> 01:45:58,620
like problem. But you know,
girls for example, I'm not
saying all girls, but listen,

1707
01:45:58,820 --> 01:46:01,970
I'm going to totally generalize right
now. But you know, the girl was like, Hey,

1708
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:06,140
do I look fat in this? The
girls I can awesome shape or
whatever. And you're like,

1709
01:46:06,170 --> 01:46:09,080
ah, or worse. They always think
they're fat, that it's not true.

1710
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,800
That's not the response by the world.

1711
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:15,260
That's a perfect example though.
You know what I mean?

1712
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,810
So it's like that kind of stuff.
You know,

1713
01:46:17,811 --> 01:46:21,080
people are just insecure
about stuff sometimes. Oh,

1714
01:46:21,081 --> 01:46:24,910
and even though the girls are
in really good shape or, or,

1715
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,660
or even guys when especially like if
they're into like their physique or

1716
01:46:29,661 --> 01:46:32,580
something like that were,
I dunno,

1717
01:46:32,810 --> 01:46:35,600
they're at a party or so I've heard guys
like they go to parties and they'll do

1718
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:39,800
like dips or pushups before they walk in.
Cause like, so they're like more pumped.

1719
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:42,700
Aye, I swear. And is that why
you're doing some push ups?

1720
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:46,611
You know what I mean?

1721
01:46:46,611 --> 01:46:49,380
So like you were just a little
insecure about what I have said

1722
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,470
anyway. You know, they'll get that
kind where there'll be like, oh I'm,

1723
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:00,840
they'll think that, oh, I'm not looking
very cut up or something like that.

1724
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:05,410
You know, like that kind of stuff when
it's not true. Yeah. Yeah. No, I think,

1725
01:47:05,490 --> 01:47:07,230
I think that's a good point.

1726
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,770
And I think the bottom line is
when we take things personally,

1727
01:47:12,140 --> 01:47:17,140
I think it's actually not a negative
thing because it means that you're,

1728
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:19,830
there's probably something
that you need to work on.

1729
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:23,310
But I think what we need to watch out
for is taking it personally and therefore

1730
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:27,810
being mad and either be mad at the
person that told you which the person

1731
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:31,980
probably could be out aligned, you know,
saying some stuff that's offensive.

1732
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:36,210
But even if someone
offends you, well, okay,

1733
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,830
well let's fix it so you don't have that,
that,

1734
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:40,180
that weakness or that insecurity anymore.

1735
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,560
And so just know what your red flags
are. No, when you're taking somebody's,

1736
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,980
everybody take stuff.
Personally,

1737
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:48,450
I'm like Mister detachment and I
take so personally all the time.

1738
01:47:48,451 --> 01:47:50,130
When somebody says something
to me, I'm like, oh, okay,

1739
01:47:50,910 --> 01:47:52,230
why don't I go when I do to do better,

1740
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,860
do good job with seeing the big
picture though. You know, like,

1741
01:47:56,090 --> 01:48:00,450
cause a lot of times, you know, when I
always think back to the, you know, the,

1742
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:05,130
the relationship like okay,
let's say, let's say I'm at
home, I'm mowing the lawn,

1743
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:09,800
I did all this, these great
housework, chores, whatever.

1744
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:14,160
You know, dad comes home, mom
comes home and they're like, hey,

1745
01:48:14,610 --> 01:48:16,380
I thought I told you
to take out the trash.

1746
01:48:16,381 --> 01:48:21,260
Meanwhile everything else is spic and
span. So I'm like, I'm mad. You know,

1747
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:25,290
how dare you say that to me when I
did this? Me, me, my thing, my thing.

1748
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:28,650
But at the same time, they're right.
You know, so you do a good job of like,

1749
01:48:28,651 --> 01:48:31,620
you'd be able to kind of recognize that
even though you'd probably feel those

1750
01:48:31,621 --> 01:48:35,870
same things. You won't,
your default isn't wounded.

1751
01:48:35,871 --> 01:48:38,820
We'll do it and fight back
and make the problem bigger.

1752
01:48:38,821 --> 01:48:43,110
It's kind of like you'll feel it on
the inside and recognize the red flags,

1753
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:45,780
what's happening and you
go, Oh yeah, I'll kill her.

1754
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:49,080
But I got to remember to take
all the tress because the
truth is, that's correct.

1755
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:51,360
That is correct. It doesn't
matter if you did the lawn or not.

1756
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:55,620
The trash was a thing,
you know, so yeah. Yeah,

1757
01:48:55,621 --> 01:48:57,990
you did good job of recognizing that part.

1758
01:48:57,991 --> 01:49:02,991
I think a lot of times in our
case we don't do such a good job.

1759
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:05,640
No, I'm going to throw this out
there. This is a little off subject,

1760
01:49:05,641 --> 01:49:06,630
but it just made me think of it.

1761
01:49:06,631 --> 01:49:11,631
I was talking to Dave at the gym yesterday
and he was listening to the podcast

1762
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:15,660
and he, he lost his,
he lost his dad. Yeah.

1763
01:49:16,170 --> 01:49:21,170
And like six months ago and he was
listening to a clip from the podcast of me

1764
01:49:24,331 --> 01:49:25,560
basically saying,
hey,

1765
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:31,060
because someone asked what good
comes from when someone dies and he,

1766
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:34,760
he said, look, you covered a lot of stuff.
And it was super powerful and it was,

1767
01:49:34,770 --> 01:49:38,730
was very helpful. And he said, but
there's a one more thing. He said,

1768
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:42,210
there's one more thing that has come
from my dad's death that it's good.

1769
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:48,160
And I said, what? And he said it was

1770
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:53,160
like a slap in the face of go out and,

1771
01:49:53,950 --> 01:49:57,420
and get after it. You know, and
I kind of left that out and I've,

1772
01:49:57,450 --> 01:50:00,730
I've talked to other people and clearly,
you know,

1773
01:50:00,731 --> 01:50:03,540
when you lose someone that's
close to you and see the reason,

1774
01:50:03,570 --> 01:50:07,660
I guess the reason that I didn't think
of this is because in the teams you kind

1775
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:10,420
of like, you guys get killed, you know,

1776
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:15,730
and we all kind of already live with
the feeling of, hey man, I mean,

1777
01:50:15,731 --> 01:50:18,460
I say it all the time.
I'm going to live the best life I can.

1778
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:23,890
But for someone in the civilian
sector, and they haven't had any, any,

1779
01:50:23,950 --> 01:50:27,250
they haven't lost anyone day,
haven't had anyone died close to them.

1780
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:29,650
They get the feeling that many of us,

1781
01:50:29,651 --> 01:50:33,520
many people walk through through the
world with of I'm going to live forever.

1782
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:37,090
You know, I'm not going to die. And
I got all the time, I've got time.

1783
01:50:37,540 --> 01:50:42,070
And so he made this great point. He said,
you know, for me, when my dad died, he's,

1784
01:50:42,071 --> 01:50:45,940
you know, he's in his mid
twenties and he's been kind of,

1785
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:49,960
you know, I don't want to say the word
relaxing, but he's been, you know,

1786
01:50:49,961 --> 01:50:53,830
fairly crude. He's been
cruising kind of, and he's,

1787
01:50:53,890 --> 01:50:56,530
he realized he can't, he can't
do that, you know, he needs to,

1788
01:50:56,531 --> 01:51:01,510
he needs to get after it. So
cool. Cool story. Cool feedback.

1789
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:04,390
I thought I should let everybody know.
That's another good thing.

1790
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:06,970
When w if you lose someone and you,

1791
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:12,060
you're not accustomed to that and
you don't see how precious life is,

1792
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:14,050
cause a lot of the times it's pretty easy.
Forget,

1793
01:51:14,290 --> 01:51:17,710
it's pretty easy to forget
how precious it is when,

1794
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:21,880
when it's right there, when it's given
to you, you know, it's, it's like food.

1795
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:25,000
It's pretty easy to forget
how mean how precious was the,

1796
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:29,140
was the crappy loaf of French bread with
sticks and bugs in it that Colonel Rita

1797
01:51:29,141 --> 01:51:33,610
got, we got to the prison camp and Hanoi
and that was precious. And you know what,

1798
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,410
even colonel reader, three weeks later
he was like, oh, this, that bread. Even,

1799
01:51:37,430 --> 01:51:39,400
he's here, he's laughing. He's like,
that bread sucked. I was like, sir,

1800
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:41,220
here you said it was like the best
thing you've ever had. He goes,

1801
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,750
well it wasn't first.
So we all get,

1802
01:51:43,751 --> 01:51:48,040
we all get this attitude that you know,
hey, this is always going to be here.

1803
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:50,470
Well it's not always
going to be here so don't,

1804
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:54,600
don't treat it like it is taking
that for granted, you know,

1805
01:51:57,010 --> 01:52:01,390
next question.
Hi Jocko.

1806
01:52:02,380 --> 01:52:07,380
I'm being told in Jujitsu that I'm using
too much strength to execute techniques

1807
01:52:07,540 --> 01:52:08,950
and dominating roles.

1808
01:52:09,700 --> 01:52:12,880
I get after it in the gym and
try to be stronger and fitter.

1809
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:16,900
All were already limit my strength
against same weight training partners and

1810
01:52:17,080 --> 01:52:18,490
definitely don't pull,

1811
01:52:19,930 --> 01:52:22,660
don't bull rush or
overpower lighter partners.

1812
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:27,040
I want to improve my Jujitsu knowledge
and understand the intent of reducing my

1813
01:52:27,041 --> 01:52:31,360
strength and uh, it reduces my
strength to learn the skill. But where,

1814
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:34,600
where's the balance?
I feel like I feel like I'm doing uh,

1815
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:39,670
being penalized for working hard and being
strong and there has to be an element

1816
01:52:39,671 --> 01:52:41,710
of strength.
Two technique right

1817
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:48,140
now that I'm trying to do zero strength
working week positions and they still go

1818
01:52:48,180 --> 01:52:52,540
100% on me. I'm not learning
anything. Right. What he's asking,

1819
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:58,400
what is, what is my 25% stronger
than my training partners?

1820
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:02,090
100% of trained Nogi for four years.

1821
01:53:02,091 --> 01:53:04,970
But Gee only for 12 months.
Don't judge the white belt warrior.

1822
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:10,250
Okay. So you know,

1823
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:13,880
I don't think anyone is saying
use zero strength, right.

1824
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:16,030
It just be a or used to have a uh,

1825
01:53:16,070 --> 01:53:19,790
kids in the kids class that would just
like flop around like the use. No,

1826
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:24,170
they'd be like noodles. You
know, especially when you're
a partner and I say, Hey,

1827
01:53:24,171 --> 01:53:27,950
don't be that. So no one's telling you
to use zero strength. That's not the,

1828
01:53:28,190 --> 01:53:30,110
that's not the,
the goal here.

1829
01:53:30,290 --> 01:53:33,590
You just want to use less strength
and I'm the same way, man.

1830
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:37,040
I work out so I can be strong
and when we're rolling,

1831
01:53:37,400 --> 01:53:39,590
if I have to use strength,
I'm going to use it.

1832
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:43,550
You bench pressed me off off you the
other day from across side wall technique.

1833
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:48,470
Can you even claimed it at the time?

1834
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:53,070
That's all weight, so, so that's
good. Right? And, and you,

1835
01:53:53,110 --> 01:53:54,440
you used it cause you had to use it,

1836
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:56,840
you are going to get punished and
you're like, oh no, I'm not gonna,

1837
01:53:56,841 --> 01:53:59,510
I'm not gonna have Jocko across aside,
discerning in the role. So boom.

1838
01:53:59,540 --> 01:54:04,400
Got Bench press or watching
too, by the way. So, so yeah,

1839
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:07,760
we, we want to be strong for sure.
But I'll tell you, this is the music,

1840
01:54:07,761 --> 01:54:09,770
the key thing when I'm
going to train with someone,

1841
01:54:10,610 --> 01:54:15,610
I'm going to use just enough skill and
strength to stay slightly ahead of him

1842
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:19,400
just enough.
I'm not trying to crush them.

1843
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:25,640
If someone's, and it'll tell you if
someone's a way lighter than me then,

1844
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:27,890
but they have kind of equivalent skill,

1845
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,290
then I'm going to try and limit
my strength as much as I can.

1846
01:54:30,291 --> 01:54:32,060
So it's a Jujitsu versus
a Jujitsu for sure.

1847
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:37,570
But I'm definitely gonna use my
strength if needed for really,

1848
01:54:38,451 --> 01:54:42,800
for a couple reasons. The first
reason is because of ego. Sure. Right.

1849
01:54:43,070 --> 01:54:45,890
I don't want to tab, I want to get caught
in a bad position. I don't like that.

1850
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:50,400
Yeah. If you call, if you train,
like when we're done training there,

1851
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:53,420
I'm definitely using strength cause
I'm dripping with sweat, right?

1852
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:57,680
I mean I'm using physical attributes,
but that's not the only reason.

1853
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:02,740
The other reason that you have to use
your strength sometimes is you don't want

1854
01:55:03,561 --> 01:55:07,760
to give people the false sense of
security that a, that worked. Right.

1855
01:55:08,270 --> 01:55:10,940
Even your good training partners,
like you don't want to say,

1856
01:55:10,970 --> 01:55:13,700
oh the guy gets a position
so you just tap, right?

1857
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:16,550
Because he's in a
competition or in the street.

1858
01:55:16,590 --> 01:55:18,800
The person is not just going to
tap, they need to do it. Right.

1859
01:55:19,970 --> 01:55:24,860
So that's it. I guess the
bottom, the bottom line is,

1860
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:28,670
my guess is is this dude is
probably using too much strength.

1861
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,210
He's probably one of those guys
that's naturally really strong, man.

1862
01:55:31,220 --> 01:55:34,730
He works out and he's thinking,
I've been trained in Nogi for four years.

1863
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:36,050
So now when I put this guy on,
man,

1864
01:55:36,051 --> 01:55:38,900
I'm angry about it because I'm
falling behind a little bit.

1865
01:55:39,050 --> 01:55:41,960
So I'm gonna use some strength.
Yeah. I would say man, just try it.

1866
01:55:41,990 --> 01:55:44,100
Try and relax and just

1867
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:49,400
one of my favorite pieces of
advice to give relaxed Harger

1868
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:52,480
this,
relax,

1869
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,620
try and flow when you roll a little
bit and it definitely will make you,

1870
01:55:55,650 --> 01:55:58,620
it'll make you better in the end.
The more you relax the the,

1871
01:55:58,860 --> 01:56:02,640
the more the better you'll get at the end.
And certain,

1872
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:05,700
I found that like certain guys,
that's just,

1873
01:56:05,701 --> 01:56:09,100
they're just their method
really just strong. Yeah.

1874
01:56:09,101 --> 01:56:12,990
And that's how they roll and they're
just aggressive physically. That's how,

1875
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:15,300
and I found that they can,

1876
01:56:15,570 --> 01:56:18,990
a lot of times they
can get more technical,

1877
01:56:19,400 --> 01:56:23,490
but really that's kind of their,
their strengths in a way. And that's,

1878
01:56:23,570 --> 01:56:25,910
it's just their way of ruling
and some guys in the opposite,

1879
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:28,980
what now that you mention it,
there's some people that are like that.

1880
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:33,981
They have like an on and off switch
then either all on or they're just super

1881
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:37,620
docile. Yeah. It's almost like got to
find that middle ground if you can.

1882
01:56:37,650 --> 01:56:39,720
If you can't.
But people are different.

1883
01:56:39,721 --> 01:56:44,721
Like let's say like remember Franklin
mistruths phrase lexical at crazy.

1884
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:45,691
Okay.

1885
01:56:45,691 --> 01:56:49,860
Consider him where he's going to be real
technical and flexible and flowy and

1886
01:56:49,861 --> 01:56:51,990
stuff. And that's his
Jujitsu. You can, he can,

1887
01:56:52,200 --> 01:56:54,870
I need to be more strong and rigid
and aggressive. He can train that.

1888
01:56:54,871 --> 01:56:58,960
But his default is that
flowy, flexible way. And,

1889
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:02,760
and guys who are like this, I think
that's going to be kind of their default.

1890
01:57:02,761 --> 01:57:06,630
They can train kind of deviate a
little bit and get it more for sure.

1891
01:57:06,690 --> 01:57:11,310
But that's kind of just there. That's
the vehicle they have, you know,

1892
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:15,410
and uh, it's, it's almost like a genetic
thing. It's not genetic but it's,

1893
01:57:15,450 --> 01:57:16,230
it's kind of,

1894
01:57:16,230 --> 01:57:20,640
it's almost like the foundation of
their Franklin was a trip to roll with

1895
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:25,790
because he was so flexible
but not just in a normal way.

1896
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:28,590
You know what his is flexible and his,

1897
01:57:28,650 --> 01:57:33,240
his spine was like when you put your
weight on him and he would just like,

1898
01:57:33,450 --> 01:57:38,100
like jelly fish. Yeah. It was like an
octopus. It's exactly what I was like.

1899
01:57:38,820 --> 01:57:41,180
Well she kept training man.
He was so good. That's all.

1900
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:45,580
I'm pretty not too long ago. Yeah, he's
trained at like occasionally. Yeah. He,

1901
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:49,600
he was getting good for awhile. Yeah. It
really feel good though. Still good. Um,

1902
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:53,610
but yeah, it's kind of,
it's more of a mental thing.

1903
01:57:53,611 --> 01:57:57,160
Like if you mentally, there's drills
like you can do you remember? Um,

1904
01:57:57,270 --> 01:57:59,220
Jerry allowed in was his name.

1905
01:57:59,221 --> 01:58:01,950
He jammed into the needs but we used
to do this thing. He's like, Hey,

1906
01:58:01,951 --> 01:58:04,820
let's just flow. Right. And you know
how people say, let's just look,

1907
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:08,520
so then they're trying to kill you.
He wouldn't though. He would be like,

1908
01:58:08,521 --> 01:58:12,450
his flow would be like a fast pace and
you could even try to hold them down and,

1909
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,550
and he just be like falling flat employee.

1910
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:17,130
He would get you in a good position and
they need to get right out of it into

1911
01:58:17,131 --> 01:58:17,611
another,
you know,

1912
01:58:17,611 --> 01:58:21,990
like he was really good at flowing to
the point where you get kind of tired

1913
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:24,780
because you're moving so much.
It's not full speed flow.

1914
01:58:24,810 --> 01:58:26,190
It's almost full speed though.

1915
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:31,490
So I remember doing that a lot with him
and it really translated when I would

1916
01:58:31,801 --> 01:58:35,770
roll, it would be like, I felt
like that difference in technique.

1917
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,360
That's really good. I, I do. I
always do a warm up run with Andy.

1918
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:43,060
Like that would just go position possess.
We were going, but we're going like,

1919
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:46,350
you know, we're just go flowing. Yeah,
that sounds, I don't like the word,

1920
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:51,670
but that's what it is. I mean, that's
what it is. Don't ever do that with dean.

1921
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:58,300
No, I'm serious. Don't ever, no,
don't ever say listened to him.

1922
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:01,720
Say like, Hey, let's just get warmed
up because he's not going to do that.

1923
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:04,240
He's going to flow until he's in a
good position that he's going to smash.

1924
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:08,870
You said don't do it. You have
to just go hard. Good. Yeah.

1925
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:13,870
Yeah. And he's real good at that stuff
too, but that's a good way though.

1926
01:59:14,230 --> 01:59:16,780
Like if you, yeah, that's a
good way. That's a good way.

1927
01:59:16,781 --> 01:59:18,490
If you can see that's a good,
I see what you're saying.

1928
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:21,670
That's a good way to learn
to relax more. Yes. Yes.

1929
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:24,490
When that becomes more common because,
let's face it,

1930
01:59:24,491 --> 01:59:27,070
I mean if you're strong and you're
going into roles and people,

1931
01:59:27,071 --> 01:59:29,580
if to the point where people
were saying, hey, you're,

1932
01:59:29,581 --> 01:59:32,590
you're using too much strength from him,
you're getting,

1933
01:59:33,640 --> 01:59:36,850
if you're hearing that from multiple
people, there's an issue. Man.

1934
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:40,270
That's my point is even though
you're saying, well saying, hey,

1935
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:43,480
some people are just that way,
don't accept that.

1936
01:59:43,720 --> 01:59:48,720
Like who the guy that asks this question
don't accept echos thing of saying some

1937
01:59:48,761 --> 01:59:50,560
people just that way because that means
you're just going to keep doing it and

1938
01:59:50,561 --> 01:59:54,870
you to get better because he will. The
more you relax, the better you get. Yeah,

1939
01:59:54,910 --> 01:59:58,270
for sure, and of course I don't
mean it like that. I know. Yeah, no,

1940
01:59:58,330 --> 01:59:58,961
I know you don't,

1941
01:59:58,961 --> 02:00:02,950
but I'm saying like don't get that
miss conception that that's what Aco is

1942
02:00:02,951 --> 02:00:05,830
trying to say. Hey, you're just that
way. Go with it. No, don't go with it.

1943
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:08,530
Listen to what echo is saying when he's
saying, hey, find somebody to flow,

1944
02:00:08,531 --> 02:00:11,700
roll with and just let it flow.
It's going to be rare.

1945
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:16,270
You find a person who's kind
of default method is this.

1946
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:17,440
And then by the way,

1947
02:00:17,441 --> 02:00:21,460
I just realized I don't say flow role
cause I was thinking about when I say to

1948
02:00:21,461 --> 02:00:24,440
Andy or we don't say it anymore,
we just do it. But I used to write,

1949
02:00:24,441 --> 02:00:28,840
hey let's a get a warm up round as I
call him a warmup. Okay. Hello role.

1950
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:33,660
But sometimes not along. Sometimes it's
just like a technique sharpener have.

1951
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:38,260
Let's see. He does do it.

1952
02:00:38,261 --> 02:00:41,950
Say does do some flow rolling
drills and gets better at it.

1953
02:00:42,310 --> 02:00:43,270
I would,

1954
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:48,510
I would guess that there is going to
be a significant remainder of his game

1955
02:00:50,141 --> 02:00:54,640
that's going to be this aggressive
game. Oh for sure. For sure. Yeah.

1956
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,530
Homes is aggressive on the mat for sure.

1957
02:00:56,990 --> 02:01:01,990
Another little mindset that might help
is think less competitively cause you

1958
02:01:03,191 --> 02:01:06,390
know how like a lot of people from
there and really it's true though. He,

1959
02:01:06,490 --> 02:01:10,290
here's the thing, this, this element needs
to be there where it, when it's time to,

1960
02:01:10,450 --> 02:01:15,370
to spar, it should be
competitive. Otherwise it's like
what are we doing? You know,

1961
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:18,520
I want to know if I want you
to be competitive because
I want an accurate look

1962
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:22,390
of what it's like to roll with Jocko
or a guy like Jocko, big, strong,

1963
02:01:22,391 --> 02:01:23,560
good at Jujitsu,
whatever.

1964
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:29,200
If you're just flow rolling with me and
non competitively every single time I'm

1965
02:01:29,201 --> 02:01:31,130
not getting the work done I need no,

1966
02:01:31,290 --> 02:01:36,040
that's what I was talking about earlier
too is that's why you go, yeah, yeah,

1967
02:01:36,330 --> 02:01:40,100
yeah. You got to use strength. Yeah. So
it should be competitive, but if some,

1968
02:01:40,101 --> 02:01:42,590
if people are complaining you're going
too hard, you're going straight up.

1969
02:01:42,591 --> 02:01:46,280
Like every role is ADCC. Yeah. On
the line. Life or death, you know,

1970
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:49,820
kind of more in that direction.
The Mood Giles, snare.

1971
02:01:49,821 --> 02:01:54,500
So if you think maybe less of that and
understand that this is, this is training.

1972
02:01:54,501 --> 02:01:57,290
If you want to get less using strengths,
they'll pay.

1973
02:01:57,291 --> 02:02:02,000
You got to kind of train that stuff. I
like it. The middle. The next question.

1974
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:06,080
Next question Jocko. I need
some advice. If you've got time,

1975
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:09,980
we've got time. What's a good
course of action when someone lies,

1976
02:02:10,100 --> 02:02:13,760
betrays trust or just plain destroys you?

1977
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:22,280
Move on, straight up, move on,

1978
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:23,383
forget them.

1979
02:02:23,900 --> 02:02:28,760
They are lying and they are untrustworthy.

1980
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:33,500
So move on.
Now sometimes this can be hard,

1981
02:02:33,501 --> 02:02:36,770
especially if they've somehow
tied themselves into your life.

1982
02:02:36,830 --> 02:02:38,750
Especially like for instance,

1983
02:02:39,980 --> 02:02:44,000
you get the kids involved in a divorce
scenario. You, you can't move on,

1984
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:46,580
but you have to mentally move on.

1985
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:51,581
You have to emotionally detach from
that human and that's hard to do because

1986
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:59,630
obviously they were someone
that you trusted. It'd be.

1987
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:02,690
And the reason I know that you trusted
them is because they got to a point where

1988
02:03:02,691 --> 02:03:05,360
they were able to betray
your trust and destroy you.

1989
02:03:05,960 --> 02:03:10,040
So they, they, it's hard.

1990
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:13,220
But the fact that they
trust that you trusted them,

1991
02:03:13,221 --> 02:03:15,290
the fact that you had that relationship,

1992
02:03:16,130 --> 02:03:19,160
that's even more reason to walk away.

1993
02:03:19,190 --> 02:03:21,710
It's even more reason to move on.

1994
02:03:21,711 --> 02:03:24,650
You got to see them for

1995
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:30,110
what they are.
And this is an important piece right here.

1996
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:31,010
This is an important cause.

1997
02:03:31,011 --> 02:03:36,011
This is something I learned as a
young lad out there in the world.

1998
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:41,560
That person is not who
you thought they were,

1999
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:47,300
right?
They are not who you thought they were.

2000
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:50,810
The idea that this person

2001
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,230
okay,

2002
02:03:52,230 --> 02:03:57,150
was a trustworthy,
faithful companion is not true.

2003
02:03:57,990 --> 02:04:01,770
It is not true.
That person does not exist.

2004
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:05,310
They didn't exist and they don't exist.
It was in your head.

2005
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:08,940
It was in your head that this
person was trustworthy and you the,

2006
02:04:08,941 --> 02:04:12,080
they were everything you wanted them to
be and they were faithful, commanded.

2007
02:04:12,150 --> 02:04:14,970
That is a lie.
They are not that person.

2008
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:21,030
They have proved it.
They've proved it by their actions.

2009
02:04:22,650 --> 02:04:27,650
So move on and at the
risk of sounding callous,

2010
02:04:29,310 --> 02:04:30,420
get over it.

2011
02:04:32,090 --> 02:04:32,730
Okay?

2012
02:04:32,730 --> 02:04:37,530
Get over it. Do not
dwell. Do not dwell on,

2013
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:38,580
do not dwell on,

2014
02:04:38,660 --> 02:04:43,660
on on what it was and don't
dwell on what it could have been.

2015
02:04:43,921 --> 02:04:48,420
You were year when guys go through bad
breakups. You know it's, I just thought,

2016
02:04:48,421 --> 02:04:51,210
well, you're going to, it's
like, no, don't dwell on that.

2017
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:54,930
Deal with what it is right now.
What that person is.

2018
02:04:55,140 --> 02:04:59,550
Deal with reality except
reality and be be thankful.

2019
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:01,403
Free Alley.

2020
02:05:01,620 --> 02:05:06,030
Be Thankful that you were able to learn
before you invested morale more than to

2021
02:05:06,031 --> 02:05:07,860
this person.
Be Beat.

2022
02:05:07,861 --> 02:05:12,090
Be Thankful that you found out when
you did that this person was a liar,

2023
02:05:12,540 --> 02:05:16,740
that this person was unfaithful
as untrustworthy beat. Be Thankful

2024
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:21,780
that you know it and you
know it now instead of later.

2025
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,820
And you know what else is going to
make it a lot easier to get over these

2026
02:05:23,821 --> 02:05:28,560
situations is recognize that there's
plenty of people out there in the world

2027
02:05:28,561 --> 02:05:32,730
that are trustworthy and
there are faithful good people
there. They're out there.

2028
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,380
Go find one of them.

2029
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:36,453
But

2030
02:05:38,600 --> 02:05:42,080
don't think that that person that you
had was the only one in the world.

2031
02:05:42,081 --> 02:05:45,860
They're not. And you know
what if that I have sometimes,

2032
02:05:46,490 --> 02:05:50,210
sometimes people have a hard time making
that trust because they're so caught up

2033
02:05:50,211 --> 02:05:52,820
and they, they, they don't want to meet
someone else right away. That's fine.

2034
02:05:53,510 --> 02:05:56,870
Start with yourself.
Right? Rely on yourself.

2035
02:05:57,110 --> 02:06:01,750
Trust yourself because we won. When
someone breaks our trust, we, we,

2036
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:06,020
we question ourselves to yes,
like we think are my judgments bad.

2037
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:10,220
I'm not a good judge of human character
cause I totally put my faith in this

2038
02:06:10,221 --> 02:06:12,800
person and look what they did to me.
So now we don't trust her.

2039
02:06:12,801 --> 02:06:15,320
So you've got to build that trust up.

2040
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,280
You got to build that trust up back again
with yourself. How do you do that? Read.

2041
02:06:20,310 --> 02:06:20,780
Okay.

2042
02:06:20,780 --> 02:06:24,830
Right.
Learn workout.

2043
02:06:26,210 --> 02:06:26,961
Be alone.

2044
02:06:26,961 --> 02:06:31,580
It's okay to be alone so people
get freaked out when they're alone.

2045
02:06:31,581 --> 02:06:36,230
It's okay to be alone. It's okay. It's
okay to be alone. There's no big deal.

2046
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,633
Enjoy it.

2047
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:38,840
Okay?

2048
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:43,490
Do something productive and build that
trust up in yourself and you'll look back

2049
02:06:43,491 --> 02:06:46,550
at the situation. Learn from
it. We do that. It's an owl
post operational debrief.

2050
02:06:46,730 --> 02:06:50,360
Oh, you've put too much trust in somebody.
Cool. They broke your heart. All right,

2051
02:06:50,361 --> 02:06:53,240
Roger that. Let's see. What were the
steps? What should I have recognized?

2052
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:56,480
How many times did I say? Well,
you know, they didn't call me,

2053
02:06:56,481 --> 02:07:00,020
but it's probably just because
their phone was out of battery. No.

2054
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:04,550
Once your phone runs out of battery once,
okay. You don't let it happen again,

2055
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:06,830
right? Yeah. So you start
seeing those red flags to you,

2056
02:07:06,831 --> 02:07:10,850
the mistakes that you made and then look
for them next time around because you

2057
02:07:10,851 --> 02:07:15,590
deal with people all the time that
they made mistakes. The first run,

2058
02:07:16,250 --> 02:07:17,540
they go back and they
make the same mistakes.

2059
02:07:17,541 --> 02:07:19,850
The second run they go back and make
the same mistakes. The third run.

2060
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:23,480
That's when you got to start
blaming yourself on your situation.

2061
02:07:24,890 --> 02:07:28,580
That's why, that's why I said you got to
like build a relationship with yourself.

2062
02:07:28,610 --> 02:07:30,980
You got to learn yourself.
You've got to trust,

2063
02:07:31,130 --> 02:07:35,950
you've got to learn to trust yourself,
so spend some time doing that and

2064
02:07:37,690 --> 02:07:40,720
then when you go back and you start
dealing with people, because that's what,

2065
02:07:40,721 --> 02:07:43,810
that's what you got to watch out for
is that you become a hardened criminal.

2066
02:07:43,980 --> 02:07:46,600
If you don't trust anybody,
like you were talking about cops,

2067
02:07:47,050 --> 02:07:50,200
you know sometimes cops have a hard time
because they're dealing with scumbags

2068
02:07:50,201 --> 02:07:52,420
all day long and it builds up this,

2069
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:55,390
this mistrust of other people.

2070
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:59,800
So you don't want to have that happen.
You want to be suspicious of people,

2071
02:08:00,430 --> 02:08:02,620
but you want to be able to build trust.
Once they proved themselves.

2072
02:08:02,621 --> 02:08:07,621
So take those small steps and
start to build up over time.

2073
02:08:08,110 --> 02:08:10,630
Don't just jump in and give someone a
hundred percent trust out of the gate.

2074
02:08:10,631 --> 02:08:14,830
You don't know him. Don't know
him. You know, back in the day,

2075
02:08:15,820 --> 02:08:18,850
back in the day when old hardcore bands
used to have this t shirt that just said

2076
02:08:18,851 --> 02:08:22,540
trust, no one was like, yeah,
that's legit. Right? You don't,

2077
02:08:22,810 --> 02:08:26,590
don't go out of the gate with the big
trust on somebody with important stuff.

2078
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:30,280
Don't do it. But the good
news is, like I said,

2079
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:35,380
there's plenty of people out there that
are good people that you are giving you.

2080
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:39,320
You can give all your trust to
just take it slow brother. Yeah.

2081
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:44,730
So crazy how you just explained that
so simple and it makes total sense when

2082
02:08:44,731 --> 02:08:48,090
you're in the situation now the motions,

2083
02:08:48,240 --> 02:08:50,550
you know like you can't
just detach and be like,

2084
02:08:50,551 --> 02:08:53,340
what are the red flags that
I know you're too busy.

2085
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:56,590
No missing the person or
whatever your disasters.

2086
02:08:58,250 --> 02:08:59,083
But even

2087
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:03,960
throwing things and looking at pictures,

2088
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:07,470
that's the worst to get out the picture
and stare. I've seen guys do that.

2089
02:09:07,471 --> 02:09:10,440
I'm like, Bro, give me that.
Let me throw this away for you.

2090
02:09:10,441 --> 02:09:11,970
It's not going to help that person.
Yes.

2091
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:15,480
Always to me was,
was explaining like listen,

2092
02:09:16,760 --> 02:09:18,930
cause guys was no,

2093
02:09:19,200 --> 02:09:22,440
no, she wasn't. That is a lie.

2094
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:26,070
That person that you put put together in
your head that you've assembled in your

2095
02:09:26,071 --> 02:09:29,670
mind, that person doesn't
exist. They don't exist.

2096
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:33,000
The person that you dealt with was a liar,

2097
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:36,930
was unfaithful, is a
cheater. That's the person,

2098
02:09:37,290 --> 02:09:40,140
the person who wasn't this person that
you're putting forth in your mind.

2099
02:09:40,230 --> 02:09:44,790
That person doesn't exist. So stop. But,
but you don't understand the good time.

2100
02:09:44,820 --> 02:09:48,690
Yeah, I know. I know. I know. It's
a choice. Here's the trick. Okay. So

2101
02:09:50,260 --> 02:09:51,093
if,

2102
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:54,150
okay, that person lie at that part of the
cheater and what I kind of said there,

2103
02:09:54,151 --> 02:09:56,240
it was, look, you don't understand the
good time. That's a real part of it.

2104
02:09:56,450 --> 02:09:59,720
That's really it. It's like sure
they did this. Sure. She, um, uh,

2105
02:09:59,721 --> 02:10:02,060
flats my tires when she gets messier,
all that.

2106
02:10:02,270 --> 02:10:04,940
But the good times we have
are so good. So it's, it's,

2107
02:10:05,090 --> 02:10:08,660
it's proof that it's not about the person.

2108
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,360
It's not about the person that you
can see all the red flags and how they

2109
02:10:11,361 --> 02:10:13,780
mistreat you from time to
time or they'd be true.

2110
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:17,930
It's about yourself and how you're
sad now because of all these reasons.

2111
02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:21,900
But the trick comes with what
one of the tricks come with. Um,

2112
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:24,080
same thing I said about drinking,
where it's your brain.

2113
02:10:24,081 --> 02:10:27,200
Cause it's like chemicals. When you bond
with someone in certain, in certain ways.

2114
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:31,190
And it's different from, you
know, it varies from person
to person, but it's like,

2115
02:10:31,191 --> 02:10:36,070
I think it's like oxytocin or I
don't know where it's, it's it. Yeah.

2116
02:10:36,080 --> 02:10:37,370
It's so I don't want to go into it.

2117
02:10:37,390 --> 02:10:40,040
But you feel this bond
with this specific person.

2118
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:42,710
That's why you have these feelings.
Even though this girl like lies to you,

2119
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,640
you see her lying text messages on your
phone right now. You're looking at him.

2120
02:10:46,730 --> 02:10:48,320
Meanwhile,
you still still miss him.

2121
02:10:48,321 --> 02:10:53,321
It's a trick because it's saying that
your emotional wellbeing is attached to

2122
02:10:53,661 --> 02:10:55,730
this person kind of thing.
Right. And all the other stuff,

2123
02:10:55,731 --> 02:10:59,750
you just kind of ignore it. So it just,
like I was saying with drinking, right?

2124
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:03,500
Why know consciously like I'm
going to be hung over it tomorrow.

2125
02:11:03,590 --> 02:11:07,970
I won't get anything done. All this stuff.
Why do I want a drink so bad right now?

2126
02:11:07,970 --> 02:11:10,910
You know, kind of thing.
Um, and it's the same thing.

2127
02:11:10,970 --> 02:11:15,050
The chemicals in your brain are telling
you like this girl is essential for you.

2128
02:11:15,350 --> 02:11:19,150
You know, for your wellbeing's not, yeah.
Oh, that's the logic though. That's a lie.

2129
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:21,260
It's a trickle. Listen to the,
don't listen to your brain.

2130
02:11:21,261 --> 02:11:25,400
Listen to me that she is not
essential, bro. I'm telling you.

2131
02:11:25,430 --> 02:11:28,880
But that's the logic.
Those chemicals are blocking.

2132
02:11:28,970 --> 02:11:33,970
I have seen so many situations
where guys are just in,

2133
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:37,880
what's horrible is, I'm
sitting here saying this, it's,

2134
02:11:38,210 --> 02:11:41,240
you could be smacking someone in the
face telling them, move on, move on.

2135
02:11:41,241 --> 02:11:44,270
And they're not going to listen to that.
So that's all. So you to make a decision,

2136
02:11:44,690 --> 02:11:48,230
that's, that's, that's, it's
hard. And guys ruined their lives.

2137
02:11:48,231 --> 02:11:52,250
I mean the others do too. And Roseanne
guys ruined their lives, you know,

2138
02:11:52,280 --> 02:11:56,720
with over somebody that is completely
abusive, whether mentally or physically,

2139
02:11:57,050 --> 02:12:00,250
that just completely abusive and they
will ruin their lives for this person,

2140
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:04,880
that person. And you see in my mind, I
think it's because they build a person,

2141
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:09,050
they build a person on
the framework of reality.

2142
02:12:09,170 --> 02:12:13,550
They build a fantasy and they're in love
with that fantasy and they want to keep

2143
02:12:13,551 --> 02:12:17,330
it going. Right? It's a fantasy.
So stop and they get away.

2144
02:12:17,331 --> 02:12:21,260
They ignore like all the Quona version
and they remember the good times,

2145
02:12:21,261 --> 02:12:25,480
even if it's like 10 minutes a week,
they remember those good times.

2146
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:30,470
They ignore the red flags
foe because of that,

2147
02:12:30,500 --> 02:12:32,930
that you know that trick,
that chemical trick in their brain.

2148
02:12:33,260 --> 02:12:36,740
And so it reinforces that thing
that they built. You know,

2149
02:12:36,741 --> 02:12:41,010
that fantasy that they build. It's true.
This big. The reality is this big. Yeah.

2150
02:12:41,410 --> 02:12:43,610
And look the fantasy state
and they just attached to it.

2151
02:12:44,060 --> 02:12:46,180
You ever see a friend or whatever,

2152
02:12:46,190 --> 02:12:49,840
cause I'm assuming you've never been
in this situation like you ever had a

2153
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:52,880
friend where they're really into it.
They're almost ruining their life.

2154
02:12:52,881 --> 02:12:54,050
They're in bad shape or whatever,

2155
02:12:54,051 --> 02:12:56,840
and then whether it be all of a
sudden are years later, whatever,

2156
02:12:57,020 --> 02:12:59,000
they're thinking back and they're like,
whoa.

2157
02:12:59,001 --> 02:13:02,690
Was I think because of the chemical trick,
so to speak.

2158
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:06,020
Whereas off and then they can see all
of that logic that you're talking about

2159
02:13:06,450 --> 02:13:09,230
and like all my gosh man,
it's, it's almost like,

2160
02:13:10,430 --> 02:13:14,320
it's almost like you feel like you were
a different person when you recovering

2161
02:13:14,340 --> 02:13:15,081
from cancer.
I mean,

2162
02:13:15,081 --> 02:13:19,040
just the fact that you can't
talk any sense into people
and no to that situation.

2163
02:13:19,080 --> 02:13:22,520
That's the trick. You got to try
and, yeah, it's hard. It's hard.

2164
02:13:22,550 --> 02:13:24,590
But I think knowing that that's it.

2165
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:28,190
It's a chemical in your brain that is
tricking you and it goes for a lot of

2166
02:13:28,191 --> 02:13:31,980
stuff. Donuts, like all this
that's tricking you. If you

2167
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,670
know, like, Hey, and you say,
I'm not going to be tricked.
I feel it. I feel this.

2168
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:40,030
I feel the sadness. I feel missing this
person, but it's a trick, you know? Yeah,

2169
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:43,140
that's, that helps. It
totally helps. I like it.

2170
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:49,230
So move on, man. I know
it's hard. Trust us.

2171
02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:51,960
Speaking of moving on,
next question,

2172
02:13:54,630 --> 02:13:59,340
unless we want to talk about
this anymore. No, exactly right.

2173
02:13:59,341 --> 02:14:00,174
Let's move on.

2174
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:06,330
In what circumstances do you
recommend direct? I will hold on. Oh,

2175
02:14:06,331 --> 02:14:07,530
we're not moving on.
You're stuck on it.

2176
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:12,640
But what's horrible is been people killed
themselves in these situations over a

2177
02:14:13,501 --> 02:14:16,560
lie. Yeah, that's, that's
to me the trick, the trick.

2178
02:14:16,620 --> 02:14:21,620
But it's a lie in and guys or girls get
so distraught over this fantasy that

2179
02:14:23,131 --> 02:14:24,180
doesn't exist.

2180
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:28,200
And what's really jacked up
is if they could just move on,

2181
02:14:28,230 --> 02:14:32,220
they'd find a reality that was actually
congruent with what their desires are.

2182
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:35,930
It's out there. You could see people
all over the world. They're there,

2183
02:14:35,960 --> 02:14:40,530
they're in relationships, having
fun from every level, right?

2184
02:14:40,830 --> 02:14:42,890
There's someone out there,
but you,

2185
02:14:42,891 --> 02:14:46,170
you get caught up in this mental trap and,

2186
02:14:46,290 --> 02:14:50,700
and obsessing over a fantasy.
It's a fantasy. Don't, don't,

2187
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:54,960
don't obsess over the fantasy,
man. There's, you can,

2188
02:14:54,990 --> 02:14:55,920
you can get over it.

2189
02:14:55,950 --> 02:14:59,100
And there's plenty of other human
beings out there that are awesome.

2190
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:02,160
So go find one of them.
And in the meantime,

2191
02:15:02,220 --> 02:15:04,720
hang out with your Badass self.
Right?

2192
02:15:05,030 --> 02:15:10,020
And become a better person and working out
is a big one for sure. For sure. As it,

2193
02:15:10,350 --> 02:15:13,800
that's 100% just get it,
get in the gym and get after it.

2194
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:19,090
Jujitsu solves everything. Yes,
lifting solves every leg. Right.

2195
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:24,390
Okay. So what circumstances
do you recommend direct
attack in combination with

2196
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:28,170
indirect, if any? Or do you
have any examples? Yeah,

2197
02:15:28,171 --> 02:15:32,580
so we talk about flanking all the time.
I always recommend a combined attack,

2198
02:15:32,760 --> 02:15:36,810
right? If you only attack the flank,
well then the enemy's going to Justin,

2199
02:15:36,811 --> 02:15:38,580
they're gonna put all the defenses there.
Now it's not a flank anymore.

2200
02:15:38,610 --> 02:15:42,900
Now it's the front and becomes so,
so you need to feign attack,

2201
02:15:42,901 --> 02:15:47,901
or at least you need to attack with some
minor level of force directly so that

2202
02:15:48,031 --> 02:15:52,940
the enemy has to defend what you're
doing. And I mean, clearly when,

2203
02:15:53,680 --> 02:15:54,513
when we were,

2204
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:58,200
examples are pretty easy to come up
with where when we're doing raids like

2205
02:15:58,260 --> 02:15:59,520
assaults on buildings,

2206
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:03,600
you're gonna attack that building
from multiple directions at a minimum.

2207
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:07,020
At least you're gonna set distractions
on some of the other directions.

2208
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:11,160
And it was same thing we were setting up
Overwatch's. Yeah, we're going to have,

2209
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,650
a lot of times we'd have a main
Overwatch and we'd have a little,

2210
02:16:13,651 --> 02:16:16,410
another little flanker Overwatch.
I said, when you come to get us,

2211
02:16:17,010 --> 02:16:21,720
you're going to pay and like
a classic l shaped assault.

2212
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:25,380
There's a reason it's called an l shape.
It's shaped like an l. You have a,

2213
02:16:25,740 --> 02:16:27,240
you have a,
a fire,

2214
02:16:27,241 --> 02:16:31,300
a base position that's going
to put down fire on the target,

2215
02:16:31,330 --> 02:16:33,880
and then you have some newer element
that's going to come in from the flank,

2216
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:39,130
but even with that you, you, you have to
do a base element and a maneuver element.

2217
02:16:39,131 --> 02:16:41,020
There's a reason because you're going to,

2218
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:45,820
the base is going to put down fire and
then the maneuvers going to maneuver it.

2219
02:16:45,850 --> 02:16:50,500
So yes, those are, those are clearly some
of them. And it's the same thing. Yes.

2220
02:16:50,501 --> 02:16:53,080
It's the same thing in the
business environment, right?

2221
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:54,580
In the business environment,

2222
02:16:55,870 --> 02:16:59,290
if you're going to
maneuver into a new market,

2223
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:02,830
you don't just walk away from your
other market, right? You don't,

2224
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:06,040
if you're going to develop a new product,
you don't throw away your old product.

2225
02:17:06,041 --> 02:17:09,580
No, you keep, that's your base. You
keep that going and then you frank.

2226
02:17:10,300 --> 02:17:14,890
So it makes sense there.
Um, yeah. So absolutely.

2227
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:15,520
When you,

2228
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:20,520
when you're going to attack
attack from both directions.

2229
02:17:21,210 --> 02:17:22,870
I, in fact, I do that most of the time.

2230
02:17:23,490 --> 02:17:24,323
So

2231
02:17:29,520 --> 02:17:30,353
next question.

2232
02:17:32,090 --> 02:17:35,630
This actually isn't really a question.
It's more of a comment. Yeah.

2233
02:17:35,631 --> 02:17:40,260
I kind of turned it into a question. I
know you responded to the comment, right?

2234
02:17:40,340 --> 02:17:43,820
Yeah, sure. Just want
to say quick. Thanks.

2235
02:17:43,850 --> 02:17:48,170
I struggle with the daily
grind trading days for dollars,

2236
02:17:49,010 --> 02:17:53,660
but you helped me make it happen.
Yeah. And my comment was like, okay,

2237
02:17:53,661 --> 02:17:55,220
well thank you.
I guess

2238
02:17:56,810 --> 02:18:01,810
because I hope at the same time that
you're grinding that you're trading that,

2239
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:03,320
that you're,

2240
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:08,320
I hope that you're not trading days
for dollars long term because long term

2241
02:18:08,541 --> 02:18:10,040
that's a losing proposition,
right?

2242
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:16,540
If you're grinding and it's not
doing something you want to do,

2243
02:18:16,701 --> 02:18:19,130
if it's a grind that you can't embrace,

2244
02:18:20,120 --> 02:18:24,890
then you got to find a way out of
that. Right. You got to find you can't,

2245
02:18:24,891 --> 02:18:25,171
Trey,

2246
02:18:25,171 --> 02:18:28,340
you don't want to trade days for dollars
because dollars don't mean anything.

2247
02:18:28,340 --> 02:18:33,200
Days. All you got. So you've
got to find a way out.

2248
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:37,010
Now, this does not mean you
need to be rash about it.

2249
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:40,610
This doesn't mean tomorrow you walk,
you know what to do with this job anymore.

2250
02:18:40,611 --> 02:18:44,780
I'm out and now you're
broke. No, don't be rash.

2251
02:18:44,781 --> 02:18:47,150
And don't throw the baby
out with the bath water.

2252
02:18:47,180 --> 02:18:51,560
But do come up with a longterm
plan about what you want to do,

2253
02:18:51,561 --> 02:18:53,360
how you want to do it,
where you want to do it.

2254
02:18:53,930 --> 02:18:58,700
And this might take one year
or two years or five years.

2255
02:18:58,701 --> 02:19:02,870
It might take five years to get to
where you want to be. That's okay,

2256
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:08,000
that's fine. It's, it's actually kind
of cool when you're grinding right now,

2257
02:19:08,001 --> 02:19:10,160
cause you know there's something that
you're working towards in the long run

2258
02:19:10,161 --> 02:19:13,600
that's actually awesome. So, but,

2259
02:19:13,601 --> 02:19:16,280
but you gotta have an exit strategy.

2260
02:19:16,910 --> 02:19:19,400
You got to have an exit strategy.

2261
02:19:19,401 --> 02:19:22,010
You've got to plan and figure out how
much money it's going to take and what are

2262
02:19:22,011 --> 02:19:23,350
you going to do?
You're going to work two jobs.

2263
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:26,060
I'm going to save all my money right now.
I'm going to invest here.

2264
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:28,190
Then pay off my or whatever
it is you're going to do

2265
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:33,710
so that you can get yourself
into a position where you
actually enjoy doing what

2266
02:19:33,711 --> 02:19:36,110
you're doing.
That's what you want.

2267
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:41,210
And the one other cool thing about this,
like,

2268
02:19:41,240 --> 02:19:45,770
like I say, man, it's cool to grind,
man. That's what we're here to do.

2269
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:47,960
You're here doing stuff right?

2270
02:19:48,050 --> 02:19:52,120
If you're not doing anything well
then what are you doing that? So the,

2271
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:55,730
the other thing that's cool though
about grinding and working is,

2272
02:19:56,660 --> 02:20:00,570
is that when you get that freedom right,
that you work hard for it,

2273
02:20:00,571 --> 02:20:01,730
it can be so much more worth it.

2274
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:06,050
The discipline that you put into place
to get to that freedom that you want.

2275
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:11,480
It makes that freedom so much
more worth it. So I appreciate it.

2276
02:20:12,620 --> 02:20:15,260
I'm glad you're grinding.
I'm glad you're grinding hard,

2277
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:18,020
but don't just make that trade.
It's not a square trade.

2278
02:20:18,021 --> 02:20:22,400
Days for dollars is not a square trade.
Get it back under your control.

2279
02:20:22,401 --> 02:20:22,830
And we've had,

2280
02:20:22,830 --> 02:20:26,120
I've actually had some
really cool feedback on the
podcast of people that have

2281
02:20:26,121 --> 02:20:30,110
hit me up and said, hey, I, you
told me to plan an exit strategy.

2282
02:20:30,140 --> 02:20:32,990
I wish I could find this. The Guy said,
you told me to plan an exit strategy.

2283
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:37,610
He's like, that was whatever, nine months
ago I saved my money. I just did this.

2284
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:41,870
Now I'm in another business. I'm kicking
ass. Thank you. Right. So it can be done.

2285
02:20:42,890 --> 02:20:45,650
It's one of the things about
cool about being a human being.

2286
02:20:46,430 --> 02:20:48,380
You've got free will,
you can make stuff happen.

2287
02:20:48,700 --> 02:20:51,710
Oh it's a go make it happen man.

2288
02:20:52,210 --> 02:20:56,250
Isn't that a lot of tricks
there too where you know the,

2289
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:59,480
we'd talk about the disc,
hyperbolic discounting when you,

2290
02:20:59,580 --> 02:21:01,670
when you basically go
for the short term payoff

2291
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:05,930
in at the expense of the longterm payoff.

2292
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:10,460
So let's say you have an
exit strategy for five years.

2293
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,030
It helps actually it,
it's,

2294
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:17,090
this is like for real help night and
day where if you look at that end exit

2295
02:21:17,091 --> 02:21:18,680
strategy as like a,
you know,

2296
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:23,681
a goal or whatever and the time in
between now and then is preparation time.

2297
02:21:24,231 --> 02:21:25,110
That's all that is like.

2298
02:21:25,610 --> 02:21:29,030
So a lot of times like I remember one
when I was working at the nightclub that

2299
02:21:29,031 --> 02:21:31,430
was, that was a full on like
Ooh, nightclub called job,

2300
02:21:31,460 --> 02:21:36,320
all short term payoff stuff. Kind of day
to day, week to week. I get my paycheck,

2301
02:21:36,321 --> 02:21:40,190
I go hang out, go work paycheck, hang. So
it's all just short term payoffs. Right.

2302
02:21:40,490 --> 02:21:45,020
So I was in there for years, like
years. How many years? Seven.

2303
02:21:45,630 --> 02:21:49,850
Eight? No, six. That was the end of
like almost seven. Yeah. Nightclub.

2304
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:54,200
So I remember thinking when I was like
over it already. Um, I remember thinking,

2305
02:21:54,260 --> 02:21:56,930
Dang,
I feel like I wasted a lot of years.

2306
02:21:56,960 --> 02:22:00,620
I think back now I didn't cause I learned
a lot of like psychological stuff.

2307
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:04,880
But um, I remembered like
reflecting and being like, man,

2308
02:22:04,881 --> 02:22:08,150
I spent and yeah, I went to college,
all this stuff really slacked through.

2309
02:22:08,151 --> 02:22:10,040
Call it. I spent it the
same way, just like, okay,

2310
02:22:10,041 --> 02:22:12,470
I'll take this class because I
may or may not pass it, whatever.

2311
02:22:12,471 --> 02:22:17,420
I just want to play football and be cool,
whatever. And I reflect and I think,

2312
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:21,920
Dang, I spent my life preparing
for nothing really consciously.

2313
02:22:21,921 --> 02:22:25,530
I mean passively I did because I liked
certain creative things and that,

2314
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:30,300
you know, materialize for sure, but
actively like consciously, I was never,

2315
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:31,590
you know how certain people,
they're like,

2316
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:34,770
I want to be an architect for sure
and that's it. And I'm doing it.

2317
02:22:34,771 --> 02:22:37,350
And I know a lot of times if there's
family history in certain things,

2318
02:22:37,351 --> 02:22:40,290
it's like they know, you know, and
they wind up doing it a lot of time.

2319
02:22:42,210 --> 02:22:45,150
But I reflected and
thought, man, I'm here.

2320
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:48,780
I spent my life up to this point
preparing for nothing in life.

2321
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:50,850
I know about working out.
That's it.

2322
02:22:51,720 --> 02:22:55,230
So a lot of times when you're making your,

2323
02:22:55,260 --> 02:22:59,490
you find yourself in a grind that without
an exit strategy or something like

2324
02:22:59,491 --> 02:23:01,530
that,
a lot of times that will be the case.

2325
02:23:01,680 --> 02:23:04,350
Like I've spent my life kind of
preparing for nothing really.

2326
02:23:04,590 --> 02:23:07,680
But that's the good thing how
you're saying it can take a year,

2327
02:23:07,681 --> 02:23:09,330
it can take two years,
five years, whatever.

2328
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:12,810
Start preparing for that five years and
at the end when the five years comes,

2329
02:23:12,811 --> 02:23:17,070
you are prepared straight up. If you spend
one year doing something, focus like,

2330
02:23:17,071 --> 02:23:19,470
Hey, I got to get even something
like I'm going to play the piano.

2331
02:23:19,471 --> 02:23:21,750
I don't know anything.
Bow and Arrow, I dunno,

2332
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,990
you spend one year focused on it at
the end of the year you can be pretty

2333
02:23:24,991 --> 02:23:28,230
prepared. Yeah. Compared to the average
person. So he spent like two years,

2334
02:23:28,231 --> 02:23:31,110
five years preparing whatever
that exit strategy is.

2335
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:32,690
And you're for real prepared spend.

2336
02:23:32,940 --> 02:23:36,900
Look at that time as this is
preparation time. Yeah. And it's,

2337
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,930
if only

2338
02:23:41,530 --> 02:23:44,710
somebody comes up to you,

2339
02:23:44,830 --> 02:23:47,800
you've been working at the nightclub
for a year and says, hey, echo,

2340
02:23:48,130 --> 02:23:52,640
what are you going to do with your life?
And you're like, oh, it wouldn't eat.

2341
02:23:52,641 --> 02:23:56,000
You would immediately say, well, well
let me phrase that another way. Echoed.

2342
02:23:56,090 --> 02:23:59,980
Are you planning to, uh, you know, be a
nightclub bouncer for the next 25 years?

2343
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:04,140
You're answered clearly be no. Okay. So
what are you getting ready for? Yeah,

2344
02:24:04,480 --> 02:24:08,920
cause a lot of times this person
is aware that they're in a grind.

2345
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:14,590
A lot of times people don't even realize
that what they're doing, they're,

2346
02:24:14,591 --> 02:24:19,420
they're, they're marking time is what we
call in the military. You're marching,

2347
02:24:19,421 --> 02:24:22,090
but you're not going anywhere. You're,
your feet are going up and down.

2348
02:24:22,300 --> 02:24:24,730
You're spinning your wheels.
So think about it.

2349
02:24:24,731 --> 02:24:27,580
That's a great point that you just made
is what, what were you preparing for?

2350
02:24:28,330 --> 02:24:30,460
If you would have been learning
to play the piano, boom.

2351
02:24:30,610 --> 02:24:35,500
You can be in the game right now.
But so that's an important thing.

2352
02:24:35,501 --> 02:24:38,020
Especially when you start talking to
people that are younger, you know?

2353
02:24:38,050 --> 02:24:40,360
Oh I'm when they're 15, 16, 17 years old.

2354
02:24:40,480 --> 02:24:43,560
Cause there'd mark and time
they're having fun. Yeah.

2355
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:45,970
But it's cool to have fun.

2356
02:24:46,060 --> 02:24:50,500
Let's make sure we're making some progress
and building some capacity to have a

2357
02:24:50,501 --> 02:24:55,450
better future all the time. What can you
do to build capacity for your future?

2358
02:24:55,630 --> 02:24:56,440
Hey,
you know,

2359
02:24:56,440 --> 02:25:01,440
you heard Andy Stumpf and I talk about
this and we didn't even recognize that

2360
02:25:01,991 --> 02:25:06,490
there's anything else you could do besides
being the teams. That's it. That's it.

2361
02:25:06,850 --> 02:25:07,660
And that's kind of,

2362
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:10,540
that's kind of good because when you're
having teams you don't want to be

2363
02:25:10,541 --> 02:25:11,500
thinking about anything else.

2364
02:25:11,530 --> 02:25:16,120
And luckily the teams does give you
preparation for other things in life.

2365
02:25:16,121 --> 02:25:18,400
Cause you're in leadership positions,
you're going up, you learning skills,

2366
02:25:18,401 --> 02:25:21,490
you're learning whether you're learning,
parachuting and you're learning stuff.

2367
02:25:21,880 --> 02:25:23,980
Guys get out of the teams all time.
They become cops,

2368
02:25:23,980 --> 02:25:26,320
they become firemen.
So they can be all kinds of good jobs.

2369
02:25:27,340 --> 02:25:30,570
But if you're not in a job like that,
you're in a job like a bead,

2370
02:25:30,580 --> 02:25:33,520
a nightclub bouncer. Hey,
it's a fun job, right? Yeah,

2371
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:35,980
it's cool you're having a good time,

2372
02:25:36,370 --> 02:25:40,210
but let's make sure we have an exit
strategy on that one, right? Yeah.

2373
02:25:40,270 --> 02:25:44,540
And it doesn't even necessarily mean like
if I want it to be ultimately in Devon,

2374
02:25:44,541 --> 02:25:44,831
just saying,

2375
02:25:44,831 --> 02:25:48,940
being conscious of it where if I want
it to be a nightclub owner or something.

2376
02:25:48,970 --> 02:25:53,290
Perfect. Yeah, I'll stay right in there.
And, but here's the difference is I'm not,

2377
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:57,580
I wasn't consciously spending
that time preparing for anything.

2378
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:00,340
I was going for tomorrow for
it, you know, this weekend.

2379
02:26:00,760 --> 02:26:05,500
That's all I was going for. And a lot of
times, I mean in the nightclub it was,

2380
02:26:05,501 --> 02:26:08,590
cause it was like a very
recognizable payoff, you know,

2381
02:26:08,591 --> 02:26:12,760
cause it's fun and there's this party
going on. But even in these grinds,

2382
02:26:12,761 --> 02:26:16,690
like let's say working for
a moving company one time
it was the same thing I was

2383
02:26:16,691 --> 02:26:21,160
looking for the weekend. It sucked.
But I was like the work part stuff,

2384
02:26:21,161 --> 02:26:24,210
but I was looking forward to getting
off work. Okay. The relief is so it's,

2385
02:26:24,211 --> 02:26:27,070
it's the same dynamic, just
kind of negative, you know,

2386
02:26:27,071 --> 02:26:29,710
it's like a negative versus the
positive is the relief kind of thing.

2387
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:32,970
The moving company made you want to eat,

2388
02:26:33,190 --> 02:26:36,910
eat forced your hand to want
to go do something else,
like a different lifestyle.

2389
02:26:36,940 --> 02:26:39,490
Whereas the nightclub,
the sooner you can get,

2390
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:41,770
you can get distracted and
in that way you're like, hey,

2391
02:26:41,771 --> 02:26:45,580
this is just going to be cool.
Right? Yeah. So it's that
that carrot and the stick,

2392
02:26:45,581 --> 02:26:48,690
you know, the, you know, the nightclub
was, I was just eating that carrot,

2393
02:26:48,700 --> 02:26:51,350
those right in front of my face
every day or every week or whatever.

2394
02:26:51,420 --> 02:26:52,960
The moving company was like,
fine,

2395
02:26:52,961 --> 02:26:56,560
I'm just trying to run away from the
stick that's hitting me every day kind of

2396
02:26:56,561 --> 02:27:00,340
thing. Yeah. So I guess it just depends
on how much you hate sticks and carrots.

2397
02:27:00,370 --> 02:27:01,900
It's just so good.
And like you said,

2398
02:27:01,901 --> 02:27:04,810
we don't listen to our parents or we
don't listen to our people around us.

2399
02:27:04,811 --> 02:27:07,300
We don't listen to it, we just
don't do it. It becomes noise.

2400
02:27:07,301 --> 02:27:09,790
That's why even you saying, what do you,
what do you wanna do with your future,

2401
02:27:09,791 --> 02:27:12,580
bro? I've heard that since, literally,
since I could understand English.

2402
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:13,610
What are you going to do with your PR?

2403
02:27:13,930 --> 02:27:15,970
What are you doing to prepare for
your future? What are you going to do?

2404
02:27:15,971 --> 02:27:19,540
You see yourself doing the fruit? Well,
yeah, no, I don't know Leila. It's just,

2405
02:27:19,570 --> 02:27:22,420
it's a meme or Eddie, you
know, you hear it all the time.

2406
02:27:22,421 --> 02:27:23,320
So it doesn't mean anything.

2407
02:27:23,710 --> 02:27:27,340
That's why a lot of times it takes
like someone to either rephrase it or

2408
02:27:27,341 --> 02:27:30,400
straight up like show it to you somehow.
You know where it hits you.

2409
02:27:30,430 --> 02:27:35,260
Like Davis sock in his is he was cruising
and his dad died and you got shown.

2410
02:27:35,670 --> 02:27:40,210
Yeah. Okay. What am I doing? So
good stuff to think about. Yeah,

2411
02:27:40,300 --> 02:27:42,060
I mean personally I just
got tired of it man.

2412
02:27:46,510 --> 02:27:47,350
Well I'm glad you did

2413
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:54,160
x question. I think we got time
for one more question. Yeah.

2414
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:58,153
Okay.

2415
02:27:58,230 --> 02:28:01,480
Jocko,
I have read your book extreme ownership.

2416
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:06,910
My son and I listened to your podcast
on the way home from hockey practice and

2417
02:28:06,911 --> 02:28:10,150
while I can see your message,
I can't bring myself to employ it,

2418
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:14,470
which I would like to do so very badly.
Any suggestions?

2419
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:16,113
Well,

2420
02:28:18,010 --> 02:28:22,070
everybody wants to employ extreme and

2421
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,900
disciplines so very badly,

2422
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:29,060
but everybody also wants it to be easy,

2423
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:31,550
right?
They want some,

2424
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:37,570
some secret power that just makes
it happen and they think that I

2425
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:45,040
hold the magic key that's going to make
discipline the easiest thing in the

2426
02:28:45,891 --> 02:28:50,210
world. Well, I can tell you that
taking ownership of your life,

2427
02:28:50,211 --> 02:28:51,500
it isn't easy

2428
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:58,120
and living the life of
discipline isn't easy.

2429
02:29:00,020 --> 02:29:04,940
In fact, it's hard. That's why it works.

2430
02:29:06,740 --> 02:29:10,850
And so if you want to employee discipline,

2431
02:29:11,930 --> 02:29:14,780
there's only one way to do it.
You employ discipline.

2432
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:20,150
Stop looking around for suggestions
on how to employ discipline,

2433
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:22,970
because I'll tell you that

2434
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:28,310
listening to this podcast is not
going to give you discipline.

2435
02:29:28,311 --> 02:29:31,250
Reading the book is not
going to give you discipline.

2436
02:29:31,340 --> 02:29:35,120
You have to impose discipline on yourself.
You

2437
02:29:37,380 --> 02:29:38,690
ain't.
You do that

2438
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:45,200
with steps that you execute.

2439
02:29:45,230 --> 02:29:49,680
Small steps. Get up early, workout heart,

2440
02:29:49,740 --> 02:29:53,190
attack your daily tasks,
crush your job.

2441
02:29:54,360 --> 02:29:59,360
Don't waste time on on on
meaningless activities.

2442
02:30:03,140 --> 02:30:06,680
That's how
you employed discipline.

2443
02:30:08,090 --> 02:30:11,540
You get aggressive in
making things happen.

2444
02:30:12,370 --> 02:30:15,260
Be The discipline.
That's it.

2445
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:20,450
That's it. It's that simple.
And I'll say it again.

2446
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:26,450
If you want to live a disciplined life,

2447
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:28,610
that's what you have to do.

2448
02:30:30,230 --> 02:30:33,110
You have to be

2449
02:30:34,940 --> 02:30:35,773
the discipline,

2450
02:30:40,280 --> 02:30:45,110
and I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2451
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:49,520
So Echo.
Yes,

2452
02:30:49,550 --> 02:30:53,150
I know you've been kind of stepping
up the discipline and ownership.

2453
02:30:54,680 --> 02:30:58,340
Why don't you take some ownership right
now of telling people how they can

2454
02:30:58,341 --> 02:31:02,630
support this podcast if they want to.

2455
02:31:03,430 --> 02:31:08,000
I will
before supporting this podcast.

2456
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:12,020
I think we all should support
ourselves in this way.

2457
02:31:12,980 --> 02:31:14,990
Similar to like on the airplane.
Like I said before,

2458
02:31:14,991 --> 02:31:16,880
you get the airplane and the oxygen mask,

2459
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:19,070
you got to put it on yourself
before you can help the infant.

2460
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,710
Not that, not that this podcast
is an infant or nothing.

2461
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:25,350
Well maybe it is one year, whatever.
Anyway. You know what I mean?

2462
02:31:26,250 --> 02:31:30,900
So if you're, I've been into
working out more, more consistently,

2463
02:31:31,170 --> 02:31:35,130
we just ain't locked cause those, and you
know, I'm no stranger to the workouts.

2464
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:37,493
MMM.

2465
02:31:40,060 --> 02:31:41,320
I've been supplementing

2466
02:31:42,850 --> 02:31:46,150
my workouts with supplements as you know,

2467
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:52,240
um, Krill oil just got some more boom,
you know, that when you get new krill oil,

2468
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:56,560
like I get it now before I run out. You
know? I mean, it seems obvious like,

2469
02:31:56,590 --> 02:32:01,150
Oh yeah, you're, you're an adult
now and you're prepared. I like it.

2470
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:05,720
Yes, exactly. Which is new for me. The
buzz is still doing, I'm out of Krill oil,

2471
02:32:05,721 --> 02:32:10,410
how order, so now I know. Yeah, no,
no, no. That's not going on anymore.

2472
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:15,340
Which is another demonstration of
discipline really. We count that. Yeah.

2473
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:19,720
That's kind of counseling as a daily
discipline bordering Krill oil before

2474
02:32:19,721 --> 02:32:21,970
you're out. That's right. It's true.

2475
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,120
I like what you've done there when it
comes in. I'm not even out of my old,

2476
02:32:25,121 --> 02:32:26,600
but when it comes in
and feel it feels good,

2477
02:32:27,100 --> 02:32:30,640
oils in it feels good to
be prepared. Yeah. So yeah,

2478
02:32:30,641 --> 02:32:34,520
you feel prepared. You are
prepared. Yeah. You are. You like,

2479
02:32:34,521 --> 02:32:37,930
cause you are straight up. Anyway.
Krill oil. If you don't know

2480
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:44,280
what's Krill Omega threes
is it? Yeah. Anyway,

2481
02:32:44,281 --> 02:32:48,420
it's real good for your joints. It can
really, that's, I mean Omega Three's good.

2482
02:32:48,450 --> 02:32:51,690
Cool.
But the question is if you don't know,

2483
02:32:51,691 --> 02:32:54,210
it's kind of like what does
that do for me? You know?

2484
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,230
Well how's that going to look?

2485
02:32:55,231 --> 02:32:59,520
How's the Omega three is going to
benefit me in the Krill oil situation?

2486
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:00,750
It's your joints.

2487
02:33:01,530 --> 02:33:06,280
Especially if you do a lot of pressing
exercises and Jujitsu actually shouldn't

2488
02:33:06,320 --> 02:33:09,360
say especially, I'm just saying
including, but not limited to,

2489
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:13,140
hard pressing as you just exercises.
Like where are you done there?

2490
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:17,190
I'm telling you man, it's the truth. Um,
anyway. Yeah. So get on that Krill oil.

2491
02:33:17,191 --> 02:33:21,510
If you have joint, a joint
session situation, really,

2492
02:33:22,440 --> 02:33:24,560
or if you don't or if
you don't prevent it.

2493
02:33:24,630 --> 02:33:28,850
If I needed to do more preventative
stuff in my life, yeah,

2494
02:33:29,490 --> 02:33:32,670
it's funny. I'll take them like
I'll pull them out, you know,

2495
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:37,020
and they look like jelly beans. I didn't
realize it looked like my daughter.

2496
02:33:37,021 --> 02:33:41,880
She's four. So look what jelly beans. But
did she smell up? Nah, she don't bite him.

2497
02:33:41,881 --> 02:33:46,050
She, you know, you smell them. Smelled
like Krill oil. Hey, I was on deployment.

2498
02:33:46,051 --> 02:33:48,660
So they make disgusting jelly beans.
Have you ever seen those before?

2499
02:33:49,110 --> 02:33:53,940
They make jelly beans that tastes
like Puke, that tastes like what?

2500
02:33:53,941 --> 02:33:55,860
Like on purpose.
It's like a joke.

2501
02:33:56,340 --> 02:34:01,340
So I was on deployment in Iraq and
somebody sent me a care package,

2502
02:34:03,390 --> 02:34:06,210
a care package,
yet they were being funny.

2503
02:34:06,270 --> 02:34:10,380
They sent me some of them bad tasting
jelly beans. I didn't look at the label.

2504
02:34:10,440 --> 02:34:13,410
I've just opened them up because
I hadn't had any candy in a while.

2505
02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:16,560
I wanted some candy.
Boom. Took a mouthful.

2506
02:34:17,440 --> 02:34:21,340
Just pure Dang. It's disgusting. Yeah.

2507
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:23,440
So the Krill oil jelly beans,
more or less,

2508
02:34:23,441 --> 02:34:27,190
the same thing with vitamin Itam eats
up. Yeah, the packaging is different,

2509
02:34:27,191 --> 02:34:30,540
so they don't, you know, you
get those things anyways.

2510
02:34:33,310 --> 02:34:38,110
If you're interested in
these krill oil tablets,

2511
02:34:38,130 --> 02:34:41,510
this is what they are. I'm not krill. I
had a little tablet to yeah, eat them,

2512
02:34:42,130 --> 02:34:42,963
chew them if you want.

2513
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:48,580
Swallow my recommend because they
smell and taste like krill oil anyway.

2514
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:50,710
But they're good for your
joints. Yeah. On it. Okay.

2515
02:34:50,711 --> 02:34:55,270
So the really all the supplements you're
going to want to take is from on it.

2516
02:34:56,950 --> 02:35:00,460
So go to on it.com/ajiaco
if you want the 10% off.

2517
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:05,320
But like I said,
back to the support part where,

2518
02:35:06,280 --> 02:35:10,300
okay, so you know how like when you
work out and then you ever work on,

2519
02:35:10,301 --> 02:35:13,900
you're like a my knees or my elbow
or something is bothering them.

2520
02:35:14,290 --> 02:35:17,470
It's like your whole body's working fine.

2521
02:35:17,710 --> 02:35:21,290
You can bench a bunch, you can squat
a bunch, but it's like your elbow,

2522
02:35:21,291 --> 02:35:25,240
it's like holy, you know, you're, you're
only as strong as your weakest link.

2523
02:35:27,370 --> 02:35:31,510
Elbows, knees. That's your
weak link right there.

2524
02:35:31,930 --> 02:35:34,660
That's what the Krill oil does.
That's what it alleviates. You know?

2525
02:35:35,710 --> 02:35:39,400
That's important is what I'm saying.
Yeah, I agree with, here's the thing,

2526
02:35:39,401 --> 02:35:42,070
I didn't really understand
that, but at Bro, I've,

2527
02:35:42,160 --> 02:35:45,760
I've done it where I've taken
like Ibuprofen to like, okay.

2528
02:35:45,850 --> 02:35:47,020
It's cause it's just pain.

2529
02:35:47,650 --> 02:35:51,040
It's not like I'm going to pull like
if it's your muscle or something like a

2530
02:35:51,041 --> 02:35:53,680
strained muscle. Yeah, it's like a pain,

2531
02:35:53,690 --> 02:35:57,010
but it'll inhibit cause you have a little
chain decide to start taking krill oil.

2532
02:35:57,510 --> 02:36:00,460
Um, I mean I know I take and I
was like, yeah, you should try it.

2533
02:36:00,461 --> 02:36:04,120
Or did I say that or did you just start
trying it on your own? It was you,

2534
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:07,610
but I heard about it. You know,
my wife's, my father in law would,

2535
02:36:07,611 --> 02:36:10,900
oh screw it was better than
fish oil. I was like, cool.
I don't even take fish oil.

2536
02:36:10,901 --> 02:36:14,580
So it didn't really mean much
to me. I lift nothing. I'm,

2537
02:36:15,090 --> 02:36:19,600
I'm looking for gains bro. C'Mon,
I leave me alone with a girl.

2538
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:24,260
But yeah, that was it. And you
mentioned it and um, you know,

2539
02:36:24,261 --> 02:36:28,510
like you're not hobbling around
in pain and other, so I said, hey,

2540
02:36:28,511 --> 02:36:30,240
if chocolate doesn't let me go try.

2541
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:34,900
And then I got it from a guy that was
like a power lifter really strong and he

2542
02:36:34,901 --> 02:36:39,490
was, you know, 56 years old
when I met him. He was a
great shape and I said, what,

2543
02:36:39,491 --> 02:36:43,840
what'd you do? He said, yeah, I
told that's not the only thing.

2544
02:36:43,841 --> 02:36:45,970
He also works out hard and all that stuff.
But yeah,

2545
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,780
it's a good thing to know
about. That's really, that
was my point really. You know,

2546
02:36:49,781 --> 02:36:50,561
like my,
you know,

2547
02:36:50,561 --> 02:36:55,270
you can be strong but when you got
your elbow jacked up from being strong,

2548
02:36:55,271 --> 02:36:59,500
really you got to patch
that little thing naturally.

2549
02:36:59,501 --> 02:37:01,710
Like cause it's not like
you're putting quarters,

2550
02:37:01,960 --> 02:37:05,160
cortisone shots or in my case Ibuprofen,

2551
02:37:05,410 --> 02:37:08,710
just to mask the pain so you
can get gains. It's different.

2552
02:37:08,711 --> 02:37:13,060
It's like a whole thing. I was telling
them, Taylor, I was talking with him,

2553
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:15,320
we rolled through a little,
did we know? We didn't know.

2554
02:37:15,390 --> 02:37:19,700
We were just talking and uh, I told
him how old I was and he's like, what?

2555
02:37:19,880 --> 02:37:21,850
You know,
it's the Krill oil man.

2556
02:37:24,470 --> 02:37:28,790
Notice I didn't mention how old
nonetheless, if you like Krill,

2557
02:37:28,791 --> 02:37:31,130
I actually there's some good
soul, you know, the per case.

2558
02:37:31,131 --> 02:37:35,030
So there's this total strength
and performance to um, I was,

2559
02:37:35,120 --> 02:37:38,570
I was looking at that because it's real
interesting like stuff in the clinical

2560
02:37:38,571 --> 02:37:43,380
studies, it's over time. So
it is considered a preworkout.

2561
02:37:43,460 --> 02:37:46,970
So typically when people
take it consistently,

2562
02:37:47,030 --> 02:37:51,350
consistently out your gains,
it's like a cumulative effect.

2563
02:37:51,810 --> 02:37:53,060
What I mean,
just like Krill oil though,

2564
02:37:53,090 --> 02:37:56,960
really like because here's why I
got traded. I didn't get trick.

2565
02:37:56,961 --> 02:37:58,850
But here's why I misunderstood.

2566
02:38:00,080 --> 02:38:05,080
Is usually a preworkout has like caffeine
and stimulants and Cheryl have like

2567
02:38:05,390 --> 02:38:07,580
other stuff allegedly,
I don't know.

2568
02:38:07,850 --> 02:38:12,850
But usually you take a pre workout so
you get fired up physiologically to go

2569
02:38:12,921 --> 02:38:15,110
lift, get big pump,
get all this, you know,

2570
02:38:15,140 --> 02:38:17,750
this performance stuff or whatever
from the caffeine and all that.

2571
02:38:19,130 --> 02:38:23,780
Total strength. And performance doesn't
have caffeine. Yeah. So it's a different,

2572
02:38:23,781 --> 02:38:27,280
it's a whole different kind of
system that's giving you the benefit.

2573
02:38:27,310 --> 02:38:30,230
Feels good though. Yeah,
that and but true tech too.

2574
02:38:30,290 --> 02:38:33,910
Same thing where you can take it that day
and you'll feel it that day because it

2575
02:38:34,310 --> 02:38:35,143
helps.

2576
02:38:35,260 --> 02:38:39,650
Oxygenate guy said I double at double dip
on those to get all of it all up on it.

2577
02:38:39,651 --> 02:38:44,480
And downfall trip to South Africa.
I didn't have either. Oh Dang. Um,

2578
02:38:45,020 --> 02:38:49,070
what do you call it when you don't
take what's up? Go on slick. I guess

2579
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:53,240
here we had some good rolls
down there too. Yeah, I was,

2580
02:38:53,360 --> 02:38:57,890
I was thinking to myself back to
the guys that were down there,

2581
02:38:58,730 --> 02:39:01,880
chef and Richie, they're like,
Hey, do you know tomorrow night?

2582
02:39:01,881 --> 02:39:06,881
Because I went and rolled the first night
at their fight fit and the the first

2583
02:39:07,581 --> 02:39:08,930
night, you know, we'd trained
a little bit, you know,

2584
02:39:08,931 --> 02:39:11,060
but we were hanging out
and then they said, hey,

2585
02:39:11,061 --> 02:39:13,250
when you come back tomorrow we're
just going to do like 10 rounds,

2586
02:39:13,370 --> 02:39:15,110
ten five minute rounds.
I was like, okay, cool.

2587
02:39:15,290 --> 02:39:19,310
And then I got the home and the
next morning or the next afternoon,

2588
02:39:19,311 --> 02:39:20,500
we were heading over there. I said, yeah,

2589
02:39:20,580 --> 02:39:23,510
I wouldn't mind having a little bit of
shroom tech. Right. But I didn't have it.

2590
02:39:23,511 --> 02:39:28,430
He had to go slick. Good
Times. Amen. You know, and hey,

2591
02:39:28,431 --> 02:39:32,900
go and slick. That's cool. But you
don't have to. Yeah, no. I mean,

2592
02:39:32,901 --> 02:39:37,850
we didn't want her, I wanted to
have a little bit that some of us,

2593
02:39:37,851 --> 02:39:40,550
we don't want that be, I mean, also
we're going to take this room tech,

2594
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:42,550
we're going to take the,
the cro to me, again,

2595
02:39:42,551 --> 02:39:45,680
back not to go too deep on the Krill oil,

2596
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:48,800
but that one I think is like an essential,
that's like an everyday thing.

2597
02:39:49,070 --> 02:39:53,250
You know, like people, they'll
drink coffee every single
day. You know what I mean?

2598
02:39:53,251 --> 02:39:55,670
Yeah.
And Co I say cool drink coffee,

2599
02:39:55,671 --> 02:39:59,390
but it should be like that because the
crew is way more beneficial than the

2600
02:39:59,391 --> 02:40:04,190
coffee. I mean, coffee is more like,
it's like an immediate thing anyway.

2601
02:40:04,820 --> 02:40:09,260
Anyway, you'd like to stuffs,
um, these cool supplements, good.

2602
02:40:09,270 --> 02:40:12,140
Simply the best supplements.

Also a good way to support the podcast

2605
02:40:20,360 --> 02:40:24,470
is the Amazon Click through all how all
that is is before you do your Amazon

2606
02:40:24,471 --> 02:40:28,550
shopping, click through the website. I got
a banner, little Amazon shopping banner,

2607
02:40:29,300 --> 02:40:34,300
got the dot.com got the.com.uk one and
I want to say the Germany one two mm,

2608
02:40:37,180 --> 02:40:38,013
yeah.

2609
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:39,670
Over there on the side of the website.
Uh,

2610
02:40:39,690 --> 02:40:42,420
Jocko podcast.com and also up top on the,

2611
02:40:42,421 --> 02:40:45,200
on the navigation menu as we
to find is what you're saying.

2612
02:40:45,220 --> 02:40:48,870
Easier than it was before for sure.
Well that's good. And then on the store,

2613
02:40:48,871 --> 02:40:52,950
I think it's like in the
support tab anyway. Before
you do your Amazon shopping,

2614
02:40:53,010 --> 02:40:57,030
click on that first then do your shopping
regardless of what you're buying.

2615
02:40:59,310 --> 02:41:03,000
I always make the sodium in the water
reference cause really that's what it is

2616
02:41:03,001 --> 02:41:07,440
really. That's the best reference. I
mean the best analogy, you know? Okay.

2617
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:10,640
It is bro. Okay. I said okay. Yeah,

2618
02:41:10,650 --> 02:41:14,400
but the way the tone where it's over,
but here's the thing that's a big deal.

2619
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:20,790
Small piece of sodium. Drop it in water.
See what happens. Just see what happens.

2620
02:41:20,791 --> 02:41:23,880
Actually don't do that. Look at it
and look up a video. See what happens.

2621
02:41:23,881 --> 02:41:27,540
That's what's good. And that's what
you are really, you do this law.

2622
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:30,660
Actually the biggest thing is people
don't. People think it's not a big deal.

2623
02:41:31,290 --> 02:41:33,600
That's a thing that can kill
the little piece of sodium.

2624
02:41:33,601 --> 02:41:36,860
Tell that to the sodium
when he hits water. Yeah,

2625
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:41,310
you go and you did smell action takes
to set literally two seconds. Boom.

2626
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,920
Click and big reaction. Good support,
good reinforcements. What if you,

2627
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:50,790
you kind of needed some reinforcements
and it took just one click of a thing and

2628
02:41:50,850 --> 02:41:54,540
it brought just a full on reinforcement
into your situation. That's good, right?

2629
02:41:54,570 --> 02:41:56,760
Yeah. Small action.
Sounds good to me. Anyway,

2630
02:41:56,761 --> 02:42:01,280
that's what the Amazon Click through does
and that's how you do it. Good as junk.

2631

2637
02:42:25,051 --> 02:42:25,920
If you're in the mood,

2638
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:31,220
if you are moved by Jockos words
or echoes words or echoes words,

2639
02:42:33,570 --> 02:42:37,650
leave, review, see what up. I'm

2640
02:42:39,200 --> 02:42:42,270
also subscribed.
Subscribe to our Youtube Channel.

2641
02:42:42,271 --> 02:42:45,030
We have a youtube channel and all that.
People already know that

2642
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:48,820
and a lot of people have youtube channels.
Yeah.

2643
02:42:48,910 --> 02:42:52,810
How do you distinguish which ones are good
and which one's not good? Right. Well,

2644
02:42:52,811 --> 02:42:56,470
here's the good thing about subscribing
to youtube channels is you just click

2645
02:42:56,471 --> 02:43:00,640
subscribe and if I guess it, you know,
it shows the new videos in your feed,

2646
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:05,790
you can elect to have a notification or
not when you come up notification and it

2647
02:43:06,491 --> 02:43:09,850
doesn't annoy you because for something
to annoy you would have to happen a lot,

2648
02:43:10,270 --> 02:43:13,920
but since you don't,
a lot of videos I do actually,

2649
02:43:13,950 --> 02:43:18,520
it depends on what you mean by a lot, so
at least two weeks will be uploaded. Oh,

2650
02:43:18,550 --> 02:43:21,490
one will be the podcast. One
will be something else. I see.

2651
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:23,950
That is it that you just
threw down the gauntlet.

2652
02:43:24,790 --> 02:43:28,000
Now everyone's going to track your
beard. I know about do it. Hey,

2653
02:43:28,001 --> 02:43:30,910
if echo doesn't put up at least
two videos a week from here on out,

2654
02:43:31,150 --> 02:43:35,620
we can attack him on the
interwebs. Verbally, please.

2655
02:43:36,230 --> 02:43:40,180
Yeah, man. Hey. Ah, I'm
accountable. Yeah. Okay. Yeah,

2656
02:43:40,181 --> 02:43:43,540
you just made yourself accountable
so that's good where it is. But yes,

2657
02:43:43,541 --> 02:43:48,240
it was great. A little bit
better. Extreme OraSure anyway,

2658
02:43:48,250 --> 02:43:49,740
good thing about subscribing to youtube.

2659
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:52,370
You can just subscribe like anything else.
It's not like these,

2660
02:43:53,430 --> 02:43:56,500
you know these marketers and
email you stuff. It was like, hey,

2661
02:43:56,501 --> 02:43:57,830
unsubscribed you like

2662
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:03,120
chicken with from four years ago
and you're still emailing me.

2663
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:05,310
I didn't think it was good. Yeah. Stop.

2664
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:09,340
Why do I have the option to
unsubscribe to your email list one,

2665
02:44:09,341 --> 02:44:12,040
I didn't even subscribe to
it. Get away from this. Yeah,

2666
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:15,880
so it's not like that kind of where you
click unsubscribe and then the email you

2667
02:44:15,881 --> 02:44:20,740
again, by the way, this insisting confirm
we're sorry to see you go, why this,

2668
02:44:20,741 --> 02:44:23,190
why and then you've got to fill
out. It's not like that. And then,

2669
02:44:23,310 --> 02:44:27,880
and you will stop receiving email in six
to eight weeks. Yeah, some something.

2670
02:44:27,881 --> 02:44:31,150
Yeah. It's not like that
unsubscribed, done. Problem
solved. And then you can read,

2671
02:44:31,151 --> 02:44:32,830
subscribe. If you, it's totally up to you.

2672
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:37,480
Empower yourself on the subscribing
situation. That's youtube.

2673
02:44:38,430 --> 02:44:41,980
Um, so yeah, some videos on there.
We'll um, we'll try to keep you,

2674
02:44:42,880 --> 02:44:43,450
yeah,

2675
02:44:43,450 --> 02:44:48,010
somewhat occupied on there. It was good
anyway. And also Jocko has a store,

2676
02:44:48,040 --> 02:44:49,030
it's called Jocko store,

2677
02:44:49,570 --> 02:44:54,490
Jocko store.com if you wear shirts and
you want to represent that way I think,

2678
02:44:54,491 --> 02:44:57,190
and we're going to put some new
shirts on there, some new stuff.

2679
02:44:58,360 --> 02:44:59,141
You know what I did,

2680
02:44:59,141 --> 02:45:04,141
what we did really is people
will listen to you Jocko.

2681
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:08,560
I listened to you. But the
good thing about you is
actually, actually one of the,

2682
02:45:08,561 --> 02:45:12,100
one of the reasons that listen to you
is because he listened to me and you

2683
02:45:12,101 --> 02:45:15,760
listen to others, you know, we
visit the others. So people be like,

2684
02:45:15,790 --> 02:45:20,080
Hey Xyz,
make that into his shirt or you know,

2685
02:45:20,350 --> 02:45:23,650
hey you said make that into a shirt or
they'll just come up with their own thing,

2686
02:45:23,651 --> 02:45:26,050
you know, prioritize x out and
whatever and make it a shirt.

2687
02:45:26,051 --> 02:45:28,390
So during that listening.

2688
02:45:29,720 --> 02:45:30,360
Okay.

2689
02:45:30,360 --> 02:45:35,040
I kinda, we kinda just took it
to heart in a real general way.

2690
02:45:35,130 --> 02:45:39,960
And there's some new stuff. I like that.
Yeah. It's good. It's good options. Yeah.

2691
02:45:39,990 --> 02:45:44,370
But you can't, we can't make every shirt
that everything. No. And I just don't,

2692
02:45:44,670 --> 02:45:48,840
that wouldn't be practical.
No. Would it be, and some do.
I mean, I gotta be honest.

2693
02:45:49,370 --> 02:45:54,300
I say some cool stuff. Also say some dumb
stuff. Dumb stuff. Yeah. Or you know,

2694
02:45:54,301 --> 02:45:55,530
something that made be,

2695
02:45:55,531 --> 02:45:59,790
wouldn't translate onto a shirt that
someone would actually wear other than

2696
02:45:59,791 --> 02:46:01,050
maybe a handful of people.

2697
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:05,010
Then we'll just say some short ideas
and make more sense than others.

2698
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:09,060
We'll just say that. But
nonetheless, uh, we are,

2699
02:46:09,650 --> 02:46:13,310
and this is going to be a result of it
with some, you know, maybe some new stuff.

2700
02:46:14,090 --> 02:46:18,950
Oh, there's also some patches,
patches, the velcro ones and whatnot.

2701
02:46:19,210 --> 02:46:22,550
Um, hoodies, rash guards, performance.

2702
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:25,280
I think we do another
crash guard design as well.

2703
02:46:25,350 --> 02:46:28,550
Not going to get rid of the old
one. The old ones. The current ones.

2704
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:31,940
That one's dope to none. The
less, just more options. You know,

2705
02:46:31,970 --> 02:46:34,250
guys want to get after it
and have different looks,

2706
02:46:34,310 --> 02:46:37,970
maybe even have to in rotation that
looked different. Boom. So yeah,

2707
02:46:37,980 --> 02:46:39,320
we do that anyway.
All these things,

2708
02:46:39,321 --> 02:46:43,940
you can look at them if you like what you
see, one, two, three things, whatever,

2709
02:46:43,970 --> 02:46:48,860
however many things. Get it support that
way. Good way to support such a good way.

2710
02:46:48,861 --> 02:46:53,550
Yeah. Um, yeah. And, and
you're representing, so
it was kind of like, it's,

2711
02:46:53,551 --> 02:46:57,770
it's like an official way to kind
of just jump in the game, you know?

2712
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:03,070
You know what I mean? I
do. I saw, remember, um,

2713
02:47:03,170 --> 02:47:05,900
ah, I dunno if, yeah, you met
him, right? Yeah, that's Sam.

2714
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:10,670
He came in the gym and shaved head.
So he was just sitting there in the den,

2715
02:47:10,671 --> 02:47:14,120
in the lounge downstairs. I'm, I'm going
to get something to my car real quick.

2716
02:47:14,121 --> 02:47:17,480
I see. I see the shirt. Of
course I'm gonna say something.

2717
02:47:17,481 --> 02:47:19,460
But before I say anything,
I'm thinking in my mind,

2718
02:47:19,461 --> 02:47:22,900
look at this guy representing hard. And
the thing is, I don't know him. You know,

2719
02:47:23,430 --> 02:47:24,830
there's a guy I haven't met or whatever.

2720
02:47:24,831 --> 02:47:27,020
And you get that feeling
like that guy's representing.

2721
02:47:27,230 --> 02:47:29,030
And that's the feeling you get really,

2722
02:47:29,120 --> 02:47:32,570
you know when you see somebody in
the wild with it. Well, I actually,

2723
02:47:32,571 --> 02:47:36,620
speaking of that, I got a little story to
tell. Somebody hit me up and they said,

2724
02:47:36,621 --> 02:47:40,580
hey, I was out in the
wild, saw someone with uh,

2725
02:47:41,810 --> 02:47:43,970
with the Jocko podcast tee shirt on,

2726
02:47:44,570 --> 02:47:47,360
walked over to him through
the bone of fees on them.

2727
02:47:50,360 --> 02:47:55,340
Like you ever seen like a spy movie
where I come up and I say it is cold and

2728
02:47:55,341 --> 02:47:59,480
dark in the winter and the
person responds in March,

2729
02:47:59,510 --> 02:48:01,790
it will be warmer and now
we know we're going to go.

2730
02:48:02,090 --> 02:48:03,190
So what was the bone of fees?

2731
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:07,400
This dude walked up to the other dude
with a trooper tee shirt on and he said,

2732
02:48:08,210 --> 02:48:11,540
good evening. I go and
boom. They knew what was up.

2733
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:17,000
So I think that's become the official bone
of fees of Jocko podcast. Yeah. If you,

2734
02:48:17,060 --> 02:48:19,650
if you see someone who didn't
know wild well you know,

2735
02:48:19,651 --> 02:48:22,340
it might be a situation where
you can't just get crazy. Nope.

2736
02:48:22,430 --> 02:48:25,520
You just got to walk up and say
good evening echo and then they'll,

2737
02:48:25,670 --> 02:48:30,500
then you can do your burpees
and that.

2738
02:48:30,730 --> 02:48:33,670
That feeling is real though.
That feeling that I had when he,

2739
02:48:33,680 --> 02:48:36,110
when you see it it's like, ah, yeah.
You kind of know, you know. Anyway,

2740
02:48:36,111 --> 02:48:40,100
it's cool that way you'll have a
little added layer if you will.

2741
02:48:41,430 --> 02:48:45,740
Anyway. Also psychological warfare. If you
didn't know what psychological warfare,

2742
02:48:45,800 --> 02:48:46,850
this is what it is.

2743
02:48:46,970 --> 02:48:51,530
It's an album with tracks
and they're not music tracks.

2744
02:48:51,650 --> 02:48:54,350
They're not.
Jocko was hardcore band tracks.

2745
02:48:55,190 --> 02:48:57,440
Bronson's children's tracks.
It's not that.

2746
02:48:58,910 --> 02:49:00,350
What it is is little.

2747
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:04,670
They're not even excerpts cause they're
just loan tracks for specific things and

2748
02:49:04,671 --> 02:49:05,301
those things are,

2749
02:49:05,301 --> 02:49:09,540
if you're feeling weakness at any point
while you're trying to consistently get

2750
02:49:09,541 --> 02:49:09,961
after it,

2751
02:49:09,961 --> 02:49:14,961
wake up early or workout or
stick to your mental QRF.

2752
02:49:15,330 --> 02:49:19,470
Quick Reaction Force. Yeah. Weakness
in your, yeah, here we go. Boom.

2753
02:49:19,640 --> 02:49:22,860
Call the QRF. Who they are. I
kind of look at it as like a spot,

2754
02:49:23,400 --> 02:49:27,060
you know like when it goes to those
people that don't lift a spot is when

2755
02:49:27,061 --> 02:49:30,140
someone helps you lift whatever
weight you're trying to lift and,

2756
02:49:30,240 --> 02:49:34,050
and not to split hairs, but really it's
not necessarily there to help you. It's,

2757
02:49:34,051 --> 02:49:37,650
I mean ultimately a help general med.
Sure. You don't go down. Yes, exactly.

2758
02:49:37,651 --> 02:49:40,170
So they're sleeping.
If you want to really get after,

2759
02:49:40,180 --> 02:49:43,890
if I'm going to work every single day,
no days off one year,

2760
02:49:45,240 --> 02:49:47,150
big,
big tall order right there.

2761
02:49:47,170 --> 02:49:51,500
Just like if I'm going to
bench this 10,000 pounds, what?

2762
02:49:51,501 --> 02:49:53,040
I'm going to make two videos a week,

2763
02:49:55,920 --> 02:49:58,650
I would have bench more
than I've mentioned before,

2764
02:49:58,651 --> 02:50:01,080
but I'm going to go from
go from my one rep Max.

2765
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:03,780
It makes sense to have a spot.

2766
02:50:04,500 --> 02:50:08,880
You might get that one rep Max and not
need the spot, but it's there if you fail,

2767
02:50:08,910 --> 02:50:12,060
like if it's like too much or it feels
like too much with that guy, stand up,

2768
02:50:12,300 --> 02:50:14,880
just nudge you as much as you need.
That's really how,

2769
02:50:14,881 --> 02:50:18,330
this is just how I look at it.
Accurate. Yeah. Potentially right.

2770
02:50:19,460 --> 02:50:22,530
Based on what it is, is you put
the track on like, oh shoot,

2771
02:50:22,531 --> 02:50:26,400
I'm about to skip this workout. I'm about
to make this workout day a rest day.

2772
02:50:26,490 --> 02:50:29,430
No you're not. Yeah. You don't want
to do that. No. You can rest tomorrow,

2773
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:33,460
today at work or rest on the day that you
have scheduled for rest for really new

2774
02:50:33,480 --> 02:50:33,960
thing.

2775
02:50:33,960 --> 02:50:38,040
Don't just impromptu make it arrested
cause you feel like it's not how it works.

2776
02:50:38,310 --> 02:50:43,310
If you need a little spot in doing that,
you listened to a track called workout,

2777
02:50:43,320 --> 02:50:47,720
get workout. I don't know. One of
the workouts spots cause there's,

2778
02:50:47,780 --> 02:50:50,250
there's a couple for workout,
there's one for waking up.

2779
02:50:50,280 --> 02:50:52,980
There's three for waking up. Yeah. See.

2780
02:50:53,090 --> 02:50:55,710
And there's one for kind of
sticking to the Diet plan, you know,

2781
02:50:55,711 --> 02:50:57,900
like there's that kind of stuff and um,
yeah,

2782
02:50:57,901 --> 02:51:02,901
you put it on and there's one for getting
for forcing yourself through creative

2783
02:51:03,391 --> 02:51:07,990
blocks. Yeah. Right. Which kind of
sounds like impossible, but you know,

2784
02:51:08,030 --> 02:51:12,030
tell you who it's possible.
I would say,

2785
02:51:12,031 --> 02:51:17,020
I will say that this will get you
through it 100% of the time. Like I,

2786
02:51:18,030 --> 02:51:20,160
I'm trying to imagine the
feeling that you would,

2787
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:25,400
that would result in your heart if you
listen to this and you still skip the

2788
02:51:25,681 --> 02:51:28,640
workout thrall.
Yeah.

2789
02:51:29,140 --> 02:51:31,520
It's hard to fathom the
feeling you would have anyway.

2790
02:51:31,530 --> 02:51:34,600
It's very helpful and I'm
a real good spot, you know,

2791
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:36,990
and it's chocolate talking to you.
So he's like kind of there with you.

2792
02:51:36,991 --> 02:51:40,170
You know that guy you want there.
That's my opinion anyway.

2793
02:51:40,320 --> 02:51:43,710
It's called psychological warfare. It's
on iTunes. So if you just do a search,

2794
02:51:43,711 --> 02:51:47,250
psychological warfare, Jocko Willink,
get that you can support that way.

2795
02:51:47,251 --> 02:51:50,790
But this is one where this is
real good support for yourself.

2796
02:51:50,791 --> 02:51:55,340
Make it your ringtone. Wake up, wake
up, call, clear it with your wife first.

2797
02:51:55,670 --> 02:51:59,040
You could have some problems. Spouses
do not like. Yeah, that's a good one.

2798
02:51:59,130 --> 02:52:00,000
And it happened.

2799
02:52:00,360 --> 02:52:05,290
Happens to be number one still on iTunes.

2800
02:52:05,320 --> 02:52:06,153
That's awesome.
Yup.

2801
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:10,660
Since day one, by the way. Yes. That's,
thank you for the support and on that one.

2802
02:52:11,700 --> 02:52:15,730
Um, all right, while you're
on Amazon real quick,

2803
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:18,120
this is a couple of things
I have to cover. Um,

2804
02:52:18,190 --> 02:52:22,910
I've legally have to do this
Jocko white tea. We're, we're,

2805
02:52:22,950 --> 02:52:25,810
it looks like we're gonna have to go put
a warning on it cause there's a little

2806
02:52:25,811 --> 02:52:29,340
situation going on. Got a uh, uh, uh,

2807
02:52:29,380 --> 02:52:33,790
trooper hit me up on Twitter and
this is what he said. Warning,

2808
02:52:35,110 --> 02:52:38,410
I started drinking Jocko t
and the wife became pregnant,

2809
02:52:39,310 --> 02:52:40,143
should be on the label.

2810
02:52:40,150 --> 02:52:45,150
So he was also wondering if the child
would arrive as a brown belt in Jujitsu.

2811
02:52:47,410 --> 02:52:52,300
Now to be honest with you, we should
have tested this further. You know,

2812
02:52:52,301 --> 02:52:53,470
we should have tested this further.

2813
02:52:53,471 --> 02:52:58,471
We didn't and we aren't a hundred
percent sure if babies produced under the

2814
02:53:02,921 --> 02:53:05,800
influence of Jocko white
tea will be a brown belt.

2815
02:53:06,670 --> 02:53:11,670
They will be a purple belt minimum
but they might not be a brown belt but

2816
02:53:12,520 --> 02:53:13,840
fertility.
Yup.

2817
02:53:13,990 --> 02:53:18,990
It's confirmed prenatal Jujitsu skills
confirmed and confirmed to the level of

2818
02:53:21,101 --> 02:53:25,540
about 147%. So order
the t make it, drink it,

2819
02:53:25,541 --> 02:53:29,710
it tastes so good.
It tastes like victory.

2820
02:53:30,310 --> 02:53:32,110
So you can get that.
You can,

2821
02:53:33,190 --> 02:53:36,970
you can also preorder where
the warrior kid book. Now,

2822
02:53:37,150 --> 02:53:41,350
Uncle Jake is trying to explain
to mark what a warrior is,

2823
02:53:41,380 --> 02:53:46,380
so he gives him a notebook that
has various warrior codes in it.

2824
02:53:47,261 --> 02:53:49,810
He's got the ranger creed,
he's got the seal code,

2825
02:53:49,811 --> 02:53:51,940
he's got the marine core core values.

2826
02:53:51,941 --> 02:53:55,480
He's got the the seven virtues of Bushido,

2827
02:53:56,280 --> 02:53:59,950
the Samurai Code.
He's got the code of Chivalry for nights.

2828
02:54:01,030 --> 02:54:02,310
He's got the Viking laws.

2829
02:54:02,311 --> 02:54:06,040
We've got all these like war your codes
in there so that young mark knows what

2830
02:54:06,041 --> 02:54:09,520
is up and we should all,

2831
02:54:09,521 --> 02:54:14,080
we can all kind of need to know
what is up with some of them.

2832
02:54:14,290 --> 02:54:15,620
The Vikings,
you know,

2833
02:54:15,700 --> 02:54:18,220
you might not thank you might think
yourself out viking laws. What you know,

2834
02:54:18,221 --> 02:54:20,800
what kind of liking teach me,
why would I need to know if viking loss,

2835
02:54:21,220 --> 02:54:24,970
how could I possibly get anything? So you
get way the warrior kitty, you order it.

2836
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:26,710
You won't even start going
through the Viking laws.

2837
02:54:26,740 --> 02:54:29,440
Let me tell you what they say.
Viking laws,

2838
02:54:30,370 --> 02:54:33,730
be brave and aggressive.
Be Direct,

2839
02:54:33,770 --> 02:54:37,630
grab all opportunities,
use varying methods of attack.

2840
02:54:37,720 --> 02:54:42,070
Be Versatile and I agile
attack one target at a time.

2841
02:54:42,370 --> 02:54:46,930
Don't plan everything in detail.
Use Top quality weapons.

2842
02:54:47,530 --> 02:54:51,310
Be prepared. Keep weapons in
good condition. Keep in shape.

2843
02:54:51,340 --> 02:54:53,860
Find good battle comrades.

2844
02:54:54,070 --> 02:54:56,350
Agree on important points.

2845
02:54:57,370 --> 02:55:01,480
Choose one chief,
be a good merchant.

2846
02:55:02,050 --> 02:55:04,790
Find out what the market needs.

2847
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:08,150
Do not promise what you can't keep.

2848
02:55:09,590 --> 02:55:14,590
Do not demand overpayment arranged
things so that you can return.

2849
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:19,170
Keep the camp in good order.

2850
02:55:20,210 --> 02:55:20,680
Okay.

2851
02:55:20,680 --> 02:55:22,960
Keep things tidy and organized,

2852
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:27,040
arranged enjoyable activities
that strengthen the group.

2853
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:30,160
Make sure everybody does useful work.

2854
02:55:30,850 --> 02:55:34,840
Consult all members of
the group for advice.

2855
02:55:35,710 --> 02:55:38,680
Hey, this viking laws, 1200 years old,

2856
02:55:39,010 --> 02:55:42,040
is there anything you might be able
to get out of that? Yes, absolutely.

2857
02:55:42,041 --> 02:55:44,590
We can all take something away from that.
So

2858
02:55:46,330 --> 02:55:49,570
bunch of warrior codes in
there and by the way, mark,

2859
02:55:49,660 --> 02:55:53,530
he ends up writing his own
war. Your kid code. Yeah. Yeah.

2860
02:55:54,280 --> 02:55:58,970
Kind of kid code that I wish I would have
lived by. You know what I'm saying? Yes.

2861
02:55:59,290 --> 02:56:03,010
It's going to help some people out.
Also just released.

2862
02:56:03,011 --> 02:56:05,080
We got the discipline equals
freedom field manual coming.

2863
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:06,760
This is what you were asking for a book.

2864
02:56:07,290 --> 02:56:11,470
It pretty much represents what we
talk about this on this podcast.

2865
02:56:11,500 --> 02:56:12,730
Faults and action.

2866
02:56:12,731 --> 02:56:16,720
The thoughts are aligned with
what you hear on this podcast.

2867
02:56:16,721 --> 02:56:20,680
The actions are more detailed than what
I say on the podcast. More granular,

2868
02:56:20,830 --> 02:56:24,130
more specific workouts of food intake,
martial arts.

2869
02:56:24,131 --> 02:56:28,720
So disappointing because field
discipline equals freedom field manual.

2870
02:56:28,750 --> 02:56:29,710
You can get some of that.

2871
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:34,870
You can also pick up a couple of
copies of extreme ownership of course.

2872
02:56:35,930 --> 02:56:36,230
Okay.

2873
02:56:36,230 --> 02:56:39,290
Lessons of combat leadership that
we talk about on this podcast.

2874
02:56:39,291 --> 02:56:44,291
By the way from Henry the fifth to HR
McMaster spans a pretty good time and

2875
02:56:46,401 --> 02:56:51,220
those lessons of combat
leadership translate to
business and life and the laid

2876
02:56:51,221 --> 02:56:54,560
out in extreme ownership
very simply and very clearly.

2877
02:56:54,800 --> 02:56:59,180
So what you do is you order one for you
and then you order one for everyone in

2878
02:56:59,181 --> 02:57:03,980
your chain of command up
and down, get some monster,

2879
02:57:04,250 --> 02:57:08,900
May 4th and fifth the New York
City Marriott Marquis Register now,

of leadership training, leadership,

2882

2914
02:59:22,050 --> 02:59:22,640
Okay.

2915
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:27,640
Leaders and front line sled dogs.

2916
02:59:29,580 --> 02:59:34,200
Thanks to all of you for
taking ownership of your life,

2917
02:59:34,260 --> 02:59:39,260
for being the discipline and for
getting out there into the world with a

2918
02:59:39,841 --> 02:59:43,050
clenched jaw in a furrowed brow.

2919
02:59:44,040 --> 02:59:44,873
Okay.

2920
02:59:45,050 --> 02:59:46,010
And getting after it.

2921
02:59:48,560 --> 02:59:53,300
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2922
02:59:54,690 --> 02:59:54,950
out.
