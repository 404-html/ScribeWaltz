1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,770
I've heard it called
a death letter.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,300
Yeah,

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,690
but I don't know if
that is the actual name.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:16,270
I don't know if it has an actual name,

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,250
but I do know what it is.

6
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,720
It is something that soldiers sometimes,

7
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:32,170
right when they deploy into harms way.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,563
Okay.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,650
Then they put it with your gear or in
a foot locker where it will be found or

10
00:00:41,801 --> 00:00:44,440
they give it to a friend to pass on

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,340
in case they die.

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,190
Okay.

13
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,740
A letter to the family.

14
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,530
They won't see you again.

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:00:59,810
Okay.

16
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:03,830
To mothers that gave them life
to fathers that raised them

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,980
to wives
that they left at home

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,560
to children they miss and in
some cases to the children

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,190
they've never even met.

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,103
Okay.

21
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,990
It's a good by letter

22
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,380
with the title.

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,420
Something like in case I don't come home.

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,300
Well,
Jesse givens

25
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,750
of Springfield, Missouri
wrote one of those letters.

26
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,680
He wrote it to his wife
Melissa and their son, Dakota

27
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,470
nickname toad

28
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,500
and to their unborn son,
nickname bean,

29
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,650
who would ultimately be named Carson.

30
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,680
And here is what he said
in that letter

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,070
in case he didn't come home.

32
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,733
My family.

33
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,000
I never thought I would be
writing a letter like this.

34
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,400
I really don't know where to start.

35
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,210
I've been getting bad
feelings though and well,

36
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,700
if you're reading this,

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:02,020
I am forever in to you,
Dakota and the bean.

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,840
I searched all my life for a
dream and I found it in you.

39
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,140
Okay?

40
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,040
I would like to think that I made a
positive difference in your lives.

41
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,270
I will never be able
to make up for the bad.

42
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,580
I am so sorry.

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,680
The happiest moments in my life
all deal with my little family.

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,020
I will always have with me the
small moments we all shared.

45
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,420
Yeah.

46
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,420
The moments when you quit taking
life so seriously and smiled.

47
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,200
The sounds of a beautiful boys laughter

48
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,860
or the simple nudge of a baby unborn.

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You will never know how complete you
have made me each and every one of you.

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,130
You saved me from loneliness and
taught me how to think beyond myself.

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,830
You taught me how to live and to love.

52
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,610
You opened my eyes to a world
I never dreamed existed.

53
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,283
Yeah.

54
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,780
All right.
I'm proud of you.

55
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,410
Stay on the path you choose.

56
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,400
Never lose sight of what is important.

57
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,280
You and our babies,

58
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,243
Dakota,

59
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,260
you are more sun than
I could ever ask for.

60
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,960
I can only hope I was half the dad.

61
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,050
I used to be your Danny,
but no matter what,

62
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,270
it makes me proud that you chose me.

63
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,470
You taught me how to care until it hurts.
You've taught me how to smile again.

64
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,100
Yeah,

65
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,820
you taught me that life isn't so
serious and sometimes you have to play.

66
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,040
You have a big beautiful heart
through life.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,350
You need to keep it open and follow it.

68
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,840
Never be afraid to be yourself.

69
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,120
I will always be there in our park
when you dream so we can still play.

70
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,770
I hope someday you will
have a son like mine.

71
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,490
Make them smile and shine just like you.

72
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,223
Okay.

73
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,780
I love you towed and I hope someday you
will understand why I didn't come home.

74
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,950
Please be proud of me.

75
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,870
Please don't stop loving life.

76
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,210
Yeah,

77
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,090
take in every breath like it's your first.

78
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,810
Yeah.

79
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,320
I love you towed.
I will always be there with you.

80
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll be in the sun shadows,

81
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,380
dreams and joys of your life.

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,920
Okay,

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,800
baby.
Been,

84
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,323
yeah,

85
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,960
I never got to see you,
but I know in my heart you are beautiful.

86
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:46,310
I know you will be strong and big
hearted just like your mom and brother.

87
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,400
I will always have with me the fuel of
the soft nudge is on your mom's belly and

88
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:59,810
the joy I felt when we found
out you were on your way.

89
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,573
Yeah.

90
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,800
Hi, dream of you every
night. I always will.

91
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,450
Don't ever think that since I wasn't
around that I didn't love you.

92
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,400
Okay.

93
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,200
You were conceived of love and I
came to this terrible place for love.

94
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,170
I love you as I do your mom and
brother with all my heart and soul.

95
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,030
Please understand that I had to be gone
so that I could take care of my family.

96
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,820
I love you being,

97
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
I have never been so blessed
as the day I met Melissa.

98
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:47,990
Okay.

99
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,670
You are my angel, Soul Mate, wife, lover,

100
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,320
and best friend.

101
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,510
I am sorry.

102
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,150
I did not want to have
to write this letter.

103
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,420
Okay.

104
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,390
There is so much more I
need to say so much more.

105
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:12,090
I need to share a lifetime's worth.

106
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,600
I married you for a million lifetimes.

107
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,233
Yeah,

108
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,940
that's how long I will be with you.

109
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,350
Please keep our babies safe.

110
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,320
Please find it in your heart to
forgive me for leaving you alone.

111
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:40,780
Take care of yourself. Believe
in yourself. You are a strong,

112
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,980
big hearted woman.

113
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:49,110
Teach our babies to live life to its
fullest and tell yourself to do the same.

114
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,930
Don't forget to take PTO to Disneyworld.

115
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,900
I'll be there with you.
Melissa,

116
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,970
I will always want you,
need you and love you in my heart,

117
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,470
mind and soul.

118
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,030
Do me a favor.

119
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,630
After you talk towed in Benin,

120
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,850
give them hugs and kisses from me.

121
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,580
Go outside,
look at the stars and count them.

122
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,210
Don't forget to smile.

123
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,140
Love always your husband,
Jess

124
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,260
and Jessie
didn't come home

125
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:58,851
on May.

126
00:09:58,851 --> 00:10:03,851
First 2003 Jesse givens was killed while
conducting combat operations in Hominy,

127
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,183
Iraq.

128
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,900
When is Abrams tank plunged
into the Euphrates river?

129
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,640
After the bank along the river collapsed,

130
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,780
the three other crew members
made it out of the tank.

131
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,360
Jesse did not.

132
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,720
Oh,
another

133
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,040
brave warrior

134
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,613
garden

135
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,060
like so many other warriors.

136
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,630
He left behind a family,
a wife,

137
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,100
and children,

138
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,990
and the mother and father
and friends and life

139
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,190
you have behind everything.

140
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,560
Every smile, every laugh,
every hug from his boys,

141
00:11:20,561 --> 00:11:23,090
every kiss from his wife,
everything.

142
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,273
Go ahead.

143
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,000
And on this Memorial Day,

144
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,910
let us remember.

145
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,290
Let us remember those soldiers,
sailors,

146
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,300
airmen,
and marines,

147
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,870
those brave warriors who for us,

148
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,090
for our freedom,

149
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,040
left everything behind.

150
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,770
And after the sun sets
on this memorial day

151
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,440
and darkness consumes the sky,

152
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,980
go outside.

153
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,683
Yeah.

154
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,733
And look up,

155
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,573
okay.

156
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,130
And say thank you

157
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,380
to those heroes that
now grace the heavens.

158
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,663
Okay.

159
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,320
And then look at the stars.
Count them.

160
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,820
And as much as your soul
aches with sadness as you,

161
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,580
more your fallen family

162
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,090
and friends
and brothers and arms,

163
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,670
don't forget that they did not sacrifice
their lives for us to live in sadness.

164
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,213
No.

165
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,883
Okay.

166
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,940
They sacrificed their lives so we
could leave in joy and happiness.

167
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,003
So

168
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,260
even on this most solemn day,

169
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,900
Memorial Day,

170
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,600
don't forget
for them

171
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,380
to smile.
