1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,370
Pomegranate, what does it, pomegranate,
Chai tea. White tea. Yep. That's what I,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,600
and so when you're deep,
deep. So action. Action.

3
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:11,583
All right.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,220
This right here is the
first Jocko podcast.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,670
Here we go.
I guess to start off,

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,120
how did we end up here?
How did this happen?

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,580
I guess I have to thank Tim Ferris four
initially having me on to his podcast

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,030
and that was via

9
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,860
a couple people that helped me
out. Get on there. Kirk Parsley,

10
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,403
Peter Attia,

11
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,870
and they made some introductions
and introduced me to Tim Ferris.

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:00,880
Tim had me on,
got a lot of good feedback on that,

13
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,080
on that show.

14
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,460
And that led to me going on to Joe Rogan.

15
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,710
So thanks to Joe Rogan
for having me on as well.

16
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,210
And once those two things happened and I
actually got online and started getting

17
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:23,190
communicating with other human
beings online and they were asking,

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,690
you know,
you should,

19
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,720
you should do a podcast because it was
interesting and both Joe and Tim told me

20
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:36,850
to have a podcast because
it was interesting. So as

21
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,950
I got all that feedback,
which was awesome, um,

22
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,650
I kind of realized I should do a podcast.
So I'm sitting here,

23
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,480
my name is Jocko Jocko Willink. I was
uh, if you don't know anything about me,

24
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,540
I served 20 years in the military,
retired

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,130
in 2010 myself and one of my buddies,

26
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,730
guy by the name of Leif Babin,
we started a company where we

27
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,080
do leadership and management
consulting for businesses.

28
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,030
Doing all that work eventually got us to
a situation where we had some knowledge

29
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:20,320
and kind of aggregated some knowledge
and so we put that into a book.

30
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:23,950
The book came out and
been doing pretty well.

31
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,330
It's called extreme ownership.

32
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,980
So that's who I am now.
I kind of

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,360
sometimes find it a little
strange just to be talking.

34
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,740
And so as we decided to
put this podcast together,

35
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,400
at one point I had done some follow up
videos for Tim Ferris for him to put

36
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:48,790
online and I did those with a buddy
of mine who sit in here with me now,

37
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,190
guy by the name of Echo Charles,

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,450
who is a longtime Jujitsu
training partner of mine.

39
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,890
And he does video production.

40
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,320
He's got a company called flex point TV.
Uh,

41
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,870
and whenever I got to do
something video related,

42
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,440
he's my go to guy.
And so when this came,

43
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,130
this opportunity came about when we were
filming the videos for Tim Ferriss and

44
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:20,020
we had questions from the Internet and
we were sitting there and he's filming

45
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,350
and we were basically doing a podcast
cause we were talking and we were having

46
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,940
conversations about leadership and about
Jujitsu and about problems and about

47
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,803
everything.

48
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,900
And that kind of rolled
into when we started talking
about doing a podcast and I

49
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,280
said, Hey, do you have audio equipment?

50
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,480
Do you have a recorder?
Do you have,

51
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,030
do you have time to sit down and
hang out with me and, and do this?

52
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,600
And I do. He said, I do.

53
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,620
I do have all that stuff and
here we are. So then, uh,

54
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,400
what we did was we,
we took a bunch of

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,930
questions that I got from online.

56
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,360
People hit me with all kinds of
different questions, which is awesome.

57
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,870
Thanks to everybody for giving me that
feedback and listening and talking and

58
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:12,280
communicating with me.
That's awesome.

59
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,440
It's kind of weird because I've never
been like the most social person in the

60
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,880
world and

61
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,680
not that I feel like lonely
cause I never do. I'm,

62
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,070
I don't care if I'm alone or not.
It's no big deal usually.

63
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:30,100
You mean like online social? Definitely,
definitely not online social.

64
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:35,101
I mean I had zero online presence prior
to being on the Tim Ferriss podcast and

65
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,723
mmm.

66
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,520
But, but even socially, I mean, I
don't like hanging around with people.

67
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,354
You know that every night.

68
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,630
I told you that like the last time
I was over here I said, hey, yeah,

69
00:04:47,631 --> 00:04:48,680
I just don't do that a lot.

70
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,780
So it's kind of interesting to me being
online and communicating with really

71
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:56,720
thousands of people and they all,

72
00:04:56,721 --> 00:05:00,350
and it's cool because I'm not used to
having people that are kind of interested

73
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,050
in the same thing I'm interested in,
you know?

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,910
Did you get to the working
out the wanting to do better.

75
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:08,150
They'll want to get better. The
want to learn more. That's what I'm,

76
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,260
that's what I want to do.

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,650
And it's cool to be able to communicate
with a bunch of people that want to do

78
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:17,540
the same thing. And you know, I
think that's what this podcast,

79
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,290
which I know is going to evolve
into all kinds of different things.

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,970
But I think the,

81
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,890
the underlying theme
will be lessons learned.

82
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,180
You know, lessons learned. I want to
learn from people. I want people to,

83
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:34,040
I want to pass on what I've learned.

84
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,490
I don't want people to make
the same mistakes I made.

85
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,560
I want to learn other mistakes that
people have made so I don't make them.

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,830
And I think that's going to kind
of be the underlying theme here

87
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,040
with this. Yeah. What about you?

88
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:52,581
I mean,

89
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:57,581
is there any thing and your background
that you would consider to be important

90
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,970
for people to know

91
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,280
above and beyond what you
just said? No, I think that's,

92
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,720
those are the relevant points for sure.

93
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,610
That's, that's, that's as
we talked about doing this,

94
00:06:13,611 --> 00:06:18,611
that's one of the things that
struck me as you're a director,

95
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,660
you know, for Your
Business, right? You're,

96
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:23,120
you're a film director and you
don't get in front of the camera.

97
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:24,710
That's not your thing.
Right.

98
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,810
And so that's why I think this
interaction is good because you're,

99
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:33,520
you're drawing things out of
people. That's what a director
does. Yeah. You're not,

100
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,020
I believe that's where you're
going to be doing here. Yeah. Yes.

101
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,910
Especially when I did a lot of the
metamorris stuff, that was essentially my,

102
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,830
I was like maybe a third of the
whole job if she gets stuff. How to,

103
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,000
so the Jujitsu players out there,

104
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:51,550
if you follow metamorris at all the
videos that the, what do they call it?

105
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,900
Lead up videos, like promo promo
videos for the matches. Yeah.

106
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,060
Those were Downes Downes that's right.
Those were,

107
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:02,170
those were Echo Charles
material right there. Yeah.

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,360
So you'd occasionally hear his voice in
the background with a question. Yeah.

109
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,750
So speaking to questions. Yeah. We
got some questions from the, uh,

110
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,910
from the interwebs when we got
for the first one. Here we go.

111
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,570
First question is,
why do you wake up early in the morning?

112
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,280
Actually, this is, I kind of have the
same question because I wake up late.
