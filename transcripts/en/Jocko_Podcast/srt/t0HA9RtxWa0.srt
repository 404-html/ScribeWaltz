00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,460
This is Jocko podcast number
78 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,770
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,420
Nightmare.

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,910
Now that's a word that I use oftentimes
to describe the most horrible things in

5
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:28,810
a most wretched things.
And in my hierarchy of adjectives,

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,890
nightmare is right alongside of hell.

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,350
Okay?

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,740
And I'm not sure which
one is worse in my mind.

9
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:46,741
That's why I say they're right alongside
each other because hell is beyond the

10
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:49,360
worst thing your mind can imagine.

11
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,420
And that's basically what a nightmare is
when you're asleep and your mind delves

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,560
into the most horrific things beyond
what you can consciously and willfully

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,710
imagine in your own head.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,630
That's what a nightmare is.
Now, what if there was a place

15
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:20,020
that was worse than a nightmare?

16
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,393
Yeah,

17
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:23,690
and it was a real place.

18
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,680
Who could create

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,530
such a place?

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,450
And the answer to that is we can,

21
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,980
I shall never forget how I was roused
one night by the groans of a fellow

22
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,830
prisoner who threw
himself about his sleep.

23
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:54,920
Obviously having a horrible nightmare

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,700
since I had always been,

25
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:02,780
especially sorry for people who
suffer from fearful dreams or Deliria.

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,520
I wanted to wake the poor man.
Suddenly I drew back the hand,

27
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:11,360
which was ready to shake him,
frightened at the thing I was about to do.

28
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,450
At that moment,
I became intensely,

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,740
intensely conscious of
the fact that no dream,

30
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
no matter how horrible,

31
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,010
could be as bad as the
reality of the camp,

32
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,040
which surrounded us and to
which I was about to recall him.

33
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:39,070
And that's a quote from the book man's
search for meaning by Viktor Frankl,

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,320
which will be

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,500
peering into today and it's a book
about the Nazi concentration camps,

36
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,350
which
are really,

37
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,090
as he pointed out there,
worse than any nightmare we can.

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Here's a holocaust survivor,

39
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,740
Edie Weinstein on the death
and the atrocities in Treblinka

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,670
by now, the transports were coming
every day. One was much like the next,

41
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,900
the same incidents recurred
again and again once.

42
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,240
As I swept out the interior of a car,

43
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,910
an ss man suddenly struck
me with his weapon,

44
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:33,410
ordered me to help a woman who was
unable to stand and climb out of the car.

45
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,990
The idea was to show his victims how
well the ill we're being treated.

46
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,650
Then he ordered one of the
workers to take the women,

47
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,300
take the woman to have the field,
the field hospital for care.

48
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,360
The newcomers are really believed that
the alien alien woman would be taken to

49
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:54,194
an infirmary.

50
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,110
None of them realized that the field
hospital was in fact just a giant pit,

51
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,670
about 30 yards in diameter,
which was always a blaze.

52
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,930
They would place those who were sick or
disabled on the ground at the edge of

53
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:16,331
the pit facing in the ss man and the in
charge circulated among them and shot

54
00:04:17,361 --> 00:04:21,560
them in the back of the neck.
Then the workers cast them into the pit.

55
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,210
Some of the victims were still breathing
when they were tossed in with the other

56
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:27,044
bodies.

57
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,440
The pit was separated from the spacious
field by a barrier of fresh pine

58
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:34,344
branches,

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,640
which were replaced from time to time
to conceal the infirmary from the

60
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,710
newcomers until the last moment,

61
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,570
20 minutes after I helped the woman
climb out of the railroad car.

62
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,870
I was told that some infants were sitting
by the pit and no one else was there

63
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:54,180
because the SS soldier
had taken his lunch break.

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,660
I gathered some trash and went over there.

65
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,070
I saw the woman who I had removed
from the car, still breathing,

66
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,700
sitting at the edge of the pit and
staring in fright into the burning inferno

67
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,140
and its contents,

68
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,280
the half cremated bodies of old people
and children mixed with smoldering trash.

69
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,340
She tried to stand up,
but her legs would not hold her.

70
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,140
She looked at the workers
who stirred the embers,

71
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,740
remnants of human beings
so they would burn better

72
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,260
nearby were about a dozen infants to
young to have learned how to walk.

73
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,800
They were not crying. They certainly
did not understand what was happening.

74
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,710
They looked about almost certainly in
hopes of finding their mother or Father

75
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,950
Bader. I heard that right after
he returned from his lunch break,

76
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:56,180
the ss man shot them all in order the
workers to throw the tiny bodies into the

77
00:05:56,181 --> 00:05:57,014
flames.

78
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,160
Of all my memories of
that occur said place.

79
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:06,300
The vision of these babies
is undoubtedly the worst.

80
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,010
I see their faces whenever
I remember Treblinka.

81
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,370
As I write these lines more
than 50 years after that day,

82
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,330
I still cannot overcome the horror.

83
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,373
Okay.

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,180
Eight another report here.
Martin spat of Tar.

85
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:37,181
Now Poland describes the massacre
of Tarnow Jews in an interview.

86
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,600
Okay.

87
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,080
We heard the columns of Jews
under the German escort at night.

88
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,790
It was going constantly.

89
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:46,860
Okay.

90
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,060
They were passing our house because
this was already on the outskirts of the

91
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:54,990
city, the cemetery, and they were marching
them to the woods behind the city.

92
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:59,460
As we found out later,
they were all shot over there

93
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,090
during the day. I looked out through
the shingles. My father said,

94
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:08,710
I shouldn't look, but anyway,
I was a kid. I was curious.

95
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,390
And the roof was overlooking the
cemetery and wagons with bodies.

96
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,960
Dead bodies were coming in groups.

97
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,560
They were bringing in groups of Jewish
people that had to dig trenches.

98
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,800
They had to dig ditches
and the body's dumped in.

99
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,250
And after those Jews that dug the ditches,

100
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:35,420
they were shot also and pushed in by
another group that came in after them into

101
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:40,680
those ditches and lime was poured over
the bodies and the next group covered up

102
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:43,290
those ditches and Doug,
other ditches

103
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,690
they brought in.

104
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,280
Okay.

105
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,180
Pregnant women.

106
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,010
Okay.

107
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,690
And they didn't use any bullets.

108
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,580
They used bayonets,

109
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,600
the screams of the mothers,
that their children,

110
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,990
they tore their children out of their arms

111
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,910
and the screams of the children.
I still here

112
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,880
and Solomon [inaudible],
who is the only survivor

113
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,490
from the 78 people in his family

114
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:43,490
described the concentration camp.

115
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,420
They throw the people in the crematoriums,
the children,

116
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,060
I will never forget alive.

117
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,313
Yeah,

118
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,010
they throw them in the crematoriums.

119
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,590
They grabbed by an arm,

120
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,550
by a leg by the head and
throw them into the ovens

121
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,410
there.
It was so tragic.

122
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,930
The cries and people when crying there,
you know,

123
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,630
it was so terrible.
I can feel it now.

124
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,300
I can even see the people.

125
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,860
The other people were crying. The children
were hollering, Mama, daddy helped me.

126
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,120
Mama Daddy helped me.

127
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,953
Okay.

128
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,470
It was terrible.

129
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,740
And one more report or
Treblinka from Henry Gold.

130
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,910
And the worst thing that happens
to a person in that instance,

131
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,760
he loses self respect.

132
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,640
And that's exactly what happened
to the majority of the people.

133
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,870
Some of them even lost their minds.
They couldn't take it.

134
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,620
They couldn't take the hunger.
They couldn't take the beatings,

135
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,250
they couldn't take the cold.
No clothing and the uncertainty

136
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,970
and the uncertainty.

137
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,270
I think that was the worst thing that
can happen to a person you didn't know

138
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:22,760
from one moment to the next
what was going to happen.

139
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,300
Okay.

140
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,980
Life was very cheap. A person was alive
one minute, the next minute he was shot,

141
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,680
killed, beaten up, beaten to death,

142
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,500
torn apart by dogs and so on.

143
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,980
Life was very, very cheap and
that's the way the Germans liked it.

144
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:48,020
That particular camp was governed by
the Jewish Jewish police and so on.

145
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,410
The Germans did not stay in the camp.
They were on the outside,

146
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,440
but the life inside of the camp was just
as bad without the Germans being right

147
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:00,840
there.
Then if they would be,

148
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,480
the Jewish police was,
I don't know,

149
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,150
you take a person in that situation
and you give them a little power and he

150
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:14,820
becomes the same as the oppressor himself.

151
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,300
Okay.

152
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,400
There were some policemen
that were not bad,

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,970
but there were a lot of
them that were ruthless.

154
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,220
There were others that would beat people
and do all kinds of things that would

155
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:31,160
degrade them and so on.
Especially women.

156
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,000
They cut their hair off
and they look like men,

157
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,830
they look like scarecrows and they would
get beaten up by the Jewish police just

158
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,990
as bad as the man for no reason at all.

159
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,850
If they want it a little more soup

160
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,500
where they were distributing soup and
there was some left and they were going to

161
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:56,501
give everybody a little and the Jewish
police with their sticks and rubber hoses

162
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,990
would beat them half cents senseless

163
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,710
and that's what happens when the
conditions are the way they were.

164
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:11,711
Then when a person becomes an animal and
loses self respect that is willing to

165
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:17,180
get a beating and get beaten
half senseless just to
get a little bit of soup.

166
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,730
Either you died
or if you didn't die,

167
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,530
the Germans would come and take you away.

168
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,750
The filth was just terrible. In the
camp, in the barracks you had cots,

169
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,370
I mean bunks where everybody
slept on Straw. There were
no covers was no pillows,

170
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:39,204
nothing.

171
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,830
You slept in your clothes and the winners
in the winter because you're afraid to

172
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:48,510
get cold. The only heating
was a pot bellied stove in
the middle of the barrack.

173
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,040
When somebody stole some wood in the
factory or something, then we had a fire.

174
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,270
Otherwise it was freezing

175
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,840
and the only warmth they had if you
huddled together and they kept warm that

176
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:05,230
way,
but nobody would get undressed.

177
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,840
The lice were eating you up alive once a
month you were allowed to take a shower

178
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,870
and we had to walk to camp a to go to the
showers and that means a 10 mile walk,

179
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,020
10 miles there and 10 miles back.

180
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,760
A lot of people were too weak to walk and
those people hardly ever took a shower.

181
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,430
There was no hot water in the washroom.
It was only cold.

182
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,730
And in the winter you are afraid to wash
up because there was nothing to wipe

183
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,990
yourself with.

184
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,820
Therefore you would walk out in the
cold winter and freeze to death.

185
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,460
Dan Henry Gold brothers and both of
his parents were all killed in the gas

186
00:13:56,751 --> 00:13:57,584
chambers.

187
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,623
Yeah.

188
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,600
And from the boot can Wald report,

189
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,920
which was translated and edited with
an introduction by David a Hackett.

190
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,100
I will now describe the crematoriums
and the transports at the station.

191
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:22,090
2000 people got off the trains.
They had to throw away all their luggage.

192
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:23,980
Afterward,

193
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,910
the men and women were divided into two
groups at which the larger boys were

194
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,410
assigned to the group with the men.

195
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:36,740
Then that great devour of Jews Mengele
drove by in a car seeking out the

196
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,330
strongest from each transport.

197
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,140
They numbered around 30 out of 2000 the
remainder were led away by ss technical

198
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:47,700
sergeant mole.

199
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,190
Okay.

200
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,050
The officer of the crematorium,
the elderly,

201
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:56,410
were loaded onto dump trucks and then
dumped into burning trenches while still

202
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:57,244
alive.

203
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,080
The remainder will lead to
the gas chambers. Meanwhile,

204
00:15:04,081 --> 00:15:05,610
new transports were arriving

205
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,500
in front of the gas
chamber was a dressing room

206
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,170
on its walls,
was written in all languages,

207
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:17,920
put shoes into the cubby holes and tie
them together so you will not lose them

208
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:22,030
after the showers,
you will receive hot coffee

209
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,770
here. Poor victims undressed
themselves and when to the chamber,

210
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,320
there were three columns for the
ventilators through which the gas port in

211
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,820
a special work detail with truncheons
drove the people into the chamber.

212
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:44,980
When the room was full, small children
would thrown in through a window.

213
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,930
Sergeant mole grabbed infants by their
legs and smash their skulls against the

214
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:56,500
wall.
Then the gas was led into the chamber.

215
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,440
The lungs of the victim slowly burst and
after three minutes allowed clamoring

216
00:16:02,441 --> 00:16:03,274
could be heard.

217
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:10,190
Then the chamber was open and those who
still showed signs of life were beaten

218
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:11,034
to death.

219
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:21,450
The prisoners of the special work
details then pulled corpses out,

220
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,260
took the rings off and cut their hair,
which was gathered up,

221
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,270
put in Saks and shipped to factories.

222
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,020
Then they arranged the
corpses in piles of 10 each

223
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,120
after sergeant mole had counted them,

224
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:40,620
they were taken to the ovens or if
the crematoriums crematoriums were

225
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,260
insufficient,
thrown into fire trenches.

226
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,570
Once it happened that a victim
crawled out of a burning trench,

227
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,760
he was beaten to death with truncheons.

228
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,370
Once sergeant mole pole put a naked
woman in the trench and shot her in the

229
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,204
genitals.

230
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,830
Another time mole found a ring on a
member of the special work detail.

231
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,090
He ordered nat NAPFA,
poured over him and had it lighted.

232
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,060
He hanged a man by his hands and shot
him until his arms were torn through.

233
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,270
Then he hanged them up by the
feet and repeated the process,

234
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,240
wants sergeant mold,
took a family of six.

235
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,730
First he shot the youngest
in the presence of the rest.

236
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,700
Then he shot the older ones and finally

237
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,390
their father and mother.

238
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,200
Then that's the testimony of John de Weiss

239
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,620
who was 15 years old
at Birkenau.

240
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,650
So I think it's safe to say that

241
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:12,840
this is a situation that is
definitely worse than a nightmare

242
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,000
and

243
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,540
what possibly can we take away from that?

244
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,070
I think the best thing we can do

245
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,670
is try and learn,

246
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,720
and I think one of the best places to
learn and take lessons away from the

247
00:18:41,241 --> 00:18:46,241
Holocaust is from the book that I started
out with today called man's search for

248
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:48,260
meaning by Viktor Frankl.

249
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:52,953
Okay,

250
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,400
let's go to the book.

251
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,770
Let us take the case of a transport which
was officially announced to transfer a

252
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,020
certain number of
prisoners to another camp,

253
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,160
but it was fairly safe to guests that
it's final destination would be the gas

254
00:19:13,161 --> 00:19:17,480
chambers.
A selection of sick or feeble prisoners.

255
00:19:17,481 --> 00:19:21,770
Incapable of work would be sent to one
of the big central camps which were

256
00:19:21,771 --> 00:19:23,960
fitted with gas chambers and crematoriums.

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The selection process was the signal for
a free fight among all the prisoners or

258
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,940
of group against group.

259
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,770
All that mattered was that one's own
name and that of one's friends or crossed

260
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:46,940
off the list of victims. Though
everyone knew that for each man saved,

261
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,010
another victim had to be found.

262
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,710
A definite number of prisoners
had to go with each transport.

263
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,010
It did not really matter which since
each of them was nothing but a number

264
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,980
on their admission to the camp,

265
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,830
all their documents had been taken from
them together with other possessions.

266
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,880
Each prisoner therefore had an
opportunity to claim a fictitious name or

267
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,610
profession and for various reasons,
many did this.

268
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,650
The authorities were interested
only in the captives numbers.

269
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,020
These numbers were often tattooed on
their skin and also had to be sewn to a

270
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,630
certain spot on their
trousers, jacket, or coat.

271
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,150
Any guard who wanted to make a charge
against a prisoner just glanced at his

272
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:39,350
number
and how we dreaded those glances.

273
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,660
He never asked for his name

274
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,500
to return to the convoy about to depart.

275
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:49,720
There was neither time nor desire
to consider moral or ethical issues.

276
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,220
Every man was controlled by one thought
only to keep himself alive for the

277
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:58,060
family, waiting for him at
home and to save his friends

278
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,780
with no hesitation. Therefore, he
would arrange for another prisoner,

279
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,380
another number to take his
place in the transport.

280
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,520
As I've already mentioned, the process of
selecting capital's was a negative one.

281
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,930
Only the most brutal of the
prisoners were chosen for this job.

282
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,360
So Kappos or prisoners,

283
00:21:26,361 --> 00:21:31,361
Jewish prisoners that got selected to
help run the prison camp and and Capco.

284
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,950
I tried to find the etymology of where
that came from and the best or the

285
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:43,400
closest or the thing that made the
most sense to me from what I read was,

286
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,660
was they had two words combined together,

287
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:51,830
comrade police than the in German.

288
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,590
Those got shortened to Cappo.

289
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,580
So some of these,

290
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,050
and you already heard one of those earlier
testimonies talking about the Jewish

291
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:08,051
police inside the prisons and how they
were just as bad as in many cases as the

292
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:13,950
Germans themselves
back to the book.

293
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,550
But apart from the selection of
capitals which was undertaken by the SS,

294
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:21,360
there was a sort of self selecting
process going on the whole time.

295
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:22,710
Among all the prisoners

296
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,890
on the average,

297
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,100
only those prisoners could keep alive
who after years of trekking from camp to

298
00:22:32,771 --> 00:22:36,940
camp had lost all scruples
in their fight for existence.

299
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,250
They were prepared to use every means,

300
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,310
honest and otherwise even brutal force
theft and betrayal of friends in order to

301
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,210
save themselves.

302
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:54,670
Will you have come back by the aid
of many lucky chances or miracles,

303
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:59,240
whatever one may choose to call them.
We know

304
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,760
the best of us did not return.

305
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,210
So there's a dynamic that you don't think
of immediately when you think of the

306
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:18,200
concentration camps. Number one,
you don't think about the Kappos,

307
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,080
the Jewish police that are
forced into this situation.

308
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:23,270
And then the other thing you
don't think about is this.

309
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,300
The fact that the people
that were going to survive,

310
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:30,980
we're basically,
I'm making it very broad say but,

311
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:35,030
but you know from what Viktor Frankl
Sane here it was the people that were

312
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:36,950
willing just to do anything to survive,

313
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,650
including betraying their friends
and he's saying straight up,

314
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,470
we know the best of us did not return.

315
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,140
And that is something that
you don't think about.

316
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,313
Okay.

317
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,530
Hey, we probably don't think about it
cause we don't want to think about it.

318
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,350
Because when you start thinking
about what would you do to survive,

319
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,580
what would you do to survive?
What would I do to survive?

320
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:10,310
And that's a question I don't think a
lot of people want to know the answer to

321
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,870
and it's very easy to go through life
and never have to answer that question.

322
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,200
Talking a little bit now

323
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:27,340
about what life was like in the camp,

324
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,700
back to the book somewhere it is said
that man cannot exist without sleep for

325
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:33,400
more than a stated number
of hours quite wrong.

326
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,260
I had been convinced that there were
certain things I just could not do.

327
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,270
I could not sleep without this or I
could not live without that or the other.

328
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,850
The first night in Auschwitz,

329
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,450
we slept in beds which were
constructed in tears on each tier,

330
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,040
measuring about six and
one half to eight feet,

331
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,820
slept nine men directly on the boards.

332
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,050
Two blankets would be
shared by each nine men.

333
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,580
We could of course lie only on our sides,
crowded in huddled against each other,

334
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,160
which had some advantages because of
the bitter cold though was forbidden to

335
00:25:14,161 --> 00:25:15,690
take shoes up to the Bronx.

336
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,430
Some people did use them
secretly as pillows in spite
of the fact that they were

337
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,620
caked with mud.
Otherwise,

338
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:27,300
one's head had to rest on the
crook of an almost dislocated arm

339
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,380
and yet sleep came and brought a Bolivian
and relief from the pain for a few

340
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,003
hours.

341
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,920
The thought of suicide was
entertained by nearly everyone,

342
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,960
if only for a brief time.

343
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,740
It was born of hopelessness
of the situation.

344
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,670
The constant danger of death
looming over us daily and hourly,

345
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,690
and the closeness of deaths
suffered by many of the others.

346
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,150
Okay.

347
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,730
From personal convictions,
which we mentioned later.

348
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,260
I made a firm promise on my first evening
in the camp that I would not run to

349
00:26:05,261 --> 00:26:06,094
the wire.

350
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,320
This was a phrase used in camp to describe
the most popular method of suicide,

351
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:15,220
touching the electrical electrically
charged barbed wire fence,

352
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:19,120
who's not entirely difficult
for me to make this decision.

353
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,420
There was little point
committing suicide since.

354
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,390
For the average inmate life expectation,

355
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:30,391
calculating objectively and counting
all likely chances was very poor.

356
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,930
He could not without any assurance,

357
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,140
he could not with any assurance expect
to be among the small percentage of men

358
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:38,940
who survived all the selections.

359
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:45,390
The prisoner of Auschwitz in the
first of shock did not fear death.

360
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,010
Even the gas chambers lost their horrors
for him after the first few days.

361
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,993
After all,

362
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,360
they spared him the act
of committing suicide

363
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,620
and Viktor Frankl was a psychiatrist
going into this situation.

364
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,690
So that's the,
that's the view.

365
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:15,930
That's the perspective that
he takes throughout this and

366
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:23,060
he's now been in for a couple days in
Auschwitz and another guy comes in to talk

367
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:31,080
to him who's another colleague of his,
and we're going back to the book.

368
00:27:31,081 --> 00:27:34,080
A colleague of mine who had arrived
in Auschwitz several weeks previously,

369
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,820
smuggled himself into our hut.

370
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,420
He wanted a calm and comfort
us and tell us a few things.

371
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,020
He becomes so thin that at first we did
not recognize him with a show of good

372
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:49,290
humor and a devil may care attitude.
He gave us a few hurry tips.

373
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,810
Don't be afraid.
Don't fear the selections.

374
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,970
Dr m the SS medical chief
has a soft spot for doctors,

375
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,870
but one thing I beg of you,

376
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:03,560
he continued shave daily
if at all possible.

377
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:06,290
Even if you have to use a
piece of glass to do it.

378
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,250
Even if you have to give your
last piece of bread for it,

379
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,120
you will look younger and the scraping
will make your cheeks look row Rudy,

380
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:17,480
or if you want to stay alive,

381
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,370
there's only one way look fit
for work if you even limp,

382
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:27,380
because let us say you have a small
blister on your heel and an ss man spots

383
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:32,330
this. He will wave you aside and the
next day you are sure to be gassed.

384
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,180
Now his mind and his thoughts,

385
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,390
he describes what he would
think about back to the book.

386
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,940
My mind still clung to
the image of my wife.

387
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,770
A thought crossed my mind. I didn't
even know if she were still alive.

388
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:07,390
I knew only one thing which
I have learned well by now,

389
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,280
love goes very far beyond the
physical person of the beloved.

390
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,690
Okay?

391
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,190
It finds its deepest meaning in his
spiritual being, in his inner self.

392
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,110
Whether or not he is actually present,

393
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,700
whether or not he is still alive at
all ceases somehow to be of importance.

394
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,750
I did not know whether my life wife was
alive and had no means of finding out

395
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,630
during all my prison life.
There was no outgoing or incoming mail,

396
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,890
but at that moment

397
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,390
it ceased to matter.
There was no need for me to know.

398
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,760
Nothing could touch the
strength of my love,

399
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,550
my thoughts and the image of my beloved.

400
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,570
Had I known then that my wife was dead.

401
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,830
I think that I still would have given
myself undisturbed by that knowledge to

402
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:04,831
the contemplation of her image and that
my mental conversation with her would

403
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,170
have been just as vivid
and just as satisfying.

404
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,693
Yeah,

405
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,610
sent me like a seal upon thy heart.

406
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,850
Love is as strong as death

407
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,300
and continuing on.

408
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:35,600
Doctor Frankel talks about
images from inside the camp.

409
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,610
Standing outside,

410
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:41,480
we saw sinister clouds glowing in the
west and the whole sky alive with clouds

411
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:45,410
of everchanging shapes and colors
from steel blue to blood red.

412
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,060
The desolate gray mud huts provided a
sharp contrast while the puddles on the

413
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:54,620
muddy ground reflected the glowing sky.

414
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,490
Then after a few minutes
of moving silence,

415
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:04,350
one prisoner said to another
how beautiful the world could be

416
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,020
and beyond looking for beauty around them,

417
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,990
they were able to find humor and I've,

418
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,900
I have people ask me about this from
time to time about humor in combat

419
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,090
situations and isn't it important and yes,

420
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:30,091
it absolutely is and you'd think in a
concentration camp even humor would go

421
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:35,750
away,
but not true.

422
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,110
Back to the book to discover that
there was any semblance of art in a

423
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:42,350
concentration camp must be
surprised enough for an outsider,

424
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,850
but he may be even more astonished to
hear that one could find a sense of humor,

425
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,560
could find a sense of humor there as well.
Of course,

426
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,240
only the faint trace of one and then
only for a few seconds or minutes.

427
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Humor was another of the souls of weapons
in the fight for self preservation.

428
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,880
It is well known that humor more than
anything else in the human makeup can't

429
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:12,881
afford an aloofness and an ability to
rise above any situation if only for a few

430
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,893
seconds.

431
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,770
The attempt to develop a sense of humor
and to see things in a humorous light is

432
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:24,700
some kind of trick I learned
while mastering the art of living.

433
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,040
Yet it is impossible to practice the art
of living even in a concentration camp.

434
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,450
Although suffering it is omnipresent.
To draw an analogy,

435
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,290
a man suffering is similar
to the behavior of gas.

436
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,400
If a certain quantity of gas is
pumped into an empty chamber,

437
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,440
it will fill the chamber completely an
evenly, no matter how big the chamber.

438
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:49,740
Okay.

439
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,880
Thus suffering completely fills
the human soul and conscious mind.

440
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:57,300
No matter whether the
suffering is great or little.

441
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,460
Therefore, the size of human
suffering is absolutely relative

442
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:12,910
and I think the point that I took away
from that was that chamber that can be

443
00:33:13,671 --> 00:33:16,880
filled up with suffering fill
it up with some humor as well.

444
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,730
Otherwise that that suffering will just
fill the whole chamber will fill your

445
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:27,460
whole brain
back to the book.

446
00:33:27,461 --> 00:33:29,650
We were grateful for
the smallest of mercies.

447
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,640
We were glad when there was time
to d Laos before going to bed.

448
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:39,580
Although in itself this was no pressure
pleasure as it meant standing naked in

449
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:42,670
an unheated hut where icicles
hung from the ceiling.

450
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,370
But we were thankful if there was no
air raid alarm during this operation and

451
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:51,080
the lights were not switched off.

452
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,270
Okay.

453
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,850
We cannot do the job properly.
We were kept awake half the night.

454
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:01,563
Okay.

455
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,260
So you're at a point in life where you're
grateful for being able to stand naked

456
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,870
and pick the lice off of your friends
before you go to bed so that the license

457
00:34:14,871 --> 00:34:17,310
will keep you awake at night
by chewing it, your body.

458
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,693
Okay.

459
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,840
And you know,
I talked about

460
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,500
how or he talks about how,
you know,

461
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:34,770
it was the person that was
going to survive, had to be
ruthless basically. Yeah.

462
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,100
And here he says,

463
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,850
but it's not for me to pass judgment on
those prisoners who put their own people

464
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:45,290
above everyone else who can throw a stone
at a man who favors his friends under

465
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:48,950
circumstances when sooner or later
it is a question of life or death.

466
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,280
No Man should judge unless he asks
himself in absolute honesty whether in a

467
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:58,280
similar situation he might
not have done the same.

468
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,013
Yeah,

469
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,343
and here he says,

470
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,730
I mentioned earlier how everything that
was not connected with the immediate

471
00:35:11,731 --> 00:35:16,731
task of keeping oneself and one
closest friends alives lost its value.

472
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,250
Okay.

473
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,950
Everything was sacrificed to this end.

474
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:22,640
Yeah.

475
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,640
A man's character became involved to
the point that he was caught in mental

476
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,060
turmoil,

477
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,050
which threatened all values he held
and threw them into doubt under the

478
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:38,100
influence of a world which no
longer recognize the of human life

479
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,090
and human dignity,

480
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,890
which had robbed the man of his will and
made him an object to be exterminated.

481
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,720
Having planned however,

482
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:50,100
to make full use of him first to the last
ounce of his physical resources under

483
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:54,730
this influence, the personal ego
finally suffered a loss of values.

484
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,760
Okay.

485
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,320
If the man in the concentration camp
did not struggle against this in a last

486
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,510
effort to save his self respect,

487
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:06,990
he lost the feeling of
being an individual,

488
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,550
of being with a mind,
with inner freedom

489
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,020
and personal value.

490
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,410
He thought of himself then as only
part of an enormous mass of people.

491
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,560
His existence descend it to
the level of animal life.

492
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:31,540
The men were herded sometimes
to one place then to another,

493
00:36:31,541 --> 00:36:35,800
sometimes driven together than apart like
a flock of sheep without a thought or

494
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:37,060
a will of their own.

495
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,130
A small but dangerous pack.
Watched them from all sides,

496
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,900
well versed in methods
of torture and sadism.

497
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,930
They drove the herd incessantly,
backwards and forwards with shouts,

498
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:56,931
kicks and blows and we the sheep thought
of two things only how to evade the bad

499
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:04,260
dogs and how to get a little food.

500
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,953
Yeah.

501
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,380
He's going to delve into this deeper,
this idea of this inner freedom.

502
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,653
Oh,

503
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,050
and how hard you had to fight to maintain
that and how easy it was just to roll

504
00:37:28,611 --> 00:37:31,490
in and become one of the pack,
one of the herd

505
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,043
back to the book.

506
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,580
It is very difficult for an outsider to
grasp how very little value was placed

507
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:42,990
on human life and camp.

508
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,830
The camp inmate was hardened to possibly
became more conscious of this complete

509
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:53,920
disregard of human existence.

510
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,030
When a convoy of sick men was arranged.
The May,

511
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:03,730
she hated bodies of the sick were thrown
on two wheeled carts which were drawn

512
00:38:03,731 --> 00:38:07,780
by prisoners for many miles, often
through snow storms to the next camp.

513
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,860
If one of the sick men had died before
the cart left, he was thrown on anyways.

514
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,080
The list had to be correct.
The list was the only thing that mattered.

515
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,303
Okay.

516
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:26,700
A man counted only because he had a prison
number one literally became a number

517
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,000
dead or alive.
That was unimportant.

518
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:35,140
The life of a number was
completely irrelevant.

519
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,300
What stood behind that number
and that life mattered even less.

520
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,750
Yeah.

521
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,730
The fate, the history,
the name of the man.

522
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,743
Yeah.

523
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,780
The camp inmate was frightened of making
decisions and if taking any sort of

524
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:04,220
initiative whatsoever.

525
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,080
This was the result of a strong feeling
that fate was one's master and that one

526
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:13,820
must not try to influence it in any way,

527
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:16,520
but instead let it take its own course.

528
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,253
In addition,

529
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,500
there was a great apathy which contributed
in no small part to the feelings of

530
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:29,350
the prisoner
at times,

531
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,100
lighting lightening
decisions had to be made,

532
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,830
decisions would spelled life or death.

533
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:40,870
The prisoner would have preferred
to let fate make the choice for him.

534
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,860
And so some of the examples that he brings
up in the book on that or they'd get

535
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:52,120
told we need people to go to
a different camp for rest.

536
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,720
Okay.

537
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:57,290
And they had no idea. Sometimes
it actually was some kind of rest.

538
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:01,070
Sometimes it was some kind
of actual medical facility.

539
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:04,880
Sometimes it was just you're going to
the gas chambers at another camp and they

540
00:40:04,881 --> 00:40:06,590
had no idea which one it was.

541
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,570
And so they got into this mode of
they were just going to externally,

542
00:40:11,571 --> 00:40:14,990
just whatever was going to happen there
was going to happen and they wouldn't,

543
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,220
they go beyond where they're trying to
in the beginning to like get me off that

544
00:40:19,221 --> 00:40:20,660
list or I want to be on that list.

545
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:24,730
And they realized that they just were
born messing with fate as they got into a

546
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:28,040
mode of I'm just going to let things
happen and whatever happens, happens.

547
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,303
Okay,

548
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:34,140
and they got this,
this feeling of apathy.

549
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:37,920
You can just imagine how that,

550
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,970
that having no control
externally of what's happening,

551
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,260
how that leads number one
leads to this apathy of just,

552
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:48,660
I don't care what happens,
but number two,

553
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:53,661
how that they can then sneak in and start
to get control of your inner thoughts

554
00:40:53,941 --> 00:40:56,580
and your inner feelings where you just
feel like you don't have control over

555
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:57,660
anything in life and that's it.

556
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,730
Okay.

557
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,460
That here he talks about apathy some more.

558
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,150
The prisoners apathy was also
the result of other factors.

559
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,960
Hunger and lack of sleep contributed
to it as they do in normal life also

560
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,630
and to the general irritability,

561
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,900
which was another characteristic
of the prisoners mental state.

562
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,800
The lack of sleep was partly
due to the pastoring of vermin,

563
00:41:21,801 --> 00:41:26,090
which infested the terribly overcrowded
hots because of the general lack of

564
00:41:26,091 --> 00:41:27,710
hygiene and sanitation.

565
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,620
The fact that we had neither nicotine nor
caffeine also contributed to the state

566
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,210
of apathy,
irritability.

567
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,700
Besides these physical causes,

568
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,020
there were mental ones in the
form of certain complexes.

569
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:47,070
The majority of prisoners suffered
from a kind of inferiority complex.

570
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,750
We all had once been or had
fancy ourselves to be somebody.

571
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,860
Now we were treated like
complete non entities.

572
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:04,150
The consciousness of one's inner
value is anchored in higher,

573
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:07,810
more spiritual things that
cannot be shaken by camp life.

574
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,070
But how many free men load
alone prisoners possess it

575
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,760
without consciously thinking about it,

576
00:42:15,761 --> 00:42:18,820
the average prisoner felt
himself utterly degraded.

577
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:25,830
This became obvious when one observed
the contrasts offered by the singular

578
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,870
sociological structure of the camp. The
more prominent prisoners, the Kappos,

579
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,793
the cooks,

580
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:36,780
the storekeepers and the camp policemen
did not as a rule feel degraded at all

581
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,270
like the majority of prisoners, but
on the contrary, he felt promoted.

582
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,910
Some even developed miniature
miniature delusions of grandeur.

583
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,240
Clearly we can all take a lesson out
of that one and that is, you know,

584
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:01,350
you get put into a promotion position
or you've got authority over people.

585
00:43:01,351 --> 00:43:05,040
Don't let that go to
your head. Yeah. It gets,

586
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:10,041
that's a natural thing where they did
this experiment test in the university,

587
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,710
whatever, and they're all just random
students. One played the prisoner,

588
00:43:13,711 --> 00:43:17,610
one group played the guards and
that happened. Yup. Like a act.

589
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,330
It's just an experiment.
It's not real life, you know?
And they still happen. Yeah.

590
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,530
And it happened in real life,
which I think is even more insane.

591
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,160
It's even more insane. Yeah. In a way.

592
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,610
But then again,

593
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,510
how can we sit here and judge when,

594
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,950
if you're in that situation and you need
to survive and you need to do the best

595
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,670
to get your, you to survive in your family
survive and you have an opportunity,

596
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,090
oh, are we going to say,
nope, nope. I'm going to,

597
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:53,130
instead of doing this where I maybe can
do something good in the long run, nope.

598
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,760
I'm not going to go across my values.
I'm going to die in three days.

599
00:43:56,761 --> 00:44:01,110
And that's it. Yeah. That's a hard
decision to make. Yeah. I mean,

600
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,100
it seems easy when you're sitting
in the comfort of your home. Like,

601
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:07,760
I wouldn't do that.
Or you can say,

602
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,190
and this is what I would have done or I
wouldn't have done. But yeah, you can.

603
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:15,990
You know, I, I, I talk to
people about, again, it's,

604
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,600
I'm not going to compare anything
to what we're talking about here,

605
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,240
but in the military for instance,

606
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,410
a lot of times I had to make decisions to,
to,

607
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,370
you know, I've got to do something
that maybe I didn't fully agree with,

608
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,210
but I knew in the long run it was going
to get me something that was going to be

609
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:36,210
beneficial to my team or
to my platoon or whatever.

610
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,200
So you make those little adjustments
and you got to suck it up and you do

611
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:43,140
something that you might not want to do,
but in the long run,

612
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,690
it's going to be beneficial. I mean, this,

613
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:50,610
I don't even know if this is
even a remotely close comparison,

614
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,170
but what I am saying is this, you
take a human being and you say, look,

615
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:59,820
you can either step up and act a different
way and be abusive to these people,

616
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:03,330
or you're going to be dead in three days.
That's it. Those are your choices. Yeah.

617
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,530
And it's not that hard to figure out
that a lot of people are going to step up

618
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:10,820
and say, cool, all abused those
people. Cause I need to live from the,

619
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:15,210
to live my choices. Either death.
Yeah. And by the way, maybe the,

620
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,650
maybe the best person in that group
is going to say, you know what?

621
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,760
I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna step
up and when I abused these people,

622
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,040
I'm going to do a little bit
less than someone else might.

623
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,610
And therefore I'm doing the
best I can. Yeah. I mean,

624
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:33,360
these are decisions how to even think
about these decisions. Yeah. Know Man.

625
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:36,790
And you have to think about it.

626
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,660
You have to understand that you have
to understand what human nature is.

627
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:41,940
That there is a survival point for humans.

628
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,810
You have an instinct instinct to survive
that very few people can overcome.

629
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,700
And I don't even, you know, again,

630
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:55,290
how do you judge whether it's right to
overcome it or not? When is it right?

631
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:58,800
I mean, obviously when is it right? We're
sitting here, it's easy to say, Hey,

632
00:45:58,801 --> 00:46:01,980
don't you know these guys? Why
would you kill yourself? Well,

633
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,220
if you don't do these things,
you're basically killing yourself.

634
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:09,570
If you don't step up, if you don't
say, okay, I'll work as a cappo.

635
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:14,460
If you don't do that, you're
killing yourself. Does that
make it okay man? Yeah,

636
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:15,000
it's brutal.

637
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,170
It's like you got to figure out whether
or not you're better off dead in the

638
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,680
evening in the grand scheme
of things like these,

639
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:25,500
these people that they're going to kind
of succumb to these positions or do all

640
00:46:25,501 --> 00:46:29,910
these low things to survive so
they can survive and you know,

641
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:31,260
live on and all this stuff.

642
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,670
So it's either that or am I
better off dead overall? You know,

643
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,530
like that's the decision you gotta
make Tang. Who knows what you think,

644
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,390
especially with all these
conditions. Yeah. You know
the opposite of that. It was,

645
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,200
it was a dick winters,
and was talking about how he,

646
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:48,780
and I don't know if I talked
about it on the podcast,

647
00:46:48,781 --> 00:46:51,450
but in the book conversations
with Dick Winters,

648
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,950
he t he goes through a big section where
he talks about some of the guys in his

649
00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:00,210
company and he called him the killers.
And he actually went on and said, hey,

650
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:00,451
you know,

651
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:03,660
I don't want to call them killers
because that's going to give the wrong

652
00:47:03,661 --> 00:47:08,190
impression. But these guys were my most
aggressive guys. They were my best guys.

653
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,240
And he's, and he said they
didn't make it past, you know,

654
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,660
he said most of them didn't make
it. I forget which, which battle.

655
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,590
But he said most of them didn't make it
past this certain time because they were

656
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:21,780
so aggressive.
They were such good guys.

657
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,220
They were so brave that
they didn't make it.

658
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,830
And this is sort of the opposite,
where you have

659
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,410
the people that are brave, I guess. No,

660
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:34,990
it's the same in that people that are
brave and gonna hold to their values,

661
00:47:34,991 --> 00:47:36,940
they're gonna die. Right. And,

662
00:47:36,941 --> 00:47:41,740
and if you think about somebody
that's cowardly in combat that says,

663
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,900
oh, you know what, you
know, Echo, you go first,

664
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:47,500
I'm going to sit over here behind this,
you know, uh, uh, covered position,

665
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,033
I'm going to live longer.

666
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,340
And it's a micro example of what
we're talking about here. Yeah.

667
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,800
In this, given the book and
what we're talking about,

668
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:04,300
his plate come off as borderline
insulting if not full fledged insulting.

669
00:48:04,301 --> 00:48:05,890
But you ever watched this show survivor?

670
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,350
I watched the first one when it was kind
of a thing and there was an interesting

671
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:16,340
psychology happening plus Rudy
Bosch was on it, you know, this, uh,

672
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,690
see what retired seal master chief,
you know,

673
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:22,600
everyone kind of knew in
the seal teams. Yeah. So,

674
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:26,830
and especially what you're going to say
is that the people that are not good

675
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,460
human beings are the ones that win.
Will they get far,

676
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,300
put it that way because they have this
weird mechanism at the end where the last,

677
00:48:34,301 --> 00:48:37,450
you know, few people who get voted
off, they become this sort of a jury.

678
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,290
So it's like if you went through
the whole game screwing people over,

679
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,990
the jury's going to get you
kind of thing. So it's uh, yeah.

680
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:47,440
And this is just how the show
just sorted itself out over time.

681
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,620
But the first ones didn't have any
jury. Right. I don't, I don't know.

682
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,230
I did in fact have been like,
I'm going to go ahead and say I,

683
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:58,470
I'm almost positive they didn't cause
Rudy had his hand on some log and they had

684
00:48:58,871 --> 00:49:03,640
to keep it there for like x and for a
long time. And one person, you know,

685
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,520
he actually thought of something else and
took his hand off and then he was out.

686
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:10,510
That was it. But yeah, there's
absolute comparison there.

687
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:13,600
There's an absolute comparison to,
you know,

688
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,890
if you're willing to be a snake,
you can,

689
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,300
you can, you can win the game. And I've
talked about that too, in promotion,

690
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,510
people getting promoted and if
you're willing to be a snake,

691
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,040
you can get promoted.

692
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:32,250
But the thing that I will say in a work
environment is that that snake might get

693
00:49:32,651 --> 00:49:35,170
one promotion,
they might get two promotions.

694
00:49:35,470 --> 00:49:36,790
They're not going to go the distance.

695
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:40,690
And if you hold the line
on doing what's correct,

696
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,900
then you might miss that first promotion.

697
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:45,520
You might even miss that second promotion,

698
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,160
but eventually if you're
on the right path,

699
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,980
you will get the recognition and
you will win in the long run.

700
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,890
You gotta be patient
though. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

701
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:58,660
obviously in your job it's not
life or death. You know, death is,

702
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:02,290
it's so close that you know, one slip
up, you're dead, you're dead. You know,

703
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,950
so that's, you know,
obviously the dynamics are
different in work in that way.

704
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,400
But otherwise, I think so. And survivor,

705
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,610
there's also that other thing that kind
of what they talk about where or what

706
00:50:12,611 --> 00:50:15,460
you were just talking about is if you,

707
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,770
it's kind of in a matter
of speaking plain,

708
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:21,460
it's safe where you're just hiding under
the wings and you might attach yourself

709
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:25,870
to someone or you'll avoid
any kind of, you know, uh,

710
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:30,470
risky per situation for sure.
In survivor,

711
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:32,510
you can make it far like
that as well. Yup. I mean,

712
00:50:32,511 --> 00:50:34,400
nowadays everyone knows
about those things. Like,

713
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,090
oh you backstabbed everyone or you just
hid behind this guy cause he's strong.

714
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:39,140
But at the same time,

715
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,890
just so they call you how you were
saying if you're brave or you're going to

716
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:44,000
stick to your morals and
be honest with everyone,

717
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,040
like you'll get voted off real quick.
Even if you're really good at it.

718
00:50:47,090 --> 00:50:48,900
You know the challenges are
something I'm going to go,

719
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:50,980
we don't even like really
good leaders get voted.

720
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,600
Like if someone just says a dynamic
leader, they get voted off. Exactly right.

721
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,600
Too much of a threat. Too much of
a threat to every second counts.

722
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,420
And actually what you're talking
about going through seal training,

723
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:02,060
I would hear it and it was,
I didn't hear it when I went through,

724
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:05,210
but I heard it later.
This idea of the gray man.

725
00:51:05,211 --> 00:51:07,850
And I think we might have
actually answered a question
on the podcast about that

726
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,550
was going through training
and just being a gray man,

727
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:14,750
meaning just don't stand out
and you'll be good to go.

728
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:19,810
And that's, that's a, that's
a, that's a strategy, Ryan,

729
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,990
the seal teams is that it's the
strategy going through buds. Oh,

730
00:51:22,991 --> 00:51:24,170
it through seal training,

731
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:27,290
the initial she'll training course because
the minute you stand out and people

732
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:29,840
start knowing who you are and now you've
got an instructor's looking at you and

733
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:31,790
the more they watch you,
the more they can see.

734
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,450
Maybe you're making some mistakes or
maybe you're not doing everything right or

735
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:38,510
maybe you're not. And so it's better
just to be that guy in the middle.

736
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,500
I was the guy in the middle,
not because I wanted to meet,

737
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,920
but because I was not the fastest runner.
I wasn't the best swimmer.

738
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:48,230
What you don't want to be as
the guy on the tail end. Right.

739
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,100
And it's weird because I put so many guys,
not through the basic seal training,

740
00:51:52,101 --> 00:51:55,400
but through the advanced seal
training and the guys that I remember,

741
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:56,870
there's two types of guys that I remember,

742
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,970
the guys that were awesome and
the guys that were horrible,

743
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,630
and the guys in the middle, all the gray
guys, I know him when I see him. Right.

744
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,870
But a lot of times I don't,
100% I might not know their name.

745
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,850
Whereas some of the pipe hitters,

746
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:11,300
the young pipette or some e five pipe
pinner that was just getting after it.

747
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:13,880
I'd always remember those guys names cause
they would take control of everything

748
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,460
and they'd stand out.
And then the other guys,

749
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:17,660
you remember the guys that
are totally jacked up.

750
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,360
So that idea of being a gray man,

751
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,260
it seems like a good policy to have
in the concentration camp. Look,

752
00:52:24,261 --> 00:52:27,010
I just don't want to stand out. I don't
want to have a limp. I don't want to,

753
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:30,620
you know, come across as I just want
to fit in. And then the gray man,

754
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,770
unless you're going to go the
distance, right. Which is, and,

755
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:39,530
and that's a horrible way of saying
I'm going to stand out by saying, Hey,

756
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:42,350
I can whip these prisoners into shape.
Right.

757
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,910
That's going and raising your hand
and saying, I'll be a cappo. I,

758
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:46,820
I'm going to step up.

759
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,690
And what you're risking there is we
don't know where this war is going to end

760
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:54,380
and where are you going to be at
the end of this thing. And you know,

761
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:55,580
I read some stories about that.

762
00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:00,640
The war did ENT and they did liberate
these camps and it didn't work out good

763
00:53:00,801 --> 00:53:05,120
for the Kappos.
So there's,

764
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,820
there's the same thing.
You might've been done all right,

765
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:10,070
getting your promotion
the first couple times,

766
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:14,930
but eventually it comes
around exactly right. Yeah.

767
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,350
You know,

768
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,480
Harley Flanagan was talking about Karma
and I don't know how much reality there

769
00:53:19,481 --> 00:53:20,450
is that,
but there's,

770
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:25,451
there's the reality of you reap
what you sow and if you people,

771
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:29,070
if you,
if you take advantage of your position,

772
00:53:29,071 --> 00:53:31,380
if you maneuver and screw people
over to get ahead of them,

773
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,820
they'll remember that. They'll remember
that. Yeah. And that makes sense. I mean,

774
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,850
Carmel [inaudible] it's
never worth it by the way.

775
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,190
It's never worth it.
I mean,

776
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:45,600
could you possibly come up with
some scenario where, where,

777
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:46,260
you know,

778
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,530
I did this to get a promotion so that I
could take care of you and everyone else.

779
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,930
You could come up with a sense,
but it's very, very rare and,

780
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,550
and my gut feeling was always like,
it's not worth it.

781
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:01,890
It's not worth it to do those little
maneuvers in and to try and better your

782
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:06,840
position on other people's backs.
We're screwing someone over in,

783
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:08,130
cause you've got to live with that too.
I mean,

784
00:54:08,131 --> 00:54:10,080
unless you're like a sociopath
or something like that,

785
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,520
you have to live with that and men. Yeah,

786
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:17,760
and even at the time it seems like, oh,
I could live with that because oh look,

787
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:19,020
you know what?
You're actually,

788
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:22,050
you're actually taking the higher
road than me because you're saying you

789
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:25,200
personally have to live with it. And
that's definitely, I'm saying beyond that,

790
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:26,820
even if you're a person
that can live with it,

791
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,130
you're still gonna pay in the long run.

792
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:30,960
Even if he didn't look yourself in
the mirror and be like, I don't care,

793
00:54:30,961 --> 00:54:35,160
I got promoted. That's good. That's okay.
So you can live with that. That's cool.

794
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:35,760
But guess what?

795
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,850
There's something else you're going to
that's going to come back around and that

796
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:43,200
is one of those other people that you
stepped on their back is going to invent

797
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:45,390
something new at work and he's
going to take over the division.

798
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:49,460
Then you're going to pay not to mention
the 10 people who watched it happen and

799
00:54:49,461 --> 00:54:52,530
you know, yeah, you're just
making enemies, enemies.

800
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,970
And that's really what
Karma as far as I mean,

801
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:59,580
Karma could be this mystical thing that
personally watches you and has this

802
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:04,290
judgment system must be real. Just real
life. Just like if I walk up to, you know,

803
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,450
even mean you're even,
we don't know each other.

804
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,260
I don't have any bad or good feelings
towards you and I come and I slap you.

805
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:15,720
I created a deficit. Now, now
your intention, big deficit.

806
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:20,770
So your intention, whether you
do it or not, you're what you,

807
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:24,030
you're compelled to slap me
back if not more, usually more.

808
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,990
So that's kind of really what it is.
I mean, really in a small, teeny,

809
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:31,930
tiny nutshell. Yeah. I go out
and start acting mad to everyone.

810
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,230
They're not going to be
like, oh, I love you. I mean,

811
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,960
they might because they might
be intellectual or you know,

812
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:39,510
they might be able to think about it,
but they're natural.

813
00:55:39,511 --> 00:55:44,040
Compulsion will be to be mad at
you back. And, and this, you know,

814
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,880
the podcast, human nature,
talking about human nature.

815
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:52,380
And I always say that war reveals human
nature more clearly than anything else

816
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:56,610
because it's so much pressure on the
people. Obviously a concentration camp,

817
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,720
it's revealing human nature and that's
exactly what we're talking about.

818
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:05,870
And it reveals itself in crystal clarity
on a massive scale in terms of being

819
00:56:07,381 --> 00:56:12,030
able to see it in a concentration camp
and you see it reveal itself on a TV show

820
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,470
called survivor and you see that reveal
itself in, in the work environment.

821
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:19,200
And what I'm saying is from all that,

822
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:23,860
what you want to do is you want to make
sure that when you get into a position

823
00:56:23,861 --> 00:56:24,610
of authority,

824
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:28,930
you don't abuse it. That's what I'm
saying. Yeah. You don't want to abuse it.

825
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:32,410
You want to treat people
with respect no matter what.

826
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,420
And you don't want to step on people's
backs to get ahead because ultimately

827
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,230
it's not going to pay off.
It really isn't. Yeah.

828
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,430
You're only going to full
like that leader that you see,

829
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,750
that you fooled into thinking
that you are a great guy.

830
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,670
It's only gonna last for so long. Yeah.
And eventually you're gonna get found out.

831
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:56,740
Okay.

832
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,100
Now. All right, let's get, let's
get back into the book here.

833
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:06,150
The experiences of camp life show that
man does have a choice of action and this

834
00:57:07,451 --> 00:57:10,000
is, we've talked about the capitalists
and he's gonna talk about some of the more

835
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:14,920
heroic people and in some of those
actions very briefly, and he says,

836
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:17,320
because it's the reason there was very
briefly because there wasn't a lot of

837
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:18,460
them.
Yeah.

838
00:57:20,050 --> 00:57:23,560
The experiences of camp life show
that man does have a choice of action.

839
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,000
There were enough examples,

840
00:57:25,001 --> 00:57:29,980
often of a heroic nature which
proved that apathy could be overcome.

841
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,320
Irritability,
irritability,

842
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:37,350
suppressed man can preserve a
vestige of spiritual freedom,

843
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,520
of independence of mind.

844
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:45,820
Even in such terrible conditions
of psychic and physical stress.

845
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:52,620
We who lived in concentration camps
can remember the men who walked through

846
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:53,764
huts,

847
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:58,090
comforting others giving away
their last piece of bread.

848
00:57:59,050 --> 00:57:59,670
Okay.

849
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,800
They may have been few in number,

850
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:06,960
but they offer sufficient proof that
everything can be taken from a man.

851
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,010
But one thing,

852
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:14,540
the last of the human freedoms to choose
one's attitude in any given set of

853
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:21,930
circumstances to choose one's own way,
eh,

854
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:26,970
and there it is. I mean
that is it. That is it.

855
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:29,280
This idea,
and you know,

856
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,360
Captain Plumb talked about it as well
and captain plumb had a quote from

857
00:58:33,361 --> 00:58:38,361
Stockdale and we got to explore this and
I've got a bunch of Stockdale books and

858
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:41,130
are we will get to some Stockdale books.

859
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:46,850
Who is the senior guy in the Hanoi Hilton
and he's a fighter pilot philosopher

860
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,280
guy.
Brilliant guy to hero.

861
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:55,340
One of them was awarded the Medal
of honor and one of the things that,

862
00:58:55,441 --> 00:59:00,000
that that captain plumb was talking to
us about is his captain plumb said that

863
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:03,000
they got word from Stockdale
and I'm going to misquote it,

864
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,230
but I'm going to do my best.

865
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:08,760
It was just because we're in a prison
camp doesn't mean we have to be on

866
00:59:08,761 --> 00:59:12,750
defense. We're going to be
on offense in a prison camp.

867
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:18,540
That's just a completely different
attitude. It's choosing the attitude.

868
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:23,000
We're not going to sit here and
be abused and and be put down.

869
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:27,120
We're going to step up. We're going
to, we're going to go on offense and,

870
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,900
and they did. They did hunger
strikes, they passed word around.

871
00:59:29,901 --> 00:59:32,810
They wouldn't stand up when people
enter their, they did these things,

872
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,350
they went on offense and that's
what he's talking about right here.

873
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:41,351
This last human freedom to choose
one's attitude in any given set of

874
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:46,940
circumstances,
we always have that choice.

875
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,630
No matter what the circumstances are that
surround you always have that choice.

876
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:51,643
Hmm.

877
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:59,820
Back to the book and there will
always choices to make. Every day,

878
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:03,030
every hour offered the
opportunity to make a decision,

879
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:08,270
a decision which determined whether
you would or would not submit to those

880
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:12,300
powers which threatened to
rob you of your very self,

881
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:13,770
your inner freedom,

882
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:20,760
which determined whether or not you would
become the play thing of circumstance.

883
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:26,390
Renouncing freedom and dignity to become
molded into the form of the typical

884
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:27,803
inmate.

885
01:00:32,110 --> 01:00:32,943
Okay.

886
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,210
Again, there it is. You,

887
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,260
you're in a concentration camp,
doomed,

888
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,090
doomed,
and yet you can hang on to that last,

889
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,360
that last bastion of freedom in your soul.

890
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,230
I'm not let them win and
not let them own that.

891
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,410
Back to the book scene.
From this point of view,

892
01:00:59,411 --> 01:01:03,610
the mental reactions of the inmates have
a concentration camp must seem more to

893
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:07,930
us than the mere expression of certain
physical and sociological conditions.

894
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,500
Even though conditions
such as lack of sleep,

895
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:16,600
insufficient food and various mental
stresses may suggest that the inmates were

896
01:01:16,601 --> 01:01:20,380
bound to react in certain ways.
In the final analysis,

897
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:25,650
it becomes clear that the sort of person
the prisoner became was the result of

898
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:32,020
inner decision and not the
result of camp influences alone.

899
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:37,630
Think about that.

900
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:45,070
The sort of person the prisoner became
was the result of an inner decision and

901
01:01:46,231 --> 01:01:47,820
not the result of the circumstances here,

902
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:50,650
and that doesn't matter what
kind of person you become. Hmm.

903
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,880
What matters is the
decisions that you make

904
01:01:58,530 --> 01:01:59,363
unbelievable

905
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:04,660
back to the book fundamentally.
Therefore,

906
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,720
any man can even under such circumstances
decide what shall become of him

907
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:14,800
mentally and spiritually. Okay.
Physically you can have that one.

908
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:18,640
Can't control that. All the Delta all
the time, but mentally and spiritually,

909
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:20,880
I get to decide what I'm going to be.

910
01:02:21,350 --> 01:02:22,183
Hmm.

911
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:30,990
He may retain his human dignity
even in a concentration camp.

912
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:37,540
Dusty Yefsky said once,
there is only one thing that I dread

913
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,940
not to be worthy of my sufferings.

914
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,650
Okay.

915
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:47,850
These words frequently came to my mind
after I became acquainted with those

916
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:50,670
murders, who, whose behavior and camp,

917
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,880
who's suffering and death bore witness
to the fact that the last inner freedom

918
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:58,980
cannot be lost.

919
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:06,000
It can be said that they were
worthy of their sufferings.

920
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:07,140
Yeah.

921
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:12,140
The way they board their suffering
was a genuine inner achievement.

922
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,090
Yeah.

923
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:18,860
It is this spiritual freedom
which cannot be taken away,

924
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:23,000
that makes life meaningful and purposeful.

925
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:32,860
The way in which a man accepts his
fate and all the suffering it entails,

926
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:37,670
the way in which he takes up his
cross gives him ample opportunity,

927
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:42,820
even under the most difficult
circumstances to add a
deeper meaning to his life.

928
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,890
It may remain brave,
dignified,

929
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,240
and unselfish, or in a bitter
fight for self preservation.

930
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:56,960
He may forget is human dignity
and become no more than an animal.

931
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,760
Okay?

932
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,740
Here lies the chance for a man
either to make use of or to forgo the

933
01:04:03,741 --> 01:04:08,741
opportunities of attaining the moral
values that a difficult situation may

934
01:04:08,991 --> 01:04:09,860
afford him.

935
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:17,280
And this decides whether he is
worthy of his sufferings or not.

936
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,320
So think about that.

937
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:24,470
When you get faced with
this ultimate challenge,

938
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,040
brutal challenge,
when life is just about to crush you,

939
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:35,580
that's when you have the biggest
opportunity to prove who you are.

940
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,483
Yeah.

941
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:38,950
You know,
speaking of,

942
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:45,480
of of unworthy topics,
but this is something I,

943
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:48,320
when I was, when I first got to see
what I, when I was at seal team won,

944
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:53,440
I ran a communications class
and when I ran the class we,

945
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:57,310
I was like super hard.
And I know it comes as a big shocker,

946
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,840
but we would great test, test, test on
all these different subjects. You know,

947
01:05:01,841 --> 01:05:05,470
what radio, what frequency, your
bandwidth, what do you know?

948
01:05:05,471 --> 01:05:10,420
All these different subjects.
And I would say the guys, Hey,

949
01:05:10,421 --> 01:05:11,770
you know,
tomorrow we've got another test,

950
01:05:11,771 --> 01:05:14,200
another opportunity for
you to prove yourself.

951
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:18,620
And that's the way I looked at.
They didn't always look at it same way,

952
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,400
but that's exactly exactly
what he's saying here.

953
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:25,030
When you have these brutal
circumstances that you face,

954
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:31,030
that's your opportunity. And if you
think about all heroic tales, right?

955
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,020
There's no heroic tales where the
hero doesn't face any challenges.

956
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:37,600
And as a matter of fact,
the worst challenges he faces,

957
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:41,110
the more of a hero he becomes.
Yeah. If he rises to the occasion,

958
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,640
if he doesn't rise the gays, and guess
what? We don't hear about them. Right.

959
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:44,890
Not a hero,
not a hero.

960
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:47,530
Okay.

961
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:48,670
Yeah.
In fact,

962
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,800
let's say you're considered a hero and
then this big chance to prove yourself

963
01:05:56,741 --> 01:05:59,620
comes about and you fail
or you don't step up,

964
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,960
you're kind of like this
big failure in a way,

965
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:06,610
even though you've been a hero of the
whole time. Yeah. I would say that's true.

966
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:12,280
Although if you do something heroic
enough, people are like good with it.

967
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:13,150
Right.

968
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,510
I think if they're significant enough
to say so it's kind of the same thing.

969
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,500
Yeah. I mean, the bottom line
is you face these challenges,

970
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:25,600
you get challenged to, to have
this attitude of, you know,

971
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:30,430
basically good opportunity, opportunity
to solve the problems. Right? Oh,

972
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:35,170
big challenge. Cool opportunity. Good.
Yeah. It's like those guys who, you know,

973
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:36,160
they start a business,

974
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:40,690
the businesses like grows and then it
just massively fails because of some

975
01:06:40,691 --> 01:06:44,440
mistake or I dunno, something and some
or the kind of out in or whatever,

976
01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:45,620
and then they,
oh,

977
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:48,570
they reach rock bottom and they build
themselves back up and then, you know,

978
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,660
it's this massive success. That's
an impressive story. Yeah. You know,

979
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:57,040
that's much better than, hey, I
went to this school, I graduated,

980
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:01,000
I worked this job, I made a bunch
of money. Everyone goes, oh, cool.

981
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:05,500
Right, cool. Yeah, yeah. They
want to hear the struggle.

982
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:07,630
They want to see that you are challenged.
Yep.

983
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,610
Back to the book,
everywhere man is confronted with fate,

984
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,650
with the chance of achieving, of achieving
something through his own suffering.

985
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:22,200
God, think about that. The, the,

986
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:28,850
the suffering that you're going through
is an a chance to achieve something

987
01:07:29,221 --> 01:07:31,950
through your suffering.
That's an incredible thought.

988
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:36,690
That's an incredible thought.
Now,

989
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:41,750
this next part is something that I get
asked about on a fairly regular basis.

990
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:45,510
Back to the book.
Take the fate of the sick,

991
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:49,830
especially those who are incurable.

992
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:55,050
I once read a letter written by young
invalid in which he told a friend that he

993
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:57,060
had just found out he
would not live for long,

994
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,640
that even an operation
would be of no help.

995
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:04,980
He wrote further that he remembered
a film he had seen in which a man was

996
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:09,300
portrayed who waited for death and
end courageous and dignified way.

997
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:13,210
The boy had a thought.
It agree,

998
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:16,520
the boy had fought it
a great to meet deaf.

999
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:21,521
So well now he wrote fate was
offering him a similar chance.

1000
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,640
Okay.

1001
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,140
Yeah. I mean there's,
there's, you know, diseases,

1002
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,430
terminal diseases and that's it.
And then what do you do?

1003
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:43,630
Well, I think you have to choose
the best possible attitude you can.

1004
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,980
And again, I've never been
in that situation obviously,

1005
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:50,063
but

1006
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:56,290
that statement seems to be the
best possible attitude to take.

1007
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:04,190
Again, that's, that's when we see
people doing something heroic.

1008
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,670
That's what we see. And you
know, it's funny, some of those,

1009
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:11,000
when we were doing a lot of the
native Americans on the podcast,

1010
01:09:11,001 --> 01:09:15,410
they all had that attitude. When you
go to face death, hold your head high,

1011
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:19,970
be afraid of it.
And that's really,

1012
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:24,020
like you said, an easier sitting here in
the, you know, in the recording studio.

1013
01:09:24,021 --> 01:09:26,390
He of course,
easy for me to sit here and say that.

1014
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,543
Yeah.

1015
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,530
But that's a hard one. And you know, um,

1016
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:37,520
the other day all the Joe Rogan
podcast Everlast was on there.

1017
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:42,480
Yeah. And Joe Rogan, he, you know,

1018
01:09:42,510 --> 01:09:45,540
Everlast who's saying, hey, you know,
I'm not in good shape right now.

1019
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:47,400
I wish I could better shape,
but I have, you know, back,

1020
01:09:47,401 --> 01:09:50,670
I think he's got a back injury and he's
got this and he's got a daughter that's

1021
01:09:50,671 --> 01:09:52,110
got some kind of illness,

1022
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:57,890
bad illness and Joe put on the good
video that you made and you know,

1023
01:09:58,441 --> 01:10:01,950
Everlast when he got done Everlast
was like, hey, that's cool,

1024
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:05,000
that's inspirational. But how does that
help me with my sick daughter? Yeah.

1025
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:09,420
What's good about that? You know, and I
wished I could have jumped through and,

1026
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,780
and talk to him because this much,

1027
01:10:12,781 --> 01:10:16,320
I will say when you got a
bad situation like that,

1028
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:20,850
I'm telling you right now, it
could be worse. Absolutely.

1029
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:21,780
100%.

1030
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,950
And the fact that he's talking about his
daughter and how she's sick and how he

1031
01:10:25,951 --> 01:10:28,380
has to spend so much time with
her to take care of her. Well,

1032
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,640
well that's what I'm saying.

1033
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:33,810
Be Thankful that you're in a position in
life where you can spend time with her.

1034
01:10:33,811 --> 01:10:37,610
Be Thankful that she's in a condition
where she can spend time with you. Yeah.

1035
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:42,330
And you know, there's, she's
still here. If nothing else,

1036
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:47,040
that's good, if nothing else. And so
what are you gonna do? I mean your, your,

1037
01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:51,720
your other option is to say, my daughter
is sick. This is horrible. I got cursed.

1038
01:10:51,721 --> 01:10:55,470
It's, it's not fair. And
what does that do for you?

1039
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:58,780
Where does that get you? It doesn't
get you anywhere. It matter of fact,

1040
01:10:58,781 --> 01:10:59,790
that takes you backwards.

1041
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:05,100
So you really truly do have to
look at these horrible situations.

1042
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,930
I remember I got a call
back from, from, uh,

1043
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:13,860
overseas that a guy was a seal,

1044
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,070
was really badly wounded.
And,

1045
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:22,310
and a couple of my friends were kind of
distraught and I talked to one of the

1046
01:11:23,491 --> 01:11:28,370
guys overseas and I, you know, and,

1047
01:11:28,371 --> 01:11:32,490
and your man, I had at this point,
you know, lost mark, lost Mikey.

1048
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,740
I don't think Ryan had died yet,

1049
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:39,100
but like I was familiar with guys dying.
Yeah.

1050
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:44,610
And I talked to one of the guys that was
overseas and they said, hey, you know,

1051
01:11:44,611 --> 01:11:48,300
this guy, he's really, really messed
up. And I'm like, is he going to live?

1052
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,700
And they're like, yeah, he's stable. And
I go, then don't worry about a thing.

1053
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,490
Be Happy he's alive.

1054
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,970
And it doesn't matter if he's missing
a leg or two legs or whatever,

1055
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:05,550
he's going to be coming home and
he's going to carry on with his life.

1056
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:08,400
And it's going to be hard
and it's going to be hell,

1057
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,850
and it's going to be a
challenge. But guess what? He's
going to be here, you know?

1058
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,570
And that, you know, again, it's
like, man, what's the alternative?

1059
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:22,650
The alternative is he's
dead. The alternative is we
never talked to them again.

1060
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:27,710
That's the alternative versus
he's going to come back.

1061
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,030
Right. And this guy,
the guy that got wonder,

1062
01:12:30,031 --> 01:12:31,470
he wasn't like a great friend of mine,

1063
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:35,220
but I knew I was talking to people that
were very close to them. And so, you know,

1064
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:39,810
I had to make sure I wasn't coming across
like, hey, it's no big deal. I, you know,

1065
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,600
look, he's going to be fine. No,
it wasn't like that. But look,

1066
01:12:42,601 --> 01:12:44,400
look what the alternative is.
You know,

1067
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:49,430
let's be thankful that he's alive and
he's going to come home and you know he's

1068
01:12:50,221 --> 01:12:53,700
going to carry on with his life. And
that's what, that's what's important.

1069
01:12:53,701 --> 01:12:57,870
So it's really when you do look at these
situations, when things are going bad,

1070
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:01,260
and then you say, okay, well what
good can come of that? And then the,

1071
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:04,410
the one step further is then what
happens when someone does die?

1072
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:09,270
Then what good comes of that?
And my thought is always the same thing.

1073
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:12,510
I'm thankful that I got
to know that person.

1074
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:16,860
I'm thankful that I got to
understand their personality.

1075
01:13:16,861 --> 01:13:21,810
I'm thankful that I got to spend a day
with them laughing and having that memory.

1076
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:23,460
That's what's good.

1077
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:27,180
What's good is I got to experience them
in my life and they got to experience

1078
01:13:27,181 --> 01:13:32,100
other people's in their lives. And that's
what's good about it. But just to say,

1079
01:13:32,190 --> 01:13:35,550
hey, you know, my friend,

1080
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,830
my family member is dead.

1081
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:42,390
This is horrible and I can't
escape from this wrong attitude.

1082
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,760
And of course you're going
to go through that. It's the,

1083
01:13:44,761 --> 01:13:47,160
there's the whatever those
things are that you go through.

1084
01:13:47,161 --> 01:13:52,161
It's shock and then denial and
then anger and then acceptance and,

1085
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,280
and all that. That's, I get it.
And it's not going to be easy,

1086
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:01,550
but I'll tell you what will make it easier
is to look at the situation and say,

1087
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:05,130
what here is good. You know, and you,

1088
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:09,630
one of the worst things is parents
will that have young children that are

1089
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:11,860
terminally ill.
It's awful.

1090
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,000
It's awful.

1091
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:18,490
And the best you can think of is a
hold them while you can. Yeah. Right.

1092
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:22,450
And and get what you can and grow
the memories that you can right now.

1093
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:27,130
Because just to focus on the fact that
life isn't fair isn't going to help you.

1094
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:31,750
And guess what, you're right.
Life isn't fair. Life isn't fair.

1095
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,830
It's, it's, it's a random, horrible thing.

1096
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,750
And if you want to focus on the
randomness and the horribleness of it,

1097
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:42,670
that's where you're going to end up.

1098
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,930
But if you can focus on the good
that comes out of those situations,

1099
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:51,340
try to you, and again, I haven't been
through that, I haven't been through that.

1100
01:14:51,341 --> 01:14:55,390
Thank God, not that level for
sure. But the best I can do,

1101
01:14:55,391 --> 01:14:57,670
the best I can assess is say,
man,

1102
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:01,950
at least try and look at what positive
is coming out of this and, and,

1103
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:06,550
and focus on that instead of
focusing on what is negative chew.

1104
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,110
It's going back to what Frankl said.

1105
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,750
You choose what your attitude
is going to be. Yeah.

1106
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:14,920
Don't become a victim of the
randomness. Yeah. And that's,

1107
01:15:14,921 --> 01:15:18,040
so that goes on like all levels.

1108
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:22,000
You know how even if like something
isn't horrible, it's just kind of junk,

1109
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:26,440
you know, all the way down to just
something that's, that's pretty horrible.

1110
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:30,640
There's still a lot of good
going on in the situation.

1111
01:15:30,641 --> 01:15:35,170
But in just like are you saying like
your attitude or another way to put it is

1112
01:15:35,171 --> 01:15:38,350
what you're looking for to,
to internalize. You know,

1113
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:41,890
a lot of times and it's natural and I've
been there where it's like everything

1114
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:43,570
just seems bad.
Even the smell,

1115
01:15:43,571 --> 01:15:47,080
like if something real bad happens that
you think is real bad and then the same

1116
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:50,830
day or the next day or whatever,
something small bad happens,

1117
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,810
it'll just add big time to the badness.

1118
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:55,300
Like nothing's going
right kind of attitude.

1119
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:57,250
Meanwhile all the good things
are going on all around you,

1120
01:15:57,251 --> 01:15:59,650
but you're not looking for that.
All of those things. Yeah. So,

1121
01:15:59,651 --> 01:16:01,710
and a lot of times we
like real bad situation,

1122
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,670
especially especially with
kids cause that's like the,

1123
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:07,030
the most weak you can ever
feel really when like your kid,

1124
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:08,170
like when my daughter had,

1125
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,840
she had a big staff infection Murcia
in her lymph node. So her neck was be,

1126
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:13,750
she's in the hospital for
a week and we're there.

1127
01:16:15,370 --> 01:16:18,370
That's like the most weekend
that that you'll feel in.

1128
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,960
Of course there's way
worse situations than the,

1129
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:23,770
you know then that that's nothing
compared to situations. I know that.

1130
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:29,280
But there are good things that a are
still going on in your situation,

1131
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:34,300
your life, that's a B, there's good
situations that can come of it.

1132
01:16:34,780 --> 01:16:38,320
And a lot of them, a lot of them is
just our strength related. You know,

1133
01:16:38,321 --> 01:16:41,890
like if you let something beat you
down and you don't get the stray,

1134
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:44,770
like that's a loss,
you'll lose. Like you'll

1135
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:51,040
call it some kind of conditioning from it
in a way. In a matter of speaking. Yes.

1136
01:16:51,041 --> 01:16:54,280
So like if you have a quote
unquote good attitude,

1137
01:16:55,150 --> 01:16:59,830
when you emerge from the situation, you
will have strength. Now, if you don't,

1138
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:04,090
you won't. You'll have weakness, you'll
be gun shy. Everything happens bad.

1139
01:17:04,091 --> 01:17:07,810
My life sucks. And you know, you'll
continue down kind of that road.

1140
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:10,160
So the good part,
like if you said like

1141
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,660
are you said, if you keep that good
attitude and when you make it out,

1142
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:18,740
you will have this among the other
good things that can come from it.

1143
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:22,550
You will have the strength and
you're, you're right. And I mean,

1144
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:27,050
just look at captain plumb and look at
colonel reader ado for those guys to go

1145
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:30,560
through what they went through and,
and maintain a positive attitude.

1146
01:17:30,561 --> 01:17:33,150
And then they come out and you talking to
those guys and it's like, yeah, I don't,

1147
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:37,370
you can't think of more positive
people in the world, you know? I mean,

1148
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:38,271
not in the whole world,

1149
01:17:38,271 --> 01:17:42,560
but they're just have so much positivity
because they've been through something

1150
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,440
and they had to maintain that attitude.
So you're right, when they come out,

1151
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:47,180
it's like,
how are you going to make?

1152
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:51,380
And I think that's what happens a lot
of times with guys that have been to war

1153
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:55,980
is they come back and they're like happy
to see the sunrise. I know I am right.

1154
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:57,320
I'm happy to see the sunrise.

1155
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:01,160
I'm happier than a lot of people to see
the sunrise. I appreciate that thing.

1156
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,700
And I think when people go through some
kind of devastating disease in their

1157
01:18:04,701 --> 01:18:07,940
family or themselves, same
thing. Once they get through it,

1158
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,240
they at least come out the other
side and they can appreciate it.

1159
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,690
And yet if they let it beat him
down, it's going to, it's going to,

1160
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,910
everything is going to look down.
If you're looking down,

1161
01:18:16,911 --> 01:18:19,660
you're going to look down. If you're
looking up, you're going to look up. Yeah,

1162
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,680
that's gotta be a, it's hard. I
mean, it's so hard for people.

1163
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:29,060
It's so hard. Yeah. And again, I'm over
here talking, you know? Yeah, for sure.

1164
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:31,010
Both of us are, you know,
when I was on Joe Rogan,

1165
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:34,070
we started off talking
about Chris Cornell.

1166
01:18:34,071 --> 01:18:37,430
It just killed himself and we kind of
cursory kind of talked about depression

1167
01:18:37,431 --> 01:18:39,920
and neither Waldo. I mean, I
definitely am not claiming,

1168
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:44,750
claiming to be any kind of expert at
all about it. And I even said on there,

1169
01:18:44,751 --> 01:18:46,070
I was like, look, I've
never felt this way.

1170
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:49,010
And I had a couple people hit me up on
social media, like, you know, you should,

1171
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,670
you should read this or you should
do this or, and, and you know,

1172
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,800
or you're not right. And I'm like, no,

1173
01:18:54,801 --> 01:18:57,560
I wasn't even trying to say anything
that I'm right. I'm just telling,

1174
01:18:57,561 --> 01:19:01,580
I was saying I don't actually even
know. Yeah. And, and so, yeah,

1175
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:06,560
I'm not certainly an expert
on how to overcome, you know,

1176
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:07,910
horrible situations,

1177
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:11,690
but I've been in some pretty horrible
situations and this is what my thoughts

1178
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:15,680
tried to be.
And it's not always easy at all.

1179
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:20,510
Yeah. Jordan Peterson has
some good, good, um, you know,

1180
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:24,350
good content on that where he's
basically in a nutshell, he says,

1181
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:29,090
get yourself together. Where in his
example, one of the men, it was, you know,

1182
01:19:29,091 --> 01:19:32,450
a family member dies or whatever,
get yourself together. So, you know,

1183
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:32,991
what are you going to do?

1184
01:19:32,991 --> 01:19:37,100
Are you going to wallow with the rest
of the people so no one can get ahold of

1185
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:38,750
anything in the funerals,
a mess or whatever.

1186
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,210
Or are you going to get yourself
together? Grief for sure, game,

1187
01:19:41,211 --> 01:19:45,890
but get yourself together so you can
kind of lead and get the funeral together

1188
01:19:45,891 --> 01:19:50,720
and take care of the business. And it's
such a cold blooded thing to say, right?

1189
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:55,790
It's the complete, and that's
what I think is hard about it is,

1190
01:19:55,970 --> 01:19:59,470
you know, think about this, Oh, if someone
in your family died and I was like, Echo,

1191
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,930
get yourself together. Right. You know
what I mean? Like I who says that,

1192
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:06,090
but that's probably the best thing
I could possibly say to, you know,

1193
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:09,240
I might need to say it in a more
tactful way, right? I may just say, Hey,

1194
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:13,530
echo man off feel for you. Hey
Man, what we need to do is grieve,

1195
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,480
but we also need to focus on moving
forward. You know what I mean?

1196
01:20:15,481 --> 01:20:18,570
It's that kind of thing. But the
reality is, what am I really saying?

1197
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:22,290
I'm really saying, Hey, get yourself
together. You got to move on.

1198
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,950
We got to move on, we got to move forward.
You got to move forward in your life.

1199
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:29,230
And that's like such a hard
thing to say to somebody. Yeah.

1200
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:33,840
That's probably the right
attitude to take is okay,

1201
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:38,700
like this is horrible and I
need to keep it together. Yeah,

1202
01:20:39,930 --> 01:20:42,160
yeah,
yeah man.

1203
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:47,810
Especially when there's no majorly
prevalent things that are at risk at that

1204
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:49,980
moment as well.
Like you know,

1205
01:20:49,981 --> 01:20:53,120
like why you're sitting with like
in a combat situation, I think, uh,

1206
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:55,140
BTF Tony was talking about this one.

1207
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:58,020
If like you're in a firefight or
something like that and some gets hit,

1208
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:02,880
you don't just quit. No exit. The
firefighting beauty. Oh my gosh,

1209
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:06,990
my guys hit use it. It's like, okay, he's
hit boom, let's continue the firefight.

1210
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:10,290
But let's say there was no firefight,
then the guy gets hit. It's,

1211
01:21:10,440 --> 01:21:14,250
it's seems like a harder thing to,
to just move on.

1212
01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:16,350
So what are you finding
need is you need to, like,

1213
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:21,330
you need to have a firefight going
on so that you can say, okay,

1214
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:23,520
I'm going to deal with this,

1215
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:28,800
but I need to also think about
the rest of life so hard.

1216
01:21:28,801 --> 01:21:31,480
And you know, again it's, it's, I,

1217
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,100
you know what I'm feeling like right now
I get some social media sometimes where

1218
01:21:35,101 --> 01:21:37,380
someone will say, Hey, I'm not a vet,

1219
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:40,890
but like a friend of mine is going through
problems and I don't know how to talk

1220
01:21:40,891 --> 01:21:43,050
to them cause I'm not a vet. And that's
kind of like what I feel like right now.

1221
01:21:43,051 --> 01:21:45,010
Like I haven't been through
those kinds of suffering,

1222
01:21:45,011 --> 01:21:49,590
so I'm throwing darts but I'm
throwing them based on what I know.

1223
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:53,760
So it's the best like, you know,
yeah, best I could do right now. You

1224
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:56,970
like you're at risk of someone saying,
hey,

1225
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,160
you simply don't understand
when the fact is there.

1226
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:03,970
My by my statement of that would be
yes, I don't understand. You know,

1227
01:22:03,990 --> 01:22:08,310
it's like in the, when I was talking
to veterans saying, look, people,

1228
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:11,910
you feel like people don't understand.
They don't. And that's okay.

1229
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:15,420
And so definitely not sitting
here saying, Oh, uh, you know,

1230
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:18,880
I know this is what you do in a situation
like that. I know. I don't know. Yeah,

1231
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,850
I don't know what you do when your
family members suffer something egregious

1232
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:28,650
like that, like a terminal
disease or death. I don't
know, haven't been through it.

1233
01:22:29,970 --> 01:22:34,830
What I have been through as losing guys
in combat that I have been through this

1234
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:38,460
is this is darkness.
It's a different kind of darkness.

1235
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:44,480
But this is what I did in those situations
and that's what I would think would

1236
01:22:48,091 --> 01:22:52,500
help you in these other situations.
Hard. It's just the question, right?

1237
01:22:52,501 --> 01:22:54,570
What do you mean? What do
you do hard? And we are,

1238
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:59,720
we are sitting here reading a book by a
guy that was in a concentration camp and

1239
01:23:00,061 --> 01:23:03,930
he's saying this thing to
do, you know? So that's,

1240
01:23:09,050 --> 01:23:13,940
that's another sort of reinforcement
of this thought pattern.

1241
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,430
Yeah.
All right.

1242
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:22,450
He talks a little bit about the passage
of time here in camp or a small unit of

1243
01:23:23,151 --> 01:23:25,250
time a day.
For example,

1244
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:29,360
filled with hourly tortures
and fatigue appeared endless.

1245
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:34,550
A larger time unit, perhaps a
week seemed to pass very quickly.

1246
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:40,450
My comrades agreed when I said that in
the camp a day lasted longer than a week.

1247
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:46,810
How paradoxical was our time experience?
And that's something,

1248
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:50,400
this actually reminded me, I was
talking to us, Sarah Armstrong and she,

1249
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:54,790
well now it's actually
around the conversation when
Leif was talking about he'd

1250
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,920
come out here and seeing all my kids,

1251
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:01,330
my kids are all grown up now basically
except for my littlest one. But you know,

1252
01:24:01,331 --> 01:24:03,260
my oldest daughter's graduating
high school, you know,

1253
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,010
a couple of weeks and she's going
to go to college. And you know,

1254
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:10,780
when Lafe met her, she was,
what was that, 12 years ago?

1255
01:24:10,781 --> 01:24:15,420
So she was, you know, no,

1256
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:19,680
six, six, something
like that. So you know,

1257
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:22,320
younger than me. And when
he came out here, you know,

1258
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:26,640
he'd just come left his apartment in New
York City where he's got his wife and

1259
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:27,930
kids and there and you know,

1260
01:24:27,931 --> 01:24:31,040
it's chaos and the little kids and
they're crying and screaming and spilling

1261
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:34,320
stuff and throwing up milk and pissing
everywhere. And it's just, you know, it's,

1262
01:24:34,410 --> 01:24:37,380
that's what life is when you're a parent.
And you know,

1263
01:24:37,381 --> 01:24:41,190
he came out here and saw how my
kids were now grown up and those,

1264
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:45,780
that time has gone by the way,
gone can't get it back. And,

1265
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:49,140
and he, you know, he talked about
it on the podcast, just, hey man,

1266
01:24:49,141 --> 01:24:52,200
make sure you appreciate those.
And Sarah Armstrong, you know,

1267
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:56,580
said something along the lines of, uh, the
days are long, but the years are short.

1268
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:01,180
That's a very true statement. And
you can, you can see that cure.

1269
01:25:01,181 --> 01:25:02,340
It's the same thing,
you know,

1270
01:25:02,341 --> 01:25:06,180
all of a sudden this time
is just going by so quickly.

1271
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,900
This is starting to talk
again back to the attitude.

1272
01:25:15,901 --> 01:25:19,020
We could say that most men in a
concentration camp believe that the,

1273
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:23,340
the real opportunities of life had passed.
Yet in reality,

1274
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,620
there was an opportunity and a challenge.

1275
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,980
One could make a victory of
those experiences turning
life into an inner triumph

1276
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:36,860
or one could ignore the challenges in
simply vegetate as did a majority of the

1277
01:25:38,521 --> 01:25:42,360
prisoners. Same. Same thing, same
topic. I know what's interesting,

1278
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,550
and I told you this before we started
this book, you know, is a great book,

1279
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:49,710
but I,

1280
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:55,190
I kind of wanted to talk about how bad
concentration camps were and I went and

1281
01:25:55,441 --> 01:26:00,441
found some other sources for that because
Viktor Frankl doesn't highlight it

1282
01:26:02,250 --> 01:26:06,130
that much. I his ad, I mean, he was
in Auschwitz for crying out loud. Hmm.

1283
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:10,190
It doesn't get any worse.
And you know,

1284
01:26:10,191 --> 01:26:13,100
to really give the
impact of how bad it was,

1285
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:15,170
I went and found some other
sources that were a little bit,

1286
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:20,030
a little bit more directly written
and a little bit more horrifying,

1287
01:26:20,031 --> 01:26:24,380
to be lack of a better word
because in his accounts,

1288
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:27,080
he doesn't go into those,
some of those graphic details,

1289
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:31,010
which I feel like you should know and you
should understand what before you talk

1290
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:33,950
about, hey, he's keeping a good
attitude. But no, no it's not.

1291
01:26:33,951 --> 01:26:36,020
He's keeping a good attitude cause
he was in a concentration camp,

1292
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:38,400
but I wasn't that bad. No,
it was freaking hell. Yeah.

1293
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:41,120
And that's what he's dealing with.
And in his mind,

1294
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:45,530
you could make a triumph or a
victory out of those experiences,

1295
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:50,200
which is incredible attitude to have.
Yeah.

1296
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:59,890
Going back to the book, the prisoner
who had lost faith in the future,

1297
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,160
his future was doomed with his
loss of belief in the future.

1298
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:07,270
He also lost his spiritual Holt.

1299
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:12,480
He let himself decline and became
subject to mental and physical decay.

1300
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:17,170
Usually this happened quite
suddenly in the form of a crisis.

1301
01:27:17,380 --> 01:27:21,400
The symptoms of which were familiar
to the experienced camp inmate.

1302
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:25,840
We all feared this moment,
not for ourselves, which
would have been pointless,

1303
01:27:25,841 --> 01:27:26,980
but for our friends,

1304
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:32,260
usually it began with the
prisoner refusing one morning
to get dressed and wash

1305
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:37,030
or to go out on the parade
grounds. No entreaties, no blows,

1306
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:41,590
no threats had any effect. He
just laid there, hardly moving.

1307
01:27:42,580 --> 01:27:44,890
If this crisis was brought
about by an illness,

1308
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:49,510
he refused to be taken to the sick
bay or do anything to help himself.

1309
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:52,990
He simply gave up
there.

1310
01:27:52,991 --> 01:27:57,991
He remained lying in his own extra extra
to and nothing bothered him anymore.

1311
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,250
And that's similar to
what colonel reader said.

1312
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:09,930
How if you didn't actively stay alive,
you would die.

1313
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,890
You couldn't just passively exist,
you weren't going to make it.

1314
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,920
If you want to die, all you had to do was
stop trying, then you are going to die

1315
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:22,030
back to the book.
As we said before,

1316
01:28:22,240 --> 01:28:27,160
any attempt to restore a man's inner
strength in the camp had to first succeed

1317
01:28:27,161 --> 01:28:29,500
in showing him some future goal.

1318
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,170
In Nietzsche's words,

1319
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:38,100
he who has a why to live for
can bear with almost any how

1320
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:47,910
that could be the guiding motto for all
psychotherapeutic and psycho hygienic

1321
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:53,170
efforts regarding prisoners.
Whenever there was an opportunity for it,

1322
01:28:53,171 --> 01:28:55,210
one had to give them a why,

1323
01:28:55,420 --> 01:29:00,420
an aim for their lives in
order to strengthen them
to bear the terrible how of

1324
01:29:00,821 --> 01:29:01,770
their existence.

1325
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:07,020
Woe to him who saw no more
sense in his life, no aim,

1326
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:10,530
no purpose.
And therefore no point to carrying on.

1327
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:16,710
He was soon lost. Got To know why
you're doing what you're doing.

1328
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,230
And that's all there is to it.

1329
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:24,420
He who has a why to live for
can bear with almost any how.

1330
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:29,340
And obviously that translates right
into a leadership perspective.

1331
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:31,380
Making sure people understand why
they're doing what they're doing.

1332
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:34,860
You just don't bark orders at them.
But from an individual perspective,

1333
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:39,150
why are you doing this?
Find that.

1334
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:42,580
And I actually,
I actually made a,

1335
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:47,590
a a a post on social media the other day
and it was something along the lines of

1336
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:54,810
finding your inner y or something
like that. Sure. And I was, I was,

1337
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:59,340
uh, you know, mocking that
attitude. And I was saying,

1338
01:29:59,490 --> 01:29:59,821
you know,

1339
01:29:59,821 --> 01:30:02,940
sometimes my inner voice is trying to
find out why I'm doing what I'm doing.

1340
01:30:02,941 --> 01:30:05,280
And I'm like,
when I'm doing something hard,

1341
01:30:05,281 --> 01:30:09,150
my inner voice doesn't allowed to talk
and be quiet. I'm over here working,

1342
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:11,240
you know.
Um,

1343
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:17,570
but there is obviously just like a
leadership perspective and from a personal

1344
01:30:17,671 --> 01:30:19,710
perspective,
why are you doing what you're doing?

1345
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:24,180
And that should be the driving force.
And if you don't have that,

1346
01:30:24,330 --> 01:30:25,920
it's hard to overcome these challenges.

1347
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:29,050
You can't just overcome challenges
just because you know they're there.

1348
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:33,120
You need some greater reason.
Yeah, and when that gets lost,

1349
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:35,543
you get lost.

1350
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:40,920
I don't know why I thought those.
I think the

1351
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,170
when,
why you were mocking that

1352
01:30:44,570 --> 01:30:48,080
this is my why and my inner
voice. It wasn't, it wasn't,
now that I think about it,

1353
01:30:48,081 --> 01:30:52,250
it wasn't really the why thing. It was
more about the inner, the inner room.

1354
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:55,080
Oh, the inner voice. But yeah, no,
I definitely said why in there too,

1355
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:57,960
because I think people do you like,

1356
01:30:58,230 --> 01:31:02,760
it's like a lot of good expressions or
sayings or whatever, or people just, Oh,

1357
01:31:02,761 --> 01:31:05,100
I liked that.
And they'll just start throwing it out in,

1358
01:31:05,101 --> 01:31:08,160
abusing it and it dumbs it down and
then not everyone's saying it now.

1359
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:11,190
It just sorta sounds cheesy
because no one's actually doing it.

1360
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:15,310
No one's actually understanding the
real, what it really means. You know?

1361
01:31:15,311 --> 01:31:18,780
Like the person who's like, Hey, I'm
going to lose weight, and you know,

1362
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:22,110
they've basically spent their life
neglecting their health or whatever.

1363
01:31:22,111 --> 01:31:24,300
Then they're like, okay, I'm going to,
you know, I'm going to get in shape.

1364
01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:29,550
And then they go on this, you
know, program, they quit, you know,

1365
01:31:29,551 --> 01:31:31,420
but when they're doing
good on the pertinent,

1366
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,500
let's say the first or second day
they'll be like, this is my why.

1367
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:37,800
And they'll show their, I don't know,
their, their dog or something like that.

1368
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:40,410
My why or my kids or whatever,
you know.

1369
01:31:40,890 --> 01:31:43,170
But then the next day
they quit the program.

1370
01:31:43,171 --> 01:31:45,660
Like it's such a weak thing and
you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1371
01:31:45,661 --> 01:31:50,130
You can't just do that. You know, like
that the whole thing, my y or whatever.

1372
01:31:50,131 --> 01:31:52,380
That's way too powerful
for people to just be like,

1373
01:31:52,381 --> 01:31:53,940
hey my white and then just not do,

1374
01:31:53,950 --> 01:31:58,020
it shouldn't be just like a little
thing can just throw together a, uh,

1375
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,370
38 second into Instagram

1376
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:05,080
posts. That's about your why you need
to dig. Yeah. You got to do that stuff.

1377
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:09,850
So that's why it's funny because
like people just throw that out. No,

1378
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:14,320
no means like nothing. And it's, it's
almost like they seen, it seems like,

1379
01:32:14,321 --> 01:32:16,840
it seems like it's totally
my interpretation of it.

1380
01:32:16,870 --> 01:32:21,870
But it seems like they're saying it and
thinking that they sound so profound and

1381
01:32:22,390 --> 01:32:26,770
deep and new, an inspirational, you
know, but everyone's seen it end to,

1382
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,660
to counter your point,

1383
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:33,970
I've had plenty of people that
have talked to me about, you know,

1384
01:32:33,971 --> 01:32:36,160
I was in bad shape.
I wasn't taking care of myself.

1385
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:40,900
I wasn't healthy and had my
first kid and I said to myself,

1386
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,570
I need dude, I need to
be there for my kid. Or,

1387
01:32:43,571 --> 01:32:45,400
or I was doing bad at work
and I didn't really care.

1388
01:32:45,401 --> 01:32:48,220
And it wasn't focused on my career and
it wasn't focused on being squared away

1389
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:51,470
and I was wasting all my money on dumb
stuff. And I had my first kid. Yeah.

1390
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:53,230
And then I said, I got to, you know, this,

1391
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:56,410
this is me taking care of my kid
and I need to do a damn good job.

1392
01:32:56,530 --> 01:33:00,310
And that's exactly the point right
there is that the, it's a real thing.

1393
01:33:00,490 --> 01:33:01,660
And if that's for real,
you're,

1394
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:06,280
you're why conceptually now I'm just
saying the expression. Sure. For sure.

1395
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:08,070
But there's a big difference between the,
well,

1396
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,050
there's a big difference between
the contemplation that goes into,

1397
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:14,230
I'm doing this for my kid. It's cool.
Yeah, I'm going to go on weight watchers.

1398
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:18,520
Right? It's like, um, no.
Like, think about this.

1399
01:33:18,521 --> 01:33:21,910
Think about your relationship with your
children and where you're going to end

1400
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:25,270
up and now you want to see them live
and what guidance you can give them as

1401
01:33:25,271 --> 01:33:27,310
human beings and the example
that you're setting for them,

1402
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:31,540
and you align all those things up.
Then maybe you can put down the doughnuts.

1403
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,900
Yeah, exactly right. In other words, you
got to do it. Yeah. Actually, you know,

1404
01:33:34,901 --> 01:33:39,280
so yeah. That's why it just sounds cheesy
because everyone does it. He says it.

1405
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,940
This is a great section.
Going back to the book,

1406
01:33:42,941 --> 01:33:46,360
we had to learn ourselves and furthermore,

1407
01:33:46,660 --> 01:33:51,660
we had to teach the despairing men
that it did not really matter what we

1408
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:53,320
expected from life,

1409
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:57,460
but rather what life expected from us.

1410
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:03,200
We needed to stop asking you about the
meaning of life and instead to think of

1411
01:34:03,201 --> 01:34:08,201
ourselves as those who were being
questioned by life daily and hourly.

1412
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:14,210
One answer must consist
not in talk and meditation,

1413
01:34:14,450 --> 01:34:17,510
but in a right action and right conduct.

1414
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:24,260
Life ultimately means taking
the responsibility to find
the right answer to its

1415
01:34:24,261 --> 01:34:29,261
problems and to fulfill the tasks which
it constantly sets for each individual.

1416
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:34,250
Again, you're turning your
flipping this idea around,

1417
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,140
it's not about what I want from life,
it's what, what does life want from me?

1418
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:42,380
And it's putting these challenges in
these hurdles in front of me and I got to

1419
01:34:42,381 --> 01:34:47,381
go and jump over him and then I got to
smash them and then I've got to set fire

1420
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:50,810
to them and then I got to use that fire
to fuel the domination of everything

1421
01:34:50,811 --> 01:34:55,190
that's in my path. Is it Kinda like, hey,

1422
01:34:55,191 --> 01:34:58,070
these weights aren't going to
lift themselves the exact same

1423
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,930
thing.
It's the exact same thing.

1424
01:35:02,260 --> 01:35:03,093
Yeah.

1425
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:06,890
And again,

1426
01:35:06,891 --> 01:35:11,891
going back to this idea of that
war reveals human nature and,

1427
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,920
and this is Dr Frankel's way of putting
this exact same thing that I say back to

1428
01:35:20,271 --> 01:35:25,271
the book of life in a concentration camp
tore open the human soul and exposed

1429
01:35:25,491 --> 01:35:27,800
it's depths.
It is.

1430
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:33,850
Is it surprising that in those depths
we again found only human qualities,

1431
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:39,971
which in their very nature we're
a mixture of good and evil.

1432
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:46,940
The rift dividing good from evil,
which goes through all human beings,

1433
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,590
reaches into the lowest depths and
becomes a parent even on the bottom of the

1434
01:35:51,591 --> 01:35:55,580
abyss, which is laid open
by the concentration camp.

1435
01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:04,990
So we've got this idea once again
that there's a dichotomy in people,

1436
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:08,930
in people,

1437
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:14,050
this dichotomy that you're capable of
doing extreme good and you're capable of

1438
01:36:14,181 --> 01:36:16,970
doing extreme evil.
And we've seen it a bunch,

1439
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:20,180
we've seen it a bunch on this podcast

1440
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:23,430
be you look them Ui massacre.

1441
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:29,540
Those guys were normal guys
that committed extreme evil,

1442
01:36:31,380 --> 01:36:32,490
straight up evil.

1443
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:33,773
Hmm.

1444
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:38,030
Normal guys that were,
you know,

1445
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:43,090
four days earlier probably would have
done something heroic to save someone.

1446
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:46,640
Yeah. And here they are, the
other end of the spectrum.

1447
01:36:49,180 --> 01:36:51,280
And I think that you have to,

1448
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:56,320
we have to face that not only
individually do you have that,

1449
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,740
but then obviously as the group you
have that as a group of human beings,

1450
01:36:59,741 --> 01:37:02,080
we have that capability and we've
seen it over and over again.

1451
01:37:02,350 --> 01:37:04,450
And if you want to know
what that good part is,

1452
01:37:04,451 --> 01:37:06,030
you got to know what that darkness is too.

1453
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:11,290
Yeah, yeah. The group
thing is interesting. Like,

1454
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:13,260
you know, you know how you
always see it, not always,

1455
01:37:13,261 --> 01:37:17,190
but you hear sometimes about
these riots on college campuses,

1456
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,590
whether it be after game
or something like that.

1457
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:25,740
At a glance you'd think, Dang, is this
college fill of full of just hooligans?

1458
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,930
Like if this bit like huge riots,
you know,

1459
01:37:28,110 --> 01:37:31,320
but it's that it's like as
an individual or you know,

1460
01:37:31,321 --> 01:37:34,740
under quote unquote normal circumstances,
they just, they're just normal people.

1461
01:37:34,741 --> 01:37:38,310
Yeah. You know, guys, girls,
whatever, they're just normal people.

1462
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,780
But then you put them in this particular
situation in some way extreme or

1463
01:37:42,781 --> 01:37:46,820
whatever, you know, it's a spectrum but,
and they just act different. And the,

1464
01:37:46,821 --> 01:37:49,290
the whole group dynamic to act different

1465
01:37:50,010 --> 01:37:54,780
Hammock is a, uh, is, it can
be a very, very scary thing.

1466
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:56,040
Mm.
There's

1467
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,940
no doubt. It can be a very, very scary
thing. And that's, that's why, you know,

1468
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:01,110
even when he's talking about,

1469
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:04,320
and I mentioned this on when I was on
Joe Rogan's last podcast, I'm like this,

1470
01:38:04,321 --> 01:38:08,230
the idea of individual freedom
and acting as an individual yeah.

1471
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,510
Is so important.

1472
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:11,860
Yeah.

1473
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:16,240
As to, to structure your life around, to
say, look, I'm not part of this group.

1474
01:38:16,330 --> 01:38:20,710
This group is not me. This group
is not me. They don't represent me.

1475
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:26,020
I represent me and I'm,
I have my own individual choices.

1476
01:38:26,110 --> 01:38:30,100
And that's what he saying in here. The
minute you give away to the herd, yeah.

1477
01:38:30,670 --> 01:38:34,120
That's when you start going, you
don't know. You no longer control it.

1478
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:37,060
And when you give up that control,
that's a scary, scary thing.

1479
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:40,400
And that's when these evil
things take place. And that,

1480
01:38:42,220 --> 01:38:44,140
once again, it's, it's like,

1481
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:49,000
it's easy to say no because grouping
yourself is actually a survival mechanism.

1482
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:52,240
True. Sold you, you know, it's
not going to be just that.

1483
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:55,690
You're not going to naturally just be
an individual and act like an individual

1484
01:38:55,691 --> 01:38:59,620
and conduct yourself in all of these
extreme situations as an individual,

1485
01:38:59,621 --> 01:39:04,390
not just going to naturally true.
So I guess it just helps to,

1486
01:39:04,420 --> 01:39:06,610
to know these things.
That's your,

1487
01:39:06,611 --> 01:39:10,390
you're 100% right on both
facets. Number one, yes.

1488
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:14,890
Grouping and fitting in is a
survival instinct that people have.

1489
01:39:14,891 --> 01:39:19,840
And that's why trends happen. And that's
why nations happened. And that's why,

1490
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:21,910
that's why groups occurred.

1491
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,980
People and politics. Yeah, new
politics and in everything,

1492
01:39:26,981 --> 01:39:28,000
right?
To get these groups.

1493
01:39:28,001 --> 01:39:31,210
And I mean it's weird now because
with the Internet you can have groups,

1494
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:33,930
you can be part of these
groups autonomously,

1495
01:39:35,160 --> 01:39:37,090
then you can connect with
all these different people.

1496
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:40,870
But it's also important
to make sure that you,

1497
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:46,140
you do remember that you are
an individual then candy,

1498
01:39:46,211 --> 01:39:51,211
that you don't want to give up that
last shred of human will to decide

1499
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,170
what your attitude is going to
be. Dang. And today, you know,

1500
01:39:57,171 --> 01:39:58,760
in our luxurious society,

1501
01:39:58,850 --> 01:40:03,850
if you can consciously navigate your
waist clear that have of falling into the

1502
01:40:04,371 --> 01:40:07,280
group trap is what it is.
It's a trap because you don't have,

1503
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:12,590
if you can do that successfully,
probably won't fall for the tricks man.

1504
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:14,480
Like that's the thing.
You get air,

1505
01:40:14,481 --> 01:40:19,130
we all get trick all the way down to
just something as seemingly benign as

1506
01:40:19,131 --> 01:40:22,970
marketing. Just man, you'll
just fall for way less tricks.

1507
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:26,870
You don't like those tricks out there
in the world. Do you know? I don't

1508
01:40:28,430 --> 01:40:33,110
probably fell for too many
of them. I think this is a,

1509
01:40:33,230 --> 01:40:35,450
I'm going to, I'm going to wrap
this book is this book is not long.

1510
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:39,440
It's a very fast read and,
and actually he goes into,

1511
01:40:40,240 --> 01:40:41,073
um,

1512
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:45,500
sort of goes into the
more of the psychological,

1513
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:50,460
the psychiatrist, the actual
academic of it. Then I covered, uh,

1514
01:40:50,570 --> 01:40:54,310
but this is a fast reader.
I mean it's only 150 pages

1515
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:59,310
or so and you definitely get
a raw look at human nature.

1516
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:04,570
But this closing I think is very,
very powerful. Going back to the book,

1517
01:41:04,630 --> 01:41:09,630
a human being is not
one thing among others,

1518
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,550
things determine each other.

1519
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:17,700
But man is ultimately self determining
what he becomes within the limits of

1520
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:25,261
endowment and environment
he has made out of himself

1521
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:29,410
in the concentration camps.
For example,

1522
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:34,530
in this living laboratory and on this
testing ground we watched and witnessed

1523
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:41,550
some of our comrades behave like swine
while others behaved like saints.

1524
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:45,640
Okay.

1525
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:50,080
Man has both potentiality.
He's within himself,

1526
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:53,380
which one is actualized,

1527
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:58,680
depends on decisions
but not on conditions.

1528
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:06,420
Our generation is realistic for we
have come to know man as he really is

1529
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:13,770
after all man is that being who
invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz.

1530
01:42:17,010 --> 01:42:17,843
However,

1531
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:23,660
he is also that being who entered those
gas chambers upright with the Lord's

1532
01:42:25,831 --> 01:42:30,831
prayer or the Shamah Israel on his lips.

1533
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:35,573
Okay.

1534
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:42,250
And I think that fought,

1535
01:42:43,480 --> 01:42:48,480
that man has both potentiality is within
himself and we've seen them over and

1536
01:42:51,491 --> 01:42:54,850
over again.
These grand

1537
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:01,860
expanded potentiality in extreme display
and we've talked about these situations

1538
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:06,400
in the podcast over and over again.

1539
01:43:06,401 --> 01:43:11,401
And the the Burma railway that was
built by the prisoners of war and the

1540
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:15,400
prisoners of war war,

1541
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:19,150
tortured and killed by the Japanese
and the genocide in Rwanda.

1542
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:22,510
And the rape of Nan King.
And we've also seen

1543
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:28,120
the other
potentiality.

1544
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,950
And we've seen that over and over again
that that potentiality of goodness

1545
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,090
and of sacrifice

1546
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:47,390
Lowe's men that we've seen over and over
again that laid down their lives for

1547
01:43:47,791 --> 01:43:48,624
their brothers.

1548
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:51,103
And,

1549
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:54,470
and in doing so,
protect our freedom.

1550
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:00,930
But it's important to note that again,

1551
01:44:00,931 --> 01:44:05,931
that whether the good or
the evil is actualized

1552
01:44:08,280 --> 01:44:13,280
in the minds of men that is not
based on conditions but on decisions.

1553
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,433
Okay?

1554
01:44:17,950 --> 01:44:21,370
In this doesn't only apply to good
and evil, of course, that's the,

1555
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:26,590
that's the most expansive fought
that we can apply this to.

1556
01:44:26,591 --> 01:44:31,591
But it also applies to everything
we choose to do or choose not to do.

1557
01:44:32,230 --> 01:44:36,700
And everything we choose
to become or not to become.

1558
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:43,980
It's us.
It's our choice.

1559
01:44:43,981 --> 01:44:46,560
And we are responsible.

1560
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:54,360
We are responsible to
be good instead of evil,

1561
01:44:54,361 --> 01:44:56,460
to be strong instead of weak,

1562
01:44:56,490 --> 01:45:00,180
to become what we want to become,

1563
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,250
not what we let ourselves become.

1564
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:09,650
We own the course.

1565
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,060
And with every decision that we make,
we actualize ourselves.

1566
01:45:18,061 --> 01:45:20,760
We become what we choose,

1567
01:45:24,450 --> 01:45:25,380
swine

1568
01:45:28,990 --> 01:45:29,830
or saints.

1569
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:38,360
So when you make decisions,

1570
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:40,220
every decision think,

1571
01:45:43,350 --> 01:45:48,350
think about where that decision leads
and what that decision will make you

1572
01:45:51,781 --> 01:45:52,614
become.

1573
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:59,410
And then self determine,

1574
01:46:01,050 --> 01:46:03,490
self determined,
choose

1575
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:08,870
what will make you a better person.

1576
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:17,420
Then even in situations where you
feel you have no choice at all,

1577
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:20,700
you still have one last freedom.

1578
01:46:20,701 --> 01:46:25,701
And that is to choose your own attitude
in any given set of circumstances.

1579
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:36,430
Keep
that choice,

1580
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:40,810
keep that freedom,
that hard choice,

1581
01:46:42,700 --> 01:46:44,710
the disciplined choice

1582
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:53,460
and with the discipline
to make the right choice.

1583
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:55,920
Maintain

1584
01:46:58,820 --> 01:46:59,653
your freedom.

1585
01:47:07,660 --> 01:47:12,560
I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1586
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,060
Powerful book.
Yeah.

1587
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:23,100
Isn't it crazy how,
I can't help but think of this like where,

1588
01:47:24,150 --> 01:47:28,260
how they talk about the,
the SS officers, the Nazis,

1589
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:33,150
the guys there who are savages obviously,

1590
01:47:33,360 --> 01:47:38,360
but are they really savages as people
will or is it a circumstantial thing?

1591
01:47:39,160 --> 01:47:41,880
I mean I know they're trained to
kind of regard this, you know,

1592
01:47:42,150 --> 01:47:45,360
the Jews are these groups of people as
you know, beneath them and all this stuff.

1593
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:50,361
But like are they savages just as individ
cause it takes a savage to do some of

1594
01:47:51,241 --> 01:47:54,750
this stuff. You know, especially like
grabbing a baby and smashing his,

1595
01:47:55,320 --> 01:48:00,000
as the book said skull against the wall.
That's like sub human behavior,

1596
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:03,960
you know, but when he goes home, you know,

1597
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:08,640
he has kids, you know, is he like, yeah, I
don't care if the, these kids ultimately,

1598
01:48:08,641 --> 01:48:11,100
if their heads get, but you know,
I'm sure he's not like that.

1599
01:48:11,101 --> 01:48:14,460
I'm sure he's just a normal person
would just be just as weak as all of us.

1600
01:48:14,461 --> 01:48:19,440
If your kid stubs it toe
and starts crying, you know,

1601
01:48:19,820 --> 01:48:20,870
well,
we're going to explore,

1602
01:48:20,871 --> 01:48:25,730
I got some books in the queue to explore
the other side of this and they're very

1603
01:48:25,731 --> 01:48:29,390
revealing about some of
that. But again, it's, it's,

1604
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:34,190
you're right that some of these guys,
you know,

1605
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:38,360
we're, we're normal, right?

1606
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:42,530
Some of these Nazis were normal and they
were doing their job and that's one of

1607
01:48:42,531 --> 01:48:47,040
the worst. You know, there's
a whole, there's a whole, uh,

1608
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:52,520
argument on whether that even is
allowable. Like if you're doing your job,

1609
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:56,060
and I'll tell you what, in
the u s military you, that
doesn't, that doesn't work.

1610
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:58,940
That's an excuse that we don't
have. You can't say, Hey,

1611
01:48:58,941 --> 01:49:03,530
I got ordered to do this thing that
was against the law or against ethical

1612
01:49:03,531 --> 01:49:07,340
values. Doesn't matter. I still
can't do it. That's not an excuse.

1613
01:49:07,341 --> 01:49:11,090
And that came directly from this
attitude that Nazi said, Hey,

1614
01:49:11,091 --> 01:49:12,470
I was just following
orders, you know, hey,

1615
01:49:12,471 --> 01:49:14,660
it wasn't my fault as just fallen
orders. No, actually you can't,

1616
01:49:14,661 --> 01:49:16,360
you can't say that. You're
not allowed to say that. Yeah.

1617
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:21,020
So as far as the normalicy sure.
They might've been normal,

1618
01:49:21,080 --> 01:49:24,710
normal when they went home, but that
doesn't remove their guilt at all. Yeah,

1619
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:28,400
fully. And you can't take a baby and
smashed his head against the wall.

1620
01:49:28,410 --> 01:49:31,830
You don't get a pass on that one
whether you ordered to do it or not. No.

1621
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:36,710
There's certain moral standards that
exist and you can't violate them.

1622
01:49:36,711 --> 01:49:39,230
And if you do, you're guilty. It
doesn't matter what else you did

1623
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:43,240
back then. Who, who was Kinda
the, the, the, the, you know,

1624
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:47,950
the authority on that. Like where the
moral, was it like a global, you know,

1625
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:51,190
or is it because obviously Hitler, it
was B would be like, Hey, I'm whatever.

1626
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:56,760
Well, there's different societies
that had different viewpoints,

1627
01:49:56,770 --> 01:49:59,830
obviously did not war.
Hence the war.

1628
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:03,640
The Nazis and the Japanese both felt,
okay,

1629
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:07,900
we can do what we need to do to dominate
and whether that's the rape and Nan

1630
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:11,110
King or whether that's the concentration
camps and the final solution.

1631
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:15,370
Both those things were in their
societies. Now there was, of course,

1632
01:50:15,371 --> 01:50:19,930
there was people inside those societies
and I don't know. I haven't, I haven't,

1633
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:21,280
I don't know of any Japanese.

1634
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:23,280
I'm sure there were some Japanese
that that were against I,

1635
01:50:23,281 --> 01:50:26,890
and even when we'd read the raping and
King, there was a Nazi in Nan King.

1636
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:30,310
Remember that sheltered people.
So there's an example.

1637
01:50:30,510 --> 01:50:34,000
Here's a guy now he didn't know what was
going on with the final solution back

1638
01:50:34,001 --> 01:50:37,960
in Germany.
At least it doesn't appear that way.

1639
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:39,730
But yeah,

1640
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:44,731
this is what makes morality and
ethical decision making so challenging.

1641
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:48,670
But there is, in my opinion, you know,

1642
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:53,500
a certain standard moral code
that human beings live by. Yeah.

1643
01:50:53,740 --> 01:50:58,740
And that is a universal relatively unit.

1644
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:01,470
How that has now lasted, actually
you can say it's universal, right?

1645
01:51:01,540 --> 01:51:05,920
There's the way that I believe that
there's morals and standards that human

1646
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:10,600
beings should live by and when you start
stepping outside those bounds, you're,

1647
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:13,780
you're going on the wrong side.
Yeah. And like candy thing, men,

1648
01:51:13,781 --> 01:51:16,990
that's like obviously a spectrum
and then what you're talking about,

1649
01:51:16,991 --> 01:51:18,970
that universal line that you cross,

1650
01:51:18,971 --> 01:51:21,180
it's like actually when you really
look at the line, it's like a,

1651
01:51:21,190 --> 01:51:24,370
it's a universal gray area of
when you really look closer,

1652
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:29,880
but I think that the circumstances don't
really fall within the confines of that

1653
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:34,660
gray area very often. So it's easy
to be like, that's obviously right.

1654
01:51:34,720 --> 01:51:35,830
That's obviously wrong,

1655
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:39,670
but then every once in a while these
gray areas of emergent and it's like this

1656
01:51:39,671 --> 01:51:42,290
big debate and it depends on who you are.
I,

1657
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:45,220
I don't spend a lot of time in the
gray areas to be honest with you.

1658
01:51:45,221 --> 01:51:47,910
Like in my thought pattern, I don't spend
a lot of time in the careers, right.

1659
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:50,290
I spend time because to
me it is pretty obvious.

1660
01:51:50,650 --> 01:51:55,650
Like when your Isis and
you're systematically raping
a 12 year old girls and

1661
01:51:56,381 --> 01:52:00,280
boys, you don't get to live that.
That doesn't work. That's not that.

1662
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:03,250
It's not part of my deal.
Over here you, you, you die.

1663
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:07,360
And when you take people and you put
them in cages and you burn them to death,

1664
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,740
right.
Do you don't get to do that?

1665
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:12,880
Just like these Nazis that are putting
people in con, you don't get to do that.

1666
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:17,740
No. We go to war. We fight and we
win. That's the way it works. Now.

1667
01:52:17,741 --> 01:52:19,510
These grey areas that
you're talking about,

1668
01:52:19,570 --> 01:52:23,620
I don't mess around in those gray
areas. Yeah. I think there's too much.

1669
01:52:24,130 --> 01:52:26,620
There's too, there's turbulence
in there, right. And,

1670
01:52:26,621 --> 01:52:29,440
and a lot of times you look at it
from the outside and you don't,

1671
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:33,540
it's hard to tell what it is,
what it actually is happening
in there. Right aisle.

1672
01:52:34,510 --> 01:52:36,130
And maybe that's not the best policy,

1673
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:40,960
but I won't escalate something personally
until I see it go outside the lines of

1674
01:52:40,961 --> 01:52:44,440
what I deem to be. Okay. Yeah. You
know, once you get outside those lines,

1675
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,300
you're done. We'll, thankfully
you're, you're, you know,

1676
01:52:47,510 --> 01:52:51,170
a little bit smart in a way where,
you know,

1677
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:53,060
whether you name these things are not,

1678
01:52:53,061 --> 01:52:56,650
there's always a particular standard that
you go by. You know, so just like the,

1679
01:52:56,710 --> 01:53:00,920
like the difference between killing
someone and when someone says murder,

1680
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:04,250
you know, murderer is, uh,
is clearly defined. You know,

1681
01:53:04,251 --> 01:53:07,160
so if you murder someone,

1682
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:11,780
like killing someone is this broad thing,
you killed him, accidentally killed him,

1683
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:16,070
you killed him after planning, there's
a mill killed him, revenge and all that,

1684
01:53:16,071 --> 01:53:19,040
you know, that's killing someone.
But murder is defined, you know.

1685
01:53:19,041 --> 01:53:24,041
So while somebody asked me when I did
Tim Ferriss his second time and someone

1686
01:53:25,071 --> 01:53:28,670
asked me something along the lines
of, well, who defines these rules?

1687
01:53:28,671 --> 01:53:31,310
Which is basically what you just asked me.
And I think it actually,

1688
01:53:31,311 --> 01:53:33,500
there is an answer to who
defines these roles in warfare.

1689
01:53:33,710 --> 01:53:35,930
It's the law of armed conflict.
It's like the Geneva Convention.

1690
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:37,820
We follow those laws right there.

1691
01:53:37,830 --> 01:53:40,580
They're very clearly defined what you
can and can't do. Boom. That's it.

1692
01:53:40,581 --> 01:53:42,530
Next question. Yeah. And I mean,

1693
01:53:42,531 --> 01:53:46,090
unless you straight up disagree with
the Geneva Convention, you know,

1694
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:49,250
because of your personal moral code.
But as long as you have, again,

1695
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,250
a standard that you're going by,

1696
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:55,580
that will reduce the gray areas
by a lot and we'll be there.

1697
01:53:55,580 --> 01:53:59,120
But it's easy to operate in black and
white when you have standards and it won't

1698
01:53:59,121 --> 01:54:02,940
always be easy. But you
know, it's like, well let,

1699
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:04,660
let me this,
this,

1700
01:54:04,670 --> 01:54:06,700
when we start getting the gray area
and you're sitting here saying,

1701
01:54:06,730 --> 01:54:09,680
I'm all black and white and that's an,
I'm actually saying that like, Hey,

1702
01:54:09,681 --> 01:54:13,420
once you cross this line, but guess what?
Those lines can get blurry too. Yeah,

1703
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:14,263
that's what it was.

1704
01:54:14,420 --> 01:54:19,210
I heard about a guy that was on
a documentary who is, he was,

1705
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:22,610
he was in a western journalist of some
kind and I got to watch this documentary.

1706
01:54:22,611 --> 01:54:25,430
I'm sure someone will tell us what it is,
but somebody else told me about it.

1707
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:26,810
The Western journalist,

1708
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:31,930
he's imbedded with insurgents in Iraq and
he's filming and they're going out and

1709
01:54:35,481 --> 01:54:38,010
attacking coalition
forces thing. Yeah, right.

1710
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:41,960
And I guess he was, while
he's doing it, you know,

1711
01:54:41,961 --> 01:54:43,670
he's trying to get his
story and do his job,

1712
01:54:43,671 --> 01:54:45,980
but then all of a sudden they're
attacking coalition forces.

1713
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:47,330
Right now there's a gray area.

1714
01:54:47,331 --> 01:54:50,720
Now let's say if you want to
take that example to the extreme,

1715
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:56,440
if we're in a firefight and I see a guy
with a camera who's wearing of press

1716
01:54:56,541 --> 01:54:59,010
badge following in, in Third Gen, right?

1717
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:03,890
I mean it ain't gonna work out good for
him because it's not like I'm going to

1718
01:55:03,891 --> 01:55:06,350
say, okay, well I, you know,
he's clearly is within surgeons,

1719
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:07,940
but what I'm saying is that's,

1720
01:55:07,950 --> 01:55:12,950
that's one example of many that that you
could get into where also another thing

1721
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:17,210
that happened in Iraq a lot was
people change sides and they went from

1722
01:55:17,211 --> 01:55:20,150
supporting the terrorist to supporting
the coalition and then back again and

1723
01:55:20,151 --> 01:55:22,640
then back again.
So how do you,

1724
01:55:23,210 --> 01:55:25,460
how do you balance those?

1725
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:30,440
And I'll tell you how I balanced them
was how can we achieve our mission?

1726
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:35,510
And that sounds like one of those, hey,
mission focus. But it's true. I look at,

1727
01:55:35,511 --> 01:55:37,100
okay, this guy, you know,

1728
01:55:37,220 --> 01:55:42,220
a year ago was being targeted by
coalition forces for being a bad guy.

1729
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,040
Now

1730
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:45,420
he has changed course,

1731
01:55:45,930 --> 01:55:48,630
so what am I supposed to do still
prosecute him or is he going to help us

1732
01:55:48,631 --> 01:55:51,570
achieve our mission of overall victory?
Guess what I'm gonna do,

1733
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:56,910
I'm gonna cut him some moral
slack because we're going to win.

1734
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:00,270
So those are hard things to,
that's exactly what it mean.

1735
01:56:00,271 --> 01:56:01,410
They'll see the standard.

1736
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:06,360
The standard in your case
became the overall mission. Yes.

1737
01:56:06,450 --> 01:56:06,931
So you know,

1738
01:56:06,931 --> 01:56:09,780
you have that say it's not like just
some guy floating down the road through

1739
01:56:09,781 --> 01:56:13,290
life being like, Hey, I don't
feel good about that right
there, so I feel this way,

1740
01:56:13,291 --> 01:56:13,821
so I'm going to do it.

1741
01:56:13,821 --> 01:56:17,070
It's not that it's like there's a
standard very concrete attached to,

1742
01:56:17,071 --> 01:56:19,590
it's still gray areas gunny emerge.
But like I said,

1743
01:56:19,591 --> 01:56:23,610
it just reduces that gray area.
Yep. Standard in the bottom line is,

1744
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:26,490
this is why leadership is hard.
Yes.

1745
01:56:26,670 --> 01:56:28,680
The whole idea of leadership,

1746
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:32,490
whether it's in combat or whether it's
in the business world or whether it's

1747
01:56:32,491 --> 01:56:34,590
part of a team or whether it's part
of a family or whether it's in a

1748
01:56:34,591 --> 01:56:37,470
concentration camp or whether
it's in a prisoner of war.

1749
01:56:37,471 --> 01:56:42,330
Camp leadership is hard. There's gray
areas. Like when captain plumb was saying,

1750
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:45,150
Hey, he got told in order, you know,

1751
01:56:45,151 --> 01:56:50,151
make communications with this
guy at all costs at all costs,

1752
01:56:50,401 --> 01:56:54,330
that means I'm going to get beaten and
tortured and died by the guards to get

1753
01:56:54,331 --> 01:56:58,530
this guy, this piece of communication. Is
he going to follow that? Gus Smart? No.

1754
01:56:59,160 --> 01:57:02,970
He had to make a judgment and say, you
know what? No, that doesn't make sense.

1755
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:04,560
That doesn't make sense.

1756
01:57:04,680 --> 01:57:07,890
So this gray area that went outside the
bounds of the gray area and he said, Nah,

1757
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:10,860
I'll do my best.
I understand that it's critical,

1758
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:15,930
but I'm going to stay within
me staying alive. Right?

1759
01:57:17,100 --> 01:57:21,600
So that is what's makes leadership heart
is you have to constantly make these

1760
01:57:21,601 --> 01:57:26,100
decisions where there's they're gray
area and you're doing your best.

1761
01:57:26,101 --> 01:57:30,750
You're assessing. And that's, that's
again, to me it was always, I love that.

1762
01:57:30,900 --> 01:57:31,980
I love that about leadership.

1763
01:57:32,100 --> 01:57:35,940
I loved weighing those decisions out and
I love discussing them with my guys up

1764
01:57:35,941 --> 01:57:38,100
and down the chain of command and
saying, Hey, here's where we're at.

1765
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,110
Let me tell you exactly where we're at.
You know,

1766
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:44,130
I'll use Lafe Lafe here's what's going on.
This is the situation.

1767
01:57:44,131 --> 01:57:47,100
What do you think? Well, I think
this, okay, that's a good point.

1768
01:57:47,101 --> 01:57:49,350
But did you think about that? Ooh,
that's a good one. You know what I mean?

1769
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:53,190
We're going to have those conversations
and I had never had any problem opening

1770
01:57:53,191 --> 01:57:57,570
my mind up to these various opinions that
people have. And I think as a leader,

1771
01:57:57,571 --> 01:58:02,571
that's a huge piece of building trust
up and down the chain of command is when

1772
01:58:04,141 --> 01:58:06,300
you have an open mind to
discuss things with people.

1773
01:58:06,330 --> 01:58:09,960
And that also double gravitational pull.

1774
01:58:10,100 --> 01:58:12,360
Echo Charles helps you
build the relationship,

1775
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:15,570
helps you build the relationship and
helps you to say, oh, you know what,

1776
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:17,910
like what's the minute I'm in
there? I'm talking, I'm like, hey,

1777
01:58:17,911 --> 01:58:19,900
how we got a gray area here?
You know,

1778
01:58:19,901 --> 01:58:23,520
we got a customer that is
threatening to put us on Yelp,

1779
01:58:23,730 --> 01:58:28,440
but we didn't do anything wrong. How
do you think we should handle it? Okay,

1780
01:58:28,590 --> 01:58:32,100
well you think we should just tell them,
go ahead and put it on Yelp.

1781
01:58:32,820 --> 01:58:34,800
We don't care, and we'll go to
Yelp and we'll talk to them.

1782
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:38,970
That might be the good answer, but also
it might be good to say, Bro, wait,

1783
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:43,610
why are you so mad, right? Customer, let's
talk that, hey, we want a refund. You,

1784
01:58:43,620 --> 01:58:45,730
we want to take care of you because
our customers are important to us.

1785
01:58:45,850 --> 01:58:48,010
Maybe you'll give us a positive thing
on you. You know what I'm saying?

1786
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:50,000
There's all this gray area.
Yeah,

1787
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:54,370
and if you have an open mind to discuss
things with your team team up and down

1788
01:58:54,371 --> 01:58:57,520
the chain of command, you know what
you'll do is you'll, you'll get to,

1789
01:58:57,610 --> 01:59:01,510
in that gray area, you'll start to get
clarity. You'll start to get clarity.

1790
01:59:01,511 --> 01:59:06,511
You'll start to see better and you can
move through the gray area without being,

1791
01:59:08,350 --> 01:59:13,350
without being so decisive that in a gray
area you don't know if it's black or

1792
01:59:13,721 --> 01:59:17,680
white. Right? Right. So if you decide
as the leader, I'm going black,

1793
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:20,920
going black,
then when the gray area clears up,

1794
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:24,130
it was white that you should have
gone with. You don't need to do that.

1795
01:59:24,131 --> 01:59:27,340
In many cases you can say, okay, I'm a
lean a little bit towards the black cause.

1796
01:59:27,341 --> 01:59:28,174
That's what I'm feeling.

1797
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:30,550
And then all of a sudden
you started moving there and
you start seeing that, no,

1798
01:59:30,551 --> 01:59:34,120
this is going to be a white decision.
Yeah, okay, I can recover from that.

1799
01:59:34,121 --> 01:59:39,100
I can move backwards and and repair what
decision was made and the best way to

1800
01:59:39,101 --> 01:59:41,890
do that and say, hey guys,
here's the situation.

1801
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:44,800
I thought that black was going
to be the right decision.

1802
01:59:44,830 --> 01:59:46,960
I started leaning in that direction.
I was wrong.

1803
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:51,430
Now I see that white is the right
answer and we're going with white.

1804
01:59:52,150 --> 01:59:53,680
Does anyone have any questions about that?

1805
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:57,490
Does everyone understand why I did
that? Oh, you don't understand why?

1806
01:59:57,491 --> 01:59:59,290
Let me explain it to you. Here's
what I thought. Here's what I saw.

1807
01:59:59,291 --> 02:00:02,560
Did you next time,
do you want me to contact you so you can,

1808
02:00:02,710 --> 02:00:04,960
that's what I'm talking about. And
by the way, when I'm doing that,

1809
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:07,750
I'm building relationships with my team,
which is what I want to do.

1810
02:00:08,590 --> 02:00:12,400
I just was talking to a leader the
other day and I told him and reiterated

1811
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:13,720
something,
I've said it over and over again,

1812
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:18,250
but people that did things for me
and the teams that were in the army,

1813
02:00:18,251 --> 02:00:20,320
the Marine Corps in the
seal teams in my platoon,

1814
02:00:20,321 --> 02:00:21,790
up and down the chain of command,
doesn't matter.

1815
02:00:22,450 --> 02:00:27,450
99.9% of it wasn't because I had some
kind of rank or privileges over them.

1816
02:00:28,260 --> 02:00:30,580
And it was always because I had
a good relationship with people.

1817
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:32,890
And when you build that good
relationship with people,

1818
02:00:33,310 --> 02:00:37,570
that's what it's all about. Then they
do things for you and you know what?

1819
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:41,350
You do things for them too. It's not a
one way street that I'm talking about,

1820
02:00:41,351 --> 02:00:43,540
cause you won't build any relationships
if you're building a one way street.

1821
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:45,130
Right? No one's going to
be your friend after you.

1822
02:00:45,250 --> 02:00:47,140
Just take advantage of
them over and over again.

1823
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:51,940
Like those people that call you only
when they need something from you right

1824
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:52,631
now.

1825
02:00:52,631 --> 02:00:55,390
I actually don't have a problem with
that cause I don't communicate with a lot

1826
02:00:55,391 --> 02:00:56,270
of people. Right. I,

1827
02:00:56,710 --> 02:01:00,460
I communicate on social media with a
boat with a bunch of different people.

1828
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:01,190
He'll get you there.

1829
02:01:01,190 --> 02:01:05,860
But as far as like when one of my
buddies called me up and says, Hey,

1830
02:01:05,861 --> 02:01:09,880
I need this favor. I'm like, cool on it.
I haven't talked to him for nine months.

1831
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:13,210
He's only calling me because he needs
something from me. It doesn't matter.

1832
02:01:13,390 --> 02:01:15,550
And people do that with me
all the time and it's cool.

1833
02:01:15,640 --> 02:01:16,840
Now this isn't a big group of people.

1834
02:01:16,841 --> 02:01:21,100
It was like six people in the
world and those same six people,

1835
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:25,960
they don't call to wish me happy birthday.
Don't call and tell me, you know, uh,

1836
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:30,490
merry Christmas. They call me up and say,
Hey, I need this from you. Can you do it?

1837
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,420
And I'm like,
God,

1838
02:01:32,230 --> 02:01:37,010
no factor that you even have a birthday
negative. I haven't manufacturing date.

1839
02:01:39,850 --> 02:01:40,683
So funny like

1840
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:44,810
I'm just trying to imagine someone
calling you to wish you happy birthday.

1841
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:48,050
I mean maybe like your wife or was it
awkward when I got in the civilian sector

1842
02:01:48,051 --> 02:01:50,480
and people be like when's your birthday?
And I'd be like, why one? Yeah.

1843
02:01:50,481 --> 02:01:52,340
What do you,
what are you talking about?

1844
02:01:52,341 --> 02:01:54,900
Why are you trying to get my
personal information or attack you?

1845
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:02,510
He would sign or you know,
you know the uh,

1846
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:05,540
what was the other funny
thing about the birthday deal?

1847
02:02:05,710 --> 02:02:08,780
Well that's like getting presence.
I'm not good with presence. Yeah man.

1848
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:12,650
Like don't get me any presence cause
I don't want what you got me. Yeah.

1849
02:02:12,680 --> 02:02:15,430
If I want something I already
have it. Get it. Yeah.

1850
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:19,040
So what you got me isn't
going to be appreciated.

1851
02:02:19,190 --> 02:02:22,700
There's a one gift that my wife
got me one time and I haven't,

1852
02:02:22,701 --> 02:02:26,240
I've been thinking about why
haven't talked about this
particular hole situation

1853
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:29,400
and that's, there's a band
called the white stripes. Sure.

1854
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:33,260
Lights and the white stripes.
Jack White, meg white.

1855
02:02:33,290 --> 02:02:36,650
The white stripes are awesome.
They're awesome band.

1856
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:41,950
And there's so many layers with the white
stripes. Yes. First of all, there's,

1857
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:44,870
I'll tell you two layers that I love
about the white stripes. Number one,

1858
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:50,510
all their clothing, guitars, drums,

1859
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:51,201
keyboards,

1860
02:02:51,201 --> 02:02:54,770
everything that they have on stage and
everything that they have on their record

1861
02:02:54,771 --> 02:02:58,250
albums. Everything that they
have is either red, black,

1862
02:02:58,251 --> 02:03:03,110
or white on all the records. Since day
one, that's number one. Number two,

1863
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:08,770
they only have free sounds in any
of their songs at any one time.

1864
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:15,290
Hmm. So those three sounds
could be drums, vocals, guitar.

1865
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:19,940
They could be drums, keyboards,
vocals. They could be keyboards,

1866
02:03:19,941 --> 02:03:23,240
guitar, vocals. But they only
have three sounds at any one time.

1867
02:03:23,241 --> 02:03:25,300
Vocals is one of the things
is one of those tanks.

1868
02:03:26,100 --> 02:03:29,150
There's only two and there's only
two people in the band. Anyways,

1869
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:31,970
the white stripes is awesome band.

1870
02:03:32,090 --> 02:03:35,930
And my wife bought me tickets
to go see the white stripes.

1871
02:03:35,931 --> 02:03:37,370
Now I didn't even think about,

1872
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:41,780
I never pay attention to when bands are
playing and whatever. So I was, I was,

1873
02:03:42,740 --> 02:03:44,090
I don't use this term very often,

1874
02:03:44,091 --> 02:03:48,920
but I was overjoyed that she got
me tickets to the white stripes.

1875
02:03:49,010 --> 02:03:50,330
I was so stoked.

1876
02:03:50,780 --> 02:03:55,780
And then meg white had some issues and
they canceled the whole tour and they

1877
02:03:56,091 --> 02:03:56,924
never played again.

1878
02:03:57,020 --> 02:03:59,810
And we're like a little couple of weeks
away from being in San Diego where I was

1879
02:03:59,811 --> 02:04:00,830
going to go see the white stripes.

1880
02:04:00,980 --> 02:04:05,030
So the question is ultimately ultimately
the grand scheme of things and with

1881
02:04:05,031 --> 02:04:08,270
that a good gift to give Jocko.
That was an awesome gift to give me.

1882
02:04:08,271 --> 02:04:13,271
Still the it was it the thought that
counts in this case it was a beautiful got

1883
02:04:13,450 --> 02:04:16,330
me and I was and I couldn't
believe she thought of it. Yeah.

1884
02:04:16,580 --> 02:04:19,610
Cause normally it's like, oh you got me
a sweater from some store that I hate.

1885
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:22,740
No,

1886
02:04:22,740 --> 02:04:27,320
I'm really hard to shop for if I want
something I have it and I don't want that

1887
02:04:27,321 --> 02:04:29,330
much. So I was like, oh I want something.

1888
02:04:29,331 --> 02:04:34,331
I have it once every 18 months I
want something and then I get it.

1889
02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:37,870
Yeah. I'll get you like a new tee
shirt or something. You wear that?

1890
02:04:37,871 --> 02:04:41,220
Well this tee shirts, fine. Don't get
me a new one. This one works good.

1891
02:04:41,470 --> 02:04:44,810
Mm hmm.
So yeah.

1892
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:47,063
Yeah.
It seems like

1893
02:04:47,420 --> 02:04:52,190
we just went off on a tangent. I feel
like you went off on a tangent, you know.

1894
02:04:52,340 --> 02:04:52,771
You know why?

1895
02:04:52,771 --> 02:04:54,780
Cause I was listening to the white
stripes the other day and I was thinking,

1896
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:58,650
I never give the white stripes the
props that they deserve. And Jack White,

1897
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:01,970
the props that he deserves
as a singer songwriter.

1898
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:07,050
I don't think brother and sister, they're
not allegedly legend husband, wife.

1899
02:05:07,051 --> 02:05:09,480
They got divorced, but they always
claim to be brother, sister,

1900
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:13,020
my little sister meg white more later.
No, this is my big sister. That's right.

1901
02:05:13,120 --> 02:05:13,980
Yeah.
That's what he always said.

1902
02:05:14,390 --> 02:05:17,770
Dang. That's good man. Cool.

1903
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:22,090
Well the original point was
these crazy savage type people,

1904
02:05:22,780 --> 02:05:27,220
maybe normal people other
than their crazy job. Yeah.

1905
02:05:27,310 --> 02:05:30,130
And what's, and I'm, but I'm
not saying so. It's cool.

1906
02:05:31,180 --> 02:05:34,690
And this is you're, you're, you're
accountable for your actions. Yeah.

1907
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:35,870
Regardless of how cool you are.

1908
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:41,680
And that's something from any leadership
position you need to be aware of.

1909
02:05:42,210 --> 02:05:43,610
And when I say new leadership position,

1910
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:46,400
I mean you as a frontline trooper because
if you as a frontline troopers getting

1911
02:05:46,401 --> 02:05:49,880
told to do something that you know is
morally, ethically or legally wrong,

1912
02:05:49,881 --> 02:05:50,661
and you still do it,

1913
02:05:50,661 --> 02:05:53,780
it's on you sure you can point the finger
and blame the higher ups in the higher

1914
02:05:53,781 --> 02:05:56,210
ups would be burned to if they told
you to do something that was wrong,

1915
02:05:56,600 --> 02:06:00,110
but you need to be accountable for what
you did and that's all there is to it.

1916
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:04,010
Yeah. Okay. It's a rough tour.
No one wants to play that game.

1917
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:07,940
The Nazis wanted to play that game off,
not mine. Hey, I was ordered to do this.

1918
02:06:08,230 --> 02:06:11,810
You can't do that. Can't say that. Don't
get that excuse. You don't get the,

1919
02:06:11,811 --> 02:06:15,530
I was a good person and I took care of
my kids even though I was shoving people

1920
02:06:15,531 --> 02:06:18,110
into, into a gas chamber. You
don't get to play that game.

1921
02:06:18,280 --> 02:06:20,830
No. Yeah man, it's too much.

1922
02:06:21,250 --> 02:06:24,080
But there's a small little
documentary on the line. I don't know.

1923
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:24,881
I didn't watch the whole thing,

1924
02:06:24,881 --> 02:06:28,660
but it was about the executioner in the
Middle East somewhere in one of these

1925
02:06:28,661 --> 02:06:33,190
countries where you know, he has his
sword and it's his job, you know,

1926
02:06:33,570 --> 02:06:37,060
and he's a straight up executioner.
Yeah. That's it. That's just his job.

1927
02:06:37,061 --> 02:06:39,570
Modern Day job. And he's
like, yeah, yeah, it was,

1928
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:43,690
it wasn't an old school you don't see
on Youtube. Yeah. Like last week. Yeah.

1929
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:46,860
But it's like, it's funny cause
the whole feel of the document,

1930
02:06:46,861 --> 02:06:49,420
she was just real like, oh
yeah, this guy has a cool job.

1931
02:06:49,660 --> 02:06:53,680
And he's like slicing people's heads off
with great precision and he's so good

1932
02:06:53,681 --> 02:06:57,580
at his job, you know, lit here's his
family and they're loving, you know,

1933
02:06:57,581 --> 02:06:59,380
and they're, you know,
he's playing with his kids.

1934
02:06:59,381 --> 02:07:01,330
It's like all this stuff's just weird man.

1935
02:07:04,140 --> 02:07:08,170
Anyway, there's those another culture.

1936
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:13,690
It's weird. A lot of gray areas
and Allen to my man indeed.

1937
02:07:14,590 --> 02:07:16,600
Kind of anyway or not.

1938
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:21,680
I feel like we should go into the support.
Yeah,

1939
02:07:22,150 --> 02:07:26,350
we should go into the sun.
Porch support is one of those good things.

1940
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:30,520
Very dynamic. Supporting
others, supporting yourself,

1941
02:07:31,510 --> 02:07:36,280
supporting others and yourself, which is
a separate category. Support my opinion.

1942
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:40,000
So there's yourself, others and yourself
and others. That's another category.

1943
02:07:41,770 --> 02:07:44,260
Want to talk about on it.
We're talking about all three categories.

1944
02:07:44,320 --> 02:07:47,800
Support Yourself.
But when a supplementation,

1945
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:51,280
and we talk about supplementation
all the time, but you know,

1946
02:07:51,281 --> 02:07:53,740
you talk about supplementation will,

1947
02:07:53,830 --> 02:07:55,390
you're the one who turned
it turned me onto it.

1948
02:07:55,600 --> 02:08:00,600
So actually some of it I took shroom
tech before you talked to before.

1949
02:08:02,021 --> 02:08:05,570
Pre podcast pretty podcast
sells on shroom tech. Um,

1950
02:08:05,650 --> 02:08:07,540
I was on Alpha brain shroom tech.

1951
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:15,090
I got my shipment of
Alpha brain pills back in.

1952
02:08:15,101 --> 02:08:18,850
I had run out then I only had the instant.
And so now like I said,

1953
02:08:18,851 --> 02:08:22,710
what's Nice about the pilsner is
you got something come to good.

1954
02:08:22,711 --> 02:08:23,960
Come and do the podcast.
Yes.

1955
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:28,440
What Alpha brain pills and I might double
up on the Alpha brain if I think I got

1956
02:08:28,450 --> 02:08:33,390
to really get my get engaged. But
it's good to have the, the capsules.

1957
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:38,890
Yes. Well, I dig it. But what's cool about
the drink is it tastes good at, and I,

1958
02:08:39,180 --> 02:08:43,150
if you get the sweet tooth itch going
and you want something sweet and you get

1959
02:08:43,151 --> 02:08:45,040
the peach. Yeah, the natural peach,

1960
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:48,730
not the spicy spicy has a
different situation going on.

1961
02:08:48,820 --> 02:08:52,780
So the peaches just straight up like
tasty, like peach. Yeah, peach juice,

1962
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:57,820
peach juice kind of situation. Yeah, kind
of like that. Agree. I dig it. The pills,

1963
02:08:57,821 --> 02:09:01,270
I dig it. And that's actually
what we had with the pills.

1964
02:09:03,290 --> 02:09:06,390
I said a week because me and my brother,
we were awful brain.

1965
02:09:06,730 --> 02:09:09,700
But when they came out with an incident
that was better and it starts to become

1966
02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:12,760
like this little kind of ritual, you know,
eat makes up your Alpha brain, you know,

1967
02:09:12,761 --> 02:09:15,130
kind of thing. And it's
instant. I don't know,

1968
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:19,450
just seems like either way it doesn't
matter if I haven't mentioned it already.

1969
02:09:19,451 --> 02:09:21,910
I think I did.
These are supplements from on it

1970
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:27,420
on a.com there'll be, we talked about the
supplements, but there's like workouts.

1971
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:30,550
I just bought a jump
rope. Did you? Yeah. See.

1972
02:09:30,551 --> 02:09:35,320
So when I was young I was good at Java.
Going to be being a Joe jump rope too.

1973
02:09:35,410 --> 02:09:39,870
Yeah. And then as a, you know,
as I think kind of when, when,

1974
02:09:40,450 --> 02:09:44,020
I dunno, maybe early twenties kind of
stopped. So that's a long time ago.

1975
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:47,590
Jump Rope is awesome. Yeah. So as,
and you know, you know how like,

1976
02:09:47,591 --> 02:09:51,850
like riding a bike, he couldn't stay good
at something a little bit. You're rusty,

1977
02:09:51,880 --> 02:09:53,650
you're rusty. Yeah,
definitely. Gonna be rusty.

1978
02:09:53,680 --> 02:09:56,380
You can't shred and you can go as long,
you know, like that kind of stuff.

1979
02:09:56,560 --> 02:09:58,680
It's weird cause it, you know how
to jump rope. Yeah. You know what,

1980
02:09:58,690 --> 02:10:03,220
you were just back in the day of boxing,
boxing, jumping rope for three minutes.

1981
02:10:03,221 --> 02:10:06,340
It was like no factor. Yeah. Go
junk blurb. Five, 10 minute warm up.

1982
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:10,990
Go get your jump right out, get out, get
out, get out three minutes on the rounds.

1983
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:14,570
We feel it. Yeah. So yeah, I
bought one of those and it's,

1984
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:19,600
so the interesting thing about that is
jump rope technology has changed a little

1985
02:10:20,651 --> 02:10:24,660
bit. So what is it made of?
Steel? No. Well there's, I'm
sure the steel in there so,

1986
02:10:24,661 --> 02:10:28,180
but it's like each handle has a swivel,
the little simple,

1987
02:10:28,181 --> 02:10:30,310
but this is like way
more to it than before.

1988
02:10:30,310 --> 02:10:34,020
Last time it was like two wooden handles
and our rope for sure. Actual real.

1989
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:38,630
This one is like a cord that survives
all of this stuff. I don't know. Anyway,

1990
02:10:38,920 --> 02:10:43,850
I've got to jump rope. Jump Rope is on
there if you want. Well the jump off.

1991
02:10:43,870 --> 02:10:47,900
Yeah, I was pretty good too. Hey,

1992
02:10:47,901 --> 02:10:50,900
remember when like when you
jump rope and then when the,

1993
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:55,070
you know how like this was like elementary
school and if you'd get tired or you

1994
02:10:55,071 --> 02:10:58,860
couldn't keep her rhythm, they'd say,
Hey, just just wave it from birth.

1995
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:02,720
You know what I mean? Yeah. Uh,

1996
02:11:02,750 --> 02:11:07,640
what's it called when you turn it to
Tara? Tara, when you boom, like I'd like a

1997
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:10,940
matador,

1998
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:14,300
isn't it called matador when you just
go side to side because you can't get it

1999
02:11:14,301 --> 02:11:17,150
or whatever. Yeah. I just get that rhythm
going. Oh yeah. I don't know the name.

2000
02:11:17,150 --> 02:11:20,330
I never had to do that cause I was
expert level even in elementary school.

2001
02:11:20,331 --> 02:11:21,920
But that's Mac.
That's going to be you.

2002
02:11:21,921 --> 02:11:25,670
If in fact you want to step up
so you can get that on on it.

2003
02:11:25,700 --> 02:11:29,950
Not just if you want kettle bells
on there too. The good kind.

2004
02:11:30,650 --> 02:11:32,630
Well, kettlebells are good. Straight up.

2005
02:11:32,631 --> 02:11:37,631
They're all good and but on it has those
artistic ones because even those add

2006
02:11:38,481 --> 02:11:40,880
another layer,
but they have the regular one,

2007
02:11:40,881 --> 02:11:44,660
I think they're called the competition
ones. Don't quote him. Yeah. Oh yeah.

2008
02:11:44,661 --> 02:11:48,710
So yeah, you get the legend bells,
which is like what? The cyclops,

2009
02:11:48,850 --> 02:11:53,510
the Werewolf, I look at them,
they're, they're dope primal bells,

2010
02:11:53,511 --> 02:11:56,690
which is like all the primates and stuff.

2011
02:11:57,230 --> 02:12:02,230
I think I got the chimp to
chimps in two werewolves.

2012
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:06,590
See I have, I have Zombie bells.
Mine are just evil zombies.

2013
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:10,630
How big is the one? You know? I forgot.
I got to look. Yeah, that's like,

2014
02:12:10,631 --> 02:12:13,680
it's like designer Yuki
probably keep it inside too.

2015
02:12:14,650 --> 02:12:16,100
You really do know.

2016
02:12:16,101 --> 02:12:21,101
The one that I keep inside is not the
ones in my garage or for the long heavy

2017
02:12:21,450 --> 02:12:25,190
work. This one is for, oh, I'm
tired of writing right now.

2018
02:12:25,310 --> 02:12:28,490
I'm going to bang out some
snatches. Right, right. Boom, boom.

2019
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:33,200
God feel a lot better now.
Right. More harder. There you go.

2020
02:12:33,950 --> 02:12:35,690
But yeah, this is anyway,
the point there is,

2021
02:12:35,691 --> 02:12:38,840
there's very cool things on the website,

2022
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:42,730
on it.com and the supplements,
it's not to mention this,

2023
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,960
the fact is the supplements
are straight up,

2024
02:12:44,961 --> 02:12:49,610
the best ones straight up because
from the beginning and how has this,

2025
02:12:50,810 --> 02:12:54,230
and I dunno if we already mentioned this,
but I hear it.

2026
02:12:54,470 --> 02:12:58,920
Joe Rogan talks about all
the time how namedrop Yep.

2027
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:03,940
I listen to Joe Rogan all the time and
he says these things and I believe him.

2028
02:13:04,190 --> 02:13:09,140
Um, if you get like, I dunno, shrink tech
and you're like, hey, I didn't feel it.

2029
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:12,050
I got tapped out. So you know, I
expect more out of stream tech.

2030
02:13:12,051 --> 02:13:16,840
I expect this to make me
tap out everybody. I don't
like it. Send it back. No,

2031
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,060
you don't even send it back. You
send them an email saying, hey,

2032
02:13:20,061 --> 02:13:21,680
I don't like this stuff.
They'll just send your money back.

2033
02:13:21,681 --> 02:13:24,860
You don't even have to send it back.
That's pretty awesome then. Yup.

2034
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:26,450
But don't be trying to be like,

2035
02:13:26,610 --> 02:13:30,230
I'm going to give me my money back and
the next month after you're done with it,

2036
02:13:30,231 --> 02:13:33,690
order some more and then do it again.
Yeah,

2037
02:13:33,720 --> 02:13:38,340
you're going to get
ostracized nonetheless. Um,
Krill oil, that's the one.

2038
02:13:38,341 --> 02:13:41,430
You don't want to not have krill oil.
Even if you're like a young guy,

2039
02:13:41,490 --> 02:13:42,900
in my opinion,
we should,

2040
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:46,380
I should always been on Krill oil
and if you're not in Krill oil,

2041
02:13:46,381 --> 02:13:48,810
I think you are like a
step behind joint wise,

2042
02:13:50,460 --> 02:13:53,370
which puts you behind it around a few
different ways. A lot of different ways.

2043
02:13:53,371 --> 02:13:56,070
Yeah. You get an hour working out as
hard. And I was working on this hard, uh,

2044
02:13:56,071 --> 02:14:00,690
struggling through various activities
in everyday life. I told the story,

2045
02:14:00,691 --> 02:14:02,220
whatever, but I do it
all the time. You know,

2046
02:14:02,221 --> 02:14:05,370
when you fill up water in the
big five gallon jugs, you know,

2047
02:14:05,790 --> 02:14:08,610
and Brett do that at night when
it's kind of cold. It's like bright.

2048
02:14:08,611 --> 02:14:11,070
You can carry those things
from the thing to your car.

2049
02:14:11,340 --> 02:14:14,790
You don't want to be worried
about my knees or whatever.

2050
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:19,800
You're back on the trials and
he's got to put it in there, Bro.

2051
02:14:20,070 --> 02:14:23,550
You think I'm going to write your own
book, Dude. What about like the truck?

2052
02:14:23,570 --> 02:14:28,440
That kind of crazy trials you've been
through caring warm on a cool night in

2053
02:14:28,441 --> 02:14:32,640
southern California.
Very fresh.

2054
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:36,620
Pure water by the way,
doesn't make it any lighter though.

2055
02:14:36,630 --> 02:14:40,720
You still have to struggle, right?
Here's the thing. No, there are micro,

2056
02:14:40,740 --> 02:14:41,430
they're critical.

2057
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:45,390
They're called micro struggles is
really what they are standing in line.

2058
02:14:45,720 --> 02:14:47,460
Actually the sending in line thing,
that's not a struggle.

2059
02:14:47,461 --> 02:14:48,710
That's manufactured struggle,

2060
02:14:48,711 --> 02:14:52,890
so it's like an exercise in discipline
and embracing struggle. That's what it is.

2061
02:14:52,891 --> 02:14:57,420
It's not an actual struggle bestowed
upon your heaped on your shoulders.

2062
02:14:57,600 --> 02:14:59,790
You know that you have
to bear in everyday life.

2063
02:14:59,791 --> 02:15:01,180
That's not what's the standing in line.

2064
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:04,460
That's why you need your little
book about echoes struggles. Right,

2065
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:09,500
and you can document these various me
looking for a specific wine wine section.

2066
02:15:13,240 --> 02:15:18,060
We've got a tomato sauce
struggle.

2067
02:15:18,320 --> 02:15:21,680
The wives struggle the groceries. Now
we've got to fill in the water bottles.

2068
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:22,530
There's four chapters.

2069
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:26,280
Micro struggle and filling up the water
is not a struggle because I'm on the

2070
02:15:26,281 --> 02:15:31,140
Krill oil. Oh Omega threes fright into
my joint straight into my joints. Uptake,

2071
02:15:31,440 --> 02:15:36,090
high percentage uptake.
Anyway, get on the Krill oil.

2072
02:15:36,270 --> 02:15:38,550
I'm on the strong bone now too by the way

2073
02:15:40,110 --> 02:15:43,440
for that's for tendons.
The tendon attaching to the bone.

2074
02:15:45,060 --> 02:15:49,230
Strontium does need about it does it?
I feel really good about it actually.

2075
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:54,500
More PR preventative cause like cause
I lift nonetheless strontium that's in

2076
02:15:55,891 --> 02:15:57,660
strong bone that get doesn't,

2077
02:15:57,780 --> 02:16:00,420
that doesn't hit the like the
limelight isn't on that all the time.

2078
02:16:00,421 --> 02:16:03,210
It's all on calcium. Most of the time
like calcium makes your bones strong.

2079
02:16:03,211 --> 02:16:07,740
Strontium just as much.
So we get on this trombone,

2080
02:16:08,970 --> 02:16:13,290
a bone strength also off of brain.

2081
02:16:13,291 --> 02:16:16,620
Obviously shroom tech for high,
high performance. Go on the website.

2082
02:16:16,650 --> 02:16:17,820
Whatever you need.
They got it.

2083
02:16:17,821 --> 02:16:22,821
They even got like try blend
peanut butter nut butter.

2084
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:27,690
It's not peanut butter. It's like all
almond cashew and walnut. Don't know.

2085
02:16:27,950 --> 02:16:31,170
Anyway,
it's delish get on now anyway.

2086
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:36,320
[inaudible] dot com slash Jocko if
you want 10% off pay full price,

2087
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:40,780
that's all that's up to you. Really.
You know what I'm saying? Hmm.

2088
02:16:41,230 --> 02:16:44,770
I wouldn't recommend it. I don't even
know of anyone who would recommend that.

2089
02:16:45,960 --> 02:16:46,740
Awesome.

2090
02:16:46,740 --> 02:16:51,740
Also good way to support if
you're interested in the book,

2091
02:16:53,680 --> 02:16:57,580
man's search for meaning Viktor Frankl.

2092
02:17:00,940 --> 02:17:05,940
What I've done is I put on the
website a page with all of the books,

2093
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:09,520
all of them that Jocko is covered.

2094
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:14,470
Every once in a while Jack will
cover an article that the links,

2095
02:17:14,480 --> 02:17:18,130
maybe I'll do that, but nonetheless the
books are all on their all in order to,

2096
02:17:18,131 --> 02:17:20,200
by the way, so the most recent
is going to be at the top.

2097
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:25,240
This one will be on there. It is on there.
Do you want to support? Click on there.

2098
02:17:25,241 --> 02:17:28,800
If you're going to get the book,
Click through their directs,

2099
02:17:28,820 --> 02:17:32,500
you straight to Amazon. What if
you're doing other shopping? Amen.

2100
02:17:32,530 --> 02:17:34,570
Go ahead and do the same thing.
Click on it.

2101
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:38,320
We have a banner on the front page too
and then you can click on there. Yeah,

2102
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:41,500
and then you can do shopping. Yeah. If
you want. That sounds like a good plan.

2103
02:17:41,590 --> 02:17:45,460
Even if you're buying duct tape
also,

2104
02:17:45,850 --> 02:17:50,320
do you have a link to your favorite
duck tape on there? Dang. I don't know.

2105
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:54,340
Sometimes I say things that are just so
inherently brilliant. It makes me wonder.

2106
02:17:54,610 --> 02:17:59,590
So we will have a duct tape
link link for sure. Yeah.

2107
02:17:59,591 --> 02:18:04,480
Just in case everyone needs duct tape
and they especially need it when they get

2108
02:18:04,481 --> 02:18:04,601
done,

2109
02:18:04,601 --> 02:18:07,180
listen to the podcast or they're thinking
about the things that they're going to

2110
02:18:07,181 --> 02:18:10,270
be duct taping together
yet. So yeah, that's true.

2111
02:18:10,271 --> 02:18:12,920
You know why I mentioned duct
tape in the beginning and I,

2112
02:18:13,030 --> 02:18:16,720
I didn't really realize it because they
didn't think about it until a handful of

2113
02:18:16,721 --> 02:18:20,920
people asked me, you know, why? Why? Cause
I used to watch macgyver all the time.

2114
02:18:21,010 --> 02:18:25,330
Actually I still watch
macgyver. No, no, no.

2115
02:18:25,331 --> 02:18:30,331
It's on a channel called clue
c l o random random channel.

2116
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:35,240
It's like a retro channel
kind of. Okay. For a man.

2117
02:18:36,080 --> 02:18:39,060
Well, there's a new macgyver, by
the way. A new one. It was, it lame.

2118
02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:41,740
I don't think it's as good as the old one,
but it could be just my,

2119
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:46,330
you know how you get attached to your
old shows. It could be that, but look,

2120
02:18:46,410 --> 02:18:49,660
everyone was dope back in the day so you
know, whichever, and that was his thing.

2121
02:18:49,661 --> 02:18:52,330
Duct tape people. People
like to say, Ooh, paper clip.

2122
02:18:52,331 --> 02:18:55,630
Right macgyver with the paper. He,
I, he never really had a paperclip.

2123
02:18:56,140 --> 02:19:00,160
He had duct tape. That was his thing
and Swiss army knife TV I play.

2124
02:19:00,161 --> 02:19:02,810
That's on you and I, I dig
it, but I was busy getting,

2125
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:07,390
after he had the Swiss army knife and
the duct tape, that was his thing.

2126
02:19:07,480 --> 02:19:09,970
Everything else he just founded
in its environment is environment,

2127
02:19:09,971 --> 02:19:13,210
which which changed from
episode to episode. Nonetheless,

2128
02:19:13,450 --> 02:19:16,570
subscribed to the podcast on
iTunes, stitcher, Google play,

2129
02:19:16,571 --> 02:19:21,430
all these platforms that provide a
podcast. We're on all of them. Boom.

2130
02:19:21,431 --> 02:19:25,990
Subscribe, which are when you use, even
if you use too, I guess, right? That'd be,

2131
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:29,150
do people use to platform?
Why did I do that?

2132
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:33,500
There's some reason I had to
go to a different platform,

2133
02:19:34,550 --> 02:19:38,240
so I have a backup platform. Boom.
Subscribed to boat. Yeah, right.

2134
02:19:38,300 --> 02:19:41,510
Is that kind of like Youtube and Vimeo?
You know,

2135
02:19:41,570 --> 02:19:45,500
some guys will have a Vimeo account as
well. I don't know why that got escalated.

2136
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:50,720
You too bad. I'll tell you
what. Well, I don't know why,

2137
02:19:50,721 --> 02:19:53,210
but this could be the reason
why cause youtube kids.

2138
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:57,200
Vimeo is kind of for for like professional
people who fancy themselves as like

2139
02:19:57,201 --> 02:19:58,550
film makers.

2140
02:19:58,550 --> 02:20:03,550
Like here's my piece that I've made in
her artists tends to be that youtube is

2141
02:20:03,621 --> 02:20:07,670
just like guys, Utah kind of that
too. But overall. Yeah, exactly right.

2142
02:20:07,671 --> 02:20:11,390
Just throw my video to youtube,
like you know the tube TV to you,

2143
02:20:11,720 --> 02:20:16,040
whatever you are. Vimeo is, I don't know
the name. I guess I could think about it,

2144
02:20:16,041 --> 02:20:19,550
but nonetheless, that's what it
shook itself out to beaten, you know?

2145
02:20:19,940 --> 02:20:24,100
So it's funny when people were like,
I'm not on Youtube, I'm on Vimeo.

2146
02:20:25,630 --> 02:20:26,300
Do you,

2147
02:20:26,300 --> 02:20:30,000
do you have to do anything to be on Vimeo
or you're just still the same thing?

2148
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:32,210
Same exact thing.
It's exactly like youtube,

2149
02:20:32,211 --> 02:20:34,780
except for the fact which
now that I'm thinking about,

2150
02:20:34,781 --> 02:20:38,570
it makes sense where if you upload
a video and you're like, oh man,

2151
02:20:38,571 --> 02:20:41,540
in one of these titles, midway
through the video, I spelt it wrong,

2152
02:20:41,930 --> 02:20:42,650
which happens to me.

2153
02:20:42,650 --> 02:20:47,060
Sometimes you can go back into your
account and to replace the video.

2154
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:50,810
Even if it's been up for a week, you can
just replay or youtube, Vimeo, youtube,

2155
02:20:50,811 --> 02:20:53,420
you cannot, yes, a new video. Yeah.

2156
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,190
It's like you got to upload
again and here's the thing.

2157
02:20:55,191 --> 02:20:59,910
You can't upload the same file. Got to
rename as youtube. No, you've got to read.

2158
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:03,380
It'll, it has all these little little
information in the file. There'll be like,

2159
02:21:03,381 --> 02:21:05,570
hey, that's a duplicate file.
You can't do that. You know?

2160
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:10,010
Probably had something to do with the
advertising. I Dunno. Nonetheless,

2161
02:21:10,250 --> 02:21:13,460
subscribe to Jocko podcasts on Youtube.

2162
02:21:14,450 --> 02:21:18,890
If you like that channel. We're trying
to provide what you call providing value.

2163
02:21:19,070 --> 02:21:22,490
You know, that's, don't own.
Say that uncle, that's another,

2164
02:21:23,180 --> 02:21:26,200
it sounded cool when I first heard it,
but that's another,

2165
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:31,730
that's another one of those things
where it sounded cool and then everyone

2166
02:21:32,090 --> 02:21:35,330
thought like me or I think
like everyone else, whatever.

2167
02:21:35,331 --> 02:21:37,490
And so everyone started using it.

2168
02:21:37,491 --> 02:21:39,650
Now it's like people are
abusing it and move here.

2169
02:21:39,651 --> 02:21:42,490
Just trying to provide value and it just,
you know,

2170
02:21:42,491 --> 02:21:45,010
it starts to sound voice you just
threw out there and there's only,

2171
02:21:45,011 --> 02:21:46,660
I don't do voices other than escalation

2172
02:21:49,280 --> 02:21:52,700
thinks Jocko. Anyway,
so subscribe to Youtube.

2173
02:21:52,790 --> 02:21:56,960
We're trying to provide some value there
with the excerpts and various other

2174
02:21:58,220 --> 02:22:00,890
clips aside from the video
version of this podcast.

2175
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:04,490
Your Memorial Day one was really good man.

2176
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:07,820
I liked it and it was a
powerful, powerful letter. Yeah.

2177
02:22:12,300 --> 02:22:14,350
Bunch of other stuff.
I'm like,

2178
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:20,490
Jocko has the store,
it's called Jocko store.

2179
02:22:21,390 --> 02:22:24,870
If you didn't already know Jacqueline,
store.com. What do we have on Draka store?

2180
02:22:25,080 --> 02:22:26,310
We have t shirts.

2181
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:31,470
If [inaudible] also has a podcast
called Jocko Jocko white tea.

2182
02:22:31,560 --> 02:22:34,290
It's called Jocko white tea.
I think I see a trend here.

2183
02:22:35,310 --> 02:22:39,000
The trend is real for
sure. Um, nonetheless,

2184
02:22:39,001 --> 02:22:42,820
the shirts of originality
in name will know me things.

2185
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:46,950
So in a way,
because here there are layers in that too,

2186
02:22:46,951 --> 02:22:49,920
and there is sophistication to that.
Even though it seems simple. Oh,

2187
02:22:50,010 --> 02:22:53,670
because there I was being sophisticated.
You aren't being somebody out.

2188
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:57,810
There's more to than just [inaudible].
There just happens to be my name.

2189
02:22:57,811 --> 02:23:02,580
There's two, there's more to that goes
beyond this podcast beyond the TV. Okay.

2190
02:23:02,581 --> 02:23:06,360
So just, let's just start with that
fact, which is complex in and of itself.

2191
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:07,740
Then you're like,
okay,

2192
02:23:08,850 --> 02:23:13,500
this is what roughly considered
a company technically,

2193
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:17,460
maybe. I guess if you had to,
if you had to ask me today,

2194
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:22,470
what do I do for a living?
And I was like, I was like,

2195
02:23:22,471 --> 02:23:26,580
oh, just like stuff. And he goes,
well what would you, how would you,

2196
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:29,880
what did he say? He said,
well how would you describe

2197
02:23:31,590 --> 02:23:35,430
what you do? And I said, stay busy.

2198
02:23:35,460 --> 02:23:38,220
That's what I do is okay, fair
enough. Yeah, there you go.

2199
02:23:38,670 --> 02:23:43,670
But technically cause Baras Dang,

2200
02:23:44,461 --> 02:23:45,820
I haven't heard that one in a all cool.

2201
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:52,110
Jocko podcast.com. That's an entity,
we'll call it an entity. I Dunno,

2202
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:53,280
company business.

2203
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:58,290
It's a place where we have the web
snuff nonetheless. Oh, you know what?

2204
02:23:58,291 --> 02:24:03,000
I'm going to go ahead and out on a
limb and call it a brand, brand, dish,

2205
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:07,290
whatever. Nonetheless, if you
call. Okay, well Jocko store,

2206
02:24:07,291 --> 02:24:10,710
that's the name of the store. Well,
that's true. And to be honest with you,

2207
02:24:10,800 --> 02:24:15,360
the reason that I called the podcast
Jocko podcasts when I was on Tim Ferriss's

2208
02:24:15,361 --> 02:24:19,680
podcast, I said, Jocko hungry. And I don't
even know. I don't know if I'd just said,

2209
02:24:19,681 --> 02:24:22,290
I don't know if it's all in
the podcast or not, but he,

2210
02:24:22,291 --> 02:24:24,150
I think he said something like, Oh, you
know, we've got to go get some food.

2211
02:24:24,151 --> 02:24:26,250
And I was like, Jocko hungry.
And then I was like, well,

2212
02:24:26,251 --> 02:24:30,540
we're going to do a podcast record Jocko
podcasts. That was the initial fought.

2213
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:33,450
There's the layer. Makes Sense. Yeah.

2214
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:37,620
And that's even with
naming the other worries,

2215
02:24:37,621 --> 02:24:42,540
I wanted to be able to do whatever
I wanted to do and not care. Yeah,

2216
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:43,351
and that makes sense.

2217
02:24:43,351 --> 02:24:46,770
I knew we're going to talk about Jujitsu
and fighting and music and an hardcore

2218
02:24:46,771 --> 02:24:48,300
and war and death.

2219
02:24:48,301 --> 02:24:52,080
And I just wanted to not
have any limitations.

2220
02:24:52,530 --> 02:24:56,130
And the only way I could do that, because
if you can give the podcast a name,

2221
02:24:56,131 --> 02:24:56,964
like you know,

2222
02:24:58,020 --> 02:25:01,980
the ultimate of this podcast,
you know, it's like, okay,

2223
02:25:01,981 --> 02:25:06,270
well then next thing you
know we're talking about war
and or if you call it the

2224
02:25:06,271 --> 02:25:07,081
war podcast,

2225
02:25:07,081 --> 02:25:10,260
but you're talking about business or if
you talk and talk about the leadership

2226
02:25:10,261 --> 02:25:11,910
podcast,
but you're talking about Jujitsu.

2227
02:25:12,450 --> 02:25:15,560
So how do you get all those things into
one thing called the Jocko podcast and I

2228
02:25:15,561 --> 02:25:18,870
can do whatever I want. Yeah, there you
go. And if people are looking for you,

2229
02:25:18,871 --> 02:25:22,550
they see you talk about x, Y,Z , and
they're like, I sure I can look on that.

2230
02:25:23,340 --> 02:25:24,190
Easy connection.

2231
02:25:24,190 --> 02:25:28,090
Yeah. And it's simple, which is like, you
know, simplicity goes a long way. Yeah.

2232
02:25:28,091 --> 02:25:30,730
You know, and that's kind of like a
thing. So why are we talking about this?

2233
02:25:30,731 --> 02:25:33,250
I'm just saying that's why it's called
Jacques Cousteau. Yeah, that's right.

2234
02:25:33,490 --> 02:25:34,870
So because it is a store,

2235
02:25:34,871 --> 02:25:38,150
people want to do other things in their
life besides listen to our own guys.

2236
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:41,460
Well you're the one chime in him and
I'm over here trying to talk about the

2237
02:25:41,670 --> 02:25:42,101
north side.

2238
02:25:42,101 --> 02:25:46,180
The other day when we had Roger Hayden
on and I gave you the silent treatment

2239
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:50,140
and, and when you looked at me for
affirmation while you were given the

2240
02:25:50,141 --> 02:25:54,220
advertising's, I didn't even nod.
I just looked at you and you got,

2241
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:58,450
you actually got uncomfortable.
You actually got uncomfortable.
You were like Amy,

2242
02:25:58,490 --> 02:25:58,920
you,

2243
02:25:58,920 --> 02:26:02,080
you look on your face like where you'd
look at me like I was going to give you a

2244
02:26:02,081 --> 02:26:06,640
smile. I know. I'd just look at you like
hurry up and then you got uncomfortable.

2245
02:26:06,730 --> 02:26:10,540
And I said, well he's, he's starting
to feel it. You gave me no mercy. Yeah.

2246
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:14,530
That's like subtle. Sure. Nah
Man, it's all good. You know?

2247
02:26:14,531 --> 02:26:16,720
So do that again right now.
You know,

2248
02:26:17,110 --> 02:26:21,520
so I can talk about this store Jocko store
Jocko, store.com if you like t shirts.

2249
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,010
No, I'm not saying if you
like tee shirts in general,

2250
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:28,600
I'm just saying if you want to represent
discipline equals freedom. What?

2251
02:26:28,810 --> 02:26:33,080
Get after it. No, the darkness. No,

2252
02:26:33,081 --> 02:26:38,030
that darkness. That's a
good one. Anyway, go on.

2253
02:26:38,031 --> 02:26:42,260
List or jumpstart a column. You can
see shirts if you like him. Go ahead.

2254
02:26:42,261 --> 02:26:44,750
Get one support that way. That's a good
one. I've got some rash guards on there.

2255
02:26:44,810 --> 02:26:49,730
One new rash guard out already says get
after it on it. Discipline on one sleeve.

2256
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:54,200
Freedom on the other sleeve.
Jocko approved. Really good. Um,

2257
02:26:54,500 --> 02:26:55,430
I think it's good.

2258
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:59,540
I feel that the people
who have witnessed it

2259
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:04,680
is that pump has to say witnessed it.
Like there's some kind of a little bit

2260
02:27:06,990 --> 02:27:11,990
anyone that's witnessed my rash guard
said I bestowed upon them by way of visual

2261
02:27:14,100 --> 02:27:16,710
people that call. How about people that
saw it? Thought it was a pretty cool,

2262
02:27:16,990 --> 02:27:20,400
it was cool. They thought was realistic.
They thought it was cool. And um,

2263
02:27:20,460 --> 02:27:23,730
so there it is. You go in the story,
you look at it. If you think it's cool,

2264
02:27:23,870 --> 02:27:28,200
you want to get to witness the glory
of Echo. Charles is rash guards.

2265
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:33,120
You may go to Jocko,
store.com and revel in the glory.

2266
02:27:35,490 --> 02:27:39,280
Exactly right and whatever else you
want this some good stuff on there.

2267
02:27:39,450 --> 02:27:42,070
We added this little thing too.
If we're out and I'm trying to be like,

2268
02:27:42,090 --> 02:27:44,940
I'm trying to restock, restock, boom.

2269
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:50,120
But I added this little thing where if
like let's say size medium or whatever is

2270
02:27:50,730 --> 02:27:54,540
out, it just says, oh little button,
notify me book, put your email,

2271
02:27:54,541 --> 02:27:57,330
boom notifies you when it's back in stock.
And again,

2272
02:27:57,331 --> 02:28:01,050
I'm trying to put them back in, stock
it asap. Boom, boom, boom right now.

2273
02:28:01,260 --> 02:28:05,720
But you know, give me a day or two
or whatever. We'll notify you. Boom.

2274
02:28:06,980 --> 02:28:11,370
Also psychological warfare,
if you didn't know what that is,

2275
02:28:11,730 --> 02:28:16,320
it's an album which tracks cop.
I'm not music tracks,

2276
02:28:18,510 --> 02:28:22,490
word track scent, like
spoken word, you know.

2277
02:28:22,580 --> 02:28:25,610
So basically what it's for is,
you know, it's not like poetry,

2278
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:30,590
well arguably not poetry but stuck
on there talking, talking to eat us.

2279
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:31,513
To me,

2280
02:28:31,880 --> 02:28:36,110
Jack was talking to me that I actually
quite literally was talking to you when

2281
02:28:36,111 --> 02:28:39,450
that was made. Exactly right. So you
know you can help and talk to you. Well,

2282
02:28:39,451 --> 02:28:43,310
so basically what it's for is he's
not just talking like everyday stuff,

2283
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:47,060
so when you have hard time waking up
in the morning or you have a hard time

2284
02:28:47,061 --> 02:28:50,240
because you're tired and you want to
skip the workout or you have a hard time

2285
02:28:50,241 --> 02:28:55,241
because it's lunch time and I'm all
hungry and all they have is doughnuts here

2286
02:28:55,310 --> 02:28:58,490
or whatever. What, what else
are you procrastinating?

2287
02:28:58,880 --> 02:29:03,860
Also if you're procrastinating or what
do you call it, ending the podcast.

2288
02:29:05,900 --> 02:29:07,850
Maybe you could listen
to that one right now.

2289
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:11,110
I'm trying to explain
this thoroughly so that,

2290
02:29:11,120 --> 02:29:15,850
so we can all have a really good
understanding of what it is and its value.

2291
02:29:15,980 --> 02:29:16,380
That's,

2292
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:20,840
that's it's downloading important me
talking about moments of weakness so you

2293
02:29:20,841 --> 02:29:25,610
can get through them. Yeah.
Next, next comment. Yeah,

2294
02:29:26,150 --> 02:29:30,980
I guess, let me add this
one more thing. Actually,

2295
02:29:31,100 --> 02:29:36,020
you can even take it at moments of triumph
end strength. Oh, and it'll still work.

2296
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:38,640
You'll just want to do
it more, you know? Yeah.

2297
02:29:38,990 --> 02:29:42,770
It's like drinking coffee when you're
not tired. You know what I mean? Yeah.

2298
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:45,020
Double Down,
let that sink in.

2299
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:50,570
Psychological warfare on I tunes, Amazon
Music, all these music, Google play,

2300
02:29:50,690 --> 02:29:53,810
Google play. I think the, I think it's
on everything. Cool, but yeah, man.

2301
02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:55,760
Right on. All right. I'll see.

2302
02:29:55,761 --> 02:30:00,761
You can get Jocko white tea on Amazon
and when you order Jocko white tea,

2303
02:30:01,880 --> 02:30:06,880
make sure you also order more weights
for your barbells because you're dead.

2304
02:30:08,361 --> 02:30:11,690
Lift is going to go up to
approximately 8,000 lbs,

2305
02:30:11,720 --> 02:30:14,660
so you need to get that much
weights when you order it.

2306
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:16,910
Weigh the warrior kid book.

2307
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:22,870
It's been out for a couple of weeks
now and thank you for getting it.

2308
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:28,000
Also little warning that someone
put on Amazon in their review.

2309
02:30:30,440 --> 02:30:33,680
I thought it was worth hearing and
thinking about parents be ready.

2310
02:30:33,681 --> 02:30:36,860
I bought this book after listening to
Jocko on the Joe Rogan podcast where Jocko

2311
02:30:36,861 --> 02:30:38,690
was the guest.
Great podcast,

2312
02:30:38,691 --> 02:30:41,900
bought the book after Learning
Jocko has a book for kids.

2313
02:30:41,960 --> 02:30:45,830
My son who isn't very motivated yet,

2314
02:30:45,980 --> 02:30:48,830
was excited about the book when
he started reading the book,

2315
02:30:48,831 --> 02:30:51,050
a fire lit underneath
him. He said to me, Dad,

2316
02:30:51,051 --> 02:30:53,720
I'm going to get up tomorrow at 5:00 AM,
will you get up with me?

2317
02:30:54,290 --> 02:30:57,500
And that moment I realized
that I was what I was going,

2318
02:30:57,501 --> 02:30:59,930
what was going on and I
couldn't let him down.

2319
02:31:00,140 --> 02:31:02,420
I enjoy my sleep like everyone else,

2320
02:31:03,020 --> 02:31:06,650
but I was amazed that my son got excited.
So are applied? Yes, let's do it.

2321
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:10,070
Got Up at 5:00 AM and his alarm
clock must not have gone off,

2322
02:31:10,071 --> 02:31:12,590
but I turned on his light in
his bedroom and he got right up.

2323
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:15,320
He got his clothes and shoes
on and we went for a jog.

2324
02:31:15,321 --> 02:31:16,820
We've never done this before.

2325
02:31:17,960 --> 02:31:21,870
I had him do some sit and
pushups after and he gladly did.

2326
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:26,880
Couldn't quite do pushups if that's
okay, we'll get there. Long Story Short,

2327
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:30,960
this book only being a few chapters and
the only a few chapters in that was kind

2328
02:31:30,961 --> 02:31:34,920
of surprised when I saw that only a few
chapters in made the book worth getting

2329
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:38,700
in this day and age of
electronics and iPads and tablets.

2330
02:31:38,700 --> 02:31:41,910
Kids don't seem to be as motivated
to do activities as when I was a kid.

2331
02:31:41,911 --> 02:31:46,911
I'm 39 so I edified him after for making
the decision to get up at 5:00 AM on a

2332
02:31:48,121 --> 02:31:52,440
non school day and I told him that he
can apply that mentality to anything in

2333
02:31:52,441 --> 02:31:54,090
life. Boom, way the war your kid.

2334
02:31:54,091 --> 02:31:57,930
Get it for your kid to be prepared
to get yourself back in the game.

2335
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:01,200
Also,
discipline equals freedom field manual,

2336
02:32:01,680 --> 02:32:04,460
the instructional manual
for getting after it.

2337
02:32:04,890 --> 02:32:09,690
Feel free to preorder that one. Also,
extreme ownership, combat leadership,

2338
02:32:11,430 --> 02:32:14,580
combat leadership and
also combat leadership.

2339
02:32:15,390 --> 02:32:16,440
That's what the book is about,

2340
02:32:16,441 --> 02:32:19,710
how to apply the fundamental principles
of combat leadership to your business

2341
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:23,700
and to your life.

2346
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:48,810
July 13th and 14th at the Omni
Barton Creek resort. No fluff.

2347
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:50,520
Okay.

2348
02:32:50,520 --> 02:32:52,020
No,
there's no fluff.

2349
02:32:52,470 --> 02:32:57,470
Just pragmatic information
you can act on immediately.

2350
02:32:58,710 --> 02:33:00,870
You can literally in a break,

2351
02:33:00,900 --> 02:33:05,900
email your team and give instructions
that's going to move them in the right

2352
02:33:07,351 --> 02:33:11,220
direction. In the Austin
Monster, there's only 300 seats,

2353
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:15,440
smaller venue
it's going to sell out.

2354
02:33:16,480 --> 02:33:16,740
Okay,

2355
02:33:16,740 --> 02:33:20,010
so get online,
get registered.

2356
02:33:20,011 --> 02:33:22,200
If you can't make it to that one
to come to San Diego in September,

2357
02:33:22,830 --> 02:33:27,480
September 14th and 15th from muster zero
zero four will be there live and while

2358
02:33:27,481 --> 02:33:30,780
you're waiting for the monster,
if you need to communicate with us,

2359
02:33:31,230 --> 02:33:34,590
you can find us on the interwebs,

2360
02:33:35,220 --> 02:33:40,130
on Twitter or on Instagram,
on death. Facey ball high

2361
02:33:43,140 --> 02:33:48,140
echo is at echocharles and I am at Jocko
Willink and to the military personnel

2362
02:33:50,071 --> 02:33:52,590
out there holding the line in places.

2363
02:33:52,591 --> 02:33:56,640
No one wants to be doing things
that no one else wants to do.

2364
02:33:57,690 --> 02:34:02,580
Thanks for keeping US free to police
law enforcement, firefighters,

2365
02:34:02,581 --> 02:34:04,770
EMT,
and other first responders.

2366
02:34:05,610 --> 02:34:07,980
Thanks for keeping us safe.

2367
02:34:09,330 --> 02:34:09,740
Okay,

2368
02:34:09,740 --> 02:34:11,900
and for everyone else out there.

2369
02:34:12,830 --> 02:34:13,400
Yeah.

2370
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:14,360
Remember,

2371
02:34:15,050 --> 02:34:20,050
remember what human are
capable of suffering through
and remember that even in

2372
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:23,620
those situations,

2373
02:34:24,840 --> 02:34:25,550
okay,

2374
02:34:25,550 --> 02:34:28,640
where everything seems to be taken away,

2375
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:32,840
when you seem to have no
choice at all in the world,

2376
02:34:34,370 --> 02:34:35,203
remember,

2377
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:42,520
remember that you can still choose how
you react to the things around you.

2378
02:34:43,761 --> 02:34:46,580
You can still choose your attitude

2379
02:34:48,530 --> 02:34:53,530
and you can still choose to
actualize the best person

2380
02:34:56,110 --> 02:34:57,100
that you can be.

2381
02:34:57,990 --> 02:34:58,823
Okay?

2382
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:02,760
In every aspect of your life,
you can choose

2383
02:35:04,590 --> 02:35:09,560
to get after it.
So until next time,

2384
02:35:10,490 --> 02:35:12,530
this is echo and Jocko

2385
02:35:14,050 --> 02:35:14,380
out.
