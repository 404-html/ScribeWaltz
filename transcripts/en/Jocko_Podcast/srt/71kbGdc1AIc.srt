00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,890
This is Jocko podcast number
one 18 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,780
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,630
I need a mission.

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,480
We all need a mission.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,280
That's what life should be is a mission.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,740
That's what gives your life purpose
and focus and drive and ultimately

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,200
satisfaction.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,120
Now that mission can
be the job you work at.

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:47,470
It can be providing for your family or
it can be getting better at Jujitsu or

10
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,670
stronger at Olympic lifting or starting
a business that you want to grow and

11
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:54,470
build and take over the world.

12
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,610
And sometimes people ask me what to do
if they don't know what their mission is

13
00:01:02,891 --> 00:01:04,600
or what their mission should be.

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,410
And I tell them if they're in
that situation to go help someone,

15
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,200
go help someone else.

16
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,670
Make that your mission because
that will make you better.

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,640
It'll make the world better.

18
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,990
And eventually from that you'll
see what your mission is.

19
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Now I was lucky because from
a young age I had a mission.

20
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,090
I want it to be some kind of commando.

21
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,130
And eventually I ended up hearing about
the seal teams and decided that that was

22
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,490
the best place for me.

23
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,090
And that's where I went.
And once I got to the seal teams,

24
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,940
I had a new mission,
which was to prepare for war.

25
00:02:06,941 --> 00:02:08,560
And that's what we did.

26
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,860
And then eventually
war came.

27
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,820
And then that was the mission

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,320
to take the fight to the enemy to close
with and destroy them through close

29
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,970
combat.
And that's what we did.

30
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,260
But eventually
for me

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,740
and for everyone in the military,
it ends

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,600
maybe because of retirement or maybe
because of family obligations or maybe for

33
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:54,390
medical reasons, but for
every warrior, eventually

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,310
the war ends

35
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,160
and that career ends.
And that mission ends.

36
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,700
And I've talked a lot on this podcast
about how important it is to find a new

37
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,754
mission.

38
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,850
Once the war is over for you
and you've done your part,

39
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,800
you have to find a new mission.

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,080
Well
tonight we have a guest on

41
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,280
who pursued much the same mission as me

42
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,960
for as long as he could and who has
now found a new mission that he is on.

43
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,553
So

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,430
Dan Crenshaw, welcome to the
podcast. Thanks Jack. [inaudible].

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,640
Pleasure to be here with you.
Real honor. Thanks for coming on.

46
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,330
And let's just start at the beginning
a little bit for people that don't know

47
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:05,260
who you are. Let's talk a little bit
about, I guess we'll talk about Katy,

48
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:10,261
Texas and at the same time also
include Ecuador and Columbia about your

49
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:16,690
childhood. Absolutely. Well,
like you said, I grew up in Katy,

50
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,690
Texas,
um,

51
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:22,780
at six generations of and flowing through
me and my dad's side of the family.

52
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
And, uh, my dad was in the oil
and gas industry our whole lives.

53
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:31,441
So when you hear the things about a
Ecuador and Colombia and even Egypt in

54
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:36,100
Scotland, that goes all the places
we lived over the years. Um,

55
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,500
because it is a cause of his career.

56
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,640
Everybody and anybody in the oil and
gas industry in Texas knows that it's,

57
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:44,950
it's a pretty common theme. Um, you know,

58
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,820
I like to talk about some
of the challenges that I
went through from an early

59
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,080
age and uh, what kind of, what drove
me or it may be, and maybe drove my,

60
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,570
that, that get past that mental capacity
that you need to become a seal. And um,

61
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,470
that started with my mother
and my mother got, um,

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,880
diagnosed with breast cancer and I was
five years old and she fought it hard for

63
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:11,770
five years and she never quit. She
never complained. I never saw it.

64
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,110
And if she did, I never saw it. And um,

65
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,940
and she just took care of me and my
brother every day right up until the end.

66
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,320
Man. Now she eventually lost that
battle when I was 10 years old, 1994.

67
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,560
But she instilled in me,
you know what I,

68
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,140
what I think are American and
Texas values of integrity,

69
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,060
respect and it just never quit.
Never quit no matter what.

70
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,380
And don't feel sorry for
yourself. Um, cause she never did.

71
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,640
She truly never did.

72
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:47,470
And she asked where she told me before
she died that I would sort of great

73
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:51,760
heights and I don't know what that meant
at the time. Um, but I think we know now,

74
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,030
and I'm not long after that,
you know,

75
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,130
when I could start reading
books and m and uh,

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,280
in grabbed the first navy seal Dick
Marcinko novel rogue warrior that I could

77
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,040
be, your book wasn't out yet,
taco otherwise maybe I'll, yeah,

78
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,220
rogue warrior that, that, that came out
when I was already in it. Matter of fact,

79
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:16,880
it came out right as I
showed up at the teams. It,

80
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,890
I'm pretty sure that's right when it came
out and obviously created some turmoil

81
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,900
and the teams,
but it was pretty interesting,

82
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:26,240
especially because I knew
guys that had worked for,

83
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,810
for Dick Marcinko and that was pretty
interesting to talk with them. And,

84
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,630
and to be totally frank with you,

85
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,550
most of the guys that work for
Dick Marcinko loved him. And,

86
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,900
and as a matter of fact, one of them, a
couple of the guys that I respect, my,

87
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,970
there's one guy as a matter of fact,
that that I work for.

88
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,450
And this was a couple of years later.
It's a matter of fact,

89
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:51,380
it was around 1994 because I was in a
seal platoon and I was talking to this guy

90
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:54,500
that had worked for, for Dick
Marcinko and I said, hey, you know,

91
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:59,030
how was Dick Marcinko? I wasn't to work
for him. And he looked at me, he said,

92
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,920
best CEO ever. Yeah. And this was from
a guy that I have utmost respect for.

93
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:07,420
So I thought that was pretty cool. Even
though you know his book, you know,

94
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,840
the book is, it's, I'd say
it's a Hollywood ish book. And,

95
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,980
and you know the,

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,730
the statement in there that everyone
always laughs about in the teams is the

97
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:21,440
statement that every seal on his
team could bench press 500 pounds.

98
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,670
The number game. We're not going, we're
not even going to make it realistic.

99
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,800
We're not going to make it realistic.

100
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,530
And we're just going straight to
500 pounds, everyone on the team.

101
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,590
And that's just a patently untrue.

102
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,030
And what sucks is when you do that
with that thing, well then you,

103
00:07:38,031 --> 00:07:39,610
then people start looking
at the book and going, well,

104
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,130
what is true and what is not? Right. So,

105
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,590
and although from the way it's been
described to me, the events in that book,

106
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,240
a lot of them are compiled.

107
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,840
So like this little thing happened on a
training event and this thing happened

108
00:07:50,841 --> 00:07:52,550
on training event and this thing
happened on a training event,

109
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,830
but they'd all be compiled
into one big story. And yeah,

110
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,890
so it's kind of like a Hollywood,
it's a book.

111
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:02,930
It's a nonfiction ish. 10 year old
Ben Crenshaw. I didn't know that.

112
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,300
He was like, I'm going to bench
500 pounds. No problem. Yeah,

113
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:12,380
I wouldn't, I wouldn't be here without
the, that series of books, frankly.

114
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,090
I probably still have two eyes,
but no, nobody. That's a luxury

115
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,910
that we'll get to that in a little, in
a little bit. Um, so yeah, I mean that,

116
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,590
you know,
once you've,

117
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,060
once that and you know this and most
seals operate this way or at least they

118
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:33,740
have this same story of we had,
it was from a young age I had a mission.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,560
Um, I knew what it was and
every decision I made from,

120
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,670
from then until the moment
I got into Bud's was, was,

121
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,630
was just to prepare for
that. Now when you, did you,

122
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,900
I know you lived overseas, what,
where'd you go to high school?

123
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,610
So most of high school and Columbia.
Okay. What did you play sports down there?

124
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,990
I played soccer. Okay. Yeah.

125
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,010
Cause you were in Colombia have kind
of like what they had to play soccer or

126
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:05,040
volleyball. I played volleyball.
And then you applied from college?

127
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:08,090
From Colombia, yeah. Okay. This is,

128
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,470
this is kind of an important question
because a lot of people ask me this

129
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,260
question all the time.
You were definitely want it to be a seal.

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,910
What made you make the decision between
going to college and you ended up going

131
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,940
to Tufts? Yeah. Ended up in Massachusetts.

132
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,000
So at some point you said to yourself,
okay,

133
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:29,280
I could enlist tomorrow and
go to bootcamp and you know,

134
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,170
be a seal within the year,

135
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,860
or I can go to college for four years
and then apply and I'll be in an officer

136
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,330
in a leadership position. I could ask
that question all the time. For me,

137
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,470
when I was 18 years old, the
answer was real easy. Like, oh,

138
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:51,150
I can be a seal of in a year, sign
me up. And, and that's what I did.

139
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,470
And for you,

140
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:55,860
you obviously took a different approach
and people ask me all the time,

141
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,491
which one is better?

142
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,520
And I think I tell them that there's
advantages and disadvantages to both of

143
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,540
them. But what made you decide you're
gonna go officer style from the get go?

144
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,940
Um, maybe along with my mission
of being a seal my whole life,

145
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,390
the a similar mission of I
wanted a college degree as well.

146
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,470
I wanted to knock that out.
And um, and then, you know,

147
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,130
I wasn't well informed enough to,

148
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,270
to really speak about the difference
between officer and enlisted back then,

149
00:10:21,271 --> 00:10:24,210
like I am now. Um, but I
did want a leadership role.

150
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,030
It was important to me
based on what I'd read.

151
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:30,660
And based on the movies I'd seen
that I was in a leadership role.

152
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,540
Did you see navy seals?
Was that, that's nice.

153
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,940
That's Lafe baboons answer to why you
became a seal straight up. He's like,

154
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,830
Oh yeah,
Charlie Seals Charlie Sheen gets out

155
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,260
of, I'd be that, didn't just see it,
you know, we had it on all the time.

156
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,700
Greatest movie ever. Um, it, you know,

157
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:55,290
it was so a combination of wanting a
leadership role, um, maybe knowing too,

158
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,150
was I really ready at age 18? I
knew I wanted it, but I am also,

159
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,350
I also wanted to be prepared and it was
able to think ahead enough to know that

160
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:09,240
maybe I can't swim all that great just
yet. We might need some more practice.

161
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,510
Um, but uh, but it was mostly like, it was
mostly, I'm going to go to college first,

162
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:20,160
then my life path, that's what I'm
going to do. And so that's what I did.

163
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,330
And I ended up at Tufts University mostly
because of its international relations

164
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:28,440
program. I was that, that was my
focus. It was foreign affairs,

165
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:31,190
international relations,
politics and a,

166
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,710
and I did a minor in physics just because,
why not?

167
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,380
Cause that sounds like
fun. Yeah, it's awesome.

168
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,920
Speak Spanish obviously from,
from growing up in Columbia too.

169
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,670
Are you fluent in Spanish?
Pretty fluently.

170
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,200
It's kind of a little rusty but
we're weak. And you did ROTC at? Yes.

171
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:49,861
Was there any seals?

172
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:54,750
They're like a prior seals that were
instructors or anything like that? No, I,

173
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,580
well no, there, there was at Harvard.

174
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:01,330
So a lot of these guys doing master's
programs while we're doing ROTC,

175
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,470
they're not attached to the unit.

176
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,980
But I did have the opportunity to
work with some guys and um, you know,

177
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,150
just get that mentorship. You just, hey,

178
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,070
this is the kind of workouts you
might want to be doing. I mean,

179
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:14,830
just the basics cause you just
have no idea going into it.

180
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,090
Do you think kids over
prepare for buds now? Um,

181
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,920
I think it depends on the kid.

182
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,950
I often mentor guys who want to go through
and you know that sometimes they do

183
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,370
focus a little bit too much on,
especially things that are good at,

184
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,910
like I'm running 10 miles a day. It's
kind of like a five minute pace. I'm like,

185
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,160
stop running, never run again. You know,

186
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,730
you're good at that and move on
to the next thing. Uh, you know,

187
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:41,160
focus on your weaknesses. It, look,

188
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,480
guys just don't understand
the little little basics.

189
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:46,510
I don't know if they overtrain I haven't
worked with enough to really know,

190
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,580
but I talked to people and they send
me messages all the time and they're on

191
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:56,500
this two year training program to
get ready for buds and I'm like, hey,

192
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,800
train for two months and then go,
don't,

193
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,180
it's not that hard if you played a sport
in college or have you played a sport

194
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,450
in high school and you can run like
you'll get in good shape there and it's

195
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,370
going to be a challenge.
But waiting around,

196
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,620
especially when there's a war going on
that you don't really want to miss. Yeah,

197
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,470
that's a big deal to me.
You know,

198
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:18,040
and I told these guys this war's not
going to last forever. And you know,

199
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:22,750
I showed up at the team in 1991 just
missed the first call for it. And it's,

200
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,990
you know, we, I,

201
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:28,990
I didn't shoot my weapon at the
enemy for 13 years and that's a long,

202
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,980
dry hard 13 years. And so, yeah,

203
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,970
you don't wanna miss out on that snow.
You don't, one of my old team guy buddies,

204
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,620
it was like 1971 and,
and he loved,

205
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,790
he thought the Vietnam War was going to
end and he's down at the Marine Corps

206
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,610
Recruiter Tang. I want to
be a door gunner. Huey.

207
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,190
It's interesting that there's the,
you know,

208
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:54,310
you always hear about the
protesters and whatnot,

209
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,360
but there's kids that want to fight.
Oh yeah.

210
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:00,963
We do have,

211
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:05,170
there's a warrior class in America that
I think we should be proud of and it'd

212
00:14:05,171 --> 00:14:06,520
be proud to be a part of because it's a,

213
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,300
they're good people with good values and
they want to do the right thing for the

214
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:14,180
country. So you show up the buds so
you get to be good done with college.

215
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,270
College is college,
right?

216
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,440
Is there anything particularly you want
to say about college? No. Okay. Well cool.

217
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,270
We want to hear about
college happened college.

218
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,750
And so you show up at buds
and any issues at buds.

219
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,040
Yeah. Um, you know, I started my,
I started with class two, six,

220
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,460
one about Tuesday afternoon
of my first hell week. My,

221
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,220
I stress fractured, developed into a
pretty noticeable fracture. And uh,

222
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,790
I got the old question, are you
hurt? Are you injured, Mr Crenshaw?

223
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,040
And you really want to be
injured because you better not

224
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,610
just be hurt because then you're
just quitting. And uh, I was,

225
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,590
I was injured pretty substantially.
I mean, you know, I mean,

226
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,430
we stress fractures are pretty
normal injury in buds. Okay. So you,

227
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,220
so when I'm sitting here talking about
people don't prep enough, you're like,

228
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:08,240
actually you should prep more.

229
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,300
Do you think you could have run more
preparing for bucks? I would have.

230
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,520
I ran plenty. I would've, uh,

231
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,120
I would've focused a little bit more
on strength and conditioning. You know,

232
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,410
something I just didn't know
how to do back then. Right.

233
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,850
Because what happens in buds as you,
I mean,

234
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:26,150
you're going to go to failure and w you're
going to go to failure no matter what

235
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,540
you're in. It's going to happen on the
hour, every hour, maybe every 10 minutes,

236
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,120
all the time. So the guys
who overprepare, they,

237
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,710
they can't understand why they're
failing so much. Right. And that,

238
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:37,940
that messes with their heads.

239
00:15:37,941 --> 00:15:41,360
So maybe that's what you mean
by overpreparing cause that,

240
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,920
that's what I mean by like,
I think,

241
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,490
I think guys get too confident in their
abilities and they just don't understand

242
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,050
why they're hitting a wall all the time
where it's like guys like me are just

243
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:55,890
like, I just, I just, I expected to
suck, so it's really not a surprise. Um,

244
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,580
but we're just going to keep trying
no matter what and just never quit.

245
00:15:58,581 --> 00:16:02,510
And quitting is never an option.
The other problem is if you over prepare,

246
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,810
it may be, it becomes an option.
This isn't the case for everybody,

247
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:09,260
but I see some of the best in shape
guys quit because it was just,

248
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,470
they were like, maybe it was an option
for them. Like maybe I'll make it,

249
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:16,580
maybe I won't. But if you, you should
never go into bud's thinking that way.

250
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,730
And um, that's why a lot of
guys who make it through,

251
00:16:19,731 --> 00:16:22,880
I think have this story that, well, I
wanted to do it since I was 10 years old.

252
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:27,830
So it was just never an option
for me to ever quit. So yeah,

253
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:29,420
you do need prepare
enough to make sure your,

254
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,990
your muscles when they do fail aren't
putting all the strain on your joints and

255
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,790
your knees.

256
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,430
And that's what happened to me because
it just happened over time and over time

257
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,170
you're limping a certain
way and that just,

258
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,660
that causes a fracture eventually cause
there's too much pressure being put on

259
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:45,290
your bones. So, you know, or
I just had a week genetics,

260
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,360
which is like one story where
likely answer, I got rolled back,

261
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,930
I came back again with two, six, four.
And um, you know, you know, you know,

262
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,360
there's the two mile
run you do in hell week.

263
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,000
It's like Tuesday or so if how we can,

264
00:16:59,001 --> 00:17:01,040
it's a time you went
through a long time ago.

265
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,050
Well it's like a Tuesday or something
and it's a time to run and if you,

266
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,560
and if you get in the top five,

267
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:09,860
you don't have to do it again and then
everybody else has to do it all over

268
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,610
again and you get to rest under a boat
and you know, eat sand or whatever.

269
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:18,410
They let you do much on
that sand over there. At,

270
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,530
uh,
my first hell week I was dead last.

271
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:24,800
I mean just we'll way be
like not even close. Right.

272
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,950
Cause I was limping the whole time
and my second hell week I was,

273
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:30,920
I was first placed by maybe five minutes,
you know,

274
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,530
and maybe cause I knew what the game was,

275
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:37,970
but everybody does actually because the
word gets around it, you know that it's,

276
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,200
but it was, it was, it was a message
maybe to myself of like we're gonna,

277
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,090
we're gonna not only do this but we're
going to crush it and I'm going to feel

278
00:17:47,091 --> 00:17:49,560
good about it and I'm going to rest
under that boat and eat my sand

279
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,610
while everybody else is running
the, frankly, it was really cold.

280
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:56,490
So I kind of wish I'd been running
at the time, but whatever I want,

281
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,590
the closest store I have to that is we
got done with a four mile time, Brian.

282
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,060
And when we got done that people
that failed and I didn't fail,

283
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,740
but there was a bunch
of people that failed.

284
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,340
And the instructor who is a
really a perfect instructor,

285
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:18,710
meaning that his attitude and the way
he carried himself was epic for buds.

286
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,860
And he was the senior chief of the phase.
It was dive phase.

287
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,760
And the guys come across and he's
collecting the guys that fail,

288
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,780
which was probably at least half of
the class and then, you know, he says,

289
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:33,600
you know, because I'm fair, I'm gonna
go ahead and let you do this time.

290
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,180
Don't again get on the line, ready, go.

291
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,500
And everyone had to run another four
mile time to run. Right. Well not us,

292
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,620
but the people that,
the people that passed got to not be,

293
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,310
but the people that didn't pass,
which was half the class,

294
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,670
had to go and just run another form of
time to run right then to see if they

295
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:51,180
could then pass it.
Much easier to pass.

296
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,951
Eighth Mile.

297
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,950
You're definitely doing a lot better
after you've put out as hard as you

298
00:18:55,951 --> 00:18:58,180
possibly good for a four mile run,

299
00:18:58,181 --> 00:19:02,220
which I actually had to do every time
I failed to run and I failed one run in

300
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:05,970
bugs. I paced myself. I said, well,
you know what? I'll just pace myself.

301
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm not going to put out as
hard as I as a kind of, I'll,

302
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,980
I'll save a little bit for
later and that didn't work.

303
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,760
I failed because I'm not a fast runner.
And so from then on it was just a sprint.

304
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,970
As hard as I could go for the
whole damn time, unlike you,

305
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:22,590
I didn't win any races in buds.
That's literally not.

306
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,670
So you get done with and you show up.
So now it's 2000 and what?

307
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:28,470
What year is it a,

308
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,070
this is 2007 2007 yeah.

309
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,910
Finishing bugs 2007 and I'm
moving in SQT Oh, that's right,

310
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:40,590
Leif Babin putting me through
[inaudible] nice. You know, I was,

311
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:45,210
I was, I was indoctrinated
early on bruiser stories.

312
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,300
Jack, Jack, and that's awesome.

313
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,020
And then from there you rolled
two team three, team three,

314
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,380
team three with collusion in 2008 and
then I'm back in Ramadi in 2010 with a

315
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,160
tribe platoon, you know, your little
troupe, you know, going back to life,

316
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,881
running that course.

317
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:06,930
It was interesting because what that
course used to be was almost like an

318
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,840
administrator course, hey,
here's how you write evils.

319
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,700
And they had a little tiny bit of dashing
of, of, of tactics in it, but it was,

320
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,290
here's how you read,
right evils,

321
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,930
here's how you write navy messages
and just that kind of stuff. Yeah.

322
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:24,240
And you know, we knew that these kids
needed to train because I, in Ramadi,

323
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:26,520
I had guys that were the
first platoon guys out,

324
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,730
ground force commanders and we wanted to
make sure these guys knew what to do on

325
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,620
the battlefield and it was awesome
that lake and went there and started

326
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,190
rehashing that program and the, and did a
great job. I think it was very valuable.

327
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,990
Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, so
then you got done with that,

328
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,850
then you showed up at team three and you
went right on deployment. Right. I mean,

329
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,340
the three was already on deployment,

330
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,920
so they had just deployed, you know,
and you know how that goes. Um,

331
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,120
the cycle of graduates.
So we met up with team three.

332
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,080
I was in Fallujah for a little while.
Uh,

333
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:01,900
it was done in Bosnia for few months and
actually stayed on deployment to meet

334
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:06,280
up with team five and, and, um, and,
and help them transition. You know,

335
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:11,230
as we were setting up another, uh,
uh, debt out there and Bosnia, um,

336
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:11,920
great,

337
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,750
great first deployment and learned a
lot and got to work a little bit and uh,

338
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,820
then came back to Iraq in 2010 and another
great deployment for me because I was

339
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:24,390
able to take over as platoon commander,
uh,

340
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:28,170
when my platoon OIC had to go
to relieve another platoon OIC.

341
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,500
So we were going through
the entire targeting cycle,

342
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:36,220
working with multiple Iraqi partners
throughout Ramadi and throughout all,

343
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,330
all of Al Anbar.

344
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:40,510
We got to operate throughout the entire
province even a little bit in Baghdad.

345
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,000
So,
uh,

346
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,090
just an amazing experience for young
Jio who wouldn't normally be put in that

347
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,780
position. And, uh, working with some of
the best people I've ever met. You know,

348
00:21:49,781 --> 00:21:53,830
we've talked about before. Uh, I won't
name names on the, uh, on the podcast,

349
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,450
you know. Well, your OIC was, it
was a great guy that got moved.

350
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:00,450
That's why he got moved and obviously
they had confidence in you too,

351
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,870
to move you up in to the
platoon commander position,

352
00:22:03,871 --> 00:22:08,340
which is an interesting thing.
I had a group of business people and they,

353
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,530
they, there was a guy that kept saying,
well, no one can take my place, you know,

354
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,750
and then he was surprised that
he wasn't getting promoted.

355
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,470
And you explain to people,

356
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,190
if you don't have a person below you
in the chain of command or two or three

357
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:25,290
people below you in the chain of
command that can take your job,

358
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,270
well then you're going to have to stay
in your job and you're not going to get

359
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:32,160
promoted. So that, that's, that's
proof that you're OIC. Like I said,

360
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:34,770
he's a great guy, actually. He's supposed
to come on the podcast at some point,

361
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,040
but he's a great guy and he had groomed
you and taught you everything he could

362
00:22:41,131 --> 00:22:44,550
do and, and made you ready and
trusted you to say when the,

363
00:22:44,551 --> 00:22:46,560
when the boss came to him and
said, Hey, I've got to fire a guy.

364
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,710
I'm going to move you over to Afghanistan.
Is Your,

365
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:53,310
is your AYC ready to take
over? And he could constantly
say yes, he is. And that's,

366
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,120
that's awesome. And that shows
that he was a great leader too,

367
00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,980
to kind of prepare you
properly for that situation.

368
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,970
That's a good point. I mean, that is,
that is part of leadership and management.

369
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:09,320
It's making sure that below you and
above you is squared away. Yeah.

370
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:14,380
And I would do that when I was running
training, I would always kill, you know,

371
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,180
theoretically or what does it
virtually kill the commander's. Yeah.

372
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,440
All of us. The 10 sometimes I'd
kill all of you that I remember.

373
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,620
Yeah.
There'd be some,

374
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,790
some somebody carries happening
for extended distances.

375
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,040
Uh, yeah, I was a little bit,

376
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,930
I was a little bit crazy at that point
and, and you know, I was good training.

377
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,030
Yeah. Yeah. You know, it's, uh,

378
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,750
I was coming home from Ramadi and I
wanted to make sure you guys were ready to

379
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,020
ready for the worst
possible case, you know? Um,

380
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,670
so then you get, so you do that,
you finished out that deployment.

381
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,820
That was a solid deployment. You were,
you were running a bunch of stuff that,

382
00:23:54,821 --> 00:23:57,410
that sounds like a good deal then
what'd you do when you came back?

383
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,820
So he came back, um, moved
over to support activity one.

384
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,300
And as you know,
they,

385
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:07,280
they run intelligence support
operations for the seal teams. Uh, it's,

386
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:11,920
it's a fairly normal transition to make
as an officer and for a lot of guys too.

387
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:16,340
Um, but what that ended up w would really
what that translated into his back on

388
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:20,570
deployment 2012 with my platoon again,
seal team three Charlie Platoon, uh,

389
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,450
in Kandahar province. So
on that deployment, uh,

390
00:24:24,451 --> 00:24:28,610
this was one of our more
kinetic deployments. I mean,
it's, it's Afghanistan,

391
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:32,300
it's Kandahar's IED is everywhere.
I mean everywhere.

392
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,530
I mean to the point where, you
know, our, our TTPs are, are,

393
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,910
are sparse or our sop is our standard
operating procedures where, hey,

394
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,160
we're on patrol, were getting
shot at, don't even move.

395
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,810
Don't even go look for cover. Because
as soon as you move, you hit an IED.

396
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,480
I mean they're,
they're,

397
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,520
they're just there that prevalent
throughout the entire ground,

398
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:56,510
not just on pathways, not just in
doorways, in the most random of places.

399
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:00,620
These guys are just burying these
things at a one, at a win, you know?

400
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:02,420
And then it's,
then it's chaos out there.

401
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,700
And we know they're not that
great at shooting at us.

402
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:06,230
So we'd rather just take it.

403
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,280
So I'm going to take a moment just to
emphasize what you just said because it's

404
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:13,760
really important and not everyone
will understand it the way you,

405
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,330
the way you went over it quickly,
almost from a tactical mindset.

406
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:19,540
So I just want everyone
to understand what he's,

407
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,280
what he's saying is when at this point,

408
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:27,281
the ids were so bad that if you
started getting shot at by the enemy,

409
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,210
the obvious and common and practice that
everyone in the world instinctively and

410
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:38,870
by training has, is you immediately
hit the ground and seek cover.

411
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,230
And you get behind a log.
You get behind a piece of terrain,

412
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:45,260
you find somewhere to hide from
the bullets that are coming at you.

413
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,410
And what Dan's saying is
during this deployment,

414
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:52,430
the IED threat was so high that when
the enemy started shooting at them,

415
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:55,610
instead of finding cover
to hide from the bullets,

416
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
they would rather just stay put,

417
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,970
probably take a knee but not dive behind
something because of the likely there

418
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:07,940
was a likely chance that there was an IED
there. Yup. That's, that's crazy. It is.

419
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,620
It is. Um, you know, we've,
I've seen multiple guys get,

420
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,500
get blown up and, um,
usually our partners,

421
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,360
our Afghan partners who were patrolling
with us, I, because, you know,

422
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,430
maybe they don't, they're just not
as careful or maybe they're there.

423
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,730
The equipment they're using
to detect ICDs in the ground,

424
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,010
they weren't using it properly,
whatever the case may be.

425
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:32,250
Or maybe just cause it's bad luck and
they're just everywhere. Um, you know,

426
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,710
it's more, you had more Afghan
partners than Americans. Oh, by far.

427
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,720
We would sometimes go on operations with
about a hundred Afghans and maybe 12,

428
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:44,160
15 seals. Yeah. Because there were, were

429
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,280
doing entire clearance operations
through villages. You know, we're,

430
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:49,690
we're going house to house,
we're shaking hands.

431
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:53,200
It's a little bit of shaking hands. It's
a little bit of on security, you know,

432
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,200
either defending ourselves or
going on the offensive. It,

433
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,940
it depends on the situation. But,
um, you know, we round everybody up,

434
00:26:59,941 --> 00:27:04,840
we talked to them and we have, we meet
with village elders. So it's, it's,

435
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,140
it's, it's a little bit
of your, your, your,

436
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,580
I guess your more typical unconventional
warfare tactics of we're trying to meet

437
00:27:11,581 --> 00:27:15,030
and greet the population,
um, while also, you know,

438
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:17,970
being prepared for
battle and, uh, and, and,

439
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:21,780
but the hardest part of that was
certainly the IED threat. You know,

440
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,010
only single file lines.

441
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:26,640
Everything we ever learned in
training of different formations and

442
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,610
staggered actual on whatever it is,
it doesn't apply at all.

443
00:27:32,611 --> 00:27:36,630
It all gets thrown out the window because
it's, it's only about single file.

444
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,390
What has been cleared, what hasn't
been cleared. And you could,

445
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,170
you could veer from that a little
bit depending on what area you're in,

446
00:27:42,171 --> 00:27:45,330
in Kandahar and went more mountainous
areas, less ids. But even then,

447
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,090
I've got a story, you
know, these guys, uh,

448
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:52,230
some of our guys take a take a point to
take out on the high ground and a little

449
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:56,730
hilltop. I mean, just in the middle
of nowhere. I mean, middle of, no,

450
00:27:56,731 --> 00:28:00,660
I can't emphasize this enough. It
is the middle of nowhere, right?

451
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,940
And they sit down in this pop goes off,

452
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,850
it was a blasting cap that went low order,

453
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:09,990
which means it didn't blow up the main
charge, like a 15, 20 pound charge.

454
00:28:09,991 --> 00:28:13,830
It would have killed all three of them
right then and there. And, uh, I mean,

455
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,990
I want to say that again,
middle of nowhere.

456
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:20,080
There was no reason for there to be an
IED right there. But there was this one,

457
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,430
this was out in the mountains and this
wasn't even in the, the pen, you know,

458
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:25,410
the southern Kandahar district,
which was,

459
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:29,630
which is truly just a minefield
everywhere, you know, so, you know, the,

460
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:32,960
I can't emphasize how bad the threat is
there. And even, even, even taking that,

461
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,830
even taking a small high ground
position behind a rock, like, you know,

462
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,860
this is what we, the kind of
things we ran into. And, um,

463
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:46,740
so that was that deployment. It was a
lot of fun. And, uh, um, but it was,

464
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:49,470
it was a hard one for us. Uh, you know,

465
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:51,960
on month six,

466
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,960
that's six months in
is June 15th, 2012. Um,

467
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,630
I was hit by an IED blast by one of these.
Again, they're everywhere. And it was,

468
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:04,000
it was the one day we spent in Helmand
province. So we went to Helmand on a,

469
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:05,780
on a last minute mission,
uh,

470
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,290
to support some marine special
operations forces out there. And,

471
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,840
uh, as, as the early, I know we, oh,

472
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,100
we always fly in about the middle of the
night and we do that so that the enemy

473
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,910
can't arm the ids. The Ids are
everywhere, but they're not always armed.

474
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,340
And if they,
if they keep them arm,

475
00:29:23,341 --> 00:29:26,490
they run out of batteries and they
don't work anymore. So they, so there's,

476
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,200
there's a little bit of tactical
consideration there. But, uh,

477
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:36,150
you know, in the early morning hours come
and the, and the daylight starts to hit,

478
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:41,151
we start to move around and we start to
clear out this one compound and hadn't

479
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,640
been totally clear jet.

480
00:29:42,641 --> 00:29:45,280
And one of my Afghan interpreters
was responding to a call,

481
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,830
runs in front of me and completely
gets dismembered by about 15 pounds of

482
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,140
explosives underneath him. And, uh,

483
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:57,820
all I know is I got hit with something
and it feels like you're getting hit by a

484
00:29:57,821 --> 00:30:01,570
truck while a bunch of guys in the
truck or shooting you with a shotgun.

485
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,670
That's sort of what it feels
like. And um, you know, immediate,

486
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,680
my immediate reaction
was feel my legs right.

487
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,990
So I feel my legs and everything
is still there. Um, you know,

488
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,980
I know something is wrong
distance from the Iud, a couple
of feet. I mean, it's so,

489
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:21,610
I mean, cause I would,
aliyah a few feet were,

490
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,400
you and me are probably is about it.

491
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:29,080
We're just across the table
and uh, you know, lots of pain,

492
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,810
pain everywhere, but not in my eyes. So
that was completely blinded. But, uh,

493
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:37,060
you know, uh, totally under the assumption
that I just had dirt in my eyes. And, uh,

494
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,910
I remained under this assumption that
there was really nothing wrong with my

495
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:44,290
eyes for frankly, for weeks to come.
And we'll talk about that. But,

496
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,760
you know, I, I was, I didn't lose
consciousness. I knew what was happening.

497
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,530
I could hear the moans.

498
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,930
Everybody thinks that when somebody gets
their legs blown off, they're screaming.

499
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:56,620
Like in the movies. It's just never
the case. It's a very different,

500
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:00,700
like visceral sound of pain. Um, and it's,

501
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:04,990
and I've heard it many times now because
this happened to us a couple of times.

502
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,990
And, um, so I heard that. I knew,

503
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,190
I knew that Rockman had been hit
because I could hear him. And, um,

504
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,500
you know,
one of our,

505
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:19,501
one of my teammates tells a story where
he got hit with the foot in a building

506
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,730
next store. I mean, and it was,

507
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,050
and that's how they knew something
had gone terribly wrong. And, uh,

508
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,800
you know, the medics come to me,
there's nothing they can do for me.

509
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,000
They sorta just wrap up my eyes. They
know something's wrong. I really don't.

510
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,380
Frankly,
I was just,

511
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:39,300
I keep assuming there's just dirt in my
eyes and that it'll be fine. And, uh,

512
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:43,270
eventually we get taken out of there
and I was able to get up and walk to the

513
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:47,470
Hilo because you don't let somebody carry
you when they've got a fire fight to

514
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:50,870
finish and we get on and uh,

515
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:52,910
as soon as the medics on
the helicopter see me, they,

516
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:55,390
they put me out right away
and I don't wake up for days.

517
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:00,820
So when I do wake up, I'm in
Germany. They told me my ride,

518
00:32:00,821 --> 00:32:04,780
I had been removed and I'd probably
never see it again out of my left eye.

519
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:08,980
But there's a chance and again, kind of
self deception kicks in and I'm like,

520
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:13,270
so you're saying there's a chance that
we'll be fine, just get the surgery done,

521
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:15,790
get me out of plane to,
to back to Maryland,

522
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:19,480
to the Walter Reed Hospital where these
surgeons are and well, let's do this.

523
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:23,350
And they're like, it's going to be a
day or two. I argue. We argue, you know,

524
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:26,200
that's how it goes for the next
couple days. I can't really move.

525
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,160
I can't get up to use the bathroom. My
body is completely swollen and, and, and,

526
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,620
and shredded really.

527
00:32:32,621 --> 00:32:35,880
I mean there's no real permanent injuries
to the rest of my body, but it's,

528
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,130
it's in such a state that like I just,
just shockwave from

529
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:40,710
the blast,

530
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,730
I think shock and I was,
I had a ton of shrapnel just throughout,

531
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,130
I think I was swollen,
um,

532
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,820
might've been muscle atrophy from being
in a medically induced coma for so long

533
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,640
because I'd been there,
been that way for five or six days,

534
00:32:53,641 --> 00:32:57,240
but really couldn't move. Um, and,

535
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,610
and just wrapped up really
tight cause I mean there's,

536
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,690
you can see the scarring a
little bit. Um, I was just,

537
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:08,310
it was kind of been through a meat
grinder a little bit. And uh, I was also,

538
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:13,080
I was hallucinating wildly so I,
everything I saw was Afghanistan.

539
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,510
I was lucid,
I understood what was around me,

540
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,610
but all I could see was an Afghan guy
sitting next to me or an Afghan village.

541
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,891
It was, it's, it was,

542
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:26,040
it's almost like phantom pain but with
your eyes and there's a medical term for

543
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,080
it that I can't remember.
Um,

544
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,200
but it was just an odd and
terrifying experience because it was,

545
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,460
I knew it wasn't real, but it's
just everything I saw. And, um,

546
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:42,440
eventually got back to Maryland,
um,

547
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,020
on a one on one of our medical
flights. And, you know,

548
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:48,570
my wife was there waiting
for me and you know,

549
00:33:48,571 --> 00:33:51,120
we began to have that conversation
about, okay, what's the next surgery?

550
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:53,730
Cause I had to remove the cataract
and then that was, that was the issue.

551
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:56,850
There was a lot of shrapnel in my left
eye. The eye that was still there.

552
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,660
And you know, the, the, the
issue was, could we came,

553
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:03,360
we were safely removed the cataract
and will he ever see again?

554
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,830
And if you have to be,
we do do that.

555
00:34:04,831 --> 00:34:09,520
What are his chances really of
having decent vision and um,

556
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,570
you know, we, we prayed and we,

557
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:16,980
I and I look back on it and again that,
you know, we call it self deception,

558
00:34:16,981 --> 00:34:20,720
but it was really the
strength to stay sane and,

559
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,130
and believe that it was actually
going to see again. And you know,

560
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,370
I truly believe that was God. Strength
is working through Migos, allowing me to,

561
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,440
to believe in something impossible,
um,

562
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:33,930
because otherwise I would have gone
nuts because people sometimes ask me,

563
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:38,470
what's it like not knowing if you're ever
gonna see again. And I always answer, I,

564
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,640
I don't know. I don't know what
that's like because it was never,

565
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,450
that was never my mental state. My
mental state was always, it'll happen.

566
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:48,480
It's just a matter of time. And then
I can finally get back to my platoon.

567
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:52,260
You know, the, the, the, the issue for me,
it was like, when are we going to do this?

568
00:34:52,261 --> 00:34:56,940
You guys told me six weeks.
All right, let's schedule
it. Inhale. It was insanity.

569
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:01,440
Obviously when a, I hear
this story, I think Ryan Job,

570
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:06,180
who was with me in Ramadi and he,
and he got shot in the face and you know,

571
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,470
it was a similar situation
where, you know, clearly his,

572
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,720
his eye,
one eye was gone,

573
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,110
but his other eye appeared to be intact.

574
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:20,160
And he could actually
see after he got wounded,

575
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,420
then he got put into a, uh, you know,
he could see what was happening and,

576
00:35:24,421 --> 00:35:28,290
and walked into the CAS
evac vehicle. Uh, but,

577
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,200
you know, they put them into
a medically induced coma.

578
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:36,201
And when he woke up he couldn't see and
then it was the same type of thing that

579
00:35:36,591 --> 00:35:40,650
they were, you, they were
telling him which is look,

580
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,110
well there was some nerve damage,
we're not sure.

581
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,200
And his attitude was very similar of
like, well, it'll be okay and you know,

582
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,030
it'll come back. Um, but you know,

583
00:35:51,031 --> 00:35:55,770
what didn't take very long
before the doctors were like, no,

584
00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:00,040
um, it's, it's, it's not coming back.
And, and I forget the timeline, you know,

585
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,250
I forget the timeline cause
it's, it's kind of a kind of, uh,

586
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,520
a blurred together. Um, but yeah,

587
00:36:08,521 --> 00:36:12,660
for him it was, he had a
great attitude, but, um,

588
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:17,760
you know, at the end it
didn't happen. And you know,

589
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,530
and that's a guy that was still like a,

590
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,540
he also still wanted to come back and
get back with his platoon and was telling

591
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,950
me, you know, don't worry, I can smell
the enemy and I'll know where to shoot.

592
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,380
Let me back, sir. So, yeah, uh, the,

593
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,350
the fact that you were able to
recover is awesome. Awesome.

594
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,420
And you know, it's, uh, it, it shows,

595
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:45,750
it should show people that, you know,
even though you had a great attitude,

596
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,210
the threat of have never been able to
see again was very, very real, very,

597
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,044
very real.

598
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,080
Oh yeah. And, and it truly was amazing.

599
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,360
We had miracles occur in the operating
room multiple occasions and, uh,

600
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,780
doctors are just amazed that not only
could I see again, but see, well again,

601
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,170
um, it, it was because they're at,
in their minds they're like, well,

602
00:37:06,171 --> 00:37:11,000
if we do the surgery and his
retina, doesn't it detach?
Like, we think it might, um,

603
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,600
he'll still have, you know,
crappy vision, you know,

604
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:18,860
cause this is corny as all destroyed. I
mean, everything's a mess in this eye and,

605
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,040
uh, you know, we'll get them some decent
glasses so we can kind of live his life,

606
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,270
but he's, he's pretty much permanently
disabled and I'm, I just didn't listen.

607
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,860
I don't even remember these conversations.

608
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:30,850
It's like I like I blocked him
out and, um, and it's just,

609
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,020
cause the first surgery was we've
got to remove the cataract. Okay.

610
00:37:33,021 --> 00:37:36,070
That went well. All right. We removed
the cataract. Great. You know,

611
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,750
and the next step is to put a
lens implant in your eye. Like,

612
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,930
like anybody normally would
only have cataract surgery.

613
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,120
That's just the normal thing to do.
Um,

614
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:48,140
we ended up never doing that because
it's kind of like replacing a window pane

615
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,000
on a normal line,

616
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,220
but if the frame of the window is
completely destroyed and you have to,

617
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:57,070
so the window pane to curtains and
that's never a good policy. So, uh,

618
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,870
they, they eventually refused to do that
on me even though I was demanding it

619
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:02,870
constantly. Um, but because
I wanted to see again,

620
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:05,090
I wanted to get back and I didn't
want to have a big thick glasses,

621
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,450
which is what I have to wear now or,
or this specialized contact.

622
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,480
But then another problem occurred,

623
00:38:11,481 --> 00:38:15,890
which is a hole in my retina that was
expanding and event. And this is again,

624
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:19,430
it's kind of a normal, you
know, I, if if you're over 50,

625
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,880
this might be a normal thing that occurs
and then you have a pretty routine

626
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:27,320
surgery to get rid of it and to stop it.
But for me it was incredibly fragile. Um,

627
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,183
but we had to do it.

628
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,580
So I went blind again for six weeks
recovering from the surgery. So, you know,

629
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,070
I was, I was, I was truly living in
darkness for a long, um, you know,

630
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,250
and not always thank God I wasn't
hallucinating the entire time.

631
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:43,030
That stopped after about
week one. Um, you know, just,

632
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,380
or just after my major surgery,
my first major surgery. But, um,

633
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:51,250
I went blind again and another miracle
happened because they truly thought I

634
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:54,370
wasn't going to make it through that
surgery either. So after when they,

635
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,630
when you were blind to again for six
weeks going into that, did they tell you,

636
00:38:58,631 --> 00:38:58,931
okay,

637
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,470
you're going to be buying for a period
of time and it's going to take time to

638
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,190
you eat just yet, because of
the recovery process. You,

639
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:07,990
they put a gas bubble in your eyes so
that it puts pressure on the back of your

640
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:11,860
retina and you would have to be face down
for six weeks. It's just the weirdest,

641
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,220
what the hell did you do for six weeks?
I down my bed,

642
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,750
I get one of those massage chairs
where you put your face down.

643
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:24,650
And I had audio books going all day
long. I mean, it was great. Yeah.

644
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,270
And by great, I mean, not great at
all. By great you mean awesome. Yeah.

645
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,410
You know, uh, yeah, Starbucks and uh, you,

646
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,540
you had to stay face down
all the time. Are you? Um,

647
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,650
and that six weeks goes by and then they
eventually remove the gas bubble and

648
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,690
dissipates. Yeah. So there's eventually a
point where you're like, okay, it's gone.

649
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:50,530
Now I can, I'm allowed. I'm allowed
to look straight again. And then,

650
00:39:50,531 --> 00:39:54,040
and then it's just, you know, refitting
your eye with the right eyewear, you know,

651
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:57,040
like glasses and contacts so I can
actually get back to her normal life.

652
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,030
And in frankly, that took
years. Uh, it, you know,

653
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:04,660
it's w I eventually, I'll
just, I'll skip to the end,

654
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,930
about two and a half years,
then I finally got,

655
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,960
got referred by the Navy to an
outside clinic that does these,

656
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,890
these amazing contacts.
Um,

657
00:40:14,891 --> 00:40:18,940
there's only one company in the world
that does it and I can see 2020 with it,

658
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,620
you know, not up close. You know,

659
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:22,600
my vision is complicated
because I have a cataract, but,

660
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:27,300
but I actually see 2020 vision at
distance, which is, let me just,

661
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,170
not even close to what they thought was
possible. So I'm in. But despite all that,

662
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,270
I mean,
before that two and a half year mark,

663
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:36,820
I still had decent enough
contacts to survive. I mean,

664
00:40:36,821 --> 00:40:40,700
they just weren't comfortable. They kind
of drove me crazy. And, um, you know,

665
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:42,340
all I cared about was
getting back to the team.

666
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,310
I was almost going back
to team three. The, uh,

667
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,430
command wouldn't let that happen in
the end just because I couldn't get the

668
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,080
medical waiver to do it.

669
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,070
So I stayed at what was now it's called
special reconnaissance team one. Again,

670
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:57,970
we do Intel support for the seal teams
and uh, did a troop commander there.

671
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,440
So in charge of about 50 personnel,
mix of seals,

672
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:06,840
intelligence specialists, um, all sorts
of really great people that you know,

673
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,460
as you know,

674
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:12,130
support the teams and intelligence
matters and deployed to Bahrain,

675
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,550
uh, worked with, uh,

676
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,570
joint special operations task force
out there working in all throughout the

677
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,400
Persian Gulf, uh, working
on classified programs.

678
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:25,360
They're working in Lebanon as well.
And uh, coming back from that,

679
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,360
I'm told I had to eventually
get out. I mean, I,

680
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:33,980
I had to start the medical
retirement process, but before,

681
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,640
before I did, I, I truly, I wanted
to serve again. I mean, it was,

682
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:41,330
it was extremely important to me. So this
deployment to by rain was about 2014.

683
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,070
By the time I was really told I had
to medically retire was around 2016.

684
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,590
But you know,
this process takes up to a year.

685
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,730
And I asked that I be able to serve
again in some capacity. Let my, let my,

686
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,790
the specialties that I had that I had
acquired over the years at SRT one,

687
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,830
um,
be put to use in the Pacific.

688
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:05,330
So they deployment to Korea for my last
deployment in the end of 2016 and as

689
00:42:05,331 --> 00:42:08,780
soon as I got home from that, I was,
I was medically retired and, uh,

690
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:10,340
had to find my next mission.
You know,

691
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:14,690
like you talked about the earlier
on in the podcast. I mean, it's,

692
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,770
it life truly is about
mission and, um, you know,

693
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:22,190
I'm getting into politics now running
for Congress and in Houston, Texas, uh,

694
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:26,270
for the second district.
And I talked about this a lot and from a,

695
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,760
from a political philosophy standpoint,

696
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,410
if you don't give people a mission or
you don't encourage people to find their

697
00:42:33,411 --> 00:42:38,160
purpose and their dignity, you,
you have a failing society. Uh,

698
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,620
it's so important and you're
not, you know, even even
think tanks, talk about this,

699
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,940
like American Enterprise Institute,

700
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:48,941
like our policies need to promote a sense
of mission for people and help people

701
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,350
understand that they
have value in this world.

702
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:53,120
They're here on this earth for a reason.

703
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,530
And if you're not constantly seeking out
what that value is that you contribute

704
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:01,800
to society, you're not doing your job and
we need to help you do your job if, if,

705
00:43:01,801 --> 00:43:05,120
if, if need be, but you, but
you do have value and you,

706
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:09,830
and you must find that purpose
in life. Um, and guys like us,

707
00:43:09,831 --> 00:43:14,090
I think can't survive without
that constant mission. And uh,

708
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,700
well we see it all the time with,
with all vets. And when they,

709
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,670
and I talk about this all the time,
the vets that get out,

710
00:43:19,671 --> 00:43:21,290
that have a note on newt,
another mission,

711
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,990
they focused on that mission
and they go kick ass.

712
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,500
The vets that get out and don't
know what they're going to do,

713
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,540
that flounder around without a direction.

714
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,320
Those are the guys that end up in trouble
because they don't have a mission.

715
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:37,220
So they go and drink a beer,
then they have another beer and then the,

716
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,830
they could get prescribed
pain medicine for their back,

717
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:43,100
which hurts which socks and,
and they go down this bad road.

718
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,960
And I believe a lot of it is because, you
know, they just need that next mission.

719
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,240
But you got done with,

720
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:55,350
so 2016 you didn't roll right
into politics. You rolled to you,

721
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,120
you went back to college.
Did that become,

722
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:01,360
doesn't 16 did that become you?

723
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,290
You looked at what you're going
to do next and you said, okay,

724
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:06,530
well how else can I serve?
How well it's going to move forward?

725
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,490
What's my next mission going to be?

726
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:09,940
And you decided you're going to
go back to school, back to school

727
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,550
for, I knew it was going
to stay in public service.

728
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,730
So I knew my next mission was
going to still be government.

729
00:44:15,731 --> 00:44:18,220
I wasn't exactly sure what
I knew I wanted to do.

730
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,700
I wanted to be able to implement
policy and strategy and,

731
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,390
and take that tactical experience.
Um, cause I had to have, you know,

732
00:44:25,391 --> 00:44:29,980
cause I that built an understanding of
what policy in d c looks like on the

733
00:44:29,981 --> 00:44:31,440
ground.
Um,

734
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:36,640
and actually because the reason I was
hurt that day in 2012 was because of an

735
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:38,700
Obama administration's

736
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:44,370
policy of always wanting boots on the
ground battle of damage assessments for

737
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:48,360
any, any close air support. So
because earlier in that day,

738
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:51,060
marines that called in close air support
on a compound they were taking fire

739
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:51,894
from,

740
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,620
for some reason they wanted guys to walk
across minefields and go take pictures

741
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:59,220
of it. Right? That's not good policy.
Now it's not a victim hood story.

742
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:02,550
Don't get me wrong. I mean there was
a battle going on. We want it to go,

743
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:06,950
I don't care really what the reason is,
but from a policy perspective, that's,

744
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:08,950
that's concerning that,
that,

745
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,670
that kind of pressure has being
put on our two star and our,

746
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:16,320
and that's what drove that mission. That
doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Um,

747
00:45:16,321 --> 00:45:19,740
so it's great to see somebody like
General Madison right now who says the

748
00:45:19,741 --> 00:45:22,590
opposite. I will not waste my troops
time with these kinds of things.

749
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:23,850
And he's on record. Um, you know,

750
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:26,430
after we dropped the mother
of all bombs while back,

751
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,880
he's on record saying I will not waste
my troops time going to count the dead

752
00:45:29,881 --> 00:45:33,540
bodies out there. That's just
good policy. So, you know,

753
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:37,580
a wanted to take that
experience to Washington, um,

754
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:41,640
the natural and the national next
step was get the right education.

755
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,850
So the Harvard Kennedy School
of Government is where I went,

756
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,240
got a master's degree in public
administration focusing more on national

757
00:45:48,241 --> 00:45:51,760
security issues, economic
issues, um, and, and,

758
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,080
and a little bit of political us politics.
How long was that school?

759
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,640
I just did a year when your program
and, um, you know, it's kind of the, uh,

760
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,810
accelerated executive style program
that you can apply to if you're,

761
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,780
if you're older and you actually
have some, some life experience,

762
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:10,980
the intensity level of that, uh,
it's tense as you make it. I took,

763
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:15,480
I took about four extra credits
more than I needed to. Uh,

764
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,880
so I was busy cause I, you know, it's,

765
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,610
it's not like going to college
where you're just getting
through it. I think, uh,

766
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,560
I would highly recommend anybody,
you know,

767
00:46:22,561 --> 00:46:24,450
you do a master's degree later on in life,

768
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,390
you're really going to get
the most you can out of it.

769
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,630
You cause you care about learning.

770
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:30,510
You're there for a reason
because you have purpose and,

771
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:34,490
and you know why you're there. So I got
a lot out of it honestly. And it was,

772
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,270
it was quite, it was really
an amazing year. I mean,

773
00:46:36,271 --> 00:46:38,430
you hear from the greatest
people had, you know, bushes,

774
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:42,990
deputy national security advisor
teaching us. Um, I had, uh,

775
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,200
you know, the, the premier experts
on counterproliferation policy, uh,

776
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:52,110
teaching us in classic Reagan's
Chief Economic Advisor is
my economics professor.

777
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:56,790
I mean, you just can't, you know, the,
these people don't speak in terms of like,

778
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:59,010
this is what we think happens in the
White House there. No, they're like,

779
00:46:59,011 --> 00:47:01,350
when I was in the White House,
this is how it got done. I mean,

780
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,100
that's the kind of the, the level
of instruction that you're getting.

781
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:09,780
So it was really happy to, to get
that education. And it, it, it, it's,

782
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:14,400
it truly applies to, as in the hood. My
current role is as running for office.

783
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,680
Um,
I'm glad it was there,

784
00:47:16,681 --> 00:47:19,470
but what I hadn't necessarily thought
about running for office even after I

785
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:23,220
graduated, uh, I was looking at more
policy jobs, you know, cause I didn't,

786
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:24,360
I don't have the political connections.

787
00:47:24,361 --> 00:47:28,220
I don't have the background and money
and the donor networks to really to,

788
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:30,480
to jump on a campaign,
uh,

789
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,810
right away we've thought about it in the
longterm sense, uh, for sure. But, uh,

790
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,380
but not in the short term. And a,
I was working with Pete sessions,

791
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,150
Congressman Pete sessions and
Capitol Hill for a little while,

792
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:44,200
getting legislative experience
there and I'm working,

793
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:47,610
doing some consulting and uh,

794
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:51,610
eventually came to a head where I was
about to take a job that they're doing

795
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:55,990
counter weapons of mass destruction
policy for Department of Defense or go run

796
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:57,640
for office because my congressman,

797
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,230
Ted Poe had just announced
retirement and we prayed about it.

798
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,420
We thought about it. We, uh, had
the right backing from, you know,

799
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:10,510
some well connected people that I think
God just put in front of us at the right

800
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:15,430
time. And my wife and I went for it.
You know, she was, uh, she was all in,

801
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,670
who was all in and, uh, and that
was it. I mean, I've already,

802
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:20,710
I'd already come back to Texas,

803
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,220
but at this point to help with
hurricane Harvey reconstruction was out.

804
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:28,510
Volunteering were my old
hometown of Katie. Um, my
parents didn't flood. They were,

805
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:30,370
they were living there.
They've been living in spring,

806
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,840
which is just north of Katie for the
past 13, 14 years. But, you know,

807
00:48:34,841 --> 00:48:37,770
neighbors needed help. They
were still need help. Um, it's,

808
00:48:37,771 --> 00:48:42,120
it's still pretty devastated in Houston.
And you know,

809
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,130
I think the decision became easy that
we knew this was the right choice.

810
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,270
Like this was the right mission. If I
cared about nuclear proliferation policy,

811
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,100
what better place to affect
it for them from Congress.

812
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,090
If you care about helping flood victims,
no better place than elected office. Um,

813
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,520
if you care about border security,

814
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,790
which Texans do no better place
than public office. You know,

815
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:05,350
if we care about protecting Americans
and protecting the sanctity of the seal

816
00:49:05,351 --> 00:49:10,170
teams and, and pushing the right policies
from the defense level, then you know,

817
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,670
elected politics is
where I can do it from.

818
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:17,230
And so the decision was easy was it was,
it was the right choice for us.

819
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:19,060
We knew we were doing it
for the right reasons.

820
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:22,660
We know we are still doing it for the
right reasons and we're not going to quit.

821
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,820
So with all those things
that you said that are,

822
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,940
are real positive about
having a political career,

823
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,040
yeah.
You must have also been looking at the,

824
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,500
the nightmare gut check,

825
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,150
just mudslinging that you're going to
have to go or that's going to be thrown at

826
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:43,600
you and all that and,

827
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,150
and your family getting a microscope
on him and watched all the time and no

828
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,540
privacy and all that. How did you
weigh those things out and that,

829
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,340
did you think about those things as well?

830
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,100
Absolutely. Uh, it's,

831
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,530
it's by far the most concerning
thing about politics. I
mean, if anything drives,

832
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,400
drives you out, it's, it's
that, you know, and frankly,

833
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:08,360
the experience hasn't been too bad yet.
I mean, I get attacked for silly things,

834
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,770
uh, here and there. I've got a, you
know, one of, one of my opponents,

835
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,100
I what I would call one of his
cronies there. There's these,

836
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,630
there's these corrupt,
um,

837
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:22,520
they called them the slates in Harris
County, which is Harris County is Houston.

838
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:23,893
Um,

839
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:29,500
and these three slates are essentially
three political mailers that go out and

840
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:32,630
they, they make, they target
senior citizens especially,

841
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:35,810
and they make it sound like there's these,
these um,

842
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,230
these conservative review
type of magazines. You know,

843
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:42,920
these something with authority behind it.
But really they're not really,

844
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:47,090
they're pay to play and it's just one
author and they pick who they like based

845
00:50:47,091 --> 00:50:50,150
on what kind of money they were able to
get out of the deal. And then the trash,

846
00:50:50,151 --> 00:50:53,630
everybody else. So, you know, they
put mine, they put my bio on there.

847
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,610
It doesn't say anything
about who I actually am.

848
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:58,070
It just says I'm homeless and don't
have a job and would like to be gone.

849
00:50:58,071 --> 00:51:00,440
I mean it's, it's absurd, right?

850
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:04,310
And most people read it and they think
this is this, this can't be serious.

851
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,181
So it actually,

852
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:08,090
it got me a lot of votes because people
would look me up after that. It's like,

853
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:12,410
oh well this is, this is who this guy is.
Maybe I will vote for him after all. Um,

854
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:16,220
but, but unfortunately that's politics and
that's, that's the world we live in. Um,

855
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,090
even though the,
you know,

856
00:51:17,091 --> 00:51:21,800
the Harris County Republican Party has
publicly denounce these so-called slates,

857
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,100
um, cause they send out these voter guides
and you know, they just announced them.

858
00:51:25,101 --> 00:51:27,320
But people don't always know.
People aren't, you know,

859
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:31,100
sometimes a lot of folks still rely on
those so that you're battling this kind

860
00:51:31,101 --> 00:51:34,460
of corruption. You're battling this
establishment. I mean, you know,

861
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:37,310
we always talk about the establishment
and politics and I never really knew what

862
00:51:37,311 --> 00:51:37,851
that meant.

863
00:51:37,851 --> 00:51:41,900
I think until I stopped behind the curtain
and now I truly understand and it's

864
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:46,901
this class of politically connected
people in the donor class that really just

865
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:51,590
stick together and it has nothing to do
with policy or doing the right thing for

866
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:53,690
the American people.
It's just how much money do you have?

867
00:51:53,691 --> 00:51:57,050
That's all that matters. And it's
not, it's not all that matters. Um,

868
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,130
we made it into the runoff after last
week's election, which is March six.

869
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:06,220
I was nine candidates in my primary and
on and on election day I came out far

870
00:52:06,591 --> 00:52:08,330
and away first place.
Um,

871
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,450
we beat out overall in the election.
I was second place, but we beat out.

872
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:16,220
So just to again,

873
00:52:16,221 --> 00:52:19,660
explain that a little bit for people
that aren't paying attention to the

874
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:22,130
election, you were in the, in the fight,

875
00:52:22,131 --> 00:52:25,790
you're going against nine other
candidates going into the election.

876
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:30,350
Obviously there's some people that vote
early through mail voting and they just

877
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:34,040
vote early and you were behind there.

878
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,420
But then as your campaign picked up and
people started to actually see who you

879
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:43,400
are, when people came to vote on
election day, you, you won election day,

880
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,060
but you didn't win all the votes combined
because the people that had voted

881
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:48,710
early and got it correct.

882
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:52,550
And it shows the trajectory and the
momentum of what you're doing. Right.

883
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,410
We've got some great momentum that
we're excited about and even put in,

884
00:52:56,570 --> 00:52:58,100
he would paint a broader picture.
You know,

885
00:52:58,101 --> 00:53:02,100
we started this late November and
the election was march six. That's,

886
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:05,150
that's a very little time for anybody
to get a campaign together. So,

887
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,370
and we're going up against, um, you know,

888
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,090
one of my opponents had s probably
all ended up spending the,

889
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:13,790
when the numbers come in
between six and $7 million,

890
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:17,440
which is a record for self funding
for a campaign like this. Um,

891
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,930
another opponent in a similar,
similar or very high spending,

892
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,810
very much self funded.
And it was already state representative,

893
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:27,090
so had had some kind of campaign machine
in place. You're trying to catch up,

894
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:32,120
you're trying to build a campaign team
and an an a message within almost no time

895
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:37,170
at all and no money whatsoever.
That's, that's not an easy task.

896
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:38,670
And it only a couple of months.

897
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,500
Usually you start like a year out if
you're going to run for Congress. Um, but,

898
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:43,140
but this,

899
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,520
that just wasn't the case here because a
typo announced retirement and about mid

900
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:51,900
November. So we had a lot to overcome.
Um, we built that momentum quickly.

901
00:53:51,901 --> 00:53:55,420
We worked hard, worked
hard, got the message outs,

902
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,700
met as many people as we could. And
you know, in, uh, worked, uh, we, we,

903
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:03,750
we've snuck by, uh, was snuck out of that
third place spot because as you said,

904
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:07,530
so we were behind during early voting
and mail and voting because that,

905
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:09,180
that stuff happens so early.

906
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:12,840
There was just no way for my momentum to
catch up in time. But by election day,

907
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,860
we were far and away first place and,
uh, were able to sneak into the runoff.

908
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:20,130
So now we're in the runoff
and that's a May 22nd.

909
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:22,910
So we've got another two months to,
uh,

910
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,100
to really prepare and get our
message out there. And I think we're,

911
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,470
we're excited about it and I
think it's going to go well.

912
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:33,800
So you talked about this a little
bit. You talked about money, right?

913
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,750
Money and as disturbing as it is,

914
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:42,670
what's driving so much of who wins these
elections is who has the most money

915
00:54:42,671 --> 00:54:44,800
because that's how you get
the advertising. That's
how you get the mailers.

916
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:46,420
That's how you get the word out there.
I mean,

917
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:50,160
if you don't have the money to pay for
advertising than no one knows you the

918
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,610
yard and you don't get any votes.

919
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:56,380
So as disturbing as that is you
without money, you, you, you,

920
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,960
you have a real hard time.
I mean,

921
00:54:58,961 --> 00:55:01,990
you've done an amazing job with
the limited amount. How, I mean,

922
00:55:01,991 --> 00:55:04,930
how much money did you go into
that last election? Spending

923
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:07,790
ended up spending total about $200,000.

924
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,060
So we were outspent in a 30 over,

925
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:14,340
over 30 to one easily.
I would say.

926
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:17,050
You could say more if you count
what everybody else, you know,

927
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,500
first and second place also spent
against me. I mean, you know,

928
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,460
it's something to be proud of,

929
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,530
but uh,
so I,

930
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:29,460
I think if we can raise $200,000 and you
went up against somebody that spent $6

931
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,570
million sprite and yeah,
like I said,

932
00:55:32,571 --> 00:55:37,430
unfortunately money drives so much of
these elections and that's why you end up

933
00:55:37,431 --> 00:55:40,490
with those people that,
I mean,

934
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:43,430
I know you can't technically or possibly,

935
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:46,970
but you're not supposed to be able
to buy an election. Right, right.

936
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,910
But I mean, the, the,

937
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:53,090
the person that you talked about that
spent 6 million without that money,

938
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,220
I mean we're where wood is a female.
Right?

939
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,660
Where would she have been without
spending that money? I mean,

940
00:55:57,700 --> 00:55:59,820
I'm assuming she wouldn't
have been anywhere. No.

941
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,130
So she was able to by herself
at least third place. Right.

942
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,060
And maybe if she had another more money,

943
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:09,650
she would've been able to buy
herself first place. That's
a scary thought. It is.

944
00:56:09,651 --> 00:56:11,810
I mean, it, you know, I, I, I

945
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,760
don't like the way campaign finance works.

946
00:56:13,761 --> 00:56:18,080
I don't think he should be able to self
fund that much for a race. And you know,

947
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,440
I understand that there's some good
arguments to make that you can sell fund

948
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:27,130
over what the individual limit is.
But, but to that extent, I mean it's,

949
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:31,870
you know, it truly creates a, a donor
class of politicians and like that's just,

950
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:36,220
I don't think that's what we want as
American people and it's, it's up.

951
00:56:36,221 --> 00:56:38,230
But it's up to voters
in the end to decide.

952
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,750
It's up to voters to see through that.
And you know,

953
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:43,220
I always encourage go out and do
your research. You know, just,

954
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,030
just do enough to go on the websites of
each candidate and get a feel for who

955
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:49,240
they are, watched them, watch
their videos, see how they speak,

956
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:53,290
see how they would represent you,
see how they would articulate your values.

957
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:55,690
You know,
we put up youtube videos all the time.

958
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:58,440
You can always wash me and
interviews. Um, you know, we're,

959
00:56:58,441 --> 00:57:00,730
we're coming to or listen to podcasts,

960
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,180
listen to Jockos podcasts and uh,
you know,

961
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:07,660
cause cause you want people to get to
know you and you need to be out there with

962
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:11,410
folks. You need to be meeting people
everywhere you go. And that's how we won.

963
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,800
You know, that's how we built
that connection with the voter.

964
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:16,390
That's how we built momentum.

965
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:20,320
Just getting out and meeting people and
inspiring them to connecting with them.

966
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,450
That's, that's, that's still works.

967
00:57:22,451 --> 00:57:26,080
And we proved that that's one of the
things that you did while your opponents,

968
00:57:26,081 --> 00:57:29,460
we're spending a bunch of money
you put on your running shoes yeah.

969
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:32,710
And ran through your entire district.
Right.

970
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,680
I did lift a lot of the way to cause uh,

971
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:40,660
we talked about overpreparing well
sometimes you can under prepare and a,

972
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:43,690
when you're running a campaign there's
not a lot of time to get your running in.

973
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,740
And so I started at a hundred mile
run and um, it was going well.

974
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:51,010
And so I want to back up a little
bit. We, we planned this awhile out.

975
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,070
It was going to be five days
run across the whole district.

976
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:57,010
Really show that dedication. I want
to, I want to get on the ground.

977
00:57:57,011 --> 00:58:00,840
I want to show the dedication to every
inch of this district and I'm with,

978
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,590
with whatever publicity we get out of it,

979
00:58:02,591 --> 00:58:05,420
we're going to use it for a good cause
and we, we set up a go fund me account.

980
00:58:05,421 --> 00:58:07,120
It's still active if you
want to donate to it,

981
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:12,390
let's go fund me.com/rebuild Houston
with Dan Crenshaw and that money goes to

982
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:17,650
three particular volunteer groups that
I was able to identify and vet that are

983
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:20,430
still out there everyday
rebuilding people's homes. Is that,

984
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:21,700
I mean that is still going on.

985
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:23,800
I always try to let everybody
know if you're a contractor,

986
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:26,650
if you've got any expertise,
please come volunteer in Houston.

987
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,070
We are backed up into, you know, it is,

988
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,300
it is tough to find a
contractor these days.

989
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:33,160
Even if people have the
money to pay for it,

990
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,080
they still can't get any availability.

991
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:38,320
The demand is so high that the prices
have gone way through the roof.

992
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:42,640
We need more people. They're nationwide.
So, you know, police come to Houston,

993
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:45,460
there's work for you and
there's good work. Um,

994
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,170
and there's a lot left to
do when people need it.

995
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,510
So in these volunteer groups are
out doing it, you know, for five,

996
00:58:49,511 --> 00:58:52,960
$7,000 between five and $7,000,

997
00:58:52,961 --> 00:58:55,350
they can rebuild a whole home
because all their labors free, right.

998
00:58:55,351 --> 00:58:58,360
It's volunteers and they may do a great
job and they're working in a lot of

999
00:58:58,361 --> 00:59:01,720
these neighborhoods where we're
individuals just can't do it themselves.

1000
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,583
And it was,
it was,

1001
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:06,940
it was just great to see that a lot of
church affiliated groups always out there

1002
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:09,040
helping and um,
you know,

1003
00:59:09,041 --> 00:59:11,800
it makes you proud to be a tax and
it makes you proud to be an American.

1004
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,380
So we finished that run,
you know,

1005
00:59:14,381 --> 00:59:17,650
by by day three I was certainly
limping through most of it. Um,

1006
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:21,890
it changed out my shoes day five or
we're running pretty well again, but um,

1007
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,400
it was tough, but it was, it was fun.
It was great. It was a great experience.

1008
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,370
You see people honking at you
maybe because you're in their way.

1009
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:33,110
Maybe because maybe because they're
supporting you. I don't know, but, uh,

1010
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,790
I mean it was just,
it was,

1011
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:39,590
it was pretty credible experienced to
see the supporters out there to see just,

1012
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,000
you know, it was, it was great.
Um, we went and that was,

1013
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:48,770
that was one early voting started. It was
a, we voted on day one of that run. And,

1014
00:59:48,771 --> 00:59:52,390
uh, and, and, and, and, you know,
two weeks later on election day,

1015
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,430
we wrapped it up and it was,
it was a good night. It was a,

1016
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:56,750
we're on pins and needles.

1017
00:59:56,751 --> 01:00:00,110
It wasn't until 2:00 AM that we knew
that we'd actually come that come into

1018
01:00:00,111 --> 01:00:02,900
second place by 155 boats.
Oh,

1019
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,550
so you think anybody says
their vote doesn't count,
doesn't matter. That's wrong.

1020
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,390
It, it truly matters. I mean,
every single vote mattered.

1021
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,750
I can't thank every volunteer enough.
Can't think every supporter enough.

1022
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,990
Cause a lot of people went out and
they maybe got 10 votes here and there,

1023
01:00:17,991 --> 01:00:19,870
maybe a hundred votes here and there.
You know,

1024
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,900
individuals were able to do that and put
us over the top because they believed

1025
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:27,330
in the message they believed in our
candidacy. And it was just, you know,

1026
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,330
it's humbling. It's, it's almost,

1027
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:32,900
you feel a weight of responsibility when
people put their trust in you like that

1028
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,990
as you should feel it because you don't
want to disappoint them and they know

1029
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:39,020
you.
You can't let your supporters down.

1030
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:44,000
And I truly feel that way about every
vote. So what's so what's next right now?

1031
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:47,400
Well, it's the runoff, the runoff.

1032
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:51,860
It's just me and Kevin Roberts
and I'm just, you know,

1033
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,400
it's May 22nd early voting starts
again a couple of weeks before that.

1034
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,460
And it's a lot of the same, you
know, we, we, we stick to the basics.

1035
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:02,090
We professionalize our organization.
Uh, we asked for more money.

1036
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:06,900
Please donate a Crenshaw for converse.com
and at noon. And we, and we, we,

1037
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,380
that's actually real
though. Like you, you Kinda,

1038
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,170
you Kinda joke about it
and I know you're like,

1039
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,750
like most good human beings,

1040
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,540
you feel uncomfortable saying,
hey, give me some money.

1041
01:01:17,541 --> 01:01:22,430
But the reality is for you to take
this to the next level that you need,

1042
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:26,180
you need money. And, and so when
you say that kind of jokingly,

1043
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:28,280
the reality is if you
don't get that money,

1044
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,280
it's going to be really hard to
swing it upset. Right. And so,

1045
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,010
so that's what's the,
what's the website?

1046
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,400
It's Crenshaw for congress.com c r e n
s h a w for congress.com you can donate

1047
01:01:40,461 --> 01:01:42,830
there. You can check out the
canyon to see there. You know,

1048
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,820
see our interviews here, youtube videos
or commercials, my bio, everything.

1049
01:01:46,821 --> 01:01:49,460
It's all in one spot.
Follow us on Facebook.

1050
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:51,890
We've got a pretty exciting
social media presence.

1051
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:55,460
That's how we get a lot of our word out
because you know it's cheap and it hits

1052
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:59,390
the right people. So Crenshaw for
congress.com and you know that money,

1053
01:01:59,391 --> 01:02:03,700
we spend it wisely. It doesn't
go to anything silly. It's,
you know, we need it to,

1054
01:02:03,730 --> 01:02:07,160
to send mail to, to, to voters.
You know, to get our message out.

1055
01:02:07,161 --> 01:02:08,600
We needed to put out radio ads,

1056
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:12,590
we needed to buy tee shirts for volunteers
and to buy yard signs so that people

1057
01:02:12,591 --> 01:02:16,250
can put them in their yards and
create that upwelling of support, uh,

1058
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:20,040
where everybody's got to Dan Crenshaw
sign that. That's, that's how we

1059
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:24,030
do it. And, um, it's, it's, but
it's, we work our butts off,

1060
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:28,590
I promise you that we work for, we work
for every vote out there and I'm, I,

1061
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:32,820
I truly believe that's how it should be.
Um, and that's how it'd be in Congress.

1062
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:37,080
Yeah. That's awesome. And I
know you're on a kind of a,

1063
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:40,290
a time schedule today and I know you've
got some other things that you want to

1064
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:44,310
do here while you're out here in sunny,

1065
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:47,160
Sunny San Diego,
which isn't too sunny today,

1066
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:52,550
but I think we just hit everything of
how people can best support your cause.

1067
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:58,160
And obviously I'm in Crenshaw
for Congress on Twitter.

1068
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,390
You're Dan Crenshaw, Texas, TX, correct.

1069
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:06,990
So at Dan [inaudible], Crenshaw, TX,

1070
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,100
and then on Facebook it's pretty easy
to find you is just Dan Crenshaw,

1071
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,180
Crenshaw for Congress at Crenshaw
for Congress. It's pretty easy. Yeah,

1072
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:19,380
I just searched Dan crunch on
you. Pop right up. So that's a,

1073
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:24,420
that's it. Well, you know, obviously I
just want to say before you take off,

1074
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,110
thanks for your service.
Thanks for thanks for your sacrifice,

1075
01:03:28,111 --> 01:03:29,820
for this great country.

1076
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:34,821
Thank for what you've done for what you're
doing and thank you for what you are

1077
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:38,850
going to do and appreciate everything.

1078
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:43,260
I appreciate that Jocko, you
know, the search services
and over, um, you know, we,

1079
01:03:43,261 --> 01:03:47,940
we find our purpose, we find
our new mission and this is
it for me. You know, it's,

1080
01:03:47,941 --> 01:03:49,230
it's helping Texans,
it's given.

1081
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:52,110
Texans are representative I
think they can be proud of.

1082
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,970
We are so often just disgruntled and
ashamed of our politicians and we don't

1083
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:01,200
really think they're working on our
behalf because we don't always let people

1084
01:04:01,201 --> 01:04:04,820
who truly put service before self and,
and you know,

1085
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:10,160
part of this campaign is it's convincing
those that we do have a future and we

1086
01:04:10,271 --> 01:04:15,271
do have a future of leaders that will
attract people to conservative values and

1087
01:04:15,451 --> 01:04:18,370
um, and, and keep those
values alive and, and,

1088
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,870
and again give us a leader that
we can be proud of. Awesome.

1089
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:25,950
Well I think they'll definitely find
that with you. Thanks for coming on.

1090
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,910
And it's an honor to be
here until you come back on.

1091
01:04:29,970 --> 01:04:31,170
Once you get the w,

1092
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:35,430
once you get the wind come back on and
you can explain to us where you're going

1093
01:04:35,431 --> 01:04:37,590
from there. Absolutely.
Tell you how we did it.

1094
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,880
Get Out and vote May 22nd
everybody. Thanks Dan. Thanks
for coming on. Thank you.

1095
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,040
So Dan has left the studio,

1096
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,910
but he's also left some very good ways
to support him and what he's doing.

1097
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,970
And
Echo Charles.

1098
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,850
Speaking of support.
Yeah.

1099
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:05,930
Maybe you could tell the troops how
they can support this cause sure.

1100
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,750
If they want, if the
course, if they want and,

1101
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:15,140
and while they're supporting this
cost also support the to themselves,

1102
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:18,070
which is important. Tiffts if they
want, you know, did you hear what I just

1103
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:22,210
said? Yeah. Very important.
I said important. Yeah.
You said it correct. Yeah.

1104
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:26,740
Two t's in that one for sure. Normally
there's no t's in it for me. Yeah. Yeah.

1105
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,620
Important.
Kind of like the British accent.

1106
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:32,860
Sometimes they don't say the [inaudible]
and sometimes the same, really solid,

1107
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:33,753
you know,

1108
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:39,240
like they say snap back to reality e they
don't say the reality or reality and I

1109
01:05:42,941 --> 01:05:47,650
see it nonetheless. Back due support.
Yeah. If you want to support,

1110
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:49,000
support your joints.

1111
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,200
Okay.

1112
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,690
This is how you support your joints. If
you didn't already. Jock was supplements,

01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:20,410
enhancer force multiplier.
Wholesome Force multiplier. Yeah.

1118
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:25,320
There's layers. Yeah. Actually, yeah. It's
like a blend. It's a good blend. Yeah,

1119
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:27,860
I am running low on the Krill oil.

1120
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:32,480
I did not take my own advice for the
the restrictions subscription. Yeah.

1121
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:37,510
So I had to manually get some more,
but hey man, that's life sometimes. Uh,

1122
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:40,520
if you want to get on
the subscription thing

1123
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,900
re up every, what is it month, right?
Cause it's a month supply. Yeah. Yeah.

1124
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:48,630
However much you take and
that's the smart way to do it.

1125
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:52,470
Totally is joint warfare to did you
mentioned drone warfare? Yeah, fully.

1126
01:06:52,950 --> 01:06:55,800
It's the one, I think the Combo
is the best way to go. For sure.

1127
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:59,610
Recommend the Combo. Nonetheless,
you get them@originmain.com.

1128
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:02,640
Good way to support and support yourself.
That's a big one.

1129
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,320
also@originmain.com they're Giza and
rash guards for you. You Jitsu journey.

1130
01:07:08,310 --> 01:07:13,310
If you have chosen or will choose
to go on that Jujitsu journey,

1131
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:14,430
there's no reason why not.

1132
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,500
You should go on the Jujitsu and if
you're going to ask, what if I'm small,

1133
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,380
big, large, overweight or
your older, younger, young.

1134
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:29,070
The answer is start Jujitsu. Yeah. How'd
you get in shape for Jujitsu? Jujitsu.

1135
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:33,390
Yeah. That's what you do. Yeah. You
know, Tim, Tim always says like, Oh,

1136
01:07:33,391 --> 01:07:36,310
you know how t he's been out
of the Jujitsu for a long
item forward. Yeah. Yeah.

1137
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:41,390
And he'll be like, Whoa, I gotta
get back in shape to go. No,

1138
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:45,040
you're looking at the wrong layman.
Oh yeah. You go back to Jujitsu,

1139
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:48,500
the Gds to get you in shape. You'll
be, you'll be fine going to me, shit,

1140
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:52,530
you can suffer a little bit, but might
even suffered a lot and probably a lot.

1141
01:07:52,531 --> 01:07:57,531
It's hard to gotta be hard mentally for
a guy like Timbo because he's a purple

1142
01:07:58,021 --> 01:08:01,260
belt. Yeah. And so he's going to come
and get beat by some white belts. I mean,

1143
01:08:01,261 --> 01:08:03,000
not wipe outs by some blue belts.
Yeah.

1144
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,660
Cause you know some blue
belts and they bring it. Yeah.

1145
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,490
And the key and they
can keep bringing it up.

1146
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,000
They been in there because it got the
Kadesh. Yeah. Yes. Tim would be like,

1147
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:15,980
come back in then. And it adds that
level anxiety because you know,

1148
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:18,100
when you feel yourself gallon,
well you probably don't know this boat.

1149
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,700
If you feel yourself
gassing and you're like,

1150
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:22,340
should I knew I was going to gas now
you're really gassy and now is the anxiety

1151
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:26,060
goes up and yes, some more. There's a how
it is. He'd want to avoid all that stuff.

1152
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:27,830
That's what I think.
But you know,

1153
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:30,830
that's when you put all
these weird expectations and
yourself. That's my opinion.

1154
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:34,760
And the Jujitsu. So just go into Jujitsu
and learn Jujitsu. And when you do,

1155
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:39,170
you're going to want a Ge if you do
geek cause he can do no g as well.

1156
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,800
But when you choose a g I
recommend you recommend.

1157
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,580
I think there's only one recommendation.
I agree. In all seriousness,

1158
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,270
there's only one recommendation. Yeah.
And I've been through a lot of geese.

1159
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,190
I have a lot of key experience.

1160
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,210
We'll see a significant amount
of gay experience and the origin.

1161
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:03,840
He has proven legitimately to be the
best one. Kind of by far too. Yeah.

1162
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:06,130
There's this one that I used to use it to.

1163
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:11,150
Dell's good was fine and it was like
good. Yeah. There's a difference though,

1164
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:13,690
when there's a difference
between this skis. Good. Yeah.

1165
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,940
And then you get an orange and gay. Yeah.
Right. Yeah. You know, it's funny like,

1166
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:19,940
you know how like when you get a new ghee
and rash guard or whatever and you're

1167
01:09:19,941 --> 01:09:23,450
kind of fired up and go train because
you got your new gay, you know,

1168
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,240
it's that faster.

1169
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:28,610
That feeling didn't wear
off like for a while.

1170
01:09:28,611 --> 01:09:33,260
Did you feel that like when we rolled,
when we were both wearing you origins?

1171
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:35,600
I did. Where are you fired up?
Yeah. Yeah. Cause like, yeah.

1172
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:39,830
Did you think maybe it was
going to be the day? Uh,

1173
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:45,550
for the record, I always think it's
going to be the day. Always. Yeah. Dang.

1174
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,260
Because maybe one day there will be that
they just think it's going to be the

1175
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:50,540
day to, maybe it's not though.
Maybe it will. I don't know.

1176
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:54,020
Could be the day she anyway,

1177
01:09:55,370 --> 01:09:59,000
origin main.com get your g there
when you choose to get a g,

1178
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,640
there's compression gear too.
Rash guards. If you do know, gee,

1179
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:04,140
there's rash guards there too.
All made in America. Yeah.

1180
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:07,760
I was gonna say all made in America,
which is like, it's no big deal. No,

1181
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:10,490
it's a huge deal.
It's a huge deal made in America,

1182
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,780
in Maine and our factory
by awesome workers.

1183
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:19,850
And it's not the kind where by crafts
cross people, crafts, craftsmen,

1184
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:24,170
crafts person, crafts people. Cause
people, man, there are more females. Yeah.

1185
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:28,730
But they're craftsmen. Yeah. Men doesn't
mean you're a man. It means you're human.

1186
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,080
Yeah. As far as I know, like modern man,

1187
01:10:33,081 --> 01:10:36,200
like mankind, mankind. Yeah.
Yeah. There you go. So,

1188
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:41,240
so crossman kind of craftsmen kind
nonetheless. All made in America. Yes.

1189
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:44,690
And that is a big deal. And it's
not the kind where it's like, yeah,

1190
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:48,800
let's import all our things or whatever,
and then we'll quote on quote,

1191
01:10:48,801 --> 01:10:51,980
make it in America where you tick the
one checkbox that it's like, yeah,

1192
01:10:51,981 --> 01:10:53,760
technically it's made it,
it's not that kind.

1193
01:10:54,650 --> 01:10:58,340
It's the kind where they grow
the continent in America, they,

1194
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,900
what do they do after they grow the
content and the harvest? The harvest,

1195
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:05,880
the cotton. They, well, they could die the
cotton and they weave the cotton. Yeah.

1196
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:10,180
Yeah. There's a whole bunch of steps all
done in America. The land of the cotton,

1197
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:12,800
because it's not just cotton.
It's an athletic,

1198
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:16,920
that's one of the problems with the old
geese is they're all made just with,

1199
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:20,760
with cotton. They're
like, like crap. Yeah.

1200
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:24,240
And then why would you not get
modern technology? Well why?

1201
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:28,290
Because they don't have, they don't do
Jujitsu where they're making the geese.

1202
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:31,740
Yeah. Now, so like little
issues that come up in you,

1203
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,750
just little ones or big ones or whatever.

1204
01:11:33,751 --> 01:11:35,520
When they come up to
what's going on and put it,

1205
01:11:35,521 --> 01:11:40,350
you put an origin g in the
dryer it's dry like quick. Yeah.

1206
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:45,630
And because it's not all cotton. Yeah.
Cause if you remember in the teams,

1207
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,730
cotton kills.
Sure.

1208
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:52,680
Cotton Kilz because it gets wet and then
it's heavy and makes you cold jams you

1209
01:11:52,681 --> 01:11:57,320
up. Yeah. It doesn't dry quick
enough. Get the blend going. Yeah.

1210
01:11:57,630 --> 01:12:00,090
Then you're good to go. And there's
all kinds of different leaves too,

1211
01:12:00,091 --> 01:12:01,560
which is cool.
Now let's go to,

1212
01:12:01,561 --> 01:12:04,080
or did you mean.com you can check
out with whichever one you want. Hey,

1213
01:12:04,081 --> 01:12:05,520
if you want something,
get something.

1214
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:11,030
Also what you want to do is go to
the immersion camp if you want.

1215
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:19,050
So did you see any emerging camp? It's
not like a training camp for ADCC. No.

1216
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,440
It's an educational experience.

1217
01:12:21,441 --> 01:12:26,441
Like you immerse yourself in that you can
modulate to the level of your personal

1218
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:33,140
commitment to getting after it.
Yes.

1219
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,350
So some people will be there and they're
going to be really sore every day.

1220
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:40,860
You're gonna be getting after it hard.
Some people are going to be brain,

1221
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,680
their brains going to be some more sore
than their body because they're going to

1222
01:12:43,681 --> 01:12:47,550
be more looking at it from the education
that they're getting of learning new

1223
01:12:47,551 --> 01:12:51,090
moves and techniques.
So that's what's cool about the,

1224
01:12:51,160 --> 01:12:53,220
the immersion camp or some of us,

1225
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:57,210
nothing's going to be sore because maybe
it'll be sore for a little while and

1226
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,520
then we're just going to cruise a
little bit of exercise, the brain more,

1227
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:02,430
and then the button he has to go back
and forth, do whatever you like. Yeah.

1228
01:13:02,431 --> 01:13:05,730
And there's a lot to go on and it's
kind of fun too. That's the thing. Yeah.

1229
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:08,130
What's cool to hang out with just a bunch
of people that are going to do Jitsu

1230
01:13:08,131 --> 01:13:10,380
for seven days.
Yeah.

1231
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,230
And then then they get
like five tons of lobster.

1232
01:13:13,231 --> 01:13:16,080
You don't have to stay there the whole
time. Yeah. There's a, there's a,

1233
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:18,300
there's a first part in a second part,
you know,

1234
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:22,890
it's like the first few days and then
you can do this the second few days and

1235
01:13:22,891 --> 01:13:27,270
then you can do all of them if you want.
So August 26 through September 2nd,

1236
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:31,260
we're going to be there. You know who
else is going? No big deal. Dave Berg.

1237
01:13:32,890 --> 01:13:36,480
Dave Berg got the bug. Oh yeah,
no, he's got the bug. Yeah,

1238
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:40,890
he'll call me for just like verbally,
like, so he's db texted me about, uh,

1239
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:44,700
about like guard passing.
I'm like, Oh really?

1240
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,340
Hey, let's do it. Let's communicate
about guard passing that via text.

1241
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:51,893
Amen.

1242
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:56,400
People with Americana and it's good.

1243
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:59,460
It's an interesting conversation
because, you know, he says,

1244
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:03,570
oh well the American is like what
I use the most right now. And,

1245
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:08,100
and I told them like, the
American is actually not a
really effective move, right.

1246
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,250
Against anyone that has trained for
a little bit. Right. Purple Belt,

1247
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,510
you're not going to,
you might catch an him,

1248
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:16,630
a blue belt in and Americana and purple
belt. Probably not going to happen.

1249
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:20,370
I did catch a black belt in
America under the other day and,

1250
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:23,250
and it was like shame.
Yeah.

1251
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:25,890
I got caught with the Americans in this,

1252
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:30,100
this particular black belt was like shame.
He hung his head in shame. He was like,

1253
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:31,690
you need to go South America Honda.

1254
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,320
But I explained to Dave the,

1255
01:14:35,321 --> 01:14:39,730
the reason that the Americana is effective
for him right now, the most effective.

1256
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:43,180
I'm like, is it the first submission
that you learned? Yes, it is.

1257
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:47,770
So he's practiced at the most than he's
figured out all the little nuance things

1258
01:14:47,771 --> 01:14:52,210
that you have to do right in
order to make the move, a move,

1259
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:54,100
work and the American work.

1260
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:57,670
So he's figured out some of those
things cause he's tried it a bunch.

1261
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,100
Even when he missed it,
he learned something.

1262
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:02,200
You didn't even know he learned something,
but he learned something.

1263
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:06,170
So he keeps trying and
he got good with me.

1264
01:15:06,171 --> 01:15:07,520
So He's good at the Americana.
Yup.

1265
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,790
He's not going against people
that know how to defend a yet,

1266
01:15:09,820 --> 01:15:13,950
which is going to be a problematic.
So you got it. You got to,

1267
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,470
that's what happens. Isn't that part
of the whole learning process though?

1268
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:20,160
Cause yes. Same thing.
I mean remember when a,

1269
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:22,500
I mean I'm assuming you had
similar experience where yeah,

1270
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:27,460
you sure you do Americanos and you'd
get them certain moves for years like,

1271
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:32,380
like, like for when I first started,
my first good move was the keel.

1272
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:37,330
In fact, I used to call it the easy
kill, the easy keeled, easy kill.

1273
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:39,730
That's what I thought it was.
That was wonderful. It was,

1274
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:43,000
I learned it like one of
the first submissions I look
and then I just tried it

1275
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:44,500
all the time and I got pretty good at it.

1276
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:46,660
But then you realize that it's
not that hard to defend the Zeke.

1277
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:48,190
You'll eventually,
when you start going to get better guys.

1278
01:15:48,191 --> 01:15:49,210
So then you got to move to the,

1279
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:51,960
I think the next move that I
actually started doing a lot of that,

1280
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:55,450
the camera and I spent a couple of years
at com era and then I still spend a

1281
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,283
couple of years at crucifix.

1282
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,870
Then I spent a couple of years at the
straight foot lock than it, you know,

1283
01:15:58,871 --> 01:16:03,850
so and alluded to those positions.
That's how,

1284
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:07,540
but Dave Burke, back to
my point, he's coming,

1285
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,680
he's coming to the camp and you
know who else is? I will see you.

1286
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:14,420
I'll just get a call.
We'll see if we'll see if Lafe yeah,

1287
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:18,880
hopefully you know we all have to work.
Sure. Yeah. We block this off though.

1288
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:24,430
Just sweet. That's really good fun.
Yeah. Cool. Go Man. If he can make that,

1289
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:26,940
make that, uh, what's
the date on them again?

1290
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,980
August 26 through September 2nd oh yeah.
And if you want it,

1291
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:30,843
if you do want to come,

1292
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:33,820
you can go to origin main.com and you
go to emerging camp and you can sign up.

1293
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,870
You can come and hang out. Eat lobster
if you like lobster state steak. Yeah.

1294
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:45,550
Hang out in Maine, visit our
factory, you know, which is awesome.

1295
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,950
I think you can go like paddling, stand
up, stand up paddle boarding and stuff.

1296
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:56,050
All kinds of stuff. Yeah. Also
good way to support yourself.

1297
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:59,290
If you choose to vary up your workup,

1298
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:01,180
make it a little less boring.

1299
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:05,340
You always make it sound like I do these
boring workouts and I just realize I've

1300
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:10,070
been taking that abuse for for quite some
time. My workouts are not boring. Well

1301
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:14,810
yeah, in fact they're boring and hard,
so they're hard. Here's the thing where,

1302
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:19,070
well, boring is like just a complete
matter of opinion, you know?

1303
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:24,740
So to me,
if you're going to do 20 rep squats,

1304
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:29,660
Bra breast, 20 reps, rest
20 reps until you're like,

1305
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,040
that's kind of boring.
And have you ever done it before?

1306
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:39,320
Yes. You've done that work
your exact one. But yeah,

1307
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:43,290
I did do 20 rep squat,
some in fact don't.

1308
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:45,920
20 rep squats that you
can only squat 10 times.

1309
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,940
Well that's physically impossible,
but you know, yes it is.

1310
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:51,870
If you could only do it 10 times,
you can only do it 10 times.

1311
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:55,130
You can do it 20 times. You can
do it 20 times. No, that's it.

1312
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:58,880
That's not how it works. I bet.
Hey, look, take my word for it.

1313
01:17:58,881 --> 01:18:02,300
You can physically do it 10 times.
Mentally, you do it 20 times.

1314
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,880
Imagine you do the 20th okay.
It's a look.

1315
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:10,430
You can physically do it 10 times.
I guess.

1316
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,120
Technically you're right, and I don't want
to listen. I don't want to split hairs,

1317
01:18:14,121 --> 01:18:18,200
but you're still not right. If you can do
it 10 times, but you can do it 20 times,

1318
01:18:18,201 --> 01:18:21,260
because look, if you can do something 20
times, you can do it 10 times. So yes,

1319
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:26,350
but what you're seeing is something that
you max out at 10 times the weight you

1320
01:18:26,781 --> 01:18:30,350
use to Max out at 10 times.
You do it 20 times physically impossible.

1321
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:36,210
10 Moscow apparently for
Echo. Oh Man. See, anyway,

1322
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:40,610
back to the workout.
Maybe that's where them skinny me calm

1323
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:50,510
maybe. Anyway, if you want
to vary up the workout,

1324
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:54,260
go to audit dotcom. Slash Jocko.
Get some cool kettlebells. Yeah,

1325
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:58,510
get some battle ropes.
Get a mace, get to Macy's,

1326
01:18:58,550 --> 01:19:02,840
a heavier one and a lighter one. Boom,
formulate a more end and I use them so my,

1327
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:06,740
my workouts are interesting.
All right, well there you go.

1328
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,560
You have any interesting workout.
We'll do it that way. That's what I,

1329
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,490
that's what I would would, what
do you say? Suggest. Okay. Anyway,

1330
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:16,100
dot com good stuff in there.

1331
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,490
Don't get addicted to the website because
there's a lot of good information too

1332
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:24,491
on there cause you could nonetheless
also good way to support when you get the

1333
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:31,241
books that Jocko sometimes reviews on
this podcast I organized or we organize

1334
01:19:31,561 --> 01:19:34,400
them on Jocko podcast.com and click
on the top to the books from the,

1335
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:39,200
from the episode I got
all the books listed there
including little articles that

1336
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:43,400
you know how sometimes you'll cover
article. I'll list those on there.

1337
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:48,530
How much research would you have to do
if you knew nothing about this podcast or

1338
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:52,730
me? How much research would you
have to do to figure out that

1339
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:59,230
we read books on the podcast and that
they're all on Jocko podcast.com the

1340
01:20:01,011 --> 01:20:03,920
reason I ask this is because I've had,

1341
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:08,580
I've had people ask me on social media
like a week ago, like on Twitter,

1342
01:20:08,581 --> 01:20:13,080
like do you like to read? Yeah. Right.

1343
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:17,850
Like that's a cre. You don't have to
dig very deep to, to know that answer.

1344
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:21,590
Yeah. Right. Do you like to read, right?

1345
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:26,720
That this is a really low level question
that doesn't take a whole lot of

1346
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:30,200
research to figure out, right? Yeah.

1347
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:34,230
I guess is that laziness or is it like,
Hey,

1348
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:36,480
this guy seems pretty accessible.
I'm just gonna ask him areas.

1349
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,740
I wonder if this guy likes to read.

1350
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:41,610
I don't think the likelihood of it being
laziness cause I'm just going to be

1351
01:20:41,611 --> 01:20:43,300
different for different people,
but thought the,

1352
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,200
the likelihood of it being
laziness is pretty low I think.

1353
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:48,000
I don't think it's lazy laziness at all.

1354
01:20:48,150 --> 01:20:52,530
I think it would be a mix
or one of these things.

1355
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,920
Yeah.
They just want to ask you a question that,

1356
01:20:55,950 --> 01:21:00,180
that you know that you're
going to have an answer to or,

1357
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:05,720
or maybe they're just new or maybe they
know you from extreme ownership and you

1358
01:21:05,971 --> 01:21:07,920
know, I know you wrote
this cool book, Hey,

1359
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:09,750
do you like to read in
general kind of thing.

1360
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:14,190
Maybe they don't listen to the being
harsh, being too judgmental on my part.

1361
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:14,700
If you're,

1362
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:19,590
if you're jumping to that conclusion
that it's laziness tend to read.

1363
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:25,110
Like we literally have a podcast
about books that we read and,

1364
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:29,160
and then people say, do you have
a list of books? Do you rec?

1365
01:21:29,161 --> 01:21:33,090
Do you have any books you recommend?
Yeah. Do you have a book list?

1366
01:21:33,450 --> 01:21:36,900
Do you have a reading list? These are all
things I could ask on a regular basis.

1367
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:41,520
Is, is this kind of like the time I asked
you, Hey, do you know of any gun ranges?

1368
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:45,810
I said, yeah, Google, go on Google
and search done. Re kind of like that.

1369
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:50,890
So yeah, I feel the same tone. Here's
the thing, you never know really know,

1370
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:54,120
uh, when people were coming into the
game, you didn't know what, you know,

1371
01:21:54,121 --> 01:21:57,840
what their deal is or where they're
coming from. So yeah, like maybe,

1372
01:21:57,841 --> 01:22:02,250
or maybe maybe they just heard you on
Tim Ferriss or Joe Rogan and was like,

1373
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,840
boom, this guy, super interesting.

1374
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:06,870
Let me go straight to them and start
talking to them kind of thing or start

1375
01:22:06,871 --> 01:22:09,960
asking questions rather
than going on the Internet.

1376
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:13,290
Let me research who this guy is and
what he likes and doesn't like to do,

1377
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:14,310
et Cetera, et cetera. Am I,

1378
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:18,990
am I lazy in the fact that when I want
to know something, I'll Google it?

1379
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:23,850
No, that's not lazy. I don't
know. I don't think so.

1380
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:28,050
All right.
As opposed to what I dunno.

1381
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:32,830
Saying going to school and
studying at first, you know,

1382
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,490
alternative nonetheless,

1383
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:39,570
if you were feeling not lazy,

1384
01:22:40,050 --> 01:22:43,500
actually this has nothing
to do with laziness because
this is more a convenience

1385
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:47,700
that I think would be benefit or I thought
it would be beneficial for people who

1386
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:50,430
are looking for the books that
you cover and ways to get them.

1387
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,990
That's why organize these books on, talk
about gas.com the website are all there.

1388
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,130
They're all there by episode and by
chance they're kind of in order of

1389
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:02,220
preference in order of the way you,
almost the way you should read them.

1390
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,950
Maybe I'd have to shift some of them now.
Yeah.

1391
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:08,020
Put them in a different order because
there's some books that I read again.

1392
01:23:08,021 --> 01:23:10,090
I was like, man, this should
be, this should be near the top.

1393
01:23:10,091 --> 01:23:12,620
I mean about faces as the number
is a number one. Yeah, right.

1394
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:16,310
You should read that book
first. Yeah. People ask me
that all the time. Well, what,

1395
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,790
what's your favorite,
I've already read extreme ownership.

1396
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:23,050
Is there another book you recommend I
read? Well, and I've read all your books.

1397
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:26,650
What books should I read next about
face by Colonel David Hackworth.

1398
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:33,280
Yeah. So anyways. Yeah, makes sense.
I mean, I organized them by episode.

1399
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:38,080
Yeah, most recent episode. Right, with
book. But if you go back to episode one,

1400
01:23:38,081 --> 01:23:39,730
which there's no book,
but two, there's a book,

1401
01:23:39,731 --> 01:23:41,260
and if you go in that order of reading,

1402
01:23:41,261 --> 01:23:45,780
that's a good progression to get rid
your books properly. Gotcha. So if you,

1403
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,580
if you, if you want to read your book
Jockos Book list in order of importance,

1404
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:55,210
order importance, you go in
chronological order per pod cast. Yes.

1405
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,740
With books that's recommend not all
podcast. That's recommended. Cool.

1406
01:23:59,770 --> 01:24:03,070
Well there it is again. Just click on the
books and boom, it takes you there. Boom.

1407
01:24:03,550 --> 01:24:08,100
Click through there. Get your book.
Easy way to good way to support.

1408
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,080
Takes it to Amazon. All good. Continue
shopping if you feel the need to,

1409
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:14,320
like if you're shopping for Vat
Ellington's Day. Now that already passed.

1410
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:19,720
What's the next one? Easter.
Hmm? Carry on Easter gifts.

1411
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:24,270
Sure. Good. Those chocolate Easter
bunnies in the, and the eggs. You know,

1412
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:29,560
you go Easter egg hunting, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well my kids do.

1413
01:24:29,650 --> 01:24:33,840
Sure. Well, my youngest kid
does. Yeah, there you go. My,

1414
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:37,360
you can shop for that compare. Yeah. Yeah,
it makes sense. You know, they're older.

1415
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:41,470
After a while, you kind of figure
it out. Kind of still fun though,

1416
01:24:41,471 --> 01:24:44,620
can be nonetheless click through.
That's good way to support. Also,

1417
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:48,580
subscribe to the podcast if you
haven't already. Leave a review.

1418
01:24:48,581 --> 01:24:52,030
If you're in the mood, leave a review.
Here's the thing, I'm not saying, hey,

1419
01:24:52,210 --> 01:24:56,680
leave a review. I'm not saying to leave
a review, but I think sometimes people,

1420
01:24:56,681 --> 01:24:59,230
they want to leave a review, but they
don't like think about it. You know?

1421
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,820
And then when let's say I
get reminded like, oh shoot,

1422
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:06,040
I wanted to leave a review and
I get reminded me like, boom,

1423
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,760
then I'm going to leave a review. That's
a good one. I read all the reviews. Yeah,

1424
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:13,660
and I've read them on the podcast
before when they're really funny or I've

1425
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:18,420
quoted them on social media.
Yeah, so there's that too. Yeah.

1426
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,820
Yeah. If you write an awesome review,
well, it doesn't have to be awesome,

1427
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:26,590
but if it's funny or it's
good or it's a creative,

1428
01:25:26,591 --> 01:25:30,100
what's the, that's what I should've
said. It is a creative review.

1429
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:32,080
There's been some really good ones too.

1430
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:36,640
Same thing with Amazon reviews for tea
and books and there's a lot of people

1431
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:40,210
that get after it. I think it colorful
for sure. I would say colorful.

1432
01:25:40,211 --> 01:25:44,060
They put the main thing is
layers put a lot of layers. Yeah.

1433
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:48,550
Some people are real good at the layers.
Very impressed with that on many levels.

1434
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:53,910
I see what you did. Nonetheless,
subscribe if you a, you know,

podcast or if you want to watch and or

1439
01:26:06,831 --> 01:26:10,370
share excerpts of this podcast.
Three minutes,

1440
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:13,970
one minute sometimes. Do you
haven't made any one minute. One,

1441
01:26:13,971 --> 01:26:18,470
six minutes sometimes. Some one
minute ones. Okay. That'd be good.

1442
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:23,370
The one you just made is good.
Thanks. The time's running out. Yeah.

1443
01:26:23,371 --> 01:26:27,020
That's like a woody code. He was
settling. Enhanced, enhanced,

1444
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:31,010
I think it's called enhanced excerpt.
Enhanced excerpts,

1445
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:35,990
which means that echo has gone
and put his cinematic flair.

1446
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:40,590
No, I would say I put some music on it
and it put some text on it. There it is.

1447
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:44,990
Cinematic hats. It's enhanced it a little
bit of salt and macro flare there. Yeah.

1448
01:26:45,220 --> 01:26:48,890
All right. Well there it is. There's some
of those on there as well. By the way.

1449
01:26:49,070 --> 01:26:52,280
No big deal.
I I when I got to the gym today,

1450
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:58,580
Carl. Yeah Carl, he says,

1451
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:02,640
Hey I saw you on Worldstar.
That's when, you know,

1452
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:06,770
made it straight up in popular culture.
Popular Culture.

1453
01:27:06,860 --> 01:27:08,990
We're on Worldstar Worldstar

1454
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:13,760
if you don't know what world star is,
it originally was for fights.

1455
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:16,360
That's what I knew at
four. Yeah. That's how it,

1456
01:27:16,361 --> 01:27:20,090
I think that's how it gained game
cause it just scraps it was for,

1457
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:24,530
it was for like music videos I think
pop music videos and stuff like that.

1458
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,290
Then you get, you know, I
would watch it because they,

1459
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,350
cause people would film street fights
and I like to watch street fights. Sure.

1460
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:31,520
Learn a lot from street fights.

1461
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:35,330
And what's funny is it became such a
popular culture thing that when people

1462
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:38,180
would be recording the fights that
they're gonna then put on Worldstar.

1463
01:27:38,181 --> 01:27:42,380
They would be saying worldstar
during the fight.

1464
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,780
Someone refilming and saying
Worldstar this is going on.

1465
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:49,490
Worldstar well now guess what's on
Worldstar that goes video we made.

1466
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:54,260
It just goes on with star World Star.
That's good.

1467
01:27:54,380 --> 01:27:58,340
Nonetheless.
Cross cultural boundaries.

1468
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:01,610
Okay.
Worldstar worldstar maybe it happen.

1469
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:07,140
You did 100% but yeah, youtube,
we'll talk. We'll start.

1470
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:11,510
Thanks for putting me on there. Yeah,
it was good. That is good. Awesome.

1471
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:15,740
Youtube. Good one good way to
support also, Jack was a store.

1472
01:28:15,741 --> 01:28:17,090
It's called Jocko store.

1473
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:22,510
Obviously chocolate store.com obviously
that's where you can get shirts,

1474
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:27,980
tee shirts, some travel mugs on there.
Some rash guards, more rash guards.

1475
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:31,520
This is like Jocko gear rash guards.
So compared to,

1476
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:35,230
how would you compare them to the
origin because actually there may their

1477
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:36,620
religion. Yeah, they're similar.

1478
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:41,660
They're more like geared tour light
toward like Jocko. Well, let's,

1479
01:28:42,140 --> 01:28:45,920
yeah, let's say this, that from a,

1480
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:48,230
from a visual perspective,

1481
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:53,270
there's a way that Jocko gear looks and
there's a way that origin gear looks.

1482
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:55,130
There's some areas that overlap.

1483
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:59,480
There's some areas that don't
overlap on over there. Some of the,

1484
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:04,530
let's call them color combinations that
my brother Pete Robert's puts together.

1485
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,090
They wouldn't be allowed in the Jocko
store. They wouldn't be Jocko gear. Okay.

1486
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:13,320
And there's some things that Jocko gear
does that wouldn't be appropriate for

1487
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:18,150
origin because origin is a little
bit in the other direction.

1488
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:21,540
Sure. The overlapping
areas, all good. Yeah.

1489
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:26,310
But if you want your gear made in America,
there's one place to get it done,

1490
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:29,970
right. That's our factory up
in Maine. It's your story.

1491
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:34,500
So yeah, boom. You can get rash guards
there as well. Uh, some patches,

1492
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,700
those are restocked. A lot of people were
hitting me up. That's slide for patches.

1493
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:40,770
Yeah.
It's weird that people have to hit you up,

1494
01:29:40,771 --> 01:29:43,710
that you just don't pay attention to the
stock and say, wow, look running low.

1495
01:29:43,711 --> 01:29:47,610
I should order more. Yeah. Maybe
it's not that important to you.

1496
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:48,750
None of that's important.

1497
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,490
So I got a handle on it and I think
I have a solid system where you know,

1498
01:29:53,491 --> 01:29:56,970
we're going to run into way less
of that, if any of that. Okay.

1499
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:01,610
The less the women's stuff on there, some
hats. Cause it does mean a lot to me, eh.

1500
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:04,200
I'm saying that's cool.
So maybe I should be more,

1501
01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:08,310
I should do a better job of expressing
how important it is to me for people if

1502
01:30:08,311 --> 01:30:11,610
they want patches to be able to
get one. Yeah, maybe I haven't,

1503
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:14,970
I obviously haven't done a good job. Yeah,
it's your fault. It's your fault. It is.

1504
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,650
So yeah. [inaudible] dot com that's
good. Good, good way to support.

1505
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:23,160
Also psychological warfare. If you didn't
know what that is, that's an album,

1506
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:28,560
an album, not a music
album. It's a spoken word,

1507
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:33,030
spoken word with tracks,
chocolate tracks.

1508
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,690
And each track is designated,
formulated, engineered,

1509
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:42,290
engineered is what it is to help you
through little points of weakness that you

1510
01:30:42,571 --> 01:30:45,570
might run into on your
campaign against weakness.

1511
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:51,020
Like if you want to skip I s I always
say if you want to skip the workout,

1512
01:30:51,241 --> 01:30:54,540
if you're like, Hey, I'm too tired. I
don't feel like it. I don't feel like it.

1513
01:30:56,730 --> 01:31:01,730
I start with Alan because
that's essentially why this
whole thing exists because

1514
01:31:01,741 --> 01:31:06,741
that that was the issue that was the
genesis of this album was echo questioning

1515
01:31:08,430 --> 01:31:12,930
how he could overcome these moments of
weakness or how I do and the nights kind

1516
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:15,810
of answered one of them and
we do record those things.

1517
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,470
You know what's funny is that I asked
you that before and it wasn't that

1518
01:31:19,471 --> 01:31:22,410
specific question, but it was essentially
that question and be like, Hey,

1519
01:31:22,411 --> 01:31:23,640
what do you do?
And then you look,

1520
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,680
he kinda gave me a look in more like as
if your feelings don't matter kind of

1521
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:31,220
thing. Basically pulled the
jockey and I was like, dude,

1522
01:31:31,221 --> 01:31:34,770
your mood or if kind of the day I got
asked this similar, you know someone said,

1523
01:31:34,771 --> 01:31:37,500
Hey John, can you tell us a little
bit more about your morning routine?

1524
01:31:37,560 --> 01:31:40,350
Like what you just want, you know
your camp, I know you got up early,

1525
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:42,600
but can you tell us more about your
morning routine? I was like, yeah, listen,

1526
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:47,880
my morning routine is extremely,
extremely important.

1527
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:52,770
So here's, here's the steps of the
Jocko morning routine. First of all,

1528
01:31:52,830 --> 01:31:56,880
you set your alarm clock,
you set all your alarm clocks,

1529
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:00,100
you set the first one at four 30
you set the next one at four 35

1530
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:04,690
you set the next one at four 40 and
you have your backups. By the way,

1531
01:32:04,691 --> 01:32:07,330
you don't set your backups at the same
time cause you want to be fumbling around

1532
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:10,540
with three alarm clocks in the
morning. It's a good tip. I said,

1533
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:14,110
then you get done with that. Then when
the alarm clock goes off, you get up,

1534
01:32:14,111 --> 01:32:15,790
you get out of bed,
then you go.

1535
01:32:16,540 --> 01:32:19,900
And it's important that you get your
toothbrush out, isn't that brush.

1536
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,960
And then I use it 46 brush strokes
on each side of my mouth and no more,

1537
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:31,330
no less. And then I spit three times
to city. So yeah. And I'm like,

1538
01:32:31,331 --> 01:32:33,880
oh good. Here's the morning routine.
Dude, you get up and you go,

1539
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:39,430
well then again, no, I know, I know.

1540
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:41,260
But it's like the reality is,

1541
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,680
is someone gonna write down my morning
routine and then follow the exact same

1542
01:32:44,681 --> 01:32:47,500
thing and would that be good
for him? Maybe, I dunno.

1543
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:51,300
Well here's what their morning routine
then get up and go get up and get it.

1544
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:55,180
Yeah. But here's the, like
some people they, they,

1545
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:58,090
they focus on in this
can be beneficial from,

1546
01:32:58,091 --> 01:33:02,890
from what I hear they focus on or I they
identify certain things they do in a

1547
01:33:02,891 --> 01:33:06,820
morning routine that helps them,
that like sets them up or whatever.

1548
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:10,480
Morning routine. And I've, I actually
wrote about in the, in the field manual,

1549
01:33:10,510 --> 01:33:14,410
it's like the morning routine
starts the night before. Yeah. Yeah.

1550
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:17,780
The morning routine starts when you get
your gear ready cause you want to be

1551
01:33:17,781 --> 01:33:20,110
fumbling around in the morning.
Don't wake,

1552
01:33:20,111 --> 01:33:23,140
don't set yourself up to fumble around
with things in the morning. Right.

1553
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:27,940
That's just a bad thing. Don't do that.
So you have your gear ready. You know,

1554
01:33:27,941 --> 01:33:28,421
for me,

1555
01:33:28,421 --> 01:33:33,421
I mean I'm very systematic in pretty
much the way and throw at you.

1556
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:38,920
You know, I have like all my workout gear
is in the bathroom on hangers, you know,

1557
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:42,670
pair of shorts, shirt on each hangar,
there's six of them. They're all the same.

1558
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:44,380
There's no thought process that's needed.

1559
01:33:44,540 --> 01:33:49,060
They're all matching and I
have the same kind of socks.

1560
01:33:49,061 --> 01:33:52,420
All my socks are the same.
I do have black socks and white socks,

1561
01:33:52,421 --> 01:33:56,470
but one girl or is just completely
white sox. All the same.

1562
01:33:56,940 --> 01:34:01,040
You grabbed those, you put those on, boom.
You brush your teeth, boom, you take,

1563
01:34:01,150 --> 01:34:04,660
I take my supplements in
the morning and at night,

1564
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:07,900
but I take my micro oil and my,
my joint warfare boom,

1565
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:13,510
and then I go hit it. How much
water teaching? It's it's,
I drink when I'm thirsty,

1566
01:34:13,511 --> 01:34:18,060
I drink and then if I'm, I
don't measure it. You don't
be like, okay, no, let me dig.

1567
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,020
I drink when I'm thirsty.
I eat when I'm hungry.

1568
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:25,600
But if you drink water
when you're thirsty, you're
already 2% dehydrated. Okay,

1569
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:26,770
well I drank a little bit more.

1570
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,600
I drink about 3% more than all right.
There you go.

1571
01:34:31,930 --> 01:34:36,910
So you 1%, uh, over, over
hydrated or hydrated now less. Uh,

1572
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:40,150
but well, you know like all drink
a whole thing like the, you know,

1573
01:34:40,151 --> 01:34:42,760
the mugs that we have to travel
there three ounces by the way.

1574
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:46,630
I'll drink a whole thing of that just
routine. That's kind of the routine.

1575
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:49,870
But what's it like in the morning?
You had to pound it.

1576
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:52,030
Sure.

1577
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:55,210
If you want to call it pounded and the
drink it cause you want to stay hydrated.

1578
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:59,650
Get the water back in there man. Get
it. Okay. That sounds good for you.

1579
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:02,050
Water is good for you by
the way. Yeah, no doubt.

1580
01:35:02,051 --> 01:35:04,800
It's better than soda in the morning.
You were drink a coke in the morning.

1581
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:05,300
No Bro.

1582
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:09,900
It's like the worst we did these
monster mash is back in the or,

1583
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:14,960
so my son was doing the monster mash
with us when he was like six or c.

1584
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:16,550
What's the monster? Mash is like, Yo,

1585
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:19,560
you do rope climbs that you
do a sprint workout swimming,

1586
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:23,270
that you do pull ups in the EU and they
put little things in there sometimes.

1587
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:28,250
So one of the things that they had to
do was drink a coke through a straw.

1588
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:33,830
So you're like doing pull ups in a rope
climb in the coke. Yeah. And so he uh,

1589
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:38,350
he, he, I think that was the first
time you ever tried soda. [inaudible]

1590
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:43,340
nasty. Well there's of
wanting soda though. Yeah.

1591
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:47,780
The,
there's two elements to drinking a soda,

1592
01:35:47,781 --> 01:35:50,300
especially for the first time
is okay. It tastes weird. Sweet.

1593
01:35:50,301 --> 01:35:52,970
Sugary and carbonated.
Carbonated will burn your mind.

1594
01:35:52,971 --> 01:35:56,110
It feels like it's burning your mouth.
Yeah. He's like, yeah, you can't do that.

1595
01:35:56,630 --> 01:35:59,240
That's up right in the middle of the work,
not to check and do that.

1596
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:02,360
You keep in mind,
you just described your morning routine.

1597
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,450
You answered the question that they were,
I know you didn't answer.

1598
01:36:05,451 --> 01:36:06,261
That's why I said,
look,

1599
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:10,520
I'm not trying to be negative against
morning routines and there's pretty much

1600
01:36:10,521 --> 01:36:15,350
what I do. But the reason
is I think people think, Oh,

1601
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:19,280
if I have, if I knew your morning
routine, then I'd know what the secret is.

1602
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:22,790
It's like, hey man, the secret is get up
and go do something. That's the secret.

1603
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,940
Yeah. I'm not going to say,
here's the deal. Here's the deal.

1604
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:29,150
I'm not going to sell you my morning
routine as the solution to your problems.

1605
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:32,870
Now I will say that if you
fumble around in the morning,

1606
01:36:32,990 --> 01:36:34,370
it's going to cause you
problems throughout the day,

1607
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,870
so I don't fumble it on in the morning.
Set your,

1608
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:40,580
set your life up correctly so that
you're not fumbling around. That's good.

1609
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,810
I'm not going to sell you my morning
routine as the solution to your problems.

1610
01:36:45,250 --> 01:36:46,340
I'm not going to do that,

1611
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:51,520
but I will say that if you do have a
good system that you go through in the

1612
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:56,030
morning, it will set up
your day correctly. Yeah.

1613
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:58,700
That's why I think people ask why
people want it and I get it. Okay,

1614
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:01,880
so I'm not trying to be
like a jerk. Right. I'm not
trying to get that negative.

1615
01:37:02,150 --> 01:37:04,510
I guess I'm kind of making five boy,
you're making fun,

1616
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:05,870
making fun of morning
routines a little bit,

1617
01:37:05,871 --> 01:37:08,420
but at the same time I have
one tonight and I stick to it,

1618
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:11,450
but I think that's a thing.
I don't,

1619
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:15,230
I don't actually have something and I
stick to it like I do. This is what it is.

1620
01:37:15,260 --> 01:37:18,410
I follow the functional thing
that works and you stick to it.

1621
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:21,920
Yeah and I stick to it.
So that's that. But I do,

1622
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:24,110
I did like designed my morning routine.

1623
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:26,360
I didn't see who I'm going to
design this program. No know.

1624
01:37:26,361 --> 01:37:29,840
It's like I know what works.
It's functional and that's what I do.

1625
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,590
I do things that work and everyone else
wants to know what works well there you

1626
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:36,710
not everyone figured out on their own
what works. I guess. Here's the thing.

1627
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:38,870
Your morning routine,
your,

1628
01:37:38,871 --> 01:37:43,460
you're ultimately right and I think this
is super important not to forget or not

1629
01:37:43,461 --> 01:37:48,290
to like miss interpret where
you don't use just quote.

1630
01:37:48,291 --> 01:37:49,960
You just said like your morning routines,

1631
01:37:49,980 --> 01:37:52,010
not going to be the solution
to your problems kind of thing.

1632
01:37:52,670 --> 01:37:56,010
I think that's what people do think.
I think that here is someone with

1633
01:37:56,010 --> 01:37:58,140
a level hate in my opinion.
I don't, I don't know,

1634
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:01,770
but this is what it seems like where
someone with a level head and they want to

1635
01:38:01,771 --> 01:38:02,910
look for just that. Just, just,

1636
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,510
just that one thing that's going to
help them just a little bit, you know?

1637
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,840
So they're going to be like, Hey, let me,
let me formulate a good morning routine.

1638
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:13,290
I don't know that much about effective
routines, so let me look into that.

1639
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:16,020
Just has a little helper,
not the solution to my problems,

1640
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:19,140
which I think some people may kind of
miss. No, you're right. You're right.

1641
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:20,670
And that's why,
like I said,

1642
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:25,290
I'm not belittling the idea that a
morning routine is helpful because it

1643
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:29,430
certainly is. Yeah. It might add some,

1644
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:35,700
some tiny bit of help to your desk
if you're doing the right thing.

1645
01:38:35,870 --> 01:38:39,720
Some benefits. Thank you. It might
benefit your day, which is positive.

1646
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:44,520
Will it cure your overall problems
of life? No, but you know what?

1647
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:48,120
It's a good place to start. That's
why we say wake up early. Right? Yeah.

1648
01:38:48,121 --> 01:38:53,040
That's part of the routine, but even
how you, I guess I am being a jerk.

1649
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:57,330
Yeah. But here's the thing. Let
me, let me, let me just like, yeah,

1650
01:38:57,331 --> 01:39:00,990
get on a good morning routine. That's
a good idea. I like it. Yeah. Yeah.

1651
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:04,320
I'm not trying to make fun of
it. I was, but I'm not anymore.

1652
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:07,680
It seems like you're making fun of it
for people because this is what it may be

1653
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:10,290
sounded like when someone asks you,
what's your morning routine?

1654
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,980
It sounds like you,
you're kind of with this presumption,

1655
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:17,850
like you're presuming or assuming that
they think it's going to solve all their

1656
01:39:17,851 --> 01:39:20,430
problems. That's kind of
what it's saying. Yes.

1657
01:39:20,431 --> 01:39:24,180
But in that very specific direction,
like if someone says, Hey, look,

1658
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:28,800
I'm always looking for things to benefit
my day and my effectiveness. You know,

1659
01:39:28,801 --> 01:39:29,491
I've, uh, you know,

1660
01:39:29,491 --> 01:39:32,460
I do this and do that and I found that
this helps a little bit here and there.

1661
01:39:32,461 --> 01:39:33,570
Hey,
what's your morning routine?

1662
01:39:33,571 --> 01:39:37,170
Maybe I can incorporate one or more
of your reading maybe into mind.

1663
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:39,940
That'll give me a little bit of help to,
I don't think you would have came off.

1664
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:43,950
Yeah, definitely. That would have been
a very good question. Here's what I do.

1665
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:44,851
So there you go.

1666
01:39:44,851 --> 01:39:49,230
So you get how you said the question
like you were kind of impersonating

1667
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:56,130
watch her morning routine, like making
them sign off. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1668
01:39:56,131 --> 01:39:59,550
Everyone. Not, not so good. So
good. We got to the bottom of it.

1669
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:01,110
You can have your drinking water.

1670
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:05,490
Another drink you can drink is you can
drink something called Jocko white tea.

1671
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,020
It's available on Amazon.

1672
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:11,250
Now this is the only tea available,

1673
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:12,660
not only in America,

1674
01:40:12,661 --> 01:40:17,040
but in the world that comes with
an 8,000 pound dead lift guarantee.

1675
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,510
So there's no other tea.
I never send something out there that are,

1676
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:25,710
that are they say 6,000 they say they
can get your 6,000 pound deadlifts. Yeah,

1677
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:26,663
there's,
I've seen,

1678
01:40:26,670 --> 01:40:31,260
I've seen 7,272 some teas.

1679
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:36,800
Some white tees say they'll get you 7,200
and there's only one white tea that'll

1680
01:40:37,291 --> 01:40:41,670
get you the guaranteed 8,000
pound deadlift. Good. There's
some layers on the tea,

1681
01:40:41,940 --> 01:40:46,000
which I kind of remembered last time. I
didn't want to interrupt, interrupt you.

1682
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:50,670
You, you're talking his first
episode of this podcast.

1683
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:52,530
Absolute first one.
Oh yeah.

1684
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:57,560
I think the only one that doesn't start
with this is Jocko podcast number.

1685
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:01,990
That's cause you had a different vision
of the at the time with no we, yeah.

1686
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:07,150
And then the last it started with you
were thinking of this podcast is to be

1687
01:41:07,151 --> 01:41:11,230
100% that's what it felt
like. That first one.

1688
01:41:11,231 --> 01:41:16,000
That's what it felt like in your
mind. Yeah. In my mind, if you listen,

1689
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:19,180
yeah. Now you can see I was
not, I was not ready to Cruz.

1690
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:23,260
I came in there with a game plan.
The game plan did not say cruise on it.

1691
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:26,860
He became friends and get after it.
It's funny as you shut it down so quick,

1692
01:41:26,861 --> 01:41:28,630
right when you heard it you were like,
hey,

1693
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:32,770
you know you want to cut it at
this point, not the, not the,

1694
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,530
the little car like we just
rolled into a conversation.

1695
01:41:35,620 --> 01:41:38,170
But here's the thing with that
conversation, as far as the layers go,

1696
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:41,920
we talk about white tea, Chai. Yeah, no,

1697
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:43,960
cause I was trying to remember
what kind of tea that was.

1698
01:41:43,961 --> 01:41:46,900
I don't know about the tea,
especially back then. Nonetheless,

1699
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:52,200
you are always on the pomegranate
that started when I was in the dirt.

1700
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:55,240
So anyways,
you can get that,

1701
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:58,480
you can get it on Amazon and
then you can start dead lifting

1702
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:04,750
properly. There's some books that
you can get way the warrior kid.

1703
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:10,380
I get questions all the time about
how you should raise your kids and,

1704
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,740
and, and, and not just how
to raise him cause he'd,

1705
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,510
people know how to raise him but they not
how to raise him, but how to raise him.

1706
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:18,490
Like they know what they want the kids to,

1707
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,780
they know the values that
they want the kids to have,

1708
01:42:20,781 --> 01:42:23,770
but they're not sure how to give them the
values. They don't know how to do that.

1709
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:29,050
So it w real simple, get them this book
way of the Warrior Kit that that's,

1710
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:33,790
you know, discipline, eating
habits, working out, dealing
with bullies, how to study.

1711
01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:37,660
All those things are in there. These are
the things you want, not just your kid,

1712
01:42:37,661 --> 01:42:42,661
but the children of the world
to have these type of qualities.

1713
01:42:44,020 --> 01:42:48,640
And now on top of that,
we have way of the warrior kid too,

1714
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:52,180
which is called Mark's mission.
Just talks about some important lessons,

1715
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:55,780
controlling your temper,
overcoming fear of failure,

1716
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:00,220
working hard, saving money, being frugal,

1717
01:43:00,340 --> 01:43:04,150
dealing with verbal abuse,
helping other people,

1718
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:07,210
starting businesses. Yeah, I said that.

1719
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,610
And becoming a leader again,
all the,

1720
01:43:12,611 --> 01:43:16,720
there's no human being that would look
at the lessons from way of the warrior

1721
01:43:16,721 --> 01:43:21,510
kid and say would say, I don't want
my kid to have that quality. No,

1722
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:25,420
the qualities are in there.
So there's that.

1723
01:43:26,440 --> 01:43:28,900
And if you want a good
example of a warrior kid,

1724
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,090
checkout Irish oaks ranch.com
where you can get soap.

1725
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:38,140
That's a handmade by young Aiden who's
12 years old. But he has a business,

1726
01:43:38,200 --> 01:43:43,060
no big deal. He's making
soap. Yeah. Goat milk soap,

1727
01:43:43,670 --> 01:43:47,570
that's soaps actually good like to
use. So for sure, let's face it,

1728
01:43:48,290 --> 01:43:51,990
you know how you have your
friend and his wife makes

1729
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,000
soap on the weekend sympathy
purchase scenario and it's beautiful.

1730
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:01,740
It has the little packaging and then
you say, all right, it's soap. Um,

1731
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,340
let me go ahead and use some
soap. And you're like, pride.

1732
01:44:03,341 --> 01:44:06,800
This isn't like usable soap.
This is the novelty decorative item.

1733
01:44:07,010 --> 01:44:10,460
It was a cool little educational
experience because he asked me, you know,

1734
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:15,170
he was making soap and he's, and he
reached out to me. His Dad is, uh, uh,

1735
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:19,280
a farmer, also a firefighter,
but he's a farmer. Anyways,

1736
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:23,990
his dad and I were connected.
I buy meat from his dad and you know,

1737
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:26,120
he said all my son wants
to get in touch with you.

1738
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:30,650
But as we're going through the process,
he sends me like his label for the soap.

1739
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:34,790
Yeah. And you know, it looked nice,
but um, went back with, you know,

1740
01:44:34,791 --> 01:44:39,320
this needs to be an OCR
standard. Yeah. So anyways, yeah,

1741
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:42,950
it's cool little learning process
and yeah, you can get that soap.

1742
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:47,870
You could support a kid that's a
warrior kid. And the Jocko soap motto,

1743
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:52,340
which I give aid, no credit for.
Sorry Aiden, you're a good kid.

1744
01:44:52,341 --> 01:44:54,300
But you didn't think of this.
It took the,

1745
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:58,520
it took the masterful marketing mind
or Jocko to come up with the motto for

1746
01:44:58,521 --> 01:45:02,270
Jocko Soap,
which is stay clean.

1747
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:06,020
It's good. And you know, there's
some layers on that too, right?

1748
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:10,730
Like a Motorhead song. Oh,
all right. There you go.

1749
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:15,470
And you like Motorhead and I am a huge
fan of Motorhead and you don't do any

1750
01:45:15,471 --> 01:45:15,981
drugs.

1751
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:20,690
So there's the kind of the reason that
whenever I talk to people or people talk

1752
01:45:20,691 --> 01:45:21,524
to me on the,
uh,

1753
01:45:21,530 --> 01:45:25,730
through social media or email and
they've had a drug problem or an alcohol

1754
01:45:25,731 --> 01:45:30,710
problem and I always kind of sign off
like, Hey, stay clean, stay clean.

1755
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:35,750
So cause that's also what Lemmy from
Motorhead was saying. Stay clean.

1756
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:37,580
Like don't let this kill you.
Now,

1757
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:41,960
let me from Motorhead was a rare dude
who did a lot of drugs and alcohol and

1758
01:45:41,961 --> 01:45:45,440
somehow was able to survive very
well up to up to when he died,

1759
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:50,270
drinking incredible amounts
of Jack Daniels. Yeah.

1760
01:45:50,271 --> 01:45:54,730
Those are some legit layers, but he
always would say, don't do it. Yeah.

1761
01:45:54,920 --> 01:45:57,890
He's a guy that would say, don't
do it. It's done. Don't do it.

1762
01:45:58,010 --> 01:46:02,870
Don't do what people do. Don't
do drugs. Stay clean. Stay clean.

1763
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:06,320
There you go. Uh, in addition to that,

1764
01:46:06,480 --> 01:46:09,980
I've got another book called the
discipline equals freedom field manual.

1765
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:13,520
And if this is, this is a good point.
If you know someone that's off the path,

1766
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:18,250
right? Like people go off the
path in life and it doesn't take,

1767
01:46:18,251 --> 01:46:20,900
we talked about this last time, it
doesn't take, but one step off the path.

1768
01:46:20,990 --> 01:46:22,640
When you're on a slippery slope,

1769
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,670
it's a slippery slope when
you step off the path.

1770
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:31,000
So if you know someone that has taken a
step off the path and they're starting

1771
01:46:31,251 --> 01:46:35,480
to slide down, get him this book to
get them on the path, the right path.

1772
01:46:35,780 --> 01:46:37,610
And there's also a chance

1773
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:43,010
that the person that
stepped off the path is you.

1774
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,560
So get the field manual.

1775
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,920
It's got the faults and actions
that are to be on the right path.

1776
01:46:53,040 --> 01:46:56,670
Make yourself better,
faster, stronger, smarter,

1777
01:47:00,340 --> 01:47:04,300
anything else,
more physically fit and healthier.

1778
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:10,840
The audio version of that is on
iTunes, Amazon music, Google play,

1779
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:12,190
other MP3 platforms.

1780
01:47:12,191 --> 01:47:15,640
It's not on audible because then you
can't have it as an album with tracks,

1781
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:17,890
which we obviously
support extreme ownership.

1782
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:23,080
The first book I wrote with my brother
Leif Babin over a million copies sold.

1783
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:27,070
There's a lot of copies sold.
Yes, that's a lot of copies sold.

1784
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:30,280
You know how many copies they told us
would be successful because we didn't know

1785
01:47:30,281 --> 01:47:33,310
any Lafe and I didn't know anything
about the publishing world. Wait,

1786
01:47:33,311 --> 01:47:34,144
what do you mean?

1787
01:47:34,390 --> 01:47:38,260
When we were getting on the book was
getting ready to come out and I would talk

1788
01:47:38,261 --> 01:47:39,610
to the point where we're
talking to a publisher.

1789
01:47:39,611 --> 01:47:42,730
Lafe and I were talking to the
publisher and he says, you know,

1790
01:47:42,731 --> 01:47:45,760
if this is a successful book, then
you know it'll, it'll really be,

1791
01:47:45,761 --> 01:47:48,630
it will be good to see blah blah blah.
And I saw like the standard, like a myth,

1792
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:53,590
like a certain amount. That's the
socially no. So I said, hey, what a,

1793
01:47:53,591 --> 01:47:58,310
I don't know anything about this. What
is considered to be a successful book?

1794
01:47:58,630 --> 01:48:03,580
You know what the number was? 20,000
bucks thing. He goes, yeah. He goes, hey,

1795
01:48:03,581 --> 01:48:06,760
you know, we're, we're printing 12,000
on this first round and if you sell,

1796
01:48:06,761 --> 01:48:09,670
if you don't, we'll print some more. But
if you can sell 20,000 books, that's,

1797
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:12,840
that's going to be, that's a huge
success. And it will be. We'll be proud.

1798
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:18,330
So here we are. We're 1 million.
Dang. It's pretty cool. Yeah.

1799
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:22,020
Good Job Leif. Babin good job. Both. Yeah,

1800
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:27,850
they've tells a story that we got home
from Ramadi and the only time I ever told

1801
01:48:27,851 --> 01:48:29,650
him anything positive
was when we got home.

1802
01:48:29,651 --> 01:48:32,950
We'd been home for like two weeks
and I told him that the Delta platoon

1803
01:48:32,951 --> 01:48:35,200
commander, Hey, good job. Over there.

1804
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:42,370
So yeah, we're keen. I likes to keep
it real. Yeah, man. And actually,

1805
01:48:42,371 --> 01:48:44,800
you know what though?
Good job over there seems real simple,

1806
01:48:44,801 --> 01:48:48,180
but I'm sure in that context he
was probably the most loaded. Yeah,

1807
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:52,960
good job anyone's ever heard. Yeah,
yeah. I believe you're correct.

1808
01:48:53,650 --> 01:48:58,030
Beyond the books and beyond
the podcast also echelon front,

1809
01:48:58,031 --> 01:48:58,870
speaking of life and me,

1810
01:48:58,871 --> 01:49:03,280
this is our leadership and management
consulting company. This is the thing,

1811
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,710
every, this is a bold statement, right?

1812
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,970
Every problem in every
organization is leadership problem.

1813
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:14,980
That's a bold statement to make.
Yeah. And I'll say it again.

1814
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:18,490
Every problem in every organization
is a leadership problem.

1815
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:22,420
So if there's a problem in
an organization, the problem,

1816
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:24,820
it boils down to leadership on some level.

1817
01:49:25,870 --> 01:49:30,850
So what we do is we fixed the leadership
and thereby we fix your problems.

1818
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:35,530
It's me, it's Leif Babin, it's
JP Denelle. It's Dave Burke.

1819
01:49:35,980 --> 01:49:38,090
Good deal.
Dave Burke till Dave,

1820
01:49:39,730 --> 01:49:42,520
if you want to get in touch with us
to have us come out and work with your

1821
01:49:42,521 --> 01:49:46,270
company, get your
leadership aligned, go to

1822
01:49:46,271 --> 01:49:51,271

1823
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:55,930
and of course we are
approaching the muster,

1824
01:49:57,100 --> 01:50:01,390
the leadership seminar.
Be Learn,

1825
01:50:01,420 --> 01:50:05,560
you learn tactics of leadership,
you learn strategies of leadership,

1826
01:50:05,561 --> 01:50:09,310
you learn pragmatic techniques.

1827
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:14,370
You can execute as a leader that will
make you and your team when we already

1828
01:50:15,761 --> 01:50:17,020
expanded the floor.

1829
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:21,910
So we expanded the four as much as we
could already because the ticket sales are

1830
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:26,620
going quickly. And so we've got both, uh,

1831
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,990
places that we're doing the muster.
We've got an expanded as much as we can.

1832
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,490
It doesn't matter.
They're both,

1833
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:36,010
both of them are going to
sell out doing two this year,

1834
01:50:36,011 --> 01:50:41,011
only Washington DC May 17th and 18th
and San Francisco October 17th and 18th.

1835
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:47,560
The whole team will be there and
we will be with you. If you come,

1836
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:50,590
we'll be hanging out. We'll be answering
questions that we'll be talking,

1837
01:50:50,591 --> 01:50:52,540
we'll be eating lunch.
We'll be,

1838
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:56,230
we'll be hanging out working
out with all of you that come.

1839
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,550
There's no green room.

1840
01:50:58,500 --> 01:50:59,100
Yeah,

1841
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:02,100
there's no backstage where,

1842
01:51:02,101 --> 01:51:06,750
where life is sitting back there in the
backstage with cucumbers on his eyes to

1843
01:51:06,751 --> 01:51:11,700
relax. That's not happening. No,
no. We're hanging out all of us.
