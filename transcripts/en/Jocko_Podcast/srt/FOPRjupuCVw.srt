1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,450
This is Jocko podcast number
74 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,450
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,683
now.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,160
I always dug music and I'm pretty sure
it started when my dad would play a Hank

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,220
Williams sr on the eight track in his,

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,530
I think it was a 1971 barracuda
and he'd play that trip,

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,750
that tape just over and over again.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,340
And I still know those songs by
heart. And then, you know, like I,

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,360
that was when I was a little kid and
then I got a little bit older and like a

10
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:49,770
lot of kids, all of a sudden I was
listening to the Beatles. Elvis

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,000
thought they were great.
I still think that song,

12
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,160
while my guitar gently
weeps is a good song,

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,720
but that wore out kind of quickly and
it was something wasn't there in that

14
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,030
music.
Something just wasn't quite there.

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,970
The music didn't sound how I felt.

16
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,530
And then in 1980

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,040
ACDC back in black came out
and it was popular. Right?

18
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,430
It was popular.

19
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,170
And so it went into my ears at
some point and I said, Dang,

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,550
all right, better closer. Sure. Warmer.

21
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,660
We're getting there and then I washed
around in the hard rock for a while,

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,063
Hendrix

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,460
led Zeppelin and I can't help throwing
it on a little Jack Black when I say

24
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,400
that. If you watch that
tribute that he did to them

25
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,390
and that you know,

26
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,750
some of the kids that I hung
around with and New England,

27
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,670
they rode that train down to hippiedom.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,410
You know we're talking Crosby,

29
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:07,860
stills and Nash and Janice Joplin
and the grateful dead and all that.

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,160
I couldn't relate, wasn't
there. It didn't get there.

31
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,450
Didn't seem to reflect the world
that I was beginning to see myself.

32
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:20,220
I got on the other train.
Right,

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,630
and we're talking about van Halen.
Yes.

34
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:29,631
This is the 1980s you know if you were a
kid in America age 13 we got issued the

35
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:36,540
album 1984 by van Halen.
That was just a given.

36
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:39,810
You are going to get that
God is your diver down. Boom.

37
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:42,300
You can need to listen to this.
This is rock and roll people.

38
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,350
This is Eddie van Halen. Listen to that
Guitar Solo eruption listened again.

39
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,580
Do it again. Iron Maiden, right?

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,800
Actual Song called trooper, you know, you
got to listen to that when you're a kid.

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,290
And so now I'm heading
in the right direction.

42
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:02,650
I'm feeling it is starting to reflect
what the things are like in my head.

43
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,930
And then there was that day

44
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,260
where I got

45
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,910
an album called black sabbath
by a band called black sabbath.

46
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,850
And the first song is
also called black Sabbath.

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,490
And I put that on and boom,

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,970
I had found something that sounded

49
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,150
like I was thinking.

50
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,150
And from there I was
definitely on the right train.

51
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,420
Then it was Motorhead and
soon after the Ramones boom.

52
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,230
And then that leads to the sex pistols
cause you're just going harder.

53
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,760
That's what you do.
That's what I was doing.

54
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,160
Like what's a little bit harder than that?
What's a little bit harder than that?

55
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:55,510
Sex pistols, bodies, no feelings.

56
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,010
They're singing songs, no feelings.
Okay, I hear what you're saying. Louder,

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,450
more anger.
And then finally we get to black flag

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,720
my war side to still one of my
all time favorites. Minor threat.

59
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,870
Get Ahold of a little band. Another
little band from DC called the bad brains.

60
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,620
Some Detroit hardcore negative approach.

61
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,320
And then so I was, you know, I was
Kinda in the game, right? I was there.

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,800
And so 87 rolls around and one of my
friends who is actually more of a metal

63
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,880
head at this time,

64
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,520
he gives me a cassette tape cause this
was dark and the dairy when you were just

65
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:44,090
going to have to listen to cassette tapes
and they were usually dubbed 47 times

66
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:45,860
from somebody else.
But the eye,

67
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,500
this was the real tape and
this was the real deal.

68
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,530
This was an actual original with
the full cover on it and everything.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,380
And the cover of this tape was just
a giant mushroom cloud of death and

70
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:02,381
destruction and above the mushroom cloud
in large old English script blazed.

71
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:09,230
And across the top it said Cro mags.

72
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,143
Okay.

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,610
And then underneath the mushroom cloud
in a little bit smaller script and old

74
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:21,870
English, it said the age of coral. Okay.

75
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,630
So I put it in my tape deck
and I press play.

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,460
And the first track
it hit me like a training

77
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,020
and it's the first track was
called the we got to know.

78
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,660
And let me just tell you the lyrics.
Sure. Struggling in the streets.

79
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,200
Just trying to survive, searching
for the truth, just to keep us alive.

80
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,740
Got To break these cha shackles,
got to break these chains.

81
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,500
The only way we'll do it
as if we use our brains,

82
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,900
there's gotta be some meaning
to the purpose of life.

83
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,750
I know there must be more
than the struggle and strife
looking for the answers

84
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:03,350
and I need a clue, but my mind
is so disturbed now what do I do

85
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,020
now? I can tell you I was not
struggling in the streets,

86
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,660
but like most teenage kids,
I did feel some shackles,

87
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,260
right?

88
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,260
You feel the shackles of things and I
was looking for answers and I needed to

89
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,440
clue and so I was like, hmm, yeah,

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,250
we're on to something. The next
title track had me a little worried.

91
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,080
I'm a little concerned cause you know,
like I said,

92
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:35,081
there was a lot of kids were taking the
hippie route and so I was not into that.

93
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,290
The next song title had
me a little concerned.

94
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:44,291
It was the song was called world peace
as I was kind of Oh red flag and then I

95
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:50,720
listen to the lyrics,
lyrics, all you hippies,

96
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:53,060
better state start to face reality.

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,140
Are You all your far
fetched dreams of anarchy?

98
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:01,310
Better start to see things the way they
are because the way things are going,

99
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,380
they won't be going far. World piece
can't be done. It just can't exist.

100
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,270
World piece can't be done
and arche is a mess. Okay.

101
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,520
And the rest of the album kept
up that assault on my brain,

102
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,290
on my attitude.
And that was it.

103
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:28,520
I had found something called
hardcore music and it,

104
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,990
I never really left it.

105
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,030
And I listened to Cro mags and a ton
of other hardcore bands from that time

106
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,961
until now.

107
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:40,961
And that's pretty much essentially
the soundtrack of much of my life.

108
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:45,560
And it had a pretty big influence on me.
And it was an attitude

109
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,320
that I kept throughout my life
and it was my own interpretation.

110
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,200
I can tell you that right now.
It was my own kind of, you know,

111
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:57,440
you listen to the lyrics and you kind
of apply what it means in your world.

112
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,280
That's what I did,

113
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:04,330
which to me was pretty simple because
to me hardcore meant hardcore.

114
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,580
That's weird. That's pretty simple.
Hardcore in everything. You do.

115
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:12,050
Work hard to be aggressive, don't back
down, fight for what you believe in,

116
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:15,350
hold the line.
And that's kind of what I did in my life.

117
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,760
And I dunno,
like a year ago or something,

118
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,580
somebody asked me something about,
you know, on, on the interwebs,

119
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,710
someone said, oh Yo, what, what, what band
should I listen to? You know, I said, oh,

120
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,850
Bob, Blah Blah Cro mags, you
know, check them out, whatever.

121
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,430
And you might want to do that.
And eventually, you know,

122
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:44,680
it's the, the Internet is an incredible
thing. And eventually I, I, uh,

123
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,200
the founding member of the chromatics
guy by the name of Harley Flanagan,

124
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,740
sure. He like reached out and say,
Hey, what's up man? How are you doing?

125
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,140
And I had heard over the years,
you know,

126
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,680
that Harley was [inaudible] guy,

127
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,800
black belt in Jujitsu. And so, you know,

128
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:09,580
he's just kinda hit me up
and eventually, you know,

129
00:09:09,581 --> 00:09:12,200
we were talking and he said, Hey, I've
got a book coming out and send it to you.

130
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,950
And I said, cool. Yeah. And he said, man,
the books crazy. And I was kind of like,

131
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,190
yeah, you know? Yeah, I know man, because
you know how I was around that. It's cool.

132
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,900
I get it. It's kind of crazy. And he's
like, no, no, no man, it's, it's crazy.

133
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,790
And I said, okay, cool.
So he sent it to me

134
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,130
and then I read the book and
Damn,

135
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,240
I had, I had no idea, actually,

136
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:42,710
I had a semblance of an idea, you
know, because in the hardcore scene,

137
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:46,730
people know each other. I mean like, you
know that you know, you after a show,

138
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:49,490
you talk to everyone and it's
the band members, it's people.

139
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,020
Everyone kind of knows each other.
So I had heard stories, but the book,

140
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:57,170
when the reality behind the stories was,

141
00:09:57,171 --> 00:10:01,940
was way more intense and crazy
than I could have a, a thought.

142
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:03,890
It was and it was one point
when I was reading the book,

143
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:05,780
I'm going to read a
little excerpt right now

144
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,000
and it said this,

145
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,660
this is hardly when I
started working on this book,

146
00:10:17,661 --> 00:10:21,650
I was staying at a hotel in the red
light district in Amsterdam in Amsterdam.

147
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,120
The working title was the longest
suicide note ever written.

148
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,160
I was trying to document the madness
from as far back as I can remember until

149
00:10:34,161 --> 00:10:34,994
the end,

150
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:41,230
the story of my life as an insane suicidal
joy ride of rock and roll depravity

151
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,840
and demise until the final crash and burn.

152
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,610
It was going to be a book that all the
great fuckups never got to write cause

153
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:57,240
they died first.
So I began working on it.

154
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,890
I figured the end would've
come sooner than later,

155
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,200
but I was wrong.
And

156
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,020
once I got done reading the book, I
reached out to Harley and I said, hey man,

157
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,070
there's a lot in this book.
That's crazy.

158
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,400
And the fact that you live through it
in the fact that you got through it and

159
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:24,090
the fact that you got to the position
that you're in now with your life,

160
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,280
I think a lot of people can learn from it.

161
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,110
And it'd be awesome if you come
onto the podcast and Harley said,

162
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,740
let's do it.
So Harley Flanagan,

163
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,940
welcome to the show, man.
It's great to be here.

164
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,780
Thank you for having me
on. Yeah, it's awesome.

165
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,050
And I saw you several times when I was
a kid and we were trying to figure out

166
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,010
names of clubs where I saw you,

167
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:53,920
but that was pretty cool and
it's pretty cool to be here.

168
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,610
I guess we're talking about,
uh, 30 years later. You know,

169
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,320
cause I was seeing you
when I was in my teens,

170
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,760
14 1315 around there and here we are.

171
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,600
Pretty amazing trip we've had since then.
Yeah.

172
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,130
And usually when I ask
people, Hey, you know,

173
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,950
talk about where you come from
quickly and kind of where you grew up.

174
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,710
And we don't spend a lot of time there
because most people didn't really do

175
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,610
anything significant that had any long
term impact on their lives when they're

176
00:12:21,611 --> 00:12:25,780
like eight, nine, 10 years
old. Right. But for you,

177
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,530
I mean, when you were eight, nine,
10 years old, shit was already crazy.

178
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,450
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, she was pretty
much crazy from the start.

179
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,950
Yeah.
I'm gonna,

180
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,020
I'm gonna just kind of pull
a little something here out
of the book just to give

181
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:47,460
a little bit of background. This is from
Harleys book, hardcore life on my own.

182
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,300
I was born at San Francisco
General Hospital on March 8th,

183
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,640
1967 at the start of the summer of love.

184
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,350
My mom's name is rose
Marie Fillioux fill you,

185
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,000
fail you.
And my dad's name was Harley Wayne Walker.

186
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,550
Flan again.
My mom was a hippie.

187
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,610
My Dad was a drifter and somehow their
paths crossed before the hippie days.

188
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:18,930
My mom was into all the
early rock and roll stuff,

189
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:22,080
Motown and pretty much all the music
that was happening when she was young.

190
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,630
Her father, Juan failure. Yes.

191
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:29,631
One Phil Yu wan Fairview came from
the Dr. The Dominican Republic came to

192
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:34,620
America through Ellis island by himself
when he was in his early teens and one

193
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:37,950
was the first was one of the first
Americans to join the United States army

194
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,310
served in world war two where
he played in the military band.

195
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,370
That's how he got his citizenship
by serving in the military.

196
00:13:44,371 --> 00:13:46,320
He was one of the funniest
people I ever knew.

197
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,300
You worked all kinds of different jobs,

198
00:13:48,301 --> 00:13:52,410
everything from building a building super
to a long storm and he was a charming

199
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:54,540
guy with a thick Spanish accent.

200
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,530
So that's the beginnings.

201
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
Do you speak any Spanish a curse?
A little bit about,

202
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,460
so you've got that
now you continue on.

203
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:12,450
My mom was a go go dancer
and like so many people,

204
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:17,451
she was caught up in the whole drug
culture of the 60s when I was a kid.

205
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,290
She was still a stripper.

206
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,430
I remember going to work with her a few
times when I was little. That was weird.

207
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,990
Looking back on it now,

208
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,510
there was even a short period of
time when she was a Dominatrix,

209
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,190
but that was later.

210
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,070
My Dad left home for good or
around the same age as me,

211
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,460
maybe 14 or 15 and started
riding freight trains.

212
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,360
He liked to live from moment to
moment and from everything I've heard.

213
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:47,810
He had a serious drug and
alcohol issues most of his life.

214
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,210
He was always in and out of prison.

215
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,060
It's

216
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,260
hard to accept that your dad
chose heroin and alcohol over you.

217
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,760
It really does kind of hurt even now.

218
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,720
I guess that might be one of the
reasons why it turned out the way I did.

219
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:11,220
My mom and me did a lot of hitchhiking
and stayed with a lot of different people.

220
00:15:11,221 --> 00:15:14,340
A lot of crazy shit happen on those trips.
At one point,

221
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,240
a friend of hers was going to Europe
and asked, do you want to come?

222
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,030
And my mom was like,
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

223
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,040
She did and I went with
her. I was probably around
three or four that was that.

224
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,170
I never saw my father again.

225
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:32,790
I stayed in Europe pretty much until
I was about 10 but I come back to the

226
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:36,660
states every year or so.
We settled down in Denmark,

227
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,520
1971

228
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,600
Denmark and Danish culture
are very wholesome.

229
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,000
It's a great place to grow up,

230
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:54,001
but of course there's an underside
to in the 60s and in my case,

231
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,470
the late sixties and seventies it was
cool in certain aspects and wasn't so

232
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:00,161
cool.
And others,

233
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:04,840
you had all these people fucked
up on drugs and all the free love.

234
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:06,460
Everybody's fucking everybody.

235
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,880
And it's not really the best
environment for a kid to grow up in.

236
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,060
And as cool as some of the things,
and a lot of the people were,

237
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,050
a lot of them were,

238
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,370
at least some of them
were just fucking lost.

239
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,110
And Yeah, all the kids were
wild. What do you expect? I mean,

240
00:16:23,111 --> 00:16:26,380
we were just in an imitating the grownups,
so as a result,

241
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,020
I was getting laid and doing
all kinds of other crazy shit.

242
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:32,800
Before I'd even reached puberty,
you basically had a bottle,

243
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,210
a little kids just going off.

244
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,240
You got all these hippie kids
with their hippie parents,

245
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,710
seeing all kinds of craziness.

246
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:41,980
Adults running around naked
people doing drugs being insane.

247
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,460
That shit rubs off on kids.
Damn.

248
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,820
Yeah. Did you completely think
that was normal at the time?

249
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,530
Was that just the way the world was?

250
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,140
Well, that's the way my world was. Um,

251
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:02,190
I didn't realize really that we were so
a different from the rest of society,

252
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:06,520
uh,
until

253
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,130
my parents tried to put me
into a regular school. And, uh,

254
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,060
of course I started getting fucked with
a lot by the kids because I had long

255
00:17:16,061 --> 00:17:20,710
hair and you know, I didn't,
I didn't really fit in and uh,

256
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,200
my parents looked like freaks and now is
when it really hit me. And it was also,

257
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,810
yeah, I went from being at that hippy
school to being in a very strict school in

258
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:31,240
Denmark, which was like real
old school and very rigid.

259
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:36,040
So it was total culture shock.
She was like, what the fuck,

260
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,090
you know?
And um,

261
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,930
so I started cutting school a lot and
going back to the free school to visit all

262
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:42,670
my friends there and just hang out.

263
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,630
And that free school, that's,
that's where you started is that,

264
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,200
that's where he started playing
for as much, you know, I mean,

265
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,100
I was always into music,
but that was really

266
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,040
the first place that facilitated
it. You know, like they,

267
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,690
that was one of the cool things
about that school was um, they really

268
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,780
pushed the arts,

269
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,950
whatever the kid's interests where they
would give you the ability to pursue

270
00:18:07,741 --> 00:18:11,340
that. Unfortunately,
they were also very lax.

271
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:15,300
So if like you didn't have the
interest in pursuing math or whatever,

272
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:18,150
they'd be like, oh well, you know, he's
just not interested in it. You know,

273
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:20,880
he wants to be a musician
and it's like, you know, as,

274
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,460
as we all know as parents is
like, no, fuck that. You need to,

275
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,570
you need to know how to do your math.
You need to know your shit.

276
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:31,410
You need to know how to use your brain.
You know, it's not just about, you know,

277
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,670
gratifying your artistic and creative
interests because that's not going to

278
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:39,900
always pay your fucking bills. Yeah.
So, no, but it was, it was cool. It was,

279
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:43,650
it was cool in certain ways.
Like I said, you know, they, uh,

280
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,150
my math teacher,
he was actually from the states,

281
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:50,400
he was from the Bronx and,
uh,

282
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,850
he was a jazz drummer
and played standup bass.

283
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:57,600
And he really was a big
inspiration on me musically.

284
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:01,460
And so, you know, it gave
me some tools, you know,

285
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,130
that came in handy later
in life. Yeah, for sure.

286
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,770
So you were listening to
actually got your first Gig then?

287
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,290
Like, like you were playing little
Santana covers kool and the gang.

288
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,740
Yeah, my school band was cool. Yeah,
no, they were fucking legit. I mean,

289
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:27,360
we were like, you know, funky stuff, you
know. I mean, we were plans, like I said,

290
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:31,170
um, my math teacher, he was one
of the band leaders. So, you know,

291
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,090
you've got a guy from the
Bronx who was a jazz dude.

292
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:35,400
He's going to be teaching all
these little Danish kids musically,

293
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:39,000
what's really going on. Right. Because
in Denmark at the time, things like,

294
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:43,440
you know, Abba was what was big, you know,
so, you know what I mean? So it was like,

295
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:45,900
what the fuck, you know? So, yeah,

296
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:50,901
my school was cool as far as music and
a counter culture and all that shit.

297
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:55,800
But then, you know, then well as, as
you maybe have seen in the book really.

298
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:59,880
Then when my mother of all people
turned me onto the sex pistols,

299
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:04,400
that's what really, uh, that
changed everything for me, you know?

300
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:10,030
Thanks mom. That was, that was,
that was an eye opener. Oh yeah,

301
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,670
the sex pistols. Oh yeah. Yeah. It changed
everything for me. And at that time,

302
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,170
like you got one second
here where you said,

303
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:19,200
I remember coming off stage and you're
playing with the band that I think the

304
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,960
school band at this point,
I remember coming off stage
one night and these girls,

305
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,890
no, yeah. Not, was hanging out
with, they were like, you know,

306
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,550
that lady you came with, which was
her mom, she's in the bathroom.

307
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:30,750
She's not feeling too good.

308
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,020
I went in the bathroom and my mom
was throwing up all over the place.

309
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,140
That kind of shit was a kind of come
down back to reality that I have to walk

310
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,040
your mom home. Yeah.
It's fucked up. You know,

311
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,040
little things like that, they stay
with you forever. But, um, you know,

312
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,300
to, to her, uh, she did,

313
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,550
she did sober up eventually and you know,
she's,

314
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,200
she sobered up for about in the
eighties to the day she died.

315
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,210
She was clean and uh,

316
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,313
you know,

317
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,970
Eh, you know, people fall victim to drugs,

318
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,300
to alcohol and sometimes it's hard
to pull yourself out, you know.

319
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,210
But eventually she did, you
know, unfortunately I had to
witness a lot of real, um,

320
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,590
ridiculous shit.
But um,

321
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,110
yeah.

322
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,590
You know, I don't think there's such
a thing as a perfect parent, you know?

323
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:25,280
Yeah, no, no doubt about that.

324
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,350
And your mom, she did, like you said,

325
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,440
she gets you the sex pistols out and
that they need, like you said in here,

326
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:36,880
you said, well that was that. Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,900
It's almost concerts. What I was saying,
here we go, go into your book here.

328
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,350
Until that point, I hung around
with all these little hippie kids.

329
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,710
I had long ass hair,
so we were really already little freaks.

330
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:53,190
We'd walk around the streets, people
would give us looks and trip out on us.

331
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,700
Our parents and teachers had long
hair and beards and shit like that.

332
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,060
But then punk rock came about and
this was more appropriate for me.

333
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,890
It wasn't all peace and love,
it was just more me.

334
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,140
The music was raw and the imagery
and the craziness appealed to me.

335
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,410
It was energetic and a big factor for
me was you didn't have to aspire to be

336
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:17,970
Jimi Hendrix.
She didn't have to be Carlos Santana.

337
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:21,110
So you listen to that music and you'd
say, you know what? I can just play it.

338
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:23,840
I can do this. You can play that, do this.

339
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,870
I can have fun and do this
shit like this is, you know,

340
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:30,520
you don't need to rack your brain
to figure out how to do this.

341
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:35,020
You could just do it.
You know your power cords on man,

342
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:39,360
you just need some Saturday,
man. That's all you need, man.

343
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,500
That's all you fucking mean.

344
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,710
It was funny is I always
tell people this about music.

345
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,970
If you go to a guitar
store anywhere in America,

346
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,360
and you put up a little flyer
in there that says, you know,

347
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:56,100
I need someone that can play every note
on the following three albums, you know,

348
00:22:56,101 --> 00:23:00,240
and you pick complex, you pick rush
and cart and there too, there'll be,

349
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,760
there'll be, you'll get 10 people that'll
say, yeah, I can play all that stuff,

350
00:23:02,761 --> 00:23:03,990
I'll play it for you right now.

351
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,210
But there's and all those guys,
I mean, a lot of those guys,

352
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:10,590
unless they have that thing,

353
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:13,470
unless they have that sincerity that
you're talking about and they have that

354
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:17,550
little spark of creativity,
it doesn't matter how technical you are,

355
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:18,630
if you don't have that heart,

356
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,790
you could be technically amazing and have
not one ounce of inspiration and your

357
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:30,070
fucking body, you know. And uh,
I mean, look, man, you know,

358
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,090
the Ramones were, you
know, some of the worst,

359
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:37,600
greatest musicians ever. You know,
those guys could barely fucking play.

360
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:40,810
And they wrote some songs, they wrote
songs that are still anthems, you know,

361
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:45,500
songs that you will still hear played at,
like major sports arenas or whatever.

362
00:23:45,501 --> 00:23:46,334
I mean,
you know.

363
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,950
Yeah. But you know, music's a fucking
weird thing man. It is. It is.

364
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,950
And uh, you had your first
band called little big boss.

365
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,800
Was that in reference to you? I'm assuming
he must have been years old. You know,

366
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,780
it must've been because the
other two guys in the band,

367
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,090
we were adults and they named the band.

368
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:08,300
So looking back they probably
named it after me cause I was like,

369
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:13,060
I guess already tired tyrant to play with.
You know,

370
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,650
you were playing drums at that point.
Yeah.

371
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,280
Hammering all the drums and
then you guys move back to, uh,

372
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,970
back to New York and you're going back
and forth, back and forth to New York.

373
00:24:22,971 --> 00:24:24,770
Yeah, me and my mom, we lived in Europe,

374
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,350
but we would come back every like year
or year and a half or so to see my

375
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:33,290
grandparents and my aunts and stuff.

376
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,670
And so we always had that connection to
New York. We always came back and I know,

377
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:38,480
and I,

378
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,190
I was here during all of the pivotal
moments in history in New York. Like,

379
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,850
you know, I remember son of Sam, which
was huge if you were here, you know,

380
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:50,630
I remember the blackouts, which
were also huge. If you hear,

381
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,930
I remember the garbage strike, which
was also insane because you had like,

382
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:59,330
you know, 20 foot mountains
of garbage every fucking
where, I mean the city stank.

383
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,040
I mean,
you know,

384
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,640
like I remember all the
madness of New York.

385
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,700
I mean I moved back here for good and 79,

386
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,090
like I guess January or
February of [inaudible] 79.

387
00:25:11,091 --> 00:25:12,650
I mean it was like the weeks it died.

388
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,200
Actually the stimulators we're supposed
to play Max's the one weekend that he

389
00:25:18,201 --> 00:25:22,400
was playing and he died before
the show. But um, yeah, you know,

390
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,130
it was a much different place back then.
You know, you guys know, you know, but um,

391
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,310
you know, a lot of people who've only
been here over the last 20 years,

392
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:35,160
they have no clue if it
is a different place. And,

393
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,340
and I mean, you know, in,

394
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:42,341
in the book you got crazy
pictures like you and Andy Warhol.

395
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,410
Yeah. Cause you were just your, your,

396
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:48,710
it was your aunt Denise that
was running with them? Well, no,

397
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:52,790
actually he that or is that just a ran?
My mom actually knew him.

398
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:57,320
She had been in one of his movies when
she was young when she was like 15 or

399
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,240
something.
And um,

400
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:02,510
that picture was just
taking it at the class show.

401
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,320
Like I used to run into people like
him at different clubs and stuff.

402
00:26:06,321 --> 00:26:09,490
This was the backstage at a clash gig.
The first time they played in New York.

403
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,150
You look like you're about 10. It was a,
I was actually 12 in that picture. Um,

404
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,350
but yeah, I mean I was at all
the clubs all the time, you know,

405
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:22,670
I mean it was actually,
it was a, you know,

406
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,770
kind of weird, you know,
thinking back on it. Cause like,
I mean, when I, when I, um,

407
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,970
I did a thing with Anthony Bordain awhile
back and he was like, you know, he,

408
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:31,371
he's like,

409
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:35,470
I remember standing in front of clubs
like Max's and trying to get in and you

410
00:26:35,471 --> 00:26:35,920
know,

411
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,460
here come this like 12 year old kid and
just like walk through the fucking door.

412
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:44,040
Like the bouncers were just like, let
him in. Like, you know, he belonged in

413
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,660
there and I'm like, what the fuck?
Why the fuck is this child here? Like,

414
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,640
who let him in and who the fuck is
he and why are they serving him?

415
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:55,240
Like he's the fucking mayor,
you know? And uh, you know,

416
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,060
thinking back and it's fucking
little strange, you know, I mean,

417
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:04,470
I was, I was the youngest kid that you
around on the club scene back then.

418
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:09,030
And then, you know, as
time went on, you know,

419
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,920
my band, the stimulator has really
had a lot to do with it. The,

420
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:16,860
the crowds at the show has started
getting younger and younger because like,

421
00:27:16,861 --> 00:27:19,890
you know, we started pulling a
very young following, you know,

422
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:23,070
go figure 12 year old in the band.
And um,

423
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,020
people like the Beastie boys,

424
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,410
they started coming to see it before they
were the Beastie boys. They were like,

425
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:30,210
they were just fans of ours,
friends of mine,

426
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,910
they were like some of my
best friends growing up. And,

427
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,200
and then a lot of other people who went
on to start a lot of the first wave of

428
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:44,700
New York hardcore bands were fans of
the stimulators kids who were all like,

429
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,550
you know, in their early teens
when they used to see us play.

430
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,070
And then they went on to start a
lot of the bands that, um, you know,

431
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,170
set off that. Now how long did you
play with the stimulator for? Uh,

432
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,570
I only played with them
from like 79 to like 80,

433
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,190
maybe the beginning of 81.

434
00:28:05,191 --> 00:28:09,540
And then I was done with it because
at that point I had already, you know,

435
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,240
the bad brains had come to
New York and I was already,

436
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:16,230
and I was all that first hardcore
that came out from, you know,

437
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,520
black flag circle jerks,
minor threat.

438
00:28:18,521 --> 00:28:21,900
And of course bands like discharge
from overseas, from England, you know,

439
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:24,680
and all that shit was starting to really,
um,

440
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:30,710
take over my, my, uh, my soul.

441
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,110
And, uh, so I was like, you know what,

442
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:35,810
I can't play with the fucking steaming
as anymore. That shit is too poppy.

443
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:39,890
It's too, like, it's happy. It's
just not, it's not where I am.

444
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,050
And at that point, I
had already, you know,

445
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,620
the life I was living on the
streets and the wife that, uh,

446
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,990
the other band members were
living was not really the same.

447
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,360
I was just hitting my teens.

448
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:59,040
And as we all know, that's when
the problems begin, you know,

449
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,350
that's when you start
getting in trouble. So, yeah.

450
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,550
And the music that I started
writing really reflected the, um,

451
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,100
the feelings that, uh, that I
was having. And, uh, you know,

452
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:16,980
the cause of the, not just the
environment but just, you know,

453
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:21,550
everything leading up to that point
had, had created this person. Yeah.

454
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,370
And, uh, and it was a really
violent neighborhood. Yeah.

455
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,690
It was a really violent neighborhood
and I ate a lot of shit for being white.

456
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,840
And, um, which is ironic
because, you know,

457
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:33,510
I'm according to Minuchin
and I'm Cherokee and Choctaw,

458
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:36,690
but if you look at me especially, you
know, in all Puerto Rican neighborhood,

459
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,650
I'm a white boy, you know, so I
really ate a lot of shit. I really,

460
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,180
you know,

461
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,180
until I started fighting and
actually started getting more,

462
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,190
I hate to say it,
but it started getting more violent.

463
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,380
That started to earn me a
little bit of respect. And, uh,

464
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,720
I guess the fear and the credibility kind
of went hand in hand. Like when people,

465
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,910
you know, people knew that
they couldn't fuck with me.

466
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,070
I started getting respect and,
um,

467
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,030
I don't really think that's a really
healthy for a young mind to associate

468
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:19,440
popularity with violence and aggression,

469
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,670
you know?

470
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,480
Yeah. And I mean New York at that
time and like you said, and I,

471
00:30:24,481 --> 00:30:28,110
I used to come down to New York
sometimes when I was younger and it was

472
00:30:28,111 --> 00:30:31,260
completely different, you know,
in the, in the mid eighties.

473
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,350
You were there earlier than that.
But for me in the mid eighties,

474
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:36,540
when you'd come down here, it
was completely different. I mean,

475
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:41,420
we're sitting here right now in times
square times square was nuts, man.

476
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,580
There was like, you take two every two
steps, somebody to be offering you drugs,

477
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,390
you know, I used to come here when I
would cut school and just watch people get

478
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,530
pickpocketed watched the hookers turning
tricks and the guy is selling drugs and

479
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:55,740
the people getting into trouble
and yeah, it was, it was,

480
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:01,020
it was a fucking free for all. It's
really, and where you were living,

481
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:05,160
you were living here were strict. Yeah.
Was [inaudible] it was way worse. I mean,

482
00:31:05,161 --> 00:31:07,650
I was talking to ist the other day,
we were talking about,

483
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,570
about, you know, some of our experiences
and uh, just in my area alone,

484
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:16,200
I mean there was about five or six
gangs within the, you know, 10,

485
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:20,040
15 block distance,
you know,

486
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,160
everything from the Hitman
on my block who were,

487
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,050
were fucking really out of control and
to the hell's angels on Third Street who

488
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:31,670
back then were like
legitimately no fucking joke.

489
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,440
I mean,

490
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,650
you know,
I mean,

491
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,610
I can tell you some fucked up
stories, but you know, you could,

492
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,060
he told me he fucked up stories too.
So where does that go? It goes into uh,

493
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,490
you know, uh, it's just,
it's, it's hard to, uh,

494
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,030
if people go to New York now, it's just
completely different. Yeah, it really is,

495
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:54,480
man. It's, it's impossible
to really get it. I mean,

496
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:59,481
the best thing you could do is look at
old movies that Kinda tried to capture

497
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:00,510
that.

498
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,590
Then you got some pictures in the book
that show the neighborhoods and there you

499
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:08,340
can tell, you can tell what they look
like, a war zone. I mean, I wouldn't know,

500
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:11,730
but they look as close to what
they looked like a war zone.

501
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:15,510
You can take it from me on that one.
Looked like a war zone. I mean, dude,

502
00:32:15,511 --> 00:32:19,750
I was living in a squat. We literally
had no running water, no windows, no.

503
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,960
How old were you when you like
moved out? I, when I was like 14,

504
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:25,831
you know,

505
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:29,070
because basically I was getting into so
much trouble in school that they were

506
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:30,810
about to basically take it

507
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,440
from my mother and put me in
like Spotford and I was like,

508
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:39,840
fuck this, you know, I had
lost interest in school and,

509
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,250
and all that shit. Yeah.
It's actually funny. I was
something I wanted to tell you.

510
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,084
Um,

511
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:48,110
when I was 15 actually just right down
there and there was a recruiting center,

512
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,860
army, marines, Navy, the
whole bit. And I was 15. I,

513
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:57,120
I tried to enlist in the marines,
you know, cause like I, I,

514
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
at that point I was already,
I was very,

515
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,060
I guess I had a lot of pent up aggression,
you know, and I was just like, oh,

516
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,190
I just want to fucking, you know,
I probably shouldn't say this.

517
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:10,580
It probably sounds bad for the military,
but I just wanted to kill this one.

518
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,960
I just wanted to fucking kill.
And I wanted it to be able to,

519
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,010
like, I just was so fucking, ah, you know,

520
00:33:19,011 --> 00:33:22,310
and it didn't help that my mother
was a hippie. So, you know, just,

521
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:25,880
it's natural for a teenager
to rebel against everything
their parents believe in.

522
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,080
I mean, I had like fucking recruiting,
you know, catalogs and shit under my bed,

523
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:32,900
whereas most kids probably had,
you know, their playboys and shit.

524
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:34,350
Like my mom would find my ribs,

525
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:40,000
every critic shit instead of like
holding up the fucking, you know, Ben,

526
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,980
I was
raised by sudden to me,

527
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:45,450
no soldier get on their
fucking hippy fucking,

528
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,700
there's, there's a lot of guys
in the military. So I'm like,

529
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:53,660
fuck this. Through the years, you're
100% right, Chris, through the years,

530
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:56,750
there's so many guys in the military and
you meet some guy and you're like, hey,

531
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,700
how's it going? And you, you know,
you learn their last name at first,

532
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:02,270
but then you know, you get to know him a
little bit and you're like, you know, oh,

533
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:05,450
what's your first name? And they'll
be like, oh, my first name is rainbow.

534
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,620
My first name is, you know,
ocean. And then they go,
yeah, my parents were hippies,

535
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:14,780
you know, and, and so many kids
rebelled against their hippie parents.

536
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:20,090
I'm going to [inaudible] I'm going into,
in the seal teams,

537
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:24,290
that's a very common, so you're 100%
right. It's a good way to rebel.

538
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,770
And I even say this, you know, for me,
you know, hardcore was a rebellion. And,

539
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,080
and going in the military, for me, it was
a rebellion against the norm. You know,

540
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:37,730
was everyone's going on a, I'm going
to go be a Hippie, smoke dope, uh,

541
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,580
go to college, get a
job. And I was like, no,

542
00:34:40,581 --> 00:34:45,410
I'm going to go be a commando and
just get after it. And Fuck you. So,

543
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,230
you know,
it's fucked up because it's like,

544
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:53,450
had I followed those instincts,
you know, I mean, you know,

545
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,360
in some ways my life would have been
probably a million times better.

546
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:01,600
I know how to add a
lot more, you know, uh,

547
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,580
discipline.
I would have had a lot more focused.

548
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:07,430
I would have had more positive
shit, you know, going on.

549
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,620
I would learn some skills and shit,

550
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:12,530
but at the same time I wouldn't have
fucking written age aquarelle I wouldn't

551
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:16,910
have written best wishes. I wouldn't have
influenced people like you would it be,

552
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:21,080
you know, to go above and beyond what
the fuck I could ever fucking try to do.

553
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:24,310
You know? So it's like, I feel
like in, in my own way, I,

554
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:28,820
I managed to do my service to,
you know,

555
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,670
humanity if you will. You know. Although
it was a disservice and a lot of ways,

556
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:38,040
because I did inspire a lot of people that
do a lot of really fucking wrong shit,

557
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,450
you know? But, but nonetheless, the
inspiration that the, it was real,

558
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,201
it was genuine.

559
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:46,740
I think that's why a 30 years later
people still give a fuck about that record

560
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,750
and people are still out making
money on that record and you know,

561
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,550
people still cover songs off
that record. You know? And,

562
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,480
and it's funny cause I
was telling you earlier,

563
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:01,230
he's mean that lineup that played on
that record only lasted for one fucking

564
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:05,830
record. You know, it's amazing
how short it is a long time,

565
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,590
you know, and it's like, and you know,

566
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:11,670
it was something special because still
now 30 years later people are still

567
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,930
talking about it and not many people
can say that based on one fucking album.

568
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:19,620
Yeah. You know, so it's good shit.

569
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,863
Okay,

570
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:26,480
I got it. I'm just going to go like you
were talking about your neighborhood,

571
00:36:26,481 --> 00:36:31,481
this is just kind of a sample of what
you were living around and in back to the

572
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:37,760
book, I remember one night lying there
hearing some chick down the street getting

573
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:41,660
raped. Yeah. And knowing there
wasn't really nothing to do.

574
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,190
It was like a helpless feeling.
You knew that if the cops got called,

575
00:36:46,191 --> 00:36:49,040
it wouldn't matter because they probably
wouldn't show up. And if they did,

576
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:51,890
it would be too late and they
probably wouldn't find her. Yeah.

577
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,600
One night my mother's then boyfriend got
the tip of his nose almost shot off by

578
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:01,160
a zip gun. He has a scar to this
day, just because he was white,

579
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,770
looked a little freaky and
was walking down our block.

580
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,050
I remember coming home one
night and my aunt and my mom,

581
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,120
my aunt and an Gustafson,

582
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:15,620
the stimulators basis got jumped by six
dudes with golf clubs and shit trying to

583
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:17,270
pull her guitar out of her hands.

584
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,690
You don't really think about a group
of guys jumping two chicks and a kid,

585
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,560
but that shit happened. They didn't
give a fuck. You've got to figure,

586
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:27,470
a lot of these guys would hang
out and huff glue and shit.

587
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,590
And when you have glue and
you smoke a lot of dust,

588
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,630
you get pretty grim and lean
towards the violence. Yeah.

589
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,140
So there's your, there's your
surroundings, there's your environment.

590
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,270
Yeah. I mean it's, you know,
it's, I'll tell you, man,

591
00:37:44,271 --> 00:37:45,290
it's,
it's a,

592
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,390
okay.

593
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,960
It's almost harder to hear
it being read back to me now,

594
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,110
especially in your voice. But,
uh, but it's like, you know,

595
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,500
it's real and eh,

596
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:06,430
it brings back a serious
emotional response in me.

597
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,293
You know,

598
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,300
you know, as I was reading that, I was
just thinking of myself because you and I,

599
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:15,020
you know, in the scene there was
always guys that had dogs, right?

600
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,510
Pit Balls, everyone had pimples.
And as I was reading that, you know,

601
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:24,100
you and I both know if you take a pit
bull and you bring it up and you beat it

602
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,440
and you've torture it and you heard it,

603
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,920
that dog's going to be
a mean evil bastard.

604
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,160
And if that dog's brother can get brought
up and get fed and get care of and you

605
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,220
know, sleep, it gets treated
good and that, that dogs
and grow up and be nice and,

606
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,330
you know, just thinking, you,
you take a person, a human being,

607
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,520
and you put them in an environment where
that's what they're living with and

608
00:38:45,521 --> 00:38:47,230
that's what they're seeing
and that's what's around them.

609
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,440
They're going to tend
towards that direction. Yeah.

610
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,720
And it's gonna be hard to
break out of that shit.

611
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,220
It is, you know, and, uh, it's, you know,
look around at the world, man. You know,

612
00:38:57,221 --> 00:39:01,900
look at all the, all the fucking
ghetto was everywhere. Look at all the,

613
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,640
you know, all the, you know,

614
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,950
a lot of people don't get outside of this
country, you know, they're live here,

615
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:13,330
so when people don't realize
how well they have it.

616
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,560
Yeah. Yeah. And even, you
know, I used to laugh,

617
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,590
I was talking to my friend Melly
Mel and uh, we were saying,

618
00:39:23,591 --> 00:39:26,560
I was saying, you know, I
don't even understand what
the fuck's up with all that.

619
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:30,190
Like West Coast Gang Bang and shit. I
mean, these guys, they, first of all,

620
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,660
they don't even have to deal with winter.

621
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,460
The second fall,

622
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:40,630
they all got like yards and garages
and fucking barbecues and Shit.

623
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:46,370
Like we grew up in like apartments with
fucking rats and roaches and you know,

624
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:50,600
concrete everywhere.
And you know,

625
00:39:50,601 --> 00:39:53,810
what the fuck are you so pissed about
that you need to go and shoot at each

626
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:57,500
other and kill each other? You that
fucking bored. Like, it's just,

627
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,443
you know,

628
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:04,450
it is an interesting dynamic here
in New York City the way it is.

629
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,200
That's why I didn't touch it. I mean,
even now that it's like, you know,

630
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:13,850
soft his fucking baby shit, it's
still intense. Yeah. You know,

631
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:18,890
I like, I just, I feel
confined when I'm here,

632
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,800
you know, now, now, now,
now that I've grown up,

633
00:40:21,801 --> 00:40:23,180
when I come here and
I live in [inaudible],

634
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,430
I live in California and you're right,

635
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:30,490
I got a yard and I got a barbecue and my
neighbors have yards and they say good

636
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:36,840
morning. And it's like, you just,

637
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,430
you have space. Space is a real
thing. And animals, you know,

638
00:40:40,431 --> 00:40:42,650
you can't put an animal, a little
tiny cage, they get pissed off.

639
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,830
And that's what we do with 8 million
people in New York and put him in a little

640
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:50,510
tiny cages. But it's her getting
pissed off, especially when, you know,

641
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:55,320
the good majority of them were
broke as shit. Yeah, yeah.

642
00:40:56,090 --> 00:41:00,350
Uh, but this whole time as you're
doing this, at the same time,

643
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,280
you're still, you're listening to music,
you're going to shows all the time.

644
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,210
And like you said, the bad brains
show up. You know, that was a change.

645
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,270
That was a game changer. They were
as groundbreaking as far as for me.

646
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:18,610
They, they sh they rocked my world
as much as like the sex pistols.

647
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:22,200
Like they, it was like all of a sudden
it was a new chapter. I, uh, you know,

648
00:41:22,201 --> 00:41:24,620
and the way you wrote, you wrote about
the bad brand. So the bad brands,

649
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:25,341
for those of you that don't know,

650
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:30,341
it was a band from DC and they
were pivotal in changing music.

651
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:33,190
Really a generation of music,
new,

652
00:41:33,191 --> 00:41:35,270
there's all kinds of bands
that referenced them,

653
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,130
like big bands and reference a bad brands.

654
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,010
But here's what you said about
the bad brains. It wasn't
just one thing. Go ahead.

655
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:45,470
For those who don't know. They were
not only one of the innovators of,

656
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,510
of what we call hardcore punk,

657
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,850
but they were all black and they
were from DC and it, you know,

658
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:55,670
there was not many
black kids on the scene.

659
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:58,370
There always was black kids on the seat.
It was always Puerto Rican.

660
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,960
It was always everybody,
you know, we always,

661
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:01,940
it was always mixed
diversity on the scene,

662
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:06,410
but they were like the best.
They were the tightest,

663
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:09,770
they were the best. They were the
fucking, they were this shit man.

664
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,110
And a lot of times when people
first heard their first 45 you know,

665
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,950
just because of the style of the music,

666
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,130
people didn't even know they were black
and they'd go see them and be like,

667
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,980
Oh shit, these guys are black now
that may not seem like a big deal.

668
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:26,780
Now we're talking about fucking 1980 yeah.
You know,

669
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:29,480
and yeah, they would just the
fucking, they were the shit man.

670
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,030
And then they got into
Rastafarianism and that, you know,

671
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:34,070
even further made it even more bizarre.

672
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:38,420
A bunch of fucking rosters from
DC plan hardcore. You know,

673
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,910
what the fuck is that?
And playing it better than everybody.

674
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:45,590
Like fucking smoking
motherfucker. Yeah. You know, uh,

675
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,980
you know, I think if you've got to
see the bad brains back in the day,

676
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
you're lucky.
I mean,

677
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:55,750
I remember seeing the bad
brains and just being, you just,

678
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,990
it was just sick.

679
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,740
It'd be like seeing James Brown back
when he had Bootsy Collins on base,

680
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:03,310
like back in the old,
like when he was like all over the,

681
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,120
I always used to like an HR to Lake James
Brown meets Johnny Rotten. You know?

682
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,920
Here's what you said back to the book.
You hear a lot of crazy stories about HR.

683
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:15,830
Hr is the,
the singer from the bad brains,

684
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,990
throat in the bad brains.

685
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,580
But as crazy as HR can act at times,
back in the day,

686
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:24,710
he was inspirational beyond belief.

687
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:29,690
He in the bad brains had the entire New
York hardcore scene, hardcore scene talk,

688
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,660
talking like fucking Jamaicans.
For the longest time,

689
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,140
everybody was like firebrand and
blood clot. That's hysterical.

690
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,850
It's like the mob.

691
00:43:37,851 --> 00:43:41,300
We're so heavily influenced by them that
the bass player started growing dreads

692
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:42,470
and wearing a Rasta hat.

693
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,700
A whole contingent of white rosters
started popping up on the hardcore scene.

694
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,100
They took things to another level.

695
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,710
It was impossible not to be
inspired by the bad brains.

696
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,240
The only way to describe HR would be like
James Brown meets Johnny rotten meets

697
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:58,940
Bob Marley.
He was such a dynamic front man.

698
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,080
Hr could do a standing back flip and
land right at the end of the song,

699
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,640
nail it right at the last beat. It was
like, oh my God, did he just planned that?

700
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,400
I remember one time at a seven,

701
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,760
which was a tiny club within the
first two minutes or so of their show,

702
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,720
he had already knocked the
sheet rock ceiling out and
bent the mic stand in half.

703
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,130
The amount of explosive energy that
would come out of that motherfucker.

704
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,700
You couldn't help but be blown away,

705
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,750
especially since we were all young and
here was this guy that was in shape.

706
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,680
He used to be a javelin thrower back
in high school. He was always athletic,

707
00:44:30,681 --> 00:44:33,780
so he had a bunch of scrawny punk rock
motherfuckers and then this dudes up

708
00:44:33,781 --> 00:44:38,130
there that was an athletic powerhouse
going completely ape shit and he could

709
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:42,570
sing his ass off and he could hit notes.
Hr came out there with a purpose,

710
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:46,710
like he was on a mission. Every show
I saw of theirs back then was amazing.

711
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,040
I remember when I saw him up in Boston
one time and he was like going, he,

712
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,090
there was, I guess like fire
pipes or whatever, uh, uh,

713
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:59,520
sprinkler pipes and he's leaping up and
swinging on those things and jumping off

714
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:02,730
into crowd. It was nuts.
He was a motherfucker

715
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:07,780
man. He spent half the show in
the crowd like he was. Yeah.

716
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:13,520
You know, you can't, you
can't, he just can't even,

717
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,260
you know. Yeah, man, they was something

718
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:24,230
everybody has that moment though, that,
that period where they really, you know,

719
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,900
well not everybody, but everybody
who's like intense, you know, you know,

720
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,870
you think about your life,

721
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:34,040
you can think of that one period
where you were just fucking point.

722
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,810
They were around.
I was like 16 and it ended like last week.

723
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,460
All right, well did last
[inaudible] some of us. But

724
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:51,920
yeah, there was a period when they
were just fucking untouchable and,

725
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:55,860
and you know, have you seen HR now?
Yeah, I've seen him over the head.

726
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:58,290
You actually like seen him talk to him?
I,

727
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:03,320
last time I spoke to him and he came out
to my house was probably around 2011 or

728
00:46:05,281 --> 00:46:09,990
2010 and you know, he's
definitely, you know, he's,

729
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,880
he's got some issues, you know, he, he has
suffered some serious, so he has like, um,

730
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,470
mental issues, you know, I mean, I
don't know what his diagnosis is.

731
00:46:19,471 --> 00:46:21,940
I'm not going to stand here
and pretend to know, but it's,

732
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,220
but you can tell there's a clear
change that that guy from the guy,

733
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:33,330
now there's something that is definitely
a psychological difference, you know,

734
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:37,620
and I, you can't just blame it
all on drugs because, you know,

735
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,210
some of us have done plenty of them and
they're fine. So I mean, some, you know,

736
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,660
there's something, you know, and, and
it's really, it's really sad. You know,

737
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:50,430
their plants, I don't know. I don't know
when or what they're doing and playing.

738
00:46:50,431 --> 00:46:53,610
I mean, and God bless them, you
know, I mean a doctor, no, you know,

739
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:57,360
he suffered a stroke and a heart attack
and he had to like learn how to use his

740
00:46:57,361 --> 00:46:59,980
hand again and, and everything.
I actually did a benefit, uh,

741
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:05,030
show us a record that's
available on pledge music.

742
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:08,100
It's the only place you can get it.
You can't even buy it in stores. And,

743
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:12,370
and 48% of the music goes to help
him just help him also, you know,

744
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:16,550
to whatever he needs help with. You know,
cause God knows he's pledged music. Yeah.

745
00:47:16,551 --> 00:47:19,530
What do you search? Pledge,
pledge music. Harley Flanagan.

746
00:47:19,531 --> 00:47:21,900
And the song will come up.
It's the,

747
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,030
one of the songs is called friends
like you and um, but anyway, yeah.

748
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:29,860
I mean those guys were intense. I mean,
it will never be what it was, you know,

749
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,890
I'm, I'm glad that they're doing
their thing, you know, whatnot.

750
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,940
But I think my memory of them
is from that period. Yeah.

751
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,570
And you probably saw how
many times did you see that

752
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,500
it's unlimited because I have no idea.
I saw them so many times.

753
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:49,030
I saw them out on the west coast and

754
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:54,330
you know, excuse me. Yeah,
I saw him in Tiawana.

755
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,730
Oh really? Yeah. But HR wasn't with them,

756
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,200
so it was kinda like, oh cool.
But not that cool. No offense.

757
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:04,560
Other singers who were really
doing great dudes, great singers.

758
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:07,950
But it's really hard to follow
in someone's footsteps. I mean,

759
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,470
that was a rough hospital.
That's a rough fall shot.

760
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:15,290
So meanwhile you did a trip to England.

761
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,260
This is the first time
you saw skinheads before?

762
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:23,630
Well, I saw, I was getting hired,
I got my head shaved in Ireland.

763
00:48:23,631 --> 00:48:26,780
I had seen skinheads one
time before in London,

764
00:48:26,781 --> 00:48:29,280
but I didn't know what the fuck they
were. I was just like, what the fuck?

765
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:31,310
Like I could know that
there was something,

766
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,950
they had an interesting look
like they, you know, and,

767
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:38,190
but the shaved head thing was
what got me and uh, yeah. So I,

768
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:40,850
I met skinheads in England in the 70s,

769
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,440
but I got my head shaved in Belfast and 19

770
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,230
dean 80. And here's what they
told you, going back to the book,

771
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,500
I always remembered what
the Belfast Skins told me,

772
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,600
teach America about skinheads,

773
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:56,870
the first few friends of mine to shave
their heads and included Adam Yauch do

774
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,140
that from the Beastie boys and a few
others who weren't really skinheads in the

775
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:04,470
stereotypical thug way.
They just liked the look and the music.

776
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:09,860
I mean we were all into the early oily
style music cockney rejects and bands

777
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:12,600
like that even though it
wasn't really called oil yet.

778
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,830
The two tone thing was happening with
all the Ska bands jumping off like the

779
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:19,680
specials and selector and madness.

780
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:21,960
And they were all popular
with the skinheads early on,

781
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:25,260
but there still wasn't a
skinhead scene in New York.

782
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,490
Just a few friends of mine who were
up on it both in a couple of years.

783
00:49:29,491 --> 00:49:34,440
All that would change. So, obviously the,
uh, the, the typical person when they,

784
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:38,550
that doesn't follow the music scene
at least at, at a deeper level,

785
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,660
when they think skinhead, the
immediately think of sort of the, uh,

786
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:47,750
the branch that went off and, and
got the most press, which was the,

787
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:51,660
the Neo Nazi skinheads.
But the original,

788
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,970
the origins of the skinheads
is actually black dudes,

789
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:58,830
rude boys,

790
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:04,470
Ska bands like the specials and madness.

791
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:09,480
And that's kind of what you saw and,
yeah.

792
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,540
I mean, I actually talk about a
little bit of that in the book.

793
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:17,541
I give a little bit of the historical
information just to give people a clearer

794
00:50:18,271 --> 00:50:21,720
idea. Um, yeah. But, you know,

795
00:50:21,721 --> 00:50:26,610
the media always let latches onto
whatever is most sensationalistic.

796
00:50:26,611 --> 00:50:30,080
You know, they'd to always
grab the worst aspects of,

797
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,840
of what people are doing
and, um, you know, yeah.

798
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,850
You know, it's, you
got it, you know? Yeah.

799
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,600
Yeah. I mean, I'll,
I'll say one more thing.

800
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:43,740
In the New York scene had always been
more diverse than most hardcore scenes

801
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,250
that always been Spanish
kids, black kids, Asian kids.

802
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,400
A lot of the early New York hardcore
skinheads were Spanish. Yeah.

803
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:56,220
Mojer from agnostic front, which if you
don't know agnostic front is probably,

804
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:58,530
they might be considered like the,
Oh,

805
00:50:58,531 --> 00:51:01,950
they're definitely one of the biggest
sort of skin head bands from America.

806
00:51:01,951 --> 00:51:06,110
And they were absolutely the first real
like New York skinhead and you know,

807
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:08,700
I mean, but uh, yeah. You
know, and he's Cuban logic.

808
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,060
I mean Diego was Puerto Rican as was Jose
from the mob and so were a lot of skin

809
00:51:15,251 --> 00:51:18,210
heads that came around later.
Even back in the Maxxis days,

810
00:51:18,211 --> 00:51:20,070
you had the bad brains,
pure hell,

811
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:23,370
that influence or one of the first real
New York hardcore bands and they were

812
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,204
all black.

813
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,930
Yeah.
I think where you just pulled up,

814
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:28,570
I was just talking about the
diversity on the scene in New York.

815
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:32,210
New York has always been different
from other places as you know, you,

816
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,920
you know, it's one of the things
that's cool about it here. Yeah.

817
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:42,570
I could say, you could say it's fairly
diverse here in New York City. Fuck,

818
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,680
this has got to be one of them.
I bet you the, I don't know,

819
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:48,380
you'd have to look at this,
but in New York City,

820
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:51,330
one of the most diverse places in the,
on the planet,

821
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,560
it's as far as like different languages
spoken. I mean, one thing I noticed that,

822
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,423
you know,

823
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,840
you can eat any type of
food here by a people.

824
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,670
I mean,
we had moved here like three weeks ago.

825
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:10,520
That's one thing I always loved
about it here. Gangnam style, uh,

826
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:14,610
dumplings, dumplings,
dumplings in Sushi, served by,

827
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,380
by Gangnam style. Oh, actual guy. Oh.

828
00:52:21,390 --> 00:52:24,840
And meanwhile, you know, at this time

829
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,460
back to the book,
I was drinking a lot huffing glue,

830
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:34,290
taken pills and lots of LSD and
whatever else. So this whole time,

831
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:39,210
that's what just prevalent in the scene.
Drugs and New York was a very much,

832
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:43,710
um, are seeing like to, to get fucked up

833
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:48,210
in DC. They, where they
invented straight edge,

834
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:52,060
you know, they were, they were all
about being clean and sober and,

835
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,550
and God blessed them. And uh, you know,

836
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:58,670
that caught on like wildfire
and other places, you know, uh,

837
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:01,800
the straight edge movement
spread and whatnot.

838
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:06,280
And we always went the extreme opposite.
We were like, are we, you know,

839
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:10,990
they had a song, don't drink, don't
smoke, don't fuck. We used to sing,

840
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:15,490
you know, we've, we drink, we
smoke, we fuck, fuck you. You know,

841
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:20,290
and um, yeah, a bunch of fucking idiots.
You know what I mean? W you know,

842
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:26,250
unfortunately, you know,
at point in my life

843
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,130
and in the hardcore scene,

844
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:36,420
it was often cool how
fucked up you could be.

845
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,400
You know, and I'm sure it's
that way in a lot of the world,

846
00:53:40,401 --> 00:53:44,250
in a lot of youth culture and in a lot of,
you know,

847
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:48,390
cruise and gang culture and you know,
I don't mean to theorize,

848
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,700
but I'm going to do it a little bit
of philosophize with you. You know,

849
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,890
like cultures that back in
the day or some cultures,

850
00:53:55,891 --> 00:54:00,150
even today when you want
to prove that you are,

851
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,730
we'll sacrifice yourself
for the tribe a little bit.

852
00:54:02,731 --> 00:54:05,970
Like I'll go hunt that line or I'll go
out and do something that's hard and I'll

853
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:08,600
take risks for the group
and I'll prove that, that,

854
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:13,500
that I don't care what happens to me.
I should have been in the police.

855
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,410
I think that, hey, I'm going to prove
that I don't care what's happened to me.

856
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,730
Watch me drink this, watch me, shoot this,
watch me smoke this and whatever. No,

857
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:21,271
I agree.

858
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:26,271
I think that that instinct that's still
in us doesn't have a place to be used

859
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,430
properly. And I'll tell you where I got
that philosophy from in the seal teams,

860
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,110
man,
when I came in,

861
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,260
it was like the way that
you kind of proved that you
were tough was drinking and

862
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:45,660
fighting. Right. Take everything
to a fucking extreme. If
you fucking drank five,

863
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:46,610
I'll drink 10 yeah,

864
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,950
you fought to motherfuckers off
fight fucking five motherfucking.

865
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:53,040
That's what it was.
And when the war started,

866
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,610
did not like that stopped
cause that stuff still goes on.

867
00:54:56,611 --> 00:54:58,980
But it definitely in my mind,
in my mind,

868
00:54:58,981 --> 00:55:02,040
I was thinking and we still drank and
we still partied and got after it. But

869
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,110
it was different, man. It was different
to all of a sudden be saying, hey look,

870
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:09,330
you know what? I need to prove
myself as on the battlefield.

871
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:13,950
I need to be ready for that. And so I, I,
when I apply that to like all of society,

872
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:18,930
it seems like a young
kid like you who's 15,

873
00:55:18,931 --> 00:55:22,560
16 years old, how do you prove that you're
tough? How do you prove your manhood?

874
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,760
Oh, you think you can drink 12
shots? I'll drink 20 exactly.

875
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,090
Every thing.
And you know,

876
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:32,400
you talked about like the straight
edge moving and those guys,

877
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,970
it's interesting if they
took it to another level too,

878
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:39,240
they stopped fucking name until
they stopped paying then fuck.

879
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:42,090
And then how did they prove? How did
they then prove that they were tough?

880
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,330
They would go out and fight and beat
up people that were drunk and shit like

881
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,000
that. Well that's what started
happening in some scenes.

882
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:50,520
And then because like in DC,
those guys were always,

883
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,290
they always tried to be more
PC. They always had a little
bit more consciousness.

884
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:59,100
But in a lot of other places you
had bands like, you know, you got,

885
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,740
I got in trouble with Ian Mackaye

886
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,070
remember when removing Food
Gazi came on this. So for Ghazi,

887
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:11,040
one of my buddies from DC, this is,
and the dirty and one of those guys,

888
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:15,900
one of my buddies, one of my buddies
from DC, they sent me a demo tape.

889
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:19,860
He's like, Hey, this is, this is eons new
band and you're quite a few thousand. No,

890
00:56:19,861 --> 00:56:23,440
I was like, cool, that's
a great album. Great. Um,

891
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,950
and so we went and saw him in Brooklyn,
me and my boys,

892
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:31,900
we went down to Brooklyn Museum and we
went berserk because he wasn't feeling

893
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:35,560
it.
He had like longer curly hair and,

894
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,800
and he's standing there and he put it
like they play their first song and we

895
00:56:38,801 --> 00:56:43,420
just cleared out destroying everything.
He was like,

896
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:46,000
Hey,
I'm just trying to think of what he say.

897
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:47,680
So he knows I'm not bullshitting
if he ever hears this.

898
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:50,030
He said something along the lines of like,
let's leave her,

899
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:52,900
let's leave our machoism and
our egos at the door, you know,

900
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:56,380
if you're gonna dance, be
cool or something like that.
And so then I was like,

901
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,420
dude, what do I do now? I get
music, rocks, I want to break stuff.

902
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,330
And I couldn't,
so we just,

903
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:08,110
I remember when he started going that
route and you know what, God bless him

904
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,390
and you know,
and he has always had it

905
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:18,170
integrity. And as he,
as he matured, you know,

906
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,470
his his way of thinking.

907
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,480
Yeah. And you know, you gotta respect. I
mean, you held the line with what he did,

908
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,250
his record, he never sold out.
You know what hat's off for sure.

909
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:32,050
He's fucking legit man.
For sure.

910
00:57:32,051 --> 00:57:36,310
I got the first wreck
for him now at this time.

911
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:39,190
And you used to break his balls.
Fucking relentless Lee though.

912
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,020
But that's just the way I am. If I,
if I, if I like someone in respect of,

913
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:46,300
chances are I'm going to really fuck with
them whenever I have the opportunity,

914
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,490
you know, so yeah. Um, so fuck you.

915
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:55,410
Uh, the, at that time you,

916
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:58,480
you kind of came up with the name of the,

917
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:03,580
I actually came up with the Cro mags
name and you started like tagging

918
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:08,260
everything with the old match
and where you had a kick ass.

919
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:10,330
I was like,
when we talked about my first,

920
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,460
the hardcore band called
Bronson's children.

921
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,040
First thing we did no music
but we made tee shirts.

922
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:21,610
They can merchandise. So we,
you know, that's what we did.

923
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:23,263
And you were doing the same thing,

924
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,670
just different as you could actually
play music. And I was just, uh,

925
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:33,600
let me see where we're going with this
one. So you started, you started coming,

926
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:38,640
putting together the band and then things
started getting a little bit crazy.

927
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:45,550
You beat someone up who's some friend
to someone else and all of a sudden you

928
00:58:45,551 --> 00:58:47,530
heard that you had like
a price on your head.

929
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:51,560
That was actually before the Cro
mags. Really? Yeah, it was pre chrome.

930
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,810
It's like he made up the name. But you
were nothing. Yeah, that's actually why I

931
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,580
wound up,
I'm heading out to California.

932
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:02,890
I had to take a little break from my
neighborhood. Yeah, it was pretty intense,

933
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:07,030
man. This dude, I'm all right. There was
a gang on my blog called the hit man.

934
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,530
And this is back in,
you know,

935
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,260
I remember them from the seventies
through the eighties. I mean,

936
00:59:11,261 --> 00:59:14,980
this is when they still used
to wear colors, you know,
patches on there. In fact,

937
00:59:14,981 --> 00:59:18,220
the Puerto Rican gangs
looked more like bikers,

938
00:59:18,221 --> 00:59:20,950
like Puerto Rican bikers
without bikes back then.

939
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,980
Like they all had like patches and
jeans and like Mc boots and you know,

940
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:28,730
they'd wear like the f true pats and
total old school, you know, like,

941
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:34,550
you know, uh, wolf tails and shit,
you know, lack of for college.

942
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:35,500
This is like ridiculous shit.

943
00:59:35,501 --> 00:59:38,900
If you look on old youtube and then old
photos of New York gangs, it'd be like,

944
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,650
okay, that's what he's talking
about. Yeah. Anyway, yeah,
these guys were fucking,

945
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:47,540
they were no joke. And one of the
hit men was pig man and he, you know,

946
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:51,500
they did hits, they weren't called the
hit men, you know, because they, you know,

947
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,340
ro hit songs, you know,
they, you know, they,

948
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,690
besides selling heroin,
they, they did hits and, uh,

949
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:00,530
okay.

950
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:03,250
Pig Man.
I've known about him my whole childhood.

951
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:07,610
He was like a lower east
side myth. Like, you know,

952
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,090
everybody had heard of him but no one
knew. Ya know, cause if you saw him,

953
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:14,270
that was most likely the
last thing you saw, you know,

954
01:00:14,271 --> 01:00:17,750
but he would wear a pig's mask.
That's why he was called pigs pig man.

955
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:21,780
And he would pull up in his blue Nova
and fucking blast you with a shotgun.

956
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:22,820
And it was that simple.

957
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:28,510
And they actually kicked in a friend of
mine's door and put shots in people's

958
01:00:29,301 --> 01:00:30,890
mouths and guns to their heads.

959
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:35,120
Whereas Harley in one of the skinhead
apartments looking for me and they came to

960
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:37,070
my squat and,
uh,

961
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:40,490
pulled someone into a corner
and put knives to their throats,

962
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:45,491
which departments Harley in and pig man
was cruising by my friends with the mask

963
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:50,090
on and didn't see me.
So kept driving I guess.

964
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,450
So it was real. And uh, I'm like,

965
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,320
I was like fucking 15,
you know, I mean, I'm 15.

966
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:00,740
I got fucking pig man looking for
me. I mean, that's fucking no joke.

967
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:05,020
This is big man.
Motherfuck Gino Man.

968
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:09,470
And, uh, I'm like telling the locals,
I'm not black. I'm like, shit man.

969
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:11,750
And My mother lives on 12th Street.
We know what the fuck.

970
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:14,510
I don't know what about her.
I don't worry about your mom.

971
01:01:14,511 --> 01:01:17,390
Everybody loves your mom. This,
this, this not personal man.

972
01:01:17,391 --> 01:01:19,760
There's money on evolve,
you know, it's his business,

973
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:22,340
but you should get outta here,
man. You should hang low.

974
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:25,180
These are your four to Rican
brother is telling you this. Yeah,

975
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,010
I like the guys on the block.
Just people who knew me from school.

976
01:01:28,011 --> 01:01:31,490
Like people like my friend's uncles and
shit like that, you know, like dude,

977
01:01:31,491 --> 01:01:34,760
you should get the fuck outta here. So
I'm like, you know what, I think I will.

978
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,590
Yeah, just that's cause you beat
somebody up. Yeah, I used to,

979
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:43,610
I used to get in a lot of fights
and I used to also, you know,

980
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:45,940
okay,

981
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:48,880
yeah, I beat someone up. And
it turned out he was, uh,

982
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:53,920
it was this guy who was a one owner
of one of the after hours clubs.

983
01:01:53,921 --> 01:01:57,850
I'm the lower east side and a lot of
these after hours clubs like you know,

984
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:01,090
save the robots and the pyramid
and all these other places.

985
01:02:01,091 --> 01:02:05,230
They had like no that like they will the
late night freak clubs where everybody

986
01:02:05,231 --> 01:02:08,590
would go like to a six in the morning and
they would all be doing blow and doing

987
01:02:08,591 --> 01:02:11,530
coke. So I guess that's how they knew
the hitman because they all used to,

988
01:02:11,531 --> 01:02:14,680
all the club freaks used to buy all their
drugs from the Puerto Ricans and the

989
01:02:14,681 --> 01:02:15,041
neighborhoods.

990
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:18,340
So we were kind of fucking
up their business too because
we were like fucking up

991
01:02:18,341 --> 01:02:21,720
all the, all the new freaks that we're
starting to come to the Lori side,

992
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:24,660
all the new white people that we
were like, you know, fuck you,

993
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,540
we just made this motherfucking
neighborhoods safe now
you motherfuckers all

994
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:31,470
thank you. This is gang busters. Like
your just the flood is fucking fuck.

995
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:36,270
This is our neighborhood now. So
yeah, you know, I was an asshole.

996
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:39,510
I mean, I, you know, I have to admit
that, you know, looking back, if you know,

997
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,400
if you're ever going to man up, you have
to be able to say yes, I wasn't an or,

998
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,060
you know, but that shit.
Yeah, pig man was no joke.

999
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:52,260
And I went to California and the
shit died off. I came back, dude,

1000
01:02:52,261 --> 01:02:55,680
you went to California and I was reading
that part of the fucking, I said,

1001
01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:00,770
what in God's name is going
on to talk about the bats.

1002
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:07,650
Yeah, man, we were living in an
abandoned brewery. Uh, there was,

1003
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,870
you know, a couple hundred
kids live in there. Probably.

1004
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:14,450
We were all living in the actual vats
that they used to have the rubber coated

1005
01:03:14,451 --> 01:03:17,520
in square rooms, like with a man hole
to get in and out of. And you know,

1006
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:21,420
we were living in the Air Vance and yeah,

1007
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:24,360
it was fucking crazy man.
And everybody was fucked up on drugs.

1008
01:03:24,361 --> 01:03:27,680
Everybody was a runway. Everybody
was, you know, it was, um,

1009
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:34,020
what amazes me about the eighties
is the lawlessness, you know,

1010
01:03:34,021 --> 01:03:36,690
in New York and in San Francisco,
you know,

1011
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:40,560
like you could really get away with just
about fucking anything and they would

1012
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:45,000
be like,
no police involvement,

1013
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:49,050
no repercussion, you know, I mean,

1014
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:51,960
you'd get into a fight and the shit
could go on for a half a fucking hour,

1015
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:55,830
like from one area to another and back
and forth. You know the guns will fight.

1016
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,920
Yeah. Like, I mean, you would
fucking start fighting on avenue a,

1017
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:01,530
you'd end up on first avenue
over on seventh street,

1018
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:05,160
then back over to eighth street and
back down to avenue n and it's like mad

1019
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,250
screaming and you know,

1020
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:12,000
stabbings and bottles breaking
and no cops, you know,

1021
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,650
that it was like, you know,
I mean shit happens now man.

1022
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:19,470
You fart too fucking loud on the
street here and you got arrested.

1023
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,680
I just, so you're 15 years
old, you live in, in a, in a,

1024
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
in a vat in San Francisco with a
bunch of everyone's running away.

1025
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,110
Matt Crystal Meth, fucking shoot and
crystal left, right front and center,

1026
01:04:37,111 --> 01:04:39,150
drop in liquid acid in their eyeballs.

1027
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:48,960
How's that even like how do you process
that? And the other weird thing is,

1028
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:52,140
is like you're surviving, you're, you're,

1029
01:04:52,830 --> 01:04:55,470
you're getting food to somehow,
right? You're stealing food,

1030
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:58,110
shoplifting and panhandling
and mugging people,

1031
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:03,750
figuring it out, figuring it out.
And that's what everyone in this vat,

1032
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:05,280
these vans are doing. Yeah. Well,

1033
01:05:05,281 --> 01:05:08,520
I mean there was only a couple of us
that were out mugging people cause there

1034
01:05:08,521 --> 01:05:11,760
was only like me and mark dagger and
a couple of other people who were like

1035
01:05:12,030 --> 01:05:16,800
hardasses everybody else was either out
panhandling or turning tricks. You know,

1036
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,730
it was like you, you, you, you know,

1037
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:23,740
you were either out Mcginn someone
sucking a dick, begging for change,

1038
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,630
you know, and um, did you just think like,

1039
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,930
okay, this is what life is like?
Yeah. That's what life was,

1040
01:05:36,910 --> 01:05:40,150
you know. I mean, I remember like
eating at soup kitchens, you know,

1041
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:42,280
with like adults and I'm like 15.

1042
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:45,610
And that being weird and like almost
getting into fights with like dudes who

1043
01:05:45,611 --> 01:05:47,710
were like ex cons and you know,

1044
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,620
like dudes were just got out of
prison who were like to them,

1045
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:52,990
they were still in the prison lunch room,
you know?

1046
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,880
And to me I'm just like trying to,
you know, get some food, you know.

1047
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,630
And uh, yeah, it was, it was
pretty intense, you know, I mean,

1048
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:08,020
but to be fair, I had a great fucking
time, you know, I mean I had a lot of fun,

1049
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:12,820
you know, the debauchery, the violence,
the drugs. I had a fucking blast.

1050
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:13,810
What?

1051
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:18,580
I recommend any of it and know what I
wish it on my kids or my worst enemies.

1052
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:21,430
No. Did I have a great time? Yes,

1053
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,640
I did. How I fucking made it.
I don't know. But you know,

1054
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:31,450
I guess it's, I guess is that
like when people talk about, well,

1055
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:32,950
when people say to me,
Oh,

1056
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,800
I think this is the same thing cause I'm
sitting here going, how can that be fun?

1057
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,280
But I guess, yeah, no dude.

1058
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,080
People asking me about like being not
thinking about the most intense situations

1059
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:45,520
you've been in. It's like the
adrenaline, the fucking, ah, like dude,

1060
01:06:45,521 --> 01:06:49,090
the last time I got in like a real
fucking crate. No, not the last time.

1061
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:50,710
The third or fourth.

1062
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:54,190
The last time I got a really
bad violence situation,

1063
01:06:54,191 --> 01:06:57,490
like the one it's in the
book when I had like,

1064
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:01,780
I fucked up this dude who was in a gang
and the next thing I know I got like 30

1065
01:07:01,781 --> 01:07:04,350
dudes fucking coming after me with pipes,
bads pop up,

1066
01:07:04,351 --> 01:07:08,470
Bah smashing out our windows and I'm
running into the crowd of them to save a

1067
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:11,710
friend of mine now. She like, dude,

1068
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:16,120
I was fucking like high for like
a week off of the adrenaline.

1069
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,670
And then when I finally came
down and I was like, Whoa,

1070
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:22,660
what the fuck was that
man, I have died, you know,

1071
01:07:22,661 --> 01:07:27,640
but like for literally a week after
that shit, I was just like, yeah,

1072
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:32,830
you know, and, and you know, that's like,

1073
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,310
but that's the difference between
certain types of people. Like, you know,

1074
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:41,340
I will run into a fucking violence to
save a friend and a lot of fucking people

1075
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:46,870
that I grew up with,
we'll fucking punk out.

1076
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,440
I've seen people that I respected fucking
run and leave their friends behind and

1077
01:07:54,861 --> 01:07:56,230
there's some real pussy shit,

1078
01:07:56,231 --> 01:07:58,720
especially when they're trying
to be all bad ass skinhead.

1079
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:04,470
You ain't nothing but a
bitch, you know? And um,

1080
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:07,270
and hey man,
you know,

1081
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:10,210
and that's one reason why I'm really
fucking proud to be here. You know,

1082
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:11,500
because it's like you guys,

1083
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:17,610
one of the things I respect the most is
someone who will put themselves on the

1084
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:20,810
line for someone else.

1085
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:26,200
Like when you will put your own
life at risk for another person.

1086
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:31,430
There's nothing more admirable than that.

1087
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:37,090
So hats off to you guys and to
all all the military out there,

1088
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:42,350
you know, serving this country and
serving their brothers, their sisters,

1089
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:44,660
their families, and everybody,
you know, hats off, man.

1090
01:08:44,661 --> 01:08:49,070
It takes a lot of fucking balls and
I respect and I'm not, you know,

1091
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,230
even law enforcement,
you know,

1092
01:08:51,231 --> 01:08:55,350
and I'm not a big fan of the
police in many surf. I've,

1093
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:58,700
I've become friends with a lot of
cops since I started doing Jujitsu.

1094
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,850
Jujitsu changes a lot of things
for the policy. However, you know,

1095
01:09:02,870 --> 01:09:06,170
I still have my reservations,
but I respect again,

1096
01:09:06,171 --> 01:09:11,171
anybody who is willing to put their
life on the line for others and for the

1097
01:09:11,241 --> 01:09:15,680
greater good and you know,
and there's really nothing higher,

1098
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:17,400
you know?
Yeah.

1099
01:09:17,540 --> 01:09:22,540
Well like obviously I got my work with
the police and they're the same way,

1100
01:09:22,941 --> 01:09:25,430
man, they're there and
they got, they got the,

1101
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:28,470
one of the hardest jobs in the whole.
Look, I say that with, you know,

1102
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:29,960
a little bit tongue in
cheek, you know, I mean,

1103
01:09:29,961 --> 01:09:32,810
it's like I've grown up always being
on the shitty end of the stick when it

1104
01:09:32,811 --> 01:09:35,360
comes to the cops. And you
know, still to this day,

1105
01:09:35,361 --> 01:09:38,840
even like when I'm trying to get something
achieved and accomplished and I try

1106
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,220
to go to them for guidance,

1107
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:43,850
they still look at me like they want to
slap the cuffs on me more than fucking

1108
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:48,410
help me out, you know? So, you
know, but you know, some friends,

1109
01:09:49,030 --> 01:09:50,900
but I do understand,
you know,

1110
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,670
I what they deal with on a regular basis,
so I get it.

1111
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:59,690
But I also think that a lot of people
are attracted towards lines of work that

1112
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:04,130
give them a, a position where
they can abuse their position.

1113
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:08,360
You know, I think that happens in
human race though. I mean, it's not,

1114
01:10:08,361 --> 01:10:11,840
it's like a go do a ride
along with some cops, man.

1115
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:16,400
It is, I couldn't do it
man. The cops is just the,

1116
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,910
what they deal with on a day to day basis,
what it does to the brain, you know,

1117
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,650
hard ass job.
People don't understand.

1118
01:10:24,651 --> 01:10:29,330
I mean it's like there's a certain level
of, uh, you know, once you've seen some,

1119
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:34,160
some shit,
you're always on that edge,

1120
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:39,050
you know, and that fight, that
fight or flight, you know,

1121
01:10:39,051 --> 01:10:41,120
and unfortunately they
don't have the choice.

1122
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:45,060
They have no choice but to deal
with at a fight. So, you know, so,

1123
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:48,890
and they got to protect. You
don't have to, of course you see,

1124
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:50,990
oh all we always see the negative thing of

1125
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,650
trying to work within certain
guidelines and that makes shitty parts.

1126
01:10:55,690 --> 01:11:00,170
End of the time they're there going,
no, Hey sir, please put the bat down.

1127
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:03,310
Put the knife down. That's what
we're doing. Nine days, you know,

1128
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:08,130
socks to hard ass job harder. But
you know, again, I got, I, you know,

1129
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:12,020
I also got to play, uh, I gotta keep
my one foot grounded in the streets.

1130
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:14,070
I still have my you,
you were

1131
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:16,590
uh, yeah. You're conditioned. Yes.

1132
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:21,650
From your childhood that the man you are
is more on the other side here on the

1133
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:24,600
other side, man. Exactly.
On the other side.

1134
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,340
And so now that's how
you're conditioned us.

1135
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,880
Just like when they, when
they see you. Well, I don't
know if they see, see you now.

1136
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:37,500
Well, you know, things are a little
different now, but you know, hey,

1137
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,960
you know,
what the fuck are you going to do?

1138
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,790
Well, I'll tell you what I do when
the cops tell you to do something. Oh,

1139
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,970
I'd do it. I don't fuck around.
I'm like, look it up. No problem.

1140
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:53,850
No problem. That's how you make friends.
I see my stupid fuck. The feds were like,

1141
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:58,290
Yo, fuck that blah blah blah. It's
like fuck's wrong with you. Oh,

1142
01:11:58,291 --> 01:12:01,140
you had to do was say yes sir.
How fucking difficult does that,

1143
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:06,450
you know motherfucker, he
that stupid. Yeah. Um, man,

1144
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:09,840
we haven't even gotten to like
the chromatics yet. Have we? Who?

1145
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:13,470
The chromatics Oh yeah.
Like putting together the first album.

1146
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:16,380
You know what I mean?
Shit.

1147
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:19,253
So

1148
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,750
you guys finally get together here.
We go back to the book.

1149
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:28,010
It had been three years since Paris
and use of Paris. The guy was a,

1150
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:28,621
he was the guitar.

1151
01:12:28,621 --> 01:12:33,210
It's stars from the Cro mags hooked
up and started writing November 2nd,

1152
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:36,660
1984 and on February 16th,

1153
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:40,390
1985 the cro mags went into high five
studios on 27th street and Park Avenue in

1154
01:12:40,391 --> 01:12:43,500
recorded 12 songs.
The age of coral cassette,

1155
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:46,950
which has released on CD called
before the quarrel. Yeah.

1156
01:12:46,951 --> 01:12:50,970
That was the original version of the
album before we actually went and recorded

1157
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,680
the album,
age of coral.

1158
01:12:53,681 --> 01:12:57,690
So that's 84 that that's
going down. Yes. And

1159
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:01,950
that's a good recording.
I have that one too.

1160
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,170
I actually like it a lot better than
the album I was telling you before.

1161
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,920
I can't tell him I,
I,

1162
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,640
someone's granted my head that I
expect little things that aren't there.

1163
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:15,210
And so I, I I liked the first one
better cause I think it's this more raw.

1164
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:17,730
It is more,
we know that it's more explosive.

1165
01:13:17,731 --> 01:13:22,350
I think it's more true to what we
actually sounded like when we played live,

1166
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,860
you know? Yeah. The other thing,
the other one had, you know,

1167
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:29,160
a lot of productions shit that I
wasn't too happy about. But yeah.

1168
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:33,150
So now this is where now you think
the story has been crazy so far. Echo,

1169
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,910
I'll just throw you under the bus
right now. That story has been crazy.

1170
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:37,021
Now it goes,

1171
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:42,021
just takes another kind of what I consider
this an even more bizarre turned and

1172
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:46,470
everything we've talked about so far.
So going back to the book,

1173
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:52,110
I was into Vegetarianism, but it
took me a while to get into Krishna.

1174
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:53,760
At first,
John,

1175
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:57,580
this is the the singer from the Cro mags
or one of the singers that sang the cro

1176
01:13:57,581 --> 01:13:58,260
mags.

1177
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,580
John and me used to go to the trucks
where they served free food and comp comp

1178
01:14:02,581 --> 01:14:03,690
can square park,

1179
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:06,960
which wasn't big hangout back in the day
and everyone used to go there and hang

1180
01:14:06,961 --> 01:14:11,500
out. A lot of hardcore kids did.
I mean I was living in a squat,

1181
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:15,820
I was vegetarian, I had no money
and here was free vegetarian food.

1182
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:20,950
They also had a few preaching centers on
the west side that me and John used to

1183
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:22,270
go to to eat,

1184
01:14:22,570 --> 01:14:26,740
but still it took a while for to give
a fuck about what they were saying.

1185
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,710
I was there for the free food.
I wasn't looking for religion,

1186
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:32,590
I was just hungry and trying to survive.
We would always show up late.

1187
01:14:32,770 --> 01:14:36,730
John would tell us when the good time was
just to get the food after the reading

1188
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:37,690
and preaching and everything.

1189
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,330
But over time I really started
getting into the philosophy.

1190
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:43,480
In the beginning people didn't
take John and Christina. Seriously.

1191
01:14:43,660 --> 01:14:47,020
It was kind of something the
hardcore scene laughed at.

1192
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:50,440
But as my friends and me started getting
into Krishna, it started to change.

1193
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:55,310
So you guys started getting into
Hari Krishna? Yeah. Yes. Yeah.

1194
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:58,360
Which is pretty funny.
Looking back now,

1195
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,300
tell me the fundamental philosophies.

1196
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:04,880
I mean obviously Hari
Krishna's are vegetarian. Yeah.

1197
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,650
Cause they don't want to like hurt,
you know, animals. The actually,

1198
01:15:08,651 --> 01:15:10,990
it's more to it than that.
That's actually not why.

1199
01:15:10,991 --> 01:15:14,440
It's because now I'm going to start
fucking talking to all their shit.

1200
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:16,450
Well gimme a little bit of it.

1201
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:19,540
They only eat food that
are offerable to God.

1202
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:23,590
And you can't offer God a rotting
carcass to eat. Okay. You know,

1203
01:15:24,490 --> 01:15:26,050
there's, there's nothing that
has to do with like, hey,

1204
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:28,750
we don't want to hurt things. Oh
there's all this karmic stuff. You know,

1205
01:15:28,751 --> 01:15:33,610
everybody likes to, you
know, not make more Karma for
themselves, good or bad. See,

1206
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:36,560
that's what I'm saying, like this is why
this is why it gets more bizarre to be,

1207
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:38,233
yeah,

1208
01:15:39,330 --> 01:15:43,840
see that's the thing is with the amount
of Karma I had already hated myself.

1209
01:15:43,841 --> 01:15:47,100
I was not trying,
but this is where it gets even more fun.

1210
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,810
The up and twisted because you got me
and my friends who were like recovering

1211
01:15:51,850 --> 01:15:54,720
skinheads for lack of a better
way of putting it. You know,

1212
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:58,620
dudes who he used to go out and get in
like, you know, 20 fights in a night,

1213
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:02,580
you know, put 19 people in
Icu just because you know,

1214
01:16:02,581 --> 01:16:05,310
just walking from the east side of the
west side, what you look at it, ah,

1215
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,480
you know, fuck you out all night.
Just fucking wild and you know,

1216
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:12,810
and then all that shit with pig man and
this and that and God knows how many

1217
01:16:12,811 --> 01:16:17,660
other things, you know, how many
bodies I've found and came across and,

1218
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:21,390
and you know, how many, how much madness

1219
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,880
I had it experienced, you know, like
we were talking about, you should know.

1220
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,080
It's like sometimes,
you know,

1221
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,890
when you're dealing with life and
death on a regular basis, you know,

1222
01:16:31,891 --> 01:16:34,860
sometimes you're like, you know,
God, you start calling out the god,

1223
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:38,140
you don't even know what the fuck guide
is and you're just like, God, help me God,

1224
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:42,540
you know, please, you
know, guide me, help.

1225
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:46,980
It's this the call of f of desperation,
you know?

1226
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,990
And,
um,

1227
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:53,540
I would have never been into
Christianity and this and that. I just,

1228
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,550
it all just sounded like
a bunch of bullshit to me.

1229
01:16:55,551 --> 01:17:00,551
And here I was actually hearing some
things that made some sort of sense to my

1230
01:17:00,830 --> 01:17:05,780
teenage mind, you know, Karma, Ooh,

1231
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,650
you know, all these other things that
like were like resonating me, you know?

1232
01:17:09,651 --> 01:17:13,160
And it's like I needed that shit.
You know,

1233
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,940
I needed some sort of guidance. And had
I not had something like that, I mean,

1234
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:20,330
it could have been fucking Buddha, it
could have been whatever, you know,

1235
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,660
but I needed something that was
greater than you needed to some kind of

1236
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,850
guidance. And you're like,
I need guidance. I need
discipline. I needed hope. Hope.

1237
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:32,870
Yeah.
You know?

1238
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,040
And when I started going out to
their farm for a little while,

1239
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:37,820
like they were getting,

1240
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:41,720
we were getting up at like five 30 in
the morning and meditating and watching

1241
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:45,850
the sun come up and like it was
like this whole, you know, it

1242
01:17:47,940 --> 01:17:52,940
going from like being like hunted by
the gangs in my neighborhood to that.

1243
01:17:54,691 --> 01:17:55,680
It was just like,

1244
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:01,400
I can't even really explain
it. It really, it was like,

1245
01:18:04,590 --> 01:18:05,370
yeah,

1246
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:07,590
I don't know how to fucking put it
man. It was just like, it was like,

1247
01:18:07,591 --> 01:18:09,390
here I am at peace.
I was going to say,

1248
01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:14,160
it sounds like people might for
the first time like wow, you know,

1249
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:17,810
so that, but then the more I was
involved in it, the more I seen,

1250
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:22,740
you know that people in
religions in general or are
typically a bunch of fucking

1251
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:24,180
hypocrites,
you know,

1252
01:18:24,181 --> 01:18:28,560
you get a lot of people preaching a
lot of shit that they don't all fucking

1253
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:33,590
follow and all rules don't
really fit all people.

1254
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:35,160
You know,

1255
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:39,190
every human is different and not everybody
can follow the same guidelines. And,

1256
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:40,770
and when is,

1257
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:45,740
when did things start becoming just
belief in what the fuck is belief anyway?

1258
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,580
It's just what you choose to believe,
you know, unless it's like, this is real,

1259
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:54,180
you know, this is really cutting my face.
That's really blood. This is, you know,

1260
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:57,000
I really have to eat food and breathe.

1261
01:18:57,001 --> 01:19:00,420
Air Belief is just that,
you know,

1262
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:04,110
I know I still have,
you know,

1263
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:08,640
my spiritual inclinations.
I still believe in some sort of,

1264
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,580
I don't like to say the word God
anymore because I don't, I, I,

1265
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:20,510
I don't have that overview
that I know any fucking thing.

1266
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:22,250
I just know,

1267
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:29,460
I know I got a lot of love in my heart
for the people I care about and I know I

1268
01:19:29,461 --> 01:19:34,170
want to try to do good things. You
know, I've done enough bad things.

1269
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,010
Yeah.

1270
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,090
I'd like to try to

1271
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:42,280
prevent some people from
experiencing what I experienced.

1272
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:45,850
And at the same time I
would like to share the,

1273
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,260
the great experiences that
I had with people, you know?

1274
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:55,420
Yeah. Well, one of the, one of the
great experiences and one of the things,

1275
01:19:55,421 --> 01:19:58,690
the great things that you shared to
people is that that album, that album,

1276
01:19:58,691 --> 01:20:00,940
and we'll go to here, going back
to the book, the age of coral,

1277
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,430
some would call it one of the most,

1278
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:08,130
if not the most influential
New York hardcore and albums.

1279
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,470
It was recorded and mixed in under
100 hours over a 14 day period.

1280
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,460
January,
February,

1281
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:19,461
1986 at east side sound by Steve
Remote and Chris Williamson,

1282
01:20:20,581 --> 01:20:23,460
our manager and so-called producer.
But it was really Steve.

1283
01:20:23,461 --> 01:20:27,910
So 86 comes around and you guys put
together the age of coral. Yeah.

1284
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:32,280
This is the, the one that got released
on a big scale is like the first,

1285
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,690
that profile.
Yeah.

1286
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:38,750
It was probably one of the first hardcore
records to ever be put out on a real

1287
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:40,590
major label.

1288
01:20:40,591 --> 01:20:45,591
Like something that wasn't like
discord or w slash records or something

1289
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:50,880
underground. Yeah. And, and
now this is, you guys are,

1290
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:52,650
you guys are starting to get a big draw.

1291
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,810
I mean huge draws
outside of New York City.

1292
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,080
We were starting to tour at this
point and doing, you know, we,

1293
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:02,850
our first big break was touring
with Motorhead and then we got, uh,

1294
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:07,290
you know, we went on to play with many
other metal bands at around that time.

1295
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:11,820
The whole crossover thing. Yeah. For
those of you that don't know crossover,

1296
01:21:11,821 --> 01:21:12,930
when he's talking about that,

1297
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:17,931
that's the crossover from hardcore
to metal and kind of combined,

1298
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:21,990
it was really want to have a metal
heads started discovering hard. Right.

1299
01:21:21,991 --> 01:21:26,991
When people like Metallica started
wearing Gbh shirts and coming to see the

1300
01:21:27,001 --> 01:21:28,060
chrome eggs.
Yeah.

1301
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:33,030
When people like anthrax started
daring to come to CBGBS. Yeah.

1302
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:37,290
You know, and that's really,
but the hardcore bands
started getting more metallic.

1303
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:37,870
Yeah.

1304
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:41,070
Because like metal heads started shaving
their heads and getting into hardcore,

1305
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:44,140
like the kid, like yourself, like kids
who had been listening to Don Halan,

1306
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:47,750
they were little who started
getting into hardcore bands,

1307
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:52,620
started getting more metallic.
We, we definitely to be, I
mean, did agnostic front.

1308
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:57,490
Yeah. Know, they, a lot of people tried
to jump ship, you know, I guess I don't,

1309
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:00,060
I say that kind of jokingly,
but I guess, you know,

1310
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:05,090
it seemed like there was more opportunity
to actually make living bigger on a

1311
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:09,540
bigger audience, you know,
actual record deals, you know,

1312
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,750
Pantera, Pantera, fucking
great band cause Pantera,

1313
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:18,030
me and one of my favorite bands
probably, you know, dime bag, uh,

1314
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:19,920
fucking love that dude.

1315
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:25,350
One of the worst tragedies imaginable,

1316
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:26,940
uh, to, uh,

1317
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
music is motherfucker got shot on stage
for and buy a fucking psychotic fan.

1318
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:37,560
I mean, it's like, you know, like
the fuck man. Yeah. That was awful,

1319
01:22:38,110 --> 01:22:43,080
you know. Yeah. It's uh, yeah. I
mean not to, not to talk about,

1320
01:22:43,081 --> 01:22:46,920
not to get into, you know, the whole
chrome mag beef and this and that.

1321
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:48,810
But like one thing I will say is,
you know,

1322
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:55,220
it really bothers me that a dime bag
died like that and that they never,

1323
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:58,500
cause I know they would have buried the
hatchet by now and they would have done

1324
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:00,690
an amazing that the union
tour and they would,

1325
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:04,800
if they would have just kicked the shit
out of everybody and they'll never have

1326
01:23:04,801 --> 01:23:06,160
that opportunity now

1327
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,080
because he was robbed from us.

1328
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:13,530
And to know that my band or
search a bunch of stubborn,

1329
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:19,200
immature fucking old ass holes that we
can never actually embrace each other

1330
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,800
purely based on what we did achieve
together and how many fans would be so

1331
01:23:27,101 --> 01:23:31,210
happy, you know, because once,
once you're gone, you're gone.

1332
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,740
And you know,

1333
01:23:32,770 --> 01:23:37,770
it's very rare that four or five people
will have that chemistry for a moment in

1334
01:23:39,881 --> 01:23:43,180
life. So, you know, just
based on that alone,

1335
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:46,520
it's pretty fucking sad and
pathetic, you know? Yeah.

1336
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,560
And it's weird run that you guys
have, cause you guys, you guys,

1337
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:54,520
you guys were on the verge.
Yeah. I mean, yeah. And,

1338
01:23:54,521 --> 01:23:57,570
and when I w you know, when
I remember you guys, um,

1339
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:01,030
touring and I didn't see you on the age
of coral tour cause that was a really

1340
01:24:01,031 --> 01:24:04,240
fast talker and you went yeah and I just
didn't have the opportunity to see you

1341
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:07,270
but uh,
I saw you on the best wishes tour,

1342
01:24:07,271 --> 01:24:10,750
which was the next album that
came out and you guys were big.

1343
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:14,320
I mean you guys were just to kind
of put it in perspective for people.

1344
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:18,310
Like I think the,
the places where I saw you play,

1345
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:21,340
and this is kind of a national
brand is the house of Blues.

1346
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,340
If you've ever been to house of Blues
and I saw you a place that was as big as

1347
01:24:24,341 --> 01:24:26,410
the house of Blues, I
used to play there. Okay.

1348
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:29,050
I didn't know you actually played
there but like that kind of venue.

1349
01:24:29,051 --> 01:24:32,980
So that's in my mind, you know, that's
legit, that's abandoned that venue,

1350
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,990
you know what I mean?
When you're playing places that size,

1351
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,790
you can make a living and you,

1352
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:40,300
and if you keep going and stay consistent,
you know,

1353
01:24:40,301 --> 01:24:44,950
you can do fairly well for yourself.
But now, now this is the key. So,

1354
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:48,460
you know, age of coral comes out. You guys
are popular, you toured Europe, you know,

1355
01:24:48,461 --> 01:24:53,020
you're getting after it, you're
filling up places. Uh, best wishes.

1356
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,970
You're filling stuff you're headlining.
Best wishes.

1357
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,120
Put your playing with Motorhead to before.
Yeah.

1358
01:24:57,160 --> 01:25:00,310
You're supposed to play with black
Sabbath one time. Yeah. By the way,

1359
01:25:00,370 --> 01:25:04,050
that would actually be the
ultimate show of all time for me.

1360
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:05,440
Have to fucking agree.
Right?

1361
01:25:05,650 --> 01:25:06,920
Cause my favorite bag,

1362
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,950
yeah. Black Sabbath didn't show up
because they were having some issues.

1363
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:17,450
But uh, yeah, that, that

1364
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:26,310
was awesome, dude. I made it
on a flyer with black sand

1365
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:32,060
could die down. But here's the crazy
thing is I was reading the book,

1366
01:25:32,610 --> 01:25:33,750
I couldn't believe this.

1367
01:25:33,810 --> 01:25:38,610
You come home from those tours
and there you have no money. Yeah.

1368
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:43,260
Yeah. And you hear this, this is kind
of like a rock and roll myth, right?

1369
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:48,430
Oh, the guy signs the contract.
If the producer, and I've
watched a bunch of, of, uh,

1370
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:52,590
uh, programs about this and what the,
what the record companies do is they say,

1371
01:25:52,591 --> 01:25:52,861
hey look,

1372
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:55,080
we're gonna give you a hundred thousand
dollar advance for your next album.

1373
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:56,850
And then you go,
awesome.

1374
01:25:56,851 --> 01:25:59,380
So they give you a hundred grand
and you start spending it, you,

1375
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:02,760
and then they back charge you
for your studio time and the,

1376
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:04,160
and next thing you know,

1377
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:08,930
literally at the end, you haven't even
gone onto it. You owe them $25,000.

1378
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:12,680
You're working to pay it off,
they lend you this money with interest.

1379
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:16,940
And so that's the kind of shit that was
happening with you and you come back off

1380
01:26:16,941 --> 01:26:21,350
these tours. You're famous. Cause also
at this time, now that I think about it,

1381
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:24,260
you and the Cro mags,

1382
01:26:24,261 --> 01:26:26,780
you guys were like on the cover
of like the metal magazine,

1383
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,570
all those stupid metal magazines,
man,

1384
01:26:29,571 --> 01:26:33,250
you'd term they'd be like skid row on
one page and us on the next [inaudible]

1385
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:37,060
you're like, I thought, fuck yeah. Is
he on one page? Me On the next, yeah.

1386
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:39,280
So you were there. I mean, yeah,

1387
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,770
we were on the cusp right
about to break it, you know,

1388
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,530
and you were still broke still.

1389
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,290
You would come home from his tours and
still be living on the streets. I would,

1390
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:53,170
I would be coming off those stories and
trying to figure out where I was staying

1391
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,010
or I'd be showing up at my grandmother's
house, you know, or I'd be like,

1392
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:02,180
yeah, we got pretty
fucked man. But you know,

1393
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,970
you don't know what you don't know.
You know that.

1394
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:11,060
So it's like when you're a kid and uh,
you ain't got no guidance,

1395
01:27:11,090 --> 01:27:13,640
nobody looking out for you, you
know, you make a lot of mistakes.

1396
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:16,190
And also back then they had a
bunch of better monopoly there.

1397
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:20,120
Here they're nowadays how to screw
you. You can say, Oh, you know what,

1398
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:23,870
I'll just make my own record and I'll
be able to distribute it through the

1399
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,340
Internet and social media, all
this other stuff. You know,

1400
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:29,930
that would have been helpful in
those days as far as you know.

1401
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:32,110
Yeah.

1402
01:27:32,110 --> 01:27:34,060
But, um, you know,

1403
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:38,230
I think that the Internet and everything
is also really kind of fucked music up

1404
01:27:38,231 --> 01:27:42,370
because it's like people don't have
to have any, uh, lineage or any,

1405
01:27:42,371 --> 01:27:44,050
a connection to their roots anymore.

1406
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:46,870
It's like people who don't know anything
could just Google it and cut it and

1407
01:27:46,871 --> 01:27:49,060
paste it and call it their own.
And the next thing you know,

1408
01:27:49,061 --> 01:27:51,520
they're an artist and it's like,
no, you're not a fucking artist.

1409
01:27:51,521 --> 01:27:54,370
You're a fucking cut and paste and
motherfucker who hasn't ever actually

1410
01:27:54,371 --> 01:27:57,970
experienced the fucking thing and you
don't even know the history of what you're

1411
01:27:57,971 --> 01:28:00,400
imitating. You just know that
you're into it right now.

1412
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:03,550
So you're imitating it right now.
The other crazy thing is

1413
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:04,320
okay,

1414
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,153
you know.

1415
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:06,140
Okay.

1416
01:28:06,140 --> 01:28:09,170
It was hard to get like these
records when I was a kid. Yeah.

1417
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:11,650
You had to know you couldn't order them.
Yeah.

1418
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:15,650
You had to like get somebody that
was going to go to New York and hey,

1419
01:28:15,651 --> 01:28:17,110
if they have this album,
can you pick it up?

1420
01:28:17,111 --> 01:28:21,770
Or you go to Bleeker bobs and grab it.
And it was like that he couldn't just,

1421
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,150
but nowadays you can if you say, oh the
chromatids are cool cause I heard a song,

1422
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:28,790
you put them into Google,
you get cro mags,

1423
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,590
you get every other band
that's been related to them.

1424
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:33,400
You get bounced at Sam like them and
you can just download them all the media

1425
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:36,740
and it's no factor. It's kind
of crazy. That's why for me,

1426
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:41,770
like you know how many record total
record albums I had and I loved music,

1427
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:43,220
I probably had like

1428
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,510
okay

1429
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:47,430
80 records,
right?

1430
01:28:47,460 --> 01:28:51,000
80 records on my computer
right now on my phone.

1431
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:55,080
I probably got 10,000 records. No
cat on all kinds of songs. Right.

1432
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:58,930
Every band that's ever existed.
I got him on my phone. Then you,

1433
01:28:58,931 --> 01:29:03,840
you would shit if you saw
my fucking would shit.

1434
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:09,430
It would fucking be like, like a kid
in a candy store man. You fucking him.

1435
01:29:09,431 --> 01:29:12,170
Cause I got everything from back then.
I got it all.

1436
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:17,490
I got like Motorhead test pressings I
got like you're one of those guys gets

1437
01:29:17,540 --> 01:29:18,373
test Fresno.

1438
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,910
I was watching some video with the Rollins
Rollins and he has my first single,

1439
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:24,930
he bought it from me.

1440
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:31,100
I think he might have one of the most
epic record collections that he likes.

1441
01:29:31,351 --> 01:29:34,800
Weird stuff like stuff that like I
wouldn't want it, but he's got, you know,

1442
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,440
first pressings test pressing.
He's a freak

1443
01:29:39,450 --> 01:29:42,210
and he's got money too, you
know, he's a good dude. Yeah.

1444
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:46,650
You end up trying to
try to sue a little bit.

1445
01:29:46,651 --> 01:29:48,900
I think he tried to sue the record
company or something and you end up just

1446
01:29:48,901 --> 01:29:50,470
going into legal cost.

1447
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:54,360
What trying to happen was we were trying
desperately to get off of our record

1448
01:29:54,361 --> 01:29:58,770
label and get away from our management
because we got to a certain point where

1449
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,400
we were just on the verge of
blowing up and profile was,

1450
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:07,140
was still treating us like chumps,
you know, we weren't getting no money,

1451
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:10,110
we weren't getting anything. We were
getting treated like fucking dog shit.

1452
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:15,480
And I'm someone who was working at
Electra was interested in signing us.

1453
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:18,840
So we were like, electro
Metallica, here's our fucking shot.

1454
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:22,680
So we like got to file
profile middlish right.

1455
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,780
No profile was actually a hip hop label.

1456
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:28,860
So what they did with us was really kind
of out there out there because they had,

1457
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:29,131
you know,

1458
01:30:29,131 --> 01:30:34,131
their big band with century media that
came after no profile was big for run

1459
01:30:34,951 --> 01:30:39,810
DMC. That was who there and then
like rob bass, it takes two.

1460
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,840
It takes do that was like there,
there was big,

1461
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:44,940
that was their hits run
DMC was their main shit.

1462
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:49,260
Speaking across over run DMC.
Yeah, they brought the metal.

1463
01:30:50,780 --> 01:30:53,490
I mean, you know, those
guys were great man.

1464
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:57,030
I saw that first year played
so many times back in the day.

1465
01:30:57,031 --> 01:31:00,000
I remember seeing them with the Beastie
boys at the garden and that was a

1466
01:31:00,001 --> 01:31:02,130
fucking great show. It was fun, man.

1467
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:05,230
It's like the Beastie
boys brought all like the,

1468
01:31:05,231 --> 01:31:07,500
the little white kids and run DMC ball,

1469
01:31:07,501 --> 01:31:10,040
the black kids and the black kids with
his walking round Robin all the way

1470
01:31:12,610 --> 01:31:17,430
fucking pick off like watching people
just get yoked like an I, I, I'm like,

1471
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:21,720
this shit is hilarious.
It was 40 oh damn.

1472
01:31:21,900 --> 01:31:26,250
So you're trying to get off that label
and trying to get on to electric dam

1473
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,640
cause electrodes. Yeah. Yeah. That would
have been a good move for us. But um,

1474
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:34,670
profile didn't like us and
they would have rather taken,

1475
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:39,840
you know, they couldn't offer them
enough money to give us our freedom.

1476
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:42,620
They were like fuck
these dudes. Yeah. Yeah.

1477
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:45,240
We had some issues with
some of the people there.

1478
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:49,560
And then you end up so with uh,

1479
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:52,110
with Alpha Omega,
and by the way,

1480
01:31:52,111 --> 01:31:55,330
I didn't say this but you
sang on best wishes John.

1481
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,550
I sang on like half the
album more or less. You know.

1482
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:02,830
And then me and John both sang on iPhone
Mordoff Omega and I got to read this

1483
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:06,850
from the book cause I got
a kick out of it. Oh boy.

1484
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,370
Theory goes back to the book.

1485
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:13,720
You know how you can always tell when
a heavy band is starting to lose their

1486
01:32:13,721 --> 01:32:18,010
edge when they start using
a fucking keyboard. Yeah,

1487
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:23,110
we did that.
All right.

1488
01:32:23,111 --> 01:32:27,490
To be fair, I was eating a lot of
mushrooms that they recording session.

1489
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,690
So like things sounded a little bit
different to me and they were sounding the

1490
01:32:31,691 --> 01:32:32,980
keyboards,
how to cool man.

1491
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:40,240
I was eating all kinds of mushrooms and
drinking mushroom tea and I was like,

1492
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:44,680
yeah, that shit sounds cool
to roll with that, you know?

1493
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,420
Was he at least I can look back
and laugh at myself? You know?

1494
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:52,110
It's like if you can't fucking laugh
at yourself, man, you're an asshole.

1495
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,400
And some other,
I think I might to breeze through it.

1496
01:32:54,401 --> 01:32:57,100
But there's another point where you
were talking about how spinal tap ish,

1497
01:32:57,130 --> 01:33:01,310
like all this and even that spinal
tap is right. We just started. Yeah.

1498
01:33:08,190 --> 01:33:10,840
So Ed, did you want to hear
some really fucking funny?

1499
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:15,570
I mean the me and Doug watched spinal
tap with John one time. Just, just,

1500
01:33:15,571 --> 01:33:19,330
just to show you a little bit about his
intellect. All right, we'll watch it.

1501
01:33:19,331 --> 01:33:22,510
And about halfway through that movie,
John Turns to me and done goes,

1502
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:26,920
Yo man,
these guys suck.

1503
01:33:27,490 --> 01:33:30,820
I've never even heard of them.
Why did they make a movie about them?

1504
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:35,740
Mean dog is look at each other like
this mother thinks this is a real

1505
01:33:35,741 --> 01:33:40,390
documentary. Oh my fucking,
anyway, sorry. I had to, hey,

1506
01:33:40,391 --> 01:33:45,260
you know what I've seen,
I've seen spinal tap twice live.

1507
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:49,040
Oh, I saw them once. Yeah,
I have a spinal tap lighter.

1508
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:55,980
I brought my wife and you know when they
play big bottoms all play base basis.

1509
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:01,550
Those are fucking brilliant.
No,

1510
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,900
but I remember like being in those clubs
where you would find trying to find the

1511
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:08,020
stage. You're walking around and you're
like, all right Cleveland, Cleveland.

1512
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:13,000
You're like fucking outside the club.
Yeah.

1513
01:34:13,710 --> 01:34:15,440
Uh,
now

1514
01:34:17,950 --> 01:34:20,620
you're still and you're still struggling.

1515
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:26,980
I struggled up until pretty much not that
long ago, two weeks ago. Like I said,

1516
01:34:29,350 --> 01:34:32,110
he wrote, you wrote here before
I get into this next chapter,

1517
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,500
I'm telling you that I had to lose a lot
of stuff from this error cause I have

1518
01:34:35,501 --> 01:34:40,501
kids now and I don't want them to know
exactly how insane things got or to think

1519
01:34:40,781 --> 01:34:44,920
I'm a worst piece of shit then
they already will or do. But again,

1520
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:48,400
this is proof that you can plumb it to
the bottom of the worst depths of hell

1521
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:52,690
and still come back and try to become a
better person. There was enough filth,

1522
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:53,733
drugs,

1523
01:34:53,890 --> 01:34:58,160
or gs violence and crime during this
period to write a book about nothing

1524
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,590
else.
As insane as it was.

1525
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:04,610
And as much fun as I thought
I was having deep down,

1526
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:05,900
I was looking for a way out.

1527
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:09,350
I think that's why I took
everything to such an extreme.

1528
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:12,050
I don't think I cared if I lived.

1529
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:16,420
There were times I
don't think I wanted to.

1530
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:20,860
I'm not proud looking back on it now,
if anything,

1531
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:24,130
I'm sort of surprise.
I survived.

1532
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:28,513
Okay.

1533
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:33,420
Heavy. It's fucked up here. And you
read that Shit Bro. Like it makes me go.

1534
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:38,280
Hmm. But yeah, man, it's true. You know,

1535
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:44,000
you know,
I've seen some of my friends

1536
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:45,903
that

1537
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:49,100
they,
they start to,

1538
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:54,380
I think get the same outlook and
they start doing shit that is,

1539
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:58,910
uh, not, you know, high
survival rate activities.

1540
01:35:58,911 --> 01:36:03,380
Yeah. And it's like they're
walking that line of,

1541
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:06,230
you know, well, it's kind
of like you want to die,

1542
01:36:06,231 --> 01:36:10,130
but you're not going to take the
pussy route and kill yourself.

1543
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:15,190
So you're just going to do everything
you can to kill yourself without actually

1544
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,130
putting a rope around your
neck. So instead of putting
a rope around your neck,

1545
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:23,150
you put a rope around your arm and stick
a fucking needle in it, or you know,

1546
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:28,010
smoke dust until the world
is just a fucking illusion.

1547
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:33,440
You know, I'm going to read this right
here because this is, this is, you know,

1548
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:35,830
here you go back to the book.
At one point I was

1549
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:36,611
broke.
His Shit.

1550
01:36:36,611 --> 01:36:41,050
This is after you have three albums signed
by a major record contract toward all

1551
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:45,130
over the world, played with Motorhead
on tour. Here we go back to the book.

1552
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:49,240
At one point I was broke as shit and
I got busted shoplifting food at a

1553
01:36:49,241 --> 01:36:52,220
supermarket.
I didn't have any ID,

1554
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:56,150
so the kids I was with ran back to the
house and came back with three of my CD

1555
01:36:56,151 --> 01:36:57,290
covers his ID.

1556
01:36:57,470 --> 01:37:01,670
I was sitting in this holding area in
the back of the store and the store cops

1557
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,940
were looking at me all confused.
They were like, this is your Id.

1558
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:08,930
I was holding up pictures from the age
of coral best wishes and Alpha Omega and

1559
01:37:08,931 --> 01:37:12,170
I was like, see, look at the picture
and look at my tattoos. This is me.

1560
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:17,680
They were like, you're kidding, right?
This is all the id you got. That's,

1561
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:21,570
yeah. I didn't even have a fuck. I
had no idea. I had nothing. Dude.

1562
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:25,930
I just realized that I completely breathe.
Breezed over.

1563
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:28,940
Is that I'm saying that you had this
record and you had this record yet.

1564
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:34,150
You're also a sick bassist. I mean like
an unbelievable basis. You know, like,

1565
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,030
like she had this incredible
musical talent. You play drums too,

1566
01:37:37,031 --> 01:37:40,090
but I mean your bass playing is drama,

1567
01:37:40,930 --> 01:37:43,900
but that's well and good.

1568
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:46,390
But your base plan is sick.

1569
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:50,620
So he had all this talent and you had
records and you had fans and you had all

1570
01:37:50,621 --> 01:37:55,590
the shit and you're still down in the down
in the dirt, shoplifting, shoplifting,

1571
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:01,290
fucking smoking ice dude. Hey Man.
You know, it could've been worse,

1572
01:38:01,291 --> 01:38:03,920
man. I mean, look at fucking
people like Jocko Pistorious.

1573
01:38:03,930 --> 01:38:08,760
I mean that mother fucker was like
the most spaces. Yeah, like the,

1574
01:38:10,170 --> 01:38:11,360
and Jimmy Hendrix,
you know,

1575
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:14,760
he was the Jimi Hendrix of base and
look at Jimmy and him and it's like,

1576
01:38:14,761 --> 01:38:18,110
you know, you can have all that
talent and if you're, you know,

1577
01:38:18,111 --> 01:38:22,680
if you're suffering on the inside,
man, you know, me and fucking Jocko,

1578
01:38:22,681 --> 01:38:26,360
there's another tragedy. Motherfucker got
beat to death by a balancer. You know,

1579
01:38:26,370 --> 01:38:29,710
who didn't know who he was.
This is not this Jocko,

1580
01:38:30,990 --> 01:38:31,830
Jocko Pistorius.

1581
01:38:32,610 --> 01:38:36,360
He actually got tried to get up on stage
at a Santana show him because he was

1582
01:38:36,361 --> 01:38:39,660
friends with Santana and he tried to get
up on the stage and he was so fucking

1583
01:38:39,661 --> 01:38:42,540
messy at the time that
nobody could recognize him.

1584
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:45,420
And the bouncers threw him out and he
kept being belligerent and they beat him

1585
01:38:45,421 --> 01:38:49,650
to death. You know? So it's like you
can have all the talent in the world,

1586
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:50,740
but you know it's,
it's this,

1587
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:55,110
it's sad because really the people who
are have that gift usually are people who

1588
01:38:55,111 --> 01:38:59,160
are really emotionally well that's why
they have that gift because they're so

1589
01:38:59,161 --> 01:39:03,540
fucking emotional, you know? I
think you know that definitely.

1590
01:39:03,550 --> 01:39:08,550
Then that can really become destructive
if you don't have a positive place.

1591
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,140
Like if you're really,

1592
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:14,550
the only times in my life where I haven't
been all fucked up on drugs was when I

1593
01:39:14,551 --> 01:39:19,551
had something constructive to do
something that gave me a purpose.

1594
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:25,320
And when you have that creative,
emotional

1595
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,350
self destructive thing in you,

1596
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:34,280
because it really can become
self destructive if you
don't have a place to put

1597
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:35,450
it. I mean, shit man,

1598
01:39:35,451 --> 01:39:38,330
if you wouldn't have fucking gone into
the military and God knows what the fuck

1599
01:39:38,331 --> 01:39:42,740
you would have done with that intensity.
No, the military I've talked about that,

1600
01:39:42,741 --> 01:39:46,590
you know, I mean it's like it's
a beautiful thing for me. Yeah.

1601
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:50,400
I mean you probably would have been for
me too. I just wound up. But you know, in,

1602
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:53,990
instead I wound up being a soundtrack
to your yeah. But a lot of,

1603
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:56,130
a lot of fighters,
you know,

1604
01:39:56,210 --> 01:40:00,110
a lot of UFC fighters and stuff and a
lot of those guys have a rough time,

1605
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:01,370
you know?
Absolutely.

1606
01:40:01,700 --> 01:40:06,700
It's hard to be that type of an intense
person and to go to such extreme

1607
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:11,150
emotional dumps because,
you know,

1608
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:14,570
one second you're just a
tough guy on the street.

1609
01:40:14,571 --> 01:40:17,630
The next second you're a tough guy in
front of fucking thousands of people and

1610
01:40:17,631 --> 01:40:21,350
there's lights flashing everywhere,
you know? And then, you know,

1611
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:23,250
okay.

1612
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:24,001
And then some people,

1613
01:40:24,001 --> 01:40:27,060
it's like your career has done and you're
still that tough guy who still will

1614
01:40:27,061 --> 01:40:30,210
fuck shit up, but nobody gives a
fuck. And now if you fuck somebody up,

1615
01:40:30,211 --> 01:40:33,360
you're going to fucking jail. You
know? And it's like, you know,

1616
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:38,361
and drugs become an easy way to deal
with fame and the confusion of popularity

1617
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:44,760
and the depression.
It's a heavy thing to go from,

1618
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:46,570
ah,

1619
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,750
to the silence of your room and your mind.

1620
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:53,170
There's a buddy of mine plays
in a band called slightly

1621
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,530
and they're actually a big band.
And they play in front.

1622
01:40:56,560 --> 01:41:00,790
They're from San Diego and one of the
guys in, and he, you know, we were just,

1623
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:03,100
you know, he's got a little
kid, he's a normal guy,

1624
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:07,090
but he plays in a slightly
stupid and he was, you know,

1625
01:41:07,091 --> 01:41:09,960
they just got back from tour and you know,
I just said something to mud.

1626
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,490
How wasn't he goes, man, that
just never gets old. You know,

1627
01:41:12,491 --> 01:41:16,720
getting up in front of 10,000 people that
are singing your songs, man. He said,

1628
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:20,230
it's just like unbelievable
man. I tell you, man,

1629
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:23,860
I haven't been in taught on tour
in a really long time and, and um,

1630
01:41:24,280 --> 01:41:26,200
last time I gigged out.

1631
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:33,300
I think the last time I did
a tour was like 2011 or 12.

1632
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:39,040
And then a lot of shit went
south in my life. Go figure.

1633
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:42,580
And I needed time to

1634
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,930
pull myself back up and
get my shit back together.

1635
01:41:48,100 --> 01:41:51,790
I'm going on tour in about nine days.

1636
01:41:51,791 --> 01:41:54,520
I'll be playing in Berlin first.

1637
01:41:54,710 --> 01:41:58,300
I'm going to be playing a bunch of shows
in Germany. I'll be playing in Venice,

1638
01:41:58,750 --> 01:42:02,320
in Italy and I'll be
playing in Switzerland.

1639
01:42:02,321 --> 01:42:05,440
I believe in Belgium and the UK.
I'm going to have about 13,

1640
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:08,860
12 or 13 shows and 13 or 14 days.

1641
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:14,430
I'm really, really looking
forward to this. Um,

1642
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:19,260
I'm not looking forward to driving five,
six hour drive,

1643
01:42:19,261 --> 01:42:22,720
so I'm not looking forward
to not sleeping in my bed.

1644
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:25,600
I'm not looking forward to
not waking up next to my wife.

1645
01:42:25,601 --> 01:42:27,760
I'm not looking forward to all that shit,

1646
01:42:27,761 --> 01:42:32,761
but I'm really fucking looking
forward to doing my thing again.

1647
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,300
You know,

1648
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:39,010
I got so involved with Jujitsu
and teaching Jujitsu and stuff,

1649
01:42:39,011 --> 01:42:42,610
that music actually started
to take kind of a back seat,

1650
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:47,440
especially when I had my kids and I
really couldn't tour and stuff anymore.

1651
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:50,800
Uh, why? It was a choice I made. I mean,

1652
01:42:50,801 --> 01:42:52,390
I could have done whatever
the fuck I wanted,

1653
01:42:52,391 --> 01:42:55,390
but I chose to be there for my kids.

1654
01:42:56,380 --> 01:42:59,180
Now they're older and
so on. And Life is, uh,

1655
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:06,370
has made this possible to do again.
I can't wait man.

1656
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:10,000
And um, you know, this

1657
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:12,530
okay.

1658
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:16,400
Affecting people the way I, you
know, you do with music, it's a,

1659
01:43:16,700 --> 01:43:20,000
you make a connection, you know,
you know, you, you know, look man,

1660
01:43:20,001 --> 01:43:22,880
I'm sitting across from you now because
of a fucking album I did 30 fucking

1661
01:43:22,881 --> 01:43:27,590
years ago. Was that fucking
tell you, you know, it's good.

1662
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,013
MMM.

1663
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:35,780
You're going back to book here.
You're, you're at that point, you know,

1664
01:43:35,781 --> 01:43:36,000
you,

1665
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,300
this is know the same time period where
you're getting arrested for shoplifting.

1666
01:43:41,410 --> 01:43:41,790
Okay,

1667
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:46,470
here we go. I was in a state of depression
and the drugs helped me stay in it.

1668
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,030
I was trying to get better as far as
wanting to get off drugs at least half the

1669
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:54,890
time, and I would for a few days
or a week or so here or there,

1670
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,460
but I was just too depressed and
one thing would lead to another.

1671
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:03,260
Then back in to the abyss,
the death spiral into emptiness,

1672
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:06,020
nothing and nowhere ness.

1673
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,240
Of course I was all into Alice and chains
and nine inch nails and all of that

1674
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:16,070
fucking depressed drug music.
But even as fucked up as I was,

1675
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:17,660
okay

1676
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:22,660
there was this wheat grass juice stand
on mission and I'd still make sure to go

1677
01:44:23,061 --> 01:44:26,780
get a shot of wheat grass juice
every day because I figured, hey,

1678
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:31,400
at least wheat grass juice is
equal to eating tons of vegetables.

1679
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:34,640
But I was trying to sort of stay
healthy. Like I was like, okay,

1680
01:44:34,641 --> 01:44:37,580
I know I'm not eating regularly
and I'm not eating very well,

1681
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:41,360
so let me at least try
to, you know, and this is,

1682
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:44,660
this is another thing that's
again I think this Georgia state.

1683
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:48,770
So I go to monkeys, Dorothy heroin
and fucking wheat grass juice.

1684
01:44:57,980 --> 01:44:58,813
Horrible.

1685
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:06,660
I'd go to music stores and pretend I
was going to buy shit and just play

1686
01:45:06,661 --> 01:45:08,970
instruments. I'd hang out as
long as I could and then leave.

1687
01:45:08,971 --> 01:45:11,760
I actually got offered gigs
while I was playing in stores.

1688
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:14,970
I got offered gigs for doing
sessions for different producers,

1689
01:45:14,971 --> 01:45:18,000
but I'd be all fucked up and miss the
session cause I wouldn't know what day it

1690
01:45:18,001 --> 01:45:21,300
was. And then realize a day or two later
I'd boot lose their business card or

1691
01:45:21,301 --> 01:45:23,670
whatever.
So you just can't get your shit.

1692
01:45:26,270 --> 01:45:28,670
I was pretty fucking,
it was embarrassing.

1693
01:45:28,671 --> 01:45:31,020
And that was by the way that was
taking place out on the west coast.

1694
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:36,810
It sounds like. I went to San Francisco
to clean, get clean off drugs.

1695
01:45:36,811 --> 01:45:39,570
I was like the worst city.
Fuck I clean.

1696
01:45:40,120 --> 01:45:45,120
I haven't you ever heard of Idaho or
where you're new to checkout Idaho or

1697
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:50,670
Montana? Uh, thank you. Move back,

1698
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:55,080
move back to New York and now you start
kind of bringing it back together.

1699
01:45:55,440 --> 01:45:59,030
I'd go for these long runs at
night cause I couldn't sleep. Uh,

1700
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,800
your girl lived down by the twin towers
and I'd run from there to central park

1701
01:46:01,801 --> 01:46:03,900
and back on the way it stopped
by Coney island high on,

1702
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:06,540
on Saint Mark's place to see who
was hanging out for a few minutes.

1703
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:09,480
Say Hi then keep running
uptown to the top of the park.

1704
01:46:09,481 --> 01:46:12,660
I'd run a few laps around the reservoir
and then turn around and head back down

1705
01:46:12,661 --> 01:46:13,411
on the way back down.

1706
01:46:13,411 --> 01:46:16,950
It stopped at Coney island high again
and there would be the same people.

1707
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,290
Everyone was pretty
much in the same place,

1708
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:23,100
just slightly more shit faced and had
hang for a few more minutes and then keep

1709
01:46:23,101 --> 01:46:23,934
running.

1710
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:27,690
It was kind of good to see that as I
was getting my shit together to see all

1711
01:46:27,691 --> 01:46:31,470
these people not really doing anything
but standing around getting fucked up as

1712
01:46:31,471 --> 01:46:33,420
they got older and did
nothing with themselves.

1713
01:46:33,510 --> 01:46:35,970
It gave me motivation to
keep my shit together.

1714
01:46:38,250 --> 01:46:39,083
So

1715
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:44,400
yeah, that's when I started
pulling myself back up.

1716
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:47,700
You know in one of the things that

1717
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:51,540
helped with that, first of
all, you guys got def jam,

1718
01:46:51,570 --> 01:46:54,900
you guys got signed to Def
Jam, is that right? We had a,

1719
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,980
they gave you an advance or something,

1720
01:46:55,981 --> 01:46:59,490
but we got an advance to record something
for them and then the deal wound up

1721
01:46:59,491 --> 01:47:01,320
falling apart.
So we wound up

1722
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:06,480
being left with the recordings in our
possession that we were able to then put

1723
01:47:06,481 --> 01:47:09,660
out ourselves what, what
album was on revenge. Okay.

1724
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:12,900
Which I thought was actually a
really good album, but, um, you know,

1725
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:17,040
it is what it is. But didn't think
shit, never managed to stay together.

1726
01:47:17,041 --> 01:47:19,140
That band just had fucked up Karma

1727
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:26,010
and all around this time you
started your Jiu Jitsu career. Yes.

1728
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,580
Yeah. Well that's, you know, I,
I've said it many times, man,

1729
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:33,170
Hanzo really fucking saved my
life and a lot of ways cause uh,

1730
01:47:35,190 --> 01:47:37,110
you know, even though I
was doing those, you know,

1731
01:47:38,610 --> 01:47:40,770
12 mile runs and shit like that,
I mean,

1732
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:44,600
I've worked my way up to really do one
long ones. I started off doing like three,

1733
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:47,040
four miles.
I got into it,

1734
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:53,600
but I would still have my moments
of just like a depression and um,

1735
01:47:53,630 --> 01:47:57,600
just,
and I'd want to get fucked up and stuff.

1736
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:01,050
But I had Jujitsu and,
uh,

1737
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:04,740
I was living in my rehearsal studio.
I didn't even have a fucking shower.

1738
01:48:04,741 --> 01:48:09,120
I was like bathing on the roof with
filling up a two gallon buckets.

1739
01:48:09,121 --> 01:48:11,700
I'd go up there were like four or
five buckets and just like babe,

1740
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:16,500
I was living in the rehearsal
studio. I wasn't, you know,

1741
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:20,780
life was not great,
but every day I'd go and I'd train and uh,

1742
01:48:21,570 --> 01:48:26,490
that gave me a place to,
uh, to find myself again.

1743
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:31,980
You know. When was this, what
year? Uh, it was like January,

1744
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:36,270
February of [inaudible] 96.
Okay. Like when I've came back,

1745
01:48:36,300 --> 01:48:41,300
I discovered a MMA from UFC one and
two when I was out on the west coast.

1746
01:48:42,271 --> 01:48:46,250
And I'm like, what the fuck
did he just do to him? Like,

1747
01:48:46,590 --> 01:48:51,060
I would probably, you know, hit
a thousand people in the face.

1748
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:54,950
I kicked the thousand people in the
head and the head butted and bitten,

1749
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:55,550
whatever.

1750
01:48:55,550 --> 01:49:00,550
But I ain't never seen a triangle
choke thought fuck is an arm bar,

1751
01:49:01,240 --> 01:49:05,790
you know? And I made up my mind, this is
when I was still on smack. I was like,

1752
01:49:05,791 --> 01:49:09,390
I made up my mind. I was like, Yo, if I
ever get the chance to learn that shit,

1753
01:49:09,420 --> 01:49:13,410
I'm gonna fuck them, learn that shit.
So when I came back to New York,

1754
01:49:13,411 --> 01:49:16,440
I just kept going through like black
belt magazine, Kung Fu magazine.

1755
01:49:16,450 --> 01:49:19,080
Like one of these motherfuckers got
to move out here sooner or later.

1756
01:49:19,081 --> 01:49:21,980
This is New York.
I mean they can't all stay in California.

1757
01:49:22,020 --> 01:49:24,450
They fucking room Gracie's
they're like a very big family.

1758
01:49:24,451 --> 01:49:29,370
One of them is going to have to move out
here. So Hanzo get moved. I found an ad,

1759
01:49:29,371 --> 01:49:30,850
Enzo Ku cook,

1760
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:35,640
Gracie Kukoc had said Gracie Kuka Yeager's
still with his old partner and yeah

1761
01:49:35,641 --> 01:49:36,474
man,

1762
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:41,480
I went down and I met Hanzo and that
changed my life and I was 21 years ago,

1763
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:45,630
you know, and, and a lot of people are,

1764
01:49:45,660 --> 01:49:49,540
they think I why they think it, but they
think Jiu Jitsu is going to be, you know,

1765
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:53,620
kind of when you walk in it's going
to be intimidating. And it, you know,

1766
01:49:53,621 --> 01:49:55,870
I could tell from the way you wrote
about it hands, I was just like, Hey,

1767
01:49:55,871 --> 01:49:57,160
what's up broad,
you know,

1768
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:02,800
he just makes you feel so
welcome and so at home. Yeah.

1769
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:04,113
And um,

1770
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:06,280
okay.

1771
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:11,080
He's, you know, I can
say this and mean it.

1772
01:50:11,081 --> 01:50:13,630
You know, I, I really loved
that man. You know, he,

1773
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:18,850
he was there for me through some of the
toughest parts of my life and he didn't

1774
01:50:18,851 --> 01:50:21,130
give up on me and he believed in me.

1775
01:50:22,660 --> 01:50:26,610
And sometimes really that's all you need
is somebody to believe in you and did

1776
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:28,930
not give up on you. And, um, you know,

1777
01:50:28,931 --> 01:50:33,820
when I got arrested in 2012 and I was
all over the papers and the news and

1778
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,860
everywhere, you know, they,

1779
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:40,570
a lot of people were shying away
from me. Let's just say that. Um,

1780
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:45,610
for those of you who don't know,
I got jumped by about five or six guys.

1781
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:47,333
Uh,

1782
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:53,020
and I wound up biting a nice chunk out
of one of their faces and slice in a

1783
01:50:53,021 --> 01:50:57,670
couple of them and poke and one of them
and the process of the me getting jumped,

1784
01:50:57,671 --> 01:51:02,170
I got 40 stitches. I was stabbed. And,
um, you know, a lot of people were like,

1785
01:51:02,171 --> 01:51:05,140
you know, I can't believe he did
that, blah, blah, blah. I'm like,

1786
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:09,760
did what got jumped? You
know, I got fucking jump man,

1787
01:51:09,770 --> 01:51:13,510
the fucking telling me about slice and
cut and stab it and fucking telling me

1788
01:51:13,511 --> 01:51:18,160
shit about shit until you got five or
six motherfuckers trying to take your

1789
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:20,710
fucking life,
you know,

1790
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:24,610
then you can start talking
about how could you do this?

1791
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:28,990
How could you fuck you? You know, you
got five dudes kicking you in your face,

1792
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:30,070
stomping on you.

1793
01:51:30,520 --> 01:51:34,460
You had better be willing to stab it,

1794
01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:38,170
bite or rip someone's balls off.
You know?

1795
01:51:38,171 --> 01:51:40,300
And that's what people
don't fucking understand,

1796
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:43,240
who have never experienced
real violence or real

1797
01:51:45,190 --> 01:51:49,480
potential of death. Uh, you know,
when I first got into Jujitsu,

1798
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:52,210
it was all about the fighting.
You know? I was like, yeah,

1799
01:51:52,211 --> 01:51:56,530
learn more ways to fuck people
up. Yeah. I now I really, it's,

1800
01:51:56,590 --> 01:52:00,130
it has nothing to do with fighting for
me anymore. I mean, I just love the art.

1801
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:03,850
I love the relationships that
I've made through the art.

1802
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:08,980
I love sharing what I've learned.
If anything,

1803
01:52:08,981 --> 01:52:09,814
I'm a

1804
01:52:10,980 --> 01:52:11,680
okay.

1805
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:13,210
Again, you know, the fight or flight man,

1806
01:52:13,211 --> 01:52:17,830
I'm way more likely to run then
fight at this point because I know

1807
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:23,250
how bad things can go.
Yeah.

1808
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:27,630
You know like yeah definitely. I actually,
I might have told this story before,

1809
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:32,670
there was a bad ass marine
and his name was Da.

1810
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:36,720
That's what everyone called him and da in,
in the military DSLR for short,

1811
01:52:36,721 --> 01:52:40,480
for direct action. But that was
his initials too. But it just,

1812
01:52:40,481 --> 01:52:42,470
so it just worked and he
looked like a superhero.

1813
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:46,940
He's a total stud and he was a gang
banger from Texas and, but you know,

1814
01:52:46,941 --> 01:52:50,150
he joined them or even to be like you.
Right. But he joined but he's a black kid.

1815
01:52:50,151 --> 01:52:54,810
But he joined the Marine Corps and he was
in force recon. He was a total bad ass.

1816
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:57,650
And I, and I said, hey man, you
got to come and try Jujitsu out.

1817
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:03,110
And so he started training. They
like, after like six months,

1818
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:05,930
he came up to me and I was
like, hey man, you know,

1819
01:53:05,931 --> 01:53:08,450
cause I was like still deploying and
he's, I wouldn't see him a lot. Nice.

1820
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:11,450
Almost like a mad how you, how do
you like Jujitsu? He was like, man,

1821
01:53:11,451 --> 01:53:12,350
it's kind of fucked up.

1822
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:18,940
What do you mean bro? It's,
it's awesome. He goes, he goes,

1823
01:53:18,941 --> 01:53:21,220
no man cause I used to
feel like a real bad ass.

1824
01:53:22,240 --> 01:53:24,430
Now everybody has to you I'm
thinking about, I might be a pussy.

1825
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:28,270
So yeah man

1826
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:32,280
it is funny. It's very humbling, very,

1827
01:53:32,940 --> 01:53:37,020
very humbling game to play. It really
is. But you know at the same time though,

1828
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:43,120
to me it is, it is that though it
is a game for me. It's like when,

1829
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:45,480
when I think of fighting
or when I think of,

1830
01:53:46,410 --> 01:53:46,950
okay

1831
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:50,370
self defense, I, I I I believe in Jujitsu.

1832
01:53:50,371 --> 01:53:52,800
I mean I am 100% of believer but

1833
01:53:54,630 --> 01:53:58,560
Jujitsu is fun for me. It's not about
violence or self defense or fighting,

1834
01:53:58,700 --> 01:53:58,890
you know,

1835
01:53:58,890 --> 01:54:03,890
cause he's fighting and violence to me
is about ending something is ending.

1836
01:54:04,261 --> 01:54:08,550
Somebody, you know, I mean
cause I know I could die.

1837
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:11,700
It doesn't, I tell people all the
fucking time, I'm like, you know,

1838
01:54:11,701 --> 01:54:15,870
you don't got to worry about like uh,
you know a blackbelt kicking your ass.

1839
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:21,120
Cause he's a black belt. He's already
matured past the need to kick your ass.

1840
01:54:21,690 --> 01:54:25,980
You got to worry about that
90 pound mother fucker who
will stab you without you

1841
01:54:25,981 --> 01:54:30,210
even having a chance to say,
dude, we don't need to have
a problem. Right. You know,

1842
01:54:30,211 --> 01:54:35,211
you got to worry about that dude who's
just so don't give a fuck that before you

1843
01:54:37,051 --> 01:54:41,040
even have a chance to say buddy,
your shirts wet and you're like,

1844
01:54:42,240 --> 01:54:46,450
oh shit. You know? Yeah. And um, right.

1845
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:48,280
We've talked about that on
here. You know, people say like,

1846
01:54:48,281 --> 01:54:51,220
oh I was going to get no,
this guy said something to my wife,

1847
01:54:51,221 --> 01:54:55,630
what should I have done? I'm like, just
to grab your wife, go home and buy her,

1848
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:59,670
you know, a nice dinner and yeah, I say,
honey, I love you. You don't, I don't,

1849
01:54:59,680 --> 01:55:03,670
it's not worth getting stabbed in the
neck and it's not worth having to stab

1850
01:55:03,671 --> 01:55:04,870
that junky in the neck either.

1851
01:55:04,871 --> 01:55:08,080
And I just know from my own experience
that there's always the potential that I

1852
01:55:08,081 --> 01:55:09,220
could go to that extreme.

1853
01:55:09,490 --> 01:55:12,910
I don't think for one second because
I'm a Jujitsu black belt that like,

1854
01:55:12,911 --> 01:55:16,150
I'm just going to submit this guy and
hold them down until the police get here.

1855
01:55:16,151 --> 01:55:19,810
Because you know what that guy may have
through other friends standing in the

1856
01:55:19,811 --> 01:55:23,350
shadows behind you or that guy may
fucking start stabbing you when you're

1857
01:55:23,351 --> 01:55:27,340
looking to fuck and you're
trying to, you know, submit him

1858
01:55:27,980 --> 01:55:30,960
and all of a sudden you're
like, why? Why is that

1859
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:34,920
shirt wet? Well, you know, why
is my pants wet? Oh my God,

1860
01:55:34,921 --> 01:55:39,900
that's fucking red. You know? I mean,

1861
01:55:40,620 --> 01:55:43,590
that's just life, you know?
That's, that's why, um, you know,

1862
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:48,690
now as good as Jujitsu isn't
as good as you felt doing it,

1863
01:55:49,050 --> 01:55:54,050
you go on tour and just before we go on
to where you break up with a girl at the

1864
01:55:54,631 --> 01:55:56,670
time, blah, blah, blah,

1865
01:55:58,950 --> 01:56:01,620
back to the book without
the feeling of being needed,

1866
01:56:01,680 --> 01:56:03,900
I didn't feel I had
much purpose in my life.

1867
01:56:03,901 --> 01:56:06,270
I started falling back into fuckup mode.

1868
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:09,630
I was seeing several different
chicks around at that time.

1869
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:15,780
Hey, you wrote the book and it's wrong.
Correct. Done on her. I'm Craig can,

1870
01:56:15,781 --> 01:56:17,490
you know,

1871
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:21,810
it wasn't even so much over just a
breakup of a chick. I was actually,

1872
01:56:21,811 --> 01:56:24,900
I've been with this chick for a while
and she had a daughter and I had raised

1873
01:56:24,901 --> 01:56:27,480
her daughter. Oh. So
it was like, you know,

1874
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:31,590
also not just feeling like betrayed and
everything else that goes along with a

1875
01:56:31,600 --> 01:56:36,170
breakup. But as any father
or step father stepmother,

1876
01:56:36,570 --> 01:56:39,510
you know, you have a
certain, uh, you know,

1877
01:56:39,540 --> 01:56:43,170
you develop love for a kid even
if it's not yours, you know?

1878
01:56:43,170 --> 01:56:48,170
And that was really what was a hard on
me more than anything because the mother

1879
01:56:49,171 --> 01:56:52,680
was all fucked up on drugs and I had
actually taken the kid from her and I was

1880
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:56,640
raising the kid for her while
she was off just being a fuck up.

1881
01:56:57,990 --> 01:57:02,070
And then the grandparents
and me gotten contact.

1882
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:05,670
So I wound up doing, you know what?
You do it again. This is your family,

1883
01:57:05,671 --> 01:57:08,970
this is your blood. Thank you. Got To
grow up with your family. So that was,

1884
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:14,070
that's why I was struggling, you know, it
was because it was like, you know, I was,

1885
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:18,870
I never had a father that
gave a fuck about me.

1886
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:23,760
So every time I've been in a child's life,

1887
01:57:23,761 --> 01:57:27,830
it has really mattered to
me. He liked to be, uh,

1888
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:33,450
to protect them because no
one protected me, you know?

1889
01:57:34,740 --> 01:57:39,660
So, um, so that was why I really
started to lose my way again,

1890
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:43,320
you know, cause I was like, you
know, uh, I don't have a purpose.

1891
01:57:43,321 --> 01:57:47,760
There's no one for me to love no one for
me to care about and knowing the field,

1892
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,580
uh, my, my love, you know?

1893
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:59,430
So yeah, the drugs started to
fill in the gap again, you know,

1894
01:58:00,540 --> 01:58:02,250
but fortunately that didn't last forever.

1895
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,490
It's funny, man, some of the fucking,

1896
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:11,220
some of the toughest motherfuckers
actually got the biggest hearts.

1897
01:58:11,221 --> 01:58:13,470
And that's what a lot of people
don't realize is, you know,

1898
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:16,560
I'm sure that underneath
this rugged exterior,

1899
01:58:16,561 --> 01:58:21,060
you're quite a sensitive motherfucker, you
know? And, um, are you talking about me?

1900
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:26,510
No, I'm talking about the
guy behind you. But, uh,

1901
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:27,780
you know, I mean, seriously,

1902
01:58:27,781 --> 01:58:32,781
some of the most eldest motherfuckers
I've known in my life have been some of

1903
01:58:33,181 --> 01:58:36,840
the most sensitive people on the inside.
And I think that part of that

1904
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:42,130
illness
has been a shield,

1905
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:45,850
you know,
to protect themselves.

1906
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:50,590
I know it probably was with me
and a lot of ways, you know,

1907
01:58:50,591 --> 01:58:54,580
if I wasn't as violent as I was,

1908
01:58:54,610 --> 01:58:56,500
my neighborhood would have devoured me,

1909
01:58:57,370 --> 01:58:59,800
my environment would have
devoured me if I wasn't as,

1910
01:59:01,680 --> 01:59:03,540
Yup.
So to your point,

1911
01:59:03,930 --> 01:59:08,930
I agree with you and that's one of the
reasons why I think going back to Jujitsu

1912
01:59:10,830 --> 01:59:13,410
or boxing or wrestling or Moy,
Tai,

1913
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:16,170
but win win

1914
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:20,300
you me when we're kids,
young men,

1915
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:22,730
going back to the whole
thing about proving yourself,

1916
01:59:22,760 --> 01:59:25,160
how are you going to prove yourself
that you're tough when you're a kid,

1917
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:28,010
you go out and you fight and
you beat people up too stupid.

1918
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:32,680
You do stupid stuff when you do Jujitsu,
you know you're tough and,

1919
01:59:32,690 --> 01:59:34,760
and you know when you look at
some guy in the street like, Hey,

1920
01:59:34,761 --> 01:59:36,500
that guy might stab me, but
if he doesn't, I'm going to,

1921
01:59:36,501 --> 01:59:39,320
I will choke them out and to take me 15
seconds so I don't have to do anything

1922
01:59:39,321 --> 01:59:41,780
to prove.
That's why I think it's for me.

1923
01:59:43,070 --> 01:59:46,020
And I think it was Tim Ferriss
asked me this question, he was like,

1924
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,150
what makes a man or something like
that. And I was like, to your point,

1925
01:59:51,410 --> 01:59:56,060
for me, learning how to
fight. So learning, Jujitsu,

1926
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:02,260
getting married and having
kids and going into combat,

1927
02:00:02,261 --> 02:00:05,290
those were the three things that I
was like, okay, those three things.

1928
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:09,790
They were evolutionary to me and they
were the three things that happened where

1929
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:10,570
I said,
okay,

1930
02:00:10,570 --> 02:00:13,570
I don't have to walk around trying to
prove myself to this guy or that guy.

1931
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:15,190
I know how to fight.

1932
02:00:16,300 --> 02:00:20,260
I don't even know need to impress
that girl over there. I got a girl,

1933
02:00:20,890 --> 02:00:25,060
you know, and I got and I got mouths
to feed so I can't act like an idiot.

1934
02:00:25,450 --> 02:00:28,780
And I know I'm not a coward
in if shit goes down,

1935
02:00:29,050 --> 02:00:32,350
I know that I will do the right thing.
I know that 100%.

1936
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:35,800
So those were the things that to
me gave me like security as a man.

1937
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:39,370
And so it's the same thing that
you're saying how, you know,

1938
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:42,870
when we're young and you're out
there just to try and prove and,

1939
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:48,120
and protect and shield your,
your emotions, your sensitivity,

1940
02:00:48,260 --> 02:00:50,080
you know? Yeah. That's what you do.

1941
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:53,370
And so a good way to get over
that in my opinion, is you,

1942
02:00:53,390 --> 02:00:55,750
instead of having to fake it,
you learn it for real.

1943
02:00:55,751 --> 02:00:58,630
I wish I would've had Jujitsu
when I was a young kid.

1944
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:03,610
That would have helped me immensely,
you know? Yeah. Um, well I mean,

1945
02:01:03,611 --> 02:01:04,444
just to just,
just

1946
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:08,830
one person not just mentioned
briefly is, um, high end Gracie,

1947
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:14,130
uh, another brother that
I, I truly love. And uh,

1948
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:19,870
you know,
he died in 2007.

1949
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:21,590
It was a very tragic,
and um,

1950
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:27,990
here's a guy who was feared by
99.9% of the people that knew him.

1951
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:33,100
And the 1% of people that
knew him fucking loved them.

1952
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:38,530
And he was, you know, it's
like I'm saying like, you know,

1953
02:01:38,531 --> 02:01:41,510
you got these people who are
fucking dangerous motherfuckers.

1954
02:01:41,511 --> 02:01:45,940
You don't even want to look at them
wrong or for too long, you know?

1955
02:01:46,490 --> 02:01:51,330
But if they fucking love you, man, nobody
better fuck with you. Ever go there.

1956
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:53,690
You got a part in, in the book where
you're talking about he came home,

1957
02:01:53,691 --> 02:01:56,000
he fought in Japan, he comes
home, he gives you, you know,

1958
02:01:56,001 --> 02:02:00,170
you just had your first kid. It gives you
two grand. Yeah. If for not for nothing,

1959
02:02:00,171 --> 02:02:04,520
just for being you. And I didn't want to
take it and he's like, shut the fuck up.

1960
02:02:05,180 --> 02:02:10,010
It's for the baby. You know? I mean,

1961
02:02:10,011 --> 02:02:12,950
I know motherfuckers my whole life
we didn't do that for me. You know,

1962
02:02:13,740 --> 02:02:15,440
you know Dean Dean lister,
who's,

1963
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:18,080
you don't want one of my friends
and training partners and all that,

1964
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:22,010
but he's got some funny stories
about high end and he's like, hi.

1965
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:26,160
It was fucking crazy back. He was
a crazy motherfucker. But, but,

1966
02:02:26,230 --> 02:02:27,380
but to be honest though,

1967
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:32,440
I never had any crazy experiences with
them because I feel like when he looked

1968
02:02:32,841 --> 02:02:35,660
into my eyes, he knew he didn't
have to prove anything to me. Yeah.

1969
02:02:35,661 --> 02:02:38,390
You guys kind of countered it out.
What's that called?

1970
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:42,380
Is canceled. Well, it was like, you know,

1971
02:02:42,410 --> 02:02:44,240
I don't have to prove
I'm a bad ass to you.

1972
02:02:44,241 --> 02:02:47,240
You don't have to prove you're a bad
ass to me. Let's just go out and chill.

1973
02:02:47,370 --> 02:02:51,410
That's good. You know, we'd go out and
like go to stupid movies, like, you know,

1974
02:02:51,860 --> 02:02:56,510
go out and just work on
his English, you know,

1975
02:02:56,511 --> 02:03:00,710
like, I never, you know,
yeah. We had fun, you know,

1976
02:03:00,711 --> 02:03:05,400
but we never like gotten brawls
and got know. But I mean, you know,

1977
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,510
he died. Yeah. He got,
uh, he got arrested.

1978
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:13,370
It was a bad situation. You know,
again, it's like, you know, again,

1979
02:03:13,371 --> 02:03:18,371
this is somebody who was
very emotional and a sadly,

1980
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:19,873
you know,

1981
02:03:20,810 --> 02:03:24,610
like many people started using drugs as a,

1982
02:03:24,611 --> 02:03:28,400
as a way to deal with shit, I guess.
I don't want to say to deal with shit,

1983
02:03:28,420 --> 02:03:32,930
but maybe just as a little
bit of an escape, you know,

1984
02:03:32,931 --> 02:03:36,290
you've got to figure what
kind of fucking, uh, you know,

1985
02:03:36,291 --> 02:03:40,190
I mean his favorite song was a boy named
sue by Johnny Cash and he really felt

1986
02:03:40,191 --> 02:03:42,950
like he was living that life by being him,
you know,

1987
02:03:42,951 --> 02:03:47,060
with the name Gracie and having to be,
you know, always having to step up,

1988
02:03:47,090 --> 02:03:50,690
always having to prove himself
and always having to be a bad ass.

1989
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:55,400
And I think that when you're forced to
react and deal with things on that level

1990
02:03:55,401 --> 02:03:56,091
all the time,

1991
02:03:56,091 --> 02:04:00,610
and especially when you are
actually a nice person at heart or,

1992
02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:03,110
or a sensitive person at heart,

1993
02:04:03,111 --> 02:04:07,880
when you're forced to always take that
stance as shit to fucking tough one man,

1994
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:12,140
you know, that's a hard road
to travel. And um, you know,

1995
02:04:12,141 --> 02:04:14,660
I always have him with me always.

1996
02:04:14,690 --> 02:04:17,960
I always have him sitting on one shoulder
and hands, oh, sitting on the other.

1997
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:21,770
And uh, you know, when I look
back on it, yeah. When I have big,

1998
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:26,450
when I am confronted by,
you know, serious shit,

1999
02:04:26,930 --> 02:04:28,130
I think about,
you know,

2000
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:32,280
how one would react and how
the other would react. And,

2001
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:37,470
and then I tried to find my
own sense in there. Yeah.

2002
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:38,130
Yeah.

2003
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,510
I mean it's high.

2004
02:04:39,511 --> 02:04:43,380
It's kind of a classic example
of everything that we're
talking of. I mean, yeah.

2005
02:04:43,381 --> 02:04:46,350
For all, for all practical purposes.
You shouldn't be here right now.

2006
02:04:46,440 --> 02:04:49,070
You up either dead or in jail or whatever.
Yeah.

2007
02:04:49,250 --> 02:04:53,340
And he did his shit that was going
down the same path, but he didn't,

2008
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:57,630
didn't make it to make it
happen, you know? And uh,
that's, you know, that's the,

2009
02:04:57,631 --> 02:04:58,530
that's the thing,
man.

2010
02:04:58,531 --> 02:05:03,531
I feel really fortunate that I had music
because I think that it gave me a tool

2011
02:05:04,111 --> 02:05:08,340
to, to, uh, it gave me a paddle
to row my wave through the shit.

2012
02:05:09,630 --> 02:05:09,850
Okay.

2013
02:05:09,850 --> 02:05:14,140
But it also came with its
own load of shit. You know,
it's funny cause I, you know,

2014
02:05:14,141 --> 02:05:17,650
I probably should have encouraged my kids
to learn more about music and be more

2015
02:05:17,651 --> 02:05:22,330
musical, but I encouraged them to
be Jujitsu guys because I felt that,

2016
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:27,190
you know, MMA is way safer.
Better. There's less.

2017
02:05:27,370 --> 02:05:30,330
It's less off road. Yes.
Bad exits. You can know,

2018
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:32,790
you might get punched in your face it
bunch of times, but at least you want,

2019
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:37,350
you know, at least it won't be life
punching you in your face, you know,

2020
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:41,290
and there's, you know, all
kinds of drama around it.

2021
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:43,720
You described it to get a spinal tap,
you know,

2022
02:05:43,721 --> 02:05:46,720
just the rock and roll crap.

2023
02:05:47,410 --> 02:05:52,390
Cro mags comes to an end for the most
part and you end up putting out outer

2024
02:05:52,391 --> 02:05:54,460
record Harley's war.
Yeah.

2025
02:05:54,880 --> 02:05:58,120
And um,
good,

2026
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:01,960
good rock and roll music baby.
And uh,

2027
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:04,930
now and also during that time you,

2028
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:10,160
you had some kits.
Yeah. And you know, you,

2029
02:06:10,161 --> 02:06:15,161
you met the mother of your kids and she
wanted to go to school and so you took

2030
02:06:17,531 --> 02:06:21,520
off some time to just, yes. I pretty much

2031
02:06:23,740 --> 02:06:27,950
put my musical career on hold.
Okay.

2032
02:06:28,810 --> 02:06:29,643
You know,

2033
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:33,850
to take care of your kids. Yeah. And uh,

2034
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:39,500
you know, one of the, one
of the paragraphs that you
wrote in here is awesome. Um,

2035
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:42,860
talking about your kids and you say,

2036
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:45,320
and this is something I
completely related to,

2037
02:06:45,740 --> 02:06:48,770
I'll tell you the first time I looked
down at the other end of the mats and saw

2038
02:06:48,771 --> 02:06:51,740
my boys training. It was one of
the greatest moments in my life.

2039
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:55,610
My youngest son spent his birthday at
the Academy with George Saint Pierre and

2040
02:06:55,611 --> 02:06:56,750
all the rest of the fellas.

2041
02:06:57,050 --> 02:07:00,500
My eldest son had his birthday there
with all the Gracies in about 30 kids,

2042
02:07:00,501 --> 02:07:03,710
a full house and a cake with a
Henzel Gracie Academy logo on it.

2043
02:07:04,490 --> 02:07:09,380
My sons have grown up with Hanzo
like an uncle Igor halls, Gregor,

2044
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:12,860
Daniel, Neiman, all the guys
treat my boys like family.

2045
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:16,850
They've known their instructor
Magno Gama since birth.

2046
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:21,260
He came to the hospital to see them
hours after they were born at Hanzo.

2047
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:23,240
They have known since they were days old.

2048
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:27,740
My oldest and I have been on Greyhound
buses in the middle of the night

2049
02:07:27,740 --> 02:07:30,460
traveling hours away to represent
RGA and team hands. Oh Gracie.

2050
02:07:31,690 --> 02:07:35,190
I've competed with my son's net at
nationally ranked grappling submission and

2051
02:07:35,191 --> 02:07:36,250
Jujitsu events.

2052
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:40,990
One of my proudest moments was when we
both competed at the same event by son

2053
02:07:40,991 --> 02:07:45,991
took first place in his division and I
took second place in the expert Masters

2054
02:07:46,180 --> 02:07:51,160
Division in the 30 to 35 year old
age bracket. Although I was 44 hens.

2055
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:53,290
Oh joked when he first saw my son.

2056
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:57,340
This is the proof that even
though the fruit is rotten,

2057
02:07:57,850 --> 02:07:59,560
the seed can still be good.

2058
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:06,130
That's uh, yeah, we, we all know that one.

2059
02:08:06,520 --> 02:08:08,530
And you know,
I,

2060
02:08:08,820 --> 02:08:12,130
I guess it's when you see your kid doing
anything that you love doing and you

2061
02:08:12,131 --> 02:08:14,620
see, get to see your kid do it,
Echo, you got that in your future.

2062
02:08:15,190 --> 02:08:16,240
When you see your kid,
I'll wait.

2063
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:20,620
[inaudible] you see your daughter on the
mat right now and uh, that, that's cool.

2064
02:08:21,490 --> 02:08:26,490
When you see your kid like training
and I'm to the point right now,

2065
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:30,010
my son's a big kid. He's 14 but
he's, I can roll with it, man.

2066
02:08:30,011 --> 02:08:34,390
I can legit that can roll with that taller
than me. Yeah. He's my 14 year olds.

2067
02:08:34,600 --> 02:08:39,020
Six foot buck 80. Yeah. Yeah.

2068
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:43,240
And it's awesome when you,
when you get to train and you know,

2069
02:08:43,241 --> 02:08:47,230
the other thing I noticed
while I surf and when my son

2070
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:51,340
as good as it feels to surf like as good,

2071
02:08:51,341 --> 02:08:54,910
there's a really good feeling and
you serve as good as that feels.

2072
02:08:55,750 --> 02:08:58,720
If feels just as good,
if not better,

2073
02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:03,250
to be paddling back out after
catching the wave and see my son just,

2074
02:09:03,490 --> 02:09:08,320
just,
just getting after it and it's so awesome.

2075
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:10,120
It's like you sometimes you
sit there and watch, you know,

2076
02:09:10,121 --> 02:09:12,980
I'll just take the opposite
watching him and, and you try not,

2077
02:09:12,990 --> 02:09:15,850
you try to like contain yourself movie.

2078
02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:20,710
It's just so awesome. It's so cool. And,

2079
02:09:20,890 --> 02:09:21,950
and you know, you see, you know,

2080
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:24,280
I got a bunch of daughters too
and seeing them do when they,

2081
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:27,810
it basically when you see your kids
kicking acid stuff, man, it's man,

2082
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:29,350
it makes you feel fucking good.
You know?

2083
02:09:30,010 --> 02:09:33,040
I mean you see them doing positive and
shit specially man, cause God knows,

2084
02:09:33,041 --> 02:09:35,460
I mean,
I've done so much negative shit.

2085
02:09:35,530 --> 02:09:40,350
They, when I see my kids doing something
positive makes me feel really good. Yeah.

2086
02:09:44,090 --> 02:09:49,070
Going back to the book, Talking About Your
Dad, my dad, my father died from a fire.

2087
02:09:49,130 --> 02:09:51,890
So you, your father, your father and
we didn't talk about it much. He,

2088
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:53,270
he'd gone away and then he'd like,

2089
02:09:53,271 --> 02:09:57,470
had intermittent contact with you over
the years actually, once he was out. Yeah,

2090
02:09:57,470 --> 02:10:02,270
my life. I, you know, when my mom left
him when I was real young, you know,

2091
02:10:03,020 --> 02:10:07,790
uh, I never saw him again and I own, we
actually spoke to him twice on the phone.

2092
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:13,630
I got like one letter from him and it
was like one or two pages and a cassette

2093
02:10:16,821 --> 02:10:21,160
of him playing guitar in
a halfway house. And, um,

2094
02:10:22,040 --> 02:10:25,700
basically just apologizing a lot.

2095
02:10:26,540 --> 02:10:27,373
And uh,

2096
02:10:31,130 --> 02:10:34,040
yeah, you know, he knew he made a lot

2097
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,600
of bad choices, but, um,

2098
02:10:39,470 --> 02:10:43,610
that's fucked up though because you know
what I mean? Uh, he was all, you know,

2099
02:10:43,611 --> 02:10:46,710
he's fucked up on heroin and
he was an alcoholic. And, uh,

2100
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:50,570
he, he actually, uh,

2101
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:55,190
like kicked my mother in the stomach
when she was just like very pregnant with

2102
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:59,710
me, you know? And, um, yeah,

2103
02:10:59,711 --> 02:11:03,970
that's how much he didn't want me.
So,

2104
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:11,520
you know, it's a, it's a hard
pill to swallow, you know,

2105
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:15,060
when your father would rather be strung
out on heroin then be your father.

2106
02:11:17,030 --> 02:11:19,540
But, uh, but I, I've managed to, uh,

2107
02:11:21,680 --> 02:11:26,550
turn it around, you know, cause, uh, I
love being with not just my kids, but I,

2108
02:11:26,551 --> 02:11:30,650
I teach the kids at the ends
up Gracie Academy. And, um,

2109
02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:34,190
so the childhood that
I didn't really have,

2110
02:11:34,191 --> 02:11:38,240
I get to experience and live vicariously
through all these other kids and I get

2111
02:11:38,241 --> 02:11:42,860
to be a role model to them.
Where as I didn't have any.

2112
02:11:43,220 --> 02:11:44,060
And you know,

2113
02:11:44,061 --> 02:11:48,740
I'm teaching these little boys and little
girls how to defend themselves and how

2114
02:11:48,741 --> 02:11:49,390
to fight,

2115
02:11:49,390 --> 02:11:54,390
not to fight and have honor and how to
lose with honor and always to shake their

2116
02:11:57,831 --> 02:11:59,690
opponent's hand and say,
good job.

2117
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:03,500
Whether they win or whether they lose
and how to have that respect for their

2118
02:12:03,501 --> 02:12:07,430
opponent as well as themselves.
You know,

2119
02:12:07,431 --> 02:12:11,930
when I teach these kids that, you
know, there's like they say a Jujitsu,

2120
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:15,290
there's no losing in Jujitsu.
You win or you learn.

2121
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:18,710
And when I can take a kid who,
you know,

2122
02:12:18,711 --> 02:12:21,740
I've worked with a lot of
kids who have um, you know,

2123
02:12:23,180 --> 02:12:28,180
varying degrees of spectrum disorders
where there they've had autism or physical

2124
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:34,790
issues and to see the
improvement that they make,

2125
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:37,540
not just at Jujitsu but in,
uh,

2126
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:42,200
in their social skills. Uh, you know,

2127
02:12:42,201 --> 02:12:46,310
kids who are so insecure that they won't
look at you and now they're making eye

2128
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:48,530
contact with you,
talking to you to life,

2129
02:12:48,540 --> 02:12:50,820
change your face and
shaking your hand and,

2130
02:12:51,050 --> 02:12:55,670
and their chest is out and your shoulders
are back and they're not all, you know,

2131
02:12:55,700 --> 02:12:58,040
that,
you know.

2132
02:12:58,041 --> 02:13:01,730
So where I didn't have certain things,
you know,

2133
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:06,390
at the end of the day it
gave me something else.

2134
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:11,100
It gave me the ability to value that,

2135
02:13:11,610 --> 02:13:15,300
that relationship that you can have with
children that a lot of people take for

2136
02:13:15,301 --> 02:13:16,170
granted.
A lot of,

2137
02:13:16,500 --> 02:13:21,210
I even get disappointed with a lot of
the parents that bring their kids to

2138
02:13:21,211 --> 02:13:22,680
Jujitsu cause I feel like,
you know,

2139
02:13:22,700 --> 02:13:26,340
you're a lot of people hand their kids
off to everybody else to teach him how to

2140
02:13:26,341 --> 02:13:29,760
do everything. You know, they don't
work on stuff at home with them.

2141
02:13:29,761 --> 02:13:33,120
They don't sit there and teach
them. They don't. I get, you know,

2142
02:13:33,121 --> 02:13:35,910
when you have a kid that doesn't know
how to do a fucking jumping jack,

2143
02:13:35,911 --> 02:13:39,920
you're like, what the fuck
did your parents do with you?

2144
02:13:39,930 --> 02:13:42,680
They don't roll around with you. They
don't teach you how to do a somersault.

2145
02:13:42,720 --> 02:13:47,490
I have to teach you, which
is your left and your right
hand. Like really, you know,

2146
02:13:48,720 --> 02:13:53,580
I don't think people value
that time enough. And I have
said it before, it's like,

2147
02:13:53,581 --> 02:13:55,710
you know your, your, your job made,

2148
02:13:55,770 --> 02:13:58,440
your career may change
several times in your life.

2149
02:13:58,441 --> 02:14:00,530
Your spouse may not be your spouse for,

2150
02:14:00,550 --> 02:14:04,980
but your kids are always going to
be your kids. So you really have to

2151
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:10,470
cherish and value that and the time
that you spend with them because they'll

2152
02:14:10,620 --> 02:14:12,800
always be your kids.
You know,

2153
02:14:12,830 --> 02:14:16,140
that woman that you think you're
in love with may leave you,

2154
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:22,000
you may fall out of
love, your job May, uh,

2155
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:23,760
you know the fold,

2156
02:14:24,450 --> 02:14:28,440
but your kids you to be your kids
forever and they'll always need you,

2157
02:14:28,740 --> 02:14:33,420
even if it's just emotionally
to know that you're there.

2158
02:14:33,450 --> 02:14:38,370
Even if they're not seeing you every
year or every six months or even if you

2159
02:14:38,371 --> 02:14:40,920
don't speak to them, they, you
know, you still have to be here

2160
02:14:42,980 --> 02:14:47,300
and emotional and spiritual
backbone even from afar.

2161
02:14:47,880 --> 02:14:52,060
You know, I had no, I mean, you know,

2162
02:14:52,070 --> 02:14:55,550
I forgive you dad.
Yup.

2163
02:14:57,830 --> 02:14:58,663
You,
uh,

2164
02:14:59,460 --> 02:14:59,960
yeah.

2165
02:14:59,960 --> 02:15:02,720
When he died,
you actually flew down to Texas to a

2166
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:09,570
yeah. Basically the barrier,
the barrier and that,

2167
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:12,460
that was cool too.
I got to finally meet his mother and,

2168
02:15:12,461 --> 02:15:15,390
and learn about my father's
side of the family.

2169
02:15:15,391 --> 02:15:19,530
So there was some
closure in that, but, uh,

2170
02:15:19,550 --> 02:15:24,330
I buried him myself. I, I wouldn't
let anybody throw dirt on top of him.

2171
02:15:24,690 --> 02:15:28,350
And, uh, and as it turned out,

2172
02:15:28,351 --> 02:15:30,980
I wound up marrying my mom too with my,

2173
02:15:32,550 --> 02:15:34,560
with my youngest son.

2174
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:38,933
You're,

2175
02:15:44,840 --> 02:15:46,910
you're now,

2176
02:15:47,420 --> 02:15:52,420
you were kind of wrapping up this
book when you were writing it and,

2177
02:15:52,850 --> 02:15:56,750
and you know, you kind
of closed it out. Um, and

2178
02:15:59,150 --> 02:16:01,880
w when you closed it out, you, you
said this at the end of the book,

2179
02:16:03,050 --> 02:16:06,350
I guess part of being a father is learning
how to eat a certain amount of shit.

2180
02:16:07,520 --> 02:16:09,350
You do it for your kids
because they need you.

2181
02:16:09,500 --> 02:16:12,860
You just throw a little on a little salt
and pepper and maybe some Tabasco and

2182
02:16:12,861 --> 02:16:16,670
smile cause you gotta be there for them.
One thing my father said was,

2183
02:16:16,700 --> 02:16:19,130
I've got all these years of experience,

2184
02:16:19,370 --> 02:16:21,350
experiences that I don't
know what to do with.

2185
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:23,660
And that's Kinda how I feel with my boys.

2186
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:27,800
How do I come in for a graceful landing
after so much fucking turbulence in my

2187
02:16:27,801 --> 02:16:28,634
life?

2188
02:16:29,290 --> 02:16:33,400
Hopefully I can guide them better than
I was guided or at least maybe they will

2189
02:16:33,401 --> 02:16:34,780
learn from my mistakes.

2190
02:16:35,140 --> 02:16:38,800
God knows I've made enough for everybody.

2191
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:43,960
And if I remember correctly,
you were,

2192
02:16:44,440 --> 02:16:49,440
that was the kind of the end of the book
and then you were moving on and then,

2193
02:16:50,020 --> 02:16:54,370
and then 2012 comes along and

2194
02:16:56,710 --> 02:17:00,190
there's like a hardcore fest, you know,
they're proud of bring it back. Like, oh,

2195
02:17:00,191 --> 02:17:04,450
I don't know if it's like a reunion fest,
bringing back a bunch of old bands and

2196
02:17:06,040 --> 02:17:10,570
the chromatics w I should say a formation
of the Cro mags or members of the

2197
02:17:10,610 --> 02:17:13,870
chromatics, you can just call it the
foam egg. So let's just keep it real.

2198
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:18,850
They were going to play a fake ass band
that does my songs with one of the old

2199
02:17:18,851 --> 02:17:22,570
members, you know, and they
were going to play. Yes.

2200
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:26,590
And you were like, okay, um, you know,

2201
02:17:26,620 --> 02:17:29,200
I'm gonna go check it out and you
know what? I'll bring my base.

2202
02:17:29,201 --> 02:17:30,800
Maybe we'll get onstage.
I mean, you know what?

2203
02:17:30,840 --> 02:17:34,090
There was actually two members of the
original group playing that night and my

2204
02:17:34,091 --> 02:17:38,560
intention was to go and
to extend my hand and say,

2205
02:17:38,561 --> 02:17:42,580
you know what guys? I
buried, I love you guys.

2206
02:17:42,581 --> 02:17:46,240
As much as I hate you.
I love you. You know,

2207
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:51,610
and just because I like to think that at
the end of the day to people that were

2208
02:17:51,611 --> 02:17:55,660
friends can laugh at their
own foolishness. You know,

2209
02:17:55,750 --> 02:17:56,860
I would like to think that,

2210
02:17:57,490 --> 02:18:02,490
that people are able to look beyond their
egos and forgive each other for being

2211
02:18:04,361 --> 02:18:08,800
idiots because God knows we
all are at times. So yeah,

2212
02:18:08,801 --> 02:18:13,801
I went to that show with the hope of
maybe even being invited up on stage to

2213
02:18:14,681 --> 02:18:19,300
play a few songs with them. And
um, well the rest is history. Yeah.

2214
02:18:19,301 --> 02:18:23,230
You show up and, and here you go.
You're, you're walking through the place.

2215
02:18:23,231 --> 02:18:26,620
You go to the, you get invited up
the dressing room. Hey, come say hi.

2216
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:29,170
And then here we go back to the book.
As soon as I walked in,

2217
02:18:29,171 --> 02:18:31,930
I literally walked into the room,
took two steps, the door shot,

2218
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:35,170
and I got punched from behind
out of the corner of my eye.

2219
02:18:35,171 --> 02:18:39,190
Could see it with some big dude with
tattoos. It was like, Bam. He hit me hard.

2220
02:18:39,730 --> 02:18:42,940
I saw a bit of a flashbulb like you see
when you get hit out of nowhere and you

2221
02:18:42,941 --> 02:18:43,780
don't expect it.

2222
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:47,560
And then it was a reign of fists and kicks
that were coming from every direction

2223
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:49,570
of the room.
And this was a small room.

2224
02:18:49,571 --> 02:18:51,640
It's a dressing room and
I started falling forward.

2225
02:18:51,641 --> 02:18:55,330
I fell onto the couch and rolled onto my
back and started throwing up kicks just

2226
02:18:55,331 --> 02:18:57,100
instinctively to get people off me.

2227
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:00,640
I was getting jumped by at least
four or five guys, probably more.

2228
02:19:00,850 --> 02:19:04,270
There was a bunch of people in the room.
I think I counted seven or eight,

2229
02:19:04,271 --> 02:19:07,870
although I couldn't even really
count in all the chaos at that point.

2230
02:19:07,871 --> 02:19:10,030
I reached into my pocket,
I had a little knife,

2231
02:19:10,630 --> 02:19:13,420
I pulled it out and it
still had its sheath on.

2232
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:16,960
So I just tried to punch the first person
that was in front of me and get them

2233
02:19:16,961 --> 02:19:19,360
the fuck off me.
Everybody started screaming.

2234
02:19:19,630 --> 02:19:23,440
I saw the door of the dressing room open
and, and I started yelling, security,

2235
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:24,274
security,

2236
02:19:24,430 --> 02:19:29,300
and then I left and then I saw somebody
pull the door shut and I thought to

2237
02:19:29,301 --> 02:19:31,520
myself,
fuck these dudes.

2238
02:19:31,521 --> 02:19:34,340
Their intention is to fuck me up and
they don't want no one to see it.

2239
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:36,530
They're trying to beat the shit out of me.

2240
02:19:36,740 --> 02:19:40,430
And I've seen all these dudes in a pack
kicking people to the point where their

2241
02:19:40,431 --> 02:19:41,870
brains don't fucking work.

2242
02:19:42,110 --> 02:19:45,230
And I knew right then that if I didn't
get the fuck out of that situation,

2243
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:47,540
I was not going to make
it home in one piece.

2244
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:52,040
So I started flailing the
knife as furiously as I
could just to get myself the

2245
02:19:52,041 --> 02:19:54,350
fuck out of that situation
at toward the door,

2246
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:58,100
everybody's screaming,
he's got a knife,

2247
02:19:58,101 --> 02:20:01,940
he's got a knife and I don't even know
who it was or how they ended up in my

2248
02:20:01,941 --> 02:20:04,010
face. I guess it was when
they were lunging at my arm.

2249
02:20:04,011 --> 02:20:07,700
I bet whoever was in front of my face,
I tore a big piece out of his cheek.

2250
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:11,810
It was obvious. It was a setup.
When I saw the door pulled shut,

2251
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:14,800
I was fighting for my life. These guys
wanted to kick the shit out of me,

2252
02:20:14,810 --> 02:20:17,390
stomped me out,
and no one would see it.

2253
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:20,300
There would be no whist
witnesses and that would be that,

2254
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:24,170
but that shit was not going down.
I bet the one guy's face,

2255
02:20:24,171 --> 02:20:27,410
I just tore his fucking cheat opened
right below his eye. He was screaming,

2256
02:20:27,411 --> 02:20:28,860
blood was running down his face.

2257
02:20:28,861 --> 02:20:32,270
I bet someone's wrist as they were
trying to get the knife out of my hand.

2258
02:20:32,570 --> 02:20:34,760
I just didn't bite it.
I tried to tear a piece out.

2259
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:37,670
That's when the bouncers broken
to the room. At this point,

2260
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:41,180
I was on the bottom of a pile trying
to stab and kick and everybody started

2261
02:20:41,181 --> 02:20:44,150
trying to grab my hand. They're like,
give me the knife, give me the knife.

2262
02:20:44,151 --> 02:20:48,140
I'm security. I ended up getting dragged
out onto the balcony getting kicked.

2263
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:53,120
I got one good kick in the right face
and I'm surprised it did knock my teeth

2264
02:20:53,121 --> 02:20:55,670
out. One Dude's scream, get on
your stomach, get on your stomach,

2265
02:20:55,671 --> 02:20:57,050
put your hands out in front of you.

2266
02:20:57,940 --> 02:21:01,130
And this one big guy stepped on my back
with both of his feet and another guy

2267
02:21:01,131 --> 02:21:04,670
was looking at my face and squeezing my
throat. I don't know who the fuck was,

2268
02:21:04,671 --> 02:21:08,750
who. One guy looked at me
and said, motherfucker, I'll
kill you. I'll kill you.

2269
02:21:09,080 --> 02:21:11,840
I will kick you in your fucking face
until you are dead, motherfucker.

2270
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:13,190
If you don't stop moving.

2271
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:17,870
I saw Pete from sick of it all and the
crowd of people next to us with a freaked

2272
02:21:17,871 --> 02:21:18,681
out look on his face.

2273
02:21:18,681 --> 02:21:21,950
He was gesturing with his hands for
me to calm down and stop resisting.

2274
02:21:22,190 --> 02:21:26,870
He kept mouthing the words hardly
chill. Harley, please stop chill Harley.

2275
02:21:27,350 --> 02:21:29,890
That's when one guy said, put your
hands out in front of you. I asked her,

2276
02:21:29,891 --> 02:21:32,450
are you a cop? He was like, yeah.
So I said, show me your badge.

2277
02:21:32,690 --> 02:21:36,830
And at that point the boys in blue came
running up the stairs. I was like, fine,

2278
02:21:36,831 --> 02:21:38,120
I'm not moving any more cuff me.

2279
02:21:38,570 --> 02:21:41,450
I stuck my hands out in front
of me face down on the floor.

2280
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:45,200
I still don't know that I've been stabbed.
I've got 40 stitches in my leg.

2281
02:21:45,201 --> 02:21:49,350
Thank God it was in my leg.
Only the cops cuffed me.

2282
02:21:49,351 --> 02:21:53,210
He turned me over and that's when I saw
the wound in my leg. It was grotesque.

2283
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:54,860
The blood was bubbling out of it.

2284
02:21:55,250 --> 02:21:57,890
The fashion tendance were
literally hanging out on my leg.

2285
02:21:58,370 --> 02:22:01,070
That's why people started saying
that it was a compound fracture.

2286
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:03,680
The cops cuffed me,
they put me on a chair,

2287
02:22:03,681 --> 02:22:06,350
carried me down the stairs
and put me in the ambulance.

2288
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:09,770
It wasn't until I got cleaned up in the
ambulance that they realized it was a

2289
02:22:09,771 --> 02:22:13,840
stab wound.
Yeah,

2290
02:22:14,110 --> 02:22:15,020
it was a fun night.

2291
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:19,970
And you kind of already talked about this.

2292
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:24,020
I mean they basically arrest you
immediately was a total melee. Yeah,

2293
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:26,880
and I actually won the,
I got arrested.

2294
02:22:26,881 --> 02:22:29,730
I thought we were all going
to get arrested and there
was this going to be like

2295
02:22:29,731 --> 02:22:33,720
a bar fight. Everybody you get
pulled in. But all these fucking guys

2296
02:22:35,430 --> 02:22:38,760
started making statements
that were basically,

2297
02:22:38,761 --> 02:22:43,560
that I've launched into
the room and started just
stabbing people. So, you know,

2298
02:22:43,561 --> 02:22:46,470
you got a room full of people saying
he did it, he did it, he did it.

2299
02:22:46,480 --> 02:22:49,340
And you got one of me saying,
what the fuck happened? Fuck,

2300
02:22:49,341 --> 02:22:54,341
he thinks is good and get walked out
in cuffs and you end up on Rikers,

2301
02:22:56,460 --> 02:22:57,211
Rikers island,

2302
02:22:57,211 --> 02:23:02,211
for those of you who don't know from
around the world is a jail in New York

2303
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:07,020
jail, Rikers island.
And meanwhile the media,

2304
02:23:07,021 --> 02:23:09,580
you know, it's putting out all these, uh,

2305
02:23:10,140 --> 02:23:12,090
the version that's
getting told to the media,

2306
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:17,310
which is that you instigated it and you
were a horrible person and et Cetera,

2307
02:23:17,340 --> 02:23:21,810
et cetera. And now you're out at Rikers
island, going back to the book all night.

2308
02:23:21,811 --> 02:23:23,910
You'd hear people
screaming and talking shit.

2309
02:23:24,450 --> 02:23:27,360
The youth offenders were in the
same building as us right next door.

2310
02:23:27,750 --> 02:23:31,170
So all night you'd hear them
screaming, suck my Dick, motherfucker,

2311
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:35,670
I'll fuck you up. Suck
my dick son, but fuck,

2312
02:23:36,730 --> 02:23:37,920
oh fuck.
All night long.

2313
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:44,310
Riot cops came in all
the all fucking night.

2314
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:47,700
Then as soon as the sun would start
coming up and they'd finally shut up,

2315
02:23:47,701 --> 02:23:51,750
the seagulls would start making
noise. It was nonstop. Ironically,

2316
02:23:51,900 --> 02:23:53,910
it was the best sleep
I'd gotten in a while.

2317
02:23:53,940 --> 02:23:56,880
Ever since I started going
through the bullshit with my ex,

2318
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:00,390
my life had truly become a nightmare.

2319
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:05,490
I remember at one point I was looking
out through my window, through the gates.

2320
02:24:05,790 --> 02:24:09,000
It was a beautiful sunny day and I could
hear the birds and a butterfly flew

2321
02:24:09,001 --> 02:24:13,980
past my window and I was like,
damn, right then and there.

2322
02:24:13,981 --> 02:24:18,540
That butterfly represented freedom.
What I wouldn't do to be free right then.

2323
02:24:18,840 --> 02:24:20,610
I had no idea what it was going to happen.

2324
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:26,210
My lawyer told me I was possibly
looking at two and a half years in jail.

2325
02:24:32,760 --> 02:24:37,380
Rough. Yeah, I remember
that butterfly very vividly.

2326
02:24:38,210 --> 02:24:39,043
Happy.
Yo

2327
02:24:42,990 --> 02:24:47,420
get that. You get that.
I don't want to pat.

2328
02:24:48,110 --> 02:24:52,290
It's also a prison was not in France.
Yeah,

2329
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:55,920
it's like whatever islands. They were
all there. It was a prison. I went,

2330
02:24:55,921 --> 02:24:57,330
it was no joke,
man.

2331
02:24:57,331 --> 02:25:01,740
Prison as a no joke prisoner and you know,

2332
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:05,460
we always find the good in things.
And you got a visitor that came to visit

2333
02:25:07,120 --> 02:25:09,010
a woman by the name of Laura.
Yes.

2334
02:25:09,330 --> 02:25:11,820
Who's now goes by the name
of Laura Lee Flanagan.

2335
02:25:13,490 --> 02:25:17,850
And uh, she was, she
had interviewed you for,

2336
02:25:18,060 --> 02:25:19,970
for what? For what website? Uh,

2337
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:24,070
she had a website called
New York natives.com and,

2338
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,220
um,
yeah,

2339
02:25:26,440 --> 02:25:29,440
they did a lot of stories
and then you know,

2340
02:25:29,441 --> 02:25:34,030
about things happening in the city and
interesting people in this and that and

2341
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:38,800
blogs and stuff.
And she interviewed me as a,

2342
02:25:38,801 --> 02:25:42,520
a native icon, uh, because, um, you know,

2343
02:25:42,521 --> 02:25:45,790
you wouldn't know it from looking at
her and, or by her career. I mean,

2344
02:25:45,791 --> 02:25:49,060
she's a lawyer and she's, you
know, from the upper east side,

2345
02:25:49,061 --> 02:25:52,420
she's amazing. And, um,

2346
02:25:52,930 --> 02:25:56,620
she used to be in the hardcore for
a brief moment in her childhood,

2347
02:25:57,310 --> 02:26:01,960
so she knew of the chrome eggs.
She had seen us play. And,

2348
02:26:01,961 --> 02:26:05,800
um, a friend of hers, a, they were doing,

2349
02:26:06,390 --> 02:26:10,900
she did a story on c squat, a squat
that I used to live in, you know,

2350
02:26:11,050 --> 02:26:14,710
and um, it was really a good
story. It was very interesting.

2351
02:26:14,711 --> 02:26:17,110
And one of the people she
spoke to around that time said,

2352
02:26:17,111 --> 02:26:18,460
you should speak to Harley.

2353
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:23,080
He used to live there and
he'd be interesting for you
know, for you to interview.

2354
02:26:23,081 --> 02:26:27,970
And she, uh, pursued it
and uh, we started talking,

2355
02:26:27,971 --> 02:26:28,804
um,

2356
02:26:29,680 --> 02:26:34,680
we did the interview and I started sending
her some chapters of this book that I

2357
02:26:36,371 --> 02:26:39,790
was still working on at the time.
And uh,

2358
02:26:43,090 --> 02:26:45,820
I don't remember how exactly
it came about. I mean,

2359
02:26:45,821 --> 02:26:50,590
she has a phd and she's done a lot of
writing and stuff in her life and a lot of

2360
02:26:50,591 --> 02:26:51,460
editing and stuff.

2361
02:26:51,461 --> 02:26:56,440
And she really enjoyed the book and I
needed some help in the editing. I mean,

2362
02:26:56,441 --> 02:26:59,800
I have a seventh grade education,
so there was,

2363
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:01,750
the book was basically one sentence

2364
02:27:02,240 --> 02:27:03,140
when I gave it to her,

2365
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:09,170
she gets the award for like
entity and challenges. No Shit.

2366
02:27:09,440 --> 02:27:13,460
I mean they were, it was better tonight.
I was like, yeah, you edited the book.

2367
02:27:13,461 --> 02:27:16,700
And then we, cause I was an English
major too and we had a moment of like,

2368
02:27:16,701 --> 02:27:20,560
I'm mute. I gave her a moment of
mutual respect and admiration.

2369
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:27,110
I mean this book would it okay,
it's like 300 pages.

2370
02:27:27,111 --> 02:27:30,620
It would have been a thousand pages.
And it was like I said,

2371
02:27:30,621 --> 02:27:34,730
it was one sentence and we
literally had to like, okay,

2372
02:27:34,731 --> 02:27:39,731
we've got 10 stories about fighting
now can we lose these other 20 okay,

2373
02:27:39,951 --> 02:27:42,980
we've got 10 stories about
like almost overdosing.

2374
02:27:42,981 --> 02:27:46,400
Can we lose the other 30
okay. We've got, you know,

2375
02:27:47,110 --> 02:27:48,220
so there was a,

2376
02:27:49,190 --> 02:27:52,760
you know, I mean it would have
been a fucking endless book.

2377
02:27:52,761 --> 02:27:56,270
I mean I took a lot of fights and a
lot of drugs and a lot of rock and roll

2378
02:27:56,271 --> 02:28:00,800
dumbness and just a lot of actually
a good stories didn't make it in,

2379
02:28:01,340 --> 02:28:03,320
you know,
but I think,

2380
02:28:03,530 --> 02:28:08,090
I think we got left with a pretty
good picture of everything.

2381
02:28:08,360 --> 02:28:12,170
You know everybody, it's actually funny
because when I had the book signing,

2382
02:28:12,200 --> 02:28:15,770
a lot of people that I went to school
with and like fifth and sixth grade from

2383
02:28:15,771 --> 02:28:18,680
my neighborhood showed up and they
were like, dude, you nailed it man.

2384
02:28:18,681 --> 02:28:22,130
You described the neighborhood. So, and

2385
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:25,280
the funny shit is actually one of the
hit men and the guys from my block was at

2386
02:28:25,281 --> 02:28:27,710
my book signing and I actually
asked him, I was like, dude,

2387
02:28:29,450 --> 02:28:33,860
who the fuck was pig man?
And he's like,

2388
02:28:33,950 --> 02:28:38,030
oh man, that was crazy. Eddie and
crazy. Eddie was a brand of PCP.

2389
02:28:38,031 --> 02:28:40,940
We all used to smoke back then. So I'm
sure that's why he got the nickname.

2390
02:28:41,390 --> 02:28:44,000
But um, he's like, yeah
man, you know, he's,

2391
02:28:44,010 --> 02:28:48,710
he's got an auto body shop down,
grandkids, blah, blah, blah,

2392
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:52,660
like word, you know? I like, well
tell him I said, what's up? You know?

2393
02:28:53,330 --> 02:28:57,230
But it was funny because literally like
all that actually mattered more to me

2394
02:28:57,231 --> 02:29:01,190
than the reviews of the book was
when I had people who were shared,

2395
02:29:01,191 --> 02:29:04,190
those experiences and people
who grew up in the neighborhood.

2396
02:29:04,640 --> 02:29:07,190
I mean even more so than the cro mags,
parts of the books,

2397
02:29:07,191 --> 02:29:09,830
like the people who are like,
Yo, you fucking nailed it man.

2398
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:11,570
This is exactly what the city was like.

2399
02:29:11,571 --> 02:29:13,850
I try to tell people all the
time and they don't get it.

2400
02:29:13,851 --> 02:29:17,450
So I bought them a copy just so
they can fucking see for themselves.

2401
02:29:18,050 --> 02:29:22,460
That was when I knew that I nailed
it. You know, that that was,

2402
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:24,410
that was,
you know,

2403
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:27,410
there was a couple of publishers
that didn't want to put
it out there. Like, yeah,

2404
02:29:27,411 --> 02:29:32,170
we can't touch this.
Like, Hey, you know how,

2405
02:29:32,240 --> 02:29:37,240
you know how your wife had to lose like
20 to fight stories and I had to do for

2406
02:29:37,611 --> 02:29:39,020
this podcast, I got
rid of their, you know,

2407
02:29:39,021 --> 02:29:42,200
we discussed a fraction of the
crazy shit that's in here. Nah,

2408
02:29:42,260 --> 02:29:43,460
I mean we haven't even touched,

2409
02:29:43,461 --> 02:29:48,461
I mean we could sit here and talk for
the fucking till tomorrow and you know,

2410
02:29:48,801 --> 02:29:49,634
but uh,

2411
02:29:50,060 --> 02:29:54,770
but I do, you know, I just, the book gets
it across and that's why like I said,

2412
02:29:54,800 --> 02:29:59,480
I thought I was familiar with
the hardcore scene and factually,

2413
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:01,700
I mean I went to CBGBS,
I don't know,

2414
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:07,550
hundreds of times when I was a kid and
all shows all over the east coast. Boston.

2415
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:08,810
Yeah.
So,

2416
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:13,840
but I still didn't recognize
that there was this much chaos

2417
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:18,350
and speaking to chaos,
I'm going to go back to the book here.

2418
02:30:18,770 --> 02:30:20,570
You're sitting in jail and here we go.

2419
02:30:20,571 --> 02:30:23,060
Because all the people talking
shit and trying to frame me.

2420
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:26,510
The record label I'd just signed
with was having second thoughts.

2421
02:30:26,810 --> 02:30:30,770
Everything was coming to a head and now
I had to prepare for a court date facing

2422
02:30:30,771 --> 02:30:35,570
four felony counts of second degree
assault and weapons charges for biting and

2423
02:30:35,571 --> 02:30:40,190
stabbing people.
If there was ever and I teach the kids.

2424
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:45,620
If there was ever a time that
I was about to lose my shit,

2425
02:30:45,621 --> 02:30:47,270
I'd have to say it was around this time.

2426
02:30:47,271 --> 02:30:51,320
If there was ever a time someone
would relapse into drugs,

2427
02:30:51,321 --> 02:30:55,010
alcohol or some self destructive shit.
It was a time like this.

2428
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:58,040
I actually went out and
got drunk a few nights,

2429
02:30:58,041 --> 02:31:01,070
which I hadn't done in a long time.
I was really depressed.

2430
02:31:01,970 --> 02:31:05,450
I was really at the bottom.
I could have easily spun out of control,

2431
02:31:05,540 --> 02:31:07,730
but I said to myself,
fuck that.

2432
02:31:08,420 --> 02:31:12,860
I'm not going to let myself go and do
that to myself or my kids or give in and

2433
02:31:12,861 --> 02:31:16,940
give the satisfaction to my enemies.
I'm a black belt.

2434
02:31:17,570 --> 02:31:19,410
I have more control than that now.

2435
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:23,430
I'm not who I once was.
I'm stronger than that.

2436
02:31:25,870 --> 02:31:26,703
And then

2437
02:31:29,400 --> 02:31:34,400
the next court date I wound up getting
a d an adjournment again because they

2438
02:31:35,191 --> 02:31:36,990
didn't have a case against me.
And again,

2439
02:31:36,991 --> 02:31:41,670
it got pushed back while the DA continue
to try and build it until finally in

2440
02:31:41,671 --> 02:31:46,671
December of 2012 they contacted my lawyer
and said to appear in court on Friday,

2441
02:31:46,681 --> 02:31:51,570
December 14th when the
entire case was dismissed.

2442
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:57,200
Yeah. And Yeah,

2443
02:31:59,310 --> 02:32:00,143
you

2444
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:03,120
at that point, you know, you
kind of get back on track. Yeah.

2445
02:32:03,330 --> 02:32:06,510
And you're teaching Jujitsu like you said.

2446
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:09,250
And there's a good quote here
when you're teaching Jujitsu,

2447
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:13,020
after you had the incident at Webster
Hall and what are the parents said,

2448
02:32:13,650 --> 02:32:13,930
you know,

2449
02:32:13,930 --> 02:32:16,560
when into here he comes back to start
teaching the kids class again after he's

2450
02:32:16,561 --> 02:32:19,920
been all over the front page of all the
papers and everybody's looking at me

2451
02:32:19,921 --> 02:32:20,754
like,
oh shit.

2452
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:24,810
I walked in the academy and like every
half the people were super happy to see

2453
02:32:24,811 --> 02:32:28,140
me in there. They have looked at me like
so like a gunslinger just walked in.

2454
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:32,190
I was like, you know, fucking wild west.

2455
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:37,050
One of them, one of the moms, one of
the moms was quoted as saying, well,

2456
02:32:37,051 --> 02:32:40,050
at least I know my kid isn't
getting taught Jujitsu by a pussy.

2457
02:32:42,050 --> 02:32:44,640
Yeah. That was why that fucking
data hands, Hanzo laugh.

2458
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:47,820
And yet there's still,
um,

2459
02:32:48,270 --> 02:32:51,630
there's still hard times
because at this point you're,

2460
02:32:51,790 --> 02:32:55,970
you're losing custody of your kids. Yeah.
And that was, you know, that's, you know,

2461
02:32:55,980 --> 02:32:56,940
I gotta tell you it means

2462
02:32:59,010 --> 02:33:01,810
that has been the,
the biggest

2463
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:07,150
trial and tribulation I've dealt with.

2464
02:33:07,420 --> 02:33:10,660
Obviously I've dealt with
many, but, uh, you know,

2465
02:33:10,661 --> 02:33:12,760
especially someone who didn't really have

2466
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:18,280
responsible people like really

2467
02:33:20,910 --> 02:33:22,860
raising me. You know, I,

2468
02:33:23,490 --> 02:33:28,110
it really hurts to not be there
for your kids every day. You know,

2469
02:33:28,170 --> 02:33:32,070
cause I really, I used to cherish those
moments more than anything. I mean,

2470
02:33:32,071 --> 02:33:35,580
just walking them to school in the morning
and the little conversations we would

2471
02:33:35,581 --> 02:33:38,730
have on the way to school and,
you know,

2472
02:33:39,540 --> 02:33:40,140
okay.

2473
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:44,420
Taking them to Jiu Jitsu and, you
know, I really was the, uh, this,

2474
02:33:44,510 --> 02:33:48,680
the main caretaker. I was with them all
day. You know, I did everything with them,

2475
02:33:48,681 --> 02:33:51,490
took them to the parks and
museums have this. That's isn't,

2476
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:54,920
and to then have that taken away,

2477
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:01,650
it's difficult to, again, to not

2478
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:06,470
start fucking up, you know,
especially when you're

2479
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:12,270
dealing with depression and
all that shit again. You know,

2480
02:34:12,450 --> 02:34:14,130
it's just like, uh, like I said, you know,

2481
02:34:14,131 --> 02:34:17,560
we don't have someone to
love and to feel that,

2482
02:34:17,570 --> 02:34:21,100
that reciprocation and, and, uh,

2483
02:34:22,570 --> 02:34:26,470
you don't feel needed. It's hard
to not feel needed, you know.

2484
02:34:28,330 --> 02:34:32,160
But I, uh, all right. You know,

2485
02:34:32,161 --> 02:34:35,040
I went through all the process of
family court and this and that, and, uh,

2486
02:34:35,070 --> 02:34:39,780
you know, unfortunately they don't live
with me full time, but I see them a lot.

2487
02:34:39,781 --> 02:34:43,520
And, um, you know, everybody knows who's
been through a divorce and as kids, right?

2488
02:34:43,770 --> 02:34:47,310
Fortunately, I was never married to
their mother. Hallelujah. But, um,

2489
02:34:47,430 --> 02:34:49,670
anybody who's been in
that situation knows it's,

2490
02:34:49,671 --> 02:34:52,920
it's not easy and it comes with
a lot of challenges. And, uh,

2491
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:56,610
so now my challenge is,
is to try to

2492
02:34:58,380 --> 02:35:01,430
be involved with my kids'
lives as much as I can and to,

2493
02:35:01,490 --> 02:35:06,490
to try to give them some moral
guidance and a manhood guidance from,

2494
02:35:09,410 --> 02:35:13,850
from a distance, you know, and
sadly, they didn't see, you know,

2495
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:17,670
me and their mother act like complete
and total savages towards the end of the

2496
02:35:17,700 --> 02:35:19,620
relationship because people,
when they break up,

2497
02:35:19,621 --> 02:35:23,940
they typically don't know how to act
or behave even in front of their kids.

2498
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:26,040
So,
but you know what,

2499
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:32,660
even all of this is made me a stronger
and wiser person because I feel that it

2500
02:35:33,931 --> 02:35:38,910
has again forced me to look at myself.
And,

2501
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:39,773
uh,

2502
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:46,200
you have choices in every situation,
how you're going to react and how you,

2503
02:35:46,530 --> 02:35:47,730
you know,
what you're going to do.

2504
02:35:47,780 --> 02:35:52,350
And now I really think about
the consequences of everything.

2505
02:35:53,010 --> 02:35:58,010
I know I can't just react
explosively if somebody

2506
02:36:02,430 --> 02:36:05,520
does or says something to me on the
street because I know that that could cost

2507
02:36:05,521 --> 02:36:07,740
me my freedom.
It could cost that my kids,

2508
02:36:07,741 --> 02:36:12,360
their father could cause
my wife or husband. So,

2509
02:36:12,361 --> 02:36:13,620
you know,
even

2510
02:36:15,390 --> 02:36:20,390
even losing my kids has been a
learning experience that I hope,

2511
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:24,410
God forbid, they ever,
you know, wind up, um,

2512
02:36:24,450 --> 02:36:26,520
with kids in separated and this and that.

2513
02:36:26,521 --> 02:36:31,521
But hopefully even this bad stuff can
help them become better men and smarter

2514
02:36:33,331 --> 02:36:37,080
men and hopefully better,
smarter than I was,

2515
02:36:38,880 --> 02:36:42,840
you know? And uh, I just try to,

2516
02:36:42,990 --> 02:36:47,640
I try to believe really that, that
in the end love wins, you know?

2517
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:52,393
Okay.

2518
02:36:52,780 --> 02:36:53,800
Yeah.
Um,

2519
02:36:55,100 --> 02:36:55,740
okay.

2520
02:36:55,740 --> 02:36:55,961
There were,

2521
02:36:55,961 --> 02:37:00,961
so one more thing that you
had to overcome in the book

2522
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:05,260
and you know, sometimes, man,

2523
02:37:05,261 --> 02:37:10,261
I just read a big chunk of the books
that I'm reviewing because it's just,

2524
02:37:11,701 --> 02:37:16,580
uh, uh, uh, the way it's written in a
way it goes and the story that it tells,

2525
02:37:16,610 --> 02:37:20,720
I just don't really want to change it.
I just want to put it out there.

2526
02:37:20,721 --> 02:37:23,390
So I'm Kinda gonna do that right here.

2527
02:37:27,310 --> 02:37:31,450
After all the madness in my life and the
recent drama surrounding Webster Hall,

2528
02:37:31,630 --> 02:37:34,630
my arrest, losing my kids,
starting a new relationship,

2529
02:37:34,631 --> 02:37:38,470
getting my kids back in my
life and dealing with all
the drama of family court.

2530
02:37:39,790 --> 02:37:41,890
My mom was stricken with terminal cancer.

2531
02:37:43,670 --> 02:37:44,280
Okay.

2532
02:37:44,280 --> 02:37:47,340
After a major operation in
what seemed like a recovery,

2533
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:49,470
things took a turn for the worse.

2534
02:37:50,820 --> 02:37:51,520
Okay.

2535
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:52,353
Through it all,

2536
02:37:52,440 --> 02:37:56,550
she remained supportive in my battle
for my kids and I started spending a lot

2537
02:37:56,551 --> 02:37:57,840
more time with her.

2538
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:03,260
It's fucked up when you know
your mom or dad is dying.

2539
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:04,550
Okay.

2540
02:38:04,550 --> 02:38:08,660
You go through your whole life with all
the baggage and shit that they put on

2541
02:38:08,661 --> 02:38:13,190
you and all the shit in the world and
your friends put on you and then there

2542
02:38:13,191 --> 02:38:17,150
comes a time when you realize
you have to put it all down.

2543
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:19,170
Yeah.

2544
02:38:19,170 --> 02:38:20,430
Then just let it all go.

2545
02:38:22,940 --> 02:38:26,510
I was with her as much as possible
during the last few months.

2546
02:38:27,140 --> 02:38:31,100
We spent more time together than we had
in years. We even left the city one day,

2547
02:38:31,101 --> 02:38:36,101
just a month before she died to
spend some time at a horse stable.

2548
02:38:37,490 --> 02:38:40,790
She loved horses and she hadn't been
around them since she was a child.

2549
02:38:42,760 --> 02:38:45,550
She said it was the most
beautiful day in her entire life,

2550
02:38:48,070 --> 02:38:52,270
and later she spent the night and then
the next three nights at my apartment,

2551
02:38:54,110 --> 02:38:58,070
we had such a good time that
she completely forgot to
take her pain medication.

2552
02:39:00,150 --> 02:39:05,150
I hope I can face death with as much
dignity the way she has handled it.

2553
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:08,730
I've never seen a braver
person in my life.

2554
02:39:09,690 --> 02:39:12,090
She makes all the men I
know look like cowards.

2555
02:39:13,470 --> 02:39:13,970
Okay.

2556
02:39:13,970 --> 02:39:17,660
Sadly, she only saw my kids
twice during her last few months,

2557
02:39:18,290 --> 02:39:21,920
but the time that they spent together was
amazing and very meaningful and picked

2558
02:39:21,921 --> 02:39:22,880
up her spirits.

2559
02:39:23,680 --> 02:39:24,150
Okay.

2560
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,983
And I don't know.

2561
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,520
And I know that she took great comfort
in the fact that I'm finally in a place

2562
02:39:28,521 --> 02:39:31,370
in my life where things are
coming together in a positive way.

2563
02:39:32,270 --> 02:39:32,870
Okay.

2564
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:36,320
I just wish she could have
been here with us longer.

2565
02:39:37,900 --> 02:39:38,550
Yeah.

2566
02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:43,500
She died Monday, June 15th, 2015

2567
02:39:46,230 --> 02:39:47,063
okay.

2568
02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:51,420
At the funeral, her ashes were
carried out and placed on a table.

2569
02:39:52,580 --> 02:39:53,030
Okay.

2570
02:39:53,030 --> 02:39:55,190
They weren't a box.
Not meant to be buried.

2571
02:39:56,210 --> 02:39:59,360
A beautiful statue of a crying angel.

2572
02:40:00,960 --> 02:40:01,620
Yeah.

2573
02:40:01,620 --> 02:40:04,680
We all took part in
reading from Bible verses.

2574
02:40:05,640 --> 02:40:09,030
I held onto my son, Jonah,
and he cried quietly.

2575
02:40:10,110 --> 02:40:13,980
My son hardly stood behind me
with my girlfriend trying to

2576
02:40:13,980 --> 02:40:16,710
keep his composure.
As tears rolled down his face

2577
02:40:18,400 --> 02:40:22,360
at the end of the service,
a slight drizzle of rain started again.

2578
02:40:24,040 --> 02:40:27,820
When everyone was done consoling each
other and people started walking away.

2579
02:40:28,420 --> 02:40:33,250
I looked at the box sitting on the table
surrounded by flowers with the hole in

2580
02:40:33,251 --> 02:40:34,660
the ground beside it.

2581
02:40:35,960 --> 02:40:36,500
Yeah,

2582
02:40:36,500 --> 02:40:41,500
to cemetery workers arrived with shovels
and a rake and I walked back and asked

2583
02:40:41,631 --> 02:40:45,830
if I could cover her with soil
myself as I don't from my father.

2584
02:40:45,831 --> 02:40:47,120
13 years earlier,

2585
02:40:49,060 --> 02:40:52,870
I explained that I didn't feel right
about someone who didn't know my mother

2586
02:40:52,871 --> 02:40:54,010
covering her with dirt.

2587
02:40:55,620 --> 02:40:56,120
Yeah,

2588
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:57,020
they understood.

2589
02:40:58,550 --> 02:40:59,383
Okay.

2590
02:40:59,420 --> 02:41:04,310
I thank them. I took the box
with the angel off the table.

2591
02:41:06,110 --> 02:41:06,943
I kissed it.

2592
02:41:07,700 --> 02:41:12,700
My son's kissed it and I got down on
my knees and put it in the ground.

2593
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:19,440
I wonder. The cemetery workers handed me
a shovel and I started to fill the hole.

2594
02:41:21,350 --> 02:41:24,980
My youngest son who'd been
crying came over next to me.

2595
02:41:25,040 --> 02:41:28,220
Got on his knees and started to help
me fill the hole with his hands,

2596
02:41:28,760 --> 02:41:30,890
grabbing pieces of soil
and putting them in,

2597
02:41:31,250 --> 02:41:35,690
picking out rocks so none would
damage her box as we filled it.

2598
02:41:36,970 --> 02:41:37,660
Okay.

2599
02:41:37,660 --> 02:41:38,740
And his tears stopped.

2600
02:41:39,650 --> 02:41:40,320
Okay.

2601
02:41:40,320 --> 02:41:45,320
I put down the shovel and we both
finished by hand and then I raked the soil

2602
02:41:45,781 --> 02:41:50,780
over and we pat it down the earth
with our hands and it was done.

2603
02:41:53,360 --> 02:41:56,240
It was so sad and so beautiful.

2604
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:02,190
The next day was father's day.

2605
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:04,853
Okay.

2606
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:06,320
When I started writing this book,

2607
02:42:07,310 --> 02:42:11,030
I didn't know what the end was going
to be or what I wanted to say besides

2608
02:42:11,031 --> 02:42:14,260
telling the story of my life
and setting the record straight.

2609
02:42:16,130 --> 02:42:19,790
But now it's so obvious what is about

2610
02:42:22,200 --> 02:42:23,033
closure

2611
02:42:41,040 --> 02:42:41,873
and that

2612
02:42:47,890 --> 02:42:50,170
that wraps up the book.
Yeah.

2613
02:42:53,630 --> 02:42:54,463
And

2614
02:42:58,330 --> 02:43:02,920
look,
no one has lived a perfect life.

2615
02:43:05,240 --> 02:43:09,830
We've all made mistakes. We've all
done things that can't be on dawn,

2616
02:43:09,831 --> 02:43:12,040
and we've gone places
that we should not have

2617
02:43:12,040 --> 02:43:12,873
gone,

2618
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:20,930
but we all have the opportunity
to redeem ourselves.

2619
02:43:24,850 --> 02:43:28,140
And it starts with
confessing what we've done.

2620
02:43:28,141 --> 02:43:31,980
It starts with owning it and then getting
on the right path and staying on the

2621
02:43:31,981 --> 02:43:32,814
right path

2622
02:43:36,240 --> 02:43:41,170
and staying on that path,
the correct path.

2623
02:43:42,390 --> 02:43:47,390
It takes discipline and it takes humility
and it takes courage and it's hard,

2624
02:43:52,910 --> 02:43:56,870
but
what is the other choice?

2625
02:44:01,230 --> 02:44:02,280
What else can we do?

2626
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:06,420
Let the darkness completely consume us.

2627
02:44:06,570 --> 02:44:10,680
Live for instant gratification.
Wherever we can find it.

2628
02:44:10,681 --> 02:44:15,590
Be over taken
by temptation.

2629
02:44:17,110 --> 02:44:18,010
Advice.

2630
02:44:21,650 --> 02:44:22,483
No,

2631
02:44:25,780 --> 02:44:30,470
do not accept that.
I,

2632
02:44:30,850 --> 02:44:35,850
I hear from a lot of people that
struggle with all these things.

2633
02:44:37,311 --> 02:44:40,160
They're caught,
they're drowning.

2634
02:44:41,940 --> 02:44:42,550
Okay?

2635
02:44:42,550 --> 02:44:47,550
They're folding under the weight of pain
and suffering and misery and addiction

2636
02:44:55,910 --> 02:44:58,010
and they asked me what I think.

2637
02:45:03,120 --> 02:45:06,720
Well, what I think Nan,

2638
02:45:06,721 --> 02:45:08,970
what Harley proves is that

2639
02:45:10,600 --> 02:45:11,740
you are better than that.

2640
02:45:15,020 --> 02:45:19,610
You are better and you can try
on flow over these dark forces.

2641
02:45:19,910 --> 02:45:23,120
You can become better.
You can be better

2642
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:28,990
for yourself and for
the people around you.

2643
02:45:30,960 --> 02:45:32,160
For all of us,

2644
02:45:36,580 --> 02:45:37,540
hold the line,

2645
02:45:41,460 --> 02:45:42,600
stay clean,

2646
02:45:46,030 --> 02:45:46,863
okay.

2647
02:45:47,840 --> 02:45:49,070
And never surrender.

2648
02:46:01,880 --> 02:46:03,470
You overcame a lot of stuff,
man.

2649
02:46:09,950 --> 02:46:10,160
I

2650
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:14,060
have and I'm still trying,
you know?

2651
02:46:16,780 --> 02:46:17,613
Yeah,

2652
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:25,610
I guess everyone is.
Yeah.

2653
02:46:28,690 --> 02:46:30,490
This is the time in the podcast.

2654
02:46:33,270 --> 02:46:37,110
Why we have that coherence.
One of the many reasons

2655
02:46:39,080 --> 02:46:43,930
because where do we get a
chance to decompress a little
bit. Yes. Fully, fully.

2656
02:46:44,590 --> 02:46:49,400
He gets to ask a couple questions. It
plagued my mind a little quick. Yeah.

2657
02:46:49,480 --> 02:46:52,240
You know, like when after the
thing where'd they stop wearing

2658
02:46:53,070 --> 02:46:57,620
and my leg. Um, I mean
it's, you can see when I was

2659
02:46:58,040 --> 02:46:59,870
oh yeah, yeah. Like
lower lake. Yeah. Yeah.

2660
02:46:59,871 --> 02:47:03,050
Cause you were saying the thought or
they thought it was a compound fracture.

2661
02:47:03,080 --> 02:47:06,380
Yeah. Cause you know Fisher is white.
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Tagging out.

2662
02:47:06,381 --> 02:47:08,400
So everybody thought that was
bowling. It was sticking out. Yeah.

2663
02:47:08,430 --> 02:47:11,800
That it make sense down there. But kind
of by your Shin, like in your thigh,

2664
02:47:11,850 --> 02:47:13,460
be like compound fracture that yeah.
No,

2665
02:47:13,461 --> 02:47:17,650
I didn't even know it happened until I
was coughed on the floor or I'll see it.

2666
02:47:17,651 --> 02:47:21,500
And that's so crazy. Like when
you're in the moment so much. Yeah.

2667
02:47:21,620 --> 02:47:25,540
Well you can get straight up, stab,
stab with your stuff, hanging out,

2668
02:47:25,950 --> 02:47:30,490
going to be hanging off and you'd
be like, okay, what's next? Okay.

2669
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:35,150
Oh, is that all my cases off all day?
Oh, can I help you? Here's your eyeball.

2670
02:47:35,151 --> 02:47:39,700
Thanks.
Yeah.

2671
02:47:39,810 --> 02:47:41,260
Uh,
I mean that's why,

2672
02:47:41,620 --> 02:47:46,120
that's why I'm so sketchy when it
comes to like, as much as I, you know,

2673
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:49,390
I got admitted like that shit was fun.

2674
02:47:49,900 --> 02:47:53,850
I like a good adrenaline.
It's like a,

2675
02:47:53,851 --> 02:47:57,550
a good violent confrontation.
Look,

2676
02:47:57,551 --> 02:48:00,790
good fight is fun,
but

2677
02:48:03,090 --> 02:48:07,380
it was also like life and death,

2678
02:48:07,770 --> 02:48:09,990
you know? So it's like, you know,
like I was saying, you know,

2679
02:48:09,991 --> 02:48:13,650
like I had that one fight and California
where I'm running into a mob of all

2680
02:48:13,651 --> 02:48:17,370
these dudes. Like, you know, I was
high off that shit for like a week.

2681
02:48:17,371 --> 02:48:18,140
My adrenaline,

2682
02:48:18,140 --> 02:48:23,040
it's like, ah, I felt like
I could fucking raw. Yeah.

2683
02:48:23,800 --> 02:48:28,140
And then like a week later, I'm like, what
the fuck man? Yeah. What was that shit?

2684
02:48:28,450 --> 02:48:29,820
You know?
So like

2685
02:48:30,040 --> 02:48:31,850
as much as you know. Yeah. It was fun.

2686
02:48:32,170 --> 02:48:34,840
How often do you get to have a
street fight anymore? You know, Shit.

2687
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:35,860
Especially at my age.

2688
02:48:37,090 --> 02:48:41,380
You guys, good time, man. But
it was all the other shit,

2689
02:48:41,381 --> 02:48:44,590
all the fucking ripple effects
that came along. We're like, fuck,

2690
02:48:44,591 --> 02:48:47,980
I may not see my kids. Fuck, I may be
in jail. Fuck of the next three years.

2691
02:48:47,981 --> 02:48:51,930
Like fucking, you know, protecting
my ass for bubbles over here. Yeah.

2692
02:48:52,020 --> 02:48:56,130
I'm like fucking, you know, those shit
was like, damn man, can we forget Kate,

2693
02:48:56,131 --> 02:48:59,490
we just all get along. Okay. We all
just have a street fight, you know,

2694
02:48:59,600 --> 02:49:04,410
and just like, can't we all just have
a Steve ride get on with our Shit,

2695
02:49:04,411 --> 02:49:05,244
you know?

2696
02:49:05,400 --> 02:49:08,040
But you know, but you know, shit

2697
02:49:08,040 --> 02:49:12,510
happens man. We going to do man. Yeah.
When you put everything into perspective,

2698
02:49:12,540 --> 02:49:17,260
the whole getting into street
fights doesn't seem quite
as dope. Yeah. You know,

2699
02:49:17,350 --> 02:49:21,840
it changes when you got responsibilities.
That's the thing.

2700
02:49:21,841 --> 02:49:26,470
The responsibilities anyway.
Speaking a responsibility,

2701
02:49:26,590 --> 02:49:30,590
responsibility. We're not
getting any younger. Um,

2702
02:49:30,600 --> 02:49:33,930
so we'll talk about on at first as always.
Um,

2703
02:49:34,260 --> 02:49:38,800
so on it supplements, you
know, you know, but on it, no,

2704
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,400
most people use just to know, but
on oh, and the west coast, they do.

2705
02:49:41,580 --> 02:49:42,900
I think that's how you mother fuckers,

2706
02:49:43,630 --> 02:49:48,630
you are [inaudible] need to get on it.

2707
02:49:48,800 --> 02:49:51,130
Yo.
Yo what the fuck is up with on it?

2708
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:52,970
True.
But here endure.

2709
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:55,680
And that's what I thought too with
supplements where it's like, yeah,

2710
02:49:55,681 --> 02:49:57,180
it takes up him until they get you big.

2711
02:49:57,181 --> 02:49:58,920
I found that that's not
necessarily the case.

2712
02:49:58,980 --> 02:50:03,630
So the supplements that I take the we
take, therefore like you got a suitcase,

2713
02:50:03,631 --> 02:50:04,464
which I'm in him.

2714
02:50:05,890 --> 02:50:10,890
I'll get you [inaudible]
been on other shit.

2715
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:16,550
[inaudible] this is stuff that's good.
This is legal.

2716
02:50:17,660 --> 02:50:18,890
I want you to be on the right stuff

2717
02:50:22,130 --> 02:50:24,620
towards the light.
The light is on it.

2718
02:50:27,760 --> 02:50:30,300
You know how like, like
for example, the one,

2719
02:50:30,330 --> 02:50:34,790
the ones that I take,
we take now because Krill oil

2720
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:39,240
for inflammation and shit like that.
You're exactly right.

2721
02:50:41,250 --> 02:50:45,480
So the so on, it is like a real reputable
company that, um, like, you know,

2722
02:50:45,481 --> 02:50:46,780
you're getting,
because right,

2723
02:50:46,920 --> 02:50:51,840
you can get supplements and you're
getting like they say a Krill and you're

2724
02:50:51,841 --> 02:50:53,280
getting like fucking,
you know,

2725
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:58,450
rat Rach bladder oil or some shit,
you know? And they'll be like, yeah,

2726
02:50:58,500 --> 02:50:59,970
that's cool.
Yeah.

2727
02:51:01,060 --> 02:51:04,240
The rest of it's own vitamin
e Joe. Yes, exactly. Right.

2728
02:51:04,241 --> 02:51:07,450
So this is like known to be the best.

2729
02:51:08,440 --> 02:51:12,070
I'm going to have to get down. Actually
I'll read the, you know the main guy,

2730
02:51:12,071 --> 02:51:15,820
his like he has an extensive
background in like uptake.

2731
02:51:15,850 --> 02:51:20,470
You know how like you can get a calcium
supplement but that supplement won't

2732
02:51:20,471 --> 02:51:24,190
deliver the uptake so your body doesn't
deny even breaking it down or absorbing

2733
02:51:24,191 --> 02:51:26,220
it. Yes, exactly. So this only snow,

2734
02:51:26,240 --> 02:51:28,650
there's a lot of different
vitamins and all that shit. I,

2735
02:51:28,670 --> 02:51:33,460
I tried to get all my vitamins
through food. Yes. You know,

2736
02:51:33,490 --> 02:51:35,770
if I can, you know. Yeah, that's optimal.

2737
02:51:36,010 --> 02:51:39,910
So that's kind of the point there were
like, yeah, when you get it with food,

2738
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:43,780
you know that you're going to get the
best uptake for the most part. You know,

2739
02:51:43,781 --> 02:51:45,800
if you, if you're getting
your, you know, I dunno,

2740
02:51:46,510 --> 02:51:49,120
protein from soy beans or
something, you know, something,

2741
02:51:49,121 --> 02:51:52,840
I don't get as much protein as you
animals over here. I'm a vegetarian.

2742
02:51:53,440 --> 02:51:57,160
I have been since like 82
or something like that,

2743
02:51:57,190 --> 02:52:02,140
which I also think is one of the reasons
why I managed to maintain a certain

2744
02:52:02,141 --> 02:52:06,790
level of health and sanity
despite all the drugs.

2745
02:52:06,810 --> 02:52:09,250
I think that that actually,
you know, helped me.

2746
02:52:09,560 --> 02:52:14,120
The wheat grass [inaudible] hey,
hey,

2747
02:52:14,121 --> 02:52:16,830
everyone was listening to a podcast.
If you're shooting up heroin

2748
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:23,290
and always wear a condom when
you're shooting your hair. Yes,

2749
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:27,140
good Lord. Well, yeah, you figure
that's optimal from the food,

2750
02:52:27,350 --> 02:52:29,420
but on it like they like Vaco.
Good job

2751
02:52:29,650 --> 02:52:33,690
in knowing like the optimum way to
uptake. Like the nutrients. Yeah,

2752
02:52:33,691 --> 02:52:37,150
I found that out nice. That's like,
you know, I was like, you know,

2753
02:52:37,151 --> 02:52:41,470
that's a good one. Anyway, one of the
reasons. So we do krill oil, strong bone,

2754
02:52:41,471 --> 02:52:44,200
new one. I just started. Jack always
does it for your, for your joints.

2755
02:52:44,201 --> 02:52:48,970
So you do know I have some joint
issues after a while. That's how,

2756
02:52:49,310 --> 02:52:53,240
and yeah, the, and the crude oil
helps a lot. A lot. A lot. That's the,

2757
02:52:53,320 --> 02:52:56,080
I'd say that's the number
one that I would recommend.

2758
02:52:57,730 --> 02:53:00,640
I'd recommend a few more other things too,
but just for different reasons.

2759
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:04,090
Like to have this one warrior Bart's buff
while you're vegetarian, so nevermind.

2760
02:53:05,020 --> 02:53:06,720
Buffalo, buffalo meat. Maybe.

2761
02:53:06,840 --> 02:53:09,910
You know how like they make
not necessarily no buffalo
meats better for you?

2762
02:53:09,911 --> 02:53:12,430
I mean, I know you know it doesn't
have all the fucking hormones.

2763
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:14,640
I don't know if you can
necessarily offer it to the God.

2764
02:53:14,710 --> 02:53:17,030
Sorry, which God you're
offering it to. I mean,

2765
02:53:17,031 --> 02:53:22,031
I'm sure there's some native American
guy does a lot of the warrior bars

2766
02:53:24,840 --> 02:53:27,320
to
fear Hindu.

2767
02:53:27,321 --> 02:53:30,740
There's enough guys to
pick from and I got plenty.

2768
02:53:31,460 --> 02:53:34,220
Yeah, I think they'd be done
for the shroom tech as well,

2769
02:53:34,340 --> 02:53:38,120
which is stuff it's made from a mushroom,

2770
02:53:38,830 --> 02:53:40,410
the mushroom name,
different kinds of mushrooms

2771
02:53:41,790 --> 02:53:46,600
I was doing on
the board started to sound good,

2772
02:53:48,210 --> 02:53:52,090
but it's just to help you uptake oxygen
when you do with athletics. Yeah, yeah,

2773
02:53:52,270 --> 02:53:53,103
yeah.

2774
02:53:54,630 --> 02:53:58,140
You need to, especially as you get older,
your oxygen, it doesn't travel as well.

2775
02:53:58,690 --> 02:54:03,270
I just realized there's no greater joy
for echo. Then when someone's on the,

2776
02:54:03,360 --> 02:54:07,140
on the, on the podcast as a guest
that wants to know about this stuff,

2777
02:54:09,580 --> 02:54:14,580
like when I'm training or whatever oil
is it like you know your thing and I'm

2778
02:54:15,451 --> 02:54:19,500
like doing a sales pitch to
them. It seems like it. Anyway,

2779
02:54:19,640 --> 02:54:20,780
get them a krill shirt.

2780
02:54:22,120 --> 02:54:24,810
I asked me about the Krill oil.

2781
02:54:27,020 --> 02:54:29,520
I'm telling you in the mornings,
I told this story before,

2782
02:54:29,580 --> 02:54:32,660
Jack heard it plenty of times in
the mornings. My daughter, she's,

2783
02:54:32,730 --> 02:54:36,280
she's like for now, but you know when
she was three she come in, wake me up.

2784
02:54:36,290 --> 02:54:39,390
The only person in the world that hasn't
heard the story is Harley Fun. Yeah.

2785
02:54:40,550 --> 02:54:45,550
[inaudible] and me talk for
three hours right there.

2786
02:54:46,260 --> 02:54:50,410
Heck gets to talk for an hour now about
story.

2787
02:54:50,450 --> 02:54:51,750
And that was a good,

2788
02:54:54,280 --> 02:54:56,940
but she'd, she'd wake me up,
jump on my back. So you know,

2789
02:54:57,170 --> 02:54:59,660
now I've got to stand up out of bed,
cold,

2790
02:54:59,930 --> 02:55:04,640
sore from whatever with the three year
old on my back and it would be stiff.

2791
02:55:04,641 --> 02:55:08,180
I got to do the correct form to get up.
Otherwise, you know, you turn your back,

2792
02:55:08,181 --> 02:55:13,100
your knees, all that stuff after like
it was just under a week. Krill oil,

2793
02:55:13,940 --> 02:55:16,970
no factor. It's like I was
already warm. That's the feeling.

2794
02:55:18,650 --> 02:55:20,440
You want some Krill oil now.
I was just going to

2795
02:55:20,690 --> 02:55:25,100
Jack. I got to give my, uh, father-in-law
some props. May he rest in peace.

2796
02:55:25,101 --> 02:55:26,300
He turned me onto the Krill.

2797
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:30,390
Oh, all right. Let me
tell you other than laws,

2798
02:55:30,391 --> 02:55:32,430
but what's up filing laws?
They've been around,

2799
02:55:33,420 --> 02:55:36,290
been around a little longer than
us. Yeah. No, he turned me on and,

2800
02:55:36,291 --> 02:55:41,200
and even though you know, I am a
vegetarian, I do take the official,

2801
02:55:41,220 --> 02:55:44,310
the Krill oil and whatnot, because
you know what I mean? Look, I,

2802
02:55:45,030 --> 02:55:50,030
I started off as a vegetarian food for
whatever spiritual reasons and whatever

2803
02:55:51,361 --> 02:55:54,020
health reasons.
Now I,

2804
02:55:55,220 --> 02:55:59,670
I believe it's best to have
mainly vegetarian diet,

2805
02:56:00,420 --> 02:56:04,970
but if my body starts
saying, motherfucker, he
needed some fish like you,

2806
02:56:05,160 --> 02:56:09,000
you are like about to drop dead. If you
don't get some serious protein search,

2807
02:56:09,001 --> 02:56:12,030
like I will do what I,
what my body tells me to do.

2808
02:56:12,640 --> 02:56:17,640
I think humans are designed to be
able to do vegetarian and meat.

2809
02:56:17,760 --> 02:56:19,940
That's why we have two different
kinds of teeth. You know,

2810
02:56:20,490 --> 02:56:22,770
when we were hunter gatherers,

2811
02:56:22,771 --> 02:56:26,910
you know you were gathering a lot more
than you were hunting realistically.

2812
02:56:26,911 --> 02:56:31,030
Cause one thing wasn't always easy with
a fucking spear, you know, so yeah.

2813
02:56:31,580 --> 02:56:35,460
You know, I listen to my body a lot too
and my body usually tells me each day,

2814
02:56:38,480 --> 02:56:40,890
you know crops total pro.

2815
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:45,630
Well the good thing about the Krill,
whether this meat however much this means,

2816
02:56:45,810 --> 02:56:49,780
how they harvest the Krill is also yes.
Do it though.

2817
02:56:50,120 --> 02:56:53,190
It's good.
They use like ecofriendly chips.

2818
02:56:53,780 --> 02:56:58,780
He watched the video friendly
shifts [inaudible] no friendly shit.

2819
02:57:07,160 --> 02:57:11,940
Fuck it up the video.
I watched the video is good.

2820
02:57:12,120 --> 02:57:16,140
Okay. Maybe you just need to have their
own podcast called the echo on it.

2821
02:57:16,200 --> 02:57:20,550
Podcast. People need to know. You
got to fucking make your own line.

2822
02:57:20,551 --> 02:57:23,970
Eco Oil something. I don't
know man. It's hot it one.

2823
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:27,260
I think they haven't nailed it. All
right on it. I'm going to get on it.

2824
02:57:27,330 --> 02:57:30,060
Interesting enough how your
father in law turned up.

2825
02:57:30,061 --> 02:57:32,400
My father in law turned me onto it.
I didn't listen to him, by the way.

2826
02:57:32,430 --> 02:57:35,130
I only did it when Jocko was like, yeah,
I take Krill oil. So I was like, okay,

2827
02:57:35,131 --> 02:57:39,870
I'm going to take whatever. Anyway.

2828
02:57:40,350 --> 02:57:40,910
Anyway,

2829
02:57:40,910 --> 02:57:45,240
[inaudible] dot com slash Jocko that's
how you can get 10% off of all your stuff.

2830
02:57:45,241 --> 02:57:49,070
Whatever you like. Well, I'm just going
to ask him directly gave me the tech.

2831
02:57:51,470 --> 02:57:54,850
That's what I did in the
beginning to for sure. Yeah.

2832
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:59,850
Also good way to support Amazon.
Click through. So what all that is,

2833
02:57:59,851 --> 02:58:00,960
you shop on Amazon,
right?

2834
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:07,640
I guess I have how I just said you're the
only person that hadn't heard like the

2835
02:58:07,651 --> 02:58:08,030
Krill oil,

2836
02:58:08,030 --> 02:58:11,220
so now you're the only person in the
world does not getting everything they buy

2837
02:58:11,221 --> 02:58:14,500
off of Amazon. Oh, I live in
the city. I go to the store,

2838
02:58:15,420 --> 02:58:19,500
I guess isn't different. Yeah, we want it.
We go out and close the door and get it.

2839
02:58:19,501 --> 02:58:23,160
You can walk. Yeah, you can
walk everywhere. Yeah. It's
not like that. Like I said,

2840
02:58:23,220 --> 02:58:26,520
we got yards and barbecues and yards.

2841
02:58:27,800 --> 02:58:29,410
Fuck y'all motherfuckers all miserable.

2842
02:58:31,190 --> 02:58:35,490
No winter jazz. Mother fuckers. No snow,

2843
02:58:35,520 --> 02:58:39,480
nothing gets study. We have a winter.
Was He? You know he's from Hawaii.

2844
02:58:39,750 --> 02:58:44,130
He takes it from California.
Goes one step further.

2845
02:58:44,460 --> 02:58:45,630
My mom says that,
oh yeah,

2846
02:58:45,631 --> 02:58:48,920
in the winter it rains a lip or I don't
even know if that's true reins a little.

2847
02:58:48,930 --> 02:58:53,930
That shit that don't qualify as
[inaudible] mean it feeds the plants.

2848
02:58:57,110 --> 02:59:00,870
You know it's a fucking mind soon.
I don't want to hear it. Yeah man.

2849
02:59:00,930 --> 02:59:04,980
I hear bad things. Bad things. So Amazon,

2850
02:59:06,930 --> 02:59:11,550
Amazon, all these things you've turned to
me shopping on Amazon and this goes for

2851
02:59:11,551 --> 02:59:15,240
everyone. Before you get to animal,
you click through the website,

2852
02:59:15,800 --> 02:59:20,040
our website, your website support.

2853
02:59:20,041 --> 02:59:23,250
So when you bought you get a thing from
Amazon saying hey, thanks for referring.

2854
02:59:23,790 --> 02:59:25,230
You know it's pretty,
that's pretty dope.

2855
02:59:25,231 --> 02:59:28,650
They give us a little bit a little piece
of that and you know what it costs the

2856
02:59:28,651 --> 02:59:32,820
Vick. The cool thing is, cause you can
set up things for, for like podcasts,

2857
02:59:32,970 --> 02:59:36,600
that's basically give me money,
give me money.

2858
02:59:36,660 --> 02:59:41,160
But I don't really like asking people
for money. This is, you don't even,

2859
02:59:41,430 --> 02:59:45,030
it doesn't, your price doesn't
go up. It's actually in my book,

2860
02:59:45,060 --> 02:59:47,850
it's kind of a good way to stick it to
the man because Amazon's got a kick a

2861
02:59:47,851 --> 02:59:49,680
little bit down to the
podcast are over here.

2862
02:59:50,310 --> 02:59:55,310
It's kind of not because I mean you
stick it to the man to [inaudible] fucked

2863
03:00:09,190 --> 03:00:10,023
man.

2864
03:00:14,990 --> 03:00:19,680
Yeah, a little bit of confusion there.
That's cool. But I mean either way,

2865
03:00:19,681 --> 03:00:23,460
you know when you do the, I think it does
benefit Amazon cause like a referral,

2866
03:00:23,580 --> 03:00:24,413
you know,
I mean,

2867
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:29,400
so you're saying that somebody might
order something from another online

2868
03:00:29,401 --> 03:00:33,460
retailer but instead someone says I'm
going to support the podcast. Yeah,

2869
03:00:33,510 --> 03:00:37,380
fuck that. Support the podcast.
Motherfucker. Don't be a bunch of bitches.

2870
03:00:37,381 --> 03:00:41,070
You gotta support the home team,
man. Fuck that. I feel the same

2871
03:00:42,980 --> 03:00:45,120
shit. But Amazon is actually
pretty cool like that.

2872
03:00:45,121 --> 03:00:47,190
Like they'll offer every once in
a while like little things like,

2873
03:00:47,191 --> 03:00:49,530
oh you want to donate?
Like you round up. Like,

2874
03:00:49,531 --> 03:00:53,880
let's say your thing costed like eight
89 and you're like, Hey, your gut,

2875
03:00:53,910 --> 03:00:57,990
11 cents to the next dollar, you want to
donate that 11 cents to like something,

2876
03:00:58,040 --> 03:01:01,840
it's like charity anyway. It's good like
that. Anyway, and I support the podcast,

2877
03:01:01,880 --> 03:01:04,510
do through the Amazon, click through,
go to the Jocko podcast website,

2878
03:01:04,511 --> 03:01:09,050
which is Jocko podcast.com and click
on the support or the Amazon banner and

2879
03:01:09,051 --> 03:01:11,470
then do your shopping. And
that's a good way. Some people,

2880
03:01:13,210 --> 03:01:15,100
they'll do it and then like the little,

2881
03:01:15,460 --> 03:01:19,660
they'll get a screenshot of it and they'll
send it to me on Twitter knowing that

2882
03:01:19,810 --> 03:01:24,410
that is cool. That is dope. It's
confirmation. Yeah. And it's Kinda like,

2883
03:01:24,570 --> 03:01:26,560
like they say, Hey, I'm
supporting them and I feel,

2884
03:01:26,561 --> 03:01:30,940
I feel that like literal direct
support from their coach Charles A.

2885
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:35,020
Good day as your support, the podcast
with a little social needs when,

2886
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:38,980
cause I got, a lot of times they don't, I
don't see like the price or nothing. You,

2887
03:01:39,220 --> 03:01:41,740
they'll just say, oh, it'll be
a screenshot. Pretty ambiguous.

2888
03:01:41,800 --> 03:01:46,080
It could very well not even be them.
So putting the podcast necessarily call.

2889
03:01:46,100 --> 03:01:49,860
Yeah. Just trying to tickle your did
that. Maybe it works. It works out.

2890
03:01:49,861 --> 03:01:54,480
Like when they do that makes me feel good.
I feel like they care very easy.

2891
03:01:54,760 --> 03:01:57,040
Easy. Anyway. You can
subscribe to the podcast,

2892
03:01:57,041 --> 03:02:01,810
iTunes if you listen to it on iTunes,
stitcher, Google, play, all these ones.

2893
03:02:02,410 --> 03:02:04,960
Um, yeah, that helps leave a
review. If you're in the mood,

2894
03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:06,310
like what chuck was saying,

2895
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:11,500
or hardly seems like you don't give
a review on this specific one. Oh,

2896
03:02:11,560 --> 03:02:15,460
we have a youtube channel. If you
have not subscribed to that, good.

2897
03:02:15,490 --> 03:02:17,290
Subscribe to that.
If,

2898
03:02:18,420 --> 03:02:22,600
if you'd like the video version of this
podcast, but the excerpts, you know,

2899
03:02:22,601 --> 03:02:26,200
people have been kind of giving me
crap about saint excerpts a lot too.

2900
03:02:26,201 --> 03:02:27,430
I say excerpts.

2901
03:02:27,610 --> 03:02:32,380
You say it a lot and you
put your tone on it for you.

2902
03:02:32,381 --> 03:02:35,170
Don't just say, I don't think he said
no. You don't say, Hey, you know,

2903
03:02:35,171 --> 03:02:38,740
we've got some excerpts that we put
on it. You Go, I made a couple extra.

2904
03:02:41,290 --> 03:02:45,460
You Go, you go. Escalation
voice level 12. Yes.

2905
03:02:46,210 --> 03:02:50,560
Well I think that was your right? Was that
your idea? Excerpts? Yeah. There you go.

2906
03:02:50,620 --> 03:02:54,490
Yeah, because people don't want to
watch TV. They're not going to watch it.

2907
03:02:54,491 --> 03:02:59,210
Three hours, three hour podcast. If
there's some point, oh hey Joe glue.

2908
03:02:59,211 --> 03:03:01,570
Cool thing with Harley Flanagan.
He was talking about this.

2909
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:03,730
They want to see Harley for three minutes.

2910
03:03:03,731 --> 03:03:06,130
I want to send it to their body
that they listen to hardcore with.

2911
03:03:06,670 --> 03:03:10,930
They can't send them, hey, watch this
three and a half hour podcast in the next,

2912
03:03:10,960 --> 03:03:14,570
during your lunch break, you're going
to send him a little clip, right?

2913
03:03:15,070 --> 03:03:19,720
Listen to Harley Flanagan. Talk about a
street fight. Yeah, yeah, exactly right.

2914
03:03:19,750 --> 03:03:22,690
Maybe you should do a bunch of excerpts
of yourself talking about on it and

2915
03:03:22,691 --> 03:03:27,520
extra next to me. Seen excerpts.
Yeah, that's not very shareable,

2916
03:03:27,610 --> 03:03:29,800
but that was a good idea.
Thank you Jacqueline for that.

2917
03:03:29,801 --> 03:03:33,910
So if you want to see excerpts of random
lessons, not random, they're not random.

2918
03:03:33,911 --> 03:03:38,530
Sorry, any mean random excerpts of
lessons, individual lessons selected,

2919
03:03:38,590 --> 03:03:42,580
selected from the podcast. Boom. That's
on youtube. And also if you want one,

2920
03:03:43,570 --> 03:03:45,520
tell echo on social media.
Hey,

2921
03:03:45,521 --> 03:03:50,380
make this time period on this podcast
into an excerpt and put me on there too,

2922
03:03:50,381 --> 03:03:54,790
because that way I can harass him too. Now
we can't do to every single one. Quest.

2923
03:03:54,820 --> 03:03:57,040
Yes.
Straight to every single one.

2924
03:03:57,410 --> 03:04:01,730
But some of them icy and I
go, yeah, Echo. Come on man.

2925
03:04:02,140 --> 03:04:05,580
The nickel are asking. I agree. Could
you post the wheat grass and heroin?

2926
03:04:07,550 --> 03:04:11,450
That'd be a fun one. I think we're gonna.
I think we're going to do that one.

2927
03:04:13,190 --> 03:04:14,023
But

2928
03:04:19,270 --> 03:04:20,390
we'll have tee shirt

2929
03:04:20,530 --> 03:04:22,530
[inaudible]

2930
03:04:23,280 --> 03:04:25,050
cause everybody, that's another
thing, they want extroverts,

2931
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:27,600
but people also want to have
tee shirts for everything.

2932
03:04:28,480 --> 03:04:33,480
Like anything that some person where
somebody finds something funny or

2933
03:04:33,541 --> 03:04:36,390
interesting or whatever and it's, hey,
we need to make that into a teacher.

2934
03:04:36,660 --> 03:04:40,500
And then it gets escalated to a certain
point where enough people ask for it and

2935
03:04:40,501 --> 03:04:44,110
then we break down. You should go
breaks down and makes a teacher.

2936
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:49,110
It works too. It's like a
Oh yeah, it's good. Yeah.

2937
03:04:49,230 --> 03:04:52,950
It's so the excerpts. Good
idea. Thank you. Uh, Youtube.

2938
03:04:53,790 --> 03:04:56,760
But if you do the request,
if you're requesting that the,

2939
03:04:56,761 --> 03:05:00,390
you know what episode and what
x or be sure you know which,

2940
03:05:01,200 --> 03:05:03,660
which excerpts are already on there.
Cause sometimes people are like, Hey,

2941
03:05:03,661 --> 03:05:08,430
do this London and then it'll already
be on there just saying. Yeah.

2942
03:05:08,440 --> 03:05:12,460
Sometimes people tell me to
do a book review and it's
already been done. Oh yeah.

2943
03:05:12,540 --> 03:05:16,830
If you're doing a review on art of war,
yeah, I get a lot of requests like that.

2944
03:05:17,580 --> 03:05:20,190
Then I have to look up and see which one
it is and then send it back to him and

2945
03:05:20,191 --> 03:05:21,960
say, hey man, I already
did it on this one. Yeah.

2946
03:05:22,170 --> 03:05:24,090
Actually that's a good like
how we're going over today.

2947
03:05:24,091 --> 03:05:28,170
That's a good thing about how we put the,
the timestamps on all the subjects.

2948
03:05:28,171 --> 03:05:31,170
So an and that feeds into the search
term. So if you, you're like, hey,

2949
03:05:31,171 --> 03:05:36,171
some suit Jocko podcasts are devor it'll
go boom to that episode 23 actually

2950
03:05:38,221 --> 03:05:39,330
coming on top of this book,

2951
03:05:39,480 --> 03:05:41,940
there's a book out about HR
right now from the bad brains.

2952
03:05:42,270 --> 03:05:47,070
And the reason I'm thinking of this is
because one of my buddies who's in to the

2953
03:05:47,071 --> 03:05:50,370
podcast who was a hardcore kid growing up,

2954
03:05:50,730 --> 03:05:54,480
and his name is Nahko,
but he's a,

2955
03:05:54,540 --> 03:05:57,060
he's a cop in La and he
was a cop in New York.

2956
03:05:57,450 --> 03:06:00,750
And so it's,
I'm just thinking about that.

2957
03:06:00,930 --> 03:06:04,260
Here's a kid that grew up listening to
the cro mags, who's been like saying,

2958
03:06:04,261 --> 03:06:06,180
get hardly or you got to get her,
he's a cop.

2959
03:06:06,210 --> 03:06:10,290
He's a bad ass cop and his and his girl
was a cop too. Dang. They're getting,

2960
03:06:10,291 --> 03:06:13,350
after I got to phrase that
cops, man, don't hate them all.

2961
03:06:16,160 --> 03:06:18,420
You know people, they'll be
like, hey, no, I don't eat carbs.

2962
03:06:18,570 --> 03:06:19,710
I have friends that are cops.

2963
03:06:22,880 --> 03:06:27,820
Some of my best friends are black.
I got a cough Capo,

2964
03:06:27,821 --> 03:06:28,654
my phone.

2965
03:06:37,290 --> 03:06:41,510
Fuck No. Oh good. I'm also, hey,

2966
03:06:41,750 --> 03:06:45,310
Jocko has a store. It's called Jocko
store. These shirts, stucco. We're man,

2967
03:06:45,810 --> 03:06:48,770
I need to get one of these discipline
equals freedom. The fucking shirts.

2968
03:06:48,771 --> 03:06:53,060
You know, I wrote a song recently
that I named discipline equals freedom

2969
03:06:54,950 --> 03:06:56,060
and just I got

2970
03:06:56,060 --> 03:06:58,950
to fucking say,
because you know I don't give a fuck,

2971
03:06:58,951 --> 03:07:01,650
I'm going to say it and that's that.
Yo,

2972
03:07:02,730 --> 03:07:06,900
when I found out that Jocko was in the
hardcore and when I found out that he was

2973
03:07:06,901 --> 03:07:09,420
into my band, the Cro Mags, I was,

2974
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:13,680
I was very proud and all and uh,

2975
03:07:15,240 --> 03:07:17,660
and I asked this motherfucker, you give
a thought about singing in her heart

2976
03:07:19,500 --> 03:07:22,760
and fucking reaction I
got out of this month

2977
03:07:22,840 --> 03:07:23,140
fucker.

2978
03:07:23,140 --> 03:07:27,570
If my computer screen could like just
turn into like a fucking screaming look.

2979
03:07:28,730 --> 03:07:33,310
Motherfucking the, the,
the the response. Anyway,

2980
03:07:34,380 --> 03:07:38,350
I am very proud to say that a w w we are
going to be playing besides doing this

2981
03:07:38,351 --> 03:07:43,330
European tour. I'm going away in
a week playing all over the place.

2982
03:07:43,331 --> 03:07:47,290
Then we'll come back and in June I'm
going to be playing in La and we have

2983
03:07:47,291 --> 03:07:52,291
invited Jocko to come and make a special
guest appearance when we play it,

2984
03:07:52,331 --> 03:07:53,920
the fury fest in La.

2985
03:07:53,921 --> 03:07:58,921
And so for all you motherfuckers out
there who want to see me playing with one

2986
03:07:59,411 --> 03:08:04,411
of the baddest motherfuckers walking
this fucking earth certified by the u s

2987
03:08:04,871 --> 03:08:07,890
fucking government,
then you,

2988
03:08:08,260 --> 03:08:12,460
you were going to see some fucking Badass
shit because I'll tell you I have not

2989
03:08:12,461 --> 03:08:16,690
gotten, I haven't been able to just play
the bass and not be like chained to the

2990
03:08:16,691 --> 03:08:18,370
microphone in a really long time.

2991
03:08:18,371 --> 03:08:21,850
And that was one of the things that was
intense about the cro mags back in the

2992
03:08:21,850 --> 03:08:25,060
old days was that me and the singer
both used to go fucking ape shit when we

2993
03:08:25,061 --> 03:08:29,920
played. And it's funny cause you know I
was thinking for the longest time man,

2994
03:08:29,921 --> 03:08:34,720
if I could get a singer what I get and I'm
like, you know shit, I'm like, I'm like,

2995
03:08:34,800 --> 03:08:37,660
you know Henry Rollins in his
prime was fucking bad ass.

2996
03:08:37,661 --> 03:08:40,580
You know Phil Anselmo in his
prime was a fucking bad ass

2997
03:08:42,390 --> 03:08:43,223
jock.

2998
03:08:45,000 --> 03:08:50,000
So we'll see what happens if
[inaudible] want to see some shit.

2999
03:08:51,470 --> 03:08:55,100
You know, I used to have a fake seal
thing in my band. Now I get a real one.

3000
03:08:56,920 --> 03:08:59,190
We'll see what happens if a,
if a Mike ends up in my hands,

3001
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,640
I may have to slap them with
a mic and see what happens.

3002
03:09:02,740 --> 03:09:07,270
Hey, there you go. Yeah, you guys
can sing the or with those shirts on

3003
03:09:10,810 --> 03:09:13,770
[inaudible] story. That's where you get
them. I got you. Whatever shirt you need.

3004
03:09:13,980 --> 03:09:18,100
Oh yeah, for sure. But if you're
in the mood to support the podcast,

3005
03:09:18,101 --> 03:09:22,430
purchase a shirt or whatever,
we have other stuff on
there. Jocko. Story, outcome.

3006
03:09:22,840 --> 03:09:25,720
Got Those mugs you made. Yeah,
those are some good monks.

3007
03:09:25,810 --> 03:09:27,820
So I shouldn't have even said this.

3008
03:09:27,821 --> 03:09:31,590
He's been amped about these brew coffee
mugs we got or what did he called?

3009
03:09:31,591 --> 03:09:35,880
Travel mugs. Travel mugs. Tumblers.
I've heard. Yeah. All right. Look,

3010
03:09:35,890 --> 03:09:39,850
I won't go that deep into it this time.
Next time I'm going deep extra deep.

3011
03:09:40,060 --> 03:09:44,210
This time I'll go. Just kind of deep.
This is straight up the best cup of it,

3012
03:09:44,211 --> 03:09:45,790
right? What does it look?
It look like his head,

3013
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:47,000
like a handle on it.

3014
03:09:52,350 --> 03:09:53,470
Actually we kept a little bit,

3015
03:09:54,070 --> 03:09:58,000
you know, it's just black on black. It's
like black matte and then the design,

3016
03:09:58,020 --> 03:10:01,930
you know, it looks like this on one
side, then it's shiny black anyway,

3017
03:10:01,931 --> 03:10:02,764
it looks super dope,

3018
03:10:03,370 --> 03:10:08,370
but 30 ounces so big enough but small
enough to fit in your cup holder.

3019
03:10:08,770 --> 03:10:11,200
Boom. I, I'd been drinking
some mother fucking coffee. So,

3020
03:10:12,340 --> 03:10:15,940
so here's the thing about the coffee,
it's,

3021
03:10:16,060 --> 03:10:19,150
it's those ones that are like, I
dunno how they make them, you know,

3022
03:10:19,151 --> 03:10:23,200
the insight and the, I dunno,
they're stainless steel, BPA
free, all this, you know,

3023
03:10:23,380 --> 03:10:27,250
good stuff. I don't know what all of
that means, but it's, I know it's dope.

3024
03:10:27,490 --> 03:10:30,940
It's Krill involved. Yeah,
it's somewhere down. The line

3025
03:10:32,530 --> 03:10:37,300
is involved, but it keeps it like
your car. If you like your coffee hot,

3026
03:10:37,330 --> 03:10:40,030
it'll keep it hot for like eight
hours or something like that.

3027
03:10:40,060 --> 03:10:43,510
I don't know if it keeps it the same
temperature for eight hours. It might,

3028
03:10:43,540 --> 03:10:46,920
I don't know. I've never had hot,
I'm a cold coffee guy. All right,

3029
03:10:46,930 --> 03:10:50,710
well here's the good news about that
Bro. But you put quit. How's this?

3030
03:10:50,740 --> 03:10:54,580
I put ice water in it and
I was drinking it a drink.

3031
03:10:56,340 --> 03:10:57,370
Like almost all of it.

3032
03:10:57,371 --> 03:10:59,920
There was still a little bit in
the bottom and I forgot about it.

3033
03:10:59,921 --> 03:11:02,350
Went to sleep the next day I
was cleaning up. I was like,

3034
03:11:02,351 --> 03:11:05,140
oh my cup from last night.
Boom, ice still in there.

3035
03:11:05,530 --> 03:11:07,600
You know how usually in a
regular cup it's like water.

3036
03:11:08,320 --> 03:11:12,670
It'll keep it cold for 24 hours.
Boom. Not losing any coldness.

3037
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Anyway, I want to go way deeper next
time, but this is straight, you know,

3038
03:11:17,020 --> 03:11:21,030
special podcast for you to talk about
that. That Cup or bowl out group covered.

3039
03:11:21,340 --> 03:11:25,390
One episode will be the cop.
The other episode will be the oil oil.

3040
03:11:25,390 --> 03:11:28,440
Every single day.
I'll go deeper with the oil bro.

3041
03:11:28,450 --> 03:11:32,820
I'll go deeper with the Krill oil
right now if we have, I know it all,

3042
03:11:32,830 --> 03:11:33,663
but anyway,

3043
03:11:37,210 --> 03:11:40,200
essentially what it is anyway, but
yeah, but yeah, chocolate star,

3044
03:11:40,201 --> 03:11:43,120
this some cool stuff on their
travel mugs are out. Those are good.

3045
03:11:44,100 --> 03:11:46,870
There's some bumper stickers, some
women's stuff on there, some patches,

3046
03:11:47,830 --> 03:11:51,820
some rash guards, one new rash guard, and
it's not, it'll be out, but nonetheless,

3047
03:11:51,821 --> 03:11:54,550
I'm not going to promise anything quite
yet, but new rash guards going to be out.

3048
03:11:54,551 --> 03:11:57,110
Hoodies are on there.
There's some good stuff. Hey,

3049
03:11:57,111 --> 03:12:00,970
just take a look if you like what's on
there. You want to support in that way.

3050
03:12:01,680 --> 03:12:05,070
Get something also psychological warfare.
Okay.

3051
03:12:05,830 --> 03:12:09,250
All right. Hardly might not know about
psychological war for so many. Explain it.

3052
03:12:09,400 --> 03:12:13,210
Go deep. None. Not that deep.
So basically it's an album.

3053
03:12:13,270 --> 03:12:17,180
We're three hours and 18 minutes
into this quick. All right.

3054
03:12:17,560 --> 03:12:20,720
It's an album echo.
Don't care. Don't care.

3055
03:12:20,830 --> 03:12:22,940
Don't care if the hours
and keep listening. No,

3056
03:12:22,941 --> 03:12:25,660
I'm just saying this part is kind of
important too. You know what I mean?

3057
03:12:26,650 --> 03:12:30,520
People are out there getting after
it, waking up early. Some people,

3058
03:12:30,640 --> 03:12:34,570
some of us sticking to the program,
sticking to the Diet,

3059
03:12:34,571 --> 03:12:36,670
sticking to the workouts,
right?

3060
03:12:37,060 --> 03:12:39,940
Every once in a while you wake up or
you don't feel like waking up early that

3061
03:12:39,941 --> 03:12:43,090
day or you don't feel like working
out that day, you're kind of tired.

3062
03:12:43,120 --> 03:12:47,950
You had a hard day, whatever. So when
it's time to it, when it's go time,

3063
03:12:47,951 --> 03:12:50,920
you're like, Hey, maybe I'll skip today.
You know when you sleeping on the program,

3064
03:12:51,010 --> 03:12:52,070
I know that feeling

3065
03:12:54,730 --> 03:12:59,300
where you skip your wheat grass.
Exactly right.

3066
03:12:59,301 --> 03:13:04,060
So Bam, get this album called
psychological warfare to Jocko. It's not,

3067
03:13:04,130 --> 03:13:04,963
it's not music.

3068
03:13:05,300 --> 03:13:10,300
It's just tracks with Jocko telling you
how to overcome those weak moments in

3069
03:13:10,761 --> 03:13:15,290
your program. Oh boy. But it's him telling
when I, when I am having a weak moment,

3070
03:13:15,291 --> 03:13:20,260
the last thing I want to fucking hear,
telling me to get after it

3071
03:13:22,620 --> 03:13:26,630
right now I got to do that.
Fuck, it's four o'clock.

3072
03:13:28,080 --> 03:13:33,010
Can we fuck another four
hours? Fuck me. You know,

3073
03:13:33,050 --> 03:13:36,080
I like sleep. I don't know what the fuck
is wrong with you guys, but whatever.

3074
03:13:36,140 --> 03:13:40,850
It's all good. Yeah. Hey
Man, I'm sure I like dreams.

3075
03:13:41,080 --> 03:13:44,750
No, actually I don't. Sleep is the enemy.

3076
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:49,340
It's like a,
it's like the last hallucinogenic.

3077
03:13:49,341 --> 03:13:54,341
I can take [inaudible] dream.

3078
03:13:55,221 --> 03:13:59,190
My brain goes bananas.
Love it.

3079
03:14:04,910 --> 03:14:08,870
Okay, I get it. But it goes for
the workup stuff too though.

3080
03:14:08,871 --> 03:14:12,140
Not just asleep so you can skip the
sleep ones. So you go, but like,

3081
03:14:12,440 --> 03:14:15,590
like the workout went until tell you
don't skip the word anyway. It's a good,

3082
03:14:15,810 --> 03:14:18,560
very helpful,
a hundred percent chance of success.

3083
03:14:18,650 --> 03:14:23,220
But Dolan, good psychological
warfare. And uh,

3084
03:14:23,720 --> 03:14:26,890
also by the way,
when you click through Amazon,

3085
03:14:27,160 --> 03:14:29,080
you can click through and you
can buy this book right here.

3086
03:14:29,320 --> 03:14:32,620
The book is called
hardcore life of my own.

3087
03:14:32,980 --> 03:14:37,630
It is written by Harley Flanagan
and we'll have it up on the website.

3088
03:14:37,920 --> 03:14:42,670
But let me rephrase that. It's on the
website or are we waiting to be purchased?

3089
03:14:43,150 --> 03:14:47,980
And there you go pick it up on Amazon.

3090
03:14:47,981 --> 03:14:49,960
You can also get some Jocko white tea.

3091
03:14:50,570 --> 03:14:55,570
I hear now there's some things in the
book that Harley does not recommend.

3092
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:58,090
He, he, he's tried them,

3093
03:14:58,091 --> 03:15:01,150
but he does not recommend some of those
things that he clearly states in the

3094
03:15:01,151 --> 03:15:05,020
book. He literally says,
I do not recommend. For
instance, I do not recommend

3095
03:15:06,580 --> 03:15:10,690
angel dust. I do not
recommend heroin. I do not.

3096
03:15:10,691 --> 03:15:12,100
So there's a lot of things
he doesn't recommend.

3097
03:15:12,130 --> 03:15:16,150
Now here's something that I will
strongly recommend as Jocko white tea.

3098
03:15:16,720 --> 03:15:21,520
It's gonna get you a lot
better results than anything.

3099
03:15:21,940 --> 03:15:25,540
Any of the supplements that that
Harley's taken in this book.

3100
03:15:26,080 --> 03:15:29,830
You go with Jocko white tea instead,
you're going to have a much better trip.

3101
03:15:30,580 --> 03:15:33,790
I'm going to tell you that right now.
Also,

3102
03:15:34,060 --> 03:15:37,670
we talked a lot about Jujitsu today and
we talk about Jujitsu a lot. You know,

3103
03:15:37,780 --> 03:15:39,520
Jujitsu is a big,
you know,

3104
03:15:39,580 --> 03:15:44,580
Jujitsu is a powerful thing and there's
a book that's out right now and it's

3105
03:15:45,130 --> 03:15:49,350
geared, it's written kind of written for
kids. It's called way of the warrior kid.

3106
03:15:49,680 --> 03:15:52,650
It's available. Everyone that's
bought it already. Thank you.

3107
03:15:53,500 --> 03:15:56,400
I appreciate the support.
Thanks for spreading the word.

3108
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:59,580
Thanks for letting kids get
a little insight into life.

3109
03:16:00,150 --> 03:16:02,010
And I'll tell you,

3110
03:16:02,011 --> 03:16:06,810
there's something about this book that is,
when I wrote it,

3111
03:16:08,740 --> 03:16:13,500
the the debt, the father, the book
is about a kid who's, you know,

3112
03:16:13,501 --> 03:16:15,240
fifth grade going through life.

3113
03:16:15,990 --> 03:16:19,950
The father in the book
doesn't have a role.

3114
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:24,600
Now you might think I'm a bad person
for not giving the father the role,

3115
03:16:25,260 --> 03:16:27,000
but you know,
they all,

3116
03:16:27,001 --> 03:16:30,060
he says that there's one line about
the father and the book, He says,

3117
03:16:30,570 --> 03:16:35,460
my dad's gone a lot with work and stuff.
It's that ambiguous.

3118
03:16:36,120 --> 03:16:39,300
And, and there's a couple
reasons why I did that.

3119
03:16:39,301 --> 03:16:43,350
And the number one reason is because not
everyone, not every kid has got a dad.

3120
03:16:43,380 --> 03:16:46,580
I mean, what you're saying is
actually very real. Yeah. You know,

3121
03:16:46,650 --> 03:16:50,190
and a lot of kids have to
just deal with, uh, yeah,

3122
03:16:50,280 --> 03:16:53,570
my father is not around
much. Yeah. You know, and,

3123
03:16:53,571 --> 03:16:55,500
and that's why I did it.
And,

3124
03:16:55,570 --> 03:16:59,160
and there's another subtle
reason and you know,

3125
03:16:59,220 --> 03:17:02,940
without going into too much crazy detail,
the lead character in the book,

3126
03:17:02,941 --> 03:17:07,380
his name is mark,
and he's actually named after Mark Lee,

3127
03:17:07,381 --> 03:17:10,320
who was one of my guys,
were just an incredible,

3128
03:17:11,340 --> 03:17:14,310
incredible person,
incredible warrior.

3129
03:17:14,430 --> 03:17:19,110
And he was killed in Iraq and you know,
he was,

3130
03:17:19,490 --> 03:17:23,520
he, he didn't have a dad. His
mom raised him and you know,

3131
03:17:23,521 --> 03:17:27,930
so it was my way of saying, look,
you know, not everyone has a dad.

3132
03:17:28,710 --> 03:17:32,790
And, and in the book, he's got a strong
uncle that comes in and helps him.

3133
03:17:32,791 --> 03:17:35,790
But at the end of the book is uncle
points out to them and he says,

3134
03:17:35,820 --> 03:17:38,550
who's going to help me now? And
his uncle says to him, look,

3135
03:17:39,150 --> 03:17:43,080
you don't need to,
you know what the right things to do are.

3136
03:17:43,081 --> 03:17:44,460
You know how to stay on the right path.

3137
03:17:44,461 --> 03:17:46,620
You don't need someone to
hold your hand all the time.

3138
03:17:46,800 --> 03:17:50,940
You can make this happen for yourself.
And that's the message, you know,

3139
03:17:50,970 --> 03:17:53,280
that I'm trying to get across to
kids that might not have a dad.

3140
03:17:53,281 --> 03:17:55,440
They might not have an uncle,
they might not have a mom.

3141
03:17:56,190 --> 03:17:58,770
But you can find out what the
right path is. You can get on it,

3142
03:17:58,771 --> 03:18:02,240
you can stay on it. And that's, that's
why I wrote the book that way. And,

3143
03:18:02,250 --> 03:18:03,030
and you know,
it's,

3144
03:18:03,030 --> 03:18:06,120
it's interesting cause I've gotten asked
many times over the years, you know,

3145
03:18:06,360 --> 03:18:08,420
about what do you think
about fatherhood and,

3146
03:18:08,490 --> 03:18:12,000
and the important roles that fathers
play. And again, you know, I go back to,

3147
03:18:12,060 --> 03:18:12,511
for instance,

3148
03:18:12,511 --> 03:18:16,460
Mark Lee's a great example of a kid that
was raised and have a dad and his mom's

3149
03:18:16,770 --> 03:18:20,940
a strong woman in a and an incredible
person and she raised a warrior.

3150
03:18:21,450 --> 03:18:24,810
So that's why I did that in that book.
And you know,

3151
03:18:24,811 --> 03:18:26,190
another thing that I did in that book is,
you know,

3152
03:18:26,191 --> 03:18:29,100
Jujitsu plays a prominent role,
but you could replace that with wrestling,

3153
03:18:29,101 --> 03:18:31,410
with boxing, with, with Moitai.

3154
03:18:31,500 --> 03:18:35,910
But jujitsu was really a big part of it.
But so is studying,

3155
03:18:36,210 --> 03:18:40,220
you know, um, learning, learning
how to learn and having, and,

3156
03:18:40,221 --> 03:18:41,370
and as a kid,

3157
03:18:41,371 --> 03:18:45,150
seeing what the opportunity is in
being educated because a lot of kids,

3158
03:18:45,151 --> 03:18:46,690
myself included,
when you're going to school,

3159
03:18:46,691 --> 03:18:51,280
when you're 10 years old or 15 years
old, you don't care. You just don't care.

3160
03:18:51,670 --> 03:18:53,830
And it's,
I want,

3161
03:18:53,860 --> 03:18:58,480
I want kids to realize that it's
beneficial to get stronger, faster,

3162
03:18:58,510 --> 03:19:01,330
smarter and better.
So that's a way of the war.

3163
03:19:01,331 --> 03:19:05,830
Your kid get it and get it for your
local library too because they need it.

3164
03:19:05,860 --> 03:19:10,600
Cause there's some kid that will grab
that book in the library and it'll get

3165
03:19:10,601 --> 03:19:15,490
them on the right path. Also,
discipline equals freedom field manual.

3166
03:19:15,520 --> 03:19:20,520
You can find it by itself in the get
after its section of any bookstore or

3167
03:19:22,841 --> 03:19:26,050
online book retailer.
If you look in the get after at section,

3168
03:19:26,080 --> 03:19:27,940
this is a big empty shelf.
There's a one book there,

3169
03:19:28,630 --> 03:19:30,550
it's called discipline
equals freedom field manual.

3170
03:19:30,640 --> 03:19:33,460
We had start petitioning now
to make that happen at Amazon.

3171
03:19:33,461 --> 03:19:37,630
They just need like when you drop down
business lifestyle, health and fitness,

3172
03:19:37,660 --> 03:19:38,920
get out,
boom.

3173
03:19:38,950 --> 03:19:43,900
There's that one book they'd
better get in the game and

3174
03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:47,120
also there's extreme ownership.

3175
03:19:48,020 --> 03:19:51,680
The book that kind of started all of this
stuff by the way. Thanks. Appreciate it.

3176
03:19:52,250 --> 03:19:57,200
It's about leadership and it's about
combat and it's about taking fucking

3177
03:19:57,201 --> 03:20:00,090
responsibility and it's about
taking responsibility. Absolutely.

3178
03:20:00,110 --> 03:20:02,480
That's fucking huge. Yeah, that's huge.

3179
03:20:02,830 --> 03:20:07,520
That's something that I think is one of
the hardest things for most people to

3180
03:20:07,521 --> 03:20:09,500
do.
And you know,

3181
03:20:09,501 --> 03:20:13,520
I actually highlighted that a bunch of
times in your book where you're kind of

3182
03:20:13,521 --> 03:20:18,521
explaining things that I guess you
would say maybe resulted in something

3183
03:20:18,861 --> 03:20:20,900
happening bad in your life and you'd say,
Hey,

3184
03:20:20,901 --> 03:20:22,640
this happened and this
happened and this happened.

3185
03:20:22,820 --> 03:20:25,940
And every time you went laid that out,
at the end of it you'd say,

3186
03:20:26,360 --> 03:20:30,350
but it's my fault and I should have
done, I, I made this happen to myself.

3187
03:20:30,351 --> 03:20:32,290
So it's pretty, uh, and,

3188
03:20:32,300 --> 03:20:35,130
and you wrote this book before we
probably writing this to say, you know,

3189
03:20:35,131 --> 03:20:35,811
you were writing this book,

3190
03:20:35,811 --> 03:20:39,380
the same tower is right in that book when
I was basically fucking trying to kill

3191
03:20:39,381 --> 03:20:42,590
myself with drugs and everything
else is when I started it.

3192
03:20:42,770 --> 03:20:47,720
And even in that state, you always
say, you know, it's my fault.

3193
03:20:47,780 --> 03:20:50,240
I should've, you know, hey
my, my dad wasn't around.

3194
03:20:50,250 --> 03:20:53,840
Make a habit out of looking for
other people to blame. I mean, it's,

3195
03:20:53,841 --> 03:20:58,841
it's important to identify the
roots of the problem and so on.

3196
03:21:01,011 --> 03:21:05,210
And what made you the way you
are so you can fix them. Exactly.

3197
03:21:06,790 --> 03:21:08,360
Exactly.
And a big,

3198
03:21:08,570 --> 03:21:13,490
a big part of being a man is accepting
responsibility for your fuck ups.

3199
03:21:14,480 --> 03:21:17,850
And I thought that was awesome.
You know, and again, you know, um,

3200
03:21:17,930 --> 03:21:22,670
when you were talking about what you
learned from your dad not being around and

3201
03:21:22,671 --> 03:21:26,090
then how you apply that to help other
kids that are in that situation,

3202
03:21:26,091 --> 03:21:28,700
teaching them to Jitsu and taking care
of him and be building relationships the

3203
03:21:28,701 --> 03:21:31,650
best you can with your kids and with
other kids that are around. Man, that's,

3204
03:21:32,240 --> 03:21:33,530
that's exactly what you're talking about.

3205
03:21:36,260 --> 03:21:41,130
So that's extreme ownership
and also don't hoard the knowledge.

3206
03:21:41,220 --> 03:21:44,580
You might think, hey, I'm going to
get extreme ownership for myself.

3207
03:21:44,581 --> 03:21:47,090
I'm going to read at night and then I'm
going to become a good leader and I'm

3208
03:21:47,091 --> 03:21:49,670
going to do better at work. Don't
do that. That's the wrong move.

3209
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:53,420
What you want to do. You want to actually
distribute it to your team. Yeah.

3210
03:21:53,480 --> 03:21:56,210
And that way they all get on board and
now the whole team starts kicking ass.

3211
03:21:56,300 --> 03:21:59,870
That's what you want to do.
Up and down the chain of command.

3212
03:22:00,170 --> 03:22:01,550
Then if you need more than that,

3213
03:22:01,551 --> 03:22:06,080
you can hire our leadership and management
consultant company. Echelon fun. We are

3214
03:22:07,940 --> 03:22:12,500
the premier leadership consulting company
in the entire world,

3215
03:22:13,700 --> 03:22:18,700
so we're the ones that teach the methods
and the techniques and the tactics and

3216
03:22:20,421 --> 03:22:24,770
procedures from extreme
ownership proven in combat.

3217
03:22:24,771 --> 03:22:29,771
So you can email contact us info national
on front.com we just had the muster

3218
03:22:32,420 --> 03:22:33,830
number two in New York City,

3219
03:22:35,350 --> 03:22:36,140
uh,

3220
03:22:36,140 --> 03:22:40,460
awesome event. If you
missed it, come to Texas,

3221
03:22:41,060 --> 03:22:45,920
July,
1314 Omni Barton creek resort and spa.

3222
03:22:45,921 --> 03:22:49,160
And again, forget about the spa. You're
not going to spa and I'll come to the spa.

3223
03:22:49,370 --> 03:22:52,730
Not happening, but well, what
will be happening as leadership.

3224
03:22:53,210 --> 03:22:57,260
We'll talk about combat leadership and
how to apply that to your business and to

3225
03:22:57,261 --> 03:23:00,380
your life. And if you can't make
Texas, it's okay. We got backup,

3226
03:23:00,381 --> 03:23:04,010
we got contingency operations.
If you can't come to Texas,

3227
03:23:04,130 --> 03:23:09,130
September 14th and 15th we will be back
in San Diego on my home turf where there

3228
03:23:10,071 --> 03:23:13,710
is no winter. We got big yards
and Barbara can you spoiled?

3229
03:23:16,160 --> 03:23:21,080
You're entitled abuse spoiled.
At this point in your life.

3230
03:23:21,110 --> 03:23:22,250
It's, it's, I'll take you,

3231
03:23:22,260 --> 03:23:27,260
I'll give you a pass on that until the
musters we can be found actually on the

3232
03:23:27,831 --> 03:23:29,660
interwebs,
on Twitter,

3233
03:23:29,720 --> 03:23:33,510

3234
03:23:33,910 --> 03:23:35,180
I'm going to find it.
There.

3235
03:23:35,510 --> 03:23:40,070

Okay.

3240
03:23:55,970 --> 03:23:58,910
Echo, you got anything
else? Nope, that's it man.

3241
03:24:00,620 --> 03:24:05,090
Gentlemen, who was real
pleasure. Absolutely. Yeah.

3242
03:24:05,230 --> 03:24:06,980
Any other closing
comments you want to make?

3243
03:24:09,770 --> 03:24:10,603
Okay.

3244
03:24:11,110 --> 03:24:16,110
I definitely wouldn't advise
smoking PCP taking a list.

3245
03:24:17,840 --> 03:24:21,760
No, seriously. I'm not.
Thanks for having me on, man.

3246
03:24:21,761 --> 03:24:25,510
It's a real pleasure. You know, I, you're,

3247
03:24:25,540 --> 03:24:28,630
you've become a big inspiration.

3248
03:24:28,900 --> 03:24:33,900
I love reading your quotes and your
books and I'm listening to the podcast.

3249
03:24:35,411 --> 03:24:39,820
It's sometimes it's exactly the
kick in the ass that I need and uh,

3250
03:24:40,330 --> 03:24:44,130
I appreciate that. And, uh, and again,

3251
03:24:44,131 --> 03:24:48,570
I'm very honored and proud to have been
a part of the soundtrack to your life.

3252
03:24:49,740 --> 03:24:51,970
Indeed. Yes, indeed. Uh,

3253
03:24:52,160 --> 03:24:57,160
I'd also like to give a shout out to my
better half who without her I definitely

3254
03:24:57,961 --> 03:25:01,050
wouldn't be doing so well.
My book would not be as good.

3255
03:25:01,051 --> 03:25:04,380
It would probably suck and my
life would definitely suck.

3256
03:25:04,381 --> 03:25:08,130
So Laura Leaf land again.
I love you and uh,

3257
03:25:09,390 --> 03:25:12,660
if my sons are listening to this podcast,
I love you boys and uh,

3258
03:25:14,540 --> 03:25:15,320
okay.

3259
03:25:15,320 --> 03:25:19,910
Keep up the good work and keep your
training going and keep checking out.

3260
03:25:19,930 --> 03:25:22,190
Jocko is podcasts you
might learn a thing or two.

3261
03:25:24,900 --> 03:25:26,440
Awesome. Well, uh,

3262
03:25:26,760 --> 03:25:30,360
Harley obviously thanks for coming
on the show and such a pleasure man.

3263
03:25:30,570 --> 03:25:35,570
Thanks for the years of music that you
gave to me and millions of other kids

3264
03:25:39,660 --> 03:25:41,730
that needed to hear it.

3265
03:25:43,590 --> 03:25:46,950
And thanks for making it through what
you've made it through and coming out on

3266
03:25:46,951 --> 03:25:48,780
the other side with a,

3267
03:25:49,410 --> 03:25:54,410
with a positive outlook and a positive
impact in a positive message that

3268
03:25:59,160 --> 03:26:02,130
it's
never too late.

3269
03:26:03,250 --> 03:26:08,250
It is never too dark and that
we can always turn things around

3270
03:26:11,970 --> 03:26:14,490
as long as you're alive.
There is hope.

3271
03:26:17,500 --> 03:26:18,333
Yes indeed.

3272
03:26:20,020 --> 03:26:25,020
Thanks to everyone else that's listening
and supporting and spreading the word.

3273
03:26:26,410 --> 03:26:30,640
And as always to the folks
in the military out there,

3274
03:26:32,860 --> 03:26:37,860
we salute you and thank you all
for holding the demons at the gate.

3275
03:26:39,690 --> 03:26:40,523
Okay.

3276
03:26:40,630 --> 03:26:44,930
And to the police and law
enforcement and firefighters and he,

3277
03:26:44,931 --> 03:26:46,810
mts and first responders.

3278
03:26:47,710 --> 03:26:50,380
Thanks for fighting
the demons here at home

3279
03:26:52,480 --> 03:26:53,313
and

3280
03:26:55,550 --> 03:27:00,160
to anyone else that's out
there that's listening, that's

3281
03:27:01,520 --> 03:27:02,250
okay.

3282
03:27:02,250 --> 03:27:06,510
Started to go down,
down in that hole,

3283
03:27:06,540 --> 03:27:08,310
down into that more

3284
03:27:10,410 --> 03:27:15,410
trapped in the chains of
depression or addiction or rage.

3285
03:27:23,320 --> 03:27:26,830
When you're down in that hole,

3286
03:27:28,820 --> 03:27:29,653
look up,

3287
03:27:33,920 --> 03:27:34,753
look up,

3288
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:39,230
look up and recognize
that there is a way out.

3289
03:27:39,260 --> 03:27:41,680
There is a path for you to take.

3290
03:27:42,850 --> 03:27:43,640
Yeah.

3291
03:27:43,640 --> 03:27:48,480
And it's not an easy path.
It'll be a fight.

3292
03:27:48,910 --> 03:27:53,910
It will be a fight that demands focus
and work and tenacity and of course

3293
03:27:57,660 --> 03:27:58,493
discipline.

3294
03:28:01,920 --> 03:28:05,280
But it is that path,

3295
03:28:07,610 --> 03:28:11,750
that hard path,
that hard path of discipline

3296
03:28:13,670 --> 03:28:16,610
that will lead you to freedom.

3297
03:28:19,580 --> 03:28:20,990
So stay on that path.

3298
03:28:24,400 --> 03:28:26,000
And until next time,

3299
03:28:27,590 --> 03:28:31,820
this is Harley Flanagan and deco and Jocko

3300
03:28:33,590 --> 03:28:33,970
help.
