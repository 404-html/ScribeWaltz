1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,990
Jocko, you've talked about how getting
into into adversarial relationships is

2
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:09,250
pointless, but people always get into
adversarial relationships with me.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,640
I've been told them scary
before but never understood why.

4
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:20,060
My question is how do I maneuver on this
without acting like a little weakling

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,260
bitch for lack of a better term,
to appear less threatening.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,400
Do I just accept that I
rub people the wrong way?

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,630
So this is a question there.

8
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:39,410
I'll do my best to answer cause it's
time for definitely time for some self

9
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:42,650
awareness here for the
individual asking this question.

10
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,880
It sounds like you are,
you know,

11
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:51,590
a big abrasive person that is aggressive
and intimidates people and I know what

12
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,780
it's like to be that
person because I could be,

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,330
I could come across as intimidating.
I know that um,

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,080
I can definitely come across as
aggressive. I can be aggressive.

15
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:04,960
I am aggressive in many ways, abrasive.
I don't know that not necessarily uh,

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,153
um,

17
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,820
categorizes me because I'm very cautious
about not being abrasive because if I'm

18
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:17,480
being abrasive with people, am I building
a relationship under, make any progress?

19
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,370
The answer's obviously no.
So something,

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,210
the thing is when I hear
this type of question,

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,130
okay,

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,750
I, I think that there's some little bit
of insecurity going on here, right? Some,

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,380
a little bit of, hey that's not
an insult. That's what I sense.

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,960
Cause everyone's got insecurity's I do.

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,080
Everybody does and but,

26
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,630
but the fact that you asked this question,

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,750
I'm hoping that that means you want to
make some kind of improvement. All right.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,940
Do you want to get better? And you know,

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,920
I'm a little worried that you might just
be looking for like reinforcement cause

30
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:59,580
people think jock was big and aggressive.
So if I say I'm big and aggressive,

31
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:01,170
I'll, you know, jock, who
was just going to say,

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,180
hey those people are just scared of you
and they don't deserve your mercy or you

33
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:09,210
don't. You Do, you use your intimidation
factor. Overrun those people. Right?

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,160
That might be what you're looking for,
but you're not going to get that here.

35
00:02:14,161 --> 00:02:15,150
And the reason you're not gonna get that,

36
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,950
here's cause that's not going to help you.

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
It's not going to help
you achieve your goals.

38
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:24,180
Can you talk about people
being scared of you?

39
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:28,980
But the fact likely is,
is that you're the one that scared.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay.

41
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,750
In, in, you actually said it yourself,

42
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,440
that you don't want to appear to be weak.

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,740
You don't want to appear to be a bitch.
Yeah.

44
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,470
That is that feeling.
That's fear.

45
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,320
That's fear. It's fear of looking
weak. It's fear of looking wrong.

46
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:55,280
It's fear of failure and
it's fear of vulnerability.

47
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,300
And those are, those are, those are real.

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,820
And if you're, you know, everybody should
be feeling those fears. I at some level,

49
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,090
but you have to overcome those fears.
If you don't,

50
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,300
then how are you ever
going to step up if you're,

51
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:17,080
if you're too afraid to be wrong, how are
you? You're going to answer a question.

52
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,290
If you're too afraid to

53
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,500
look weak, how are you ever going
to exposures? Any weaknesses?

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,090
And if you don't expose any weaknesses,

55
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,910
well just build a bunker around yourself
and sit in there by herself. You.

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,620
So as a leader, we know that up
and down the chain of command,

57
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,830
you need to develop
relationships, right? That's what,

58
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,540
that's what you're supposed to do.

59
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,780
That means you need to
communicate with people.

60
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,580
That means you need to talk and you need
to listen and you need to develop trust.

61
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:54,030
And one of the best ways to develop trust
with other people is by exposing some

62
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,390
vulnerability, by saying, hack on,

63
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,570
I'm not quite sure how to do
this. Or Hey, echo, hey, can you,

64
00:04:02,571 --> 00:04:04,550
can you help me with this
issue I have going on here?

65
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,690
I don't know how to solve it.

66
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,090
That's ways that you build trust
and thereby build relationships.

67
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,100
And it's hard to do that because
you don't want to look stupid.

68
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:20,090
You don't want to look weak.

69
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:25,091
You don't want to admit you don't know
something because you want to be Mr.

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,580
Strong and know everything
in.

71
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:32,340
So you're probably putting up a front.

72
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,800
Yeah,

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,410
an aggressive front and abrasive front.

74
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,700
It's a wall to keep people intimidated.

75
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:43,820
And then in your mind you
think it's not my fault,

76
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:46,940
it's their fault because
they're scared of me.

77
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:49,910
It's their fault because
I'm so intimidating.

78
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:57,230
So that is not good. And then you get
the you're kind of closing statement.

79
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,560
Should you just accept that I rub
people the wrong way. You can.

80
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,050
You can't accept that you
rub people the wrong way,

81
00:05:04,051 --> 00:05:06,840
but then you might as well accept right
then and there that you're never going

82
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:09,060
to be a true leader.
That's,

83
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:11,940
you're never going to build
any relationships that
you're never going to inspire

84
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:16,680
anybody and you're never going to
be the leader of a bad ass unified,

85
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,900
high performing team,
probably not worth it.

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,560
And the, the better thing to do

87
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,640
is to humble yourself,

88
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,020
is to open yourself up to the pain and
the discomfort of displaying weakness and

89
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,370
error and failure

90
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,860
and open yourself up to try
and be nice to other people

91
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,480
instead being scared of what's going
to happen if you expose yourself.

92
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,740
Go ahead and throw it out there,

93
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,503
act

94
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,950
pleasant to them so they
talk to you without fear.

95
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,710
And in doing those things,

96
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,200
you can overcome whatever
these under insecurities are.

97
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,470
And I dunno what the insecures you have.
It could be any number of things.

98
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:17,180
Maybe you don't think
you're smart as they are.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,520
Maybe you don't think you're
as well educated as they are.

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,900
Maybe you don't think that they have,

101
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:23,630
you have the strategic vision that they
have. Whatever those insecurities are,

102
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:26,810
it's all good. We all
got them. No big deal.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
But if you stop hiding
them and you own them,

104
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,923
hmm,

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,880
you will become not only a better leader,

106
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,100
but to become a better man.

107
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,850
So
take a breath

108
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:55,480
and get home
and take another crack at this gig.

109
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,773
You know,

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,180
I think losing your
temper is a huge red flag.

111
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,780
Like I've always said and always will
say huge red flag if you ever lose your

112
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,610
temper. And I'm nothing screaming, yell.

113
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,900
I'm just saying you're getting
mad and displaying that
anger. Well, what's really,

114
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,050
what's really what's really bad is when
people utilize their temper as a tool to

115
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,250
scare and intimidate people.
So they go, all, man,

116
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,680
I don't want to say anything to Jocko
on this cause you got to go loses,

117
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,740
loses temper, whose mind
go crazy like that. That's,

118
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,600
that's me using it as a tool,

119
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,150
which is not good because you're
not building any relationship too.

120
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:37,850
You're not getting any input from people.
You're, you're not respected by the way.

121
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,690
People might fear you if you have a
bad temper, but they don't respect you.

122
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,780
They're not calling you up
and asking you for advice.

123
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,760
They're not wanting you to run
their, their project. Yeah.

124
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,630
No. And they're not motivated to do
good by you when you're not around.

125
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,620
They are definitely not motivated to
do good by you and you're not around.

126
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,380
In fact, the only reason they do
anything is out of fear, you know?

127
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,290
Whereas if you have a
relationship with them,

128
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:08,300
you could leave for six months and the
people that know you and respect you and

129
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:09,530
care about you and have relation to,

130
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,360
there's still busting their ass to
do the best they can for you. Yup.

131
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,450
Glad when you come back to yeah.
Yeah. In, in a lot of times,

132
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,380
like,
so the adversarial relationship thing,

133
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,010
there's a way to look at it is
it kind of takes both you to,

134
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,040
to kind of cultivate an
adversarial relationship. It goes,

135
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,710
goes for any kind of relationship, but,
well, yes and no, it will. Okay. So,

136
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,480
um, you, you keep being
a dick to me, we'll say.

137
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,840
And if I just keep being nice to you,

138
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,170
even though you're being a dick to me,
even though we have a job to do what it,

139
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,600
yes, all in all that and we're
maintaining the integrity of that.

140
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,180
But I'm keep being nice to you.
You keep being a dick to me.

141
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,430
I keep being nice to you after a while.

142
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,190
The way that shakes
itself out is I'm be nice.

143
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,970
You know the next person. Yeah,
no. Well, here's the thing.

144
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,030
We're still getting the job done and
whatever, but my re, my response to you,

145
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:07,170
if you'd be a dick to me is not be a
dick back or defend. You know, it's,

146
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,150
it's just be nice. Oh, you know, it's a,

147
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:11,670
where are you going to say it
shakes out as it shakes out.

148
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,580
The one guy who's a Dick stands out.

149
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:16,723
Yeah.

150
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,910
So everyone's being cool and
when all is said and done,

151
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,290
we're just dealing with one
guy is a dick. So if you, if,

152
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,070
if you cultivate the adversarial
relationship, it's like, okay,

153
00:09:28,071 --> 00:09:31,160
you have this competitive situation
now to people that, you know,

154
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,220
or Dick or guys that are jerks,
which ended up with, yeah,

155
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:35,780
and let's say you were a
nice guy to begin with.

156
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,410
Don't become a jerk now.
You know, it's true. So,

157
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,710
and I'm saying that because a lot of times
if you're like gay people were Crete,

158
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,420
uh,
creating adversarial relationship with me,

159
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,550
you're going to play a part in that
relationship, you know? Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,230
Yeah. And the thing with this
question, and you know, I mean,

161
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:01,410
even the terminology used,
which, which is, you know,

162
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,030
how do I maneuver on this without
acting like a little bitch? Literally.

163
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,040
So you gotta figure, not, not, you know,
not the most mature person. So I'm,

164
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm guessing, hey man, you're probably
22, you know, 24 something like that,

165
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:19,830
or you're haven't matured a lot and you're
27, but you're still caught in that,

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,850
in that game. And I think a
lot of times, you know, uh,

167
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,510
people when they,
when they meet me or they,

168
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,470
they learn about me or I
show up at their business,

169
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,380
they think I'm going to
be that guy that's like,

170
00:10:34,381 --> 00:10:37,200
we're going to just come in here and,
and it's,

171
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,400
it's always really cool
when people go, man, yeah,

172
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:45,330
I didn't think of that. It's, Oh, you
have this approach that we didn't expect.

173
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,420
And I'm like, yeah, you know, and by
now most people kind of, you know,

174
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,500
at this stage and echelon front,
and when I show up some work,

175
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,250
people have listened to as they know
where I'm coming from now, but you know,

176
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,900
two years ago,
you know,

177
00:10:57,901 --> 00:11:02,620
they expected this big sergeant slaughter
type thing to go down these folks to

178
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,320
whip these people in shape.
And,

179
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,640
and my guess is that the individual that
asks this question was kind of thinking

180
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,260
he would get some moral support from me.

181
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,950
And I'm trying to give them moral support
because I want her to be successful

182
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:16,170
because I want him to go out
and dominate in the world.

183
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,430
But to go out and dominate in the world,
you have to be a a chess player,

184
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,440
not a checkers player.
You gotta,

185
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:26,130
you gotta think you gotta
use the relationships.

186
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:29,010
You've got to use indirect warfare
to go out there and be blunt,

187
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:33,480
force trauma and everybody, it'll
get you, it'll get you, you know,

188
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:37,920
it'll get you a, a quarter of
the way there if you're lucky.

189
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,280
And then it'll, it won't get you
the rest of the way. So just, just,

190
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:45,180
it's no big deal, man. You're young. You
got some learning to do. That's awesome.

191
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,150
I wish I would have been smart enough
to ask this question when I was a young,

192
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:51,840
stupid 23 year old. You
got some, you're thinking,

193
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,910
you recognize that you're in a situation,
so all you gotta do is just, uh,

194
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,250
just start taking a different approach,

195
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,800
a little bit more of an indirect approach,
a little bit more of an open mind,

196
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:03,160
a little bit more humility.
Don't worry about looking weak when you,

197
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,280
the people that are scared to look weak
are the people that are weak. Right.

198
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,610
The people that are okay being exposed
are the people that are strong.

199
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,120
Like I'm totally comfortable
in my leadership capabilities.

200
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,760
So when I have an issue, I'm like, Hey,
I don't feel comfortable with this.

201
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,740
I'm not worried that somebody
is not going to say like, oh,

202
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:23,290
well we don't think you can
handle this, that, no, no,
no. I actually, I know I can.

203
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,750
I've been in worse situation.
So what he got. Yeah.

204
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,980
So if you're paranoid about looking weak,
it means you probably are weak.

205
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,710
If you don't care about
being looking weak,

206
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,900
it probably means that you're coming
along, you know you're doing pretty good.

207
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,850
Yeah.
Check.

208
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:45,190
So you don't need a hard
shell if you have a hardcore,

209
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:50,520
but you need art shell. If you have a
softcore yes. That is true kind of thing.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,640
Yes. Did you just make
that up? Yeah, but I mean,

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,360
I'm not looking at it like, Dang, that
was deep. I'm not, I'm not thinking that.

212
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,460
But that is a true statement.
If you're,

213
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:05,461
if you're fundamentally sound on the
internal and the meaningful structure of

214
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:12,440
your, of your being, then
you can withstand attacks.

215
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:15,420
So you don't need to put up a
big wall. Right, right. You know?

216
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,200
But if you're fundamentally weak
internally and the fundamentals of your,

217
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,850
of your being are weak, then you need
to put up a big wall of protection.

218
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,160
You need to go round
and blow up to people.

219
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:32,161
And he made me weapons up there
to really keep him away from guns.

220
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,700
Some of the,
some heavies.
