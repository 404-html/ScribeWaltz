00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:06,290
This is Jocko podcast number
47 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,670
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,030
And I went a little long
with a couple of reviews.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,860
We've done some interviews.
We interviewed JP Denelle,

5
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,430
and I've got a ton of really
solid books that I'm reading.

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,370
I'm learning a lot from all of them and
just getting a lot out of those books

7
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:40,641
that I'm reading right now about war and
about leadership and about human nature

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,070
and about life,

9
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:49,071
but kind of failed to answer
questions for the last few podcasts.

10
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,010
Questions from the interwebs,

11
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,950
from everybody out there that's listening
and the question had been piling up.

12
00:00:55,951 --> 00:01:00,951
So tonight we're going to simply dive
into some questions from you all out

13
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:06,310
there. So let's get right
to it. Echo Charles. Yes.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,950
Question number one,
what do he got Jocko,

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,360
do you think that most MMA fighters
have what it takes to be seals,

16
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,980
the mental and physical,

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,760
the brutal weight cut the brutal fight
camp and stepping into a cage with a

18
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:25,710
train and a elite opponent?
Well,

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,950
this is one of those questions where
you might think there's like a really

20
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:32,730
definitive answer,
but there isn't really,

21
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,210
some MMA fighters could definitely
be great seals for sure.

22
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,350
Some of them actually wouldn't
stand a chance as deals.

23
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,490
And there's a lot of things that make
people quit and not want to be seals or

24
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,980
quit during seal training.
You know you've got the Walker.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,270
Some people don't like to water, some
people are uncomfortable in the water,

26
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,000
great athletes,
not good in the water.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,260
Some people don't like the
cold and they can understand,

28
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:03,120
they can take all kinds of
punishment of physical nature,

29
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,680
but they don't like the cold.

30
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Some people don't like heights and you
get to the top of a 40 or 50 foot cargo

31
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,460
net and you've got to climb over
that little pole at the top,

32
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,590
get to the other side.
Some people don't like that.

33
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,930
Some people can't do some
simple stuff like memorize.

34
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,620
You can't memorize certain facts.
And there's a,

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,160
there is a intellectual
level that you have to have.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,350
Some people aren't situationally
aware, right? So some of
these, like for instance,

37
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:31,531
you know,

38
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:34,740
you don't use certain MMA fighters who
are real wild and it's one of their good

39
00:02:34,741 --> 00:02:37,590
characteristics is that they're,
they're kind of out of control.

40
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,320
It helps them do wild things and a fight,
unexpected things.

41
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,070
You can't be like that in the kill house.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,890
We'd go in live fire,
right? You can't have that.

43
00:02:46,891 --> 00:02:49,800
Why you need to be able to suppress
it and some people can't suppress it.

44
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:52,590
So what you'd end up with someone is
someone that's gonna have safety issues

45
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,550
because they there to instinctual and
they can't get those instincts under

46
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,384
control.

47
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,220
Some people might have too much endurance,
but not enough strength to,

48
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,500
some people might have too much
strength and not enough endurance.

49
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,050
Some people are injury prone,
right?

50
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:12,850
Some people are just injury prone
and it's not their fault. Many cases,

51
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:15,130
but they are and,
and then you take,

52
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:20,131
so that's sort of the things that it
takes to be in the seal teams that would,

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,640
could hold up or trip up somebody
that's just standard MMA fighter.

54
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,650
Now the same thing is true with seals.

55
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:33,760
That would be MMA fighters, right? Or, or
could seal potentially be an MMA fighter.

56
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,540
And there's been,

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,130
there's been a few sales out of that if
you don't better fought really well and

58
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:41,830
good fighters and all that.
But to make a blanket statement,

59
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,840
there's going to be things that
trip people up. And for instance,

60
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,600
some guys in the seal teams there,
they're not the best athlete. Their,

61
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,610
their athletic ability is not as high
as it might need to be to be a true

62
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,550
competitor in MMA. You
know, whether that's,

63
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,610
they don't have the explosiveness or
they don't have the coordination of the

64
00:04:06,611 --> 00:04:09,730
flexibility, there's some thing that's
going to make them not competitive.

65
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,600
And normally those guys, I mean sometimes
they might not be the best seals,

66
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,463
you know,

67
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,060
but some of those guys are super smart
and so the reason that they're good seals

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,180
because they're just, they're
just tactically sound in
order. Really good leaders,

69
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,000
they're never going to beat people on
the range shooting cause they're just not

70
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,040
that coordinated.
I don't have the hand eye coordination,

71
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,770
but they're good seals anyways.

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,580
But when you put them in a purely
physical competition like MMA,

73
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,340
I shouldn't say, well most a more
physical on physical competition like MMA,

74
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,210
they're not going to do
well. And of course obviously
there's a skillset, right?

75
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,200
MMA fighters train MMA all the time.
That's what they do.

76
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,650
They train Jujitsu and boxing and
wrestling and more tie in judo.

77
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,330
That's what they do. And seals also
train all the time. But guess what?

78
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,080
When you're in seal team,
you're not just training,

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,450
just fighting, right? You're training,

80
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:04,610
shooting and you're training
tactics and your training,

81
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:08,590
patrolling and land navigation
of parachuting in combat
diving and fast roping,

82
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:12,950
rappelling and waterborne operations,
all this stuff.

83
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,750
And then on top of all that stuff,

84
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:17,240
which is the stuff that you
actually really need to train,

85
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,220
then they put on a level of mixed martial
arts training to make sure that if you

86
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,390
are,
for whatever reason,

87
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,960
without a weapon or if you need to handle
somebody that doesn't have a weapon,

88
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:31,070
and so therefore you might not be in the
right to just shoot him and kill him.

89
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,270
You got to have you all
been handling yourself.

90
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:35,540
So there's some level of MMA training,

91
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,500
some fundamental Jiu Jitsu skills,
some fundamental striking skills,

92
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:42,080
some fundamental wrestling
skills that that seals get.

93
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,740
But it's not at the level of what a
real MMA fighter is going to have.

94
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,750
So
with all that,

95
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,100
I think there is a,

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,770
a good percentage of MMA fighters that
would make it through seal training and

97
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:01,850
be good seals and there's a good number
of seals that would probably make really

98
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:05,900
good solid MMA fighters if they chose
to do that and focus their lives on it.

99
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:07,760
Cause there are some common
traits with both of them.

100
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,190
Both of them take hard work.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,240
Both of them take some level
of physical suffering. Right.

102
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,580
Grind it both.
I mean you,

103
00:06:16,581 --> 00:06:19,520
you've been around when we're running
an MMA camps for people, it's a grind.

104
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,140
It's a grind. It's a day in,
day out grind. Now there's
some luxury to that grind.

105
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,640
There's some luxury that grind because
when you're in an MMA camp, yeah,

106
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,430
you work hard as hell from,
you know,

107
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,160
seven in the morning until nine o'clock
doing your strength and conditioning.

108
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,760
But then you're going to go home and
you're going to get a massage and you're

109
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:38,540
gonna get,

110
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,350
you're gonna have some really good food
standing by and you're going to sit down,

111
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:43,184
you're going to relax,

112
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,460
and then at 11 o'clock you can go back
to the gym and now you're going to do,

113
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,240
you're,

114
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,650
you're grappling training and you're
going to train really hard for an hour,

115
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,460
maybe an hour and a half.
You can do drills. You'd get
worn out again, and then,

116
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,460
then you're going to go eat some lunch.
You're going to relax,

117
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:01,040
you're going to go back home.
You're going to lay down,

118
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,260
maybe take a little ice bath,
then his little Jacuzzi.

119
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,370
So there's some luxury to the MMA
did in the seal teams. There's not,

120
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,003
it's not happening.

121
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,290
You're just getting ground
down when you're going
through the basic training and

122
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,020
when you're going through, you know,
the advanced workup training, you're,

123
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,720
you're just getting beat down
all the time. It's a grind,

124
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,510
but both of them are a grind.

125
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,370
And that's why I think though the work
ethic that comes with a really good seal

126
00:07:25,371 --> 00:07:28,490
or a really good MMA fighter,
there's a very strong similarity there.

127
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,290
And the ability to take that grind is,

128
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,220
is what I think that that
intrinsic discipline is what
would make the crossover

129
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:38,640
occur.

130
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,890
So that would make a seal into a good
MMA fighter or an MMA fighter into a good

131
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:47,810
seal or a good special operations guy.
Yeah. And and there's the crossover.

132
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:52,180
It's ultimately just like you said, it's
kind of hard to, I identify it overall,

133
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,210
the thrilled general cause like
an MMA fighter is training. Sure.

134
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,520
He's training to be a better
MMA fighter in general,

135
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,580
but mainly it's training for an event.

136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,690
So knows okay it's going
to be this many rounds,

137
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,190
it's going to be this long per round.

138
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,710
I'm going to get this much rest for this
route and I'm training to win that. Yup.

139
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Real specific.
So the training is,

140
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,610
if it's good training,

141
00:08:16,611 --> 00:08:20,480
it's going to best train him to
function in that event and give them the

142
00:08:20,481 --> 00:08:25,130
parameters. Yeah. Combat Navy seal, not
like that parameter you straight up.

143
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:28,260
Can you, a great example of this is
Tim Kennedy, right? Tim Kennedy's, uh,

144
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,120
Greenbrae special forces guy and
he's a complete beast, you know,

145
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,160
and he's a great example of a guy that
has the commitment, the discipline,

146
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,320
the dedication to be a,
a special forces guy.

147
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:42,770
And that translates right into how
he works out and trains for fights.

148
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,170
That guy trains like a madman for fights.

149
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,940
And I think that's a great example of
somebody not only can do one or the other,

150
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,780
he does both, you know, know real time
he's in it. He's fighting November 15th.

151
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:57,390
Right.
That gets Rashad Evans so good on him.

152
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,920
And I actually had like another
follow on question to this,

153
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:06,630
which is in the same
arena, who would win? Yeah.

154
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,291
Who would win,

155
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:12,291
who would win in a fight between a
UFC fighter and a seal team member.

156
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,550
And I'll just go ahead and broaden
that out to make it like, you know,

157
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,570
a special operations guy because people
put special operations personnel onto a

158
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:27,570
pedestal of you know,
totally being able to kick everyone's ass,

159
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,433
which is,

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,650
well to answer the question
in its simplest form,

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,340
if the,

162
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:40,340
if there was a fight and it's
mixed martial arts competition,

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,440
so like in a cage what you
were just talking about with
a referee and that's the

164
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:48,180
way it's going to be and there's
five minute rounds and there's five,

165
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:48,830
five minute rounds,

166
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,340
where is he was going to win this fight
barring a massive weight difference

167
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,350
and and a rare special operations guy
that has a high level of training.

168
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,930
If you take a 175 pound special operations
guy that just trained like a normal

169
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,780
special operations guy has,
doesn't have any specialties,

170
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,640
we're not talking Tim Kennedy,

171
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,400
we're not talking to any of these guys
that actually are committed and getting

172
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:21,240
into it and train outside the
actual discipline in their job.

173
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,920
If it's just a normal run of the mill
guy from the special operations community

174
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,320
against a professional UFC fighter
in the same weight class, it's

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,530
the UFC fighters going to win.
That's, those are the facts. And um,

176
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,320
again, that's an occasion. And I
know this because you know what,

177
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:45,321
I've trained with a lot of really high
level UFC fighters and I mean I've

178
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:46,500
trained with,

179
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,500
with Randy and Tito and I've trained with
Brandon Vera and with Quentin Rampage

180
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,050
Jackson and I've chain with Dan Henderson
and Matt Front of train with Bisbing

181
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,710
too soft trained with a lot of these guys.
You don't,

182
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,230
none of them at a like all the time,
although brand of air.

183
00:11:02,231 --> 00:11:06,950
And I used to try to get there all
the time, but, and he's awesome. Um,

184
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,500
but I trained with those guys, you know,
I trained with those guys and you know,

185
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:12,990
not to mention Dean Dean lister,
I've been trained with forever.

186
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,480
So I've trained and when
I trained with those guys,

187
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:20,481
a majority of the time I would train
grappling specific so we wouldn't be just

188
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,600
doing straight MMA. So
we're training in, in a,

189
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,320
in an arena that's geared towards me,
you know,

190
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:32,280
some somewhere that I'm actually good at,
right.

191
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:35,100
Have been trained you just for 20 years.
And so

192
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,760
when I go in the cage with those guys,
or when I've trained with those guys,

193
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm competitive with them,
you know, so, you know, we,
we have good training, right?

194
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,180
We're, we're, it's not like,
yeah, we have good training.

195
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,890
It's good competitive
training with all those guys.

196
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,530
But I've been training
this stuff for a long time.

197
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,310
So my magical special operations powers,
they,

198
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:01,220
I know what they are and they're
not real. Um, you're going to,

199
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,550
you have to learn how to fight to
be able to hang with these guys.

200
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:05,650
And if you don't know how to train,
if I put, you know, because I,

201
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:08,740
when I trained with a regular, you know,
got a seal that doesn't train, of course,

202
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:11,830
you, it's Jujitsu. You fricking
destroyed them. They have no chance.

203
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,870
So when, if you take a guy that's
just a normal guy that doesn't train,

204
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,610
they're going to get their
ass beat just like any other,

205
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:21,930
you'd get no magical powers. Will
you be tough? Sure. We'll you know,

206
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,050
and this is good. Like, you know,

207
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:25,330
you take your average seal and
you start teaching her Jujitsu,

208
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,250
they're great training partners
because they're strong,

209
00:12:27,251 --> 00:12:30,340
they have great endurance, they go
freaking hard, yet they don't quit.

210
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,040
They don't give up. They'll keep training
with you until they don't tap easy.

211
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:35,530
So yeah, they're great training partners
that end. The more you teach them,

212
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,390
the better they're going to get and
they're going to learn quickly because

213
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,340
they're going to be focused on it.
So that's all good.

214
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,400
But the fact of the matter is you
take a skilled and, and I, you know,

215
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,320
can you take a skilled UFC fighter and
it doesn't matter that you were a quote

216
00:12:47,321 --> 00:12:51,670
unquote, you know, navy seal or
special operations guy. That's,

217
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,350
that's just not going to happen.
So

218
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,480
now the,

219
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,480
the other kind of thing on this is if
you take both people now out of the cage

220
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,750
and you put them into a
survival type situation,

221
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,590
now the special operations person's going
to have a much better chance because

222
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,593
first of all,
they're gonna be able to,

223
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,000
they're going to try and avoid
the bad situation if they can.

224
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,250
And if they do have to fight,

225
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:26,251
they are much more likely to use some
kind of a improvised weapon to do some

226
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,640
kind of sneak attack,

227
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:31,960
to have backup right in the form of other
guys that you didn't realize were with

228
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,940
him. And all of a sudden you're
getting hit in the head with a bottle.

229
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,990
It's the professional fighter. Of
course, it has a huge advantage,

230
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,230
but there will be,
there is some,

231
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,950
when you get out of the cage
and there's no referee, there's,

232
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,360
there's some things that,
you know,

233
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:50,800
your average special operations guys
are going to be thinking about that your

234
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:55,050
normal person wouldn't be thinking
about in these situations. Um,

235
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,560
so, you know, that's why I said, you
know, just in general, first of all,

236
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,980
don't get any street fights. It's not
smart. It doesn't get you anywhere.

237
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,150
And you see guys that are in the military,
just in general,

238
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,220
they kind of have

239
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,880
another little level that they might
take things too, right? And that's,

240
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,010
that's, you know, you think you're
getting a little fist fight, right?

241
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:20,340
And you think all of them,
I'm in a borrow,

242
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,300
was getting a little fist fight with
this person. The next thing you know,

243
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,790
someone's biting off your nose,
right?

244
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,270
Or someone's ripping off
your ear or someone sticking
a fork in your eye because

245
00:14:28,271 --> 00:14:28,901
that's the kind of thing,

246
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:33,901
like that's the kind of thing that you
take one of these people who's trained in

247
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:36,880
that has a little switch in their
head that they go, oh, I'm going to,

248
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,880
I'm going to combat scenario right now
where this guy's attacking me and I'm

249
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:42,700
going to chew off. I'm going to chew off
his nose. I'm gonna read off as a year,

250
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,760
or how many gouged out his eyes? I'm
gonna do it right now as fast as I can.

251
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,550
So that's why,
you know,

252
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,730
just you got to use Costa
and I got actually one of my,

253
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,990
one of my buddies back in the day
there was,

254
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,020
we were in a bar and some guy who was
getting cocky and said something to a girl

255
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,100
and you know,
he knew the girl and Blah Blah Blah.

256
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,170
And there was whatever situation.

257
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,430
So my buddy's like, hey, hey,

258
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:15,920
can you go ahead and apologize that
girl, you know, cause that wasn't cool.

259
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,340
He said it all nice. Like, yeah,
like just all months and the guys,

260
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,140
you know what? And he
says, Hey, no, no problem.

261
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,510
I just, you said something to the
girl over there. You see her? Yeah,

262
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,640
we do with the red shirt on.
Yeah.

263
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:30,770
You said something to her and it was kind
of offensive. So if you could just go,

264
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:33,800
you know, apologize to her then, you
know, we're all good here and, and it,

265
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,110
what do you mean we're all good?
No,

266
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:40,980
I mean if you can just apologize to
her then we're all good. And you know,

267
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,640
the guy says something like, you
know, what are you going to do about?

268
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,610
And as he's finishing those words,
the guy was smoking a cigarette.

269
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,500
As he's finishing those words,

270
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,210
my buddy in a millisecond,
in a nanosecond,

271
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,220
like faster than you
can snap your fingers.

272
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,260
He snatches the cigarette out of the
guy's mouth and shoves it with absolute

273
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,360
laser target,
precision up,

274
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,510
the guys know a burning cigarette.

275
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:13,730
So this dude just, and he put
it, you put it in there deep.

276
00:16:13,731 --> 00:16:18,230
I don't even know how he did it. Like
a Ninja move. Well Baum, it's up there.

277
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,120
The dude collapses. I mean, can
you imagine? You know, I mean,

278
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,610
you've seen people like put a cigarette
out on their arm or whatever and it

279
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:28,790
leaves a scar for the rest of their life.
He shoved the cigarette,

280
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,020
the burning cigarettes up,

281
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:34,250
the guys knows the guy collapses to the
ground and just like screaming in it.

282
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,130
I mean, completely defenseless.
So that's the kind of thing.

283
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,700
Maybe that guy was a tough guy. Maybe
that guy was thinking, oh, I'm a boxer,

284
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,280
or whatever.
This guy might've been,

285
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:45,950
I don't even know because the fight was
over before it even started because the

286
00:16:45,951 --> 00:16:50,951
guy had a burning cigarette jammed up
in his nasal cavity in a split second

287
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:55,910
fights over. So that's the kind of thing
that let's be friends with each other.

288
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,460
Let's just try and treat each
other with respect out there.

289
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:01,820
So we're not getting into fights because
I've got a bunch of stories like that

290
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,950
and they don't end well,
you know,

291
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:08,900
if they don't end well and yeah,
that's kind of like,

292
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:12,650
um,
like special operations guys.

293
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:16,460
That's kind of an eye, I'm not
that guy that you're talking about.

294
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:17,870
He's not special operations guy.
Right?

295
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,490
That was just the guy that did the
cigarette up the nose. Oh no, he's a seal.

296
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,440
Oh yeah, he, when this was, this
was years ago, many, many years ago.

297
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,830
And yeah, he did it just like that. And
that's the kind of thing, like, again,

298
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:34,190
the guy that he's talking to thinks he's
a tough guy, thinks, oh, I'm a tough guy.

299
00:17:34,191 --> 00:17:38,080
Who, what's this? What's this
little guy talking to me?

300
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,670
Talking smack telling me you apologize.
I don't have to apologize anybody.

301
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,590
And this was also pre MMA days, but
you know, maybe the guy's a boxer,

302
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,670
maybe the guy's a wrestler, he
may, it might be a tough guy,

303
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,610
but I guess apparently when you
get a burning shoved up your nose,

304
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,680
you're not tough anymore.
Just goes over like that.

305
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,400
Yeah. Even, I mean, even better then
as an example, he is where first off,

306
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:59,980
if the guy, you know how the, how you
said he's saying it all calm like, hey,

307
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,950
just go ahead and apologize what? It
made me nervous, right? They're like, oh,

308
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:06,790
this guy's cute. Anyway, but
that's a side thing. So like, yeah,

309
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:11,230
so a special operations guy compared
to an MMA guy, he's, he's about every,

310
00:18:11,231 --> 00:18:14,230
he's thinking beyond the fight. He's
thinking straight up, this is a battle.

311
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,710
So how can I win this fucking war?
You know,

312
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,270
MMA fighter is thinking
like when we fight,

313
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,300
how am I going to beat you up with all
my skills? And he will typically will,

314
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,740
unless you have equal or better skills,
you're going to get beat up in a fight.

315
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:30,700
Yeah. So, but the tack that he liked,
the other guy, he's thinking tactical,

316
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,740
he's thinking, okay, you
know, he'll probably,

317
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,070
and according to the guys that I hang
around with, when they walk in a room,

318
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,260
just like a Jujitsu guy, when you, when
you, when a person is presented to you,

319
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,720
you're thinking you did two
already, you're thinking, okay,

320
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,980
from here a solid takedown
would come a special operators,

321
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,170
I could stick my pen in this guy's eyes
and there's the door and you know that,

322
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,850
you know, let's say, let's say other guys
just came in. Okay. So I got five guys,

323
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:58,840
he has like eight before any fight, no
fight, no nothing. This is just the way,

324
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:02,780
you know, the way that kind of the
mind works. And then, so yeah, if,

325
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,000
and he's planning like the your guy,
he had that planner Eddie, you know,

326
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:08,980
it's not like he was like,
oh, I'm just gonna attack in.

327
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,130
That just Kinda came about during the
process of the tech. He knew like, okay,

328
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:16,930
he had a cigarette. That's part of my
plan, my tactic, you know. Um, so yeah,

329
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:18,960
when you go outside of
just the site, no, no

330
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,540
too. Like you think about you, you
know, the Applegate, rex Applegate,

331
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,130
the whole idea of,

332
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,400
of self defense being gross motor
movements instead of fine motor movements.

333
00:19:30,501 --> 00:19:34,190
So if you ever look at
some of the old school, um,

334
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,880
unarmed combat from the military,

335
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,330
it's all based on this idea
that when you get in a fight,

336
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:44,060
you want to do these big gross
motor skills. In other words,

337
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:46,840
just giant movements with
your fist and with your legs.

338
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:50,270
So there's no really fine motor skills
because when your adrenaline's pumping

339
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:52,070
and you're in this fight,
you're going to make little mistakes.

340
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,340
Imagine the fine motor skills it takes
to grab a cigarette and it up someone's

341
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:58,060
nose in a split second node. Uh, you know,

342
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:01,310
there's another story and I don't
know why Tim, Tim Kennedy and I,

343
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:05,930
we talked about it before we came on the
podcast and we did, we didn't get to it.

344
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,750
Maybe we'll talk about it next time cause
we reviewed the whole story and it's a

345
00:20:08,751 --> 00:20:10,970
great story.
As you know,

346
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
he trained at the pit in San Louis
Obispo for awhile and seals used to do

347
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:22,030
training up there and one night and all
the guys that trained with Tim at the

348
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:25,790
time, um, they all used to work as
bouncers. And these guys are pro,

349
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,230
I'm going to say, I wish I could
remember the names of the crew,

350
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:34,610
but it's basically the old school
St Louis Obispo pit crew, right?

351
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:39,470
So it's, I want to say Gan Mcgee, Tim
Kennedy, Chuck Liddell, that crew,

352
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,590
right? Those guys before,
you know, the UFC was big.

353
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,230
Those guys all work as
bouncers in San Louis Obispo.

354
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,080
So some were doing some training up
in the area. It went out in town.

355
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,950
I've got into a fight and they,
the, the guys got their ask.

356
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,430
The seals got their ass kicked pretty
much by, and, and it was, you know,

357
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,350
Tim and I were laughing
about it because again,

358
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,360
this is before the UFC was really
popular and they got into a fight.

359
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,950
And of course,

360
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,950
not only is it a bunch of UFC or at least
high level MMA guys that are working

361
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:14,410
as bouncers. So they're sober fighting
against a bunch of drunk team guys.

362
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,740
And it was funny cause I,
they said, man, you know,

363
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:21,100
cause he seals got their asses kicked
in there, kind of like came back like,

364
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:25,270
Oh man, oh no, no, these belters were
tough. And then I go, well what was it?

365
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,060
And they're like Saint Louis Obispo.
And then somehow through the grapevine,

366
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:31,300
through the MMA grapevine there,
somebody told me back, Hey Jocko,

367
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:35,560
those guys that got, it was these guys,
it was guys from the pit. And I was like,

368
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,090
oh, okay. I know that story
by the way, cause a guy, he
was a new guy, he was like,

369
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,340
yeah, I'm not gonna say anything.
I think he's still in his name,

370
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:45,970
but he met him through the cake nuts,
you know, they'd come by and all that.

371
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,730
That's how I met JP. Kind
of the same way. But, um,

372
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,460
but he would always come in
the club that I worked at.

373
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,430
And so we kind of became friends,
you know. So after we're done,

374
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:57,120
we're eating at the same spot
and he's like, yeah, man, flu,

375
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,570
Chuck Ladell beat me up,
beat them down.

376
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:05,740
But we got in a fight in chocolate l
beat me up, hit him and knocked him down.

377
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:10,240
And I actually, yeah, that's what
happened. So that was a classic example.

378
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,140
And by the way,
you also,

379
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:14,650
something about while we're talking
about chocolate l uh, chuck,

380
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,610
when chuck has always been like awesome
to vets, especially wounded vets.

381
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,770
So chocolate l Yay.

382
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,860
If he's bouncing in a bar and you're
a vet and you get out of line,

383
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:26,650
you're going to get, you're going
get put down. But if you're a,

384
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:27,610
if you're a warrior,

385
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:31,060
that always impressed me about chuck
was he did some great stuff for the,

386
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,650
for the troops had been wounded overseas.

387
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:36,790
And that always gave me a lot
of respect for him. You know,

388
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,330
even more respect than I have for him
as being a great fighter. But anyways,

389
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,450
that kind of answers the question.
Um,

390
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:48,540
and so my overall broad guidance
here is train hard to do battle,

391
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,360
but do your battles in the gym?
Not In the street. It's, yeah.

392
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:57,880
It's only gonna get you either put in
jail or putting the hospital or both.

393
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,130
So I remember this guy we
trained with get his ear bit off,

394
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:07,840
remember? Yeah. Igor WPC. Yeah.
What's he in navy fill or is he, yeah,

395
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,950
he, he got out, but yes. Yes.
Yeah. He got into a street fight

396
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:17,470
and I mean he, he, he kicked the
guy's ass, right? He actually,

397
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,690
I think he more Thai clinch them,
put them down on the ground.

398
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,420
Got Cross side was kind of putting the,

399
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,120
putting the beat down on this
guy and the dude just big chunk,

400
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,400
big chunk of zero bigger than the chunk
that I'm bigger than chunked out Mike

401
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,350
Tyson to out. I mean, he was
a big chunk. I mean he's,

402
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,840
his ear is clearly has a bite taken
out of it. Like if you took a bite,

403
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,190
a big nice solid bite out of a piece of
pizza, that's what his ear looks like.

404
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,240
And you know, oh cool. You won the
fight, but you have no year left.

405
00:23:47,241 --> 00:23:48,110
So that's a bummer.

406
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,150
And that's another thing that's another
point to that is that sometimes these

407
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:56,930
self defense type people
think that you know, oh I'll,

408
00:23:56,931 --> 00:24:00,920
I'll call dries out. And
that's the indication that
I just kind of gave to that,

409
00:24:00,921 --> 00:24:03,320
hey, the navy seal Mike,
do something tricky to you.

410
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,570
Well the bottom line is that stuff is,

411
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:08,180
a lot of times it doesn't work
and that's a perfect case.

412
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,340
The guy bit is you're often thinks,
oh, the guy's going to give up. No,

413
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:13,360
cause he's not giving up. He beat
that means he went even harbor, right?

414
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:13,881
That means,
oh,

415
00:24:13,881 --> 00:24:17,060
now you've got a guy across the side
that's about to ruin your shoulder for the

416
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,620
rest of your life, for the
community, then put you to sleep.

417
00:24:18,621 --> 00:24:20,840
And it's just a bad situation.

418
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,660
So you can't just another
thing about those,

419
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,620
those thinking that you don't need to
train because you're going to do an engine

420
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,350
mover. You're going to shove a cigarette
at some guy's nose, no wrong answer.

421
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,290
Or you're going to bite the rear off
and you're going to, no, that's not,

422
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,190
it's not true.

423
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,360
You need to train so that you can get in
those positions and that you won't lose

424
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:41,870
these fights. And also you need to train
so that you don't have to get in fights.

425
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,880
Because most of the time when you're
getting to fights because your ego is

426
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:45,140
getting out of control and you can't send,

427
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,110
you can't handle it in your little brain.
You get all,

428
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,640
get all insecure about who you
are as a man. So you think of,

429
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:54,980
we've kicked this guy's ass and then
you're either getting your ass kicked,

430
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,570
you're getting put in the hospital,

431
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:01,550
or you're going to jail or you've got
a big lawsuit against you. So be smart.

432
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,540
Yeah, that's rough. Hey, remember
I'm bloodsport when he was like,

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,170
you know the coin,
you actually bill that,

434
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,930
remember blessing that the guy with
the coin and he's like, hey, you know,

435
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,410
whenever I'm gonna, if I can grab
it before you close your hand.

436
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,720
And the girl had something to
do with it and then he's like,

437
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,550
he grabs it, he closed. Then
he's like, ah, you know,

438
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:28,470
I still feel the coin in my hand kind of
thing. He looks, he switched the coin.

439
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,010
That's kind of what your friend did with
a cigarette when he shoved it in the

440
00:25:32,011 --> 00:25:36,660
guy sinus cavity. Cause it's like
super fast, you know and but precise.

441
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,340
But you can't count on that move.
And that's my point. All right,

442
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,380
kicking it off.

443
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,430
Let's go to question
number two shoe Jocko.

444
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,070
What if I don't have time to explain
the why to my troops for decision I'm,

445
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:55,440
I'm making during an operation
US army first lieutenant.

446
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,180
So awesome. Thanks for your
service. US Army First Lieutenant,

447
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,740
get some and I,
I talk about

448
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,930
troops and people in general
never wanting a pain,

449
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,860
a plan to be imposed upon them.
And so that's,

450
00:26:14,861 --> 00:26:17,660
that's what this question is kind of based
around. Cause I'm going to say, look,

451
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:20,290
do you know you don't want to just force
people to do some plan. You want to say,

452
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,930
Hey, what do you think you
should do? And Hey, here's,

453
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,820
here's what we're doing and
here's why we're doing it.

454
00:26:24,821 --> 00:26:27,940
This is why it's important that gets
people to take ownership of it and

455
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:31,160
therefore they do a better job.
So he must have heard me say that.

456
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,781
Now he's saying,
look,

457
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:34,600
sometimes I ain't got time to begin
to be explained in the why when we're

458
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:35,560
getting this going on.

459
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:40,561
And that's why this idea of explaining
the why is true 99% of the time in an

460
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,910
administrative situation,

461
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,590
in a situation where things are under
control and we've got time to think about

462
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:50,190
what's happening, that's when you can go
and say, Hey, what's your, what's your,

463
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,440
you know, what do you think? How
do you think we should do this?

464
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,650
This is why I want to accomplish this.
This is the commander's intent.

465
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,680
You can do it and all that stuff.
And that makes sense. Again,

466
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,860
in a administrative situation when there's
chaos and when there's May Hamot and

467
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:09,420
when there's uncertainty,
actually the opposite is true.

468
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,500
You actually want your troops to
you.

469
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,700
They they want,

470
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,760
they want to see and hear
clear directives from you.

471
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,440
They want to know what they should
do in no uncertain terms. And it's,

472
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,810
you can think of situations where if
you've seen, let's say a car accident,

473
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,600
right? And you see people
that are kind of frazzled,

474
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,760
if someone steps up into that situation,

475
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:40,230
don't one's doing anything that
they're supposed to be doing.

476
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,560
If someone says steps up and says you
to start dragging that person over,

477
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,610
there you go. Call nine one one. They
actually teach that. You know, when you,

478
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:51,090
when you're learning about how
to handle a traumatic situations,

479
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,210
somebody needs to step up, step
back, take charge of the situation.

480
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,890
Everybody wants that to happen.

481
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,970
And that's true in a combat scenario.
Again,

482
00:27:59,971 --> 00:28:02,310
this is different from when
we're in the rear and we're,

483
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,420
we're formulating a plan and were safely
going over whatever ideas we have.

484
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,730
And that's when you want to get impact,

485
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:12,750
input and feedback and
you let your subordinate
leadership come up with a plan.

486
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:17,250
That's all good. But that's not
true during, uh, like I said,

487
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:22,230
during a pressure situation, when
there's a critical scenario unfolding,

488
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:24,270
people want to be led.

489
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,530
Now when you lead them
in those situations,

490
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:32,370
you can still give orders
by Commander's intent.

491
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,760
You can still just given tent.
So an example of that,

492
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,510
and I actually wrote my example down.
You can say like Delta one six,

493
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:41,400
we need high ground on the other
side of that road, make it happen.

494
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,030
So then the delta one,
six commander goes, okay,

495
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,370
I need high ground on the other side
of the road, there's a good building.

496
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,380
It looks like that. So we
can take, hey, you know,

497
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,040
squad come with me and they go over and
take down the building. I gave them a, uh,

498
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,520
still gave him commander's intent.
I gave him very clear commander's intent.

499
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,390
I didn't really tell them why. I didn't
say, Hey, what do you think would be best?

500
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,580
Do you think it's a good idea
to get high ground? No. I said,

501
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:04,590
go get high ground on the
other side of the street.

502
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,930
That's what I told them to do.
So I'm going to let them figure it out.

503
00:29:06,931 --> 00:29:08,190
They understand what the intent is.

504
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,130
You could say something a
little bit more specific.

505
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,500
You could give them an actual, an
actual directive. You could say,

506
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,930
Charlie, one six Gig, take two squads,

507
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,850
assault building 34 on the
other side of the road.

508
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,160
Get high ground on the rooftop,
go.

509
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,950
Now we have something that's
more specific. Again, it's
not commander's intent,

510
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:31,760
it's directly I'm telling you what to do
and a lot of times people are going to

511
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,400
want that.

512
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,010
They're going to want to hear exactly
what to do in these pressers situations,

513
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,750
so depending on the level of experience
that your subordinate leadership has,

514
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,230
depends on maybe how specific you're
going to get with just given commander's

515
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:46,570
intent versus giving
something very specific to do.

516
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,190
Both of those are the right answers.

517
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:51,580
If you have a good really good leader
underneath you and you can just give them

518
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,860
the intent and you can let them come
up with a plan, cool. Go with that.

519
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,450
If you've got somebody that
needs a little more guidance,

520
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:56,920
give him a little bit
more specific guidance.

521
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,730
Now obviously,
one part of that is you got to have trust.

522
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,480
You got to have trust with the,

523
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,990
with the subordinate leadership
that you're working with,

524
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:10,870
whether that's you working with your
whole platoon and you just got to trust

525
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:13,540
your, your squad leaders and
your, your fire team leaders.

526
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,240
But you got to build that trust through,

527
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:21,300
through training and
through Harvard Training,

528
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,090
through coaching them and mentoring it.
And again,

529
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:28,020
I hate using the word coaching
and mentoring because that
always gives an air of

530
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:32,490
superiority and I'm not going to want
to come off across as superior to other

531
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:36,450
people. Mm hmm. Why do I not want to
come off as superior to other people?

532
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,760
Well, number one, because it, it
unifies our team more. And number two,

533
00:30:41,761 --> 00:30:44,040
cause I'm not superior to
other people, right? Um,

534
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:46,320
another person and my subordinates,

535
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:49,290
even though they might not have as
much time in rank or experiences me,

536
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,700
they still might have great ideas
and I respect that. So this isn't a,

537
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:54,571
hey,

538
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:57,960
I don't want to use coach
or mentor because I'm
manipulating them and I want to

539
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:58,794
make sure that they,

540
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,100
that they listened to me because I'm
being a certain way with them. No, no.

541
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:06,750
I legitimately respect what they're
saying. That's the difference here.

542
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,050
So,
but that's my goal is to build trust.

543
00:31:10,051 --> 00:31:12,330
And the other way that you build
trust enough said this before,

544
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:16,050
is by giving trust. You know, hey, I
trust that you can do this. Hey Echo,

545
00:31:16,051 --> 00:31:18,310
you're going to go take down a building.
I trust your plan. Come up with it,

546
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:22,260
make it happen. Boom, you could do it.
You trust me more when I trust you,

547
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:22,861
you trust me.

548
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:27,861
And that's what we want to do now when
the operation is over and now you're in a

549
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,430
post operational debrief thing,

550
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,440
you can discuss why you gave a certain
order or you can get feedback from them

551
00:31:36,481 --> 00:31:38,190
on why they executed in a certain way.

552
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:41,220
And you can get the questions going
back and forth and through that little

553
00:31:41,221 --> 00:31:45,990
question and answer period that takes
place during a post operational debrief.

554
00:31:45,991 --> 00:31:47,430
We get to know each other more,

555
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,430
we build more trust and we
become better as a team.

556
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:51,643
Hmm.

557
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,400
So that's the way it works.

558
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,950
You don't always have time to explain
why pressure situations you lead.

559
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:04,670
Yeah. Yeah. That trust
thing is big indeed.

560
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:12,160
Next question. Next question.
I like it. What do we got?

561
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,290
What advice do you have for
those who have weak, poor,

562
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:21,000
or otherwise ineffective leaders?
How do you manipulate that situation?

563
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:22,890
So again,

564
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,480
I think I may have actually
answered this question before

565
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,050
[inaudible], but I'll
answer it again. Sure.

566
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,513
When,

567
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,530
when you are in a situation this,

568
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:43,040
when you got somebody that's weak or
ineffective leader or a poor leader,

569
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,980
the answer's always the same.
Which news you lead,

570
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,960
you lead yourself and I hope people that
listen to podcast, all of the regular,

571
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,900
you all knew what I
was going to say there.

572
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,140
You all know that when
someone is not leading you,

573
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,910
then you lead them.
You pick up the slack for the weakness.

574
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,390
My leader want to come up
with a plan. Cool. I will.

575
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,870
My leader doesn't want to give
a brief. That's fine. I will.

576
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,300
My leader doesn't want to mentor
the younger troops. That's okay.

577
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,410
I will do it.

578
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,060
Leader doesn't want to take the
blame when something goes wrong.

579
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,390
That's fine with me.
I'm going to take the blame

580
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,090
and you think about that one. That one
can be tricky because you think, well,

581
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:34,130
I'm going to look bad in front of the,
in front of the more senior boss.

582
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,770
Now think about it from
the senior bosses position.

583
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:41,070
If if you work for me echo and
the boss comes in and we the,

584
00:33:41,071 --> 00:33:43,250
the mission was a failure and I'm the,

585
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,900
and I'm the guy that's in charge
and I say, sorry boss, we failed.

586
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:52,130
It was echo's fault and echo
goes, hey sir, it was my
fault. Here's what happened,

587
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,560
here's the mistakes I made and here's
what we do to fix it next time.

588
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,880
Who Do you respect more? Yeah, of
course. I'm looking at promoting you.

589
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,400
I actually want to promote you and
our fire myself for being a guy that's

590
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:04,130
passing the buck and passing
responsibility, not taking
ownership of anything.

591
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,180
So imagine what that looks like before
you get all intimidated by taking the

592
00:34:08,181 --> 00:34:10,700
blame for something and think you're going
to look bad and think you're going to

593
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:14,270
get fired. Think about what it looks
like from the senior perspective.

594
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,170
And you actually have to imagine
what it looked like underneath you.

595
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,250
You have to see it from your perspective
cause it's even when you think about

596
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:25,490
their perspective, you still
can be in fear of it. You Think,

597
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,300
oh I'm the guy that's taking the blame.
I'm the one that's going to get fired. No.

598
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:34,850
And am I saying this like blanket that
there's sometimes where if if the boss

599
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:36,050
screw something up really bad,

600
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:41,051
like let's say it was something like
classified information got left out and it

601
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:44,480
was your boss that literally left
it out and you go, no, it was me.

602
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:46,500
Well first of all, you're
not telling the truth. Right?

603
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:50,420
So you're not telling the truth and
the person made a mistake. That's that.

604
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,960
There's no excuse for, yeah. So that's
not a situation that I'm talking about.

605
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,520
And if your boss was the type
of person that said, yes,

606
00:34:58,521 --> 00:35:01,550
I'm going to put the blame on him, I
would burn them alive. But I'd be like,

607
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:04,460
actually, here's what really happened. So

608
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,820
I'm not talking about
that type of situation.

609
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,810
But when you're doing an operational
thing where there's mistakes that get made

610
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:15,080
and your boss is scared to take ownership
of them, take ownership of them,

611
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:21,050
not that you will win in
the long run. Um, now,

612
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:26,530
now here's the part that is crucial and
critical and the most challenging part

613
00:35:28,761 --> 00:35:31,730
of this.
And that is when you step up and lead,

614
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
you want to make sure you weren't
stepping up and stepping on your leader.

615
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,880
You don't want to step into
their little spotlight.

616
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,210
You don't want to impose yourself
in their leadership limelight.

617
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:53,820
And Gloria, you don't want to do
that. You, you, you can't do that.

618
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,560
You want them to get the credit.

619
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:58,890
You don't want to have them be
intimidated by you in any way.

620
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:03,660
And this is hard because when you
start taking ownership for stuff,

621
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,570
it's very, it can be very, um,

622
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,710
intimidating for the person that's
above you because they think, Dang,

623
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:11,311
this guy just,

624
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:14,430
he's just a bold bastard than stepping
up and taking charge of stuff.

625
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,860
And they might get intimidated that.
So,

626
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,470
so what'd you have to do
is you have to do some,

627
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,970
some indirect maneuver warfare here.
And for instance,

628
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
if they don't want to,
if they don't want to come up with a plan,

629
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,250
maybe you start saying, hey
sir, what do you think of this?

630
00:36:29,251 --> 00:36:33,200
Would this be a good plan?
And maybe if you're,

631
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,760
if they're not mentoring the younger
guys, maybe say, Hey, you know what?

632
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:38,610
I want to do this up. I want to spend
some time with the guys after work.

633
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,560
Do you mind if I have a
little session with them?

634
00:36:40,561 --> 00:36:44,160
Kind of go over what we've learned
on last appointment? Or Hey,

635
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,760
about this new regulatory thing that's
come out in the business world and I want

636
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:51,900
to get our younger troops to know it.
Do you mind if I teach a class on that?

637
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,130
So you're, you're asking them permission
and you might even say, you know, hey,

638
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,760
I think it would look really good
for you too if we were doing this.

639
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:04,200
Do you want to make
them look good? Um, and

640
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:09,420
those are the ways that you do that.
You step up and lead,

641
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,240
but make sure you're not stepping
on your leader because that, that,

642
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,300
that could backfire.

643
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,920
And you could end up in a situation
where they feel intimidated and you're

644
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:24,921
getting put in the dog house or fired or
demoted or in trouble because they feel

645
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:29,700
intimidated by you.
So use caution if you have a good leader.

646
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,270
Some leaders just aren't that aggressive
and when you start getting aggressive,

647
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:34,823
they start,

648
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:39,180
they actually like the fact that you're
getting aggressive and they like, I mean,

649
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:41,430
I worked for some people that I love
the fact that I would take a step up and

650
00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:43,170
take charge. They had no problem
with it because they were good,

651
00:37:43,171 --> 00:37:43,861
confident leaders.

652
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:48,150
It's the insecure leader you have to
watch out for the insecure leader that's

653
00:37:48,151 --> 00:37:50,040
worried about looking bad.

654
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,120
And that's another two to change
perspective. Again on this,

655
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,500
when you as a leader have somebody
that's stepping up and taking charge,

656
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,390
as you start feeling intimidated by it,
ask yourself why. It's probably your ego.

657
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,530
You're being a weak leader by being
intimidated by your subordinates.

658
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,330
If you're subordinate is doing your job
at doing it better than you let get step

659
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,820
up and start looking at how can
you go up the chain of command?

660
00:38:14,821 --> 00:38:17,910
How can you look up and out? How,
what other areas can you focus on?

661
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:21,810
Since that leader has stepped up and is
making things happen, that's awesome.

662
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,850
That is awesome. We want that.
That's decentralized command.

663
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,840
That's building other leaders underneath
you, which is what your goal is.

664
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:31,950
A leader should always be,

665
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:40,720
and I'll tell ya, every time I see someone
that goes, oh, I got a weak leader.

666
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:45,460
I'm always like, lucky you. Lucky
you. Take advantage of that.

667
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,250
Take advantage of it.
Do whatever you want.

668
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,910
Do you have such not good opportunity
when you have a weak leader above, you?

669
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,230
Don't look at that.
Don't,

670
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:57,400
don't get all down trodden because they're
going to or just doesn't motivate you.

671
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,660
Awesome. Motivate yourself, get
char, get in charge of things,

672
00:39:01,661 --> 00:39:05,170
take advantage of it. Make things happen.
It's awesome to have a weak leader.

673
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,330
I love it. Get after it. It's good to
give me so much mobility in my, in my,

674
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,160
in my job. Right. I'm so much more
mobility. Then if I've got someone, Hey,

675
00:39:15,161 --> 00:39:16,810
if I've got someone that's as
strong leader, that's great too,

676
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,650
but weak leaders know factor, I'm going to
take advantage of it. Yeah. I feel like,

677
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,963
yes,

678
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,630
you got a weak leader and you're kind of,

679
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,690
you're not stepping up.

680
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,430
You're essentially allowing
that the group, the team,

681
00:39:36,431 --> 00:39:38,870
the objectives to kind of fail in a way.

682
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,640
You're kind of allowing it and then
in a way to, depends on what you do,

683
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:46,570
but in a way you're kind of being like,
hey,

684
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,980
all right. You're allowing the
excuse to be valid. You know where,

685
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:54,310
which kind of makes it invalid really,
when you're like, Hey, I could step up,

686
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,530
but hey, it's the leaders for
as long as it's not my fault.

687
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,990
You know that my leader is
not that good. You know? It's,

688
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,140
you're really not taking much ownership.
Yeah.

689
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,660
You just point your finger at your
leader and say, this is a weak leader.

690
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:08,710
That's not what we do here.
Not what we do at all.

691
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:11,290
And the end of the Times
where I've had weak leaders,

692
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,040
I always took advantage of it.
Like I said one time,

693
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,320
and I've talked about this on the
podcast before we fired our leader. No,

694
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,070
we had a little mutiny that
only happened once for me.

695
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,940
But it happens that,
I mean I obviously,

696
00:40:24,941 --> 00:40:27,070
I don't know all the details of that,

697
00:40:27,071 --> 00:40:30,520
but in a way isn't that you just
stepping up and making it happen.

698
00:40:30,521 --> 00:40:34,520
I mean that's really the basic
impending result. Like Dang, that's,

699
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:38,850
that's kind of where we're
going to arrive. That really
given us stepping up. If,

700
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,350
if that's how it goes down. That's
how it goes down. But you stepped up,

701
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,780
you solve the problem, they're the
problem then that was a problem.

702
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:48,250
There's your solution. Yes. Up
and down the chain of command.

703
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,170
You got to own it.
Yeah, for sure. Alright.

704
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:57,290
Jocko Exhibition Jocko.
Hmm.

705
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,830
Did you do anything ritualistically

706
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,460
to get yourself mentally prepared?

707
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,600
Focused and in the proper mindset?

708
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:13,300
So just before carrying out a mission
such as self talk music or other actions,

709
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,090
you know,

710
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:19,090
get yourself revved up pre operation
preparedness for the mental state.

711
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,370
So
people ask this and it's,

712
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:27,500
and it actually sounds like a
pretty cool question, right?

713
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,250
I mean it sounds like a
pretty cool question. I'm
sure people walk through that.

714
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:34,130
Um,
it's a lot of times because you

715
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,130
think seals and soldiers and marines must
have some kind of deep and incredibly

716
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:47,310
meaningful borderline religious ceremony
that they go to and through in order to

717
00:41:48,911 --> 00:41:52,120
prepare their mind.
Ver Combat.

718
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,650
Maybe it's a,

719
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:00,580
maybe it's a meditation on the warrior
code or maybe it's an aggressive song to

720
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:05,870
peak your adrenaline.
Maybe it's a,

721
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,370
a breathing exercise.

722
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,300
We got a special breathing exercise that's
going to heighten my mental awareness

723
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:16,301
and there's even seals and I use that
term loosely that have written books on

724
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:21,690
that subject of, you know, this,

725
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:26,770
this warrior mindset and the navy
seal breathing techniques and the,

726
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,620
the visualization and things like that.

727
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:34,943
No,

728
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:41,460
I hate to spoil the romantic vision of the

729
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:47,130
mindful warrior poet,
but that actually,

730
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:53,600
that idea just, it does not what
happens and here's the reality.

731
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,210
Um,
first and foremost,

732
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,070
when you are in combat and you're
preparing for an operation,

733
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,960
you are freaking busy. You
are busy. You are planning,

734
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,780
you're doing coordination, you're doing
gear prep, you're doing briefings,

735
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,810
you're making all these adjustments and
changes to everything that's happening.

736
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,630
You don't eat.
We are scrambling around.

737
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,890
I was talking to laugh the
other day and there was a,

738
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,380
most of the time if we were going on,
on in the field on an operation,

739
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,050
we wouldn't be sleeping for 24 hours
before we went in the field. You know,

740
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,320
maybe we'd get two or three hours,

741
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:31,790
but it was a sleep deprivation before
we went in the field because of all the

742
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,590
planning and preparation
that needed to be done,

743
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,920
especially on the big operations
with battalion sized or,

744
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,140
or brigade sized operations.

745
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,100
There's so much planning and preparation
that needs to be done that you don't

746
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:44,510
have.
You're not just,

747
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,820
you're not just sitting around figuring
out what kind of mental prep you're

748
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:53,120
going to do. There's just last
minute detail. There's a phone call,

749
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:55,170
you got a place to higher
headquarters. There's a, uh,

750
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,860
a Deacon Fishkin document that
you got to prepare. You've got to,

751
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:02,480
you got to get stuff done.
So taking some,

752
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,580
some kind of meditative moments
to get in the right mindset.

753
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,640
It's just not happening. You just don't
have the time for it. Now that being said,

754
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,270
mindset, it is a part of combat, right?

755
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:24,650
And so how did I get in
the right mission mindset?

756
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,060
Well,

757
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:31,060
the mindset is not achieved in the
minutes or even hours before an operation

758
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,210
from,
you know,

759
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,590
chanting a mantra or
breathing or meditation or
listening to some song that's

760
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:42,090
going to get you in touch
with your warrior spirit.

761
00:44:42,590 --> 00:44:47,590
The mindset is achieved in the the weeks
and the months and the years before

762
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:55,770
that specific operation commends us.
That's another thing that the,

763
00:44:55,850 --> 00:45:00,330
the idea from that actually I was raised
on in the 90s in the seal teams was

764
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,160
like,
you are going to do a mission.

765
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,940
We used to joke about it
called the big Mish, right?

766
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,140
The big mission was going to come and
was going to be one mission, right?

767
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,120
And you could get, Hey,
we're going to plan for it.

768
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:14,850
We're going to plan for it for weeks,
maybe even months,

769
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:17,730
and we're going to be able to visualize
everything. And we'd have all this time,

770
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,950
but reality is overseas. You
don't. Since the war started, man,

771
00:45:20,951 --> 00:45:23,260
you're doing an operation every night.
You're going out, you've got another week.

772
00:45:23,261 --> 00:45:24,360
Come back.
You're planning for that one.

773
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,610
When that one gets canceled
for whatever reason,

774
00:45:26,611 --> 00:45:28,470
there's two more that you're playing
in four and you're running out to grab

775
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,530
intelligence, your meet with somebody
else. It's just constantly ongoing,

776
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,380
so we weren't ever preparing for
one mission. We were planning,

777
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,410
we were preparing for mission after
mission. We'd have five, six, seven,

778
00:45:37,411 --> 00:45:42,411
10 we'd have 10 operations in the hopper
at any given time that we're planning

779
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:45,900
and preparing for. We're gathering
intelligence for, we're setting up,

780
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:48,720
we're doing route studies for four or
five different operations at one time.

781
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,700
Then finally one rise to the occasion.
Boom.

782
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:52,800
We're going to go hit that one the next
night, and another one's up to the top.

783
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:55,740
We're going to go hit
that one. Okay, so again,

784
00:45:55,741 --> 00:45:58,340
this idea that I think came
from the nineties of, Hey,

785
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,280
we're going to do the big mish.
Yeah,

786
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,570
we're going to have to get into mental
mindset. No, we lived in a mental mindset,

787
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,850
but that mindset came from the
training that we went through.

788
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:11,030
The grueling training through the
repetition of the fundamental skill sets.

789
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:18,300
The mindset comes from the discipline,
from waking up early,

790
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,790
from studying tactics,

791
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:23,460
from understanding the enemy,

792
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,400
from all those,

793
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:28,950
yeah.

794
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:31,410
Unmitigated daily disciplines.

795
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:35,340
That's where the mindset
comes with it comes from,

796
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:38,490
and I'll tell you on top of that,
on top of that,

797
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,020
you have to come to grip with some
pretty horrific potential outcomes,

798
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:48,090
right.

799
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:53,090
You have to accept some
solemn possibilities like
that you might be severely

800
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,590
wounded or that you might be killed.

801
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,630
And you also have to
think that about the guys.

802
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,460
You're your friends.

803
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:10,110
That is a nother possibility
that you have to think about.

804
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,480
But for yourself,
you know,

805
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:14,840
okay,

806
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,060
you have to accept that possibility.

807
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,120
You have to accept that potential outcome
that you could die and you have to

808
00:47:22,761 --> 00:47:25,460
accept that now you don't want it.

809
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,080
Yeah,

810
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,770
of course you want to live,
but you have to accept the fact

811
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,020
that in the game,

812
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,330
the game of combat,
you could very well die.

813
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:41,350
And I do that

814
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,430
and I was okay with it.
But,

815
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:49,720
but I had come to that conclusion a long
time before whatever operation I was

816
00:47:49,721 --> 00:47:54,721
getting to roll out on one particular
night during a six month long deployment.

817
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,113
Hmm.

818
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:01,260
So the mindset is built over time and
like knowledge that you have the mindset,

819
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:10,201
it becomes so ingrained that knowledge
becomes so ingrained that you don't have

820
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:14,290
to cram for it.
Like you'd cram for a final exam.

821
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:17,080
You don't have to cram for the
test to combat in the last minute.

822
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,260
You already know you
already have the confidence,

823
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:25,360
you know you've done everything
possible to prepare mentally to prepare

824
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,160
physically to prepare emotionally.

825
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,350
Okay.

826
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:34,350
And then when the call comes and you
put on your cammies and you fill up your

827
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:39,580
canteens and you put on your helmet
and you lock down your night vision,

828
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,770
you lock and load your
weapon to roll out the gate.

829
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,223
You're ready.

830
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,310
You ever seen the movie gone
in 60 seconds, smell living?

831
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,330
No movies that you've
seen written on a stature.

832
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,210
There's a part where there a button there,

833
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:03,680
their car jackers team of car thieves.

834
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,880
They got to do this mission to save the
brother. You know, they're all retired.

835
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:11,480
That's why I said, but they got to do this
one last mission. So it'd be big Mesh.

836
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,430
The big miss you have. Exactly. So they
go through with it and get into a mindset.

837
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:15,740
So check it out.

838
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,770
Imagine if in the movie they were
doing that mission every single night.

839
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,010
I'm not going through that drill every
night because they know they prepared,

840
00:49:22,011 --> 00:49:24,140
they know they've got their mind right
and they're gonna go out and execute the

841
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:28,790
operation. That's the difference. Or
maybe they would do it every night.

842
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:32,840
This is what they do. All right, let's
hear it. Paint, put it on low rider.

843
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:33,943
You know the song.

844
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,020
Yeah.

845
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,310
[inaudible] then they just
kind of listened to it and
then they go super subtle.

846
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,250
Yeah. Maybe check it out. Yeah.
You know, some guys, you know,

847
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:48,880
crank up a song. You know, we had
speaker, we actually had speakers outside.

848
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,270
Sometimes the guys would be blasting
some music, but it wasn't old,

849
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,590
like a ritualistic thing
where we all sat there,

850
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:56,980
closed her eyes and listen to the same
song at the same time meet. Yeah. Yeah.

851
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,050
Well yeah, I mean, and you know what,

852
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,880
I was always either what my two combat
deployments, I was a platoon commander,

853
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:07,780
I was task in your commander so,
well I was busy. You know, I was,

854
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:11,830
all that planning stuff that I'm talking
about was, was me. If I was going out,

855
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,530
if I wasn't going out then I wasn't doing
anything ritualistically to get ready

856
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:18,640
to go out. Um, but you're busy.

857
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:20,860
People don't understand
how busy you are in combat,

858
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:24,610
not just while you're on the battlefield,
but when you're back in the rear, uh,

859
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,040
preparing to go or preparing or
planning for operations. Yeah,

860
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,920
I would imagine some people, you
know, cause even list them all.

861
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:34,670
I mean really how deep, how far do you
want to stretch the word? Like ritual,

862
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:39,070
right. So that I'm sure some people
would write maybe like, like I said, kid,

863
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:41,480
like a lucky thing or I don't
know if you keep the carried lots.

864
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,060
Now you're getting a different realm here.
You're talking about superstition.

865
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:48,560
Well you're also talking about, so I had
certain patterns that I followed, right?

866
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:53,480
Yeah. Those patterns were
not for my mental state. They
were to be prepared. Right.

867
00:50:53,481 --> 00:50:54,231
But it's kind of,
you know,

868
00:50:54,231 --> 00:50:57,110
I've talked about how I had to caught
filled with my gear and when I put all

869
00:50:57,111 --> 00:51:00,220
that gear on I was ready.
Right. That's, that's, that's,

870
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,020
and I put the gear on the same way every
time because you're going through a

871
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:05,120
process and a procedure so that you
make sure you get everything right.

872
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,830
Even when I'm coming to the record,
the podcast,

873
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:09,890
I do the same thing every
time I get this ready,

874
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:14,000
I get that ready to print this stuff
out. I, you know, I bring the same pens,

875
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:14,930
the same stupid pens.

876
00:51:14,931 --> 00:51:17,060
I bring them all the time cause I
have a pattern that I go through set.

877
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:19,170
I'm ready for what we're going to do.

878
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,210
That's a standard operating procedure
to be ready for the operation.

879
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:28,580
Whether it gets me to mental state.
Yeah, I guess it does. Good Mental Stan.

880
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:33,110
Technically that is a ritual then
I guess on Boston. No, no, no, no.

881
00:51:33,111 --> 00:51:35,450
You're the man of course.
For sure. Up Busted. But no,

882
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:40,340
I think I am in Boston because that is
definitely a ritualistic thing to go

883
00:51:40,341 --> 00:51:44,690
through. And if I talk about,
uh, being in combat, sure.

884
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,450
Where you're getting your gear on,
you're [inaudible], you know, you're,

885
00:51:47,451 --> 00:51:50,570
you're programming your radio, you're
getting radio check theirs. But again,

886
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,200
the reason it doesn't really hit me as
a ritualistic thing because those are,

887
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:59,510
those are standard procedures that
you're going to prepare for the mission.

888
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,300
You're not there physical
things that have to be done.

889
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,580
They're not for mental preparation.
Now does your mind no. What's coming?

890
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,270
Yes. And I'll tell you a classic example
is when you put down your night vision,

891
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,680
which for those of you
who don't understand this,

892
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:14,570
we have a helmet on and you
have night vision on it.

893
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:17,750
It can flip up where you're just
looking for your regular eyes.

894
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:20,390
But then when you black out the vehicles
and your flip your night vision down,

895
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,800
you're in a different world.

896
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:26,000
You're in a green world of darkness
where you know what's about to,

897
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:29,600
you're about to do.
So whenever I flip my night vision down,

898
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:34,970
he would always give me a a sensation.
Again, it wasn't this is preparing me.

899
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,720
I knew that it was time. Right. There's a
difference. There's a subtle difference.

900
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,570
No difference, no there. I'm sure
there is a different, but there's some,

901
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:45,320
there's overlap there. Where I
think that is, I mean, like I said,

902
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:48,260
it depends how loose you want to use
the word ritual, but technically yet,

903
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,030
like remember you said one time,

904
00:52:50,031 --> 00:52:52,070
he said something about
before you guys rolled out.

905
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:56,180
Everyone starts there in the
same time ritual and ritual,

906
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,900
however, standard operating
procedures, it's a functional thing.

907
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:04,430
Like you've got to put your night vision
goggles down. You have to do that. You,

908
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,220
it's what you're going to
do and when you do that,

909
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,320
because you've done it a hundred times
before, you know that that's now game on.

910
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:16,070
But if, if you're just putting
your night vision goggles done,

911
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,200
that's not really the ritual.
But if it's like,

912
00:53:18,201 --> 00:53:22,160
I'm going to put my night vision goggles
down after I do this every single time,

913
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,130
that's a ritual. Or we all do it
together. Like when it's, you're calling

914
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,990
it a ritual, you're putting a, you're
putting a ritualistic flavor to it.

915
00:53:30,991 --> 00:53:33,680
It's a standard operating procedure.
They can be processed.

916
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:38,790
But I'm saying it's not
ritualistic because there was no,

917
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:39,893
um,

918
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,340
embedded deeper meaning that
was put on top of it purposely.

919
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,490
Very ceremonial.
We're trying to make it,

920
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:49,440
we're trying to make it in
someone's not right. Right.

921
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,300
Do you follow the same standard
operating procedures? Yes. So you and,

922
00:53:54,301 --> 00:53:55,950
and you know, when we talk
about fighters, you know,

923
00:53:55,951 --> 00:53:57,320
I've been with a lot of fighters and,

924
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,740
and coached him and those guys have
little ritualistic things to get.

925
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,060
Sometimes it is music,
right?

926
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,830
Because they're going to go fight a
five minute round and they're going to

927
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:05,880
listen to something or they're going to,

928
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:08,340
they're going to sit there and close their
eyes and think about what's important

929
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:12,690
to them. That's fine. I'm
telling you, when I was overseas,

930
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,840
I didn't have time to do any of that.
We were running around.

931
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:19,170
Never once did I say standby,
Hey,

932
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:22,830
no one talked to me for the next three
minutes while I get in the zone. Yeah, no,

933
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,130
I was in the zone because I
spent my, you know, did a workup,

934
00:54:26,131 --> 00:54:30,480
did spent my time in the
teams, went through training,
you know, shot my gun, knew,

935
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:33,600
knew what I was doing and so I
didn't need to get in the zone.

936
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,380
And I think that's what I think.
That's why I think I'm sensitive to this.

937
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,570
And here's why I think
I'm sensitive to this.

938
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,410
I think I'm sensitive to this
because I think people try and,

939
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:44,700
and tell,

940
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:49,440
tell people or sell people on the
fact that if you do these things,

941
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:53,700
it will prepare you mentally for,
you know,

942
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,540
a pressure situation.
And that's what bothers me about it.

943
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:02,370
That's what bothers me about
it is, hey, if you do this,
if you, this is what it is.

944
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:04,680
If you take this shortcut,

945
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:10,140
then you will be prepared.
Because I would never tell someone,

946
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,620
oh, you want to fight an MMA fight?
You're going to get in the cage. Cool.

947
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,610
Here's what you need to do to train for
that three minutes before you enter the

948
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:19,560
cage,
go into his room,

949
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,020
shut your eyes and think about
how you're going to win the fight.

950
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,910
That is not true. Now this is, I
guess this is where you've just,

951
00:55:26,911 --> 00:55:30,390
you've just gotten this out of me. Echo
you took me to, to, to my point that I,

952
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,770
that I believe in, right? That is
not what prepares you for the fight.

953
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,630
What prepares you for the fight is the
years and years of training that you've

954
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:41,850
done to get there.
The last three minutes.

955
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,520
You can have a ritual and it can
put your mind in the right place,

956
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,310
but that's not what's putting
your riding in the right place.

957
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:50,640
And what's putting your mind in the
right place is the months and months and

958
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,520
years of training. Same thing with on
the battlefield. If someone said, hey,

959
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:55,490
I'm about to go execute a,
uh,

960
00:55:56,020 --> 00:56:00,870
a direct action mission and what should
I do to prepare for that? I wouldn't say,

961
00:56:00,871 --> 00:56:05,730
well, what you need to do is listen
to your favorite an odor head song.

962
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,270
No, that is not going to help you. What
you need to do is you need to do this,

963
00:56:09,271 --> 00:56:12,450
you need to go this shooting. You need
to work on these types of tactics.

964
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:14,180
You need to understand what to
do when someone gets wounded.

965
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:16,640
You need to have standard operating
procedures for how to go into an out of

966
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:19,320
buildings. You need to understand
how to clear rooms with open doors,

967
00:56:19,321 --> 00:56:21,030
closed doors,
corner fed rooms,

968
00:56:21,031 --> 00:56:23,050
all of these different things
that you need to know. You know,

969
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,970
I would tell you all of that stuff, but
what I don't like is when someone says,

970
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,490
oh, what you need to do
to be ready is do these,

971
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,280
do this last fraction of a thing,

972
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,260
and that's what's going to prepare
you for combat. No, not true. Yeah.

973
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:40,360
What prepares you for combat?
What prepares you for a fight?

974
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,460
What prepares you for a
tough business decision?

975
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,060
What prepares you for a pressure scenario
that you're going into isn't the three

976
00:56:46,061 --> 00:56:49,450
minutes before?
That's the icing on the cake.

977
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,070
So I don't want to focus on that.

978
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,900
I want to focus on the daily disciplines
for months and weeks and years.

979
00:56:55,901 --> 00:57:00,070
That led you up to the point so that
when I went in combat for the first time

980
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,920
and, and, and shot my
gun for the first time,

981
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:05,650
it wasn't about the
song that I listened to.

982
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,930
It wasn't about the briefing that I did.

983
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:10,570
It was the discipline and the
training that got me there.

984
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:14,260
So maybe I was a little bit hard
coming out of the gate on this idea,

985
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,310
but that's what,

986
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,540
that's why it was hard and I didn't really
understand that in my own mind until

987
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,990
you started bleeding me down this
road because that stuff does,

988
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,870
when I see somebody trying to sell
that, I don't like that. Yeah,

989
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:28,330
I don't like that. Do I have rituals? Yes.

990
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:31,330
I absolutely do not even have rituals
for when I get up in the morning and what

991
00:57:31,331 --> 00:57:33,520
I do. You know, I, I fill my water bottle,

992
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,940
my water bottle every night when I go
to bed and he's in the same spot when I

993
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:40,550
get up out of bed in the morning, my water
bottles there, I put my, you know, I,

994
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:42,970
I'd go very quietly in the
bathroom and we talk about this.

995
00:57:42,971 --> 00:57:45,460
I do what I gotta do in there.
I come out, I grabbed it's dark,

996
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,320
I grabbed my water bottle.
It's already where I know it's gonna be.

997
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:50,530
I need you to turn on any
lights. It's where it's
supposed to be. That's a ritual.

998
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:52,930
I go to the kitchen,
it's dark in the kitchen.

999
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,710
I fill up the water bottle by sound
cause you know how this little beautiful

1000
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,900
sound as it fills up, it gets higher
and higher and higher and then boom,

1001
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:02,410
you kill it. Now I walk out, I flip
on a light in the back of the house,

1002
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,560
put the shoes on because
I'm not bothering anyone.

1003
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,320
So there's a little ritual there.
When I walk up to the gym,

1004
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,240
plugging the music and now it's time to
get after it. So there's a ritual there.

1005
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:15,850
There's, there's, even when I
go to the gym and do Jujitsu,

1006
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:19,870
I have a little ritual that I follow.
There I go, man. I taped the fingers.

1007
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,650
I do what I gotta do for those youth
people that are going to ask. I taped the,

1008
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:27,270
the, the two fingers on my
right hand, my pinky and my,

1009
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,910
and my ring finger on my right hand
because my pinkies has got a little judo

1010
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:33,280
finger. Right. So I, I
taped those two together.

1011
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,550
It also gives me a little bit of
that friction on the guillotine.

1012
00:58:36,551 --> 00:58:39,820
At least that's what I've told Echo to
further intimidate and scare him of the

1013
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:44,410
GT. So there's some little
ritualistic things there.

1014
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,090
If Dean's there,

1015
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:51,070
when I'll go in the sauna for five minutes
and just get a little bit warm before

1016
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:52,510
he,
and he sees me sweating.

1017
00:58:52,511 --> 00:58:56,320
He doesn't like to see me sweating cause
he knows that, that I'm, it's on, it's on,

1018
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:56,861
right.

1019
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:59,860
So I'll go in there just to send a little
mental vibe to Dean that you know what

1020
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:01,780
Jack was already sweating. He says, Damn.

1021
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,120
So those ritualistic things,
those are the fraction,

1022
00:59:07,121 --> 00:59:11,290
the tiniest part of what you need
to do to prepare the preparation.

1023
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,440
The mindset doesn't come from
those things. You want to,

1024
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:18,460
you want to close out that final bit and
make it something ritualistic that gets

1025
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:22,040
you in the right mindset. Do
it. But that not where the money

1026
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,990
is made,
the money is made in the,

1027
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:28,220
everything that leads up to those final
three minutes or two minutes or five

1028
00:59:28,221 --> 00:59:33,221
minutes of ritualistic behavior that you
have to get you ready to rock and roll.

1029
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:38,450
So bring it.
What can we extrapolate there?

1030
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:40,850
So the question is no really,

1031
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,340
I mean you maintained really cause
the question is do you do anything

1032
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:46,810
ritualistically to get yourself mentally
prepared? Focus and proper mindsets.

1033
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,290
So you don't, but you do do things that
are rituals. But that's not the question.

1034
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:51,980
This is one of the question.

1035
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:56,360
So you're the rituals you're
talking about in regards to,

1036
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,860
Oh yeah, Richard is, do I have,
what rituals did I have in, in, in,

1037
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:05,180
in preparing for combat, training
my ass off, being prepared,

1038
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,290
studying the enemy, being in crop,
physical condition, those, the rituals,

1039
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,060
the rituals are the training
and the rituals that, like
I said, for the 20th time,

1040
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:17,360
that little tiny thing, those are
just standard operating procedures.

1041
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,310
And when you do those ritualistically,
then you're then you number one,

1042
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:25,580
you won't forget anything.
You'll know that you have all your gear,

1043
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,780
you'll know that you've done what you're
supposed to do and when you put your

1044
01:00:29,781 --> 01:00:34,270
night vision goggles down, you'll know
that it's on the straight and you'll be,

1045
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,510
men are mentally prepared.

1046
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:41,050
So your standard operating procedures
are rituals by technicality.

1047
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:46,880
Sure, sure. There you though,

1048
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,190
if for those of you that aren't
watching this on youtube,

1049
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:53,360
echo just looked extremely proud of the,
of the statement right there.

1050
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:59,100
I wasn't malady. They are, I'm proud.
I'm proud that I had some influence.

1051
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:05,120
I don't want to completely beat
a dead horse. Um, because, but,

1052
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:10,121
but what bothers me about that idea is
people thinking they can cut corners on

1053
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:13,400
the preparation. You can't
cut corners. That's my point.

1054
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:17,300
You can't cut corners and think you're
going to get the three minute preparation

1055
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:19,070
to be ready for combat,
to be ready for battle for,

1056
01:01:19,071 --> 01:01:22,190
you'll be ready for a pressure situation
to be ready for a tough business

1057
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:24,980
decision. You don't get ready
for that in three minutes.

1058
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:29,780
You get ready for that for months and
years. That's how you prepare for it, bro.

1059
01:01:29,781 --> 01:01:32,900
I was, I used to play football
at Uah and we had this,

1060
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:37,670
I don't know if you're watching like
football Bragg. No, I'm not. No,

1061
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:39,620
I'm not laying down the set.
We already knew that though.

1062
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:43,190
Anyway,

1063
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,120
so I was a wide receiver and for the
drill wide receiver I was a lot smaller

1064
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:51,830
back then. I was like one 81
85, whatever. Nonetheless,

1065
01:01:51,831 --> 01:01:55,550
one of the drills was this, um, if you
know football camp, you'll know this.

1066
01:01:55,551 --> 01:02:00,551
It's like it's a motor on a big tripod
and on the motor or the spinning tires

1067
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,600
and they spin this way is too,
there's three of them.

1068
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:08,210
So this they go on this
weird skewed angle.

1069
01:02:08,211 --> 01:02:12,530
So basically you load a football from
the back and you push it through and it

1070
01:02:12,531 --> 01:02:15,920
shoots the ball like, yeah. And there's
different speeds and stuff like that.

1071
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:20,250
So uh, my coach, what was
his name, put you miles

1072
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:23,790
my, I forget if that was his first
name or last name. Anyway, coach miles,

1073
01:02:23,791 --> 01:02:28,320
he wasn't very nice coach so
he would like drill us with it.

1074
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:32,680
Right. Which is fine. That part is
cool cause it's training. But the,

1075
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:36,720
the part that I didn't think was very
cool was if you missed like there was,

1076
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:39,300
you would pay a price.
Like he would yell at you,

1077
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:42,630
he'd sometimes he'd make you run it.
Like if you missed,

1078
01:02:42,631 --> 01:02:46,230
it wasn't like it was like, to
me the punishment, it was wrong.

1079
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:49,560
Like the system was wrong,
their punishment didn't
fit the crime well. Yeah.

1080
01:02:49,561 --> 01:02:53,040
It wasn't like this isn't going to make
you better to put more pressure on this

1081
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:57,480
drill. You know, it was more like, Hey,
look, eh, but he wants to cause stress.

1082
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,070
Okay. Okay, good, good. I didn't feel
that at the time. And now, I mean,

1083
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:03,030
I'd have to think about it more.

1084
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,600
I haven't thought about
it and write your essays.

1085
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,560
Your viewpoint would be different
maybe, but maybe not though. No, no,

1086
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:09,181
I don't think so.

1087
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:12,090
Only because I think that you're trying
to get the best out of these people.

1088
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,280
You know,
for a specific game day,

1089
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:18,720
there's been a lot of pressure and you
can actually get used to that stress by

1090
01:03:18,721 --> 01:03:21,330
inoculating yourself to it by him saying,
look,

1091
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:23,190
you've got to catch this ball or
you're going to pay the man. Yeah.

1092
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:26,110
Or just get better at
catching so you can know.

1093
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:29,340
So you could focus on getting better at
taking stress or get getting better at

1094
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:30,174
catching.
Okay.

1095
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:34,410
We'll give you focusing now what I would
say is that he should have combined

1096
01:03:34,411 --> 01:03:37,650
both of them and he should have given
you guys ample time to just practice the

1097
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:42,360
coaching part and then later distress.
That would've been great if he did that.

1098
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:47,250
In fact is he did nuts. So back to the
ritual, mental preparation, whatever.

1099
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,220
So thou,
it would be stressful for me as a young,

1100
01:03:50,221 --> 01:03:53,340
I was like 17 when I started
footballs, you know, late anyway.

1101
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:55,830
So I'm like one of the
young guys and heat.

1102
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:59,910
And so when he do stuff like to make
it harder and harder and harder.

1103
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:01,080
So of course you're gonna Miss.

1104
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,810
So there's this one where he's like ball
and then you know you're supposed to

1105
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,770
turn it on the balls on its way,
full speed.

1106
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:09,630
Things like in thing
comes real hard anyway.

1107
01:04:09,631 --> 01:04:12,960
So you'd miss and then he'd get on
that. So anyway, I'm stressed now.

1108
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,990
It was not every practice I'm going to
and stress about that one drill that

1109
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:20,820
we're going to do. So before
practice we had this cool, real,

1110
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,140
real nice facility.

1111
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,110
There's this lounge where I want to just
kind of cruise and mellow out cause he

1112
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:25,680
goes,
you know,

1113
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:30,150
from class to pre-practice
prep and then some meetings.

1114
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,230
And then practice is a little bit of
downtime where you can mellow out in the

1115
01:04:33,231 --> 01:04:36,120
lunch. So in the lounge, I'd close my
eyes a lot of the time and be like,

1116
01:04:36,121 --> 01:04:40,750
just visualize that ball only for the
drill. Not In scrimmage time screaming.

1117
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,580
I have no problem, but I'm visual,
I'm mentally preparing for the drill.

1118
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,700
It just doesn't seem right anyway.
So yeah,

1119
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:51,543
mentally,

1120
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:56,310
mentally visualizing the ball coming
at crazy speeds and I'm catching him,

1121
01:04:56,311 --> 01:04:58,890
pull him, catch him off my
in my little visualization.

1122
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:04,920
So I go and as time went on,
I kept doing that over and over and over.

1123
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:09,660
Didn't help to drill at all.
Full failed.

1124
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:14,070
Like as far as any kind of effect, I
would catch some miss, some get yelled at,

1125
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:18,100
more stress next to him, even worse.
Same thing. So I, I would say this, first

1126
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:20,310
of all,
visualization of uh,

1127
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:24,820
a physical technique is proven to
help. So it didn't help. In your case,

1128
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:29,110
what I would have said would have been
the most helpful for you is to say,

1129
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:31,690
you know what? I don't care
what this guy does to me. Yeah.

1130
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,510
I don't care if I miss this ball.
Mama, go out there and have fun. Yeah.

1131
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:36,850
You want me to do?
It's not going to act like a maniac.

1132
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,980
I'm going to have such a good
time running down the field.

1133
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,940
I know what he calls ball.

1134
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:43,030
I'm going to turn around and do my best
to grab that thing. If I don't grab it,

1135
01:05:43,031 --> 01:05:47,170
I'm going to do 14 somersaults and I'm
going to have a good time and so that

1136
01:05:47,171 --> 01:05:47,550
would you,

1137
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,870
you're taking the pressure off yourself
because that's probably what was what

1138
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:53,900
was a GM and you up this
you'd like to say it.

1139
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,490
I don't say this to back
to this whole idea, right?

1140
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,370
Another thing that that I,

1141
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:05,700
that I feel this sort of allergy to this
type of thing is it's sort of like a,

1142
01:06:06,131 --> 01:06:10,370
on the Tim Ferris episode where
I was just answering questions,

1143
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:14,870
I'm going to ask about motivation and
I said like, look, motivation isn't,

1144
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,120
isn't your friend, right?
Motivations going to go up and down.

1145
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,780
I feel like you know what's going to
be good is discipline, discipline.

1146
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,670
And so there's really,

1147
01:06:22,671 --> 01:06:25,790
that's the difference between what I'm
talking about here when we're talking

1148
01:06:25,791 --> 01:06:29,240
about, hey, what do you do to get into
mindset? Well that's really talking about,

1149
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:31,280
you know, your mental
mindset of motivation. No,

1150
01:06:31,281 --> 01:06:33,440
but what I'm talking about is discipline,

1151
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:38,441
standard operating procedures
that actually prepare you
for what you're about to

1152
01:06:39,051 --> 01:06:39,500
do.

1153
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,820
Not that motivate you temporarily by
listening to a good song or by doing some

1154
01:06:43,821 --> 01:06:46,160
breathing drill that gets you mentally.
But no,

1155
01:06:46,161 --> 01:06:50,960
the discipline is what's going to make
you mentally prepared for what's about to

1156
01:06:50,961 --> 01:06:53,000
happen. So again, that's why I think I'm,

1157
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:57,320
I'm a little bit stuck in a mud on this
one and I'm trying to have an open mind,

1158
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,630
but I think those are the
key components for me.

1159
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:04,350
I don't like when people try and sell
shortcuts on stuff and make it, you know,

1160
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:07,640
hey, you'll be great if you do these
three minutes. No, actually you won't.

1161
01:07:07,641 --> 01:07:10,320
You need to do everything else.
You need to do the hard work. Yeah.

1162
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,070
And people buy into that. Why did they
buy into that? Because they want to take,

1163
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,140
everyone wants the quick and easy,
you know,

1164
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:17,860
I mean people that listen to
this podcast don't. Yeah. Right.

1165
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:22,280
And the people that are here, we want
to get in the game fully. Two hours.

1166
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:26,030
Two hours in a book. Yes. Yeah.
No shortcuts. No shortcuts.

1167
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,150
So I think that's the
difference is people,

1168
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:33,320
some people sell that and there's too
many people that buy into it when what

1169
01:07:33,321 --> 01:07:38,321
they should be buying is hey hard work
and dedication and discipline is what's

1170
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:43,790
going to mentally prepare me. Not
this other stuff. Yeah. At the end.

1171
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:48,680
Yeah. So yeah. So really like I said, the
sop bite by technicality, it's a ritual.

1172
01:07:48,681 --> 01:07:53,420
But here's the thing about it being only
technically or ritual because if you

1173
01:07:53,421 --> 01:07:54,254
take that away,

1174
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:55,860
okay.

1175
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:59,590
Not necessarily the SLP cause that has
a full on function. You know what to,

1176
01:08:00,030 --> 01:08:02,190
I hate to cut you off just
to talk about what we just,

1177
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:03,150
what we're talking about here.
Right.

1178
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,580
Cause cause I said hey with the
podcast and I've said this before,

1179
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:10,350
we have a ritual that I do. I, you do
it too. When I come, I brew the tea,

1180
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,790
I'm gonna put my hat, my pens, and I do
the folder, I print the stuff out. I have,

1181
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:17,330
I put, put the knives in the bag.
I have a ritual that I go through,

1182
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:20,390
but to case in point,
case in point,

1183
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:23,660
that is not what prepares
me for the episode.

1184
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,160
That is not what prepares
me for the recording.

1185
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:30,140
What prepares me for the recording is
what w is spending 10 hours, 12 hours,

1186
01:08:30,141 --> 01:08:33,860
15 hours diving into a book,
looking up words. I don't know,

1187
01:08:33,861 --> 01:08:37,370
doing background studies on battles that
I don't understand that are mentioned

1188
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:41,660
offhand, researching some general that
gets mentioned. That's what prepares me.

1189
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,410
That's what gets me in the mindset
to record a podcast, not the ritual.

1190
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:50,560
The ritual doesn't actually mean anything
without that core deep preparation

1191
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:56,080
that's done. And that kind of
settles our point here. Yeah,

1192
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:58,160
I by no mean very nicely.

1193
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,220
Yeah, I was going straight
technical. And you,

1194
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:06,490
I think you're absolutely correct.
And sometimes because I would fall like,

1195
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,400
especially when you're young and you're
like, just anything that'll help me,

1196
01:09:09,401 --> 01:09:12,370
you know, like do I, did I tie
my shoes in the wrong, you know,

1197
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:14,380
like superstition goes in
there. You don't, you know,

1198
01:09:14,381 --> 01:09:17,290
that feeling where you're like, Dang,
you just stressed about something.

1199
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,890
So anything that'll help. And then after
a while you kind of go to yourself, man,

1200
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,380
it doesn't matter what order
I put my shoes on right now.

1201
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:26,380
It doesn't matter what color my
socks are, you know, you know, man,

1202
01:09:26,381 --> 01:09:30,700
I used to have this thing where I'd be
stressed to go to school for whatever it

1203
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:32,710
is. Like intermediate skin.
When you're like a news glue,

1204
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,420
it's just a little bit stressed,
not full on,

1205
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,100
but still is looking for a little thing.

1206
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,950
So it's this weird even thinking
about her in a so weird. Um,

1207
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,990
so I'd have a, you know, music
in your car on a tape. So

1208
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:50,370
I liked Bushwick bill, who's a
rapper and Geto boys. Anyway. No.

1209
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:54,880
So, and it had, you know, punch of
swearing in it, but it was just a great,

1210
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:59,110
great album. And I liked it, but
I had it. We strangely in my mind,

1211
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:01,270
if I listen to like negative stuff,

1212
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,840
I'd have a negative day and
some people might say like,

1213
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,840
well who that's going to true.
But no, I don't think so.

1214
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,040
I think it doesn't matter
really what music you like.

1215
01:10:10,060 --> 01:10:14,020
Maybe my certain music might put you in
a certain mood, but that's up to you.

1216
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:15,381
Yeah,

1217
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:18,440
we're actually going in a whole nother
direction or which I'm fine with going

1218
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:22,880
there. Um, I have always
found that music to me,

1219
01:10:22,881 --> 01:10:27,800
like the words and the music.
I'm barely registering what they are.

1220
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:33,200
I know him. I'll be, it might even be
singing along with them in my mind,

1221
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:37,910
but, but the words generally
aren't having a huge impact.

1222
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:40,550
I mean I've listened to all kinds of
rock and roll music throughout my years.

1223
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,260
If I would've followed,
followed along with 10% of the lyrics,

1224
01:10:45,261 --> 01:10:48,260
I would probably be a heroin addict
in the gutter somewhere. Right.

1225
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,400
Cause you can't just listen to music
and obey. What they say. In fact,

1226
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:55,370
you shouldn't do that. Most music is
a lot of music is negative, right?

1227
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,210
I mean a lot of music is very
negative in what it's saying. So

1228
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:06,090
yeah. So what you're saying is the ritual
of listening to the right music is an

1229
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:06,900
important or not?

1230
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,490
No, not important at all. I'm just
saying I used to like kind of,

1231
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:14,280
I don't know if they fall for that trick,
but I young, I was like an intermediate

1232
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:16,860
school. So you believed it.
You believed at the time.

1233
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:19,680
If you listen to negative music you
might have a negative negative day. Yes.

1234
01:11:19,681 --> 01:11:20,341
And not the fame,

1235
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:23,070
not the kind of where it's like I'm going
to listen to this and then I choose to

1236
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,630
go.
This will fire me up to do what I,

1237
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,150
it wasn't that it was a
superstition is what it was.

1238
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,930
And I'm saying my point for the whole
thing is you don't like how people like

1239
01:11:30,931 --> 01:11:35,340
basically hang their success or failure
on some Ma visualization or some ritual

1240
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,391
and agree.

1241
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:41,391
Then that the point I'm making is I
would have to like remind myself of that.

1242
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,980
Like men,
the music,

1243
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,730
like nothing bad's going to happen to
me because I listened to Bushwick Bill.

1244
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,850
Talk about this thing that
I will say this though.

1245
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,570
That is a conscious decision
that you made. Yeah.

1246
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,480
Whereas if you were just listening,
I mean music changes your mood.

1247
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,210
Music changes my mood for sure.
Yeah.

1248
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:03,060
And when I hear certain music I get a
certain reaction to it and I will get into

1249
01:12:03,061 --> 01:12:07,020
a certain emotional state before I'm
listening to a song that's about something

1250
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:11,100
or not something else, you know,
that will have an effect on me now.

1251
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,490
I don't know that.

1252
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:19,170
My point is that eat the lyrics themselves
don't really mean anything I guess.

1253
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:21,660
I guess if they do mean something though,
and they hit me a certain way,

1254
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:24,810
music definitely will put you in a
different mood in my opinion. Yeah.

1255
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:25,740
If you let it,

1256
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:30,770
like if you're using it well I would
say put you in a mood unless you don't,

1257
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:33,630
don't let it. Yeah. Cause if
you just listen to it now,

1258
01:12:33,631 --> 01:12:36,990
there's times where you listen to whatever
music and it's just not going to hit

1259
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:41,100
you. But some music that you have
might have a core, uh, fought about.

1260
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:44,730
Now does this go back and
negate my earlier point?

1261
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,730
That music doesn't affect my mindset?
Does that do it?

1262
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:51,600
Am I right now I'm going back on
what I said, cause I said, oh,

1263
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:55,710
music doesn't affect your mindset. Uh,
I guess I am going to though. Yeah.

1264
01:12:55,740 --> 01:13:00,540
But ultimately I think,
I think really it holds up where you look,

1265
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:03,240
here's the deal,
here's the deal.

1266
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:07,380
You're going into a stressful combat
situation and you didn't get a chance to

1267
01:13:07,381 --> 01:13:10,830
listen to your song. Can you
afford to be like, oh no, I
can't go. No. So that's why,

1268
01:13:10,831 --> 01:13:15,240
that's another reason why yes, I'm staying
with my original point. Yeah, I agree.

1269
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:19,050
I agree with you. Let's stick with it.
Don't let anyone sway you. Don't let them,

1270
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,950
it's still a real bite
technicality though. Jocko.

1271
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:28,790
Is this question number five now or can
you speak about winging it and when it's

1272
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:34,671
best to just go for it and when making
a plan without the time to do still is

1273
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:39,870
the best course. Okay. Yeah, I can
definitely talk about that. Um,

1274
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:45,470
well winging it is never the first choice.

1275
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:50,540
And when,
when you see people in the,

1276
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:54,510
in the seal teams are in the military,
if they're winging something,

1277
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:57,210
it's something that
they've practiced a lot.

1278
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,130
If it's something that they have planned
Broglie before and they've so much

1279
01:14:02,131 --> 01:14:03,090
experience in that,

1280
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:07,830
whatever that type of operation that they
can actually get away with it. Right?

1281
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:12,100
And a good example, if you take a Jiu
Jitsu example like dean lister, he

1282
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,210
can wing it in a match.

1283
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:17,860
Jeff Glover can do that to a ridiculous
level of just winging it in competition

1284
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:22,690
and just show up and just do what
he does because he's got, you know,

1285
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:27,520
those guys at that high level have a
mental fluidity that's going to be very

1286
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:28,150
helpful for them.

1287
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:32,860
Now there's other people that are very
high level Jujitsu players that don't

1288
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:35,800
wing it,
that are very much more methodical.

1289
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:40,930
And I'm sure there's some cases with
both Jeff and dean where they probably

1290
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:42,550
should have been more methodical.

1291
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,020
But I mean Jeff has straight up
suicidal in many of his matches. I mean,

1292
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:49,090
and that's what's beautiful is,

1293
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:54,540
is that he moves so much so rapidly
that people can't hang with him on that

1294
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:58,930
level in most cases. Um, so that's
why he, he, he is winging it.

1295
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:03,130
Like every movement that he makes
is winging it. But case in point,

1296
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,060
he's puts himself in those
situations all the time.

1297
01:15:07,061 --> 01:15:08,590
You come to the gym and watch them train.

1298
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,160
He's letting people put him in the worst
possible situations and figuring a way

1299
01:15:12,161 --> 01:15:15,490
out of it. So the reason he can wing it
in the competitions, cause he's, he's,

1300
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,070
he's put putting practice and discipline,

1301
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:22,740
they're in the background and if you
saw my seal platoon or tasking it,

1302
01:15:22,741 --> 01:15:27,640
we could wing it on operations all the
time because we were prepared because we

1303
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:31,570
knew each other so well because we
had standard operating procedures that

1304
01:15:31,660 --> 01:15:36,660
covered so much of the things that would
happen during an operation where we

1305
01:15:37,361 --> 01:15:40,510
would be quote unquote winging it.
So even though we're winging it,

1306
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,930
we're not really winging it because
we have all these standard standard

1307
01:15:43,931 --> 01:15:47,680
operating procedures in place that
we didn't really need to plan.

1308
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:52,890
But if you have time to
plan and of course plan,

1309
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:55,990
do as much planning as you can,

1310
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:00,340
dig in and plan every
detail that you can plan.

1311
01:16:01,450 --> 01:16:05,320
Now
when it does come to planning,

1312
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:09,280
I think the most important part of a plan,

1313
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:14,400
the thing that makes a plan the most
effective is its flexibility and making a

1314
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:21,541
plan that is so flexible that when you
do the actual operation and you come up

1315
01:16:24,311 --> 01:16:28,360
against unexpected things which
are absolutely going to happen,

1316
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:30,700
you have the flexibility,
you have options,

1317
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:35,701
you have contingency plans to deal
with now so plan as much as you can.

1318
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:41,700
But the problem is with all that
emphasis on planning and sometimes people

1319
01:16:41,711 --> 01:16:46,711
become obsessed with planning and they
plan and they plan and they plan some

1320
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:50,410
more and they plan and they plan and plan
and they don't want to execute and if

1321
01:16:50,411 --> 01:16:52,540
they do execute,
they execute late.

1322
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,890
They missed their opportunity. So
that's why, that's why Patton said,

1323
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,250
I got this note written down here.

1324
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:04,810
Patents at a good plan violently executed
now is better than a perfect plan

1325
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:07,930
executed next week. Right.
That's what we're talking about.

1326
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:09,770
He's come up with a good plan.

1327
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,040
Don't come up with the perfect plan that
takes you two weeks to come up with.

1328
01:17:13,041 --> 01:17:14,030
That's not going to help you.

1329
01:17:14,870 --> 01:17:19,040
That's something you need to keep in
the front of your mind and that is

1330
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:24,041
especially applicable in a tactical
decision that's being made in the field,

1331
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:29,510
right? Something that is unfolding.
You see the enemy maneuvering.

1332
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:33,320
You come up with a quick plan and you
execute because every minute that you're

1333
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:34,340
waiting to execute,

1334
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:39,980
the enemy is maneuvering on you
that that low in enemy fire.

1335
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:44,000
That's not them retreating and running
away. No. Your mindset has to be that.

1336
01:17:44,001 --> 01:17:46,340
That's them maneuvering on you.
They're getting a better position.

1337
01:17:46,341 --> 01:17:50,000
They're setting up, getting ready to
crush you, so don't let that happen.

1338
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:56,410
Make a plan and go in.
That comes back again to flexibility.

1339
01:17:56,620 --> 01:18:00,820
If you come up with a good plan and
you go, as that plan is being executed,

1340
01:18:00,821 --> 01:18:01,840
you got to pay attention.

1341
01:18:02,690 --> 01:18:07,240
You've got to pay attention and watch
how it's unfolding it don't put the

1342
01:18:07,241 --> 01:18:09,850
blinders on and you've got your
plan and now we're going to go on.

1343
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:12,700
We're not going to look around anymore.
We're just gonna follow the plan. No,

1344
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:17,920
you have to be observant. You
have to observe, Orient, decide,

1345
01:18:17,921 --> 01:18:19,510
and act the whole time.

1346
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:23,230
You can't just come up with a plan and
stay on that track because when you come

1347
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,981
up with a fast plan,

1348
01:18:23,981 --> 01:18:27,610
you're not going to have thought about
every single detail and you don't know

1349
01:18:27,611 --> 01:18:28,780
what the enemy's going to do anyways.

1350
01:18:29,230 --> 01:18:31,840
You don't know what your competitor is
going to do. You can't guarantee that.

1351
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:35,620
So when you see them start to
react to your, what you executed,

1352
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,160
now you've got to be ready to
react yourself and get the art,

1353
01:18:39,190 --> 01:18:42,760
the the upper hand and take the offensive.
So

1354
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,720
there's an,
there's one more.

1355
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,940
There's one more little dichotomy to this,
and

1356
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:54,423
I'll just say it,

1357
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:59,110
even though I'm saying you got to adapt
your plan and you need to adjust as

1358
01:18:59,111 --> 01:19:01,870
things happen,
you also want to stick to your point.

1359
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:04,600
Those things are completely the
opposite of each other, right?

1360
01:19:04,601 --> 01:19:06,340
I'm saying adapt and
change your plan as needed,

1361
01:19:06,341 --> 01:19:09,520
but I'm also telling you to stick
to your plan. But for instance,

1362
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:12,280
if you rehearsed a,

1363
01:19:12,610 --> 01:19:17,090
or if you have a standard operating
procedure for your order of patrol.

1364
01:19:17,091 --> 01:19:20,310
So this is the, the order of, you
know, the point man, and it's,

1365
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:25,210
it's Jones and then Smith and then
Washington and then Jefferson,

1366
01:19:25,211 --> 01:19:26,530
and that's your border patrol,
right?

1367
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:30,910
And those guys were always marching in
that order. And so we know each other,

1368
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,880
we know how to work together,
we have fire team integrity,

1369
01:19:33,881 --> 01:19:37,630
we have a standard operating procedure,
and we're going to attack a target.

1370
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,170
And when we get closer to the target,
we see that, hey, you know what?

1371
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,440
Maybe it'd be better to move this guy
over here and move this guy over here.

1372
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:48,760
And so let's,
let's change our standard order of March,

1373
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:51,130
our standard patrolling order,
because it'll,

1374
01:19:51,131 --> 01:19:52,990
it'll be easier when we get to the target.

1375
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:54,103
Hmm.

1376
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:58,260
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

1377
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:02,670
You have your standard
operating procedures are
for a reason. You have them.

1378
01:20:02,671 --> 01:20:06,780
And when you start pulling yourself out
of the standard operating procedures for

1379
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:11,670
good reason, that's going to
come back and bite you. It's,

1380
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:16,110
it's not gonna work out good.
So be flexible.

1381
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,470
This is going to be an interesting
statement and be flexible but stick to the

1382
01:20:21,471 --> 01:20:26,471
plan but be ready to adjust but
stick to the plan and that's totally

1383
01:20:29,301 --> 01:20:32,420
contradictory and I know
that and I apologize,

1384
01:20:33,710 --> 01:20:35,090
but that is what leadership is.

1385
01:20:35,091 --> 01:20:39,050
Leadership is balancing those dichotomies
in leadership is knowing when, hey,

1386
01:20:39,051 --> 01:20:40,760
we stayed with our standard
operating procedure.

1387
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:43,040
We're going to hold through it
through this little thing right here.

1388
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:46,220
You know there's been, there's a little
small terrain feature we didn't expect.

1389
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:50,900
We could change our plan right now and
adapt to that in the unlikely event that

1390
01:20:50,901 --> 01:20:55,040
or the the small chance that something
happens and we'll be better for it at

1391
01:20:55,041 --> 01:20:59,540
that moment. No, stay with your
standard operating procedure.

1392
01:20:59,690 --> 01:21:03,410
But then when something dramatic
happens and you need to make a change,

1393
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:07,520
you do it aggressively, you
do it dynamically and then
you continue to observe,

1394
01:21:07,521 --> 01:21:11,960
Orient, decide and act and stick. Keep
beating the enemy inside the [inaudible]

1395
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:16,690
Ooda loop.
That's it.

1396
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:25,630
Next question, Jocko. Yes. An Echo.

1397
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:26,943
Oh,

1398
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:31,410
Bjj ex partner is training in another gym.

1399
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:34,170
Now my head coach banned him

1400
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:39,220
from coming back.
The question.

1401
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,290
So dojo,
loyalty versus freedom.

1402
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:44,330
Okay,
what up?

1403
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:48,980
So there is some tradition
behind this actually. Yup.

1404
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:54,310
And the tradition is actually
the attrition of the Crayon,

1405
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:58,560
which means that's so crayon.

1406
01:21:58,561 --> 01:22:03,480
She is a, it's a Brazilian word
and it's a name, right? It's a,

1407
01:22:03,481 --> 01:22:08,481
it's a name from a character
in a Brazilian soap opera.

1408
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:11,930
You're looking at me like you
didn't know that, did you? This,

1409
01:22:11,931 --> 01:22:13,380
I didn't know you didn't know this,

1410
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:18,330
but of course everyone knows
[inaudible] Jitsu Korean. She came from,

1411
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,410
it's a character in a Brazilian
soap opera that was like a,

1412
01:22:22,790 --> 01:22:26,400
a backstabber look. An
unloyal guide. Yeah. Right.

1413
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,050
And so when,

1414
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:32,460
especially back in the early
days for me in Jujitsu,

1415
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:37,490
which was pretty early days in America
for Jujitsu in the 90s if anyone was

1416
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:43,050
going from gym to gym or even left a
gym permanently to go to another gym,

1417
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:46,900
they were labeled this horrible word.
It was the,

1418
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:51,390
it was the worst thing you could call
somebody, right? It was like, yeah,

1419
01:22:51,391 --> 01:22:55,350
this guy's a crunchy. And that
meant that they were a trader. Yeah.

1420
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,680
That's what it meant. And
there's also, so that's,

1421
01:22:58,681 --> 01:23:01,470
there's a tradition of it in Jujitsu,
right,

1422
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:06,190
of this idea that if you change gyms
or you trained in a different place,

1423
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:10,780
you're a coach. Now there's a
little backlash against that.

1424
01:23:10,781 --> 01:23:13,900
And there's people that have,
you know, I a matter of fact,

1425
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:17,010
we used to joke about being
like team crayon. She was,

1426
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,410
we were all training at different places
and trying to find the best places to

1427
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:22,810
train. I, but there's,
beyond that, there's a,

1428
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:26,650
there's a martial arts kind of
tradition as well, which is, you know,

1429
01:23:26,651 --> 01:23:31,480
loyalty and gratitude to your instructor,
right?

1430
01:23:31,481 --> 01:23:36,100
That's a, that's a fairly understood
tradition, not just in the martial arts,

1431
01:23:36,101 --> 01:23:41,101
but in any arena where you're learning
something from somebody that's putting

1432
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:44,200
their time and effort into you
to instruct you in something.

1433
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:49,890
And there's also a practical
level of reasoning behind this.

1434
01:23:52,391 --> 01:23:55,630
And that is competition,
right?

1435
01:23:55,631 --> 01:24:00,070
So if you're going to be competing and
you compete with a guy at your gym that's

1436
01:24:00,071 --> 01:24:01,870
got an unbelievable triangle,

1437
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:07,620
and then somebody else comes from another
school and they are basically wrong

1438
01:24:08,141 --> 01:24:09,730
with that guy. And they said
he's got a really good triangle.

1439
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:12,130
Now you're in a competition against
that guy. And he tells his buddy, hey,

1440
01:24:12,131 --> 01:24:14,620
that guy you're gonna compete against
has a really good triangle watch out for

1441
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:17,830
is triangle. You know, that can change
the outcome of the match. You know,

1442
01:24:17,831 --> 01:24:21,340
the details of it and all that stuff that
can change the outcome of a match. So

1443
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:28,240
there's a practical level to it. You
know, there's also sharing moves,

1444
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:28,720
right?

1445
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:33,310
And if certain schools might have a
really good series of moves are moves and

1446
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:35,740
all of a sudden someone goes to,
you know, train somewhere else,

1447
01:24:35,741 --> 01:24:37,720
they can share that move.
And that's bad.

1448
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:41,200
And you know what's interesting
is in every business,

1449
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:46,330
most businesses that I work with, I should
say they have their own little worlds,

1450
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:51,120
right? And they have their own
kind of loyalty and Crayon. She,

1451
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:55,120
and if you, if you're at
you, you pick an industry,

1452
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:57,700
people are good in that industry.
And when they change companies,

1453
01:24:57,790 --> 01:25:01,210
they bring with them the same kind of
thing. They bring maybe some secret sauce,

1454
01:25:01,211 --> 01:25:03,010
maybe some moves,
maybe they know some personalities,

1455
01:25:03,011 --> 01:25:06,370
they know the weakness of that
other company. So when they leave,

1456
01:25:06,371 --> 01:25:10,030
there's a loyalty factor
that comes into it. Now

1457
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:15,580
that being said,
loyalty goes both ways.

1458
01:25:15,581 --> 01:25:19,540
And I've talked about this before.
The student should be loyal, right?

1459
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:22,570
But the teacher has to be loyal as well.

1460
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:25,330
That means they have to be teaching
solid stuff. That means they need to,

1461
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:29,090
you know, train correctly. That means
they need to offer enough classes,

1462
01:25:29,120 --> 01:25:33,880
all kinds of things right there. The
teacher, oh, some loyalty to the students.

1463
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:37,090
And on top of that,
on top of that,

1464
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,060
this is America, right? This
is America. And in America,

1465
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:47,590
you pay to go to a school.
You pay money, right?

1466
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:48,490
It costs you money.

1467
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:53,710
And I always use this example when
people ask me about this in America,

1468
01:25:54,190 --> 01:25:59,190
just because you normally get your pizza
from Domino's doesn't mean that if you

1469
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:03,550
feel like you can't get to call up
little Caesar's and some common cause,

1470
01:26:03,551 --> 01:26:06,200
it's getting, it's America,
l. A. N. N. N. If guess what?

1471
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:08,300
If little Caesars makes a better pizza,

1472
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,980
you're going to maybe order even
more often. Yeah. So it's, there's,

1473
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:14,180
there's competition,
right?

1474
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:19,210
And you want to end up where you
get the best pizza and there's so,

1475
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:24,020
so there's some advantages to looking
for that good pizza. There's, there's,

1476
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,900
and there's some advantages to traveling
around and good training at different

1477
01:26:26,901 --> 01:26:28,840
places because you're
going to get different, um,

1478
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:33,230
schools with different instructors that
have different specialties and different

1479
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:34,064
styles

1480
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:38,780
so that can be advantageous.

1481
01:26:38,781 --> 01:26:43,760
There's also some disadvantages to school.

1482
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:45,000
They'll go into a bunch
of different schools.

1483
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,060
Number one is your teacher
doesn't really know you,

1484
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:50,600
so now your teacher
doesn't know your style,

1485
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,670
doesn't know what moves
would be good for you.

1486
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:56,660
They also don't see you progress because
you're only coming back every once in a

1487
01:26:56,661 --> 01:26:57,440
while.
And whenever they don't,

1488
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,410
they don't see you getting
any better and they're not,

1489
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:06,200
they're not really maybe as comfortable
teaching you everything because you're

1490
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:10,790
not really their students. And you
know what man? It is a, it's a, it's a,

1491
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,910
it's a powerful thing to teach
someone Jujitsu and him and it's,

1492
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:17,000
it's an effort and there's
an emotional component to it.

1493
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:18,900
When you teach somebody Jujitsu,

1494
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:23,060
there's an emotional thing that you're
giving them something and there's an

1495
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:28,040
emotional level in there somewhere
that says, you know what,

1496
01:27:28,041 --> 01:27:31,370
I'm giving you this.
Not going to hold it over your head,

1497
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:35,240
but you know, there's this
little song from there. You,

1498
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:38,660
I'm not going to say you owe me anything,
but you owe me a little something.

1499
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,640
Wait, wait, like, like what
you like, so I taught you this.

1500
01:27:41,641 --> 01:27:45,810
So now you need to go and not mess it
up or you got to represent or is it like

1501
01:27:45,811 --> 01:27:49,200
don't use this to, I dunno.
I think what he means.

1502
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:53,590
I think it's a little bit of both of,
you know, I'm investing all this in you,

1503
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:57,790
right?
Sure you're giving me 100 bucks a month,

1504
01:27:58,510 --> 01:28:01,570
but what I'm giving you is worth
more than a hundred bucks a month.

1505
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,100
Like we know that,
right?

1506
01:28:03,790 --> 01:28:07,120
So give me something back.

1507
01:28:07,121 --> 01:28:11,380
What do I want back and want you to train
with me? You know what I mean? Just, hey,

1508
01:28:11,381 --> 01:28:13,510
you going to go to another school
and you're going to train there.

1509
01:28:13,511 --> 01:28:16,420
Sometimes I understand
that, but oh, wait a second,

1510
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:18,940
now I'm just your part time teacher.
Okay,

1511
01:28:18,941 --> 01:28:22,810
well I'm not going to invest very much
in you anymore. Right? So there's a,

1512
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:27,340
there's an emotional
component to it. Now, again,

1513
01:28:27,341 --> 01:28:29,950
back to the advantages, because there's
a dichotomy of everything, right?

1514
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:32,740
You're rolling with different
people at different schools. Like,

1515
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:35,130
is it one thing that's nice
about our schools? We got, uh,

1516
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,950
we got different instructors
with different styles. I mean,

1517
01:28:38,951 --> 01:28:43,000
between Dean and Jeff, they are literally
at the opposite end of the spectrum,

1518
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:47,710
which is fricking awesome to have there
at the opposite ends of the spectrums of

1519
01:28:47,711 --> 01:28:52,030
the Jujitsu skillset. Right?
They're just crazy different.

1520
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:54,670
They almost don't look like
they're doing the same sport.

1521
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:56,200
And when I trained with both of them,

1522
01:28:56,770 --> 01:28:59,290
I don't feel like I'm doing
the same sport different.

1523
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:03,270
It's just a totally different game.
But you've got James Nielsen

1524
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:07,950
who's got his own style of Jujitsu,
which is insane. Uh, Greg train,

1525
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:12,150
obviously you got him combinant hot,
whom I missing Adam.

1526
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:17,130
He's teaching hose his own
little different style. Who
else? Jeff, Jeffrey Owl.

1527
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:22,180
Jeffrey House got his bad ass game fast.
Me,

1528
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:23,880
I don't know what I don't teach myself,

1529
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:26,880
but I'm sure that there is a
different element there. Yeah.

1530
01:29:26,881 --> 01:29:29,880
But you coach up and stuff like
people learn from me. I know.

1531
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:34,690
I like a lot of stuff I learned
from you, you know, and like
you're like, um, uh, to,

1532
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:38,250
to tillage, whatever, you know, like
you train with Jeff all the time,

1533
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:41,310
you're going to learn some real creative
dynamic stuff you learned from Dean,

1534
01:29:41,311 --> 01:29:44,490
you're going to learn a lot of stuff
like in, you know, in that way.

1535
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,940
So I think a lot of people still,
even though you're not instructing you,

1536
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:52,770
they do learn a lot from you. Yeah.
And I do teach from time to time.

1537
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:57,420
Um, but yes, I do. And I do when I
teach, a lot of times when I'm teaching,

1538
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,870
I might not be teaching the class.
Right, right. I'm saying, hey buddy,

1539
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:05,340
go check this out. Yeah, it's over
here. So, so those are advantages.

1540
01:30:05,870 --> 01:30:08,250
If you were at a school
with one instructor,

1541
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:11,580
then I could see where
you'd be going, man. Okay.

1542
01:30:12,150 --> 01:30:15,030
There could be an advantage if I go
try some other instructors. Again,

1543
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:19,880
there's a trade off because now, now
you start learning something. I said,

1544
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:21,750
I actually see this more with striking,

1545
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:27,290
which with striking training where guys
that move around from different coach,

1546
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:31,050
different striking instructors,
a lot they don't,

1547
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,280
it's not like Jujitsu where you can
incorporate it in and you learn something

1548
01:30:35,281 --> 01:30:38,100
from some other guy and you bring it
into your game and you change it a little

1549
01:30:38,101 --> 01:30:41,100
bit. When I see people move
striking coaches a lot,

1550
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:46,340
I see their game actually deteriorate
in my opinion because striking is more

1551
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,940
instinctive. It's an
instinctive thing, right?

1552
01:30:50,941 --> 01:30:53,280
You're throwing your
combos and you let them go,

1553
01:30:53,370 --> 01:30:57,510
like you let your combos go and you react.
It's, it's just something that happens.

1554
01:30:57,610 --> 01:30:58,740
It's more mechanical,

1555
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:04,050
so when you train mechanically to react
and to throw your combos the way you're

1556
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:06,830
throwing them and then all of a sudden
you change that and you want to throw him

1557
01:31:06,831 --> 01:31:09,030
a different way.
I think it trips people up.

1558
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,680
I think it sets them
backwards a little bit.

1559
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,230
Whereas digital you can
incorporate new games,

1560
01:31:13,231 --> 01:31:17,970
different parts of games more fluidly.
And also striking when you're training,

1561
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:22,620
striking, you did too short, you learn
moves from the Co, your instructor,

1562
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:26,340
he learned, you know, some timing
stuff, but it's like instruction.

1563
01:31:26,341 --> 01:31:29,040
But then you have to
train with a multitude,

1564
01:31:29,041 --> 01:31:32,430
like all your training partners introduced
to and that's part of your training.

1565
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:35,400
So if you go striking, it's
not really like that. In fact,

1566
01:31:35,401 --> 01:31:36,750
most strikers they'll stay,

1567
01:31:36,780 --> 01:31:39,390
they'll stick with one coach and then
they'll have a multitude of sparring

1568
01:31:39,391 --> 01:31:44,280
partners that changes. And Jujitsu just
by its own nature is already like that.

1569
01:31:44,281 --> 01:31:45,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1570
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:50,210
And when you spar against other people
striking though your fundamental

1571
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:54,780
movements, they'll change a lot less
than they will when you're rolling.

1572
01:31:54,781 --> 01:31:57,240
We just took down a bunch of different
people using more of your body.

1573
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,190
There's just striking

1574
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:04,690
is linear. Yeah, morning. And
Jujitsu is completely not linear.

1575
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:08,260
So therefore when you're
training something that's
linear and you start going

1576
01:32:08,261 --> 01:32:11,710
off that line,
it trips you up in my opinion.

1577
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,530
But we do Jitsu, it can be
beneficial at times too. Um,

1578
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:21,520
train with some other people.
Advantages and disadvantages.

1579
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:26,320
So I guess to get to these question,
long winded answer,

1580
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:30,460
um, one, you know,

1581
01:32:31,540 --> 01:32:35,440
what is it? The head coach banned him
from coming back. That's a bummer.

1582
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,670
That's a bummer. I, I'm,
I'm sorry to hear that.

1583
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:44,140
I've never banned anyone from our
school for going and training in another

1584
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:48,970
school. Yeah. I'm not intimidated
by that. Right. If someone goes,

1585
01:32:48,971 --> 01:32:51,340
Hey, I'm going to go train it,
there's other school, I'm like, cool.

1586
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:57,010
And they come back because they get
there and they go, okay, this is cool,

1587
01:32:57,011 --> 01:33:00,190
but I'm going to come back to where we
get this training that we have at victory.

1588
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:01,780
Right.
Which I'm comfortable with.

1589
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:04,270
And if someone goes somewhere
and goes and goes, oh,

1590
01:33:04,271 --> 01:33:09,100
I like this place better than victory.
That's cool. Good luck. I mean, it's all,

1591
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:13,760
and you know, in a year they come back
and go, yeah, I'm coming back. You know,

1592
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:17,560
I don't get mad at them because
everyone's on their own journey,

1593
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:18,640
I guess you could say.

1594
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,360
Everyone's finding their own path and I'm
not going to force people down a path.

1595
01:33:23,110 --> 01:33:26,770
I might recommend a path,
you know, I might say, you
know, and I do that, you know,

1596
01:33:26,771 --> 01:33:29,440
that's what, that's what we have the
gym for. It's like here's a path man.

1597
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,880
And it's wide open.

1598
01:33:30,881 --> 01:33:35,410
It's a beautiful path with
incredible Jujitsu practitioners.

1599
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:39,520
So I don't, I'm kind of bummed out
to here, you know? But that happens.

1600
01:33:39,521 --> 01:33:42,280
But I do understand and I
think that's what if I was,

1601
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:48,130
if I were in that position where I'm at
a school and my training partner leaves

1602
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:52,810
and then he gets banned that I
don't like that. I don't like that.

1603
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:54,640
Yeah.
Let me get some,

1604
01:33:55,090 --> 01:33:59,720
yeah. I think security group and
hear everywhere is kind of different.

1605
01:33:59,721 --> 01:34:03,440
Here is kind of a situation here
in southern California. God,

1606
01:34:03,441 --> 01:34:07,400
especially in disability, Nicholas
situation, we got the Jujitsu everywhere.

1607
01:34:07,401 --> 01:34:10,520
Everywhere. Yes. So, and it's
literally on every street corner.

1608
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:14,510
In some cases you can
literally walk comfortably,

1609
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:18,380
comfortably. It's like one block to
the next one and it's a good one too.

1610
01:34:18,381 --> 01:34:20,360
That's the thing.
There's just a schools everywhere.

1611
01:34:20,361 --> 01:34:23,750
I'm sorry for those of you that live
in the non Jujitsu parks in the world,

1612
01:34:24,110 --> 01:34:24,950
I'm sorry,

1613
01:34:25,490 --> 01:34:30,110
we have a lot of g do her in San Diego
we have like our and southern California

1614
01:34:30,111 --> 01:34:32,930
in general. Orange County, la is crazy.

1615
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:38,480
So you figure in San Diego what's going
to kind of be a result of that is like

1616
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:43,460
our situation. For example, we
have dean who's kind of the,

1617
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:47,570
the main guy who kinda came
in with the school, right?

1618
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:50,600
Remember Dean had the small kind
of school do the boxing club,

1619
01:34:50,660 --> 01:34:53,750
came to throw down is what it was called,
became victory.

1620
01:34:54,650 --> 01:34:59,340
But with Dean was like a bunch
of guys like for Ileus. Um,

1621
01:34:59,510 --> 01:35:01,190
James, nils, nils thin.

1622
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,430
Some other guys from Fabio Santos and
we all trained together at least was

1623
01:35:04,431 --> 01:35:05,570
instructor,
like all these guys.

1624
01:35:05,571 --> 01:35:09,260
And then some guys went and
open their own school now.

1625
01:35:09,261 --> 01:35:14,090
So not as a result of that whole
situation. Sure. We have other schools,

1626
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,720
but they're kind of still are guys in a
weird way. There are different things.

1627
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:19,610
So if I go train with the [inaudible],

1628
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,340
which I Johnny for he another one
who my instructor for a little while,

1629
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:27,110
I'll go treat with Johnny sometime.
And then w is that,

1630
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:30,560
is that a fantasy situation? No.
Yeah. I mean even technically.

1631
01:35:30,561 --> 01:35:33,740
Is that a crunchy situation though?
You're asking me technically, I would say,

1632
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:38,450
I would say back 10 years ago. Yeah.
That would be a major crouch situation.

1633
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:43,490
Is it right now for me? No. I want you to
get better at Jujitsu, right? Yes or no.

1634
01:35:43,491 --> 01:35:45,410
And if,
if you got an opportunity to go,

1635
01:35:45,411 --> 01:35:48,970
you're going to be trained
at another school. That's
cool. Yeah. Cause it's, it's,

1636
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:51,930
it's gonna make you better. It doesn't,
it doesn't offend me. You know what?

1637
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,620
I'm not a jealous husband. Right.
I'm not jealous of, of that.

1638
01:35:57,650 --> 01:36:00,260
I don't think, oh, what if he
goes and never comes? I know you,

1639
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:04,430
I know where it's at. Right.
And, and, and so it's all good.

1640
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:09,210
You know who I'm coming home to them.
That's right. That's right. Well,

1641
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:12,620
I think the culture just in general
is shifting. And I think this is this,

1642
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,260
like in southern California,
it's going to be more like this,

1643
01:36:15,261 --> 01:36:18,290
like way more laid back. Of
course he get, you know, little,

1644
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:22,610
little tiny little groups of people
who still believe that even though,

1645
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,860
but the really the community like that,
in fact,

1646
01:36:24,861 --> 01:36:27,570
have you considered studio
five 40? That's a crayon. Ge,

1647
01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:32,600
GM might will be called Crayon, GE capital
all the way down to the instructors,

1648
01:36:32,601 --> 01:36:35,200
not Fabio Santos would teach
there one day if I'm just on,

1649
01:36:35,201 --> 01:36:37,610
just has his own gym by the
way. Arizona. Kevin, by the way,

1650
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:38,810
same thing with the Higgs.

1651
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:42,950
Like all these are guys who came from
other academies and they invite whoever

1652
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:45,390
and they actually have other
fabulous currently. Yup.

1653
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:48,560
You can go visit when I visit all the
time, you know, everyone knows each other.

1654
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:50,720
So it's like the culture is different.
And I think,

1655
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:55,640
I think with our gym it's not as,
uh, not as pronounced as that,

1656
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,510
but we definitely, I mean, people come
in every day from, we're all over.

1657
01:37:00,020 --> 01:37:02,990
How many victims were represented today,
Matt?

1658
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:07,860
There was guys from all over San Diego,
guys from all over the country, a victory,

1659
01:37:08,180 --> 01:37:11,950
you know, showing up from Seattle trooper
wanting to get his game on, you know.

1660
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:16,030
Right on, you know I haven't tell
America yeah, that's right. These,

1661
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:18,970
these mode up there. Yeah,
he was good and that,

1662
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:21,980
and that's the cool thing you
said at Dean said it, he said,

1663
01:37:21,981 --> 01:37:26,981
I encourage you to go to other gyms or
I mean not to be some sweared spy big

1664
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,070
Bro. If you want to go get training, cause
I was going up to Eddie Bravo's when,

1665
01:37:31,071 --> 01:37:32,080
this was long time ago when he,

1666
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:35,880
when he was at like legends
and I was going up there
for work or whatever and um,

1667
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,460
you know,
I knew about that or it's like,

1668
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:39,740
oh is that kind of
backstabbing if I go train,

1669
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:43,720
you didn't tell me that you
were doing that. Actually I do.

1670
01:37:43,721 --> 01:37:45,710
It wasn't about any brothers one,
but it was about something else.

1671
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:47,660
I did tell you and he said the
same thing. He was like, Bro,

1672
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:50,840
you get as much training as you
can, you know, if you want to,

1673
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:54,770
if you want to be a part of this
association academy or whatever,

1674
01:37:54,771 --> 01:37:56,250
then up to you and

1675
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:57,690
I'm glad you're here,
whatever,

1676
01:37:57,691 --> 01:38:00,930
and I don't think personally that you're
going to do it, but pray your care date,

1677
01:38:00,931 --> 01:38:04,200
learn Jujitsu. And if you can
learn some Jujitsu over there,

1678
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:08,430
like more of a certain type, then you can
hear or anywhere, fine. Go do it. Yeah.

1679
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:11,650
He said the moral juices you learn
the better. So I was like, Dang,

1680
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,540
quit from Dean lister right there. Yeah.
That more digits or you learn the better.

1681
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:16,830
Yeah.
And then,

1682
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:22,190
and then so even to kind of go
above and beyond that is when you,

1683
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,800
okay, well let's say, you know what
I got to when to interject here is,

1684
01:38:25,801 --> 01:38:29,690
especially for some of these academies out
there, men Jiu Jitsu it, it's like you,

1685
01:38:29,691 --> 01:38:32,910
you're a doctor because you went through
10 years of school to get your black

1686
01:38:32,911 --> 01:38:36,150
belt. Just like a doctor goes. And
what sucks is when you're a doctor,

1687
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:40,290
you make x amount of money. It's a very
steady paycheck and you're kind of set.

1688
01:38:40,710 --> 01:38:42,390
Jujitsu doesn't mean anything.

1689
01:38:42,570 --> 01:38:45,540
That black belt that you worked
10 years for doesn't get you paid.

1690
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:50,610
So the reason I'm saying this is some
of the people that are more defensive

1691
01:38:50,611 --> 01:38:55,290
about this, if they're an instructor and
they have a small academy, they need,

1692
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:58,950
they, you're financially supporting
them. They worked hard to do that.

1693
01:38:58,951 --> 01:39:02,130
They've invested in you, they counting on
you. So when you just go, oh, you know,

1694
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:03,570
I'm gonna go train somewhere else that,

1695
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:06,780
that not only does it hurt them
emotionally, like I said, cause man,

1696
01:39:06,781 --> 01:39:10,140
when you put some effort into
somebody, you feel like, oh,

1697
01:39:10,230 --> 01:39:13,280
you're going to leave after I gave you
all of that and you didn't give it to him

1698
01:39:13,281 --> 01:39:14,160
cause you,
they paid,

1699
01:39:14,161 --> 01:39:18,210
but you gave them the value that you
get out of Jujitsu is not worth $100 a

1700
01:39:18,211 --> 01:39:22,860
month. It's worth $1,000 a month.
It's worth, it's worth a ton of money.

1701
01:39:23,010 --> 01:39:26,850
Keeling put that on his, uh, on,
on some social media posts that he,

1702
01:39:26,851 --> 01:39:30,270
because he got his black belt shoe and
when he did, he's like, well, you're rich.

1703
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:34,090
When you got something that money can't
buy. And that's the truth, right? And,

1704
01:39:34,230 --> 01:39:38,280
but that black belt doesn't get you
any money. It doesn't mean anything.

1705
01:39:38,281 --> 01:39:43,260
So there's another component to this
whole thing that if you're leaving and

1706
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:46,200
going to different schools and someone
thinking, Oh man, I'm going to lose,

1707
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,140
you know, this is how I feed my,
there's, you know, Jujitsu is,

1708
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:50,580
you want to become a Jujitsu instructor,

1709
01:39:50,730 --> 01:39:54,540
you're generally not going to become a
rich person, right? Not financially rich.

1710
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:57,720
So there's that component too.
Now,

1711
01:39:57,721 --> 01:40:02,721
luckily we have a big gym and it's a
little easier for guys to come and go.

1712
01:40:02,910 --> 01:40:06,510
It's okay. You know, we're
not sweating it as bad. Um,

1713
01:40:06,990 --> 01:40:11,500
and yeah, so you gotta, you gotta
keep that in mind as well that your,

1714
01:40:11,501 --> 01:40:14,690
your coach that's poured more
than what you've paid them.

1715
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:16,830
Because I don't just want to say,
hey look,

1716
01:40:16,831 --> 01:40:20,100
I'm paying for this instruction so you
owe it to me and I'll go do whatever I

1717
01:40:20,101 --> 01:40:20,640
want.

1718
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:25,640
That's to base of a statement to make
truly Jujitsu has more value than the

1719
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,280
hundred dollars a month you're paying
for it. Yeah, and you'd really,

1720
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:32,440
as a quote unquote customer or member,
I mean everyone's different.

1721
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:33,720
There's sure there's exceptions to this,

1722
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:36,940
but generally you don't want that
anyway. Even if you think you do. Like I,

1723
01:40:37,410 --> 01:40:41,580
I sh I can be free to come and go and
technically you are free to come and go as

1724
01:40:41,581 --> 01:40:42,270
soon as you are,

1725
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:45,240
but don't think that like everyone's
going to be just a hundred percent fine

1726
01:40:45,241 --> 01:40:48,960
with it all the time because
when, when you, when you come in,

1727
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:53,890
like how you said like it's a kind of
a two way street, you would hopefully,

1728
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,390
I hope my coach takes pride
in what he taught me for sure.

1729
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:01,690
Hope my coaches like I care about
how good you become for sure.

1730
01:41:01,750 --> 01:41:04,600
I hope he's not the guy who's like,
give me the check,

1731
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:08,020
I'll teach my moves and who
cares about how good you get an,

1732
01:41:08,021 --> 01:41:11,410
I don't want that guy. You don't
want that guy. Yep. So there is that.

1733
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:14,620
And so that makes sense is
it is that two way street,

1734
01:41:14,770 --> 01:41:18,670
but as a competitor or a practitioner
guy learning as a student,

1735
01:41:19,050 --> 01:41:22,420
especially when you reach a certain level
and you've been training with kind of

1736
01:41:22,421 --> 01:41:22,901
the same,

1737
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:27,400
even like 2025 guys will say you've been
training with these same 20 which is a

1738
01:41:27,401 --> 01:41:30,760
lot of guys, by the way, totally strained
with, you've been trained with them for,

1739
01:41:30,761 --> 01:41:35,710
I don't know, whatever, eight years we'll
say. And then you go to another gym, man,

1740
01:41:35,711 --> 01:41:39,670
that's a way different look. So it's
like fresh brand, new types of training,

1741
01:41:39,671 --> 01:41:41,860
you know, it's like you're
almost going to competition,

1742
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:43,780
but you're not competing
because we need to compete.

1743
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:46,170
You get to go against people who never
trained with before. Yeah. So yeah,

1744
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:49,240
different guys, different. And
that's, aside from even the debt,

1745
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:52,220
different teddy meetings. You know what
I find when I go into situations, when I,

1746
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:54,910
when I trained with somebody that doesn't,
I don't train with all the time,

1747
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,310
it's just you,
you feel a lot better at Jujitsu.

1748
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:01,960
Cause they don't because they don't know
you're gay, you're gay and you know, we,

1749
01:42:01,961 --> 01:42:03,670
you know, everyone's got their
own little special thing.

1750
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,710
So I always feel like a little
bit better when I go see it.

1751
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:11,860
And that's part of my point where if
you train with 25 guys, those 25 guys,

1752
01:42:11,861 --> 01:42:14,620
they know your game. And not to say
it's not good drinks, good training,

1753
01:42:14,621 --> 01:42:15,850
but they know your game.

1754
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:20,380
So it may not be as accurate as far as
like training competition or something

1755
01:42:20,381 --> 01:42:24,460
like that after a while. So when
you go to these new places you get,

1756
01:42:24,461 --> 01:42:26,080
that's an additional layer of,
of training.

1757
01:42:26,081 --> 01:42:30,190
You get another subject on this as a
kind of always bummed me out when I would

1758
01:42:30,191 --> 01:42:34,240
hear from my Jujitsu friends that have
we been in San Diego for 20 something

1759
01:42:34,241 --> 01:42:36,250
years and all of a sudden be like,
oh,

1760
01:42:36,251 --> 01:42:39,640
we can't come to your school because
our instructor doesn't want us to.

1761
01:42:39,641 --> 01:42:43,510
And I always be like, Bro, the,
yeah, that's, so that's like,

1762
01:42:43,540 --> 01:42:46,560
I wouldn't tell somebody that I'm
not trying to control people. Yeah.

1763
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,033
And it bums me out.

1764
01:42:48,130 --> 01:42:53,130
So that actually brings up another subject
that I feel like I have to talk about

1765
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:58,480
because we got a lot of people out there
that are starting Jujitsu for the first

1766
01:42:58,481 --> 01:43:02,530
time. A lot of troopers that are getting
in the Jujitsu game, which is awesome.

1767
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,170
It's awesome. And I get a
lot of people saying, oh,

1768
01:43:05,230 --> 01:43:09,550
what school should I train at in wherever?
Throw a dart at a map in America.

1769
01:43:09,551 --> 01:43:11,440
And that's what they're asking me about.
First of all,

1770
01:43:11,441 --> 01:43:15,460
I don't know all those instructors.
Now generally, you know,

1771
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:16,590
somebody that does Jujitsu,

1772
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:21,580
we'll look at a website and see what
a guy's credentials are and say, yeah,

1773
01:43:21,581 --> 01:43:24,280
that guy looks like a legit
black belt or legit brown belt.

1774
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:25,240
Or even a guy asked me the day,

1775
01:43:25,241 --> 01:43:28,290
is it worth learning from a purple belt
if there's no one else around them?

1776
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:31,780
Like absolutely. Absolutely. So,

1777
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:34,970
but people ask me about these schools
and I kind of give them my best guests.

1778
01:43:34,990 --> 01:43:38,320
Like, you know, I'll take a look
at the website and um, you know,

1779
01:43:38,321 --> 01:43:41,530
see if there's a backlog. You
don't need to ask me. By the way,

1780
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:46,300
Google look at their record,
make sure that they do Brazilian Jujitsu,

1781
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:50,320
not some other form of Jujitsu. Um, just,

1782
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:52,340
just,
you can figure

1783
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:54,900
it out. You don't need, you're going
to go to the school and assess.

1784
01:43:54,901 --> 01:43:55,611
But what I want,

1785
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:59,270
the main point that I wanted to bring
up isn't that it's just this part here,

1786
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:04,480
is that being into Jujitsu doesn't
mean that a person is a good person.

1787
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:12,430
And being a black belt in Jujitsu
doesn't have anything to do with their

1788
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:21,020
character as a person. And
I hate to say that. Um,

1789
01:44:21,290 --> 01:44:25,760
and, and there is a level of, to
get to be a black belt in Jujitsu.

1790
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,350
Sure. You could say in general it
means you're a committed person.

1791
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:33,890
In general. It means you're a
hardworking person in general.

1792
01:44:33,891 --> 01:44:38,300
It means that you've been humbled by
your experiences on the map in general.

1793
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:41,990
But it is no way a fact.

1794
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:47,830
And there are people in the Jujitsu
game that are swindlers and fiefs and

1795
01:44:53,241 --> 01:44:54,740
they're untrustworthy.

1796
01:44:54,741 --> 01:44:59,741
And there's a black belt in Jujitsu that
can be bullies and there's people in

1797
01:45:02,181 --> 01:45:06,830
Jiu Jitsu that can be predators
and you know, Jujitsu,

1798
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:07,753
it's a power.

1799
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:13,630
And sometimes people that are power hungry
recognize that power and they pursue

1800
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:21,250
the gaining of Jujitsu power
and then they abuse that power.

1801
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:26,580
So like any,
um,

1802
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:31,640
abusive situation where one person has
a perceived power over another person,

1803
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:32,960
it can get very ugly.

1804
01:45:32,961 --> 01:45:37,310
And there's all kinds of abuses that
I've seen take place over the years and a

1805
01:45:37,311 --> 01:45:41,990
Jujitsu world, financial
abuses, physical abuse,

1806
01:45:41,991 --> 01:45:43,970
and even sexual abuse.

1807
01:45:45,950 --> 01:45:49,640
So I just wanted to get that out there.

1808
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:54,020
That being a Jujitsu black belt,

1809
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,470
Brown belt, purple belt, blue belt,

1810
01:45:57,471 --> 01:46:00,350
white belt doesn't make
someone a good person.

1811
01:46:00,860 --> 01:46:05,860
So you need to be careful if you do two
doesn't make you a god and it certainly

1812
01:46:06,471 --> 01:46:07,550
doesn't make you a saint,

1813
01:46:07,640 --> 01:46:12,640
but it does give you power and everybody
has to recognize that there's people

1814
01:46:12,771 --> 01:46:16,400
out there that are,
their goal is to abuse power.

1815
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:23,090
And I think the same thing goes
with any glorified position in life,

1816
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:26,920
you know, and I actually see that
sometimes with, you know, uh, uh,

1817
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:30,620
standing in a company,
a being a veteran,

1818
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:34,520
like being a veteran doesn't mean that
you're a saint by any stretch of the

1819
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:36,740
imagination being a seal.
Right?

1820
01:46:36,741 --> 01:46:38,750
I know a lot of seals and
there's plenty of seals.

1821
01:46:39,110 --> 01:46:43,520
They got out of the seal teams and
they're upstanding awesome citizens.

1822
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:50,140
Mothers also scoundrels and Ms. Green

1823
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:52,050
since swindlers like I said,

1824
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:57,590
and they're using the seal name that they
have to promote themselves and to take

1825
01:46:58,321 --> 01:46:59,850
advantage of other people.
So,

1826
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:00,940
okay,

1827
01:47:00,940 --> 01:47:01,900
keep your guard up,

1828
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:07,440
keep your guard up and make sure you judge
people not based on what Jujitsu belt

1829
01:47:07,811 --> 01:47:08,460
they have.

1830
01:47:08,460 --> 01:47:09,293
Hmm.

1831
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,160
Or what veteran status it
is that they brag about,

1832
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,860
but who they are as a person.

1833
01:47:16,850 --> 01:47:17,000
Okay.

1834
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
And I just wanted to get that out there
because we sit here and talk about

1835
01:47:23,481 --> 01:47:28,480
Jujitsu and there's so many great
people in Jujitsu, man. It's wonderful.

1836
01:47:28,810 --> 01:47:29,920
You roll into some series,

1837
01:47:29,921 --> 01:47:32,500
you see somebody with cauliflower ears
and you start talking to me. It's great.

1838
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:35,500
And you, you, you know, there's
just a bunch of great people.

1839
01:47:35,501 --> 01:47:38,800
I mean we were on the map
today for two hours, you know,

1840
01:47:39,130 --> 01:47:43,120
and we train for an hour and 15 minutes
and they were just hanging out just

1841
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:46,300
talking because that's what we do and
we're talking about everything and it's,

1842
01:47:46,301 --> 01:47:50,030
so there's great people in Jujitsu.
It's a great family,

1843
01:47:50,270 --> 01:47:54,340
a situation.
But you do have to be careful.

1844
01:47:54,550 --> 01:47:57,720
It is not a blanket.
Um,

1845
01:47:59,170 --> 01:47:59,900
okay.

1846
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:04,100
Blanket statement that because someone's
a Jujitsu black belt for instance,

1847
01:48:04,190 --> 01:48:08,410
that they are a trustworthy person cause
there's some scumbags out there. Yeah,

1848
01:48:08,411 --> 01:48:11,510
I'm, and then that's that
can, and the fact that,

1849
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:16,160
and I talked to Brady about this every
once in a while where you go in Jujitsu

1850
01:48:16,161 --> 01:48:19,880
and it seems like everyone just identifies
with each other and later on you find

1851
01:48:19,881 --> 01:48:23,000
out, oh shoot, that guy's like a
lawyer and that guy is a doctor.

1852
01:48:23,001 --> 01:48:27,170
Or that guy's like a different and that
guys or whatever and this person's from

1853
01:48:27,171 --> 01:48:30,650
this area and we all just get along
on the, Yep. Everyone gets along.

1854
01:48:30,651 --> 01:48:32,930
And the black belt,
he has so much like he tell him,

1855
01:48:32,931 --> 01:48:37,360
well like for the most part
it's PR. It's pretty, you know,

1856
01:48:37,460 --> 01:48:41,240
everyone's really good at
Jujitsu for the most part. Right.

1857
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,830
And that's why you can kind of,

1858
01:48:42,831 --> 01:48:45,560
especially if you're kind of new or
maybe like their first year or something

1859
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:48,840
like that, where you're going around
and Dang, my whole year of Jujitsu,

1860
01:48:48,850 --> 01:48:51,330
it's been great. People come
on, the man in the, oh my gosh,

1861
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,640
she's all my new friends.

1862
01:48:52,641 --> 01:48:55,730
That's a big one meant all my new friends
is so cool and I got this whole thing.

1863
01:48:55,731 --> 01:48:57,890
It's like your whole life is better.
And then,

1864
01:48:57,891 --> 01:49:01,010
so your guard is down in the in call,
almost like a conditioning way.

1865
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:05,210
You're just like, hey, if
you're in, did you get two?
You must be dope in every way.

1866
01:49:05,211 --> 01:49:08,780
And then you get these like outliers that
they're in the game, you know, and they,

1867
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:13,790
and they take advantage like there where
they can, you know, and some do, but yeah,

1868
01:49:13,800 --> 01:49:16,210
you gotta, you gotta always
kind of watch over that. Yep.

1869
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:20,240
So just if your spider senses are
going up or first of all, turn them on,

1870
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:22,970
turn them on, turn them
off. And then if they go up,

1871
01:49:22,971 --> 01:49:25,250
start to maybe ask more
questions than you are.

1872
01:49:25,460 --> 01:49:28,370
And don't get yourself in a situation
where you know you're going to regret

1873
01:49:28,371 --> 01:49:32,960
what's going on because you believed that
someone was a good person because they

1874
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:37,150
had some status that you consider
to be an honorable status. Yup.

1875
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:41,090
Hate to say it, man. I hate to, I
hate to have to kind of bring that,

1876
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:44,540
bring all that, all that Jiu Jitsu
down in this, you know, there's,

1877
01:49:44,541 --> 01:49:45,680
and then I'll tell you something else.

1878
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:48,220
There's aspects of
Jujitsu where people lose

1879
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:53,110
their minds, right? They
get crazy. And some of it,

1880
01:49:53,111 --> 01:49:53,351
you know,

1881
01:49:53,351 --> 01:49:56,200
with that whole school thing
we just talked about where
people start going crazy

1882
01:49:56,201 --> 01:50:00,630
about who owns students, right? No.

1883
01:50:00,640 --> 01:50:04,000
Like No.
Like I'm on own in any students.

1884
01:50:04,330 --> 01:50:08,620
I'm happy to have people that train at
my gym and I'm happy to work with them

1885
01:50:08,621 --> 01:50:11,620
and train them. Well, I don't
know, hone anybody. Right.

1886
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,270
And there's people that get that crazy.

1887
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:18,570
There's people that get crazy parents
that goes cycle on their kids and go level

1888
01:50:20,771 --> 01:50:22,210
seven.
You know,

1889
01:50:22,270 --> 01:50:27,190
I'm living vicariously through their
kids and push their kids until the kids

1890
01:50:27,191 --> 01:50:28,900
hate Jujitsu.
And I'll tell you,

1891
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:32,350
I push my kids too hard when they were
younger for sure. That's looking back.

1892
01:50:32,490 --> 01:50:34,960
You know, everyone's, oh, the big
parenting advice from Jocko, man,

1893
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:36,880
I push my kids too hard.
It made them compete too much,

1894
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:38,650
mate who compete in harder brackets.

1895
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:42,190
Older kids have your kids all the
time and it made you did so. Not Fun.

1896
01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:48,280
But I didn't break them
mentally from that.

1897
01:50:49,120 --> 01:50:52,640
So you gotta be careful that you
gotta be careful of the whole. Um,

1898
01:50:52,750 --> 01:50:57,750
you gotta be careful of Jujitsu is a
power and it's really easy to get suckered

1899
01:50:57,941 --> 01:51:01,750
into the point where you feel like you
should exercise your power over other

1900
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:05,770
people, um, on the mats or
otherwise. You know, if you,

1901
01:51:05,771 --> 01:51:10,030
if you ever go into the gym
and it's making you feel
really good to tap everyone

1902
01:51:10,031 --> 01:51:14,140
out, like you're feeling better than
them, just start to check yourself, man.

1903
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:15,303
Because that's not,

1904
01:51:15,310 --> 01:51:19,090
that's not helping you because there's
someone out there that's can tap you.

1905
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:22,540
There's someone else. And if you're
taking those abusives out on other people,

1906
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:27,340
so again, to beginners in Jujitsu,
it's, you're going to get tapped out.

1907
01:51:27,341 --> 01:51:28,360
You're going to get tapped out a lot,

1908
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:34,200
but there shouldn't be anyone that
is smashing you and abusing you.

1909
01:51:34,481 --> 01:51:35,980
That's a much higher belt than you write.

1910
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:38,320
Another white belt might
not even get that yet.

1911
01:51:38,350 --> 01:51:40,360
They're just happy they're submitting you.
Right?

1912
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:43,840
But when anyone that's been around
a little bit more, they should be,

1913
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:47,500
you should feel like, hey, that guy just,

1914
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:51,820
he didn't abuse me. Yeah.
She didn't abuse me.

1915
01:51:51,880 --> 01:51:54,730
She just beat me and I know
what happened and it's cool.

1916
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:58,030
Hmm. Yeah. In, in even that,

1917
01:51:58,060 --> 01:52:02,740
that's kind of weird and interesting too
where abuse can come in weird different

1918
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:07,340
forms to, you know, like if cause
there's a difference. Okay. So,

1919
01:52:07,350 --> 01:52:09,310
so like Jeff Glover for example,
if you,

1920
01:52:09,311 --> 01:52:13,570
if Jeff Bavor is cause he has fun when
he rolls, that's a big part of his game.

1921
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:16,810
And um, let's say, Oh, I'm a
new white belt, maybe, you know,

1922
01:52:17,110 --> 01:52:19,390
and I come my role against
Jeff Glover and heat and it's,

1923
01:52:19,391 --> 01:52:24,391
let's say it's I a six minute round and
just in training in Jeff taps him out 25

1924
01:52:24,941 --> 01:52:29,430
times. That's not, that's not
abuse. You know, you're just,

1925
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:32,140
you're just doing some missions whole on
you. He's doing his thing or whatever.

1926
01:52:32,141 --> 01:52:34,990
If someone's like grinding
you and in doing, you know,

1927
01:52:34,991 --> 01:52:38,500
abusing you or trying to make you look
stupid or something like that because

1928
01:52:38,501 --> 01:52:40,600
like, oh yeah, I know dude, you
see you don't kind of thing.

1929
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:42,060
Or maybe there's some girls
that he's trying to pro,

1930
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:45,550
then that starts to get into music.
But I

1931
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:50,270
don't ever watch me and dean role because
when one of us is having a good day

1932
01:52:50,271 --> 01:52:53,120
and the other one's having a bad day,
it's straight up abusive.

1933
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:54,210
But that's you and dean.

1934
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,730
And you'll notice that if when you
established like solid training partners,

1935
01:52:58,760 --> 01:53:01,490
then that becomes part of the game.
I'm going to try to abuse you.

1936
01:53:01,730 --> 01:53:03,170
And so that's different.

1937
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,920
That's what I mean by like dynamic as
far as like we're recognizing what abuse

1938
01:53:09,231 --> 01:53:12,710
is because if you get tapped out 25
times in the, it seems like, Dang,

1939
01:53:12,711 --> 01:53:17,390
you didn't have to like go black belt on
him. He's a light bulb. Well, well, yeah,

1940
01:53:17,391 --> 01:53:19,970
he went black belt on him, but he wasn't
abusing them. You know what I mean?

1941
01:53:19,971 --> 01:53:23,630
That's like that. That's a well within
the confines of the game. For sure.

1942
01:53:23,690 --> 01:53:25,050
For sure.
There's a big difference between that.

1943
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:29,990
I know this to translate this for
people that don't do Jujitsu yet. Uh,

1944
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:34,910
think about also this with
any status structure, right?

1945
01:53:34,990 --> 01:53:37,820
In the work, in the military, in,

1946
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:42,970
in the hierarchy of any
company or industry where
if you're feeling good about

1947
01:53:45,321 --> 01:53:49,400
bossing people around, you're
doing something wrong, man,

1948
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:52,430
you're doing something wrong.
If your goal

1949
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:57,650
of what you're doing is based on you,

1950
01:53:58,370 --> 01:53:59,780
if you're saying,
look,

1951
01:53:59,870 --> 01:54:04,790
I'm going to be the best and I'm gonna be,

1952
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:10,670
this is what's important to me. Yeah. If
that's what you're saying is a leader,

1953
01:54:11,330 --> 01:54:16,040
put yourself in check because that's just
pure ego coming out when you're saying,

1954
01:54:16,041 --> 01:54:18,590
look,
I want to be the best in this.

1955
01:54:18,740 --> 01:54:22,040
And I think there's a weird thing that
happens with people that are go getters

1956
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:25,610
and they hear someone that's a go getter
that we'll hear some person that's been

1957
01:54:25,611 --> 01:54:28,160
successful in business and that person
that's been successful in business will

1958
01:54:28,161 --> 01:54:28,994
be like,
you know what?

1959
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:32,390
I said I was going to be the
best and here I am on the best.

1960
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:33,590
And you've got to set your goals,

1961
01:54:33,591 --> 01:54:35,820
you've got to put 'em out there and you
got to let everyone know that you're

1962
01:54:35,821 --> 01:54:38,840
going to run them over if you're getting
your way. And that sounds really cool.

1963
01:54:39,800 --> 01:54:40,220
And,

1964
01:54:40,220 --> 01:54:45,220
and I guarantee if you went back and
you follow that person through their

1965
01:54:45,501 --> 01:54:49,010
career, they were completely
not like that. They were,

1966
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:53,540
they were politically sensitive.
They understood other people's needs.

1967
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:56,810
They didn't go, Hey, nice to meet you.
I'm going to take over this business. No,

1968
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:58,910
they didn't do that. They said, hey,
nice to meet you. How are you doing?

1969
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:00,710
What are you,
what are we trying to make happen here?

1970
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:05,210
They made it a goal for the team. Even
if the deep underlying goal is, uh,

1971
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:06,830
is a selfish one,

1972
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:11,330
let's say the outer
goal should not be that.

1973
01:55:11,360 --> 01:55:14,090
It should not be, hey,
I'm going to be the best.

1974
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:17,780
I'm going to be the ruler of this
company. I'm going to be, no,

1975
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:21,500
we don't want to hear that. Like when
you, you, you know, I just take all,

1976
01:55:21,501 --> 01:55:25,070
I want to be the president of the United
States who wants that person to be

1977
01:55:25,071 --> 01:55:26,870
present,
the United States and I sure don't,

1978
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:30,410
I don't want that person to be president.
I would say it's if someone says,

1979
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:35,810
I'm going to be the CEO of this company
now, what do you think of that? You think,

1980
01:55:35,811 --> 01:55:40,110
okay, so this person's ego is really,
really big and do you think yourself,

1981
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:44,100
you know what, that I don't like that.
You need to put that. So if that's your

1982
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:46,470
attitude and you think
you're being fired up,

1983
01:55:46,830 --> 01:55:49,440
keep that goal internal.

1984
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:51,890
Don't be announcing that gold blue side.

1985
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:54,840
State your goals and let the
world know you're here. No,

1986
01:55:55,590 --> 01:56:00,180
because you sound like an egomaniac.
What you should say is like,

1987
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:01,710
you know what I want to
do with this company?

1988
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:05,730
I want to help this company
grow the best I can.

1989
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,430
And you know what's important to be
about being in a leadership position?

1990
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:11,280
What's important to me about being in a
leadership position is making sure that

1991
01:56:11,281 --> 01:56:15,900
the people underneath me, they get
better and they reach their goals.

1992
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:17,760
This isn't about me.

1993
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:23,340
This is about the people that are on my
team and I want to make them successful.

1994
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:28,440
Now, who wants to work for that person?
I do sign me up. But when I say,

1995
01:56:28,470 --> 01:56:31,000
Hey boss, nighttime, nice to meet
you, what's your, you know what,

1996
01:56:31,001 --> 01:56:35,460
what's your goal here at the company?
My goal is to be CEO, to be the boss.

1997
01:56:35,461 --> 01:56:38,010
So you're going to step on my
back to get their sounds like fun.

1998
01:56:38,370 --> 01:56:41,640
Don't sign me up for that guy.
I don't want to work with that person.

1999
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:45,540
I want to work with somebody that's about
the team and I don't want to work with

2000
01:56:45,541 --> 01:56:47,520
somebody that's gonna be abusive,
just like I don't want to train it.

2001
01:56:47,521 --> 01:56:51,780
Anybody's Jujitsu Academy that's going
to have that abusive mentality and

2002
01:56:51,781 --> 01:56:56,070
they're out there. So I wanted to tie
that back into the business world.

2003
01:56:56,530 --> 01:57:00,150
The instructor, I'm the
instructor. Your instructor,

2004
01:57:00,151 --> 01:57:03,570
you don't go into Napoleon dynamite,
you know bout your sensei.

2005
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:07,450
They make fun of that. And
it's funny and, and there's,

2006
01:57:07,590 --> 01:57:08,790
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with that.

2007
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:10,980
There's a lot of tradition
in Jujitsu as well. You know,

2008
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:14,300
you bow to your instructor, you now
when you come on and off the mat. Yeah,

2009
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:19,030
I'm not super into that stuff. You know
what I mean? I'm laid back. I know I'm,

2010
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:21,930
I'm pretty laid back when it comes
to the Jujitsu traditions. Yeah.

2011
01:57:21,931 --> 01:57:25,350
Most of the bowing to the instructor
in Jujitsu is more like bar.

2012
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:29,620
It's like bow to Jujitsu almost like
and not foul like bow down. It's more D,

2013
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:32,940
it's like show respect. Like if you
go to even more traditional schools,

2014
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:35,900
even when Rhonda was teaching
at our school, you know,

2015
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:39,580
you buy it to all of the
instructors because they're
the ones providing that you

2016
01:57:39,581 --> 01:57:43,000
do. And then you bought it Helio Gracie
cause he's the one who kind of provide,

2017
01:57:43,140 --> 01:57:45,370
you know, so it was more
about that. You did too. Yeah.

2018
01:57:46,950 --> 01:57:49,500
It doesn't have that feel and you've
got to make sure that you're not getting

2019
01:57:49,501 --> 01:57:54,330
that crossover where it goes from,
hey bow to Jujitsu and flavor.

2020
01:57:54,350 --> 01:57:58,060
Pay respect to a beautiful
thing to bow to me. Yes.

2021
01:57:58,170 --> 01:58:00,990
And it's the same thing in the
business world. If you're saying, look,

2022
01:58:01,380 --> 01:58:04,980
there's nothing wrong with treating your
CEO with respect and your CEO should be

2023
01:58:04,981 --> 01:58:07,810
treated with respect or your boss,
you treat your bothers with respect.

2024
01:58:07,830 --> 01:58:11,340
Absolutely. Like, Hey boss,
what do you need me to do?
Hey, hey sir, in the military,

2025
01:58:11,341 --> 01:58:14,850
you know, you call those senior officers,
sir. There there's, there's nothing,

2026
01:58:14,851 --> 01:58:17,910
you know, shouldn't feel
degraded by doing that. But

2027
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:24,210
if for instance, in the military,
if it's like, hey, you call me sir,

2028
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:28,470
you know, okay, I see what I'm dealing
with here in the, in the business world,

2029
01:58:28,740 --> 01:58:31,290
if people are,
you know,

2030
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:34,260
if you as an individual are thinking,

2031
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:38,520
you better show me the respect I deserve.
You got issues,

2032
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:42,670
I got issues. You got to earn that. If
someone's not giving you the SPEC, don't,

2033
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:44,410
don't look at them and demand it.
Yeah.

2034
01:58:44,620 --> 01:58:49,620
Look at yourself and demand that you
become a better leader where they give you

2035
01:58:49,631 --> 01:58:54,210
the respect, not because you asked for
it, but because you deserved it. Yeah.

2036
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:57,700
There's a big difference. That's
funny man. Give me the respect.

2037
01:58:57,701 --> 01:58:59,370
I deserve to have them either respect

2038
01:58:59,710 --> 01:59:03,160
most of the time, most not all of them.
Most of them. Once someone says yes,

2039
01:59:03,190 --> 01:59:04,840
give me the respect, idea, deserve.

2040
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:08,710
It's when they are being given the respect
they deserve, which is probably not.

2041
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:12,400
Most of the time when people are saying,
give me the respect I deserve,

2042
01:59:12,401 --> 01:59:15,120
they don't deserve the
respect they're asking for me.

2043
01:59:15,210 --> 01:59:19,440
Yeah, they need to get their
head together. Awesome.

2044
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:23,100
What are we got time for?
One more. That's one. Jocko,

2045
01:59:23,910 --> 01:59:26,790
I had had a few rough months,

2046
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:31,740
some setbacks at work that
hurt me financially, which
is stressed out. My family,

2047
01:59:31,950 --> 01:59:35,370
I'm late on some payments.
I'm falling further behind at work.

2048
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:39,840
I don't want to tap out,
but I just don't know where to start.

2049
01:59:41,060 --> 01:59:43,940
Well, you know what, that's,

2050
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:50,540
that's just kind of the way that
life works.

2051
01:59:50,720 --> 01:59:52,790
Sometimes it's Murphy's law.

2052
01:59:53,630 --> 01:59:56,030
When things go wrong,

2053
01:59:56,450 --> 02:00:01,450
they always seem to happen at once and
they just compound on top of each other

2054
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:04,730
and it's,

2055
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:10,930
it's pretty easy sometimes to to feel
beaten when you're faced with all those

2056
02:00:12,531 --> 02:00:16,190
issues and all those problems and
they all hit you at the same time.

2057
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:18,403
But

2058
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:24,520
let me tell you that that
doesn't mean give up.

2059
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:29,710
In fact,
it means the opposite.

2060
02:00:31,280 --> 02:00:36,280
It means it's time for you to fight harder
to dig in means it's time for you to

2061
02:00:38,601 --> 02:00:39,950
go on the warpath

2062
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:47,420
and that starts with one of the
fundamental laws of combat leadership.

2063
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,530
Prioritize and execute. What's
the biggest problem? Well,

2064
02:00:52,531 --> 02:00:56,520
what's causing the most
stress? Family. Okay.

2065
02:00:57,090 --> 02:01:01,470
Sit them down.
Explain where you are at.

2066
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:04,290
Be Blunt,
be up front,

2067
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:09,920
and then give them the simple plan of
how you're going to get things back on

2068
02:01:10,351 --> 02:01:12,690
track.
Don't sugarcoat it.

2069
02:01:14,570 --> 02:01:18,230
You give it to them straight.
Next you got some,

2070
02:01:19,010 --> 02:01:23,480
some late payments.
Call those creditors up.

2071
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:27,450
Explain to them what's going on.
Set up some kind of a of a,

2072
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:32,500
of a minimum payment plan so you can start
making some progress and get them off

2073
02:01:33,291 --> 02:01:36,290
your back.
And then you got your job

2074
02:01:38,270 --> 02:01:42,500
right, your phone at work.
Okay? Talk to your boss.

2075
02:01:43,430 --> 02:01:47,540
Face it. Tell him that you're
going to step up your game.

2076
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:50,960
Tell him you're going to be at work early.
You're going to be at work late.

2077
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:52,460
You're going to be at work during lunch.

2078
02:01:52,490 --> 02:01:56,840
You're going to be wherever you need to
be whenever he needs you to be there.

2079
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:03,770
Tell him you're going to get after it and
tell him that you were 100% committed.

2080
02:02:05,290 --> 02:02:05,790
Yeah.

2081
02:02:05,790 --> 02:02:10,440
Tufts supporting him and
the company and the mission.

2082
02:02:14,030 --> 02:02:16,370
And then you get started.

2083
02:02:18,460 --> 02:02:21,490
And I'm going to tell you right now,
it won't be easy.

2084
02:02:22,690 --> 02:02:27,550
It will be hard because life is hard.
That's what life is.

2085
02:02:29,970 --> 02:02:34,920
And these challenges,
these challenges that you face,

2086
02:02:35,970 --> 02:02:39,720
they're going to do their
best to take you down.

2087
02:02:43,790 --> 02:02:48,560
Do not let them stand up.
Dig In.

2088
02:02:49,370 --> 02:02:49,910
Okay.

2089
02:02:49,910 --> 02:02:54,000
Line up those problems and confront them.
Face them,

2090
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:55,493
fight them.

2091
02:02:57,070 --> 02:03:01,030
Do not let them bring you down.
In fact,

2092
02:03:02,740 --> 02:03:06,160
in fact,
let lose challenges.

2093
02:03:07,120 --> 02:03:10,030
Raise you up.
Let them elevate you.

2094
02:03:10,990 --> 02:03:11,540
Yeah.

2095
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:16,430
Let their demands and their
trials make you stronger.

2096
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:22,210
Let the adversity you face today,

2097
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:23,770
okay.

2098
02:03:23,770 --> 02:03:26,440
Turn you into a better person tomorrow.

2099
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:31,520
So,
so when the future,

2100
02:03:33,330 --> 02:03:38,280
you look back at these
struggles heg you say to them,

2101
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:40,863
thank you.

2102
02:03:42,570 --> 02:03:45,120
You made me better.

2103
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:56,400
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2104
02:03:59,220 --> 02:04:03,450
So echo
let's cloves it on out.

2105
02:04:03,930 --> 02:04:07,920
How can everyone get on board with
the program here and, and sport?

2106
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:13,430
The little podcast we got
going in enforcement, not
reinforcement. Reinforcement.

2107
02:04:13,560 --> 02:04:16,560
Yes.
So indeed few ways.

2108
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:21,780
First on top of supporting this podcast
and you're going to want to support

2109
02:04:21,781 --> 02:04:26,550
yourself, I think supplementation.
Why don't we talk about this?

2110
02:04:26,551 --> 02:04:30,840
I know, I know. Um, anyway, on
it has the best supplements.

2111
02:04:30,841 --> 02:04:33,470
We all know this.
Krill oil dot.

2112
02:04:33,471 --> 02:04:38,100
My krill oil in echoes in
the game. Actually I'm, I'm

2113
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,610
staying on it every month anyway.

2114
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:46,560
So on it on a.com/jocko 10% off.
So supplement your wallet as well.

2115
02:04:47,130 --> 02:04:50,100
So the Krill oil, that's for
your joints warrior bars as well.

2116
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:55,410
I think Donald's a good
one. Yes. Room Tech.

2117
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:59,850
Shroom tech is kind of, okay. So
victor was talking about, he's like,

2118
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:04,520
I'm on shroom tech today,
all fired up yet.

2119
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:06,150
So tell me what you think about this.

2120
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:11,310
So I used to take shroom tech all
the time and be like, and I felt,

2121
02:05:11,370 --> 02:05:14,910
and I felt like it kind of gave me an
advantage because you know how cardio

2122
02:05:14,911 --> 02:05:18,270
conditioning stuff is a tool in
Jujitsu or can be if you use it.

2123
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:23,400
Do you think that's an advantage?
Do, I think cardio has an advantage.

2124
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:26,190
[inaudible] tech is like all he took.

2125
02:05:26,191 --> 02:05:29,700
Shroom tech doesn't count because
I took shrooms deck and tapped out.

2126
02:05:29,701 --> 02:05:32,250
Someone who I don't tap up. There's,
there's two ways to look at that.

2127
02:05:32,290 --> 02:05:34,380
Well that's a word.
Shroom tech is really good.

2128
02:05:34,450 --> 02:05:38,970
Shroom tech did not make you tap out,
tapped out, but indirectly it could have,

2129
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,830
you know what I mean?
So I guess,

2130
02:05:40,831 --> 02:05:45,660
I guess the answer to this would be since
you were able with shroom tech to do

2131
02:05:45,661 --> 02:05:50,610
more, it's pushing you harder so you're
stepping up your game overall. Yeah,

2132
02:05:50,611 --> 02:05:54,090
I'm allowed to train better because you
can train harder because of your shroom

2133
02:05:54,091 --> 02:05:57,390
tech. Yeah. So it is,
as far as I'm concerned,

2134
02:05:57,870 --> 02:06:00,240
permissible to do that because you're
just trying to get yourself better and

2135
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:05,100
[inaudible] helps you do that. Now you
might have to, you know, give a caveat,

2136
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:08,350
put us little asterisks next to
your tap house on the shroom tech.

2137
02:06:08,351 --> 02:06:13,170
So quite there. That's like a wind
ATM today. When we got done training,

2138
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:17,130
I was like, you know, I didn't take any
shroom tech today. So maybe you know,

2139
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:19,110
and you were like, I either
did I, so I said okay.

2140
02:06:19,140 --> 02:06:22,040
It was a level playing field
in Stephen. Yeah, the, the um,

2141
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:25,740
it's like when you run the hundred
meter dash in the wind, the sun,

2142
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,350
there's a strong wind like you'll,
you'll get the record,

2143
02:06:28,351 --> 02:06:32,440
but there's a star there asked her,
he says wind dated record. Oh really?

2144
02:06:32,441 --> 02:06:35,300
This is wind aided? Yes. Still your
record. But it's the wind ate. It sort of,

2145
02:06:35,301 --> 02:06:37,830
I know is that they try and
do you like Yo when you're,

2146
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:42,150
when you get your shroom tech and you set
your PR in, you know, in like, you know,

2147
02:06:42,151 --> 02:06:46,710
a wad or something like this. You
got to put the star. There's no PR,

2148
02:06:46,711 --> 02:06:51,390
but I was on a shoot. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe
you don't have to do valid and do that.

2149
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:55,950
Maybe, I don't know. But you might anyway.
Nonetheless, shroom tech sport though.

2150
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:57,210
There's two,
this shroom tech.

2151
02:06:58,690 --> 02:07:03,370
It's the shroom tech something
else. I'm talking about this. Yes.

2152
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:09,320
Yeah. Luckily I haven't had to
take the immune. Yeah. But no,

2153
02:07:09,350 --> 02:07:12,870
that's for general immunity. Right.
That's so close to the thing. But anyway,

2154
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:17,100
that one, probably not a peak
performance enhancing supplement.

2155
02:07:17,940 --> 02:07:21,540
Maybe it is indirectly anyway on
it. Uh, it's there from audit.

2156
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:26,750
You get 10% off on a.com/jocko take the
Alpha brain to think a little better.

2157
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:31,090
Like it makes you think it's proven.
By the way that St lie,

2158
02:07:31,091 --> 02:07:33,720
it's legitimately proved.
Not like the 19%.

2159
02:07:34,530 --> 02:07:38,560
The 90% is pretty legitimately
through as far as I know. Cole Miller,

2160
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,660
Colt meal there, UFC fighter Mike
Best. I mean I got an email today,

2161
02:07:43,690 --> 02:07:47,560
got his rash guard, uh, just
started Jujitsu like, you know,

2162
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:52,030
a lot of us have been and so emails me
and says I was going to bring the email

2163
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:55,270
and read it. It's short. So he's
like, um, he's like, hey man,

2164
02:07:56,120 --> 02:07:58,810
I tapped out my Jujitsu attorneys.
Quite awesome.

2165
02:07:59,500 --> 02:08:03,460
I tapped out my first blue
belt today. Dang. And he said,

2166
02:08:03,580 --> 02:08:06,790
guess what I was wearing?
He said,

2167
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:10,990
I'm not going to attribute it to the
rash guard specifically, but let's,

2168
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:14,830
let's face it. It was the rash
guard. Okay. So that being said,

2169
02:08:15,790 --> 02:08:20,790
there's some super rash guards on Jocko
store.com I redid the website by the

2170
02:08:21,551 --> 02:08:25,870
way. Not much in effect. It's
just kind of redone nonetheless.

2171
02:08:26,590 --> 02:08:30,370
This rash guards on there, they're
cool. They improve your performance.

2172
02:08:30,371 --> 02:08:32,740
19% tech I guess.

2173
02:08:32,750 --> 02:08:36,010
I mean apparently 19 to 35% really?

2174
02:08:36,011 --> 02:08:40,810
That's the range evidently. Anyway. Cool.
Rash guards. You can check those out.

2175
02:08:40,870 --> 02:08:43,750
[inaudible] dot com there's
some shirts there too.

2176
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:49,000
Was that you telling me that
you saw someone with a shirt
on? None. No, no victor.

2177
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:49,834
Victor was saying,

2178
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:54,040
oh paid above the so
that's the thing when we,

2179
02:08:54,041 --> 02:08:56,830
and I said this before of course.
So you know if you listen,

2180
02:08:56,860 --> 02:09:00,520
you know that I try to put more than
just the one layer on the shirt.

2181
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:02,440
It's kind of,
there's a bunch of insights stuff.

2182
02:09:02,460 --> 02:09:04,840
Actually if you talking about
the layers on the shirts,

2183
02:09:04,841 --> 02:09:08,800
it started to become a thing I'm
telling. No, I'm saying cause it,

2184
02:09:08,890 --> 02:09:11,620
you know why it's starting to become
thing cause it cause it is a thing.

2185
02:09:12,370 --> 02:09:14,770
So you're going to have to
like on some future shirt,

2186
02:09:14,771 --> 02:09:18,720
you'd have to actually put
the word layers. Layers. Yeah.

2187
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:21,460
It might be don't either way.

2188
02:09:21,461 --> 02:09:26,461
He was saying how he recognized the shirt
and when you see someone else wearing

2189
02:09:27,131 --> 02:09:28,400
like, you know, they, you know,

2190
02:09:28,770 --> 02:09:32,140
so it's not like you see a quick
silver shirt and it's like, Hey,

2191
02:09:32,141 --> 02:09:35,590
I'm wearing critters. You know what I
mean? It's different. It's way different.

2192
02:09:36,070 --> 02:09:40,180
This stuff, you know, if you
listen, you know, you're like,
ah, anyway, check them out.

2193
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:40,830
If you like,

2194
02:09:40,830 --> 02:09:45,730
go grab one and you can support that
way and force and then Amazon click

2195
02:09:45,731 --> 02:09:49,810
through. What that it does is
anytime you shop on Amazon,

2196
02:09:49,811 --> 02:09:53,620
just clicked through on our website,
Jocko, podcast.com or the store.

2197
02:09:53,621 --> 02:09:55,420
There's a little section there.
Uh,

2198
02:09:55,810 --> 02:09:59,920
people can do a lot of Christmas
and holiday shopping. Yeah.

2199
02:09:59,921 --> 02:10:04,420
So if you really want to get your
support on the game full speed,

2200
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:09,880
it doesn't cost anybody
anything, doesn't, it's,

2201
02:10:09,940 --> 02:10:12,790
it's just supports the podcast while
you're doing your normal stuff.

2202
02:10:12,791 --> 02:10:15,970
So that's awesome. That is
appreciated. Yeah, man, it gets,

2203
02:10:15,971 --> 02:10:19,840
I mean the key there really is to remember
to click through before you go shop.

2204
02:10:19,841 --> 02:10:24,040
That's it. Anyway. It's a good way
to support them as on, so yeah,

2205
02:10:24,041 --> 02:10:27,040
on the website again, you just click on
the Amazon link before you do shopping,

2206
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:31,800
then boom, support, actively,
efficiently, solid. Um,

2207
02:10:31,810 --> 02:10:33,770
and then of course subscribe

2208
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:37,550
on the, uh, on Itunes, on
the iTunes or stitcher.

2209
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:42,890
And there's some other like
Google play, Google play. Oh yeah,

2210
02:10:42,891 --> 02:10:45,920
that's a good one too. Those little
podcasts, layups, but yet be a subscriber.

2211
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:48,440
Men in the game,
straight up.

2212
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:53,330
Write a review on the, maybe this
is, I don't know what this is.

2213
02:10:53,990 --> 02:10:58,670
It's just one of those things. We're
at like 900 something reviews. Oh yeah.

2214
02:10:58,710 --> 02:10:59,543
So of course

2215
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:05,990
I'm going to go home and write a hundred
reviews tonight myself and get to a

2216
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:09,470
thousand,
a thousand,

2217
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:14,060
a thousand reviews even mean.
I know what's good about it is it is.

2218
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:16,010
If you wrote a review,
I read it.

2219
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:20,060
I've read all the reviews that are on
there and it's cool because it's good

2220
02:11:20,061 --> 02:11:25,061
feedback and it lets us know that people
are listening and that they're in the

2221
02:11:25,881 --> 02:11:29,730
game. Yeah. Which is cool.
That is plenty of them.

2222
02:11:29,731 --> 02:11:32,580
And I want to get to a thousand
for no good. Of course,

2223
02:11:32,600 --> 02:11:37,520
when he does that ego you
think or maybe OCD or both?

2224
02:11:37,550 --> 02:11:39,140
Cause you know how like
you're like, hey, I don't,

2225
02:11:39,141 --> 02:11:41,750
you know how like when you pump the
gas, you know, and you're like, oh,

2226
02:11:41,751 --> 02:11:43,850
I'm going to, I'm gonna get, if
you're not filling up, you're like,

2227
02:11:43,851 --> 02:11:48,010
I'm going to get it right on
the $20 market. It's like,
it's a weird thing. Anyway,

2228
02:11:48,280 --> 02:11:52,220
something like that. Um, you know how like
people, they'll celebrate, hey, I got to,

2229
02:11:52,221 --> 02:11:55,520
you know, a thousand subscribers
or whatever. You know, people,

2230
02:11:55,521 --> 02:11:58,310
they'll celebrate in the upload,
sit and be like, well, like,

2231
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:02,630
why didn't you celebrate at like
1,001 or nine, eight, nine. See,

2232
02:12:02,631 --> 02:12:05,000
when I get to a thousand I won't
celebrate anything. I'll be like,

2233
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:09,170
I need to get to 2000 and it's not even
anything I can stop from my own brain

2234
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:13,190
thinking. He just thinks that
way. So yeah. So your thing
is like different. Yeah,

2235
02:12:13,191 --> 02:12:16,070
just like it's a,
it's almost like a score and I go,

2236
02:12:16,071 --> 02:12:19,600
oh well what's my score right now?
Right now it's 920 to three yeah.

2237
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:22,970
I want my score to be a thousand.
Why? I have no good reason. And you

2238
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:27,660
yet nonetheless subscribe.

2239
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:31,580
That's how you can support
and youtube subscribe to that.

2240
02:12:31,610 --> 02:12:34,340
You know if you're down, if you're
in to youtube and watching videos,

2241
02:12:35,090 --> 02:12:36,080
I'm subscribed to that.

2242
02:12:36,230 --> 02:12:38,930
I think I'm going to put out
another one here pretty soon. Yeah,

2243
02:12:38,931 --> 02:12:42,220
we hear that Queen Bee are going to
put on another one. We hear that a lot,

2244
02:12:42,630 --> 02:12:46,570
you know? Hey, it kind of like the email
lists. You know how like, oh, okay,

2245
02:12:46,600 --> 02:12:48,890
I'll talk about in a second.
But you don't like the email list?

2246
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:52,550
We have you sign up the insider's list
and just sign up and be like, Hey,

2247
02:12:52,551 --> 02:12:54,680
I'll send you, you know some,
we'll send you some stuff.

2248
02:12:55,770 --> 02:12:59,000
I'm not going to send you stuff every day.
I'm just kind of like the youtube, Hey,

2249
02:12:59,001 --> 02:13:01,580
I'm going to put more videos.
Maybe not every week,

2250
02:13:01,581 --> 02:13:03,350
but you know there will be more,

2251
02:13:03,390 --> 02:13:08,120
more than basically any.
Meanwhile on my end,

2252
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:13,550
people are like, Hey Jocko, keep making
a podcast every week. I say your end,

2253
02:13:14,060 --> 02:13:16,340
they tell you, hey echo, can you make
some more videos? And you're like,

2254
02:13:16,520 --> 02:13:19,720
you know what? They
can, they can wait low.

2255
02:13:20,850 --> 02:13:24,990
That's the artist in you.
No, no, no. That's nice. The
artists right there. I'll,

2256
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:27,470
yeah,
we'll do some more videos.

2257
02:13:28,130 --> 02:13:32,070
I would hope that we're all
sitting here holding our breath.

2258
02:13:32,280 --> 02:13:34,070
Their Echo Charles for you
to make more than, yeah,

2259
02:13:34,210 --> 02:13:36,410
I see what you're doing. He gives
you like stroking my ego. Like,

2260
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:39,630
oh we're waiting for your next video,
but I'm like,

2261
02:13:39,631 --> 02:13:42,190
you guys are waiting from wavy. I'm
going to put on the video, be like, yes,

2262
02:13:42,191 --> 02:13:43,780
I want to my video guys,

2263
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:47,220
have you ever made, have you ever made
a video that you got done and you said,

2264
02:13:47,221 --> 02:13:49,140
I'm not even going to release
this thing cause it's too bad.

2265
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:51,650
Yes, I have a whole series. Yeah.

2266
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:57,680
Echo telling you bro. It's, yeah,
there's like one of them's called, um,

2267
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:01,070
for people that you find on
Facebook and like cone ends in it.

2268
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:04,100
It's like the people who take p one of
them is like two people who take pictures

2269
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:08,630
of themself, but they want to act like
they're taking a picture of something,

2270
02:14:08,660 --> 02:14:09,493
you know?
But it's like,

2271
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:14,330
it's like this thing and it just didn't
come out good anyway. Nonetheless. Yeah.

2272
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:18,740
I am very weary of these things
anyway, so yeah. Support that way. Oh,

2273
02:14:18,741 --> 02:14:21,470
back to the store. Jocko store.
Oh, there's some new stuff.

2274
02:14:21,860 --> 02:14:26,180
Is it annoying to sit here and talk
about like this stuff right here? Um,

2275
02:14:26,860 --> 02:14:29,900
no, I don't think so. I mean, if,

2276
02:14:30,440 --> 02:14:35,030
if I didn't have Debbie and everyone's
saying, well, where's the girl stuff?

2277
02:14:35,780 --> 02:14:38,530
You know, and they're just like,
all right. You know, like not

2278
02:14:39,490 --> 02:14:42,250
maybe just so I think about it
like, I always think like, okay,

2279
02:14:42,310 --> 02:14:44,860
we can probably cut this, you know,
hey, let's just run through, you know,

2280
02:14:44,861 --> 02:14:47,380
how to support the podcast. Did you
take three minutes? For some reason?

2281
02:14:47,381 --> 02:14:51,220
It turns into a 15 minute conversation
and I don't, I don't, it's,

2282
02:14:51,221 --> 02:14:54,280
I never intend to do that.
And then when I listened to it,

2283
02:14:54,310 --> 02:14:56,620
I actually laugh at most of it
and I think it's pretty funny.

2284
02:14:56,740 --> 02:15:00,720
So I don't even know.
We should do like a two hour podcast.

2285
02:15:00,730 --> 02:15:04,060
I'll us just talking about how to support
the podcast because it might be pretty

2286
02:15:04,061 --> 02:15:05,440
funny cause you're laughing right now.

2287
02:15:05,530 --> 02:15:08,770
I was laughing a second ago and maybe
that'd be the greatest topic ever.

2288
02:15:08,910 --> 02:15:12,360
Okay. So in that regard, I,
I'm not saying this is proof,

2289
02:15:12,361 --> 02:15:15,930
but this evidence and this happened
more than once by the way. So

2290
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:19,330
you know that we'll
order a shirt and yeah,

2291
02:15:19,331 --> 02:15:22,270
it's online so you can't try on the
shirts. So people will be like, Hey,

2292
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:25,350
well you know, what's the shirt sizes
or whatever. And they'll say, hey,

2293
02:15:25,351 --> 02:15:28,710
I need a bigger size,
or I don't know,

2294
02:15:28,711 --> 02:15:31,720
I def forgot to change my address
or something where, you know, they,

2295
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:36,450
they require it another shirt. Yeah.
So there'd be times I'd be like, oh,

2296
02:15:36,451 --> 02:15:39,740
I'll just send it to you. Like you
got lost in the mail, whatever.

2297
02:15:39,810 --> 02:15:43,470
I'll just send it so it just
send it and they're like,
no, no I do. Oh No, no. Here,

2298
02:15:43,500 --> 02:15:45,980
this is what it was two. And that
happened before. But here's, there's,

2299
02:15:45,981 --> 02:15:47,490
here's a very specific
one I'm thinking about.

2300
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:50,820
It's where I sent apparently two shirts.

2301
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:54,140
They got two shirts they were supposed
to get. One was supposed to get Wonka.

2302
02:15:54,170 --> 02:15:56,520
Yeah. And they were
like, I got two shirts,

2303
02:15:56,521 --> 02:16:00,240
I'm keeping him tell me where
to pay. Tell me like, tell him,

2304
02:16:00,241 --> 02:16:02,790
tell me how I can pay, cause he
can't go and click another, you know,

2305
02:16:02,791 --> 02:16:04,940
it'll go in the order says that. And he
was told where I can pay. I was like, no,

2306
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:08,130
I keep the shirt. That's all
you, you know, give it to
somebody. And they're like,

2307
02:16:08,131 --> 02:16:12,480
I demand to pay. It's like part of the
reason is to support this, the podcast,

2308
02:16:12,481 --> 02:16:16,230
you know, so, and I'm Kinda like, Dang,

2309
02:16:18,570 --> 02:16:23,570
there are enforcements out there
who embrace the reinforcing.

2310
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:27,480
That's why.
That's why I think this is relevant.

2311
02:16:27,650 --> 02:16:30,130
Well, yeah. Well, I guess my is, is

2312
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,290
that when you were
talking about this stuff,

2313
02:16:32,530 --> 02:16:35,740
what should be a 32nd thing?

2314
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:37,690
Turns into a 15 minute thing.

2315
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:42,750
Light gets happening right now and when
I listened to the podcast and I'll start

2316
02:16:43,571 --> 02:16:44,890
going, oh, here come the advertisements.

2317
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:49,570
I got to make a note to say shorten these
down. And then I say, Oh you know what?

2318
02:16:49,571 --> 02:16:53,780
That was actually funny as
hell. So I dunno, maybe I'm,

2319
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:58,260
maybe I'm just ultra sensitive. Yeah.
Maybe just like the ritual thing. Mm.

2320
02:16:59,230 --> 02:17:03,070
Maybe dug in. So what were you saying?
The store? Yeah, the store. Hey there's,

2321
02:17:03,071 --> 02:17:06,970
there's some new stuff is the
first time I'm saying it publicly,

2322
02:17:06,971 --> 02:17:09,430
but there's hoodies in there.
They're pretty cool.

2323
02:17:09,760 --> 02:17:14,050
Apparently Jocko says,
oh good. I like them.

2324
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:17,410
I'm also like, I'd did the
patches. Where there, there Ft.

2325
02:17:17,411 --> 02:17:20,710
You know how j p last week
said federal dark earth.

2326
02:17:22,210 --> 02:17:23,830
Apparently it's flat.
Darker.

2327
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:28,540
Not to be confused with flat
earth cause people won't.

2328
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:32,230
People think the earth is flat or we
don't want Eddie Bravo to get fired up

2329
02:17:32,270 --> 02:17:37,270
about being a flat cause he thinks that
his conspiracy things that he believes

2330
02:17:37,331 --> 02:17:40,630
in. I don't think so. Nobody's in
all kinds of crazy conspiracies.

2331
02:17:40,770 --> 02:17:45,010
Yeah Man, I'm not gonna argue.
I'm not going to argue the

2332
02:17:46,570 --> 02:17:50,650
rubber guard about with him. I don't
want to talk about nothing else man.

2333
02:17:51,700 --> 02:17:55,300
That's too, he's got too many facts
and figures about stuff. You know,

2334
02:17:55,301 --> 02:18:00,010
facts and figures about all
kinds of conspiracy stuff
that I don't want to argue

2335
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:03,880
with. It's all I'm good with
him being in that world.

2336
02:18:04,450 --> 02:18:07,780
I don't want to enter that world. I'm
saying how that world and you know why,

2337
02:18:07,840 --> 02:18:12,580
cause I guess I'm too blind to see. The
reality is, okay, I'm going to stay blind.

2338
02:18:13,360 --> 02:18:17,640
You all good. But the salt
flat, dark earth, there's a is,

2339
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:22,620
it's the official one where if you know,
is it two by three? Two by three. Okay.

2340
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:24,850
So let's come up as far
as the new stuff on Jocko,

2341
02:18:24,851 --> 02:18:29,851
store.com [inaudible] to come
and look at the stuff on there.

2342
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:32,610
If you like it,
go grab one and you can enforce,

2343
02:18:32,830 --> 02:18:37,180
reinforce and support this podcast that
way, which is awesome. I appreciate it.

2344
02:18:37,181 --> 02:18:39,910
You can also get some,
some Jocko white tea,

2345
02:18:39,940 --> 02:18:43,600
which I've been drinking liberally all
night long and I'm feeling pretty good

2346
02:18:43,601 --> 02:18:46,450
right now. How do you have
some cause we're out. Yeah,

2347
02:18:46,460 --> 02:18:48,760
well so I've got massive quantities.

2348
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:52,870
I actually told our supplier I will never,

2349
02:18:52,871 --> 02:18:56,050
we will never run out of this again.
How do we make that happen?

2350
02:18:56,310 --> 02:18:59,890
And then they told me how to make it
happen so it's going to be back in Amazon

2351
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:04,630
directly and we will never run
out of it again. That's my hope.

2352
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:06,760
I ordered a lot of it.

2353
02:19:06,761 --> 02:19:09,340
I learned a lot of it cause I didn't know
that people are going to be so went to

2354
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:13,810
it. And then I realized, cause you
know sometimes you're in a bubble. Yes.

2355
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:17,800
And you think something's really
cool and no one else does.

2356
02:19:17,890 --> 02:19:21,370
I have been in that bubble many times
in my life where I thought something was

2357
02:19:21,371 --> 02:19:24,710
really cool and then I get outside the
bubble and people don't think it's cool

2358
02:19:25,090 --> 02:19:28,520
my whole life.
So I was under suspicion

2359
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,530
that this situation where I like this tea,
this random tea,

2360
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:37,490
and then I got it tweaked to my specific
liking and I thought, well, okay,

2361
02:19:37,491 --> 02:19:41,870
not only have I taken a random thing and
then I've tweaked it to be specifically

2362
02:19:41,871 --> 02:19:46,790
what I like. I'm thinking to myself
like, what seven people in the world,

2363
02:19:46,791 --> 02:19:47,630
we're going to dig this.
Well,

2364
02:19:47,631 --> 02:19:50,870
what I should have done was taken it and
given it to a bunch of people and said,

2365
02:19:50,871 --> 02:19:54,370
hey, is this, what do you think of this?
Because by the time we did that we,

2366
02:19:54,371 --> 02:19:58,910
we basically did that and you realize
that it tastes really, really good.

2367
02:19:58,940 --> 02:20:00,350
It's a unique,

2368
02:20:01,220 --> 02:20:06,220
flavorful taste and I think that's like
part one is that it tastes really good.

2369
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:08,780
It doesn't taste like anything else.
It's just got a very,

2370
02:20:08,900 --> 02:20:11,540
it doesn't taste like a juice.
It doesn't taste like a tea.

2371
02:20:12,050 --> 02:20:13,070
What does it tastes like?

2372
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:16,760
It just tastes like it tastes like
what it tastes like and it tastes good.

2373
02:20:16,761 --> 02:20:21,110
And universally, universally people go, oh
yeah, that's, that's, that tastes great.

2374
02:20:21,590 --> 02:20:25,520
It's just a universally
good tasting thing.

2375
02:20:26,090 --> 02:20:30,410
And then on top of that, you get the
micro dose of caffeine, just a microdose.

2376
02:20:30,411 --> 02:20:34,430
So it's this thing that just comes in
subsurface and just gives it to you,

2377
02:20:34,610 --> 02:20:38,570
but it doesn't override your normal
senses. And then on top of that,

2378
02:20:38,571 --> 02:20:41,420
you've got the antioxidant thing,
which for all I know,

2379
02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:45,800
it's just just repairing and
taking care of your body, right?

2380
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:51,230
So you combine all those things together
and we've got something very popular on

2381
02:20:51,231 --> 02:20:53,150
our hands. And again, I
thought that inside my bubble,

2382
02:20:53,151 --> 02:20:55,190
I thought it was something inside
my bubble was going to be popular.

2383
02:20:55,370 --> 02:20:57,190
But now I realize that it's a very,

2384
02:20:57,410 --> 02:21:00,350
everybody loves the way it tastes and
everybody loves the way it makes you feel.

2385
02:21:00,890 --> 02:21:04,310
So what I gotta do is order, you
know, through the manufacturer,

2386
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:08,030
ordered a ton of it and go online.

2387
02:21:09,330 --> 02:21:12,530
And you know, some people
also said, hey, you know what,

2388
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:15,080
Jocko stuff cost too much.

2389
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:20,830
And it costs a lot because we got a high
quality container to put it in the tin

2390
02:21:22,730 --> 02:21:27,630
as it's known luxury, the
luxury, the luxury is the luxe.

2391
02:21:28,860 --> 02:21:31,880
I didn't say luxurious, I didn't,
I forgot to rewind that part,

2392
02:21:32,030 --> 02:21:37,030
but the tin costs a lot of money
to make and so that's what it is.

2393
02:21:37,550 --> 02:21:40,220
Well when people said it was too
expensive, I said, okay, cool.

2394
02:21:40,550 --> 02:21:43,310
I'll put a in box also.
So we got to come in at a box.

2395
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:47,290
You can still get it in the team because
you need at least one tin, right?

2396
02:21:48,290 --> 02:21:51,680
Tactical multipurpose tactics when you
probably need a few of them in your house.

2397
02:21:51,710 --> 02:21:55,830
Pens, check screws and nails. Check. Um,

2398
02:21:56,320 --> 02:21:58,640
you auntie itself,
check.

2399
02:21:58,940 --> 02:22:03,590
And then you're also going to be able to
buy it in big box with a hundred count

2400
02:22:03,591 --> 02:22:08,150
in there. So we're taking care of you
on that end. Yeah. Again, here I was,

2401
02:22:08,151 --> 02:22:12,440
all I was wrote down to say was
we have Jocko white tea unset.

2402
02:22:12,441 --> 02:22:15,650
I talk about it for eight minutes.
What is wrong with me? You gotta well,

2403
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:18,830
and you know what? I think it's too much
Jocko. White tea has gotten me talking,

2404
02:22:19,550 --> 02:22:22,640
got me mentally engaged at such a
level that I need to just take it easy.

2405
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:27,540
Then it's that feedback loop. Also
we've got a book, extreme ownership.

2406
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:30,840
It's about combat leadership.

2407
02:22:31,050 --> 02:22:36,050
Therefore it's about all
leadership written by myself
and my brother Leif Babin

2408
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:40,740
and if you buy the audio version it
gets read by myself and my brother Leif

2409
02:22:40,741 --> 02:22:44,910
Babin so you can check that out
is also an Amazon. Appreciate it.

2410
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,900
Following that,

2411
02:22:50,400 --> 02:22:53,970
if you happen to want to continue this
little conversation that we're having

2412
02:22:53,971 --> 02:22:58,470
right now or you just want to get
after it on the interwebs, that's cool.

2413
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:03,180
You can do it. We are
there. We're on Twitter,

2414
02:23:03,990 --> 02:23:08,610
we're on Instagram and you know
that we've had that face bookie

2415
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:14,250
echo.
Echo is at Echo,

2416
02:23:14,251 --> 02:23:18,180
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink

2417
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:22,500
and thanks to everybody for listening,

2418
02:23:23,490 --> 02:23:28,490
for joining us as we join you trying to
figure out how to get better and to my

2419
02:23:34,111 --> 02:23:37,320
brothers in arms,
in the military overseas,

2420
02:23:37,321 --> 02:23:40,170
hunting down evil and destroying it.

2421
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:46,610
You all out there stay aggressive and
stay ahead of the enemy and the police and

2422
02:23:48,431 --> 02:23:51,610
law enforcement.
Thanks for holding the line

2423
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:56,560
and fighting crime and the firefighters.
Of course.

2424
02:23:56,680 --> 02:24:01,680
Thanks for your vigilance and
your courage under actual fire

2425
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:09,390
and the rest of you troopers
out there listening,

2426
02:24:09,900 --> 02:24:14,700
honing your skills,
building buildings,

2427
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:18,450
creating creations,
designing designs,

2428
02:24:18,451 --> 02:24:20,610
developing developments,

2429
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:25,170
working on what you are working on.

2430
02:24:27,080 --> 02:24:32,080
Thanks for your relentless pursuit of
excellence and of growth and of progress.

2431
02:24:37,620 --> 02:24:40,680
And most of all,
thank you

2432
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:47,220
for getting after it.
So until next time,

2433
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:52,180
this is echo and Jocko out.

2434
02:24:56,470 --> 02:24:56,540
Okay.
