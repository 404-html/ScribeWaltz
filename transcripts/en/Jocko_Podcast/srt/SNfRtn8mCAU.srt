This is Jocko podcast number
one 41 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,740
Jocko Willink.
[inaudible] good evening.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,513
Yeah.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,130
March 15th,
1631

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,740
yeah,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,260
most loving and kind father and mother,

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,130
my humble duty remembered unto you,
trusting in God.

8
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:25,530
You are in good health and I pray,

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,240
remember my love on to my brother Joseph
and thank him for his kindness that I

10
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,160
found at his hand in London.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,430
Okay.

12
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,310
I know loving father and I do confess,

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,210
yeah,

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,210
that I was an undue TOEFL child unto you
when I live there with you and buy you

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,530
for which I am much
sorrowful and grieved for it.

16
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,680
Trusting in God that he will guide me,

17
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,980
that I will never offend you so any
more and I trust in God that you will

18
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:57,340
forgive me for it.

19
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,430
My writing unto you is to
let you understand what a
country this new England is

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,450
where we live.

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,090
Here are but a few Indians,
a great part of them died this winter.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,610
It was thought it was of the plague.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,190
Here is timber,
good store and Acorns,

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,550
good store and here is good store of fish.

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,780
If we had boats to go for
it in lines to surf fishing.

26
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,860
People here are subject
to diseases for there,

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,880
for here.

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,880
200 odd have died of scurvy and of the
burning fever and beside as many lie

29
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,614
lame,

30
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:50,370
all Sudbury men are dead but three
and three women and some children.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,110
Yeah.

32
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:58,110
Here is no cloth to be had
to make no apparel and shoes.

33
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,120
Yeah.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,120
So I pray father send me four or five
yards of cloth to make some apparel and

35
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:10,200
loving father though I be far distant
from you yet I pray you remember me as

36
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:15,201
your child and we do not
know how long we may subsist.

37
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,690
I pray.
Do not put away your shop stuff for,

38
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:25,360
I think that in the end if I live,

39
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,150
it must be my living for we do not know
how long this plantation will stand.

40
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,880
God has taken away the
Chiefest Stud in the land,

41
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,240
Mr. Johnson and the lady Arabella,
his wife,

42
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,540
which was the cheapest man of a state
in the land and one that would have done

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,720
most good.

44
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,803
Yeah.

45
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,940
So father I pray consider of my cause
for here will be but a very poor thing.

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,590
No being without loving father your
help with provisions from Old England.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,600
Okay.

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,920
I thought to come home in this ship from
my provisions were almost all spent but

49
00:03:10,921 --> 00:03:14,760
that I humbly thank you for your great
love and kindness and sending some

50
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:19,761
provisions or else I should and
mine have been half famished.

51
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,350
But now I will if it please
God that I have my health,

52
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,470
I will plant what corn I can.

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,480
My Wife Remembers her humble duty unto
you and to my mother and my love to

54
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:36,660
brother Joseph.

55
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,660
Thus I leave you to the
protection of all mighty God,

56
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,340
Watertown,
New England.

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,960
And that is an unsigned letter

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,680
from,
as I said,

59
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:59,150
1631 so these are settlers
coming into New England,

60
00:03:59,520 --> 00:03:59,810
the f,

61
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,810
the letters written back to a father
and England and obviously written from a

62
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:07,580
place called New England,

63
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:12,581
which is where I grew up and where I am
in the woods of right now in Franklin

64
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:19,070
county, Maine. And we have a guest
today that is also a new Englander,

65
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,670
a Jujitsu black belt,
the business owner,

66
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:26,480
and a friend of mine by
the name of Peter Roberts.

67
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,790
He's been on the podcast before.

68
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,290
So if you haven't listened to podcast
93 yet and you need to go get the

69
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:38,291
backstory of how I met Peter and
how this little deal got underway,

70
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,290
go listen to podcasts 93 and
then you can come back here

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,020
and listen to the rest of
this one. So here we go. Pete,

72
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,440
welcome back.
Thanks for having me.

73
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,280
And I'm extremely honored to be back
on and was a little bit nervous to come

74
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:59,590
back on. But uh, after all
your razzing and you know,

75
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,680
motivating and flanking me
and after what you just read,

76
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:07,430
I'm ready to go. Yeah, we got it pretty
easy compared to those guys. Holy Shit.

77
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,600
Yeah. And it's interesting because you
know I live in southern California.

78
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,570
Echo as we know is from Hawaii.
Sure.

79
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,070
And what's the temperature variation
in Hawaii? In what inmate? No, no,

80
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,450
in Hawaii. How much does the temperature?
Very. Oh, one decree. Just kidding.

81
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,550
I Dunno. 10 year round,
something like that.

82
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,040
25 I think in the past three days there
was a 40 degree change here in the

83
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:37,790
weather in Maine.
We went from 90 to 50 yeah,

84
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:41,340
it absolutely gives you a false
sense of hope. One day actually

85
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,960
these people that settled here clearly
were some sturdy stock that came up here.

86
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,310
You think about what they went through
and leaving the comforts of England.

87
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:57,311
And what I was thinking about is it's not
like these were woodsmen from England,

88
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,050
right? No you weren't hunters
from England. I mean I'm
sure some of them were,

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,850
but they were people from England,

90
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:07,851
from London and then they were all of a
sudden surrounded by this and you can't

91
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:11,950
prepare for like if there's nothing you
can do conditioning wise to prepare for

92
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,210
this, you just, you, you get
here and you survive, you know,

93
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,160
and that's what they're doing.
I know you're talking about like,

94
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,370
cause his dad had sent him provisions.

95
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,500
That was his insurance policy. You know,
I mean, hey, here's what we can offer you.

96
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:31,220
And I never thought about on the other
side side of things as a parent like

97
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,090
that, who knows what they would
they had for work or jobs,

98
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,640
who knows if they sent them
everything they had financially,

99
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:40,090
what they could afford to send their
son to keep him alive in New England.

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,460
And you've got a pretty much fixed geared
that when your kid sales across the

101
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:49,130
sea in 1631, you are never going to
see them again. Right, right, right.

102
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,180
You've got to figure you're
never gonna see him again. Yeah.

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,490
That's gotta be the thought. Um, all
right, so welcome back. Like I said,

104
00:06:56,491 --> 00:07:01,080
now last podcasts, obviously
we talked about origin, boom.

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,860
And we talked about where it started,
how it started,

106
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,920
the trials and tribulations to say the
least that you went through getting it to

107
00:07:10,171 --> 00:07:13,200
that point.
But it's been a pretty,

108
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,490
so you weren't on the podcast one year
ago because we were up at this origin

109
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,280
camp one year ago and now
you're back on it again.

110
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,820
But it's been a big gear
than a huge benefit.

111
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,550
Been a big year of growth for the company.
How many people?

112
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:33,270
We've grown by another 30 people.
So total,

113
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:37,000
we're like 40 plus
people. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,050
I think this time last year we
were, yeah, right around 12 to 15.

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,440
And we, you know, you
know what is crazy is,

116
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,080
I don't know if I told you this
this time last year, like I don't,

117
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,730
I don't get real,
I'm stressed out this time.

118
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:57,200
Last year we had the immersion
camp, right. We had a,

119
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,840
the grand opening and the factory,

120
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,260
we had just moved a 60,000 square foot
factory into our factory like w like two

121
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,000
or three weeks prior.

122
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:15,770
And it was still moving into and there
were some other things going on with

123
00:08:15,771 --> 00:08:17,530
business or whatever. And, and I,

124
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:21,350
I don't know if I told you this one
night I left camp during the, during,

125
00:08:21,351 --> 00:08:24,140
can't not tell me that I
left camp and went home.

126
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:28,790
I was by myself and my family was still
here and I was laying in bed and I

127
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:32,840
couldn't, uh, I couldn't get to sleep
and I just felt really weird. Like my,

128
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:36,260
my body felt weird and
all of a sudden my heart,

129
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:41,000
I felt like it was beating through my
chest and I was like, what is going on?

130
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,260
Come to find out I had an anxiety attack.
Never had it in my life.

131
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,430
I haven't had 1 cents and there was
more going on. Does that actually mean?

132
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,820
I don't even know what that,
oh dude, I had never, I mean,

133
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,490
sounds like some of the echo 38 or
38 years, you're cruising super hard.

134
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,640
38 years old.
