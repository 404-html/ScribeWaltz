1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,550
I have a standard mantra.
Okay?

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,990
And that is every day is a great day.
I have my faith,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,800
my family, and live in the
finest country in the world.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,140
I see it every day, every chance
I got. And people ask me, well,

5
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:19,800
why? You know, how can you be so positive?
And you know, why do you say that? I say,

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,540
well,
number one,

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:26,690
as a very young 24 year old company
commander in Vietnam in combat,

8
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,230
there were times I didn't know if I
was going to be alive the next moment,

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,670
much less seed and next sunrise.
When you're in those circumstances,

10
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:40,080
what is important in life becomes
real focused. And that is faith,

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,160
family, and living in the
finest country in the world now.

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:46,590
So then people will come
back at me and say, well,

13
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:50,910
how can you say that when we have so
much division in our country? Okay?

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,300
And I say, listen, I'm a little
bit longer and tooth than you are.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,330
And when I was a kid,
the,

16
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:02,280
I've seen the improvements in our
society when it comes to race relations.

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,940
Now I'm a minority. So I
get it. And I told him the,

18
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,390
the odds of me becoming when I was a kid,

19
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,580
the odds of me becoming a major journal
in the United States army were slim next

20
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,760
to none. Okay. When, you know,

21
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:21,930
when we've had an African American
president who was reelected,

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,520
and then I tell people when
President Kennedy was elected,

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,840
that was a big deal. And, and
a lot of people don't know why.

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,960
And I say because he was Catholic,
but today that that's,

25
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,670
that's not a big deal. Right. And
that, that though in those days,

26
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,840
that was a big deal.
So I tell people every day is a great day.

27
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,430
I have my faith, my family, we live in
the finest country in the world. Well,

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,030
that saying was challenged about five
and a half years ago when I had some

29
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:57,120
health challenges, which I think I,
I didn't mention it earlier today.

30
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,983
Uh,

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,320
I was still working in the financial
services industry and I got up in the

32
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,740
morning or shaving and I
felt this pain in my chest.

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:13,020
And I mean, it wasn't a serious
pounding and I wasn't sweating,

34
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:17,520
nausea. So I didn't have a temperature.
So, uh, I thought it was something I ate,

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,110
you know, give it five minutes, it'll
go away. Right. It didn't go away.

36
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,370
So I told my wife, this is not good.
So I finished shaving and dressing. No,

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,340
and she drove me to the emergency room
at the hospital. So I walk in and I say,

38
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:35,550
Hey, you know, I've got this pain in
my chest. I don't know what it is.

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,290
So they do an EKG and they said,
you have had a heart attack.

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,510
Well, suddenly all these doctors and
nurses swoop into the Er, they undress me.

41
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,130
They put me in a hospital gown.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm on a Gurney and I'm on my
way to the operating room, right?

43
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,550
So I'm in the corridor and on this
Gurney, and I say to myself, self,

44
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,540
can you say today is a great day?
And I said, I absolutely can.

45
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,700
I survive Vietnam.

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,510
I have a wonderful wife and children
and I most importantly have my faith.

47
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,240
So in 24 hours,

48
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:21,460
I had three operations. The first
operation was for the heart attack. Okay.

49
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:24,340
So they do an angiogram.
They found out my lad,

50
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,540
which is the widow maker artery,
he was 90% blocked.

51
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,310
So they do an angioplasty, put a stent
in. So by 10 o'clock in the morning,

52
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm a newbie cover he
room. So I'm figuring, well
that's, that's the end of it,

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,280
right?
That wasn't the end of it.

54
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,570
The second thing that happened was my
heart cavity started to fill up with

55
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:48,490
liquid, it's called a fusion.
So I had to go back in for an,

56
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,480
they had to put a hole in my chest so
they could put a tube there so they could

57
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:57,481
drain this liquid and it
filled up a bottle that took
about 24 hours to do that.

58
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,860
Okay. The third thing that happened
then was my kidneys failed,

59
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,960
so I had to go back in and they had to
put another hole in my chest so they

60
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,020
could hook up a day dialysis machine.
Okay.

61
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:13,750
So the standard procedure,

62
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,820
every time I was rolled into the
operating room is, what's your name?

63
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,970
What's your birthday?
How do you feel? Okay.

64
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,190
So I'm on the operating table and I say,

65
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,460
Jim [inaudible] August 3rd
44 every day is a great day.

66
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,580
I have my faith, my family, and live
in the finest country in the world.

67
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,600
I can't tell you the effect that
had on the doctors and nurses.

68
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,730
The first operation, the doctor said,
what is your faith? And I said, well,

69
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:46,870
since you asked me doc, I said, I'm
a Christian. Christ is my savior,

70
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,700
your skill physicians, skilled
nurses, but I'm in God's hands.

71
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,140
So whatever he decides, I'm okay
with. So let's get on with it.

72
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,940
So the second operation there
was a nurse and she said,

73
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,970
where do you go to
church? And I said, well,

74
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,020
I attend Willow Creek Community Church.
And she said,

75
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,790
I do too. So no coincidence.
The third operation,

76
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,230
this was the coolest thing.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
There was a male nurse who is wearing
a camouflage gowned and I said,

78
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,350
you must've been in the
army, nick. I said, yeah.
