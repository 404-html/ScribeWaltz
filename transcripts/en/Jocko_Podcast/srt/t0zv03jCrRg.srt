1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,950
That you got an opportunity here,
your,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,420
your mentor disappears for long stretches.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,820
Good. Let him go take a
long lunch boss. I got it.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,800
Oh you want to assign me these
menial tasks will eventually he,

5
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:15,240
if he's going to take all of these breaks,

6
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,110
then he's going to have you
do the more meaningful work.

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,180
So that's fine. Um, you, you
can do better work than him.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,520
Good.
That's going to be fine.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,570
That's going to show through eventually
he's well connected up the chain of

10
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:33,330
command. Beautiful. Beautiful.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,170
Cause if you can now build
a relationship with him,

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,700
you're going to be well connected to
and that's going to be the hardest part,

13
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,780
right?
The heart that's gonna be,

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,110
it's gonna be hard to do
and it's especially hard
to do because your attitude

15
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:49,590
right now is negative, right? Your
attitude right now is negative.

16
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,940
It's a little ego kicking in.
I can do better than him. He's,

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,370
I'm under utilized.
He's has,

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,460
he does things or he's making me
do things beneath my capabilities.

19
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:02,970
So those were all just ego. It's
fine. You go, there's a good, he goes,

20
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:05,910
got a lot of positives to it may be
what's driving you to want to do better.

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,320
So it's okay,

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,880
but you're going to have to
overcome that in this scenario,

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,440
in order to build a
relationship with this guy, man,

24
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:20,940
I built relationships with guys
that I hated.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,330
You know, I mean, cause guess what? Does
that make me too faced? No, you know what?

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,980
It's my job. I'm a professional. I
am a professional. I guarantee you,

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,940
you come and work with me.

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,900
You will see I am a professional and
yet I will build relationships. So,

29
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,970
so not,
and yet,

30
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:43,971
but so that means my job
and my professionalism is
more important than my ego

31
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,910
and my, and my, uh,

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,530
my create a calorie of other people,
right? I'm not looking down on him going,

33
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:58,620
I'm so, cause what I wanna do
is build a good relationship.

34
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,680
So when we build that good
relationship with him, now he's,

35
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,200
if he's well connected with the
folks up top, they're like, oh,

36
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:08,040
what's up with Billy? All Billy's good
to go, man, he's doing a great job. Now,

37
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,010
what if you're like, well,
the thing that the other,

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,190
so once you got to be careful of what
you don't want to do is create an

39
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:15,810
antagonistic relationship with them.

40
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,870
And that includes threatening
him with your work ethic,

41
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,570
threatening him with
your performance level,

42
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,690
threatening him with your skills so
you almost have to throttle back just a

43
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:34,770
little bit enough that
he's not threatened.

44
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,060
Now the other thing you can do instead
of throttling back is what you do is you

45
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,750
give them the credit, the credit, and
you give him the credit and you're good,

46
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,020
and now he's like a pumped.
He's not looking at you become you.

47
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:47,820
Build the relationship.
That's what we want to do.

48
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:51,540
We want to build a relationship and
we want to put your ego in check.

49
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,280
Do the little menial tasks.

50
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,730
Learn as much as you can and let me tell
you all this is you will rise to the

51
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:05,290
top. If you do it right, you will
rise to the top. If you screw it up,

52
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,310
you will never rise.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,130
If you create an antibiotic
antagonistic relationship with him,

54
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,460
you will not promote. You
will not. If you do it right,

55
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,510
you will end up above him in the
chain of command. It will take time.

56
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,510
It will take swallowing of pride,

57
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,050
but it will happen. It might take
five years. It might take seven years.

58
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,210
It might take nine months.
I don't know.

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
But that's what you have to do to
make it happen and have fun doing it.

60
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,240
If you're going to go crazy every day,
if it hurts you so bad,

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,550
I make a game out of it.
I mean,

62
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm going to make a total game out
of it where my goal is to build this

63
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:45,940
relationship with this guy.
I'm going to make a game out of it.

64
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,870
We're going to have fun with it.

65
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,570
I'm not going to be angry when I
come home from work and go, God,

66
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,720
I can't believe I had to shake his
hand. No, I'm going to come back like,

67
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:55,570
you know what? Hey plug. Talked
to my wife was a, Hey, guess what?

68
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,950
He actually bought me lunch today and we
were laughing about the football game.

69
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,970
I don't even like football. You know what
I mean? I'm gonna, I'm gonna build that.

70
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,030
And I'm going to win.

71
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,700
And in the long run you're guaranteed
to win if you can play that game. So

72
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,900
again, everyone thinks it's going
to be like are you, does not me.

73
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,030
Cause I was in the military,
you just not meet the standards.

74
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,490
What you do is you smash him and
report them up the chain of command.

75
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,870
Oh that good luck with that.

76
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,960
You have this guy as well connected and
has relationships with Amy where they're

77
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:25,230
going to go and look.
Shut up. New Guy. Yeah.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,100
Cause you're actually proving not only,
you're actually proving when you do this,

79
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:34,210
you're actually proving that you're not
a good leader and that you can't put

80
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:36,550
your ego in check.
You're proving that you can't,

81
00:04:36,551 --> 00:04:41,120
you're proving that you can't work with
some people. We have that Guy Yo Jocko,

82
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:45,430
he, oh add Taco can't work with
anybody. Junk was really good.

83
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:48,990
As long as he's working with, you
know his team. So what does that mean?

84
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,520
It means you're confined for the rest
of your life of only working with your

85
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:55,030
team. Yup. Whereas if it's, hey, Jocko was
good to go, he can work with anybody. Oh,

86
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,370
he worked with bill who is an
EGOMANIAC and he worked with Mike,

87
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:00,370
who is a lazy bastard. Guess what? It
doesn't matter where you put Jocko.

88
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,570
He's going to get it done. Okay, cool.

89
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,580
That's the attitude we want
people to have about us.
