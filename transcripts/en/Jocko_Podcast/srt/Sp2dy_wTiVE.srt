1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
This is Jocko podcast number
55 with echo journals and me,

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,290
Jocko Willink. Good
evening. Echo could evening.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,240
Well,
our last podcast,

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,990
which I guess is no surprise at this
point when a little loan did he not have

5
00:00:21,841 --> 00:00:24,510
room for Q and.
A.

6
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,630
So because of that we have,

7
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,410
we will dedicate podcast number 55 today
to Q and a questions from the inner

8
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:35,910
webs.

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,910
Thanks to everyone that has submitted
questions through the interwebs so that we

10
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,970
can attempt to answer some of them.
Yeah.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,190
And with that Echo Charles. Yes.
Questions from the interwebs.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,780
What do you got? Well, first
question is how important

13
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,690
is purpose,

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,670
reason or cause and being successful
like the Perp, your purpose, right?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,833
Well,

16
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,060
clearly purpose and reason and
cause are extremely important.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,680
This is,
this is the why of of your actions.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,480
This is knowing why you're
doing what you're doing.

19
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:22,260
This is the commander's intent.
And so you,

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,570
you absolutely, absolutely.
These are important.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,720
If you don't know why you're
doing something well then
let me ask you a question.

22
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,440
Why are you doing something he does?
It's very clear.

23
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:35,760
It's very simple to understand.
So yeah, you got to know,

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,470
if you don't know why you're
doing something and didn't,

25
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,990
what were you going to do when you
hit an obstacle, you're going to stop.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,670
What do you,

27
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,100
what adaptations are you going to make
when things go wrong to overcome them?

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,640
You're not going to make any cause you
don't know why you're doing it. Yeah.

29
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,380
So if you have no reason,
if you have no reason for doing something,

30
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:54,120
you're not going to do it.
So you got to have a longterm goal.

31
00:01:54,121 --> 00:01:57,900
You've got to understand the underlying
purpose of what you're doing.

32
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:02,901
Now this doesn't necessarily meaning
that it mean that it has to be rigid

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,200
because it doesn't have to be rigid.
You know,

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:11,910
I'll tell you an interesting case as an
example I'll give you is my own case,

35
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,170
right? So of course, you know,
I'm all about planning in,

36
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:20,880
in always having a longterm plan and all
that stuff. But to be honest with you,

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,340
the situation that I'm
in right now as a human,

38
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,070
I didn't have a long term plan for
this. You know the, the, the, I,

39
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,330
you know,
Lafe and I wrote the book,

40
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:33,630
I had no intention of writing a book
that kind of happened, you know,

41
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:36,960
cause people were asking us and
as we worked with businesses,

42
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:39,090
they said you have this stuff written
down. So we ended up writing the book.

43
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,621
Once we wrote it,

44
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,500
we thought maybe we'd be handing it
out when we go and work with companies.

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,040
Literary agent saw today, let me,
let me show this to some publishers.

46
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,010
Publishers on said, let,
let us publish this. Okay,

47
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:53,490
so you figure you're going to publish it.
Well, even when you're published a book,

48
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,770
you don't expect it.
A bunch of people are going to read it.

49
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,110
You expect that you could have a
book published and that's cool.

50
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,100
But it ended up doing really well.

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,460
So that kind of happened with that.

52
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,590
All of a sudden I was on a couple
podcasts. Well, I didn't, you know,

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,400
I didn't have any intention when I
went on Tim Ferriss, his podcast,

54
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:12,250
I didn't say to myself, this is going
to propel me into my own podcast,

55
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,270
or Joe Rogan's part didn't say,

56
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,820
now if you know Joe Rogan's going to
launch me into the podcast world. No. Hmm.

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,580
I didn't expect that, but it happened
and you know what? It happened.

58
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:24,040
It made sense to me. Okay,
these two guys are squared away.

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,200
They're square to wait in this particular
genre and they're recommending my mind

60
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:31,750
is open. Okay, let's
try and make a podcast.

61
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,490
Did I know that the podcast was
going to be super popular now?

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,840
I just thought we were making
a podcast so that you know,

63
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,880
the few people want would want
to listen to it. Cool for,

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,730
I mean then look what happens. Next
thing you know we're, we're making tea.

65
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,070
You don't know the next thing
I'm making tea. I had no,

66
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,670
no idea that that ti
would be part of my world.

67
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,320
So all this stuff happened, right? But,

68
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,550
but the goal,
really the underlying,

69
00:04:01,551 --> 00:04:04,660
the reason for me doing all this is
still the same through the whole thing.

70
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,970
And that is that I want to help people.

71
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,420
I want to help people with something that,
the lessons that I've learned,

72
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:14,230
I want to help them. So how can I do
that? Well, you write them down. Okay.

73
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,110
You wrote it down so people can read it.
Great. How else can you help them? Oh,

74
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,860
you can make a podcast so people can
access it easily and cheaply. Cool.

75
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,780
Here you go. So the underlying go, oh, you
know, I want people to be healthy. Well,

76
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:29,680
what's a good way to be healthy?
Stop drinking monster energy drinks.

77
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,690
Stop Drinking Red Bull 12 a day and it's
our drinking something that's healthier.

78
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,690
Oh, okay, cool. Jocko white
tea. Next thing you know,
that's what we've got going on.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,070
So it's, it's, that's been my,

80
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,530
that's been my goal and I haven't really,
even though I,

81
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,860
even though I strayed from what maybe the
original path I thought I was going to

82
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:51,100
take, I still stayed.
My reason is the same.

83
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,180
And I think that's what I'm saying.

84
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,940
When your reason is clear
and your purpose is clear,

85
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,980
that's going to make your drive clear
and that's gonna make you execute well

86
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,710
because you know where you're going,
you know you where you want to be,

87
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,710
you understand your purpose and why
you're doing something and that's what's

88
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:13,700
gonna help you be successful in my
opinion. Do you think that like, oh, um,

89
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,910
you know, people, they'll be like,

90
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,800
this is my why and it'll be like
their kids or something like that.

91
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,930
Do you think that falls within
this like, you know, like reason,

92
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,490
purpose and all this stuff? Yeah, I
think, I think that that's the same,

93
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,670
this same general, the guy could've
said purpose, reason. Cause why?

94
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,640
I think that the question
could have said that.

95
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,520
I think that if your purpose is your
kids really clear example, right?

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,480
I have a lot of people might say
that. Well, that's cool. But that's,

97
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,030
you're going to have to clarify that a
little bit more because if your purpose

98
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:49,720
is your kids then quit your job and
just spend all day with your kids,

99
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:51,160
well then obviously you're
not supporting your kids.

100
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:55,320
Cause now you can't afford
to buy him food. So your,

101
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,440
your goal should be taking good care of
and providing for your children's now

102
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,140
and in the future. Wow. Okay. Now that
makes sense. Now you're looking longterm,

103
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,500
short term, you gotta you know
that you have to work hard now.

104
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,970
You don't have to make
investments for them. So that,

105
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,050
that's the kind of thing that's beyond
just a simple, I'm doing this for my kids.

106
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,940
Cause what are you doing for your kids?
What are you trying to achieve for him?

107
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,310
Yeah.
So like for using that example,

108
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,850
like this is my why, it's
my daughter, it's less.

109
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,170
This is why I'm, you know, I don't
know, writing a book, it's more,

110
00:06:26,171 --> 00:06:31,090
this is why I can endure the hard days
or this is why I'm going to continue to

111
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,670
work hard kind of thing out.
Whatever it is I'm doing.

112
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Yeah. And I just have an underlying
yes and underlying reason. That's,

113
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:41,550
that's a question that I think that's the
answer. Yes. Yeah, it's pretty, actually,

114
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,760
I should've just answered that
in two words. I should have said.

115
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,970
How important is purpose, reason
cause and being successful? Answer.

116
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,890
Very important.
There you go.

117
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,530
You can have a lot of
different reasons to, you know,

118
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,100
or like a few core reading more than one.

119
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,661
Yeah.

120
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:58,060
You know what I'd say if there's anything
to be taken away from this question,

121
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,990
ed is if you don't feel, here's the,
here's the, I would say the takeaway.

122
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,740
If you don't feel some
kind of drive in your life,

123
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,320
if you don't feel
passionate about something,

124
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,040
if you feel like you're wandering in,
meandering through the world,

125
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,720
then it's time to assess. Then it's
time to say, okay, what is my reason?

126
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,110
What am I trying to do?
What would I like to do in the world?

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,000
Now we get something valuable here.

128
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,540
We all know that you got to have a
purpose so y'all didn't get out of reason.

129
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,930
So if you feel yourself meandering down
the path with no reason, no purpose,

130
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,790
dig in and find one.

131
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,280
Next question.
I want to begin training in Jujitsu,

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,460
but financial constraints dictate that
I can keep my gym membership to keep

133
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:49,910
getting after it at 4:00 AM
or begin training Jujitsu,

134
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,170
but not both.

135
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,110
Oh, it's a black and white question. Is
it one or the other? Okay. First of all,

136
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,470
check around your area and see if
there's a gym that has both. Right.

137
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,000
I know that's one of the reasons
that we created my gym. Victory. MMA.

138
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,740
There's an an fitness on there too. Yup.
Cause no matter what you want to do,

139
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,440
if you're in the game, you can
do it there. You can do striking,

140
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:14,630
you can do Jujitsu or you can
do wrestling, you can do boxing,

141
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,760
you can do weightlifting, all kinds of
crossfit. You can do Olympic lifting,

142
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,970
you can do power lifting, you
can do calisthenics. You could,

143
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,800
so you knew everything there. That's
why we created the gym. And you,

144
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,890
it's not more expensive than a straight
Jujitsu gym where it's not more

145
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,270
expensive than a straight crossfit gym.

146
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,070
It's actually cheaper than most
of both foes. So look around,

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
see if you have a gym
that has both any fee.

148
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,650
If there is no gym around there that
has both, maybe you do what I did.

149
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,730
And you start a gym that has both, right?
I mean you could do that. I did it,

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,400
did it with some of my buddies said,
hey, you know what? We want to,

151
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,010
we want to train all the time
and all these different aspects.

152
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,460
How can we do that? Can
we go to one at, you know,

153
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,840
four o'clock in the afternoon.

154
00:08:57,841 --> 00:09:00,060
We have to go to another gym at five
o'clock then we have to go to another gym

155
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:03,870
at seven o'clock do we want to do that?
No. So what do we do? Make our own gym.

156
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,850
Make it what we want.
And guess what?

157
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,180
When you do something like that in the
business world, if you, if you, I think,

158
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,950
I think Tim Ferriss said,
scratch your own itch, right?

159
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,450
You have an itch that you want to scratch.

160
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,550
There's other people that are going
to have the same match and that's what

161
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,710
happened with our gym. So everyone
goes, yeah, I want to train.

162
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,610
Of course I want to drain.
So maybe you start your own gym and Oh,

163
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:27,000
you're not a skilled boot, a Brazilian
jujitsu practitioner. Guess what?

164
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,150
For the first time ever in America,

165
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,740
there's actually a bunch of really
good Jujitsu practitioners in,

166
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,290
maybe you couldn't get a black
belt to come to where you live.

167
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,680
Maybe you could cause there's a good
chance you're good, but a brown belt,

168
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,590
purple belt, they can be a
good or great instructor. Yeah.

169
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,410
So you might open up a gym and start that.

170
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:52,650
Now that doesn't mean also that you have
to make a huge investment to do that.

171
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,460
You could start off with
your garage and some mats.

172
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,520
So that's an idea. Another thing you could
do for you. Okay, so that doesn't exist.

173
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,530
How would you find Jujitsu is,
this is a tough one, right?

174
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,060
We want to stay healthy,
we want to stay fit,

175
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,620
but you Jitsu is kind of the priority.
It's kind of the priority.

176
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:17,460
Don't tell you why it's
learning, right? If you take,

177
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,700
if you take me and you and we go through
this situation and you decide that

178
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:26,490
you're going to do Jujitsu and I decided
I'm going to weight lift in 10 years,

179
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,880
who's happy and who's sat?
We know the answer.

180
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,630
The answer's clearly now I start
because I now I have enough money.

181
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:37,220
So six years into it I started training
Jujitsu and you're a brown belt or a

182
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,220
black belt and I don't have this knowledge
and it's going to take me six years

183
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:43,770
to get there. Meanwhile you,
while you were training,

184
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:48,150
guess what else you were doing? You were
doing calisthenics, you were sprinting,

185
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,830
you are,
you are lifting rocks,

186
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,820
you are doing cheap stuff for free and
you're still getting a massive benefit.

187
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,220
So for me,

188
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,490
my priority is going to go to the Jujitsu
because you can go and spend $40 on a

189
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:06,540
set of rings for your garage or
your basement or your hallway.

190
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,870
And next thing you know you can
do pull ups, you can do dips,

191
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,930
you can do muscle ups, you can do
squats and sprints all day long.

192
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:13,830
You don't need anything for that.

193
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,610
So you can get a massive benefit with a
set of rings or you can just get a pull

194
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:22,611
up bar and you can just do pull ups and
you go to Home Depot and buy a pipe and

195
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:27,330
a couple nails and nail it into the
wall and you've got to pull a bar.

196
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,460
Now you can do pull ups,
push ups and squats and you're good to go.

197
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:31,770
You could become a beast
with those exercises,

198
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,760
so I would prioritize and at do that,

199
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,190
I would prioritize the Jujitsu and I'd
make some kind of a home gym or I'd go to

200
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:43,620
all why MCA or some cheaper kind of gym.

201
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:48,770
The other thing you go to do your
Jujitsu school and become the mop person.

202
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,030
Start cleaning up our mob and maths.

203
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,480
That's another thing you
can do to make this happen.

204
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,820
Maybe you can get a little
deal cut at both places.

205
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,660
Most gym places that you know, if you go
in there and say, hey look, I, I need,

206
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,790
I can't afford this right now.
What can you do for me?

207
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,700
Maybe they'll cut you some kind of a deal.
Yeah.

208
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,780
The other thing that you can likely do.

209
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,800
Now you're saying you don't have
the budget for this situation.

210
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,620
What is it in your budget right
now that you can cut out? Yeah,

211
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,250
that's my question. And the funny
thing is what can you cut out coffee?

212
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,120
A lot of people drink two
or $3 worth of coffee a day.

213
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,430
Probably even more than that. I
don't know. You're a coffee drinker.

214
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,650
You are going to trigger how,
how much,

215
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,730
how much does a coffee addict to
drink a day from Starbucks? Yeah.

216
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:36,400
That's the spectrum.
And the, you know, the,

217
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,690
but we're talking Starbucks cups a day.
Yeah.

218
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,640
If you're going to Starbucks and
buying. Yeah. I think, I don't know.

219
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,380
I don't buy it. Well, I get coffee
from on it to be honest with you.

220
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,170
So you can make your own
at home and stuff. But um,

221
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,020
but if someone would
works near a Starbucks,

222
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:57,340
they stop on the way to a gym membership.
It's for four bucks a day.

223
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,800
So that's 120 bucks a
month. Yeah. So boom,

224
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,990
you cut out coffee or you make your own,

225
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,400
make your own coffee
and you're good to go.

226
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:05,590
What about the nights that you go out
to eat? You're like, oh, you know,

227
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:07,030
I don't feel like cooking down.
It'll go out and do it.

228
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:11,940
A little restaurant that costs you 30
40 bucks a shot. Get rid of that Kate.

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,770
Well, bunch of cable
bill, your cable bill,

230
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,230
you're watching TV, nothing. Zero
productive. Coming out of that zero,

231
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,260
you're not doing anything beneficial
for yourself. Get rid of your cable.

232
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,281
Next thing you know,

233
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:27,730
you get rid of your cable and now
you've got enough money for your gym

234
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:31,990
membership. You know, sell another
one cell phone usage, right?

235
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:35,650
We rack up the big numbers on cell
phone. What are you doing? What?

236
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:40,180
What are you doing? Is it to
surf the interwebs and get,
you know, lose your mind.

237
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,930
So what can you cut down on that?

238
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:44,620
Because I'm thinking now you could
scrape away a little bit here and there.

239
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,480
Just lower your plan and use your,

240
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,280
use your phone less watching the UFC
get into u of C's. I love the UFC,

241
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,780
but instead of watching it at
home for 50 bucks or 59 bucks,

242
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,650
go to a bar and pay 10 bucks to get
in and watch it there for 10 bucks.

243
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,990
You just save 40 bucks or however many
about bucks that was cause actually I

244
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:06,460
want to try second. See, you know
there's all kinds of movie night.

245
00:14:06,461 --> 00:14:10,540
What about the note? You want to go
see the new movie in the theater? No,

246
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,590
don't go see the new movie. The theater
that costs. That's an expensive now,

247
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,470
isn't it? Yes. Is it more than $10?

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,890
I don't even remember. Less than,
I think it's like 10 or 1511 yeah.

249
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,480
Well I went one time is the 11 that
was is over a year ago though. Yeah.

250
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:28,160
So cut that out. Bike to work, you know,

251
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:32,380
do something to get you started shaving
a little bit of money because in the

252
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:34,930
long run, what you're going
to get from these two things,

253
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,820
from fitness and from Jujitsu are going
to be going to have so much value in

254
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:43,210
your life. There's going to be,
they're going to be worth way more.

255
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,770
What these little marginal
things that you're cutting
out are. Yeah. And that way,

256
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:52,130
like in the beginning how you said
like what is it that you can cut

257
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,330
out?
So basically you're,

258
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:58,331
you're identifying what is it right now
that you're considering more important

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,890
than you did two where
the gym or whatever,

260
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,320
which the term actual answer
to that is nothing there.

261
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:10,310
There's nothing more important than your
life then your fitness and really your

262
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,400
Jujitsu is part of your fitness and
also its knowledge and its confidence in

263
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:16,070
it's, yeah. Okay. Um, I know that
people are gonna Freak out. Okay.

264
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,160
I'm not saying it's the most important
thing in your life in terms of,

265
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:23,600
in terms of, of purchases
that you can make. Yes.

266
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,460
These two things are of the highest level.

267
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:27,940
Now you need a car to get back
and forth to work. Understood.

268
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,910
You need a house for sleeping. Understood.
You need food on the table. Understood.

269
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,770
You need to take care of your family.
Understood.

270
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,900
As soon as you get into the
optional things in life.

271
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,080
These are the top two. These
are the top two. I think so too.

272
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,420
And tell me I'm wrong, I don't, I'm
not, I can't tell you you can get good.

273
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:50,230
But when Phil, but making the, as
far as making the decision goes your,

274
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,810
you're essentially identifying what you
currently are holding more important

275
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,590
than it. Regardless of what you
think is more important. Your,

276
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,370
you got to identify it and the
actions are a statement. Yeah. Yes.

277
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,050
Of what you believe get and that
I'm a big one too is like drinking.

278
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,570
I got to know not everyone drinks.
So who knows? I don't know.

279
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,730
Some person might not drink at all,

280
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:15,180
but if you buy a six pack of beer,
let's say you do that, you know,

281
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,010
I don't know,
twice a week or something like that.

282
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,440
That's like more than a gym members to
that's your coffee thing is big too.

283
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,280
But yeah, there, yeah, there is a lot
of little, little ways. The cable thing,

284
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,790
I gotta be honest only because you're
probably not the only one that watches TV.

285
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,210
I know it, the argument is like, Hey,

286
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:38,450
TV isn't good quote unquote for anybody,

287
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,260
so everyone should just be signed
on in the household kind of thing.

288
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,530
So what's your point? It's not that
easy all the time saying you know,

289
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,170
like there is going to be
some ripples in the, you know,

290
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:49,940
especially when you first
make that transition.

291
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,080
If you choose to take it upon yourself
to cut out cable because you want to go

292
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,360
to Jujitsu. No. Oh. And you
make everyone in your house.

293
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,610
You improve everyone in your
house mentally and physically.

294
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,070
I know what it's like surgery.

295
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:04,460
He got to make that initial incision
and open up everything and make a mess

296
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,110
before you can repair, you know, so that,

297
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,610
that initial part is going to be
most of the ways around that too.

298
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,230
You get Netflix or Hulu or
one of those things that were,

299
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:17,670
you get streaming on demand, right? The,

300
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,290
which is kind of where everything's going
anyway, really right now. Yeah. But yeah,

301
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:26,240
there's some, there's some good stuff
too. Good. So as far as the job,

302
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,100
find a way to do both. It can be done.
Know you can do it. Get creative.

303
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,530
The home gym is good.

304
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,050
That's good because that's something
you could just start slowly and start

305
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:40,960
adding to slowly four bucks. You've got
rings. Don't have your start. Yeah, me,

306
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,570
you'll be good to go for
sure. Um, okay. Next question.

307
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,040
Jocko had an incident. I
wanted your opinion on love,
your book booking podcast,

308
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,770
always listening to apply your
lessons to my life, job and family.

309
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,560
I was driving home one night with my wife
and four year old son in the car when

310
00:17:58,561 --> 00:18:01,650
some junk idiot was walking
in the middle of the roadway.

311
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,530
He stood in front of my car
refusing to move, running his mouth.

312
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,200
My wife begged me not to get out of
the car. Guy Reached in his front,

313
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,350
reached into his front waistband like he
had a gun and and although myself being

314
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:17,520
a police officer and having countless
incidents and experience like this,

315
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:22,490
I didn't feel he did more like drunk
and bravado or grandstanding any case.

316
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Those I was armed and having trained in
boxing and a little bit of Jujitsu felt

317
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,130
I could have handled this situation.

318
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,180
This lasted about a minute of him
standing there and eventually I just drove

319
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:37,950
around him while he was running his mouth,
calling me names and all that stuff.

320
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:42,120
My first priority obviously is getting
my family home safely and making sure

321
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,250
nobody will ever do any harm to them.

322
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,460
But another part of me felt like,
what am I teaching my son? I mean,

323
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:53,000
is that okay? Um, you know,

324
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,660
is that okay to let people disrespect you
and act any way they want towards you?

325
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,370
So I dropped off my s uh,

326
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,850
so I dropped off my family and went
back looking for the guy. He was gone.

327
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,970
I guess lucky for me as well as him.

328
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,280
I'm questioning my decision,
not out of ego,

329
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,050
but only because of the
example I want to be to my son.

330
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,680
That you never go looking for
trouble and confrontation,

331
00:19:19,681 --> 00:19:21,570
but you don't back down from it

332
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,400
ever. Okay. Well just first of all,

333
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,260
you one, just so you know, you won,

334
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,490
you got a wife and a kid. Yeah, you won,

335
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,650
right? So options or three
options here. Well, for one,

336
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,490
if you're a police officer, you could
call the police. You could, you know,

337
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,370
gone get on your radio and call them to
say what's going on and have this guy

338
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:53,310
arrested before he causes on the of an
actual accident. Being out in the strode,

339
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,130
like an idiot being out in the road
like an idiot. So that's an option.

340
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:02,420
But, but the other thing is like what
are you trying to teach your son?

341
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Are you trying to teach your son that
he should fight every idiot that offends

342
00:20:10,191 --> 00:20:13,790
him? He's, if you, if
that's what you teach him,

343
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,140
he is not going to have a very
productive life or a very nice life.

344
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,810
So there's too many negatives,
right? That can happen there.

345
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,470
This actually happened
to something similar to,

346
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:26,160
this happened to me a little while ago.

347
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:31,161
I was down by the ocean down by the pier
in the neighborhood where I live and

348
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:35,720
there was a like a tweaker crazy, you
know, drunk on drugs and all that.

349
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,810
And it was, it wasn't as
direct as this. He wasn't,

350
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:44,080
he wasn't saying anything at me,
but he's yelling swear words and,

351
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,440
and he's in front of my kid,
my kid,

352
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,470
this was when my son was probably six or
seven years old and he's just alone and

353
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:54,940
he's isolated, but he's swearing
and just acting crazy. Right?

354
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,630
And what I did was I said to my son,
okay, you see this guy right here?

355
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,900
Have you heard of what drugs are? This
is what drugs do to you right here. This,

356
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:06,670
this guy, this is where it ends up. So
this guy's a miscreant, he's a criminal.

357
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,820
And the other thing I told him, I
said, what if this guy attacks us?

358
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:13,120
What do you think would happen?
And my son was kind of, you know,

359
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,730
will you would choke him cause my
son trained to do two at that time.

360
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:17,500
And he goes, well you would choke
him. And I was like, that's right.

361
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,950
I'm not afraid of this guy.
We're not afraid of this guy.

362
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,600
This is no factor because we know how to
fight, we know how to defend ourselves.

363
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,030
But that being said,

364
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,560
what we want to do is we want to
avoid the situation. You know,

365
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:37,540
there's all kinds of, all
kinds of bad things that can
happen there. We know this,

366
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,230
I told my son, like this guy could
have a knife, Scott could have a gun.

367
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:45,010
This guy could have, this guy could
just have a blood borne disease, right?

368
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,480
This guy could have a bloodborne disease.

369
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:49,570
Now I go and get in a fight with him
and now I have a bloodborne disease.

370
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,790
You know what? What, what, what? That's
horrible. That's a horrible situation.

371
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,000
So like I said, I told him that
this is, this is why we train.

372
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:59,620
This is why we know how to use firearms.

373
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,610
Because when people are maniacs and if
they're insane and psychopathic and they

374
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:08,620
have weapons,
you need to have a weapon yourself.

375
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,850
You need to be able to defend yourself.
So our PR, this is what I teach my son.

376
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,660
My primary objective is
to be safe, right? To,

377
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,130
to not get to avoid these situations.
And guess what?

378
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,240
If you still feel the need to like be
a man in the situation or prove that

379
00:22:29,291 --> 00:22:31,300
you're a man or proof to your son,
that which is valuable.

380
00:22:31,301 --> 00:22:35,010
I'm not trying to put that down.
You want your son to see that, that,

381
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,900
that you should be strong and that you
should be able to stand up for yourself

382
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:40,420
and that you will don't ever
have to back down to anybody.

383
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,560
But that's why your son comes with you
to the gym. That's why he trains Jujitsu.

384
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,430
That's why you train Jiu Jitsu. That's why
he watches you day in, day out, day out,

385
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,450
working out, being strong,
being tough, going to the gym,

386
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,910
training with firearms. That's why he
sees all that stuff. So he knows. I mean,

387
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:59,230
I'll tell you right now,
my kids,

388
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:04,300
if you were to ask my kids like
against a random person in the street,

389
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,540
they would, they pro basically think
I could beat up anyone in the world.

390
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,150
You know what I mean? That's
the thing. Because as I said,

391
00:23:09,151 --> 00:23:13,270
me training all the time, right?
That's all they see me do. So,

392
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,340
so that's that.
Now the disrespect part,

393
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,420
d disrespected me, right?
Disrespect. And sometimes you know,

394
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,880
disrespect me is one thing, but
now you disrespect my wife, right?

395
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,580
Well again,

396
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:35,070
how can you be disrespected?
And that's what I explained.

397
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,630
I would explain to my son,
you cannot just be disrespect,

398
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,960
be disrespected by someone that
has no respect for themselves.

399
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,670
And if you are a drunk idiot in the
street, you have no respect for yourself.

400
00:23:49,671 --> 00:23:51,710
You don't,
you cannot disrespect me.

401
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,460
It is impossible for you to give me
disrespect and even respect yourself as a

402
00:23:55,461 --> 00:24:00,320
human. Right? So, so that's just, that's
just added. It doesn't get any account.

403
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,920
And I'll tell my son that all day long or,
or any of my kids that all day long,

404
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,460
you can't be disrespected by someone
that doesn't even respect themselves.

405
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,290
You know what I am respect.
I'm even respectful to this drunk idiot,

406
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,200
giving them the benefit of the doubt.
I am respect.

407
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:19,880
So you know,

408
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,640
then the other pieces, not
backing down from trouble, right?

409
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,000
And I'm not gonna back down from

410
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,180
trouble, but I am going to avoid it.
We're going, I'm going to avoid it.

411
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,080
And you know what?
Trouble avoids me.

412
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,030
Kate avoids me.

413
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,200
And if you are working now in you're
staying strong and you have the confidence

414
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,670
because you know you can handle yourself,

415
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,630
trouble is going to avoid
you 99% of the time.

416
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,190
And the other thing is
you got to tell your kids,

417
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:57,110
I mean my son is getting older now.

418
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,210
If he gets in a fight with
someone he could kill them.

419
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:00,920
I mean that's a straight
up what could happen.

420
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:05,420
And so now I've got an [inaudible] and
you know he's a young kid so he's got a,

421
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,820
he's got to do the things that you're
talking about in this question.

422
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,400
Prove themself and prove that he's
not going to back down. I was,

423
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,510
I got to explain to them,
listen,

424
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,350
let me tell you what comes with
getting in a street fight. A cool rush.

425
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:18,500
Cause it's fun, right?
It's fun. So you get that.

426
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,510
Maybe you get a little bit of props,
you get a little bit of respect from the,

427
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:27,260
from the, you get accred right?
Some street credit from your people.

428
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,350
Let me tell you what else comes with it.
Along with those two things, which are,

429
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:33,860
which are cool, right? Possible jail time,

430
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,840
possible injuries, possible
lawsuits, the broken hand.

431
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:41,990
I mean even if just, okay, those
are the big ones, right? Jail time.

432
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,670
Which there's been plenty of cases
where there was a claim case here in San

433
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,920
Diego. Guy Punched another guy, fell
on the curb. Dead died. Right? Yeah.

434
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,680
Those things really happen. Not to
mention you could get, you know,

435
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,160
so you get jail time, you get an injury.
Not, not to mention you could get killed,

436
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,590
right? Cause you think you're
a tough guy. Guess what?

437
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,650
The greatest MMA fighters in the world
get caught with a crack in the face and

438
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:06,140
they get knocked out. You fall down
and hit a curb. You, you could die.

439
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:10,760
So there's that aspect too. But
then you get to the injuries, right?

440
00:26:10,761 --> 00:26:12,680
Cause you're getting a street
fight, you're going to get
some kind of an injury,

441
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,490
you're going to get some
kind of an injury. It's just
going to happen. You know,

442
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,590
whether it's just a little cut or a
little brazen and you're going to have

443
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:20,990
something that's a pain. It could be a
major injury. You could break your hand.

444
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:24,860
That happens all the time, lawsuits
because now you're going to get sued.

445
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,750
Now they're coming after you and if you,

446
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,270
it's just a stupid thing like a rip jacket
or a scuff me. It just isn't worth it.

447
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:33,140
It isn't worth it.

448
00:26:33,141 --> 00:26:36,950
Especially because we're talking about
an individual that you can crush in an

449
00:26:36,951 --> 00:26:39,550
instant and that has no value
as a human in this account.

450
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,160
What this person's doing,
none. This person is an idiot.

451
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,490
Don't go down to their level
and play that game. Instead,

452
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:52,910
avoid that and go to the gym
and train more and be ready.

453
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,140
Yeah. That's my opinion. Good job on
walking away, going out to find the guide.

454
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,520
Luckily you already said,

455
00:26:59,521 --> 00:27:02,100
luckily you didn't find him
because right now who knows?

456
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,670
Maybe you'd be the guy that's on you.
You're going to jail. The cop that, oh,

457
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,550
you're a cop and you were armed and you
went and got in a fight with this guy

458
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,920
and you've pulled your weapon because
you were losing it. And he shot him.

459
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,440
And then what do we see when she's
somebody that had cell phone and they

460
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:16,180
recorded the whole thing and they see
you pushing this guy around. Yeah.

461
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,210
It's not a good situation.

462
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,100
And you gotta be ultra responsible when
you're carrying ultra responsible when

463
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:27,360
you're carrying, you know that we all
know that when we carry, we got to avoid.

464
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:31,960
That's, that's what we have to
do when we're packing. Wow. Okay.

465
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,040
Yeah. And you can kind of tell
when someone's scared. You know,

466
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:41,610
when like if this guy and a guy in
the street and you're in the car,

467
00:27:41,611 --> 00:27:44,940
that's another, that seems real obvious.
You drive around and you go home,

468
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,520
but it's, you know, it's
someone's like, get it.

469
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:50,160
Like if you're walking on the sidewalk
and he gets in your way, that's, you know,

470
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:54,400
it's kind of different and whatever,
but avoiding the situation. Yeah.

471
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,660
And you're not scared because
you prepared to whatever and you,

472
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,720
you simply walk around or go the
other way or something like that.

473
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,600
The people with you, they can tell,
they can tell you, not scared.

474
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,270
You can tell that you're making the
right decision, but if you are scared,

475
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,170
whether you fight the guy or you run away
scared, they can tell that too. Yeah.

476
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,820
So I had another situation the other day,
I was walking out street with my whole,

477
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,800
well yeah with, with my whole family
thing going to get some ice cream. It was,

478
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,140
it was a couple months goes in the
summertime going to get some ice cream.

479
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:25,420
Haley had a discipline, disciplinary
breakdown in my own mentality,

480
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,280
which you're going to get ice cream.

481
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,180
So we're walking down the street and
out of nowhere this guy just gets in my

482
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,510
like stood up and got in my face with
really fast and I just kinda looked at him

483
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,070
and sort of did the,
you know, into the um,

484
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,870
semi, not a full on fight
stance but I turned, you know,

485
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,020
like a quarter turn and just looked
at him because I thought, okay,

486
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,940
we're going to rock and roll,
we'll make this happen.

487
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,460
And it almost instantly what happened,

488
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,080
what you just described happened
as soon as the guy got in my face,

489
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,580
he like immediately within one,

490
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,270
within a half a second immediately
backed down and walked away.

491
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,820
It was like he was just
trying to prove something.

492
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,640
Then you realize really quick he was
going to get crushed. But anyways,

493
00:29:11,641 --> 00:29:16,530
that's the same thing. You
know, the guy could tell, oh
you want to fight, you know,

494
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,290
if you're telling that
story about Euler Euler,

495
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,070
Gracie coiler told me this story and I
guess you know when there's a really good

496
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:28,071
surfer and Euler was out surfing at
a spot in San Diego and San Diego,

497
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:33,180
like all surfing areas is, is pretty um,
territory, territorial. And there's some,

498
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,470
there's some are some aggression
in the surf. And anyways,

499
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,670
some guy started getting aggressive with,

500
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,710
with boiler and oh and they're
said to him some classic line.

501
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,000
It was something along the lines of,
hey man,

502
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,580
you surf for a living. I fight for a
living. If you want to go to the beach,

503
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,460
let me know.
Otherwise be quiet.

504
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,750
I thought that was a great
line. Nicely done. Holding

505
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,300
bread this time we went up.
But it's the same, you know,

506
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,180
boilers small for those of
you who don't know who boiler,

507
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:10,870
Gracie isn't wholly there is a small
small guy and he's obviously a master of

508
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:15,400
Jujitsu but he's only 150 pounds,
155 pounds maybe.

509
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,850
Really small guy. And he's a
nice guy. So he's not a guy that,

510
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,250
he's not a guy that's going
to be intimidated. He's not,

511
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:24,460
he's not his looks are not
going to intimidate anybody.

512
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:26,620
I don't even think he has
cauliflower ears. I mean it's just,

513
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,720
he just looks like a nice guy and he is
a nice guy and he's got a nice presence

514
00:30:31,721 --> 00:30:36,160
about him. So what I'm saying is what
again, to reinforce what you just said,

515
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:40,030
when someone is confident to that level,

516
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,440
even though there are 145 or 150 pounds
and look like a nice guy with a smile on

517
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:47,860
her face, when you confidently say, look,
you know what I do for living, I fight.

518
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:51,640
If you want to go to the beach and
fight, let me know. And the guy says, Oh,

519
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,920
you know what? I'm good. I'm
good. I'll just leave you alone.

520
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:54,940
That sounds like a plan.

521
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,080
Yeah, the little detector
goes off like danger, danger.

522
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:03,680
I'm going to get my ass beat.
But, and some, but some guys are,

523
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,250
as far as decision making goes,
some guys are crazy.

524
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:10,970
You know where like how you said like
if they're like on drugs or this guy in

525
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:14,540
this case if you sit in the middle of
the road acting like you know boys in the

526
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,970
hood kind. We've got a problem here.
That's what he said he was doing.

527
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,070
Like he's obviously off, you know like
he's not a decision maker kind of thing.

528
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:25,340
So you know, if you jump into
a situ situation with them,

529
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,560
it's kind of unpredictable
in that weird way, you know?

530
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,843
Let me tell you something else.

531
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,500
Let's say the guy has a
gun or doesn't have a gun.

532
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:35,410
You had the moment to get away from
it. Yeah. If you thought he had a gun,

533
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,740
you get away from him, right? Let's
say you said, Oh you know what?

534
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:42,370
I'm going to confront him right now. So
you, let's say you get in a shootout,

535
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:47,080
you kill him. Guess what you got to
do now? You got to hire a lawyer,

536
00:31:47,081 --> 00:31:50,320
you got to hang up, you got to take a
break from work cause you're a copy.

537
00:31:50,321 --> 00:31:52,780
There's all these things,
so not worth it.

538
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:55,610
It's just a pain in the ass is what it is.
It's

539
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:00,200
almost like, I mean, maybe I'm wrong
here, but it's almost like you can't,

540
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,730
like what?
What's the thing,

541
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:06,620
what's the goal we're going for when
we go ask question today? What's the,

542
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:08,900
what's your reason why
your reason for doing this,

543
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,620
I'm going to go out and look for,
I'm going to look for the guy,

544
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,700
but then like what's the goal?
Like what's the outlook?

545
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,420
What are we going for there when we go
look for him to tell him not to do that

546
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:21,360
again or to what? To arrest them or
to kick his ass or belief, right.

547
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,650
What's going on. Yeah. And then even
that you don't, a lot of times we don't.

548
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,980
I know when you're in that moment, you
don't think past that. You're just like,

549
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:31,790
I gotta get my whatever,
my revenge really is what it is.

550
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:32,750
He shouldn't have done that to me.

551
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,780
I'm going to go teach them a lesson kind
of a thing. I mean, that's the feeling.

552
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,900
I don't know. Yeah, but
guys are weird, man.

553
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,150
You can jump into that weirdness spreads.

554
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:44,810
Go home with your family and watch
when the confrontation happens.

555
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:48,910
The best case scenario isn't good. The
best case scenario, if you jump in there,

556
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,970
just the best case scenario that's
going to happen. It isn't good. Yeah,

557
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:58,220
because you got, even if you walk up and
knock the guy out with one clean punch,

558
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,030
you got to, you got a broken finger,
you know you've got a broken knuckle.

559
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,660
Even if you walk up and choke the guy,
you got his grimy puke all over it.

560
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:07,870
You know what I mean?
It's just there.

561
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,890
There's nothing that good is going to
come out of it other than it feels good to

562
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:13,724
fight.

563
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,410
But that can easily be remedied by
going to the gym and finding all of your

564
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:21,920
buddies. And in this case, I don't
know, you know this guy, oh, you,

565
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:26,120
you'd knocked out a weird homeless
guy in the, in the middle of the road,

566
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:29,160
in front of your family. Like I don't
see how that's cool. Yeah, I know that.

567
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,730
I mean, maybe, I don't know if that
would feel good. I don't think so. Yeah.

568
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,960
But yeah, it's kind of weird. This
one time we went on this cruise

569
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,850
and it was me, Terry, Tim, you know,
it's kind of like Terry's huge,

570
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,390
like I'm kind of big or whatever.
Tim and art or girlfriends,

571
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:48,100
this guy was behind us in the booth. We
were at a restaurant or something and um,

572
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:52,190
we were like, what are, I guess the booths
were flimsy, so we're shaking the booth.

573
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:56,060
He was behind us. He got up
all crazy. It's like, Hey,

574
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,840
what did he say? He said,
yeah, you guys are big,

575
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,370
but you guys keep knocking the booth.

576
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,800
We're going to basically
called us out to a fight.

577
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:08,360
He had like tattoos everywhere on his
neck and stuff. And at first I was like,

578
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:11,150
man, is this good joking? Like
we're like, what's going on?

579
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:15,980
I was confused and to be honest, I was
like stunned. Like almost like I didn't,

580
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:20,090
this scenario was so foreign to me. Oh,
styling and not even know what to say.

581
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,960
I don't even know what everyone else
was doing. That's how stunned I was.

582
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,070
But then Tim, he was Kinda, he
stuck and stuff. So he was like,

583
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,310
it's just a series right now. He just
jumped out east that he likes stands up,

584
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:33,980
goes to final, but the guy was
a Weirdo. That's the thing.

585
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:37,280
It was like all of us big guys,
you know, and Tim was like,

586
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:38,900
he wasn't scared at all.
He was ready to fight.

587
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:42,500
So he gets in his face face there about
if I want us cruise by the way we're

588
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,400
fighting. You can't fight on a cruise.
No. So it's this big scene, you know,

589
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,010
and the guy like, he
was like, I don't know,

590
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:53,300
I guess he was ready to die or something
cause he was like Kinda down the fight

591
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:55,400
and guys came in like I think
broke it up or whatever.

592
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:58,250
We had to make this big report
and he was like this big thing.

593
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,370
So it was all just a pain in the
ass is basically what we're saying.

594
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:05,030
You're right. I'm saying like what
if we fought that guy, you know,

595
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,210
they taught him a lesson or what if Tim
father or whatever getting arrested and

596
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,930
you got a lawsuit against him
and we were on a cruise Zachary.

597
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,920
It's all stupid. Yeah, don't do
that. Can stuff. Next question.

598
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,750
Jackie loved the podcast part of the
question. Oh, thank you. Right on.

599
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,420
Any suggestions for leading command
staff to understanding the ground level

600
00:35:29,421 --> 00:35:32,390
troops in a mission?
Okay,

601
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:36,230
so for those of you that are not
in the military command staff,

602
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,040
that's sort of for the business world,
that would

603
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,640
be like corporate headquarters.
You know the corporate headquarters,

604
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,360
you've got the command
staff and it happens in both
situations where you end up

605
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:48,690
with,
with the command staff,

606
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:53,691
with the corporate headquarters
that kind of loses track of what,

607
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:57,270
what they're actually therefore
the ground level mission,

608
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,840
the troops that are on the ground.
And this is a tough question,

609
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,220
but it's also kind of a simple one.

610
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So I go back to trying to constantly
remind people what the mission is,

611
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,360
what are they trying to do. And I had to
the admiral and I was the admiral's aid.

612
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:16,260
I worked for the admiral, great
guy. And one of the things,

613
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,760
I've probably talked about this before,

614
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,090
but one of the best things
that he did was cause he's,

615
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,300
he's so detached from the seal platoons.

616
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,800
Like there's layer upon layer upon
layer in between him and them. And,

617
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,870
and actually believe it or not,

618
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:34,380
the job of the admiral that's
in charge of the seal teams,

619
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,060
this is gonna sound strange to everybody.

620
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:41,450
The job of the admiral that's in
charge of the seal teams is to

621
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:48,530
get equipment and gear and training for
the seal teams now and for like the next

622
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:56,430
10 years because that's the way the
budgetary process works in the Pentagon.

623
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:59,310
And there's so, so don't think
of when you think I know you,

624
00:36:59,311 --> 00:37:03,750
you want to think of the seal admiral
as the warfighter. Let's go in forward.

625
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,260
The guy that's actually in charge,
the senior seal.

626
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,660
Now there you can be a special operations
because there's other places you could

627
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:12,630
be, but the guy that's in
charge of the seals of,

628
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,110
of naval special warfare command,
that's what it's called,

629
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,900
naval special warfare command.
The adults in charge of that,

630
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:23,000
which puts them in charge of all
the seals. That guy, his main, his,

631
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,040
his job is to train and equip seals,

632
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,650
train and equip,

633
00:37:29,651 --> 00:37:33,660
not take them into battle but train and
equip and so you end up with this whole

634
00:37:33,661 --> 00:37:37,200
organization where the purpose of the
organization is to train and equip,

635
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:42,290
but the organization is huge and even
that command organization gets very big

636
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:47,220
and so what they start doing is they
start losing focus that 10 levels below

637
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:50,250
them out somewhere overseas is,

638
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,780
is an eight man squad and a Zodiac
off the coast of some nation.

639
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,370
Doing a reconnaissance is very,
they, they don't even think about,

640
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,830
they haven't thought about that for years
and so they lose track and it happens

641
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:05,790
in the corporate world as well
where the the the head shed that's,

642
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:08,340
they're dealing with stuff too, right?
They're dealing with legal problems,

643
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:10,170
they're dealing with compliance problems.

644
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,060
They're dealing with financial problems.

645
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,420
They lose track of the fact that there's
a guy on the front line that's trying

646
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:20,340
to fix a car or replace
a an air conditioner, you
know, that's the way it is.

647
00:38:20,341 --> 00:38:23,190
So you lose the vision of that,
you lose track of that.

648
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,990
So what was great about this animal
that I work for is in these big meetings

649
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,800
where they would be talking about s,
you know,

650
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,100
hundreds of millions of dollars of
expenditures over the next 12 years,

651
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,160
various training commands and all
this stuff. Huge. And he would always,

652
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,910
he would always say, how does this
impact a seal platoon overseas?

653
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,943
How does this,

654
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:49,950
how does this help a seal assaulter go
out and shoot a bad guy in the face?

655
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,710
That's what he would ask.
And that gives them snaps.

656
00:38:53,711 --> 00:38:58,230
Everybody snaps everybody back
into reality of what they're get.

657
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,270
It connects exactly what this question is.
Um,

658
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,470
suggestions for leading command staff to
understanding the ground level troops.

659
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:08,320
And you've got to ask that question and
the business side of seeing the same

660
00:39:08,321 --> 00:39:12,550
thing. You know, the guys totally lose
track of it. So, so you, you ended up,

661
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,760
you got to ask the question,
hey, everything that you're
talking about, you know,

662
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:19,420
this, this compliance thing
and this regulatory thing
and this new software that

663
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:20,800
you're talking about.
Let me ask you a question.

664
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,030
How is this going to help one of our
frontline sales people close a deal?

665
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,160
That's the question.
That's the whole reason that we're here.

666
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,650
The whole reason that
this big staff is here,

667
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,360
the whole reason we have this building,

668
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:40,530
the whole reason we have this base is so
that a seal overseas can close with and

669
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:43,000
destroy the enemy or so,

670
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:48,080
or if we're in a big corporation is so
that this repairman can make it to a,

671
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,620
a house and fix an electrical
problem in a short period of time,

672
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,040
efficiently and effectively.
That's what we're all here for.

673
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,890
So I think that's what you have to do.

674
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:03,160
You have to keep reminding them of
what's going on down on the phone lines,

675
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,040
what the mission is, what the men
are doing, what issues are out there.

676
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:10,870
Another thing you could take is you want
to take these people with you or you

677
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,360
want to get anecdotal information.
That's, I know it's cheap,

678
00:40:13,361 --> 00:40:15,700
it's cheap to do this,

679
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,450
but you go out and you gather anecdotal
information that you can bring back to

680
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:22,540
headquarters and say, Hey, you know what?
I know we're all doing a good job here.

681
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:25,570
Let me tell you, the troops on the ground
need this cold weather gear right now.

682
00:40:25,571 --> 00:40:27,670
They don't have it. Here's
a, here's a message.

683
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:30,760
I just got bumped from a guy overseas.
They're up in northern Iraq.

684
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,210
We thought it was going to be warm.
Guess what? It's 32 degrees there.

685
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,270
Snow on the ground. These guys aren't
prepared for it. We need to get into gear.

686
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,630
Okay,
so you're using anecdotal information to,

687
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,260
to paint the picture of what's going
on in the front lines. Same thing with,

688
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:44,621
you know,

689
00:40:44,621 --> 00:40:47,770
if you're a corporate guy and you
want to make sure people stay engaged,

690
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,310
go out on a call with that electrician
that's visited in a house on a,

691
00:40:51,311 --> 00:40:53,320
on it where there's been
a break or have blown.

692
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:57,520
And the guys working through the payment
system that you devise that you thought

693
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:58,181
was so smart,

694
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:01,000
it doesn't get connection while you're
out in the field and now he can't run a

695
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:04,570
credit card. You want to come back and
tell them, tell the head shed that.

696
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,020
So those are some of the things.

697
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:11,620
Another thing that you could do is you
asked those questions all the time and

698
00:41:11,621 --> 00:41:14,350
maybe you just come up with some kind
of a mantra that you repeat all the time

699
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:17,140
and that you sign your emails with. It
says, you know, we're here to support,

700
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,920
we're here to support the front line guys.
We're here for the front line.

701
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:24,640
You know, or ask yourself the question,
does this help the front line?

702
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,910
Every decision that we make, we got to ask
herself, does this help our front line?

703
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,240
Does this help our frontline personnel?
Um,

704
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,580
and I think that's what you gotta do.
Now.

705
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:36,470
One thing that you've
gotta be ready for on this,

706
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,930
you gotta be ready for someone to say,
Dave, don't understand the big picture.

707
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,080
This is what you got to be ready for it.
Cause I've heard this well,

708
00:41:45,081 --> 00:41:47,750
who's going to say that? Corporate.
Oh you go to the corner and say, look,

709
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:50,120
you know we've got the guys on the front
lines. We need to get them this gear.

710
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,890
And they go, look, they don't
understand the big picture.

711
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:56,990
We can't afford that right now. We didn't
look okay. I hear what you're saying.

712
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,620
But be ready for it.
It's an excuse.

713
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,800
It's an excuse and you gotta be ready
for it in the way that you get ready for

714
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,390
it. I've talked about this and they only
get in times the way you get ready for,

715
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,270
as you have ammunition,
you have ammunition.

716
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:09,290
You've got to have your ducks in a row.

717
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,400
If you're going to raise
your hand and say, Hey,

718
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:13,010
here's what's going on the front lines,
here's, here's a problem that they have.

719
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,980
You can't, but you can't just
back down. When they say, hey,

720
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:18,340
they don't know what's going on. They
don't get it. They don't get the bill.

721
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:21,110
That's a big thing. They say in the
military, they don't get the big picture.

722
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,940
I would hear that threaten and say,
you know what,

723
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,210
actually we do get the big picture.
We're living the big picture.

724
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,900
You don't get the big picture.
Here's the big picture.

725
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:34,520
I got frontline troopers that need cold
weather gear or they're going to freeze

726
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,110
and not be able to operate. The picture
doesn't get any bigger than that.

727
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,840
Now you can't call it of course,

728
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:44,300
come across like that and which you
have to do is you have to look at it

729
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:46,220
systematically and over
a long term and say,

730
00:42:46,221 --> 00:42:49,220
this is about plan and I've got a plan
for the long term of how are we gonna get

731
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:50,630
these guys as cold weather
gear in the future.

732
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:51,800
But right now we've got a little fixed.

733
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:53,390
It's going to cover these guys
that are in the field right now.

734
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:57,440
You've got to come armed with
ammunition so that you can,

735
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:03,050
you can refute this.
Common call that gets made,

736
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:05,160
which is they don't understand
the big picture out in the field,

737
00:43:05,161 --> 00:43:06,530
so don't worry about them.
No.

738
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,470
The only reason we're here is
for those guys in the field.

739
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:10,790
So what's her number them?

740
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:13,323
That's pretty good.

741
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:17,823
Next question.

742
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:25,130
You talk about stepping back or
detaching to better assess situations.

743
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,650
Can you expand on how

744
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,070
you detach?

745
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,490
Okay, so this is again, this is
one I've been asked. I probably,

746
00:43:33,491 --> 00:43:37,090
even if I answered this before,
yes. Should we just skip it?

747
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,650
Uh, no. I think it's worth it, you
know? Okay, I'll, I'll go over.

748
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,100
I'll go over quickly since people ask
me all the time. Okay. First of all,

749
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,120
you wanted to attach step back,
literally step back.

750
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,940
If you're online with a bunch
of people in a combat situation,

751
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,780
literally step back. If you're, if
you're in a combat situation, high port,

752
00:43:55,781 --> 00:43:59,350
your weapon, your weapon at the seat,
at the roof, at the sky, whatever,

753
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,170
you're not going to engage in your target.
You're gonna step back. If you're in a,

754
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,340
if you're in a business environment,
step away from the computer,

755
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,930
step away from the terminal,
put down your pen back away.

756
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:14,020
There's a year and a meeting,
heated meeting you need to attach,

757
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,470
stand up back away from the table, but
it's literally stand back and step away.

758
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:22,550
Once you do that, you,
you relax. Now that,

759
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,580
that physical part that I just talked
about, it literally stepping back,

760
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,150
that's something that it's a,

761
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,470
it's a physical reminder of what to do.

762
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,500
You can get to a point in your life
where you don't need to do that. Yeah.

763
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,980
Or where you usually
don't have to do that,

764
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,460
but things can still escalate quickly
to where even the most highly trained

765
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,270
detached person still lasts
it step back and take up,

766
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:53,070
take a wrap off and take a look around.
So in most of these situations is,

767
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,270
especially when you're first starting
to try and do it physically, step back,

768
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,860
physically do something that indicates
to you as a person and it actually

769
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:03,600
indicates to everyone around
you that you're doing this.

770
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:06,360
Like when somebody stands up from the
table and steps back. It's an indicator.

771
00:45:06,361 --> 00:45:09,170
Okay. He's, he's taking the wrap off,
right? You're Madec we get it. Yeah.

772
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,440
Actually we're trying not to be dramatic,
but it's going to be dramatic anyway.

773
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:16,680
It is now. Take a breath, take a breath,

774
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,210
look around and make a call.
That's, that's it. That's
how easy it is to detach.

775
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:26,211
Now the actual hard part of detachment
is being self aware enough that you know

776
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,780
when to detach the,
that's the,

777
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:34,560
that's the challenging part because they
end up in this situation. By the time,

778
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,870
by the time they go, man, I should
have detached. Yeah, that's right.

779
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:39,090
You should have detached. You lost
your temper. You got involved.

780
00:45:39,091 --> 00:45:40,230
He couldn't make a decision.

781
00:45:40,231 --> 00:45:44,430
You got dragged into the
weeds like everybody else
did. It's it's, if somebody,

782
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:45,180
if I would have,

783
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,310
and I've done this plenty of times
when I was training seal platoons,

784
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,040
I would just go up to the leader who
was getting dragged her situation.

785
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,300
I'd be like, Hey, step back with me.

786
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:54,870
I'd take them two steps off the line
of like look around and then they'd be

787
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:59,010
easily be able to make a decision.
That's the, that's the easy part.

788
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:01,230
The easy part is step.
Stepping back.

789
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:05,850
The hard part is knowing that you
need to do it because it's like,

790
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,050
I guess it's, and then to use the
stupid analogy of the boiling frog,

791
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:13,710
right where you put a bowl, you put a frog
in water, you slowly start to boil it.

792
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:15,720
Next thing you know it's next
thing get knows it's dead.

793
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:18,300
It didn't realize that though where if
you throw it into hot water it would just

794
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:21,630
try and jump out immediately. It's
the same thing here. You don't,

795
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,180
you'll get walk into a room
and the chaos is going on. No,

796
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:26,640
you walk into the room and everything
seems okay and then it starts to escalate,

797
00:46:26,641 --> 00:46:26,941
escalate,

798
00:46:26,941 --> 00:46:29,580
escalate and next thing you know you're
in it and next thing you know something

799
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,420
bad has happened and you
didn't detach and time.

800
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,500
So you lost the bubble and you lost
control and everything went sideways.

801
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:39,000
So you got to know when you got to
understand when it is you needed to adapt.

802
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:42,420
You've got to have your own personal
red flags to tell you that it's time to

803
00:46:42,421 --> 00:46:45,810
relax. When you feel yourself
getting frustrated, we just
start getting like that.

804
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:46,980
You needed to detach.
When you feel you're,

805
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,040
if you're getting foster
to go back cut to detach,

806
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:51,820
you've started feeling the anger,

807
00:46:51,821 --> 00:46:56,820
you're feeling the white knuckles or
you start pecking hard at the keyboard,

808
00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:01,800
right? Right. When you type an email out
and you're hitting the keyboard hard,

809
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,390
that's an indicator to cater for you
better not hit send because whatever you

810
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:10,230
wrote isn't good. It's not going to solve
any problems. You're raised voice, right?

811
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:13,200
You start raising the voice. You start
getting angry and agro with people.

812
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,480
Those are the little things.

813
00:47:15,481 --> 00:47:20,481
Those are the little indicators
that tell you you need to detach.

814
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,080
Step back, take a breath, look
around, walk out of the room,

815
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:30,070
put your weapon at high
port. Just relax. Look

816
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:34,360
around. Make a call. One
more thing. Sometimes.

817
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,020
Sometimes what?
What?

818
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,500
The reason you need to detach is just so
you can see something from a different

819
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:47,650
angle and you can ask a question. I
love, I personally love doing this.

820
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,960
I'm in a in a meeting,
right?

821
00:47:49,961 --> 00:47:53,920
And I work with a bunch of businesses
and it actually gets pretty, you know,

822
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:58,921
I'm getting involved in what they're
doing and they'll be all basically staring

823
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:00,550
at a problem,
right?

824
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:03,250
Staring at a problem and they
can't figure out what the solution,

825
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:05,710
whether it's a leadership
problem or a process problem,

826
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:10,630
and they're all staring at this problem
and they can't come to a solution while

827
00:48:10,631 --> 00:48:13,060
I come in. First of all, I'm
totally detached, right? It's,

828
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:17,680
it's one of the benefits of my job is
I'm totally detached. So when I come in,

829
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,050
a lot of times my,

830
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:24,010
what I bring to the situation of what
I can see is I can just ask a question

831
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:29,011
that none of them could think to ask
because they're all looking in the same

832
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:33,580
direction. As soon as you flank that
idea, you see it from a different angle.

833
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,530
You come up with a solution.
So,

834
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,800
so what I'm my point in this is don't
only use detachment to prevent your

835
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:45,520
emotions from driving your decisions.

836
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:51,060
Also use detachment as part
of your creative process
to detach from your current

837
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:00,960
thought pattern and move to a new thought
pattern where you can create new ideas

838
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,180
and different plans from different angles
that we're not seen from your previous

839
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,140
vantage point.

840
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,520
Good. I guess we did get a little bit
out of that to dance meant there. Yeah.

841
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:24,990
Revisit revisitation

842
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:28,603
next question.

843
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:36,130
How to deal with people who use military
vets status to excuse bad behavior in

844
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,660
civilian world.
Yeah.

845
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:45,140
This is an unfortunate one to have
to answer and it unfortunately,

846
00:49:45,141 --> 00:49:48,380
I have to start it off with the same
way I made this point about Jujitsu and

847
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:53,010
Jujitsu practice practitioners not
necessarily being good people. Oh yeah.

848
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,640
Unfortunately it's the
same thing with veterans.

849
00:49:55,641 --> 00:49:57,980
Just like it's the same thing
in every aspect of life.

850
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:03,610
Just because someone is a veteran does
not mean that they are a good person and

851
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,120
being at war is certainly not
an excuse for bad behavior.

852
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,150
And I,
couple of examples,

853
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:18,530
couple of examples just
to think about major,

854
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,450
Major Kurt Chu evenly.
You remember this guy,

855
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,990
navy cross. This is the guy that
wore the pink at at in John's,

856
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:32,120
so his men could identify him. The
enemy, you can identify him clearly too,

857
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,260
but he was the leader.
He saw hell right.

858
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:40,880
Wounded men died. 27 of his men
made it. I mean, just ridiculous.

859
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,690
Guess what he did when he,
when he got out of the Marine Corps,

860
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,020
went to work for an insurance
company for 20 years. Right?

861
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:54,410
So Joe Owen, Joe Owen, who,

862
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,160
you know, same, same
chosen reservoir battle,

863
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:02,210
never regain the use of the,
of his arm that was wounded,

864
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,190
was medically retired
from the marine corps.

865
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:09,050
Guess what he did with all
that [inaudible] horror.
Guess what he did? Yeah.

866
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,960
He created and ran his own
marketing business until I retired.

867
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,293
Hmm.

868
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,930
Now you remember John
Chafee from that book,

869
00:51:17,931 --> 00:51:22,090
the coldest war.
He was the captain that I kind of wanted.

870
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:25,850
The reason I did that book was cause he
was profiled in there and he just was a

871
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,610
great leader. Well, I, I
don't even know if I were,

872
00:51:28,611 --> 00:51:30,560
I don't remember if I talked about this,

873
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,690
but he turned 20 years old at
the bottle of Guadalcanal, right?

874
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,160
World War II. He fought at [inaudible]
World War II. Then he went to,

875
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,910
went back and went to school with,
I went to either Yale or Harvard or both,

876
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:47,630
but then Korea kicked off. So then
went to Korea and got after it more.

877
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,160
So all of this war, what did he do
with all that? And came home, you know,

878
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:55,100
became the mayor of Providence there
and Rhode Island became the governor of

879
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:57,650
Rhode Island and they became
secretary of the navy. But so

880
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:04,180
my point in saying these things
is veterans are not broken humans.

881
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:09,020
They're not deranged people.
They're just people.

882
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,630
And they've seen some stuff in,

883
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:16,310
most of them are Gary on and do awesome.
The greatest generation,

884
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,380
they get a good, great generation
holds a World War II vets.

885
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,620
They saw horrors of war. Guess what
they did? Came home and dominated.

886
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,113
That's what they did.

887
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:28,630
So men and women can overcome
the impact of war or,

888
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,810
or at least they can learn to work with
it. Because even if you, you know, you,

889
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,650
even if you have those things
that stress you out, okay,

890
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:41,390
but guys learn how to deal with it.
Of course that being said,

891
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,253
war,

892
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:47,830
it does leave a mark and obviously
sometimes it can have a extremely negative

893
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,633
effect.

894
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,900
So if you know someone like that,

895
00:52:56,930 --> 00:53:01,610
well let's get those veterans some help
if they need it in and get them some

896
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:05,510
support. Also make sure you're
not enabling this bad behavior.

897
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:07,640
This is what you don't want to do.
You don't want it.

898
00:53:07,641 --> 00:53:12,230
You don't want to enable
this bad behavior. The vets
that I meet, they're there,

899
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,030
they're fired up,
they're not,

900
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:16,640
they're not complaining about
anything they're getting after it.

901
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,060
Don't enable the bad behavior.
It doesn't help anyone.

902
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:27,450
And it's one of those things that it,
it might make you feel better.

903
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:30,180
It might make me feel better to, to
help someone out and say, Hey, no,

904
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:31,860
I understand cause you know,
here's,

905
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,900
let me enable your binge
eating behavior some more.

906
00:53:33,901 --> 00:53:36,480
And it might make me feel better cause
I feel like I've done a good deed.

907
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:39,630
But you haven't done a good deed.
You've actually not helped them at all.

908
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,341
That's one thing.

909
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:46,140
I think that's good if you find other
vets for them to talk to because other

910
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:49,560
vets will say, man, I
understand bro. It's okay,

911
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,160
but let's not dwell on that past stuff.
Let's move forward.

912
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,230
This guy's offering you
a job or this guy has a,

913
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:59,370
a job for you to do or this guy has
a position you can feel do that.

914
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:04,200
Do that. Don't dwell on the past.
The past is gone. Wars. Hell,

915
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,650
I know now let's live in the heaven we
got here in the United States of America.

916
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:13,740
Let's, let's take advantage of
that and not dwell on the past.

917
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,300
You know what this is.
This is another small thing,

918
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:21,900
but I just hear so much
about it. Um, from people.

919
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,500
If you got somebody having
listen to the podcast,

920
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,270
to this podcast a year from a vet,

921
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,300
every single day I hear from vets
around America that are like,

922
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:37,200
hey man, thanks. Thanks for having the
podcast. Thanks for what you talk about.

923
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,070
I get it, Bree. She ate it. Okay.
I just, you guys just, you know,

924
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:46,200
sent me a message today. He's like, look
man, I didn't have a gun in my mouth,

925
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:51,210
but he goes, I wasn't doing good. I'm on
track. I'm trained in Jujitsu. Literally,

926
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,080
I'm trying to Jujitsu, I'm in the
gym. I'm busting my ass and my job.

927
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:58,140
Appreciate it. That's all
it is. That's all it is.

928
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:01,560
Cause I think when people
listen, when vets listen, the
podcast, they go, okay, cool.

929
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:05,730
There's other people, they know
we're, we're in the game together.

930
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,540
They feel that they feel that connection
and they know that they're not alone

931
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:14,430
because that's the thing that's
jacked up. Man. Veterans that get,

932
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,830
they go to war and they come back and
they go somewhere there where they're just

933
00:55:16,831 --> 00:55:21,660
not, there's no one there. Yeah. And
all this is, is a big bullshit session.

934
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,310
You know what I mean? Between, you know,

935
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,180
a veteran that's in a book and I'm
having a bullshit vet, a session with,

936
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:32,550
with Joe Ellen, you know, that's what
it is. And so I think guys, veterans,

937
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:35,880
they hear that and they go,
yeah man, I appreciate it.

938
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,450
So have them listen to the podcast and,

939
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:45,150
and that might be helpful to get them
feeling like they're not alone out there.

940
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:50,580
Yeah, I would think that that's the
main thing. Like people don't like,

941
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:54,370
you don't understand me, you
know, you don't understand like,

942
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:56,920
I mean,
not to sound too self,

943
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,660
but like you don't understand how I feel
about this. And even day to day stuff,

944
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:05,100
like the way I'm seeing this right now,
you don't understand. Yeah. So yeah,

945
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:05,934
you ended up feeling like,

946
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,480
I'm assuming that's what it seems like
you guys ended up feeling alone and

947
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:10,314
they're out there and they're like,

948
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,620
and the other thing is they feel
like people don't understand me.

949
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:18,910
I'm here saying, you're right. They
don't, they haven't been to war. And the,

950
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,900
the experience of war is all over
the place. I mean, I wouldn't even,

951
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,510
I wouldn't even, I would shine, you know,

952
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:31,620
I would shine major Kurt Chu inlays boots
every day for the rest of my life if I

953
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:37,010
had the opportunity to, like that guy has
expired. I mean, just, I, I'm not gonna,

954
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:40,480
I'm not even the same ballpark. You know
what I mean? Not even the same clothes,

955
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,800
not clothes for what those
guys went through it,

956
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:46,000
that shows reservoir and it goes
all the way down to some guy that,

957
00:56:46,001 --> 00:56:48,610
you know was overseas
that was in the military,

958
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:50,920
didn't even deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.
Not Their fault.

959
00:56:50,921 --> 00:56:54,130
They might've wanted to, but sometimes
he just doesn't happen. Yeah. So the,

960
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,250
the military experiences,

961
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:57,910
all those things and you don't
know what you're dealing with.

962
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:02,860
But one thing we do know is that it
is a common experience, you know,

963
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:05,710
going to war.
It does have some common threads to it.

964
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:10,390
And I think that it is hard for people
that haven't experienced it to understand,

965
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,390
and it makes people feel a
little bit like alone out there.

966
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:18,520
So when they hear other vets talking
about what goes on, they go, yeah man,

967
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:19,443
all right,
cool.

968
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:23,290
These are not abnormal feelings that
I'm having and they can move on.

969
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:26,560
And I don't know if I've really
answered the question of,

970
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:31,330
of how to deal with people who use their
status as an excuse to bad behavior.

971
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,910
I think just like any, anyone else, man,

972
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:36,400
you gotta you gotta do your
best to put them in their place.

973
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:40,450
And I think what makes non veterans
feel intimidated. And when I was a kid,

974
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,920
I looked up to all the Vietnam
veterans and I just thought these guys,

975
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:47,590
whatever they, they could do
no wrong in my eyes. You know,

976
00:57:47,591 --> 00:57:51,430
when I was a kid it's not,
that guy's awesome that goes
and I was a non, you know,

977
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,690
that guy could do no wrong.

978
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:56,200
And I think that's a feeling
that a lot of civilians have.

979
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,250
Like they don't want to approach the
subject. And if you feel that way,

980
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:04,900
it's understandable. It's hard. But
find some vets around that can help you,

981
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:08,110
that can, it can help that person that
can talk to them about what they're doing.

982
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,550
I mean, you know, every
company that I work with,

983
00:58:10,551 --> 00:58:13,240
there's veterans in every company.
I work with some, you know,

984
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,930
usually have multiple veterans,
so find some other vendors.

985
00:58:16,931 --> 00:58:20,140
A lot of the one thing that's another
cool thing that the companies do is within

986
00:58:20,141 --> 00:58:25,141
their company they'll have like a veteran
program or a veteran club basically

987
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:29,440
inside their company. That's another cool
thing. Do that, get that thing started.

988
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:30,730
You know,
even if you're not a vet,

989
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:33,250
find the senior vet or the
vet that's fired up to do it.

990
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:35,860
Bring him in and then those
guys can get together,

991
00:58:35,861 --> 00:58:38,590
talk and talk about doing better and talk
about bringing some of their military

992
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:41,290
experience to bear in the company
and it just will turn out good.

993
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,510
So there's little veterans organizations,
that's what they call them.

994
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:45,910
Veterans organizations inside
of companies are pretty cool.

995
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,040
I've spoken to a few of them.
It's a pretty cool deal.
All right, next question.

996
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,180
How does default aggressive
apply to Jujitsu?

997
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,140
Or does it apply to judge
it? Well, good question now.

998
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:07,810
Well,
first of all,

999
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,910
it doesn't apply during training.

1000
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:14,763
Okay.
It,

1001
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,860
but it completely applies
during competition and
obviously it applies in the

1002
00:59:20,441 --> 00:59:22,340
streets.
So,

1003
00:59:23,970 --> 00:59:28,610
so this is what I mean by
that is in training it's
okay to get in bad positions.

1004
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:30,950
It's okay to let things happen.

1005
00:59:30,951 --> 00:59:34,430
It's okay let somebody grabbed that
color or grab that sleeve or get across

1006
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:37,870
sites. Okay. I mean those, it's okay to
put yourself at risk in competitions.

1007
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,130
That's okay. Matter of fact, it's,

1008
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,280
it's encouraged in a lot of
weight training and training.

1009
00:59:43,281 --> 00:59:44,870
It's encouraged in training,

1010
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,320
but in competition you
can't do that. You, you can,

1011
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:53,300
you can not do that in street.

1012
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:57,860
You definitely cannot do that.
And in fact, in the street,

1013
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:03,080
you've got to proactively and
aggressively, first of all,

1014
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:05,690
avoid the bad situation.
But if they come,

1015
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:09,650
then you've got to handle those
situations with aggression and speed and

1016
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,020
violence of action.
That's what you gotta do.

1017
01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:17,620
So competition is kind of
the same way in competition.

1018
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,390
If you give a guy an inch, if you give a
guy a grip, if you give a guy a position,

1019
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,100
they will not, they will not let go
of it. It's not happening. They will.

1020
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,800
They will hang on to that thing like,

1021
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:33,350
like would the ghee in competition,

1022
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,440
somebody gets a grip on some part of
your di they white knuckle that thing.

1023
01:00:39,831 --> 01:00:43,550
Especially especially in the lower belts.
What he, it's the higher belts too, man.

1024
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:46,070
It's every belt because that,
gee,

1025
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:50,150
that grip can be the difference
between winning and losing period.

1026
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:55,760
So you, you got to, you got
to aggressively avoid that.

1027
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:59,030
You've got to be aggressive with your
positions. Now in training, again,

1028
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:01,250
you let it happen. But here's
something that can happen in training.

1029
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,070
Sometimes you get guys that get used to
training and they go into competition.

1030
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:08,810
I get overrun. They get overwhelmed
and overrun because they thought, man,

1031
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,460
I'll just, oh, the guy grabs my color,

1032
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:13,450
they Jocko grabs my color all
every time we roll. Right?

1033
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,360
And they don't realize that when this guy
grabs your color, he's going to attack.

1034
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:23,360
And so what you have to do and the
other thing is in, in a competition,

1035
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:28,280
there's a time limit because there
is, there is kind of a, a uh,

1036
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:34,010
there's such a thing sort of as a counter
puncher in Jujitsu, right? Someone that,

1037
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,700
and I'm kind of like
that, right? Like I don't,

1038
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:40,430
I don't usually force a move to happen.

1039
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:42,470
Usually I'm going to let
you make your own mistakes.

1040
01:01:42,471 --> 01:01:46,100
I'm going to let my opponent make a bad
move and then I'm going to capitalize on

1041
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:48,650
it. He uses a lot less work
for me. I mean it's, it's,

1042
01:01:48,651 --> 01:01:51,410
it's a lot less work when
your opponent gives you,

1043
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,820
gives you the submission or gives you the
transition or gives you the sweep then

1044
01:01:55,821 --> 01:02:00,080
trying to make it happen.
But again,

1045
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:01,250
in competition

1046
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,350
it doesn't really work because
they're not going to give,

1047
01:02:06,351 --> 01:02:07,430
they're not going to take any risk.

1048
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:09,510
They're not going to take any risk and
there's probably not going to be any

1049
01:02:09,511 --> 01:02:13,630
openings. Now again, another piece of
this long match. Maybe my, you know,

1050
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,490
maybe I'm just trying to hire
somebody out now in the gym.

1051
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:20,460
I have an unlimited time to do that.
I can somebody out for 20 minutes,

1052
01:02:20,461 --> 01:02:24,270
just try to let them pass my guard and
they're trying to pass my guard the whole

1053
01:02:24,271 --> 01:02:25,710
time I'm getting,
I'm tired of getting them tired,

1054
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:28,080
getting them trying to find the, they
expose himself. Boom. I put the choke on.

1055
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,410
Good. I win. That took 20 minutes.

1056
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,110
This happens on a daily
basis in a competition.

1057
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:39,060
I just lost because it was a 10 minute
match and the other guy was on top for 10

1058
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:43,380
minutes trying to pass and he got the
advantage and he wins. So you can't,

1059
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,220
that can't be your strategy
if there's no time limit.

1060
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:51,300
It's the same thing in war, right?
In war. You can have a strategy of,

1061
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,620
I'm just going to where the other
personnel, I mean the, the, the Va, uh,

1062
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:57,090
Vietnamese data to America, right.
They just kind of wore us out.

1063
01:02:57,450 --> 01:03:01,560
Look at what the Russian strategy
of that they used against Napoleon.

1064
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:03,930
They used against the Nazis. Oh,
you want to come out of school,

1065
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:06,840
we're just going to back up a little bit
at a time, back up, a little bit of time,

1066
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:08,040
backup a little bit time.

1067
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:12,130
Here comes the winter in and now you're
going to freeze to death and we're going

1068
01:03:12,131 --> 01:03:15,570
to surround junior and kill you.
But that's the same type of strategy.

1069
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:19,650
It doesn't work if you, if you have
a limited amount of time to win,

1070
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:24,870
you have to have, if you, if you
have a limited amount of time,

1071
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:29,760
which most cases you do, you have to
have a default aggressive attitude in.

1072
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:32,760
Make things happen the way
you want them to happen,

1073
01:03:32,761 --> 01:03:35,610
not the way your opponent wants to happen,
to have them happen,

1074
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,740
not the way your enemy
wants them to happen.

1075
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:43,890
And it's the same thing obviously
in business and in life,

1076
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,440
the good things, the good
positions, the good details,

1077
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:51,960
the good promotions,
the rewards,

1078
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,110
they're not going to come
and knock on your door.

1079
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:58,090
You got to go out and
you got to take them.

1080
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,700
You got to make them happen on the mat,

1081
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,000
in business and in life.

1082
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,390
So get default aggressive.
So my recommendation. Yeah,

1083
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:17,391
it's weird and Jujitsu is still ambiguous
as far as like a like an art and

1084
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:21,030
there's like this big spectrum
and there's all these exceptions.

1085
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:24,390
You know how you see the
counter puncher and you did too,

1086
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:29,070
where like some guys even like making,

1087
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:34,071
you can be a counter puncher in Jujitsu
and still be like aggressive bite.

1088
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:37,020
So your first move won't be like,
okay, if you're going for a sleep,

1089
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:40,260
your first move won't be
to sweep. You'll go, okay,

1090
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:41,430
I'm going to do this other thing.

1091
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,690
I know his reaction is going to open
him up for the sweep. Well for sure,

1092
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,220
for sure. That's, that's, that's covered
move. Actually it's covering move.

1093
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,580
It's flanking flanking violas.
Yeah,

1094
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:58,250
because you know I start attacking your
neck and you pull your hand up to defend

1095
01:04:58,251 --> 01:05:01,470
it. Boom. That took your base away. I'm
sweeping you. Right, right. Boom. That's,

1096
01:05:01,471 --> 01:05:02,310
that's what it was.

1097
01:05:02,311 --> 01:05:06,600
It was a cover move covering my
actual attack with my other move.

1098
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:10,170
Or you can call it a flank because you
think I'm going to come at the front,

1099
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,800
but then I'm flanking you from
the side with the sweep. Yeah.

1100
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,690
When you put all your chips on
the front, you know? Yeah. It's,

1101
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,730
it's almost like that's
like a philosophical

1102
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,900
question where you can answer it as
it applies to something specific.

1103
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,410
So like for example, like default
aggressive in Jujitsu, meaning

1104
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:36,180
my default aggressive way of approaching
it will give me advantage in this way

1105
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,470
where I'm going to impose my game or
whether that's the counter punching game,

1106
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:44,450
whether it's the wear him out for a
while game, whether it's, you know,

1107
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,320
overrunning with my conditioning,
whatever that game is,

1108
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:50,800
I'm going to aggressively put it on
him before he puts it on me. Default.

1109
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:54,040
Like right from the time
the guy says go or you know,

1110
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:56,830
when it goes down the street,
whenever, even in training,

1111
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,520
whatever you're training
like that if you want.

1112
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:05,860
So that'll keep him in the defensive
where he can't get his game going on you,

1113
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:09,310
you know, he's defending your game
the whole time. Yeah. You definitely,

1114
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:12,280
definitely want to impose your will
and say that all the time with the UFC

1115
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:13,140
fighters.
You,

1116
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:16,690
the UFC fighter that imposes his well
on the other fighters are going to win.

1117
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,750
Yeah. They're going to win. And
it's the same thing with war.

1118
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,390
You impose your will on the enemy.
That's what you do.

1119
01:06:22,450 --> 01:06:26,050
You impose your will on the enemy
and you'll break them. Yeah man.

1120
01:06:26,051 --> 01:06:27,820
That's why you see guys like in USC,

1121
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,280
they'll don't front of the
middle of the ring, you know,

1122
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:33,380
cause they're like controlling during
or like a Bj Penn would all be,

1123
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,390
if he's coaching somebody, he'd be like,
be first be first before you put them.

1124
01:06:37,391 --> 01:06:40,810
So the guy got to defend the whole time.
And when you,

1125
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,010
when you're going against the striker,

1126
01:06:42,011 --> 01:06:46,770
that ad has that attitude and
is being first. Oh it's not fun.

1127
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:50,320
They're hitting you and you're not. You're
just defending the whole time. Yeah.

1128
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:53,540
And it's hard to turn
it around. Yeah. Yeah.

1129
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:56,290
Then you can tell like when
you roll against the guy,

1130
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,280
and we talked about this before,

1131
01:06:57,281 --> 01:07:00,430
when you roll against the guy and
even if he's not like his game isn't

1132
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:04,360
aggressive,
but right when you lock up with them,

1133
01:07:04,361 --> 01:07:07,960
you can tell he's like just in the
correct position. You're like, Dang,

1134
01:07:07,961 --> 01:07:10,780
I can't get like a good like,
and when you you're like, okay,

1135
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:11,950
I'm going to get in my position.

1136
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:16,300
And he just adjust like immediately you're
in trouble. Yeah. You're like, Oh Dang.

1137
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,380
That's in a way,

1138
01:07:17,381 --> 01:07:20,770
even though that might be like kind of
like a passive game sometimes it's like

1139
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,870
just his game being put on you.

1140
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:27,550
Position-Wise in this case is that default
decree as opposed to like, you know,

1141
01:07:27,551 --> 01:07:30,400
like you know sometimes like in training
you're training with me and he'd be

1142
01:07:30,401 --> 01:07:32,680
like, okay, I'm going to, it's
essentially letting someone get in an,

1143
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:36,960
into a good position on you. So you're
training your defense or whatever.

1144
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,630
That's different. That's like,
that's not default aggressive there.

1145
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:43,750
You're talking about.
I'm really good from the half guard,

1146
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,220
so I let you get past my full guard to
the half guard and now you're in my world.

1147
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:52,570
Like something like that.
Yeah, that would be, I guess,

1148
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:55,210
would that be the default?
It's like stilts.

1149
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:00,450
Stilts has this weird game because he's
tall and lanky and and flexible and so

1150
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:06,451
he does things like he'll stick his foot
in a place where any normal situation

1151
01:08:06,490 --> 01:08:09,880
in Jujitsu you'd grab his foot
all day long. Yeah. That's
what he wants you to do.

1152
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,860
Yeah.
And I was just telling him the other day,

1153
01:08:11,861 --> 01:08:13,480
I said to all these little
things that you want me to do,

1154
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:16,070
I'm not doing any of them.
Yeah. Pretty Great. And if you

1155
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,880
just stopped doing them and so we eat,

1156
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:21,650
the way he imposes his will
is by giving up these bait.

1157
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,570
He just throws bait out there all day
long and he wants you to get you into

1158
01:08:24,571 --> 01:08:28,220
these positions that he's good at.
Yeah. And so you can't take the bait,

1159
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:31,130
you can't take the bait.
And sometimes the bait is ripe looking.

1160
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:34,940
It's like ripe for the harvest.
And it's everywhere and it's everywhere.

1161
01:08:35,210 --> 01:08:38,060
And so you got to just say, no, I'm
going to stick to the game plan here.

1162
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,770
I'm going to impose my will, which is,
I'm not going to grab the bait. Yeah,

1163
01:08:40,771 --> 01:08:42,800
and that's so crazy because like I said,

1164
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:46,100
kind of philosophically that is the
default aggressive thing when all you're

1165
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:49,580
throwing out is absolutely.
So instead of imposing my game,

1166
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,420
I'm like kind of lured by this bait.
Even if you know the bait is there,

1167
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,820
you're on your heels because
you're watching out for the track.

1168
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,650
Well this is just to kind of,

1169
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:02,090
I think down in the same vein that
you're talking about. I talk about,

1170
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:05,990
I talk about safety, like I'll talk
to companies about safety, you know,

1171
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:07,910
industrial companies or
construction companies,

1172
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,030
manufacturing companies that have,
you know,

1173
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:12,650
can have people get killed
if they're not careful.

1174
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:17,390
And so I talk about being
aggressive and you know, it's okay,

1175
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:22,010
well then Jocko, how does default
aggressive going to keep us safe?

1176
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,770
Because if I've got guys that are out
in the construction site being super

1177
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:27,260
aggressive all day, guess what? They're
going to take risks that they shouldn't.

1178
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:29,840
And I said absolutely wrong because
guess what you're going to get aggressive

1179
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:33,770
with. You're going to aggressively
implement your safety procedures.

1180
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:36,470
You're going to aggressively
like, Hey, you know what?

1181
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,610
I see a guy walking around the job site
without a helmet. We're all over him. Hey,

1182
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:43,010
Jack Ass, put your helmet on.
Get over here. I'm writing you.

1183
01:09:43,011 --> 01:09:46,210
I'm to whatever you're going
to do. Right, right. Oh,

1184
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,690
I see a guy without a seatbelt.
Hey,

1185
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,710
you're not allowed to be on the site
without a, without a seat belt on.

1186
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,200
Get over here. You got to, you
know, we're docking your pay.

1187
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:58,460
You're going to get aggressive in the
implementation of your safety procedures

1188
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:03,400
and yes, that will make you safer.
Yeah. So it's, yeah, I guess, um,

1189
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:06,820
when you hear the word
aggressive, oh, automatically.

1190
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:09,770
I'll give you another example.
I'll give you another physical example.

1191
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:14,240
Another physical example is, okay,
we're in a defensive perimeter.

1192
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:18,140
I don't have enough men to move,
or I've got wounded guys.

1193
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,620
I am going to aggressively
set security, right? Right.

1194
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:24,260
I'm going to put a big
machine gun over here.

1195
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:27,620
I'm going to get that high ground over
there so you can do things aggressively,

1196
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:32,450
even though by their nature they might
not seem aggressive at first. Yeah.

1197
01:10:32,451 --> 01:10:35,790
I think that's what you're trying to
say. Yeah. Yeah, fully. So it's, it, it,

1198
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:37,250
it's almost like it's deeper.

1199
01:10:37,251 --> 01:10:42,070
It's deeper than just like physically
just jumping in. It's more like the,

1200
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:44,510
the idea of whatever's going on.
Here's another one.

1201
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,580
I am going to aggressively,

1202
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:51,973
okay,

1203
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:53,050
ignore.
You know,

1204
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:57,880
I'm going to aggressively
counsel you and mentor you.

1205
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:02,020
Now, the worst thing I could do is
go echo. You better. Listen to me.

1206
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,860
That's the worst thing I could do.
But to be aggressive in doing that,

1207
01:11:06,190 --> 01:11:10,090
what am I going to do? I'm going to set
really good goals. I'm going to flank you.

1208
01:11:10,091 --> 01:11:12,670
I'm going to get into your mind.
I'm doing, I'm being aggressive,

1209
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:16,350
but not an external aggression is an
internal question that only I know is

1210
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:16,980
happening.

1211
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:20,040
You're going to know what's happening in
a year when you've all sudden improved

1212
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:22,710
and you've been successful
and you go, Dang, man.

1213
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,180
Jack was really helped
me out with some stuff.

1214
01:11:24,210 --> 01:11:26,000
I didn't really realize that
was going on, but he did. Yeah.

1215
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,630
I was aggressively doing it.

1216
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:31,560
But you would have never
called it aggressive from
an external viewpoint. Yeah,

1217
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:36,240
so it's as opposed to, let's say like
some sort of a laid back approach. Right?

1218
01:11:36,241 --> 01:11:38,910
Like if, if you have a laid
back approach to security,

1219
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:43,140
if you have a laid back
approach to mentorship or
laid back approach to safety.

1220
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,910
Yes.
None of those things are good.

1221
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:48,430
That's why we have a default aggressive
attitude about things. There you go.

1222
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:52,770
We clarified it after it.
I Dunno though.

1223
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,050
One could say that.
Back to the question.

1224
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,560
One could say that having a
laid back attitude in Jujitsu,

1225
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:03,600
then again on the street, that'd be
less likely to have a laid back. Yeah.

1226
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,480
Did you just in the street, there's
exceptions everywhere I would think,

1227
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:11,640
but let's see. You know, if it's going
down, it's going down default aggressive,

1228
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:15,990
but aggressive in the street. Yeah.
Right now. Yeah. Once it goes,

1229
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:21,030
once it happens. Once the
decision has been made, yeah,
get after it, it's go time.

1230
01:12:21,031 --> 01:12:23,850
It's not good to avoid it as long
as you can avoid as long as you can,

1231
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:29,270
but when you got to go,
go hard go. God Dang.

1232
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,260
I think we're at our last question,
my friend.

1233
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:36,960
Cool.
Jocko,

1234
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,230
does complacency come with age?

1235
01:12:41,710 --> 01:12:44,200
I see a lot of guys that
back off as they get older.

1236
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:47,590
Do you have the urge to back off?

1237
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:53,460
Does is a complacency come with age
and do I have the urge to back off?

1238
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:01,080
Negative. Negative. Back off.

1239
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:05,940
Not Happening.
I hear that.

1240
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,140
I'm over 40. I'm pushing 50, whatever.

1241
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:16,220
Bring it back off.
Negative not happening.

1242
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:19,250
In fact,
I'm stepping it up.

1243
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:24,260
Um, training harder. Eating cleaner.

1244
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:26,380
Okay.

1245
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,640
I'm training more.

1246
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:32,880
I'm learning and reading and studying
more now than I ever have in my whole

1247
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:38,180
life. Do I get dinged up? Of course I do.

1248
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:39,760
Yeah.

1249
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,410
They're,
it takes them some injuries.

1250
01:13:41,670 --> 01:13:46,140
Yeah.
You know what?

1251
01:13:46,141 --> 01:13:50,550
No factor. No factor. Deal with them.

1252
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,210
But you do you know what?

1253
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:58,890
You know what I hear?
I hear the clock ticking.

1254
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:00,930
That's what I hear.

1255
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:05,580
And the end is nigh and
time waits for no man.

1256
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:08,080
Okay.

1257
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,850
And you young guns out
there, 18 old, 20 years old,

1258
01:14:12,851 --> 01:14:14,830
24 years old.
Listen,

1259
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:23,690
life goes by and it goes by quick.

1260
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,990
Don't waste those years.
Don't waste them. Live them.

1261
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:35,470
Now I know
I,

1262
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:41,350
I know that you don't think you're going
to live to be 30 much less 40 but you

1263
01:14:41,571 --> 01:14:43,040
are and you will.

1264
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:45,430
Okay.

1265
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,930
In the earlier you get in
the game and get on track,

1266
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:55,030
the better life you're going
to have. Healthier, wealthier,

1267
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,670
stronger, smarter, better,

1268
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:01,583
better.

1269
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:04,980
Eight.

1270
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:09,980
If you're an old man like me and
you haven't gotten on track yet,

1271
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:14,770
get on track. Get on it. Now

1272
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,580
everyone,
everyone listening to this,

1273
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:23,060
okay,

1274
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,160
here's the deal.
No complacency.

1275
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:26,700
Yeah,

1276
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:29,970
no complacency,
no backing off,

1277
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,490
no slack whatsoever.
Fight,

1278
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:44,960
fight that ticking clock
with everything you got.

1279
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:48,200
So like the end of a hard day,

1280
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,880
you can put your head down with ease,

1281
01:15:55,690 --> 01:16:00,330
satisfied
that you've given your best.

1282
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,013
Okay,

1283
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:09,950
and I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1284
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,310
Now Echo,

1285
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:18,490
if anyone wants to get in the
game as far as this podcast goes,

1286
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,290
what's the best way for them to do that?

1287
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:26,720
Well as far as this podcast
goes and as far as they go.

1288
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,410
Hmm.
I don't know if I'd call it help.

1289
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:35,470
I'd call it supplemental additions to
your life supplements on it.com/jocko you

1290
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:43,310
get 10% off
for real supplements.

1291
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:47,360
Then I said this before,
but I think we should say it again.

1292
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:50,870
That sometimes when you buy something
tells me you're Gunna say, yeah,

1293
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:52,320
I'm going to say it again cause I don't,

1294
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:56,420
I don't think you're going to talk
about chalk. Yeah, I'm good. I'm okay.

1295
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,240
Cause sometimes I don't
know how it is now.

1296
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,730
I've been out of the
supplement game for a while.

1297
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,410
It's as far as taking protein powders
as far as the bad supplements.

1298
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:10,040
Yeah. Or just, we'll just say the general

1299
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,930
mix of supplements,
you know,

1300
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,780
power gainer 5,000 or whatever recovery,
uh,

1301
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:21,890
you know, x, y, Z, whatever. Sometimes
it can just be nonsense in there,

1302
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:27,760
but on it, you know, going in, I
think we all know that it's the,

1303
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:28,940
it's the legit one.

1304
01:17:30,690 --> 01:17:32,820
The only legit one that
I know of for sure.

1305
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:37,260
The one that I know guaranteed is legit.
Put it that way, that I do anyway. Um,

1306
01:17:37,290 --> 01:17:40,470
I would recommend Krill oil.

1307
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:44,330
100% Krill oils. Real. Yeah.

1308
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,250
It's for your joints.
I take

1309
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,520
three 500 milligram Krill oil in
the morning at three in the evening.

1310
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:59,840
All Dang six. Yes. Dang.
Okay. What I do, I take a day.

1311
01:18:00,680 --> 01:18:02,540
Okay,
that's fine.

1312
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:07,250
My daughter list them up to the sun and
she thinks it's like a red jelly bean.

1313
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:12,040
Oh, it doesn't taste like or don't eat
it. Don't chew it and swallow. Yes.

1314
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:15,440
Little things. Anyway, that's a Krill
oil. Uh, though the warrior bars,

1315
01:18:15,441 --> 01:18:17,330
that's a big deal I think.

1316
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:20,120
Oh,
is there like a,

1317
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:26,520
they're the opposite of a donut in
every way except for taste. Yeah.

1318
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:29,010
The gluten free too, by the
way. Yeah. They teach well.

1319
01:18:29,011 --> 01:18:31,950
They taste different than a donut,
but just as good, if not better,

1320
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:36,120
my opinion better. Eight,
three of them all at once.

1321
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,560
I just called it a meal. My meal.
Do you stack reading individually?

1322
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,460
Individually, but anyway. Um,

1323
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:49,200
and also shroom tech soap. A lot of people
eat, you know how people, they'll say,

1324
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:52,020
hey, a lot of people been asking
me when, you know, like Bro,

1325
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,930
a lot of people haven't been asking me,
you're just making,

1326
01:18:54,931 --> 01:18:58,830
like a lot of people are asking. I'm not
saying anyone that says that does that,

1327
01:18:58,831 --> 01:19:01,170
but I'm just saying sometimes
you think butter's for real.

1328
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,820
A lot of people have been asking me
is shroom tech real issue in tech row.

1329
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:09,900
I hear good things. All this stuff. Okay.
Shroom tech, Israel, shroom tech sport.

1330
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:15,270
I haven't tried shroom tech immune
be, I haven't tried it either. Yeah,

1331
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:19,740
because I'm more in the sport mode. Right,
right. It usually sport not sick. Oh,

1332
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:23,820
oh. But you can just have it because you
just want your general immunity to be

1333
01:19:23,821 --> 01:19:28,230
solid. That's like a good
solid thing. Nonetheless.

1334
01:19:28,231 --> 01:19:31,590
Shroom tech sport is real and
I made this analogy again.

1335
01:19:31,591 --> 01:19:34,980
I think it's worth saying again or before.
So again,

1336
01:19:34,981 --> 01:19:37,800
I think you're going to say
it again regardless if we
think it's worth it or not.

1337
01:19:37,801 --> 01:19:40,140
Yes. So let's just so like, okay,

1338
01:19:40,141 --> 01:19:42,990
this is how it works in Layman's terms.

1339
01:19:43,950 --> 01:19:47,160
You know when you're driving
a car and it's about to read,

1340
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:51,540
little needle's going to go into red.
You'd like revving at 100 rpm spoon,

1341
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,940
boom, you're going to be in the
green. I'm going to get to the yellow.

1342
01:19:56,941 --> 01:20:00,510
Even the orange, when you get,
when you hit the red, you can't,

1343
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,840
you can't pull the head.
Can't pull ahead if you're in the red,

1344
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:07,670
so what the shroom tech does? He take
the shroom tech, boom, you're going,

1345
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,513
you're in the green.

1346
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,790
You're going to hit the yellow little
bit a little bit later than normal.

1347
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:14,860
You're going to hit the
orange maybe and you,

1348
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,980
the shroom tech is just going
to keep you in the orange,

1349
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:19,680
going to keep the needle in the orange,
maybe even in the yellow,

1350
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:24,450
and you're going to notice that,
okay? That's how it works. Anyway,

1351
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:29,460
get 10% offers to go on [inaudible]
dot com slash Jocko there you go.

1352
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:34,410
Boom. Support Yourself. Support
your wallet, support the
Podcast, you Baja. Good way.

1353
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:38,280
Also, if you shop at
Amazon, which we all do,

1354
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:40,350
okay.

1355
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,780
Christmas has probably gone at this point,

1356
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:45,960
but we still need normal stuff.

1357
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:50,220
Duct tape,
what

1358
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,820
pens? Pins, cables,

1359
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:59,580
right from your TV or whatever. Anyway,
when you, before you shop on Amazon a,

1360
01:20:59,581 --> 01:21:04,380
you click through our website, which is
Jocko, podcast.com on the side there.

1361
01:21:04,381 --> 01:21:07,380
There's a little Amazon banner. You
Click there, boom. Do your shopping.

1362
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:08,850
You can support that way.

1363
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,670
I use the analogy of the little sodium
piece that when you throw it in the water,

1364
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:19,690
it makes this big explosion
situation. That's kind of the, the,

1365
01:21:19,691 --> 01:21:22,950
the comparison as far as supporting this
podcast because when you click through

1366
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:27,540
the Amazon banner, it's like
such a small thing. It's so easy.

1367
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:30,540
It doesn't cost you nothing, but then
the support that it brings is like a lot,

1368
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:35,680
you know? Yeah. I'm telling you,
we're good. We appreciate, yes.

1369
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:40,340
Small gesture of,
of support to the podcast.

1370
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,530
The small gesture goes a long way.

1371
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:47,150
When you team it up with
a bunch of other people,

1372
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:50,750
the death of a thousand cuts
will kill someone, you know.

1373
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:55,870
But the life of a thousand clicks is
what we're do just to just the small

1374
01:21:56,721 --> 01:22:01,721
cliques is echos looking at
me like I said something bad.

1375
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:06,890
No, no. Good. Oh, it is the
life of a thousand clicks.
The life of a thousand clicks.

1376
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:09,810
Yeah. Click on that
thing. Just, yeah. Yep.

1377
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,620
You're going to get some duct tape
might not seem like a big deal,

1378
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:15,260
but if a bunch of people, we've got
duct tape and they all click through,

1379
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,300
maybe it turns into a big deal.
Yeah.

1380
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:22,220
Then we don't have to put advertisements
on here. Yeah. Which we don't want to do.

1381
01:22:22,990 --> 01:22:27,710
Yeah. Or we could, maybe we will. Jack
would be reading it. I don't think so.

1382
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:28,310
Yeah.

1383
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,300
I don't think it's happening because we
got support from speaking to duck tails.

1384
01:22:32,570 --> 01:22:37,490
Um, remember the Penn state duct
tape? Yeah, sure. Sarah. Two blades.

1385
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,770
Yeah. Sorry. I need some more tough team.

1386
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:46,340
Um, anyway. Yeah. Back to the Ama.
Amazon. Yeah. So go to the website,

1387
01:22:46,341 --> 01:22:48,050
click through the Amazon
before you do the shopping.

1388
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:51,230
That's a good way to support.
Good way. Thank you guys for that.

1389
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:54,800
I'm also subscribed to
the podcast on iTunes

1390
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:59,570
or on Google play or on stitcher.
You're on.

1391
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:05,450
What's the other ones? Those are the
big ones. Yeah. Other stuff. Yeah.

1392
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,280
What other

1393
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:11,110
things you might need? You know, whichever
one it's on, man. Um, that seems obvious,

1394
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:14,260
but that's a cool way to support. And
then the youtube as well. You know,

1395
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:18,220
we'll put some excerpts on there. More
excerpts. That's the right word, right?

1396
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:19,750
Excerpts.
Yeah.

1397
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:23,230
A little bite size nuggets.

1398
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:27,970
Jocko wisdom that if you
are inclined to share,

1399
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,620
you can share and kind of be ensured that
there the likelihood of them listening

1400
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:37,500
to the whole thing is higher than if you
just share that. So the podcast. Yeah.

1401
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,650
Because if you're like, Hey,
uh, you know, here's the,

1402
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,460
here's the good way to approach college
and you want to share this with your

1403
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:48,910
friend because they got a son that's
going to college or you're sharing it with

1404
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:50,050
the frank because
they're going to college,

1405
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:55,930
they're going to listen to that way more
likely then listening to two hours of

1406
01:23:55,931 --> 01:23:58,930
that episode. There's a long time. Yeah.

1407
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:02,590
Cause maybe they're going to
college like that day or something.

1408
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:06,730
You know what I mean? Or they could just
listen to it while they're in college,

1409
01:24:06,731 --> 01:24:11,680
whichever, but anyway, they're just
more consumable we'd say. Yes. Yeah.

1410
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:16,160
Bite size, bite size, like a
mcnugget Jocko McKnight's. Yep.

1411
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:20,880
Exactly. So anyway, the point there
is youtube, that's a cool way to,

1412
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:25,330
to support and whatnot. Um,
anyway, the, and there's a store,

1413
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:26,380
Jocko has a store,

1414
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:31,790
it's called Jocko store and there's
tee shirts and whatnot on there.

1415
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:36,220
They're, they're cool
shirts, I think. So I don't,

1416
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,650
I'm not like one of those
people where they're like,

1417
01:24:38,651 --> 01:24:42,910
they're cool tee shirts because that's a
subjective thing. So I would encourage,

1418
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:43,803
invite

1419
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:49,480
people to go to Jocko store.com
look at the t shirt. That's it.

1420
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:53,740
That's all. That's all. Look at
them. If you want to buy one,

1421
01:24:53,741 --> 01:24:56,710
if you notice the layers,
if the layers resonate,

1422
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,700
I thought you gave up on the layers.
Now you're back in the day.

1423
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,390
We're still doing layers.
Yeah, we're still doing it.

1424
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:06,670
If they resonate with you and
you're compelled to get a shirt,

1425
01:25:06,671 --> 01:25:11,470
support the podcast. Represent the
layers in your part of the world.

1426
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,530
If you're a cadet at west point,

1427
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:19,570
if you're a guy with a truck
with a bumper sticker on it,

1428
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,300
no matter who you are, if you choose to
want to represent, do all that, get it.

1429
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:29,980
Get a shirt, get a sticker, get
a patch, a Hoodie, a Hoodie,

1430
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,960
get a rash guard. If you're, you know,

1431
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:36,310
if you don't have a rash guard and you're
doing Jujitsu or cycling or running,

1432
01:25:36,311 --> 01:25:38,860
crossfit,
anything with like a lot of activity,

1433
01:25:39,790 --> 01:25:43,270
get a rash guard if you haven't
already, if you want. Anyway,

1434
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,860
there is also psychological warfare.

1435
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:52,710
We went through really the, the, the
what? The beginnings or the [inaudible],

1436
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:57,610
not the purpose, what do you
call it? The to formation.

1437
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,060
The formation, the story, the
story behind it. Last time.

1438
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:06,170
Basically it's Jockos version of
those days where you kind of got it.

1439
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:10,610
This is my words in my own words.
Jockos version of the, you know,

1440
01:26:10,611 --> 01:26:14,870
those days where you got to talk yourself
into doing the workout or not eating,

1441
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,840
you know,
a whole thing of Oreos or whatever.

1442
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:22,940
And you got to talk yourself into
Oreo. Yeah. Not the whole thing.

1443
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:26,690
Yeah. The moments of weakness. Yeah.

1444
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:31,100
When you got to talk yourself into it or
out of something, you know, like Amen.

1445
01:26:31,130 --> 01:26:34,850
Hey, do you have to do this?
Workout? Doesn't sound like that,

1446
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:38,420
but that's essentially, you know
what it is anyways. Jockos Virgin,

1447
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:42,590
you go on Itunes,
you purchase either a track nine,

1448
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:46,340
9 cents or the album like nine
bucks, I think. Something like that.

1449
01:26:46,341 --> 01:26:48,830
I think it's actually nine 99.
Yeah.

1450
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:51,680
And there's a wake up one
you can put on your, um,

1451
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:54,050
your alarm clock on your
phone to wake you up,

1452
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:58,310
clear it with your wife or whoever
you sleep with. Go over it,

1453
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:01,220
go over the whole plan, like a drill,
like Kinda like a fire drill. Really.

1454
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:05,780
Because I'm telling you if the few here
that even if you forgot that you put it

1455
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:08,390
on your phone and you hear that Bro,

1456
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:14,930
I'm going to have some explaining to do
the feedback has been really good. Yeah.

1457
01:27:15,650 --> 01:27:17,840
People that have had trouble waking up,

1458
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,100
they don't have trouble waking
up in the morning. You know,

1459
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:23,330
people that have trouble when they,
when it's snack time,

1460
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,620
people that have trouble that they can't,
they can't say no to the donut.

1461
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:28,850
You get it,
get this,

1462
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:33,080
get the psychological warfare
attack going on against the donuts.

1463
01:27:33,230 --> 01:27:36,870
The psychological warfare will
win. Yes. Every single time. Yup.

1464
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,660
And if you're having a hard time,

1465
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:44,000
if you're having a hard time figuring
out which day is workout day in rest day,

1466
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:47,900
you know when you, you're tricking help
configure that out. Yes, exactly right.

1467
01:27:48,020 --> 01:27:52,660
Exactly right. Yes. That's a
good, good point. Rest Day.

1468
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:53,810
It isn't today.
Yeah.

1469
01:27:53,830 --> 01:27:57,830
The way if you're in or
if you're switching your
workout day to the rest day,

1470
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:01,880
like if you're doing those, which I used
to do, this will help that for sure.

1471
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:06,690
All I can all say that right now in
public with 100% certainty that at that

1472
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,860
it'll solve that problem.
Sweet.

1473
01:28:10,250 --> 01:28:14,300
Also Jocko white tea,
it is available.

1474
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:15,853
It's in stock.

1475
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:22,080
It will 100% increase your dead lift

1476
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:26,210
by 500%.

1477
01:28:29,250 --> 01:28:31,520
Uh, no Jocko White Tea, pomegranate,

1478
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:34,420
they will make you dead
lift a lot more weights. Um,

1479
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:38,570
and that is 100% proven
in all scientific manners.

1480
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,470
No, just kidding. It tastes good
and it will make you better.

1481
01:28:43,370 --> 01:28:47,390
You can drink it from a get after it Mug
AMUG that will tell you exactly what to

1482
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:49,880
do in the morning and
that is get after it.

1483
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,960
And if you like what we talked about
on the podcast while you're on Amazon,

1484
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:59,270
after you clicked through
the Jocko podcast website,

1485
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:02,040
then you get there and you can pick
up a copy of a book called extreme

1486
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,940
ownership. You might like it if
you liked the podcast. Talk about,

1487
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,500
talk about leadership and talk about war.

1488
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:15,960
Two of my favorite things also,
once again,

1489
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:21,050
extreme ownership muster zero zero to
May 4th and fifth at the Marriott Marquis

1490
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:24,600
in New York City. Come
to it. You will dig it.

1491
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:28,230
The first one we had, people had
no idea what we were going to do.

1492
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,990
They had no idea. We didn't even
put up a barely put up an agenda.

1493
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:35,610
People came anyways, we
delivered, we had an awesome time.

1494
01:29:35,970 --> 01:29:40,200
The testimonials are cool.
So you can know what you took,

1495
01:29:40,201 --> 01:29:43,500
you can look forward this time Warner,
it's not so such a mystery.

1496
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:45,690
You can know what you're
going to get out of.

1497
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:50,691
It echoes making some videos question
well is that you're talking about the

1498
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:55,710
schedule like this one you'll have like
a schedule, we'll have a little bit more,

1499
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,030
but just people didn't,

1500
01:29:57,031 --> 01:30:01,440
people just wondered what we were going
to be doing there. Right. And you know we,

1501
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:04,380
they kind of just took it in faith that
we're going to have that they knew one

1502
01:30:04,381 --> 01:30:06,990
thing that we were going to do there
and that was get after it and we did.

1503
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,190
And so you know we're going
to do it again. Like I said,

1504
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:15,690
I think I said this last time echoes
making videos in once the video has come

1505
01:30:15,691 --> 01:30:17,910
out and kind of show what's going on,

1506
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:22,320
it's gonna sell out it cause the footage
from the first one is awesome and it's

1507
01:30:22,321 --> 01:30:25,890
going to sell out quickly. So get in,

1508

01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:41,310
on Twitter and on Instagram.

1527
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,890
And if you're going to be inside,

1528
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:48,570
that's Facebook [inaudible] you going
to be there with you, my friend.

1529
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:54,290
So Echo is at Echo Charles
and I am at Jocko Willink.

1530
01:31:57,631 --> 01:32:02,631
And finally thank you for
all the questions and the
feedback and the downloads

1531
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:08,260
and the support to the military personnel.

1532
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:13,030
Stay on your game and be
aggressive to the vets.

1533
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:17,110
Thank you for your service to
the police and firefighters.

1534
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:22,000
Thank you guys and girls for
keeping us safe on the home front.

1535
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,310
Yeah.

1536
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:28,720
End of the rest of you.
Fighters, grinders,

1537
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:33,550
troopers, leaders. Keep pushing,

1538
01:32:35,020 --> 01:32:36,010
keep grinding,

1539
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:41,680
let there be no complacency
and let there be no slack.

1540
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:46,340
Let their only be

1541
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:53,320
getting after it.
So until next time,

1542
01:32:54,010 --> 01:32:57,940
this is echo and Jocko
out.
