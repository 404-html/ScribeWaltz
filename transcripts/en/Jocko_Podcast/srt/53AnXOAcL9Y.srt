1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,840
This is Jocko podcast number
six with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,753
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,680
Time to get back to the books.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Last time I read some letters and
today we're going back to the books and

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,220
actually this one is kind of hard for
us or it's a stretch to call this a book

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,620
today we're, I've given
some pretty, um, you know,

7
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:36,621
the last hundred yards is a very
rare piece of piece of literature,

8
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:41,460
if you could even call it that.
Uh, same with battle leadership.

9
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,290
That's pretty rare now that will be fun.

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,080
And found on the Internet about
face was a pretty popular book. Uh,

11
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,150
but this one tonight we're going with
something that many people have heard of

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,260
or at a minimum you've heard
of Napoleon, right? Sure.

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,143
Terry leader.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,190
But what's interesting about this and
what's almost makes it cheating from my

15
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:08,160
perspective for me is
that these are maxims.

16
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:13,140
These are already parsed down and
put into a format that's very easy to

17
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:17,890
understand. You know, he, the work
has already been done. Uh, and,

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,720
and I'll tell you,

19
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,720
it is hard for me to find books or
pieces of information to do this with.

20
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,590
And a part of the reason is it takes a,

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,740
it takes, I'm looking for
something very specific, right?

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,530
And it's not, you know,
there's, so there's a lot of,

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,560
there's tons of great books about war
and they are about war there about what

24
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:50,220
happened and how the war happened and how,
what,

25
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
what tactics were used and at what unit
moved where and how many people they

26
00:01:55,711 --> 00:02:00,570
killed and how many maneuvers they did.
And so that's very interesting.

27
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:03,130
And there's definitely lessons
to be learned from that in there.

28
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,750
There is knowledge and that
there's knowledge inside of tactics

29
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,610
and you'll have the most common one
is like if you talk about the flank,

30
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,660
which is the most common
tactic is you know, if, if,

31
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,460
if you're assaulting a target,
you go straight on and that's,

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,560
that's a frontal assault.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,130
But then what you want to do is you want
to swing around the outside and hit him

34
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,630
from where they're not
protecting themselves.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,570
So that's a tactic that
can be applied to anything.

36
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:34,480
It can be applied to a debate,
it can be applied to Jujitsu,

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,650
it can be proud to business situations
where you know you want to hit your

38
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,080
competition where they aren't expecting
it. So that's a flank. So you,

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,320
so there is knowledge to be
gained from tactics for sure.

40
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,190
But what I am always more interested
in is the leadership and the the human

41
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:55,080
psychology,
you know,

42
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:58,770
and that's why I love battle battle
leadership because that first chapters,

43
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,680
battlefield psychology,
um,

44
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,880
and this is pre, you know, this
is world war one. You know,

45
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:11,590
there was no kind of Fufu new age,

46
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,950
hey feelings and what are, people
know the, all that stuff didn't exist.

47
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,180
And here's this guy talking about
battlefield psychology and, but,

48
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:22,660
but that's what I'm always interested in.
That's what I want to explore.

49
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,950
That's what I want to learn about.

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,390
That's what I want to compare
my experiences too because,

51
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,460
and I've said this before,

52
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:34,690
leadership is the most
challenging of all endeavors.

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:35,681
And,

54
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,681
and leading these human beings with all
these variables is the most challenging

55
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,720
and therefore the most rewarding.

56
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:48,810
So while the tactics are important
and you and you can gain from them,

57
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:53,650
it's, it's how the people react,
what they do, where they go.

58
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,100
Those are the things that,
that stand the test of time.

59
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:00,090
And that's always what I'm looking for.
Um,

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,900
so these kind of things

61
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,870
are that are the things that allow you
as a leader of other people to look at

62
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:15,040
those examples and learn
from them and gain from them.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:20,250
And there will be little changes and
little adjustments and you can see that

64
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:25,660
there's changes over time.
But the basic principles,

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,530
no matter when you, you can always
learn from them, you know? And,

66
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,490
and it's the same thing with the tactics.
Like for instance, there was, you know,

67
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,180
when we were fighting in Iraq and
Afghanistan then I did not fight in

68
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,014
Afghanistan,

69
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,940
but one of my good buddies
that fought with me in Iraq,

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,250
and you know,

71
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,430
we brought back a lot of tactics and
learned a lot of lessons and he said after

72
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:51,940
he went to Afghanistan and he said, that's
the same thing. And people would say,

73
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,450
it's not that, it's totally,
it's a totally different war.

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,960
And He, so he fought in
both and he says, yeah,

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,560
I'm in Iraq where we weren't Ramada.

76
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:07,561
He goes in Ramadi and in Iraq it's
streets and buildings and you know,

77
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:11,320
you get the elevated positions on the
buildings and then you've got control over

78
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:16,000
the streets and he goes in
and Afghanistan, it's valleys
and hills and you know,

79
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,360
your kid, the elevated position on the
hills and, and it's pretty much the,

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,930
you know, the same thing. Are there
differences? Absolutely. You know,

81
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,780
but I'm saying the basic principles that
he learned, he was able to apply. Um,

82
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,960
and again,

83
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,520
not that I don't always keep an open
mind that things can change and things

84
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,500
unexpected things will happen,
but that's sort of where,

85
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,480
you know what I'm always looking for.

86
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:45,481
So that's why there's a lot of war
books that I love to read and read,

87
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,570
but I don't take away the same types of
lessons that I want to talk to people

88
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,890
about or that I think people want to talk
to about. It'd be a different program.

89
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,740
It would be a different program and
maybe we should do a program that's,

90
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,020
that's aimed at,
you know,

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,590
military people that are,

92
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,650
that are concerned about tactics because
that is definitely something that I,

93
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,490
that I kind of worship that kicks you.
I love tactics.

94
00:06:13,491 --> 00:06:16,790
I love talking about tactics. Um, but,

95
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,680
but further for normal people and,
and for military leaders,

96
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,740
learning about how people react is to
me kind of what's important and what I

97
00:06:29,961 --> 00:06:32,300
like to explore. Right? Man.

98
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,090
So interesting on a couple of things
about Napoleon. Everyone, everyone knows,

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,160
you know,
something about Napoleon,

100
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,740
a couple of cool facts about them. And
this is going into this book here, which,

101
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,340
which the book is actually called roots
of strategy and it's got a bunch of

102
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:54,341
different bunch of different sections
to it and it's different leaders,

103
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,530
different historical
leaders throughout time.

104
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,200
And in this section on Napoleon
Napoleon going into the book here,

105
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,400
Napoleon fought more
battles than Alexander,

106
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:07,100
Hannibal and Caesar combined.

107
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,570
He is beyond any doubt the
greatest of European soldiers.

108
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,280
So pretty good lead in, we were talking
about a guy with some knowledge.

109
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,410
He astounded his opponents by the
crushing rapidity of his battles.

110
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:26,890
He marched against the enemy and his
plan of battle was a part of his plan of

111
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,094
March.

112
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,220
So he's a guy that used mobility and used
the quickness in that pace to dictate

113
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,020
how the battles were going to go.

114
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,770
His tactical system or scheme of battle
was based on a holding attack against

115
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,990
the enemy's front to keep them occupied.

116
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,820
A wide envelopment or turning movement
on the enemy's rear with a small force to

117
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:54,821
spread this main confusion
in the defenders ranks and
then the decisive blow.

118
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,240
So that's what we just talked about and
he was sort of a master of the flank,

119
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,180
Hey, I'm going to do a good
assault. You're going to be
paying attention to that.

120
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,290
And then from the side or the rear or
somewhere that you're not expecting,

121
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,620
you're getting submitted.
And that's what he did.

122
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,260
Napoleon was the first great
strategist of the Western world.

123
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,100
His battles where the result of his
strategical movements and we're careful,

124
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,090
carefully calculated,
very,

125
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,230
I would say that anyone that associate,

126
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:32,231
anyone that thinks of Napoleon thinks
of him as a strategist and a great

127
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,344
strategist.

128
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Now this collection of his maxims was
published in Paris in 1827 and almost

129
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,830
immediately was translated into
German, English, Spanish and Italian.

130
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:51,190
Stonewall Jackson carried these maxims
in his hammer sack throughout his

131
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:55,410
campaign.
This little volume states,

132
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,770
Colonel Henderson,
who is Jackson's biography,

133
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,340
contains a fairly complete
exposition in Napoleon's own, uh,

134
00:09:03,341 --> 00:09:07,920
Napoleon's own words of the
grand principles of war.

135
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,440
And then the person that
actually compiled the maxims.

136
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,180
And this is actually,

137
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,330
this is a statement that is very similar
to what I started off talking about.

138
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:22,771
You know,

139
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:27,771
what I like to learn about the art of
war is susceptible of being considered

140
00:09:29,341 --> 00:09:30,570
under two titles.

141
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,840
The one which rests entirely on the
knowledge and genius of the commander.

142
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,970
The other on matters of detail.
Now hear,

143
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,610
they're going to break that
down a little bit further.

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,260
The first is the same for all time,
for all peoples,

145
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,500
whatever arms with which they fight.

146
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,781
From this,

147
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:56,781
it follows that the same principles
have directed the great captains of all

148
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,320
centuries.
So that's what I like to read about those,

149
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,650
those same principles that have directed
the great captains of all centuries,

150
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,720
those basic principles. And a lot of those
have to do with human nature. And then,

151
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,840
and then it goes on to say that the
matters of detail and what he's talking

152
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:20,670
about matters details he's talking about
tactics on the contrary are subject to

153
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:24,660
the influence of time to the spirit of
the people and the character of armor.

154
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,170
And so, you know, that's when you change
from having bow and arrows to rifles,

155
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:30,630
to machine guns, to bombs,
to whatever. And so there,

156
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:34,320
there are drastic
changes in those tactics.

157
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,860
And that's why while they interest me,

158
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,590
and I always like to find a common
thread in tactics and say, oh,

159
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:45,060
it's the same thing that we do. You
know, that they didn't World War One,

160
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,890
we do that now, or
whatever. You know, you all,

161
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,130
I'm always looking to find that thread,

162
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,230
but it's sometimes it can be hard to find
and sometimes it doesn't exist to any

163
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,220
great degree.

164
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,460
Whereas the way people act and the
way human beings respond to combat

165
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,480
situations,

166
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,370
it doesn't change as much.
Yeah.

167
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:13,371
You would think if you go deep enough
or fundamental enough that it's not

168
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:18,480
surprising that it won't change because
dealing with people in their needs and

169
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,110
like almost on a biological
level psychologically,

170
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,610
a lot of times biologically
preservation of life plays a big part.

171
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,940
So yet technology can advance.
Even social stuff can advance,

172
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:36,700
but that fund, those fundamental
needs typically stay the
same. Him Can you, right.

173
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,770
But if you think about this,
and we talked about this last time,

174
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:40,080
and like with a World War One,

175
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,720
you know these basic needs for survival,
these men,

176
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,000
but just just threw them out the window.

177
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,330
I mean it's just absolutely crazy.

178
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,630
They disregarded that drive and
just went over the top into hell.

179
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,443
An intermission.

180
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,040
Gunfires does that kind of go along the
lines with something that is still here

181
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:07,440
in a big way where they kind of put
their own personal needs, whether they,

182
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,330
you know, their, their, their
need to survive personally,

183
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,420
they put the need for their
mission or their honor to survive.

184
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,400
They put that in front of their
need to survive personally.

185
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,350
[inaudible] that's Kinda,
doesn't that kind of translate even now?

186
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,060
That's how like, yes, yes. I mean
I guess if we say that that's a,

187
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,700
that that's a normal human trait,

188
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,050
which I don't know if it is or not that
I think it's something that gets learned.

189
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,060
I don't think it's a inherent normal,
normal trade. Unless you say, look,

190
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,210
people have an inherent
trait to make their tribe,

191
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,510
their family survived and maybe that's
it. Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

192
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,400
That's exactly what I was going to say.
So military culture, especially when you,

193
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:54,730
when you deal with the elite,
were doing a good job

194
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,550
to put it lightly.
Doing a good job is very important.

195
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,310
You would think that that culture
cultivates that need to put the mission in

196
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:09,550
front of my own personal stuff
still in so deep into that,

197
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:14,550
that individual that it does most
of the time Trump their need. Yeah,

198
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,140
you're right. And that thread
actually, we can go through all,

199
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,180
all of history and find a thread of,

200
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,440
of groups of people that sacrificed
and put there the mission or the,

201
00:13:26,591 --> 00:13:30,760
the group out of themselves, right? Yes,
yes. I mean look at Thermopylae with the,

202
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,800
the 300 Spartans. I mean,
that's our classic example.

203
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,620
And even the fought and
died for their country.

204
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,530
Yeah. And even people who
aren't in the military,

205
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:47,350
we understand that that's how
elite soldiers are. You know,

206
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,760
we understand that. Oh yeah, they,
they, that's an elite soldier.

207
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:54,610
One Who will put his life on the
line for the mission for the country.

208
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,670
That we all understand that.
And you use the term elite,

209
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:02,910
but I will not use the term elite because
I've seen every soldier who wouldn't

210
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:07,660
be considered elite. Right.
I've seen them. All right.

211
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:12,400
Do that marines do that
and US Army soldiers and,

212
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,060
and you know,
the,

213
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,300
the untrained reservists that doesn't
really hasn't been through the kind of

214
00:14:20,921 --> 00:14:23,350
training that we have at all,
but they will have that.

215
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,990
So it has nothing to do really with,

216
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,290
which actually proves your point even
more is that it doesn't even have to do

217
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,260
with your level of training
or your so called being elite.

218
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:35,500
It has to do with your dedication to
the mission and the people that are with

219
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,180
you. So, but yeah,

220
00:14:37,181 --> 00:14:41,230
I guess a better than better than
a better word than elite would be,

221
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,180
I guess just like a dedicated soldier.
Just a soldier in general. Yes.

222
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,010
So back to the book here.
A plan. Okay. Now this is,

223
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,870
now we're getting into the maxims and
I'm not, I obviously didn't do all of it,

224
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:57,360
but I picked out the ones that I
kind of fought, have the most, uh,

225
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,810
talk about human nature.

226
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:03,020
But at the same time also talk
about from a leadership perspective,

227
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,770
planning execution. If they are important
and they are universal, then I, I,

228
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,480
I put them in here.

229
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,480
And this is kind of one of them that
I just talked about with planning.

230
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,860
A plan of campaign should anticipate
everything which the enemy can do and

231
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:17,210
contain within itself.

232
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,390
The means of forwarding him plans of
campaign may be infinitely modified

233
00:15:23,481 --> 00:15:25,220
according to the circumstances.

234
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:30,490
This is exactly what we heard on battle
leadership from von Shell is that,

235
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,090
so he just said, you know, the
plan should anticipate everything.

236
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,230
But then he goes on to say,

237
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,820
plans of campaign may be infinitely
modified according to the circumstances,

238
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,570
the genius of the commander,
the quality of the troops,

239
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,210
and it's apostrophe of the theater of war.

240
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,720
So this is again a common thread
that we hear all the time.

241
00:15:50,721 --> 00:15:53,300
And that is you got to have
adaptability and you've gotta be,

242
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,540
and one of the biggest hindrances to
adaptability is ego is when you saying,

243
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,880
Oh, you know what? My plan is awesome.

244
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,840
My plan is my plan is the best and I'm
just going to ride my plan into the

245
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,841
ground and take everyone down with me
because I don't have the humility to admit

246
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,590
that my plan went wrong.

247
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,830
To admit that the enemy did
something I didn't expect to,

248
00:16:15,831 --> 00:16:20,150
to admit that I have shortfalls with my
troops or whatever the case may be and

249
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:22,400
say, you know what, I need to
adapt. I'm going to do it now.

250
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,593
Next one.

251
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,750
All war should be
systematic for every war,

252
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:38,751
should have an aim and be conducted in
conformity with the principles and rules

253
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:44,030
of the art war should be undertaken with
forces corresponding to the magnitude

254
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,030
of the obstacles that
are to be anticipated.

255
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,730
Now what caught me about that one was
recently I got asked a bunch of questions

256
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,353
about

257
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,710
the situation in Iraq and Syria and one
of the things people want to throw out

258
00:17:02,711 --> 00:17:03,850
there because it's a,

259
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,950
okay,

260
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,880
it's a catchy,

261
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,090
yeah,

262
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:11,350
buzz word or group of
buzzwords and that's, you know,

263
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:14,980
boots on the ground and you know,
I kept getting asked,

264
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:18,580
well how many boots on
the ground do we need?

265
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:21,190
How many troops do we
need to put on the ground?

266
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:23,980
And my answer was the same every time,

267
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,370
which is we put as many troops on the
ground as it takes to win and to win

268
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:33,640
decisively. And without question,
that's how you go to war.

269
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,903
Okay?

270
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:38,701
Now,

271
00:17:38,701 --> 00:17:43,701
this is another little maxim which I
really like at the commencement of a

272
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:47,580
campaign.

273
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,530
The question whether advance or
not requires careful deliberation.

274
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,880
So before you go into war,
you carefully deliberate,

275
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,470
and this is something that
I've been talking about lately.

276
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,860
When people think that
because I'm a soldier,

277
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:09,120
because I'm a warrior,

278
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,880
that I want to go to war and I
want all my friends go to the war,

279
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,430
which is just a ridiculous statement.

280
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,580
If there's anybody that
understands the impact of war,

281
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,420
it's guys that have been to war.

282
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,870
So this careful deliberation before
you commence a campaign is exactly what

283
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:31,350
should be done.
And then it goes on to say,

284
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:36,450
but when you have once
undertaken the offensive,

285
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,990
it should be maintained
to the last extremity,

286
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,170
right? That's commitment.
That is commitment.

287
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,470
Now I will say this even on that,

288
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,180
and that's a beautiful thing you should
maintained to the last extremity.

289
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,350
That's an extreme statement and I would
tell you that you got to balance that

290
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,520
and you want to maintain that. But
what I just said is that, you know,

291
00:19:01,521 --> 00:19:02,630
if your plan isn't working,

292
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,770
you got to put your ego in check and
figuring out a new plan. So yeah,

293
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,810
you want to maintain it
to the last extremity,

294
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,990
but just short of elastics remedy is okay.

295
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,800
Do an ego check and make sure you've
got a good plan going. A retreat,

296
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,040
however skillful the maneuvers may be,

297
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,070
will always produce an injurious
moral effect on the army.

298
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,710
Since by losing chances
of success yourself,

299
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,540
you throw them into
the hands of the enemy.

300
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,350
Besides retreats cost far more both in
men and material than the most of bloody

301
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:41,330
engagements with this
difference that in battle,

302
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,450
the enemy loses nearly much
as you while on a retreat,

303
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,080
the loss is all on your side.
Again,

304
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,100
a common thread that we
talk about with von Schell,

305
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,330
with Hackworth in that is
being on the offensive is good.

306
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,810
Being on the offensive is always
better than being on the defensive.

307
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,880
This is a another. Um, I hope,

308
00:20:11,881 --> 00:20:14,400
I don't know what I'm saying this
for every one of these maxims.

309
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,700
But these are you.
You know,

310
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,960
and it's not surprising that you do say
this before each one of these maximums,

311
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,350
you go, wow, this is an
impactful, and this is an
important, I've heard this before,

312
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:30,330
this is another way of
reinstate or restating the
same topic that we say all the

313
00:20:30,331 --> 00:20:34,410
time. A general should say
to himself many times a day,

314
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,690
if the hostile army were to make is make
its appearance in front on my right or

315
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:41,550
on my left,
what should I do?

316
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,290
Yes.

317
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:48,730
And if he is embarrassed,
his arrangements are bad,

318
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,900
there is something wrong,
he must rectify his mistake.

319
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,190
So this is the humility of
constantly asking yourself, okay,

320
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,420
if I got hit from the flank right now,
what would I do? How would I handle it?

321
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,290
Am I ready for that? If I'm not ready
for it, how do I make that change?

322
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,250
So constantly assessing yourself,
seeing where you're at,

323
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,480
seeing how you're doing.
That's a common thread,

324
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,700
not just for war,

325
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,320
but for being a man and being a
human. Being a woman, being a,

326
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,900
being a person that's
trying to be successful.

327
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,130
Are you looking at looking around
and you know, things are, I'm,

328
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm always most nervous when things are
going well. When things are going well,

329
00:21:29,801 --> 00:21:31,930
I'm always thinking, okay, what wince?

330
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,690
When is the bad thing going to
come and hit me? Right. You know,

331
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,030
how do I prepare for that?
How do I watch out for it?

332
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,460
How do I flank that thing
before it happens to,

333
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:44,380
a lot of times people will get in, they'll
in a way revel in the success. Right.

334
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,690
And they'll get used to it.
It'll be good to them.

335
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:48,040
They'll get used to it and then,
yeah,

336
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,990
when something does go bad
or just different, even a
lot of dining decided, yeah,

337
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,820
they're just still into that
success and immersing themselves in,

338
00:21:56,821 --> 00:22:00,810
in that success then yeah, they
didn't know what to do. I was a wee,

339
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,140
my first deployment to Iraq,

340
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,200
we were doing assaults in capturing bad
guys and we got a guy and then we went

341
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,420
and got another guy. Right.
Right on. Right on top of them.

342
00:22:13,421 --> 00:22:14,800
We interrogated that guy.
We wouldn't go.

343
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,360
We broke down some cell and my
commanding officer at the time,

344
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,800
he came to me, he said,
Hey Jocko, those, you know,

345
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,680
I think it was four missions
in a row within 24 hour period.

346
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,200
And he said, hey, those
operations that, that was awesome,

347
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,300
awesome work,
be able to tell your platoon.

348
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,390
They did a great job getting the
information, going back out there,

349
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:41,170
a quick planning cycle. It
was just fantastic. You know,

350
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:44,830
those are very admirable. And
I just looked at him, I said,

351
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,460
give us 24 hours and we'll screw it up.
And I just,

352
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,340
you don't want to set expectations.
That's how, that's how,

353
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:55,390
that's to avoid what you were talking
about. To avoid. Be like, that's right.

354
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:59,290
You know, I said, no. Hey,
you know what sir? Give us 24
hours and we'll screw it up.

355
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,790
Right. Do you ever fear like in that
were in that particular case that um,

356
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,400
he could look at edit as, Dang,
are you being negative or could,

357
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,650
obviously you're not, given what you're
saying, you're not being negative,

358
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,150
you're checking yourself the whole time.

359
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:16,330
But do you fear that
that either he didn't,

360
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,880
either your commanding officer or
anyone would take that as, Dang,

361
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:21,490
this guy's a pessimist or
something like that? No,

362
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:26,020
I had a great relationship with my, with
all my commanding his officers, you know,

363
00:23:26,021 --> 00:23:28,990
why are we say that's my responsibility
is to have a great relationship with

364
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:29,261
these guys.

365
00:23:29,261 --> 00:23:32,550
And so he knew that I was just being
humble and making sure that we're getting

366
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:35,920
cocky even though he was trying
to fire me up and you know,

367
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:38,410
he's probably be trying to do that
because everyone was kind of burned out.

368
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:39,101
I mean from doing,

369
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:42,580
staying awake for a long period of time
and doing a bunch of hops and he was

370
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:46,240
just trying to, you know, give some
compliments and I just said, hey sir, no,

371
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,750
let's not, let's not get crazy here.
Yeah. Long deployment ahead of us still.

372
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,590
So you gotta be careful of that.

373
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,553
Yeah.

374
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:06,010
To operate upon lines remote from each
other and without communications between

375
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:08,810
them is a fault,

376
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,870
which ordinarily occasions a second the
detached column has orders only for the

377
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,754
first day.

378
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,050
It's operations for the second day may
depend on what has happened to the main

379
00:24:21,051 --> 00:24:24,080
body.
Thus according to circumstances,

380
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,400
the column wastes time and waiting
for orders or an acts randomly.

381
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,980
So what that means is you've got multiple
elements out there and you've got the

382
00:24:34,981 --> 00:24:39,210
main element and whoever breaks
off from that main element,

383
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,170
they might know what to do the first day,
but what do they do the second day?

384
00:24:43,171 --> 00:24:48,171
And this is just going into classic
decentralized command because in reality

385
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,520
today,
in today's world,

386
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,850
this rarely happens where we
lose total communications.

387
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:56,370
And in the business world,
I mean I'm a text away,

388
00:24:56,371 --> 00:25:00,960
you can literally talk to me at
instantaneously. But there there's,

389
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:05,961
there's times in combat and in the
business world and in life where

390
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:09,540
instantaneously isn't fast enough.
You know, eat is not fast enough.

391
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,620
When we talked about this with
decentralized command, if, if you know,

392
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,680
you get ambushed and you don't know what
you're supposed to do as a commander,

393
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:22,830
when you get ambushed, you don't have a
plan, you don't have an overall strategy,

394
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,860
then what are you going to call back
to higher headquarters and saying, Hey,

395
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,690
Jocko were getting ambushed right now.
What do you want me to do? No, I've,

396
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,070
I've you, you gotta be out
there in the field with the,

397
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,990
with the commander's
intent that you know what,

398
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,830
what you're supposed to do and
you know that if you could ambush,

399
00:25:37,831 --> 00:25:39,360
here's what you're going to,
you're going to break contact.

400
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,570
Are you going to flank the enemy
or whatever the case may be.

401
00:25:42,571 --> 00:25:47,370
But you're gonna know what to do in a,
in a business environment,

402
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,061
it's the same thing.

403
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:52,740
There's times where instant
communication isn't fast enough.

404
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,700
You know, I actually see this when we
work with like sales people and you know,

405
00:25:56,701 --> 00:25:59,850
there'll be some hierarchy of,

406
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,470
of adjusting product pricing and you know,

407
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:09,000
a client will come in or a customer
will come in and if that person,

408
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:14,001
if that frontline salesperson doesn't
have the ability to make up a pricing

409
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:18,480
decision on the spot. And so, you know
what sir, I see you, you know, you've,

410
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,690
you've shopped us around and this
is the deal you've got over there.

411
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,630
I can do the here, I can take care
of you. We can beat that price.

412
00:26:24,631 --> 00:26:26,970
If he can't do that, he's gonna
loose. You know, if he goes,

413
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,400
let me check with my manager,
he could hang onto them,

414
00:26:29,401 --> 00:26:30,810
but there's a chance
he's going to lose them.

415
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:35,640
So sometimes instantaneous
isn't fast enough, you know,

416
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:38,190
it's gotta be,
it's gotta be quicker.

417
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:40,730
It's got to be able to happen with
no communications. And that's,

418
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:44,850
that's what this is referring to
it all.

419
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,230
It all been to be adopted as a principle
that the columns of an army should

420
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:53,430
always be kept United so that when the
enemy cannot thrust themselves between

421
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:54,264
them,

422
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:02,150
this is something that I always
preached to my seal leadership.

423
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,990
And that is that separating your forces,

424
00:27:06,991 --> 00:27:08,700
and sometimes you do
have to do it and it's,

425
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:12,900
and it's a completely acceptable tactic,
but is always better.

426
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,200
To be unified is always better,
to be unified.

427
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:19,320
It's always better to be close
enough that you could, in fact,

428
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,370
you can be separate,

429
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,940
but you don't usually always need to be
close enough to each other to support

430
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:27,930
each other. So if you know
you shouldn't be getting your,

431
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,840
you and your element shouldn't be
getting any further away from me and my

432
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:34,320
element, then we could be able to support
you. So what's the range of my guns?

433
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:38,160
What's the accurate range of my guns?
You know, if I can shoot three or 400,

434
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,810
500 meters,
you know,

435
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,890
if you have eight guys and I have eight
guys and now we're getting further than

436
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:45,930
that apart,
that means I really can't support you.

437
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,940
So now we're alone and that's
not how you want to be. So again,

438
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:53,190
there's times where people
have to take calculated risks,

439
00:27:53,191 --> 00:27:56,790
but we always would say,
you know, keep that, um,

440
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,553
keep

441
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,710
together. Stay together as much as
you can. And, and again, this is, uh,

442
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,570
I'm,
I'm talking tactics now.

443
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,660
This is like for people that are in
the military that are listening to this

444
00:28:09,661 --> 00:28:12,600
podcast, this is something to
keep in the back of your mind.

445
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,760
Stay where you can cover and move.

446
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,580
Stay where you can mutually
support one another.

447
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,550
They should move to Ho up when for any
reason this maximum is departed from the

448
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:30,310
detached core should be
independent in their operations.

449
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,360
They should move towards a fixed
point at which they are you to unite.

450
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,740
They should march without hesitation
and without new orders and should be

451
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:41,890
exposed as little as possible to the
danger of being attacked separately.

452
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,820
This to me, goes into contingencies
where if we do get separated,

453
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,540
you've got to know, okay, if I get
separated and it's been an hour,

454
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll go into this fixed point and
we're going to make it happen. Yeah,

455
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,420
that's something you're at the mall,
he's going to say when you got a family,

456
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:57,790
this is something you actually
have to legit come up with. Okay.

457
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:00,670
If we get separated, here's what a
meeting, here's what time. And by the way,

458
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:03,670
if we don't make that muster for whatever
reason, the next one will be here.

459
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,030
And so you've gotta have a little
contingency planning with the FAM,

460
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,180
make sure it's all good.
What does muster mean?

461
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:15,280
A muster means bring everyone together
and counts how many people you have.

462
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,820
I'm going to say that next time.
Yeah. Say mastery is at so and so.

463
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,573
Next one.

464
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,251
Uh,

465
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:30,251
well-established maximum war is not to
do anything with your enemy wishes and

466
00:29:30,531 --> 00:29:33,950
for the single reason that
he does. So wish. Okay.

467
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,980
That is pretty self explanatory.

468
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,470
Don't do anything that
your enemy wants you to do.

469
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,620
You should therefore avoid a field
of battle, which he is, reckoned,

470
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,450
ordered and studied.

471
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,110
Okay?

472
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:51,950
You should still, you should be
still more careful to avoid one,

473
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,760
which he has fortified and
where he has entrenched himself.

474
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,510
A corollary of this principle is never
to attack in front a position which

475
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:10,120
admits of being turned.
So one of the,

476
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,770
one of the biggest pieces that I
take away from this, and this is you,

477
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,530
you should still be more
careful to avoid one,

478
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,010
which he has fortified and
where he has entrenched himself.

479
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,550
I used to give my guys
a warnings about this,

480
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:32,410
about these fixed positions that are
entrenched and I wasn't talking about

481
00:30:32,411 --> 00:30:35,950
combat. You don't, I was talking
about, I was talking about debates,

482
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,900
I was talking about debates
because you w w there's,

483
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:45,901
there's guys in the seal teams that
would lure you into some kind of a debate

484
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,483
about

485
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,740
let's say the strategy that the seal
teams were using it that the strategy,

486
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,200
the way things that they, the way they
thought things should be done. And

487
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,090
the thing is these guys would sit
there and have this argument with,

488
00:31:05,091 --> 00:31:08,000
amongst themselves and with other people.
And so they would,

489
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,530
they would have these kind of fortified
positions on them and you roll into it

490
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,940
and you're like, you got your experience,
but you're not ready for a debate on it.

491
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,250
You're not ready for these
fortified positions that you're,

492
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,580
they're going to throw at you.
So don't engage in these battles.

493
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,160
And you know, it's like, uh,

494
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:29,900
I was doing Sam Harris's a podcast,

495
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,770
you know, and I, and I went up there and
there were some things that I thought,

496
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:34,011
well,
you know,

497
00:31:34,011 --> 00:31:38,990
he might ask me about some of these
philosophical opinions on things.

498
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,950
And of course, I mean, I was
ready to, to have a discussion,

499
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,960
but what I wasn't ready to do was like,

500
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:49,790
stand my ground on the topic
of freewill, right. With,

501
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:54,680
with Sam Harris, a guy that's
literally written an entire book,

502
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,690
which is called free will, and he has
his own. So for me to engage with him,

503
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,450
it's an entrenched position. It's
something that I'm not going to, I,

504
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:07,940
I'm not going to win. And An, and
in fact, you know, it's not like,

505
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:10,530
it's not like Sam Harris is a pretty
mellow guy. He was all, it goes, well,

506
00:32:10,531 --> 00:32:11,420
you're not getting in an argument,

507
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:15,380
but I wasn't even gonna make any
practical points. Right. You know?

508
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:20,000
And so I'm just always very cautious.
And again, in the business world,

509
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:25,210
you get people that understand some
part of their business so well,

510
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,930
you have to be very careful and you
have to plan when you're going to engage

511
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:34,910
with them because otherwise you're
going to get just destroyed.

512
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,940
Yeah. Sam is a position on freewill
is pretty fortified out, so,

513
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,220
yeah, and it's, and, and,
and the scary thing is,

514
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,190
is that you can actually
be right about something,

515
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,980
but if you're going to get someone
that's got a four to five position,

516
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,820
you can still lose the argument
and look stupid. Right.

517
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,190
Not that there's anything wrong
with looking stupid, but you know,

518
00:32:58,191 --> 00:33:01,220
you want to pick your
battles. I mean, right. Yeah.

519
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,040
Not that Sam Harris isn't
right or anything like that.

520
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:04,800
Okay.

521
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,920
Yeah, I seen in general. Yeah.
No, no, no. It was, it wasn't,

522
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:10,770
definitely wasn't talking
specifically about, about Sam Harris.

523
00:33:10,771 --> 00:33:12,480
That's just a great example because again,

524
00:33:12,481 --> 00:33:16,690
it's a guy that's literally
written a book called free will.

525
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,670
So if he wants to talk about it, and I
want to say, no, I don't agree with you,

526
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,500
he's just ready for that. You
know, just like if we said,
you know what, Hey, let's,

527
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,750
let's train Jujitsu.
I'm ready for that.

528
00:33:27,751 --> 00:33:31,260
I've been in every position that
that is going to happen in Jujitsu.

529
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,770
I been in there a thousand
more times than him. Yeah.

530
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,540
Because I've been trading
for a really long time,

531
00:33:36,541 --> 00:33:39,300
so we have that discussion about freewill.
It's gonna be the same thing.

532
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,710
I'm just not going to,

533
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,820
we have bringing to the table is that
kind of like the guys who PR who are

534
00:33:44,821 --> 00:33:49,200
really into conspiracy theories, you
know, and they, if they present it to you,

535
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:52,590
they're going to have all this research
and websites and documents that they

536
00:33:52,591 --> 00:33:57,030
went to in your, you know? Yeah. Even
even if your facts are like stronger,

537
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,610
they have so many other weapons
and they're ready for that war.

538
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:03,080
They're ready for the entrenched and
fortify like are you're saying. Exactly.

539
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,340
Yeah, exactly. That's a hard word to, to
win. Yeah. Because I'm not going to go,

540
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:09,330
like we've talked about before,

541
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:13,530
I'm not going to go and they dig through
the interwebs and watch video upon

542
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:15,980
video about just to fight that war.
Just to fight too.

543
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,180
It's not even necessarily to
prove anything right or wrong,

544
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:21,420
it's just you gotta just
fight and win that war. Yeah.

545
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:27,230
The passage from the defensive to the
office IV is one of the most delicate

546
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,250
operations of war.
And I actually have a uh,

547
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,420
a note of what I think is the most
difficult operation of war and that is

548
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,380
linking up under fire.
And again, you know what,

549
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,300
now I'm talking tactically

550
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,323
yeah.

551
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,990
To two people that are listening to this
show that are currently serving in the

552
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:53,790
military and the police linking up with
other units other from the units under

553
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,770
fire is,

554
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,590
is one of the most difficult things to
do because there's so much confusion.

555
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:02,880
People are shooting, you're trying
to bring friendly units together.

556
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,150
There can be bad guys in between you
and obviously if there's bad guys in

557
00:35:06,151 --> 00:35:09,480
between you and the other good guys
and you have to shoot at the bad guys,

558
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,510
that means you're shooting at good
guys to your bullets can hit them.

559
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,920
So it's a very, very, very
challenging thing to do.

560
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,880
So be careful when it comes
time to link up under fire.

561
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:23,700
And you know what I think
of when I think of this,

562
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,710
I think of when you see
companies merge, it's, they're,

563
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:42,120
they're, you know, they're,

564
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:46,020
they're moving together and there's just,

565
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:51,200
it's very challenging.
There's confusion. There's uh,

566
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,730
a disorder.
There is a,

567
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:59,070
there is a merging of the chain of
commands of two different groups.

568
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,260
So it's,
it's very challenging.

569
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,590
And so anybody that's going into
some kind of a merger scenario,

570
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,560
you've got to recognize out of the gate
that this is one of the most hardest

571
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:10,710
military operations and one of the
hardest business operations to do.

572
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,710
So you've got to be aggressive with it.
You've got a planet,

573
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:17,040
you've got to be clear about it.
You've got to do it in a simple way.

574
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:22,320
Don't think that you're just going to
merge two companies together and it's

575
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:26,310
going to be all good. It's a very
challenging event to participate in.

576
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:40,310
It is a violation of correct principles
to cause cores to act separately without

577
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:47,361
communication with each other in the
face of a concentrated army with easy

578
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:53,220
communications.
This is the same theme,

579
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,290
this idea that you want to stay together,
you want to work together,

580
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,130
you want to,

581
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,060
and I'll fill this ward out there in
case people didn't catch the first time I

582
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,820
said it. The word mutually support
or the words mutually support.

583
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,070
You want to mutually support each other.

584
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,560
Now what we find in the business world
is you get different elements inside of a

585
00:37:13,561 --> 00:37:17,190
company that do not work together.

586
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:19,350
They don't communicate with each other.

587
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,130
And it's the same thing as being out on
the battlefield and you got your platoon

588
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:27,210
and I got my platoon and if we're not
talking, how are we helping each other?

589
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,920
It's we're not. And if we, if,

590
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:34,500
if you try and hit the enemy and the
enemy's bigger and stronger than,

591
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,180
than you are alone.
Well he's going to beat you.

592
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:40,560
And then if I try and you know later,
even if it's an hour later,

593
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,000
I try and hit him,
well guess what?

594
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:44,190
He's bigger and stronger than you and
he's bigger and stronger than he's going

595
00:37:44,191 --> 00:37:47,370
to be me. We have to join together
and work together. It's so obvious.

596
00:37:47,371 --> 00:37:49,110
I know it's obvious and you know what,

597
00:37:49,111 --> 00:37:52,440
you would think it'd be obvious to people
on the battlefield and yet Napoleon

598
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:56,910
himself felt the need to write that down
as a maximum because people don't do it.

599
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,950
And, and, and Lafe and I, in
our book we have the, the,

600
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,840
the law of combat called cover and move.
And that's what it is.

601
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:07,350
It's about mutual support. It's about
working together. It's about teamwork.

602
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,590
And it's about not having silos in your
organization where one person just is

603
00:38:14,281 --> 00:38:17,370
going to be on their own or one elements
on their own and other elements on

604
00:38:17,371 --> 00:38:18,900
their own and another
elements on their own.

605
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,640
Are you talking about like
just structurally where
that's how you kind of run

606
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:24,211
the business?

607
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:27,210
Or are you talking about where they
don't communicate because I don't really

608
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:30,530
like that guy. It's both those, Oh,
now what we'll structurally, I mean,

609
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:32,040
you have to have things structurally,

610
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:36,250
there will be separate elements
structurally in the military. I mean,

611
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:40,570
in the military there's, you know, there's
artillery, that's a separate element.

612
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,800
There's, you know, logistics. That's
a separate element you've got,

613
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:47,920
then you've got the infantry companies,

614
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,440
and there'll be separate infantry
companies, but they're all separate,

615
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,110
but they have to work together.
They have to mutually support.

616
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:55,990
They have to communicate. They failed
to do that. Well, in a business,

617
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:58,000
you've got the same thing.
You've got a sales branch,

618
00:38:58,001 --> 00:39:00,370
you've got an operational branch,
you've got an administrative barriers.

619
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:03,640
You've got to a marketing branch in,
and all those branches,

620
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,390
they have to work together
too, right? Yeah. So,

621
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,550
and um, on a personal
level that say, you know,

622
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,250
I don't like Jenny from HR,

623
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,080
so I can't stand Jenny from HR,
so we're not going to,

624
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,900
we're not going to talk to her. You know,
we're just, we don't need her, you know,

625
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:27,280
we're just going to continue without
her kind of kind of attitude. Yes.

626
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,720
That's a classic example.

627
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,980
If anyone decides that for
personal reasons or whatever,

628
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,420
they're not going to
work with someone else.

629
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,450
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
And it does happen in,

630
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,400
it happens so often in businesses.
It's ridiculous.

631
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,850
And it happens in the military too.
It happens in seal platoons.

632
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:48,790
It happens in interservices and,

633
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,520
and that's just a huge obstacle
to overcome. And like I said,

634
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:56,080
that's why Napoleon Bonaparte
himself put it in his maxims.

635
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,760
Another one,

636
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,760
one battalion sometimes
decides the issue of the day.

637
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,840
So which battalion is that going to be?

638
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,040
We don't know which element is going
to hit that critical situation.

639
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:18,420
This to me is the bringing it back to,
you know, being prepared and giving,

640
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,390
you know,
making your teams strong,

641
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:26,391
all of them in balancing them because
one battalion or one element or one team

642
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:31,200
or maybe even one person can
decide the issue of the day.

643
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:34,320
So balance is very important.

644
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:39,283
Okay.

645
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:42,720
I just couldn't help just go and
tactical with Napoleon on some of these.

646
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,320
I really couldn't.
It's just great stuff.

647
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,410
I understand it should be adopted as
a principle never to allow intervals

648
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:55,950
through which the enemy can penetrate
between the different cores forming,

649
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,660
forming the line of battle.

650
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,640
Unless you have laid a snare into
which it is your object to draw him.

651
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:08,260
This is very simple for people that
are in the military to understand it.

652
00:41:08,261 --> 00:41:09,350
I just kind of talked about it.

653
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,340
If you and I are the good
guys and we have guns,

654
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:18,430
just you and me and we allowed a bad guy
to get in between you and me and he has

655
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:22,280
a gun.
Now what does that do you do?

656
00:41:22,281 --> 00:41:24,260
You understand what that does?

657
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:28,400
If I want to shoot the guy and I missed
by a quarter of an inch, who does it hit?

658
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,090
Potentially me. It hits you. It
hits you because it's Murphy's law.

659
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,980
Not even potentially it will
hit you. That's Murphy's
law. So you want to always,

660
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,930
again,
this goes back to you know,

661
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,960
unity of command and having your elements
working together and not allowing

662
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,470
other elements to penetrate
in between your forces.

663
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,750
Interesting. How he added.
Unless it's to snare him,

664
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:55,990
like unless that's like you're
baiting him into a trap kind of thing.

665
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,510
That's interesting how you
added that specifically.

666
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,730
That's kind of a dope little thing to do.

667
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,150
Yeah, it is. It.

668
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,520
I don't know if Napoleon would've said
it was a dope little thing to do, but,

669
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:13,490
but it Kinda is though. That's the
thing. And this is the next one.

670
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:14,930
Same theme.

671
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:20,290
The camps of the same army should always
be so placed as to be able to sustain

672
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:25,520
each other, right? You always have
to be able to mutually support

673
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:32,450
mutually support,
as you would say.

674
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,120
That is important.

675
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,660
A good general good officers
commissioned and noncommissioned,

676
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,370
good organization,
good instruction and strict discipline.

677
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:58,380
Make good troops independently of
the cause for which they are fighting

678
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,880
independently of the cause
for which they are fighting.

679
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,720
A good general good officers commissioned
and noncommissioned, good organization,

680
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:10,430
good instruction and strict discipline.

681
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,540
Make good troops independent of the
cause for which they are fighting.

682
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:20,650
So you can actually just have a incredibly
strong force that can operate at a

683
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:30,270
high level regardless of the cause
that they're fighting for. Right.

684
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,700
Just because they have those things,
right?

685
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:37,920
Yeah. Like kind of what I've told
you before, where if you, you know,

686
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:40,550
you were trained in discipline,

687
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:44,060
trained in all these things all the way
down to just, okay. For example, if you,

688
00:43:44,061 --> 00:43:47,870
if you are trained in by whatever means,

689
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:52,871
you're trained to show up on time
every single time where you know,

690
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,420
never be late to the point where being
late could very well be the end of the

691
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:01,130
world for you. Thank you. Train
that hard and never being late.

692
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,900
That's going to keep, oh, for a certain
situation like you're in the military,

693
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:08,600
right? So we can never be late in the
military. So now when you get out,

694
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:13,250
when you show up for work, when you
show up for drinks with your friend,

695
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,930
chances are you're never going to be late.
Of course. And that goes for, you know,

696
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,620
skill is the discipline and everything
else you're trained in. Yeah.

697
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,340
The first quality, and this is now
we're just going to get after it.

698
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:33,500
[inaudible] the first quality of a soldier
is constancy in enduring fatigue and

699
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:40,500
hardship.
Courage is only the second.

700
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:50,460
So the first quality of
a soldier is constancy in
enduring fatigue and hardship.

701
00:44:51,101 --> 00:44:51,700
That is the,

702
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:56,110
this is Napoleon Bonaparte saying
that the most important thing,

703
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:58,590
the most important quality
of a soldier is that they,

704
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,750
that they can endure fatigue and hardship.

705
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,670
Courage is only second poverty,

706
00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:11,850
privation and want are the
school of the good soldier.

707
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:18,450
So now when you look at any of
the elite military training,

708
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,000
okay.

709
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,730
Schools that those get that
people could put through and well,

710
00:45:25,731 --> 00:45:30,150
what is it about? It's about poverty,
privation, and want, you know,

711
00:45:30,151 --> 00:45:35,010
it's about being hungry, cold, tired,
miserable. That's what they do.

712
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,960
You know,
privation,

713
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:42,770
I looked at word up actually a state
in which things that are essential for

714
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:48,060
human wellbeing are lacking.
And that's what they do.

715
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,620
And you know, for me, you know what
I was talking about, like, you know,

716
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:54,300
I don't sleep a lot.
I wake up early.

717
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,420
That's one of those things that
it was pretty natural to me.

718
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,350
Luckily there's some biological
genetic reason or whatever,

719
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,350
but that was very helpful to me.

720
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,340
Very helpful for me to not
have to sleep a lot. Yeah.

721
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,350
And being able to suffer
through that well was,

722
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:17,400
was beneficial. And you know,
there's a lot of guys that have that,

723
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,210
that talent and people that don't have
that talent have a rough time. Yeah.

724
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,220
As you know,
as warriors in a real sense,

725
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,280
you should by all means encourage the
soldiers to continue in the service.

726
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:41,140
This you can easily do by testifying
greatest steam for old soldiers.

727
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,290
They do that very well in the
military. You know, the older,

728
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,100
more experienced veteran
soldiers get a lot of respect.

729
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:52,300
The pay should also be increased in
proportion to the years in service.

730
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,640
There was a great injustice in having no
higher pay to a veteran than to recruit.

731
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,560
So that's, that's good.
Now when I read this,

732
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:06,820
this didn't particularly strike me
as an important maxim to bring up,

733
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:11,821
but it reminded me of a story
that always stuck with me.

734
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,380
And so I was over in Ramadi
and I was working with a,

735
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,670
with a battalion called the first of
the five oh six band of brothers. Sure.

736
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:26,410
Red Curry,
just unbelievably awesome.

737
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:30,130
And our ROIC soldiers.

738
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And I went over there for a meeting with
the commander of the battalion and I

739
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:40,570
showed up to the meeting early.

740
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,350
Of course I was meeting him in
his office and this guy was, uh,

741
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,980
was just an incredible leader
and an incredible soldier
and really an incredible

742
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:51,724
man

743
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,470
that I could not have
any more respect for.

744
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:01,870
And I'm not saying his name right now
because I don't want to interrupt his

745
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:04,060
privacy and his world,
you know,

746
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:07,660
I don't know if he wants to have
his name sat on a podcast, you know,

747
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:10,420
when we talk about them in the book and
I don't put his name in there either.

748
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:14,080
And again, this is out of respect
for people's privacy and also out of

749
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,740
security reasons.
You know,

750
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:22,630
he doesn't want to have the insurgence
and terrorists to the world knowing that

751
00:48:22,631 --> 00:48:25,180
he was this guy. So, but
I will tell you this,

752
00:48:25,181 --> 00:48:29,590
the guy was just a fantastic leader
and so I went to this meeting with him.

753
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,320
This is just a one on one meeting.
I forget what we were talking about,

754
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,410
but I showed up early and he's in there
and there can hear him, you know, he's,

755
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,610
he's kind of talking to a soldier.

756
00:48:36,611 --> 00:48:38,800
I can't hear what he's saying
now there's just a soldier.

757
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,880
And what's interesting about this is
these, the army, see in the seal teams,

758
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,570
when you go, when you join a seal
platoon for two years or whatever, how,

759
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,500
however long it's going be,
you stay in that seal platoon,

760
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:55,860
you do a workup cycle and then
you go out on deployment and

761
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,173
okay,

762
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,420
the army does a little bit differently.
The army,

763
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:07,421
you could be three months into a year
long deployment to Iraq and they will

764
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:11,930
just, uh, they'll just leave.
They'll, there'll be their time,

765
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,870
their time in the army is
up and they'll go home or,

766
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,690
and then some new guy will show up and
they'll be in the middle of deployment.

767
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:20,240
And that's how they do it. The seal
teams doesn't really do that, you know,

768
00:49:20,241 --> 00:49:23,570
you kind of stick together for an entire
straight six or seven months. Delimit.

769
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,940
So I show up to this meeting with the
battalion commander and the soldier that

770
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:37,460
was in before walks out
and, uh, the colonel,

771
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:40,040
I sat down and said, hey sir, how you
doing? Good to see you. He's like, hey,

772
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,990
good to see a frog man.
And he said, you know what,

773
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,960
that right there is a soldiers getting
out of the army. And I said, oh,

774
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:53,300
it's interesting how you guys do that.
And he said, yeah. And He, and I said, uh,

775
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:53,690
yeah,

776
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:56,780
what do you say to these guys when they're
getting out of the army and this is

777
00:49:56,781 --> 00:50:00,830
the middle of a deployment? And he
looked at me and he said, you know,

778
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:02,510
okay,

779
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,680
when I deal with a soldier that's
getting out of the army, he said,

780
00:50:06,681 --> 00:50:11,120
a lot of people will say, you
can't leave us now. You know,

781
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:15,500
you got to stick it out with us.
You got to stay here, we need you.

782
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:21,350
And he said, when I deal with a
soldier that's getting out of the army,

783
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:27,730
I look at him and I shake their hands
and I thank you for your service.

784
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:32,023
And

785
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:38,540
that to me was just awesome to have a
totally different attitude because the

786
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:42,250
seal teams is like that as well.
If someone's going to get out of the seal,

787
00:50:42,251 --> 00:50:44,490
teams are going to be on the middle of
deployment. But when you get back though,

788
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,220
Yo, I'm getting out and everyone says all
you're a quitter, or blah, blah, blah,

789
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:51,690
and it's just a different attitude.
And what does that,

790
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,720
what does it tell you about your community
when you say, Hey, you know what?

791
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,600
I'm going to move on. I'm going to take
care of my family. I got to, you know,

792
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,230
I got whatever going on in my life and
I'm going to get out of the seal teams.

793
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,320
And people are like, oh, you're
a quitter. And that's normal.

794
00:51:04,321 --> 00:51:06,510
And they do that in every branch.
It's not just the seal teams.

795
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,460
And here was this guy
and his attitude was,

796
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:10,830
he's going to say thank
you for your service,

797
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,520
appreciate everything you've done
and I wish you the best luck.

798
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,540
That guy is more willing to change
his mind because he's like, wow,

799
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:22,260
I'm working for an incredible
leader of the army's awesome. Right?

800
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,410
And that that story always
stuck with me about,

801
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,270
about how to treat people,
about how to treat people.

802
00:51:30,271 --> 00:51:35,271
This is a guy that put his life on the
line for months on end and all he did was

803
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:40,920
just say thank you for your service.
Yeah, that's a leader right there.

804
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:46,803
Next one.

805
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,570
It is not by harangues
at the moment of engaging

806
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:59,250
soldiers are rendered brave
veterans hardly listened
to them and recruits forget

807
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,290
them at the first discharge of a Canon,

808
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,400
if speeches and arguments
are at any time useful,

809
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,650
it is during the course of the campaign
by counteracting false reports and

810
00:52:11,651 --> 00:52:13,030
causes of discontent,

811
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:18,720
maintaining proper spirit in the camp
and furnishing subjects of conversations

812
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,500
in bivouacs.

813
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,710
The several objects be maybe attained
by the printed orders of the day.

814
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,000
And so this is again,
as a leader in a leadership position,

815
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,740
this,
he's basically saying,

816
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:38,910
look at the moment of combat all you're
yelling and screaming and trying to

817
00:52:38,911 --> 00:52:41,410
motivate people. It was too
late. The veterans like the,

818
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,980
the veterans aren't gonna listen
to you and the recruits did.

819
00:52:43,981 --> 00:52:45,810
Once the cannon goes off,
they're not hearing you either.

820
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,960
So your main focus needs to be,
you know,

821
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,960
during the the non firefight scenarios.

822
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:55,920
That's when you get people with the
mindset that's going to drive them through

823
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:58,770
these bad situations.
If you're trying to do this,

824
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,820
trying to encourage people during the,
during the firefight, you're late.

825
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,073
Okay,

826
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,170
theme of the night.

827
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:17,310
Nothing is more important in war than
unity in command when therefore you are

828
00:53:19,181 --> 00:53:24,181
carrying on hostilities against a single
power only you should have but one army

829
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:28,410
acting on one line and
led by one commander.

830
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:35,760
Does that even need explanation?

831
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,290
Not really, no, not
really. Unity of command.

832
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,400
There are certain things in war of which
the commander alone comprehends the

833
00:53:47,401 --> 00:53:48,360
importance.

834
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:54,350
Nothing but his superior firmness and
ability can subdue and surmount all

835
00:53:54,511 --> 00:53:57,870
difficulties.
This is the burden of command.

836
00:53:58,050 --> 00:54:00,990
This is recognizing when you're in a
command position and when you're in a

837
00:54:00,991 --> 00:54:01,980
leadership position,

838
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,160
there are some things that are yours
alone and you have to drive from the top.

839
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:12,470
And I talk all the time about leadership
being at every level and how the lowest

840
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:17,550
ranking guy is a leader and the person
above him as leader all the way through

841
00:54:17,551 --> 00:54:21,270
the whole chain of command. But
this statement, which I agree with,

842
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,360
as much as I know that
leadership throughout the
chain of command is infinitely

843
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:29,183
important.

844
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:33,840
It is important as a leader to understand
that there's some things that you and

845
00:54:33,841 --> 00:54:35,220
you alone are going to understand,

846
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:40,221
and it's your responsibility to ensure
that that piece of the battle is handled

847
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,690
correctly.

848
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,523
Hmm.

849
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:55,300
This one's a little bit long.
I'm going to read it anyways,

850
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:02,110
to authorize generals and officers to lay
down their arms by virtue of a special

851
00:55:02,111 --> 00:55:06,850
capitulation to under any
other circumstances than
when they constitute the

852
00:55:06,851 --> 00:55:11,260
garrison of a four to five place would
unquestionably a be attended with

853
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:15,880
dangerous consequences.
To open this door to cowards,

854
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:19,470
to men wanting an energy
or even misguided,

855
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:24,220
brave men is to destroy the
military spirit of a nation

856
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,990
from Napoleon.
There can be no surrender.

857
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:32,733
Okay.

858
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,880
An extraordinary situation
requires extraordinary resolution.

859
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:38,743
Hmm.

860
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:44,550
Note taken underlined in red
and extraordinary situation
requires extraordinary

861
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,380
resolution.

862
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:55,260
How many things apparently impossible
have nevertheless been performed by

863
00:55:55,261 --> 00:56:00,030
resolute men who had no
alternative but death,

864
00:56:02,090 --> 00:56:04,730
strong words,
very strong words.

865
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:11,560
And we could go throughout military
history and find case upon case where I

866
00:56:12,351 --> 00:56:13,190
would tell you yes,

867
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:17,540
absolutely that commander made
a wise decision to surrender.

868
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:22,070
And you know that's,
there are situations where that happens.

869
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:28,110
But I think the main point of this
is that to have that out there,

870
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:34,390
to have that as a thing,
right, right. Is Not Smart,

871
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,550
is not smart.
And you know,

872
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:41,380
going in with MMA fighters and
telling him, I'm like, listen,

873
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,310
if you get caught in a submission,
don't tap, let it break.

874
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,830
If you get could a choke go to sleep,
just Dee Dee, there's no submission.

875
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,060
You are not tapping.

876
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,000
Now I've said that to guys and I've
had some guys get out of some crazy

877
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,540
submissions that they should have tapped
and maybe they got a little bit injured,

878
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:02,440
but they got out.

879
00:57:02,950 --> 00:57:06,610
And I've also had guys get caught in like
some devastating submissions and been

880
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:09,040
like, Oh, you know what? Okay,
I'm going to tap because,

881
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:15,570
but the fact that that attitude wasn't out
there. Right, okay. And that like, like,

882
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,430
okay, you know what if you get
caught, you know what I mean?

883
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,320
You're not going to say
to a fighter, okay, look,

884
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:23,740
if you could call it in a bad arm
lock, you know, just tap. No, no.

885
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:27,820
If you're going out on a bad arm lock,
get out of it in competitions.

886
00:57:27,821 --> 00:57:32,010
Let him break an MMA fight.
Yeah. I mean obviously not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

887
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:35,380
Well, yeah, in training, sorry
folks, if you're in training,

888
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,840
tap early and tapped often.

889
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,500
Yeah. Okay. So when you say having
that be a thing that's out there,

890
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:45,170
meaning there's almost no,
I don't want to see a shame,

891
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:50,030
but almost like etiquette is to
nuts. Surrender. That's etiquette.

892
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:54,260
And it's so much an etiquette where it's
here, you don't surrender. Here it is.

893
00:57:54,261 --> 00:57:56,000
It's written in plain English.
Don't swear it. Right,

894
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:58,300
right. And it's not even an etiquette.
There's a better word for it.

895
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:02,180
There's a word, I don't know what
it is, but it's not etiquette. It's,

896
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,500
it's our ethos,
right?

897
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:08,290
It's our ethos is do not surrender.

898
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:12,780
Right. So when someone does
surrender, when it's a good move,

899
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,720
how you say like every once in a
while there is, it's like, man,

900
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:19,980
there was literally no other
option that could be conceived.

901
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:22,430
Yeah. Yeah. But to not have it out there,

902
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:27,050
you know that that commander took it to
the nth degree and said, you know what?

903
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,790
All of my men are going to die for no
reason now if I continue on with us,

904
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,450
so therefore we are going to surrender
and an and hopefully we'll come back to

905
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:36,284
fight another day.

906
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:40,170
Yeah. Otherwise, yeah,
it's, if, you know, if,

907
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:45,220
if I don't know someone even has this
much mental weakness going in and he could

908
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:49,850
get and that could kick in at a whole
nother time and now he's under this

909
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:52,580
certain kind of mindset that,
man,

910
00:58:52,581 --> 00:58:56,650
I could look for the easiest way out
right here. You got real tired or man,

911
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,730
my shoulder got hurt on that last
one. So maybe I'll just, you know,

912
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:05,060
but if he's in that mindset that don't
give up, you just can't surrender,

913
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,090
he won't even consider that.
That wouldn't even enter his mind.

914
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,260
That's what I'm talking about.
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

915
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:18,160
Such conduct, such conduct ought
to be prescribed, pronounced,

916
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:22,460
infamous and punishable with death.
The generals,

917
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:26,570
officers and soldiers who in battle
have saved their lives by capitulating,

918
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,100
ought to be decimated.

919
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:34,030
He commands the arms to be surrendered
and those who obey him are unlike traders

920
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,180
and deserve capital punishment.
So they saying if you give up,

921
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,970
you should give up the guy.
That's exactly what they're saying.

922
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,550
That's exactly what they're saying.

923
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,440
Now we're going to get
in a little bit of a,

924
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,460
something that we now refer
to as extreme ownership.

925
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:00,830
A general in chief cannot exonerate
himself from responsibility for for his

926
01:00:01,321 --> 01:00:05,430
faults, by pleading an order of
his sovereign or the minister,

927
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,200
when the individual from whom it proceeds
is at a distance from the field of

928
01:00:10,201 --> 01:00:15,201
operations and but partially or not at
all acquainted with the actual conditions

929
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:19,080
of things.
So you,

930
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:22,050
if I tell you to do something
and it doesn't go well for you,

931
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:24,720
you're out in the field and I told you,
hey,

932
01:00:24,721 --> 01:00:26,970
charge this machine
gun nest and you do it.

933
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:29,850
And everyone dies and you come back
and say, hey, it wasn't my fault,

934
01:00:29,851 --> 01:00:34,470
the [inaudible] fault. The point is
here. No, it doesn't work that way.

935
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:36,750
Does not work that way.

936
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:40,853
Okay.

937
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,013
Hence

938
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:49,720
it follows that every general and treat
chief who undertakes to execute a plan,

939
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,670
which he knows to be bad,
is culpable.

940
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,780
So if I tell you to go attack that machine
gun nest and you know it's a bad plan

941
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:01,940
and you executed anyways, your
fault, that's kind of like, I mean,

942
01:01:01,941 --> 01:01:06,941
that whole idea is you take
responsibility for your direct actions,

943
01:01:08,751 --> 01:01:13,370
right? So it's kind of like if you do
the opposite of that, it's like, okay,

944
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,140
I, you know, I was speeding, I got
caught speeding, I got a ticket.

945
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,890
Is that my fault? Because yes,
it's my fault. But in a way,

946
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,050
if I don't want to exercise this concept,

947
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:28,670
in a way it's my parents fault for having
me or maybe not teaching me the value

948
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:33,350
of following traffic, uh, I'm not
gong to have this discussion with you.

949
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,730
That's just completely ridiculous.
It's the same thing. No,

950
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:41,060
you can't blame your parents
for your speeding echo, Charles.

951
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:43,010
That's what I'm saying. I'll let
you do that. That's the point.

952
01:01:43,011 --> 01:01:44,490
That's the point of making it.

953
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,620
That's the point here is that
if you're doing something,

954
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:50,360
if this is even more of an extreme point,

955
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:54,470
this is if your parents tell you to speed
and you go out and get caught speeding

956
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:57,450
and pulled over and you go,
Hey, my parents told me to
spray even more directly.

957
01:01:57,451 --> 01:01:59,930
Yeah. That's what I'm saying
is you knew it was wrong.

958
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,280
You knew you shouldn't be doing it,

959
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,320
and what Napoleon is saying is it's your
fault. You're culpable. Gotcha. Period.

960
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:09,620
Period.
Would you suggest,

961
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:13,490
let's say period,
you knew it was wrong.

962
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:18,910
Would a better plan of action be
expressed that you know that the the or

963
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:22,140
whatever is wrong? Yeah.
You should be like, Hey, I'm
not doing this. Oh, in fact,

964
01:02:22,141 --> 01:02:24,780
he goes on.
He should communicate his reasons,

965
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:29,810
insist on a change of plan and finally
resign his commission rather than become

966
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:35,040
the instrument of the, of his army's
ruin. This is just the, this is the most,

967
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,680
probably the most powerful thing
we're going to talk about tonight.

968
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:38,843
I'm going to read it again.

969
01:02:38,910 --> 01:02:42,600
A general and Treif cannot exonerate
himself from responsibility for his faults

970
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:45,300
by pleading an order of his
sovereign or the minister,

971
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,170
when the individual from whom it proceeds
is at a distance from the field of

972
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:54,090
operations and but partially or not at
all acquainted with the actual condition

973
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:57,090
of things. So this is a, this is an
order that's coming on from high,

974
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:59,220
from somebody that doesn't know.
Hence,

975
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:04,110
it follows that every general in chief
who undertakes to execute a plan,

976
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:06,360
which he knows to be bad,
is culpable.

977
01:03:09,910 --> 01:03:14,320
He should communicate his reasons,
insist on a change of plan,

978
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,520
and finally resign his commission.

979
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,700
So quit his job rather than become
an instrument of his army's ruin.

980
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:30,830
Every general in chief who in consequence
of orders from his superiors gives

981
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:34,950
battle with the certainty of
defeat is equally culpable.

982
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:41,630
This is ownership. This is,
hey, I got told to do something.
I don't agree with it.

983
01:03:41,631 --> 01:03:43,580
Hey boss, look, you
gotta listen to me here.

984
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:45,920
This is not the way we need to
execute this. Here's a better plan.

985
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,500
Here's another plan. Here's
a, here's an alternative.

986
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,420
Because if you give battle
with the certainty of defeat,

987
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:58,540
you're culpable regardless of who told
you to do what individual responsibility,

988
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:04,180
and this is especially important to have
this concept coming from somebody that

989
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:09,581
was as egotistical and expected so
much discipline from his troops to have

990
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:17,630
Napoleon himself saying this, like if
it's a bad order, you shouldn't do it.

991
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:20,330
This is Napoleon saying this.

992
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,500
So that's how important
it is to have this,

993
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:29,150
this culture in your organization
to make sure that everybody knows,

994
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:32,660
regardless of what you get told,
you've got to do the right thing.

995
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:38,060
And it's everyone's
individual responsibility
to take extreme ownership of

996
01:04:38,061 --> 01:04:41,330
everything that's happening and
not just say, you know what?

997
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:43,340
I'm going to point my point,
my finger up the chain of command.

998
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:47,870
I blame them when something goes wrong.
I've talked about this before.

999
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:51,140
You know how many times I blamed my
bosses for things that went wrong? Zero.

1000
01:04:51,710 --> 01:04:56,030
Never blamed my bosses it. How could
it ever be their fault? I was in charge

1001
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:00,500
and if they told me to do something
that was stupid, I would tell him, look,

1002
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:03,080
I'm not doing that. Here's
why. Let's find a better way.

1003
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,200
The first qualification of a general in
chief is to possess a cool head so that

1004
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:25,621
things may appear to him in their true
proportions and as they really are.

1005
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:31,623
It's beautiful.

1006
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:37,080
It's a beautiful statement to possess a
cool head so that things may appear to

1007
01:05:37,211 --> 01:05:41,470
him in their true proportions
and as they really are,

1008
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:46,710
he should not suffer himself to be
unduly affected by good or bad news.

1009
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:54,540
The impressions which are made upon his
mind successively or simultaneously in

1010
01:05:54,541 --> 01:05:59,190
the course of a day should
be so classified in his
memory that each shell occupy

1011
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:04,191
its proper place for sound reasoning
and judgment result from first examining

1012
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:10,550
each of these varied impressions by itself
and then comparing them all with one

1013
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:15,000
another.
So you're gonna hear all these things,

1014
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:19,650
all these different impressions.
You're going to get rumors,

1015
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:24,240
gossip reports,
probably heard this,

1016
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:27,540
the first report in war is always wrong
can to hear all that stuff and you got

1017
01:06:27,541 --> 01:06:32,250
an, you got to detach from it. You can't
get emotional. You got to categorize them.

1018
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:34,020
And then once you hear them all,

1019
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:37,170
you can look at them and assess
them all in their own light.

1020
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:39,023
Okay?

1021
01:06:39,110 --> 01:06:40,490
There are reason they're there.

1022
01:06:40,491 --> 01:06:45,491
There are some men who from their
physical and moral constitution deck,

1023
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:50,591
everything in the colors of
imagination with whatever knowledge,

1024
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:55,640
talents, courage, or other good
qualities. These may be endowed.

1025
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Nature has not fitted them for the
command of armies and the direction of the

1026
01:07:01,461 --> 01:07:06,290
great operations of war. So anybody
that gets emotional, that clot,

1027
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,480
that debt,
here's something and let's it cloud.

1028
01:07:08,481 --> 01:07:10,910
They're decisions that
gets too close to problems.

1029
01:07:10,970 --> 01:07:12,770
They're not cut out to lead and war.

1030
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:17,750
And I 100% agree with that and they're
not cut out to lead in any situation.

1031
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:18,693
Hmm.

1032
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:31,070
To be familiar with the geography
and topography of the country,

1033
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:33,950
to be skillful in making reconnaissance,

1034
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,000
to be attentative to
the dispatch of orders,

1035
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,110
to be capable of
exhibiting with simplicity,

1036
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,960
the most complicated movements of an army.

1037
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:50,480
These are qualifications that should
distinguish the officer called to the

1038
01:07:50,481 --> 01:07:52,220
station of Chief of staff,

1039
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:57,940
and my favorite of those is to be
capable of exhibiting with simplicity.

1040
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:02,170
The most complicated movements of
the army. I talk about all the,

1041
01:08:02,171 --> 01:08:06,200
this all the time.
It's a one of our laws of combat.

1042
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:11,440
It's a chapter in extreme ownership that
we wrote about and simplicity and a lot

1043
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:15,440
of times we talk about giving
clear, concise orders, simple,

1044
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:18,050
clear and concise orders.
So that's,

1045
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:22,820
that's another mark of someone that
can lead well is someone that can take

1046
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:24,020
complex ideas,

1047
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,560
simplify them and communicate
them in a simple manner that like,

1048
01:08:30,251 --> 01:08:33,800
you know how in Jujitsu you'll,
you'll like people name move. Yes,

1049
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:37,890
they'll do like give, move the name, but
each move we'll have like, you know, four,

1050
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:42,700
five, six, 10 parts to that move details
that are important to make the move,

1051
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:44,710
you name it one move,
you've learned that whole move.

1052
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:48,460
So it takes these complex

1053
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,510
orders or move and simplifies it.
Yes.

1054
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:57,160
Especially when you're communicating do
this, he just said, and there there are,

1055
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,090
I mean there definitely are coaches that
can take complex moves and break them

1056
01:09:01,091 --> 01:09:06,091
down very simply and that is,

1057
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,900
that is what makes her good instructor,
right?

1058
01:09:07,990 --> 01:09:11,530
That is what makes a good instructor is
someone that can explain to you exactly

1059
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,260
what you do with your weight,

1060
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:18,580
exactly where you put your forearm
exactly and then and then explained to you

1061
01:09:18,581 --> 01:09:19,121
that you know what?

1062
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,760
This might be a little bit different from
you for you because you're a different

1063
01:09:21,761 --> 01:09:22,594
human,

1064
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,470
but here's exactly what I do and here's
the effect that I'm looking for when I

1065
01:09:26,471 --> 01:09:30,490
do it. Very simple. That's
what we're looking for.

1066
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:35,650
The first principle of a general in
chief is to calculate what he must do,

1067
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,870
to see if he has all the means to surmount
the obstacles with which the enemy

1068
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:45,730
can oppose him and when he has made his
decision to do everything to overcome

1069
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:49,450
them. Again, that's to
me is about commitment.

1070
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:55,650
Next war is composed of nothing but
accidents and Avo holding to general

1071
01:09:58,331 --> 01:09:59,020
principles.

1072
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:03,340
A general should never lose sight of
everything to enable him to profit from

1073
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:04,270
these accidents.

1074
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:09,010
That is the mark of a genius in war.
There is,

1075
01:10:09,011 --> 01:10:13,420
but one favorable moment moment.
The great art is to seize it.

1076
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:18,670
It's a business.
Obviously Jujitsu,

1077
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:23,680
obviously fighting, obviously these,
that's just, there's, there's moments,

1078
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:28,840
there's opportunity,
there's opportunity.

1079
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,830
And when you,
when you have that opportunity,

1080
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:36,880
the art is to seize it.
Very simply.

1081
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:40,360
Defensive War does not exclude attacking,

1082
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:43,600
just as offensive war does
not exclude defending,

1083
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:50,100
although its aim may be to force the
frontier and invade the enemy's country.

1084
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,760
I just think it's important
to not only think about, hey,

1085
01:10:57,761 --> 01:11:00,970
you should be attacking and defending
at the same time and defending and

1086
01:11:00,971 --> 01:11:04,600
attacking at the same time.
But also we got to remember the,

1087
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:09,610
the contradiction in the fact that he's
a guy that talks about offense, offense,

1088
01:11:09,611 --> 01:11:12,170
offense, but even he has to
balance that with defense.

1089
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:17,010
Even Napoleonic has to balance things.

1090
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,650
And we'll do the last one,

1091
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:31,140
uh, doubtful general who acts
without principles and without plan.

1092
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,000
Even though he lead,

1093
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:37,500
even though he lead an army numerically
superior to that of the enemy,

1094
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:42,480
almost always finds himself inferior
to the ladder on the field of battle.

1095
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Fumblings the middle
course lose all in war.

1096
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:58,430
And I just liked the fact that he's
talking about principled leadership.

1097
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,970
And I would say that
principled leadership,

1098
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:07,350
not just in a leadership position,
but as a person,

1099
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:10,620
what are your principles as a person?

1100
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:16,370
And if you have principles as a human
and you stand by those principles,

1101
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:23,100
you're going to be successful.
You're going to win.

1102
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,520
Whereas if you take the middle course and
you waiver or the you don't just don't

1103
01:12:28,801 --> 01:12:33,600
have principles on which to stand,
then you fall apart.

1104
01:12:34,410 --> 01:12:35,243
And

1105
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:41,550
I think that everybody should look to
define what their principles are actually

1106
01:12:42,851 --> 01:12:47,680
defined them. I can tell you that. I
would love to tell you that when I was,

1107
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,930
you know,
19 years old,

1108
01:12:49,931 --> 01:12:54,310
I sat down and wrote down Jockos
principles of life. I didn't do that.

1109
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,320
I, I wish I would have. And I,

1110
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:00,760
and I can tell you that as I
grew up in the seal teams there,

1111
01:13:00,761 --> 01:13:03,950
I probably added principles and I,

1112
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:06,160
and I added some bad ones
and I had some good ones.

1113
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:11,350
And I think that those,
those principles though,

1114
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:15,010
when you get to a point where you
know that your principals are solid.

1115
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:19,920
And honestly to me the best or the,

1116
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
the biggest thing I've done to define
the principles that I live by is really

1117
01:13:26,801 --> 01:13:29,200
the book that life. And I wrote
extreme ownership. That's the,

1118
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,560
that was the culmination of 20 years in
the seal teams and putting together the

1119
01:13:35,591 --> 01:13:38,800
principles that, that, that I live by and,

1120
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:41,520
and to survive by.

1121
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:46,530
So I think it's just very important to
think about what your principles are as a

1122
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:47,340
person,

1123
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,810
what you're trying to achieve and have
those principles like a guiding strategy

1124
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,770
underneath everything that you're doing.
Right.

1125
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,140
And that's one thing that's good
about these podcasts is that,

1126
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:03,270
you know, I'm, I'm, I've been lucky
enough to capture some of these, you know,

1127
01:14:03,271 --> 01:14:06,660
like the, the letters that we read
last time, these counseling letters,

1128
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,690
I'm talking about my
personal principles in those,

1129
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:11,860
those were my principles on how to lead.

1130
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:18,210
And so I think it's important to come
up with those principles and define them

1131
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:22,180
and let those principals reflect you,

1132
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:24,880
know who you are as a person
and what you want to be.

1133
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:30,900
And I wish that I would have been told
to do that when I was 13 years old

1134
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:37,030
because I think it is that
important as a person.

1135
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:39,400
Yeah.
And it,

1136
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,100
it seems like anyway that
defining your principles,

1137
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:49,710
it seems like that's a, um, that's
kind of an ongoing process. Yes.

1138
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:54,490
Because it's one of the things where
you think you have your principles,

1139
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:56,820
you know, but I don't
know, for example, you,

1140
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:00,980
you could have just heard it on some
speech that really resonated with you so

1141
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:04,360
you, Oh Dang. You think you have
these specific principles now,

1142
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:08,410
but you haven't really defined them.
You just kind of liked how that sounded.

1143
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:09,640
And you may be thought of one,
two,

1144
01:15:09,641 --> 01:15:13,030
three situations where the Dane that
applies to me and let me tell you

1145
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,380
what you're talking about right now.

1146
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,440
Your number one principle should
be free your mind and, and,

1147
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,210
and have humility to never say,

1148
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:26,500
the principles that I'm standing upon
are never going to change because I know

1149
01:15:26,501 --> 01:15:29,710
everything right now. And we've
talked about this before. Yes, I know.

1150
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,880
I would never,
if I look at myself 10 years ago,

1151
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:37,750
I know nothing compared to what I know
now. If I looked at myself 20 years ago,

1152
01:15:37,751 --> 01:15:38,860
I know even last,

1153
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:42,790
I'm just a lost animal out in the woods.

1154
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:47,680
So you have to, you know, build
these principles and like you said,

1155
01:15:48,670 --> 01:15:52,720
and I think there's a difference between
being a flip flopper like, you know,

1156
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:54,700
you hear politicians get, you know, oh,

1157
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:58,060
you're a flip flopper because you said
you don't support gun control and now you,

1158
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,730
and now you, you're, you do support
it. Now you don't support her,

1159
01:16:00,731 --> 01:16:04,570
whatever you do support
bringing in refugees or not. So,

1160
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:08,080
and people will get to call the
flip flopper and, and I actually,

1161
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:13,180
I think there's some core principles that
shouldn't change even for a politician

1162
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:17,860
and even for a person. But there's
a lot of peripheral, you know,

1163
01:16:17,861 --> 01:16:21,880
I think there's peripheral principles
that do evolve and do change and you do

1164
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:25,840
end up with different priorities in your
life. And I think that's okay. You know,

1165
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:28,360
there was a large portion of my life,

1166
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:34,780
what were the seal teams was absolutely
the most important thing and nothing

1167
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:39,670
else was even a close second,
including things like my personal health,

1168
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:42,310
including things like my own family,

1169
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:47,170
including things like my future,

1170
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:52,380
the everything was just completely
unimportant compared to the seal teams.

1171
01:16:55,450 --> 01:17:00,100
And while that makes for a fired
up seal and I wouldn't trade that,

1172
01:17:00,101 --> 01:17:01,570
I wouldn't even want to
change that principle.

1173
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,870
I mean that's what I needed
at the time to do a good job.

1174
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:08,590
But you know, at some
point I had to say, okay,

1175
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:11,960
I I need to think about something else.
You know,

1176
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:16,880
I need to evolve as a human and in,
you know,

1177
01:17:16,881 --> 01:17:19,250
little things like I need to
take care of my family, you know,

1178
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,850
I need to actually pay attention to them
and not just pay attention to my seal

1179
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:26,540
platoon or my seal task unit or
the guys I'm working with. So you,

1180
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:30,140
so I think it's okay to
evolve your principles,

1181
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:35,180
but I think more important is that you
need to define your principles and where

1182
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:35,691
you are.

1183
01:17:35,691 --> 01:17:40,691
And that also is a way to check your
growth and see what course you're on.

1184
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,580
You know, this is one thing that I talk
about when I was in the seal teams.

1185
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:47,750
I used to talk about this,

1186
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:52,250
the most important piece of
information on the battlefield.

1187
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,390
What do you think the most important piece
of information on the battlefield is?

1188
01:17:56,391 --> 01:18:00,830
Echo.
Echo has no idea.

1189
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,890
I can come up with an idea, but
it'll take a little bit. Yeah.

1190
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:07,880
So I used to ask that question to
everybody, to senior guys, junior guys,

1191
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:11,030
and they'd all kinds of, you know,
where you know where the bad guys are,

1192
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,910
what you know,
where the target is.

1193
01:18:13,911 --> 01:18:17,810
I mean everyone would have different
answers and there's actually only one

1194
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:18,644
answer.

1195
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:23,210
The most important piece of information
that you can have on the battlefield is

1196
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:27,230
where you are, is to know where
you are on the battlefield.

1197
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:31,340
Do you know where you're at if
you don't know where you're at?

1198
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,940
Does it really matter if you
know where the enemy is? No.

1199
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:37,850
Cause you don't even know where you
are if you don't know where you're at.

1200
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:42,260
Can you even navigate correctly? No.
Cause you don't even know where you are.

1201
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:45,500
If you don't know where you're at.
Can you get close air support?

1202
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:49,310
Can you call for aircraft to
come in and drop bombs? No.

1203
01:18:49,311 --> 01:18:53,990
You don't even know where you are. So
that piece of datum, when will you,

1204
01:18:53,991 --> 01:18:55,490
when you apply that to life,

1205
01:18:56,840 --> 01:19:01,250
how do you know where you are if you're
not tracking what your principles are?

1206
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,860
The answer is you're not.
You're not gonna,

1207
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:06,350
you're not gonna know where you are and
you're not going to see how you evolve.

1208
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:09,170
And when I work with businesses,
I use the same principles.

1209
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:12,980
Businesses will go out and
operate off of instinct.

1210
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:16,340
Now you have to trust your instinct
and you have to understand it,

1211
01:19:16,341 --> 01:19:19,700
but you also have to track what the
facts are. You know what I'm saying?

1212
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:24,020
Like where are your metrics?
How do you know what you did last year,

1213
01:19:24,021 --> 01:19:28,220
this time in profitability?
How do you know what you did in sales?

1214
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,960
How do you know what you did in product
development? If you're not tracking it,

1215
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:36,380
you don't know where you
are on the battlefield and
if you don't know where you

1216
01:19:36,381 --> 01:19:38,810
are in the battlefield year lost.

1217
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:43,990
So the year principals kind of just
continue to be more and more informed.

1218
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:45,631
You know how like you do,

1219
01:19:45,631 --> 01:19:49,160
you talk about when you're 13 or 16
however old where you think you have these

1220
01:19:49,161 --> 01:19:52,040
principles, because I don't know, you
listen to Henry Rollins, they're there,

1221
01:19:53,030 --> 01:19:57,770
but as you conduct yourself through
life with an open mind and all these,

1222
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,820
you're offered all these different
perspective that start to solidify your

1223
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:02,654
principles.

1224
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:07,930
So you talk about the difference
between a flip flopper in someone who's

1225
01:20:08,370 --> 01:20:11,160
who evolves openminded and evolves.
Yeah,

1226
01:20:11,161 --> 01:20:15,660
the differences that someone
who continuously evolves,

1227
01:20:15,661 --> 01:20:19,420
we'll have an open mind at the same time
have pretty concrete principles. Yes.

1228
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:21,510
So when they're offered
something significant,

1229
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:25,050
that is simply a
difference in perspective.

1230
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,870
That is gonna that's
going to essentially on a,

1231
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:29,940
in a fundamental way aligned
with their principals.

1232
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:32,040
Their principles are
fairness. And you know, these,

1233
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:35,910
these things that are in arguably good
as far as being part of the principles,

1234
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:39,180
they're gonna evolve when these

1235
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:42,770
separate perspectives
get presented to them

1236
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:48,930
and thus solidifying their
principals even more. Yes.

1237
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:53,900
In Echo, just use the word thus.
And I liked that. I liked that.

1238
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:57,410
That's true.
And I think that's a good,

1239
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:01,100
good thing to keep in mind as you know,

1240
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:04,550
people move forward is
what are your principles?

1241
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:10,580
How are they evolving? How are they
improving? Have they gotten better?

1242
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:13,480
Those are great questions
for every individual to ask.

1243
01:21:13,481 --> 01:21:18,140
And those are questions I'm asking myself
right now on the Jocko podcast live.

1244
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:22,130
It's happening.
So speaking of which,

1245
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,330
we got some questions. Speaking of
questions, speaking of questions,

1246
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,520
the first question in episode five,

1247
01:21:28,521 --> 01:21:31,970
you mentioned treating
people with a blank slate.

1248
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:36,650
How do you deal with misjudging a person

1249
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,960
in the event of you? Misjudging
yeah. So that was, you know,

1250
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:46,430
in reference to a person that, that
we went through a counseling sheet on.

1251
01:21:46,820 --> 01:21:50,300
And the fact was it,

1252
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:54,260
I'd heard some bad stuff about them,
you know, bad. He had a bad reputation,

1253
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:58,520
et cetera. And so I was
saying that, hey, you know, I,

1254
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:02,120
I treat everyone like a blank slate.
And

1255
01:22:04,430 --> 01:22:08,570
so first of all, I talked
about this before, is I set
low expectations for people.

1256
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,840
I don't have a super high expectations
of what they're gonna do and how well

1257
01:22:15,351 --> 01:22:16,190
they're going to deliver.

1258
01:22:16,191 --> 01:22:19,130
And actually somebody hit me on Twitter
today and said something along the lines

1259
01:22:19,131 --> 01:22:23,680
of, I like the fact that everyone
with you starts at zero, right.

1260
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,290
And, um, and he said, I'm the same
way. He's in. He was the same way.

1261
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,980
And I think that's a, that's
a pretty good attitude. Dab,

1262
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,940
like everyone starts at zero and you know,
and,

1263
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:35,630
and that's a better way to put it
in my opinion. Expectations. Yeah.

1264
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:37,790
Like are you okay? You have
a zero. And, and again,

1265
01:22:37,791 --> 01:22:39,320
I don't mean to sound
like a negative person,

1266
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:43,880
but I just don't set high expectations.
I said, I'm a zero. Right? Look,

1267
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:48,200
you show me who you are. I'm not
going to predict one way or the other.

1268
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:54,070
I understand that people do crazy things
and people are crazy in many ways.

1269
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,950
Their ego, their
personality, their issues.

1270
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:05,530
I mean people, their
emotions, people do things.

1271
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:06,364
So I don't,

1272
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,320
that's another thing that keeps me from
giving people all kinds of credit out of

1273
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:13,310
the gate.
And,

1274
01:23:13,311 --> 01:23:17,160
and I do weigh what other people say.
You know,

1275
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,760
I take it into account,

1276
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:23,740
but I definitely am careful to use my
own judgment and not cloud my vision with

1277
01:23:23,741 --> 01:23:25,500
what somebody else said about so-and-so.

1278
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:29,800
So how do I deal with misjudging a person?

1279
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:31,660
It's Kinda what we were
just talking about.

1280
01:23:31,810 --> 01:23:36,810
I don't set permanent judgment on someone
and say echoes bad and I don't like

1281
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:44,410
him and I don't trust him. That's
not a permanent thing. You know,

1282
01:23:44,490 --> 01:23:49,300
I, I'm gonna build from zero and I'm going
to say, Oh, you know what, actually, hey,

1283
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,480
he did a good job with that. Or,
Hey, you had my back on that.

1284
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:56,200
So I'm not stuck in my ways and I don't,

1285
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:00,490
I don't hold grudges against people and
say, this person's never going to change.

1286
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:05,500
That being said, man, it's hard to
change the spots of the leopard.

1287
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:09,550
You know, people are who they are
and it's a very difficult, yes sir.

1288
01:24:09,551 --> 01:24:13,930
Some people can grow and change and evolve
and that's great, but a lot of people,

1289
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:17,170
they are who they are and so you have
to take that into account as well,

1290
01:24:17,290 --> 01:24:20,660
right? Yeah. When you say
like trusting someone wins,

1291
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:24,270
let's say someone burns you in whatever
way and then you know, a week later,

1292
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:28,720
whatever, they had your back in a way
that was really unexpected compared to,

1293
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:29,980
you know,
that action that they did.

1294
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:33,370
So basically what that does is help
paint an overall picture of what kind of

1295
01:24:33,371 --> 01:24:35,530
person this is to you.
So where it's like, okay,

1296
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:39,370
maybe I can trust them in this type
of situation when these benefits and

1297
01:24:39,490 --> 01:24:42,940
detriments or are in play and
these other situations I can't.

1298
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:46,090
So it's kind of this, and then as you have
more and more experienced with people,

1299
01:24:46,091 --> 01:24:48,170
they paint more of a picture.
Yeah.

1300
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:52,130
So trust even saying trust is such
a broad brush, right. You know,

1301
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,850
it's certain incentives
are involves involved.

1302
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:58,210
You can't trust a certain person
to do or not do certain things,

1303
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,450
but offer up different incentives.
Then you know you can trust them.

1304
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:05,470
I think the same thing that you're just
saying is what I'm saying is I don't,

1305
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:09,940
I'm not going to miss judge
someone because my judgment
is not a permanent all,

1306
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:13,790
all powerful statement of one time.
Yeah.

1307
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:17,050
I'm constantly looking at
people and like you said,

1308
01:25:17,051 --> 01:25:21,580
learning impressions of their whole,
their whole entity,

1309
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:25,000
what they're all about
next.

1310
01:25:26,610 --> 01:25:29,220
So starting out in Jujitsu,

1311
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:32,670
how do you find a good gym in your area?

1312
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:37,120
Okay, so this is actually
a question. You know,

1313
01:25:37,121 --> 01:25:41,020
we plot to one out of many of
people that have hit us up on,

1314
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:46,590
on Twitter about where to find
a good Brazilian Jujitsu Gym.

1315
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:47,680
Because people,

1316
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:52,840
I think people have heard us talking
about Jujitsu and they heard me talking

1317
01:25:52,841 --> 01:25:56,530
about it with Joe Rogan. You know her,
we talking about what Tim Ferriss,

1318
01:25:56,531 --> 01:25:58,900
I mean it's something that I talk about
something that is definitely a big part

1319
01:25:58,901 --> 01:26:02,290
of my life. I know it's a big part of
your life as well. And so people think,

1320
01:26:02,291 --> 01:26:05,150
you know, I'd like to check
out and I think that's awesome.

1321
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:10,040
And if you're out there and you're going
to ask me if you should start Jujitsu

1322
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:14,330
and you're going to give me a whole bunch
of quantifiers that you're old or you

1323
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:15,620
work a lot,
are you,

1324
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:19,070
you've been sick or you've been injured
or whatever you're going to tell me and

1325
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:23,000
I can tell you 99.9 99 99.9% of the time,

1326
01:26:23,001 --> 01:26:25,250
my answer is going to be yes,
you should start Jujitsu.

1327
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:29,120
Except if your sickness is contagious
except of your sickness is contagious.

1328
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:33,470
Or if you're a bully or you're a sadist,

1329
01:26:33,530 --> 01:26:36,800
if you're an evil person that's hungry
for power, I'm, I'm going to tell you,

1330
01:26:36,801 --> 01:26:41,801
don't start Jujitsu because you're
going to use it for bad things.

1331
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:45,200
Yeah.
And even before that,

1332
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:50,120
I think you might get it turned on you.
You know how like,

1333
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:52,640
cause it's really easy
to depends on the school,

1334
01:26:52,641 --> 01:26:57,190
but for the most part it's really easy
to spot a believe when it comes to the

1335
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,850
gym and it and it doesn't farewell well
it doesn't feel it'll maybe farewell for

1336
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:05,930
a day or even maybe one five minute
matches, something like that.

1337
01:27:05,931 --> 01:27:09,740
But man it doesn't, yeah,
Jujitsu is a self regulating.

1338
01:27:09,950 --> 01:27:11,570
See for the most part,
yes.

1339
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:16,630
As self regulating seen very few people
can maintain and and most people with

1340
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:21,260
bully bullying attitudes don't have the
humility to continue in Jujitsu for a

1341
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:25,820
long time anyways. Yes, yes. So that's
another way that it's self polices.

1342
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:29,150
So how do you find a good,
a Jujitsu Gym?

1343
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,020
Obviously you start with Google,
you find out some locations.

1344
01:27:33,021 --> 01:27:36,980
To me proximity is very important.
So you want a place that's, you know,

1345
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:39,650
on your way to work on your way
home from work close to your house.

1346
01:27:39,651 --> 01:27:42,380
So somewhere that you're going to get in
there and train because you don't want

1347
01:27:42,381 --> 01:27:46,910
to sign up for a gym and never go
because it's too far to out of the way.

1348
01:27:46,940 --> 01:27:50,350
So proximity is definitely a factor.
Then you got to ask yourself,

1349
01:27:50,380 --> 01:27:51,860
what are you looking for?

1350
01:27:52,190 --> 01:27:57,050
Because Jujitsu gyms very
tremendously in how they're set up,

1351
01:27:57,051 --> 01:27:59,660
how they're run and all those things.

1352
01:27:59,661 --> 01:28:04,661
I mean there's really super traditional
Brazilian Jujitsu gyms where they,

1353
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:08,870
you bow before you get on the mat,
you bow after your,

1354
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:13,370
you bow to the instructor when you're
going to talk to him. You are very,

1355
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:16,250
they're very strict with uniforms.
So you know, only a white uniform,

1356
01:28:16,251 --> 01:28:19,370
you have to have this certain patch on
your uniform to represent the school.

1357
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,010
That's,
that's one type of

1358
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,300
atmosphere that you could have.

1359
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:29,180
Then you could have a very loose
atmosphere where it's like, you know,

1360
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,790
you're gonna come in, you're going
to train. There is no bowing.

1361
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,340
There's handshakes and there's respect,

1362
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:39,820
but it's not as overt and not as imposed
as it would be in a more traditional

1363
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:44,060
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school.
So what are you looking for?
You know, for me, I always,

1364
01:28:44,061 --> 01:28:47,030
you know, and, and if you
come to my gym, it's a very,

1365
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:52,480
it's a very relaxed atmosphere in terms
of traditionally imposed discipline.

1366
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:57,080
But when you roll there
will be disciplined in post.

1367
01:28:58,610 --> 01:29:00,080
But it's pretty dynamic though.

1368
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:05,380
Like we have such a big group of people
that to go in there and in to get a non

1369
01:29:07,521 --> 01:29:12,220
competitive role is you can easily
do that. That's true. In fact, you,

1370
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:15,210
it's easy to choose. It's
either easy to be like, okay,

1371
01:29:15,211 --> 01:29:18,560
I know Liz role with this group
and it's gonna. It's going be,

1372
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:20,940
I'm going to go here with this crew
today and they're going to bring in,

1373
01:29:21,030 --> 01:29:21,870
or you know what?

1374
01:29:21,871 --> 01:29:23,910
I'm going to show what these guys over
here and we're going to work on some

1375
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:27,570
technique and maybe I can ask this guy
about that. Yeah. So that's, that's good.

1376
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:31,050
That is good. Um, you
know, there's also a,

1377
01:29:31,051 --> 01:29:35,250
are you going to go to a school that's
very focused on sport Jujitsu, which is,

1378
01:29:35,251 --> 01:29:36,600
hey,
we're going to compete,

1379
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:41,870
we're going to learn the techniques that
are very applicable to two competing in

1380
01:29:43,831 --> 01:29:45,640
Jujitsu. Yeah. Um,

1381
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:51,140
or am I going to do something that's
more towards self defense and or MMA.

1382
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,990
And a classic example I think
of that is the, uh, is the 50,

1383
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:59,700
50 guard where in this
position in Jujitsu,

1384
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:03,870
if you don't know Jujitsu,
where if you're in a no rule situation,

1385
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:08,580
you're very vulnerable to a devastating
submission called the heel hook.

1386
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:11,790
And so it's,
but there's,

1387
01:30:11,820 --> 01:30:16,170
there's certain competition rules that
don't allow for heel hooks and that

1388
01:30:16,171 --> 01:30:18,900
position. So depending on
what kind of school you're at,

1389
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:21,080
one of them you're going to get,
you're going to be in a,

1390
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:25,620
in a different situation in that then
that one position. And, and you know,

1391
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:30,570
actually at our school we do, we do
both. But do you want to do MMA focus?

1392
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:32,820
Do you want to do GI or no GI?
And again,

1393
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:36,150
there's benefits to both
those and they're both fun.

1394
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:39,370
And I like training both. Um, so,

1395
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:42,390
so you kind of kind of think about
what you're looking for and then,

1396
01:30:42,391 --> 01:30:46,350
and then bring that into the school and,
and then go try some classes,

1397
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:49,260
take some classes at a school
and see what they're like.

1398
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,200
What are the other students like,
you know,

1399
01:30:52,201 --> 01:30:55,200
what kind of atmosphere is it a,

1400
01:30:55,201 --> 01:30:59,880
do they have like the similar goals? If
you want to compete, if that's your goal,

1401
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:03,270
then are the other people that
you talk to, are they like, yeah,

1402
01:31:03,271 --> 01:31:06,240
I compete all the time.
There's a tournament coming
up or are they like, yeah,

1403
01:31:06,241 --> 01:31:07,610
you know,
we can beat sometimes.

1404
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:10,050
Or actually I don't care about competing
because there's plenty of people that

1405
01:31:10,051 --> 01:31:13,950
train Jiu Jitsu. They don't care
about competing. Is there, you know,

1406
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:18,540
what's the attitude?
What's is their egos are people rolling?

1407
01:31:18,541 --> 01:31:19,650
If you try to kill you,
which,

1408
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:22,830
which 99% of the time and a Jujitsu
school is not going to happen,

1409
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:27,510
but it can happen, it can happen. So
what WWE and then, and then it's like,

1410
01:31:27,511 --> 01:31:30,960
what was the instructor like?
Is the instructor personal?
Is it is the instructor,

1411
01:31:30,961 --> 01:31:32,070
you know what we were
talking about earlier,

1412
01:31:32,071 --> 01:31:36,480
is he clearer as you concise as he
understand, can you understand him?

1413
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,350
Can you understand the way he's
explaining moves now there's,

1414
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:41,460
you got to give a little leeway there.

1415
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:44,400
If you jump into a class
that's an advanced class,

1416
01:31:44,401 --> 01:31:46,470
you're not going to understand everything.
You know,

1417
01:31:46,830 --> 01:31:49,710
and people ask me on how to get
started on Jujitsu and I tell him to go

1418
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,750
immersion training just like a language.

1419
01:31:51,751 --> 01:31:56,400
Just get in there and start training and
you're going to get destroyed at first

1420
01:31:56,670 --> 01:31:59,470
and then you're going to slowly learn and
the next thing you know that's fastest

1421
01:31:59,471 --> 01:32:01,810
way to learn languages to get an
immersed in it and do the same thing with

1422
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:06,580
Jujitsu.
Is The instructor having fun?

1423
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,650
Is the guy having fun or the girl?
Are they having fun teaching?

1424
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:12,850
Is it a fun thing?

1425
01:32:12,851 --> 01:32:17,440
Because you want you Jitsu to be fun
and you want the instructor to be having

1426
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:19,990
fun because there's instructors not
having fun. Well then what? You know,

1427
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:22,810
what are they going to be like in six
months if they're not having fun today?

1428
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:26,260
And then what, what are they going
to be like in six months? So that's,

1429
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:31,560
that's another important piece
when you talk about what, um,

1430
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:34,180
what you're looking for,
you know, in, in Jujitsu

1431
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:37,660
and in my experience,

1432
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:43,300
there's so many elements of
it to look for. Like if, you
know, when you, if you say,

1433
01:32:43,301 --> 01:32:47,650
okay, am I, do I want to learn
MMA learning MMA or fighting?

1434
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,240
Is the sport of fighting compared
to like for example, the, the,

1435
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:54,220
the Gracie Academy Torrance there.

1436
01:32:54,230 --> 01:32:58,360
Do you do to self defense in regards
to fighting getting into a fight or if

1437
01:32:58,361 --> 01:33:02,080
someone attacks you in a fight that's
way different than training in MMA

1438
01:33:02,470 --> 01:33:05,710
training. MMA is a sport of MMA. You're
going to learn a lot of moves. The,

1439
01:33:05,711 --> 01:33:06,100
you're not,

1440
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:10,450
you're probably not going to learn
things that a quote unquote an attacker,

1441
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,970
I mean you will,
but it's not focused on that.

1442
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,550
You're not gonna learn stuff that
an attacker is going to do to you.

1443
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:19,030
So in that differentiation is
just the fighting part alone.

1444
01:33:19,140 --> 01:33:22,900
It's not to mention the competition part,
the Biggie, the Nogi, the, you know,

1445
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:24,250
all these dynamic moves.
Like,

1446
01:33:24,251 --> 01:33:28,300
if you go 10th planet and 10th Planet
compared to like Gracie Academy,

1447
01:33:28,301 --> 01:33:32,950
Torrance are almost like two different
sports almost yet. And they are,

1448
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:37,390
but at the same time, you're going
to get, you're going to get Jujitsu,

1449
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:41,260
that that's a, you're going to
get you to do for you and it,

1450
01:33:41,610 --> 01:33:44,140
and that's the important thing
is you can't judge it too.

1451
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:48,730
And just like we talked about the
evolution of your principals, let your,

1452
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,950
you know,
your game should evolve as well.

1453
01:33:50,980 --> 01:33:54,070
And almost everybody that's never done
Jujitsu before. If you said, well,

1454
01:33:54,071 --> 01:33:57,910
why do you want to take Jujitsu? 90% of
them are going to say, oh, self defense,

1455
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:00,900
right? Because you know, people say,
I want to learn to defend myself.

1456
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,490
There's not too many people that are
going to be saying, you know what,

1457
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,030
I really have become interested in
this cerebral aspect of Jujitsu,

1458
01:34:07,031 --> 01:34:11,590
which maybe some people that listen to
us talk about it or listen to Joe Rogan

1459
01:34:11,591 --> 01:34:14,050
talk about it, you know, they'll say, oh,

1460
01:34:14,051 --> 01:34:18,130
that guy's talking about this thing
as if it's a very cerebral experience.

1461
01:34:18,131 --> 01:34:19,990
So maybe someone but,
but most people, yeah,

1462
01:34:20,100 --> 01:34:22,810
I want to learn how to defend
my cell phone and make sure so,

1463
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:26,860
but you're going to evolve past that
because after six months of training,

1464
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:28,960
you can handle yourself
on the street regardless.

1465
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:30,820
If you went to 10th or you
went to the Gracie Academy,

1466
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:32,950
you're going to be able to
handle yourself in the street.

1467
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:38,310
And so then it becomes an obsession
of how did that move happen.

1468
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,220
And so that's what you got to,
that's what you got to be ready to evolve.

1469
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:43,540
And when you're at that point,

1470
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:47,830
if you go to school a versus
if you went to school,

1471
01:34:47,831 --> 01:34:52,831
be your experience is going to be a lot
different and it's going to depend on

1472
01:34:54,071 --> 01:34:58,130
what you were looking
for in the beginning. But
nonetheless, yeah, if, if it is

1473
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,350
obviously if it's a Jujitsu
school yeah. That, that,

1474
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:03,410
that part's not really going to change.
Yeah.

1475
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,380
You're going to learn Jujitsu,
which is a beautiful thing.

1476
01:35:08,140 --> 01:35:12,220
The other thing that I got
to say is you got it Jujitsu.

1477
01:35:12,430 --> 01:35:17,140
As much as I love it,
Jujitsu is not a religion.

1478
01:35:17,770 --> 01:35:20,600
And you know,
the,

1479
01:35:20,610 --> 01:35:25,610
the black belt instructor at the
school does not have contact or direct

1480
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:30,430
communications with God.
Right?

1481
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:34,900
So just I think,
keep that in mind.

1482
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:38,170
It's a person that is trained in
a sport for longer than you. Okay?

1483
01:35:38,171 --> 01:35:42,130
So just keep that in mind.
It's not a cult there.

1484
01:35:42,131 --> 01:35:44,770
There should be an open atmosphere.
In my opinion.

1485
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,190
You should be looking for a Jujitsu
school that has an open atmosphere,

1486
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:52,750
not a cult controlling atmosphere.
Um,

1487
01:35:53,530 --> 01:35:57,850
you know, that being said, and,
and I said this already, respect.

1488
01:35:58,810 --> 01:35:59,920
Yes,
absolutely.

1489
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:03,850
You should respect the people that are
there and respect your training partners

1490
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:07,840
and respect your instructors for sure.

1491
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:12,870
But you shouldn't be worshiping them
and they shouldn't be expecting you to

1492
01:36:13,361 --> 01:36:17,200
worship them. So just be
advised, because Jujitsu,

1493
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:20,350
it should be fun. It should be
friendly, it should be engaging.

1494
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:23,560
The atmosphere should be good and it
should be competitive without being

1495
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,030
cutthroat. You know, you,

1496
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:29,890
you should want to go without fear of
having a death match every single night,

1497
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:32,640
unless that's what you're looking for.
And you just said that echo,

1498
01:36:32,641 --> 01:36:36,880
I mean like I go in every night
looking for a death match against Dean,

1499
01:36:36,881 --> 01:36:39,400
against you,
against Andy,

1500
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,890
against Craig or Greg.
I mean our crew of murderers,

1501
01:36:44,980 --> 01:36:46,960
I'm, I'm going in for a
death match every night.

1502
01:36:47,020 --> 01:36:49,660
And even when I don't want to death match,
I give it to them because,

1503
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:50,920
because that's how I'm getting better.

1504
01:36:50,921 --> 01:36:55,000
And that's part of my own personal
will to say, you know what? Regardless,

1505
01:36:55,420 --> 01:37:00,190
I'm in there to put it on the line and,
and throw it out there.

1506
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:02,620
And if they get the best
of me, cool. So be it.

1507
01:37:02,710 --> 01:37:07,710
I learned I got better and I definitely
got better than I would if I was either

1508
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:10,780
a sitting on the side of the mat,

1509
01:37:10,781 --> 01:37:14,620
be rolling with someone that's not
as good or see staying at home.

1510
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:16,080
So yeah.

1511
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:20,150
Yeah. That's so interesting how, how
it really does accommodate who you are.

1512
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:24,530
Like you, when you, when you go in
looking for it, a death match every night,

1513
01:37:25,250 --> 01:37:29,150
that totally makes sense because of who
you are and who I understand you to be.

1514
01:37:29,630 --> 01:37:34,100
But at the same time, in the same gym?
On the same mat. Yeah. Yeah. He can have,

1515
01:37:34,130 --> 01:37:37,360
there's people chilling and in
who's, you know, he's, you know,

1516
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:40,220
he ends up getting his black belt,
a bunch of knowledge,

1517
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:43,650
but he's not going for any death
match, you know, older guy. Um,

1518
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:47,810
that's what's so in my
opinion, good about it. Yeah.

1519
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:50,180
So eight accommodates who
you are so much like me,

1520
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:55,040
I do both like some days death match.
Sure. But most days, just like once every,

1521
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:56,010
every

1522
01:37:56,010 --> 01:38:00,110
two weeks, once every two weeks we
get the death match. Rebecca? Uh,

1523
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:03,420
so yeah, go out there, enjoy Jujitsu,

1524
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:05,910
but we'll make sure you
don't fall into a cult.

1525
01:38:08,820 --> 01:38:12,810
Next, do you eat fruit? And if so,

1526
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:16,410
how often? And if not, why not?

1527
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:24,270
No. So, okay. Do I eat fruit?

1528
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:30,000
Sometimes I eat fruit, but if you were
to ask me if you should eat fruit,

1529
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:35,370
I would basically say no. I don't
recommend it. And again, this is just a,

1530
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:38,910
if you talk to Dom D'agostino,

1531
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:43,590
who's a doctor or Mister Paleo
himself, Robb Wolf, have you,

1532
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:47,430
if you go and listen to his
podcast or doctor Peter Attia,

1533
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:50,160
who I've talked about before,
these guys,

1534
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:55,110
they know what they're talking about and
they will tell you what I'm telling you

1535
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:59,910
and these guys will back it up with
science, upon science, upon science,

1536
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:05,430
fruit, carbohydrates, Spike your
insulin level, just not good for you.

1537
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:10,590
Um, again, am I an extremist?
No. Have some blueberries.

1538
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:14,310
Get your blueberries on. Get your
blackberries on. That's awesome.

1539
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:19,590
But take a bunch of fruit and put it
with some apple juice and mix it up in a

1540
01:39:19,591 --> 01:39:22,190
blender and eat,
you know,

1541
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:27,270
400 grams of carbohydrate in
one shot. No, don't do that.

1542
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:31,560
It's not good for you.
Have you ever eaten,

1543
01:39:32,370 --> 01:39:35,040
and I'm not saying when you're
on the program, so to speak,

1544
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:38,460
have you ever eaten a whole box of donuts?
Negative?

1545
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:42,540
Have you ever eaten,
ate a bag of Hershey's kisses

1546
01:39:44,280 --> 01:39:48,210
than it did not make, did not work out
good? When you say you don't eat fruit,

1547
01:39:48,211 --> 01:39:52,190
that's more of like when you're on the
program, right? Yeah. And did your,

1548
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:56,390
you want to know when I'm on
the program? Yeah, but when,

1549
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:01,320
when are you on the wall?
But yeah,

1550
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:05,550
I when when you're,
when you're trying to eat clean,

1551
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:08,820
which you should be trying to eat clean
80% of the time as anyone will tell you,

1552
01:40:09,210 --> 01:40:12,880
um, you know, keep it clean
and, and keep it to, you know,

1553
01:40:13,020 --> 01:40:16,920
fat and in protein.
If you can do it,

1554
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:21,810
little bit of a subject change.
When,

1555
01:40:24,030 --> 01:40:24,863
if ever,

1556
01:40:25,170 --> 01:40:29,490
is it a good time to blow up at someone
to lose your temper will blow up at

1557
01:40:29,491 --> 01:40:34,410
someone and lose your temper? Two
different things, right? Does I think,

1558
01:40:34,411 --> 01:40:38,190
is it good? I think, I think most people
would think that they are the same thing.

1559
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:41,130
Losing your temper and
blowing up at someone.

1560
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:44,460
And I can tell you that is
almost never good to do that.

1561
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,840
And when I say almost never,

1562
01:40:45,841 --> 01:40:50,841
I mean never with the tiniest caveat of
there is some possible scenarios where

1563
01:40:55,061 --> 01:40:59,170
it might need to happen. So if you lose
your temper and you blow up at somebody,

1564
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,210
what do you,
what are you showing?

1565
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,820
You're showing that you
can't control your temper.

1566
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:07,630
And if you can't control your temper, then
what can you control? Right? That the,

1567
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:12,250
and I'm not saying you should show no
emotions because if you show no emotions

1568
01:41:12,251 --> 01:41:16,270
in your robot and robots can't lead
people and people don't follow robots.

1569
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:17,800
So there's some,

1570
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:21,850
obviously some level of
showing emotions is needed.

1571
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:26,800
But if you're losing your temper,
you're not thinking clearly.

1572
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:30,430
And if you're not thinking clearly
because you've lost your temper,

1573
01:41:30,431 --> 01:41:34,800
you can't even read their reactions
to what you're saying and you're,

1574
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:38,710
the fact that you're blowing up is,
is clouding your own vision.

1575
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:44,020
The fact that you're losing your temper is
clouding your own vision.

1576
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:49,720
And so you got to detach in order to be
observant in order to watch what your

1577
01:41:49,721 --> 01:41:50,560
actions are.

1578
01:41:50,860 --> 01:41:55,510
So if you do have to blow up and when,
okay,

1579
01:41:55,511 --> 01:41:58,280
so when, when is this almost
never happened? If you,

1580
01:41:58,281 --> 01:42:03,281
if you were working for me and you did
something wrong and I said echo and it

1581
01:42:05,051 --> 01:42:07,060
was grievous,
it was like pretty grievous.

1582
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:10,990
Like it could've got someone
hurt and I said, echo, hey,

1583
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:14,290
do this was bad.
This is what happened.

1584
01:42:14,530 --> 01:42:18,670
I don't know what I did wrong that
thought that made you think that would be

1585
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:18,970
okay.

1586
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:23,920
But whatever I image I gave you
that made you think this was okay,

1587
01:42:23,950 --> 01:42:27,160
I, this is the worst mistake I've ever
made. We can never let this happen again.

1588
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,150
Okay. And you're like, yeah, okay. And
then four days later you do it again.

1589
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:35,860
And I'd come at the same approach, maybe
a little bit different. Like, Hey, echo,

1590
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:39,490
I don't know if there's anything I could
do to make this more clear than I did.

1591
01:42:39,491 --> 01:42:40,960
What can I do to make you understand?

1592
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:45,010
So we might go three or four or five
iterations, maybe one more iteration,

1593
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:48,520
I should say three iterations of you,

1594
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:53,670
not you failing to do what you're supposed
to do and getting someone hurt her

1595
01:42:54,131 --> 01:42:56,830
almost getting someone
hurt. So now I go, okay,

1596
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:58,990
he hasn't listened to
the indirect approach.

1597
01:42:58,991 --> 01:43:03,100
He hasn't listened to the direct approach.
He hasn't. I've taken ownership of it.

1598
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:07,120
He hasn't taken any yet. I need to come
at them from different angles. Okay,

1599
01:43:07,121 --> 01:43:11,200
I need to lose my temper with them and
it's going to be a calculation and I

1600
01:43:11,201 --> 01:43:15,610
won't actually lose my temporary,
but I will raise my voice.

1601
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:16,660
I will get loud.

1602
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:21,750
I will point and I will make damn sure
that you understand that this infraction

1603
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:29,341
that you have committed is severe and
grievous and can never happen again.

1604
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:34,780
And that's the situation where I would
quote unquote blow up at somebody.

1605
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:38,230
It is so rare that

1606
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,470
it's so rare that in my military
career off the top of my head,

1607
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:49,600
I can remember one and only one
incident of this where I actually said,

1608
01:43:49,601 --> 01:43:53,060
you know what? This,
this was a bad mistake.

1609
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:57,200
I could see where these guys think they
might be able to get away with us again

1610
01:43:57,230 --> 01:44:00,760
in the future and I'm going to make sure
that they realize that was it the kind

1611
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:03,740
where they,
it's not like they made the same mistake.

1612
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:06,100
It was more like they
chose to do something,

1613
01:44:06,101 --> 01:44:08,630
they chose to do something a certain way.
And in my,

1614
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:13,780
my assessment of it was that they
would do it again if I didn't make it

1615
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:20,060
perfectly clear that this
could never happen again.

1616
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:22,010
And so I raised my voice,

1617
01:44:22,100 --> 01:44:25,760
I pointed in the face and you know,

1618
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,530
gave them 20 seconds of,

1619
01:44:31,250 --> 01:44:36,250
of intensity and the situation never
happened again and they apologized.

1620
01:44:39,590 --> 01:44:42,350
But overall not a good thing.

1621
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,430
Don't lose your temper people don't do it.
Yeah.

1622
01:44:46,431 --> 01:44:49,850
I would say losing your temper,
not blowing up at someone,

1623
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:53,990
losing your template for losing it.
You can be hard.

1624
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,260
It's going to be hard to think of a
situation where that's cool. Yeah. Okay.

1625
01:44:57,261 --> 01:45:00,740
And I'll tell you, you want to know when
I lose my temper or cause I'll tell you,

1626
01:45:00,890 --> 01:45:01,790
I do lose my temper.

1627
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:06,791
It happens once every six months and it
is almost always with inanimate objects,

1628
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:12,620
namely objects that print or copy

1629
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:18,890
or compute in some way.
You know, electronics,

1630
01:45:19,340 --> 01:45:22,160
sometimes I, I get, I get angry. Yeah,

1631
01:45:22,930 --> 01:45:27,710
you're going to probably want to
keep that in private areas, right.

1632
01:45:27,740 --> 01:45:29,630
You don't want people to see that.
Yeah.

1633
01:45:29,900 --> 01:45:34,070
Like my wife will hear me once
every six months, you know?

1634
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:36,800
And she'll come in and she'll
be like a printer then. Oh yeah.

1635
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:42,350
She says you're stupid. I go, I know. She
goes, it doesn't care if you yell at it.

1636
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:45,490
I say, yeah, I know. I
might experience that.

1637
01:45:45,491 --> 01:45:50,000
I found the same thing looking. We're
looking. Okay, here's the next question.

1638
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:55,430
Your specific lifting workout, your weekly
training schedule, including Jujitsu.

1639
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,600
This is a big question.
And this,

1640
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,590
for those of you that do
Jujitsu out there in the world,

1641
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:06,500
this is like when someone says, Hey,
Hey Jocko, how do I pass your guard?

1642
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:12,500
Cause I have a good guard. And so you
know someone that is a blue belch,

1643
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:18,050
we'll say, you know, hey, how do I pass
your guard? You know, and they, and,

1644
01:46:18,051 --> 01:46:23,051
and literally I have guys at the gym
that are brown belts and black belts that

1645
01:46:25,371 --> 01:46:28,310
pass my guard once every six months,
you know,

1646
01:46:28,610 --> 01:46:32,810
so my guard is good and you know,
here's a blue belt. Like, hey,

1647
01:46:32,811 --> 01:46:34,480
how do I pass your guard?
So this,

1648
01:46:34,481 --> 01:46:38,130
this question kind of reminds
me of that a little bit. Um,

1649
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:43,070
specific lifting workout
and weekly training schedule
on Jujitsu. So this is a,

1650
01:46:43,071 --> 01:46:47,450
this is a big ask. And here's
the problem that I have with us.

1651
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:53,730
I'm an individual and I have
strengths and weaknesses.

1652
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:58,790
I have whatever little injury thing
that I'm working through at a particular

1653
01:46:58,981 --> 01:46:59,814
time.

1654
01:47:00,240 --> 01:47:05,240
I have things that I liked to do and
I have things that I don't like to do.

1655
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,090
I have,
um,

1656
01:47:08,540 --> 01:47:13,140
I'm an individual and my
workout is for me and,

1657
01:47:13,170 --> 01:47:15,580
and I've taken, and I've,
you know, sometimes people,

1658
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,180
I'll go on a trip and there'll be a guy
that's an athlete and he'll say, oh, do I,

1659
01:47:18,181 --> 01:47:22,890
you know, I want to, I want to go through
one of your workouts with you. And I say,

1660
01:47:22,891 --> 01:47:26,490
okay. And I've done that.
And, and I've had guys,

1661
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:27,990
okay,

1662
01:47:27,990 --> 01:47:32,990
like almost hospitalized from going
through one of my workouts and

1663
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:38,280
that's not good.
And then I've had other guys,

1664
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:41,730
like there's guys out there that will
just crush me in a workout, you know?

1665
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:43,500
And especially,
you know,

1666
01:47:43,530 --> 01:47:48,530
there's workouts that I have that
I could beat most of the world in.

1667
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:49,770
You know,

1668
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:54,110
there's workouts that I have that
I could crush anybody in end.

1669
01:47:54,111 --> 01:47:56,760
Then there's workouts that some,
you know,

1670
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:01,530
Yoga instructor could put me
through that would crush me. Right?

1671
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,440
So my point is that you
get some people that I,

1672
01:48:04,441 --> 01:48:08,100
that would die due to one of my workouts
and you get some people that would it

1673
01:48:08,101 --> 01:48:11,760
be my one of my workouts is no impact
because they're an incredible athlete.

1674
01:48:12,570 --> 01:48:15,330
And so why would either one
of them want to do my workout?

1675
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,820
It's doesn't make any sense
that they would want to do that.

1676
01:48:18,270 --> 01:48:22,560
So what I've been trying to think,
cause I get asked all the time, we are,

1677
01:48:22,561 --> 01:48:24,270
what's your workout? What's your
workout? What's your workout?

1678
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:28,740
And it's what I've been trying to
figure out is how to do this. How do I,

1679
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:34,460
how do I communicate what
I'm doing and what I've,

1680
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:36,320
what I've been kind of

1681
01:48:38,090 --> 01:48:42,380
going through the idea in my
head is putting together a, uh,

1682
01:48:42,410 --> 01:48:45,920
like an ebook and I actually put this
out on Twitter. I was like, Oh yeah,

1683
01:48:45,921 --> 01:48:48,230
I'll do an ebook. And people like
Ebook, Ebook, yeah. Do it, do it.

1684
01:48:48,231 --> 01:48:50,700
So it's an idea that's already been
floated out there. Unfortunate,

1685
01:48:50,701 --> 01:48:52,490
there's not been a lot of
time to be writing ebooks,

1686
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:57,080
but what the focus would be would be,
yeah,

1687
01:48:57,110 --> 01:49:01,490
like the types of exercise that
I do. Yes. But, and you know,

1688
01:49:01,630 --> 01:49:03,770
kind of the numbers of that I,
that I do have them,

1689
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:08,780
but more importantly going to from a
leadership perspective is what is the

1690
01:49:08,781 --> 01:49:11,810
intent? What does the
commander's intent of my workout?

1691
01:49:11,960 --> 01:49:14,060
What am I trying to accomplish?

1692
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:19,360
Because for you and me to accomplish
the same thing is going to be a dif,

1693
01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:24,230
very different workout.
Right. If, if I want to,

1694
01:49:24,710 --> 01:49:28,070
if I want to take myself to a,
to a,

1695
01:49:28,071 --> 01:49:33,071
to an anaerobic threshold
for a total of 15 minutes,

1696
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:37,400
what I would do to get there is very
different from what you would do to get

1697
01:49:37,401 --> 01:49:39,050
there. It just, it just is,

1698
01:49:39,410 --> 01:49:44,060
if I wanted to destroy my
legs with heavy squats,

1699
01:49:44,120 --> 01:49:46,700
it would be very different between
what you would do and what I would do.

1700
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:49,300
So what's important is,

1701
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,630
is not the actual
exercises that I'm doing.

1702
01:49:52,631 --> 01:49:55,360
It's the intent and emi
achieving that a tent.

1703
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:58,180
It am I achieving that intent.

1704
01:49:58,570 --> 01:50:02,920
Like I can do a decent amount of pullups.
Right.

1705
01:50:03,680 --> 01:50:05,920
And,
and in one of my pull up workouts,

1706
01:50:05,980 --> 01:50:10,090
I might do 500 pull ups or 300 pull ups.

1707
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:15,490
There's a lot of people that can't do a
hundred pull ups. So just in the workout,

1708
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:19,870
right? Not 300 bullets. Yeah, no, I
can't do 300 per pull ups in a row. No.

1709
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:24,760
I wish I could, but, but my
intent is to, you know, Mack do,

1710
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:29,790
do a number of maximum sets of pull
ups and then do a number of slow,

1711
01:50:30,730 --> 01:50:35,320
you know,
very good form maximum sets and,

1712
01:50:35,321 --> 01:50:39,640
and the intent is to get stronger
at pull ups by doing, you know,

1713
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:42,880
have high number of maximum sets.

1714
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:46,990
And I think that intent to
give to people would say, okay,

1715
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:49,690
so that way if echo's not good
at Bob's and you go, okay,

1716
01:50:49,691 --> 01:50:51,280
well I'm going to go in and
I know what the intent is.

1717
01:50:51,281 --> 01:50:55,330
I'm trying to get to a point of
failure even on one single pull up.

1718
01:50:55,810 --> 01:50:59,800
And it might take you only 15 minutes
to do that and 30 pull ups, you know,

1719
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:03,700
or whatever the case may
be. And for someone that's
really good, a rock climber,

1720
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,800
it might take them,
you know,

1721
01:51:05,801 --> 01:51:09,460
45 minutes and they might be 600
pullups deep before they get there.

1722
01:51:10,150 --> 01:51:12,670
And so that's kind of the
idea I'm batting around.

1723
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:15,610
I don't know if people have
that really interested in that.

1724
01:51:16,180 --> 01:51:21,180
I think a lot of times
people want a formula

1725
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:26,760
and I don't think I'm going to give out
a formula because the formula is going

1726
01:51:26,761 --> 01:51:30,220
to be different for different people at
different times in their lives and ages

1727
01:51:30,221 --> 01:51:33,670
and body weights and you know,
male or female.

1728
01:51:33,671 --> 01:51:36,220
They're just all so many variables.

1729
01:51:36,640 --> 01:51:40,270
But I think if I can give out what
the intent of my workouts are,

1730
01:51:41,020 --> 01:51:43,810
then we're in the right place.

1731
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,240
Yeah.
But those,

1732
01:51:45,241 --> 01:51:49,260
those different variables and stuff that
that could very well be the reason that

1733
01:51:49,261 --> 01:51:52,290
people want your workout.
Cause it's this two things,

1734
01:51:52,291 --> 01:51:53,011
this is probably more than two,

1735
01:51:53,011 --> 01:51:58,011
but two big things that kind of come
along with wanting your specific workout.

1736
01:51:58,710 --> 01:52:02,940
And one would be just to kind of immerse
myself into what you go through in a

1737
01:52:02,941 --> 01:52:07,530
workout and how does that feel
and how do I kind of measure up,

1738
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:11,280
you know? Um, and then
so those two things,

1739
01:52:11,281 --> 01:52:15,330
like what does it feel like to do a Jocko
workout? Like how she, how hard is it,

1740
01:52:15,420 --> 01:52:18,450
you know, he's going to do, you
know, 600 pull ups in a workout,

1741
01:52:18,451 --> 01:52:21,270
limited lithy you know, like
how does that feel? You know,

1742
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:24,630
is that the hardest thing I've ever
done or you know, is that just all this,

1743
01:52:24,631 --> 01:52:28,500
you know, these workouts are,
that heart just goes right.

1744
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:30,830
That's the second part, does it, you know,

1745
01:52:32,250 --> 01:52:34,920
how do I measure up if he does,
you know,

1746
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:39,570
20 sets of squats with whatever,
wait,

1747
01:52:39,990 --> 01:52:40,890
how do I measure up?

1748
01:52:41,070 --> 01:52:44,280
Can I get all those 20 sets or can I
get that weight for 20 cents? You know,

1749
01:52:44,281 --> 01:52:47,060
so those two, one, they just want
to immerse themselves in your world,

1750
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:51,530
in your world as far as workouts go. And
the second one is, how do I measure up?

1751
01:52:51,620 --> 01:52:54,680
I know that's kind of what I think
when, when someone's like, Oh, here's,

1752
01:52:54,681 --> 01:52:56,720
here's our workout,
like those crossfit workouts,

1753
01:52:56,721 --> 01:53:01,520
like some of those just
mentally I do that like, okay,

1754
01:53:01,521 --> 01:53:06,010
this guy's doing 20 pull ups in a
row. Like how many can I do? You know,

1755
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:09,320
I measurement. And then at the
same time, it's like, this is,

1756
01:53:09,680 --> 01:53:12,440
you get to understand
what these crossfitters do

1757
01:53:14,530 --> 01:53:17,010
can be, you know, and then like I
said, they go back and forth that,

1758
01:53:17,011 --> 01:53:20,400
those two things. And I think
that that, that is interesting.

1759
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,370
Like if you were to tell me what
you did this morning for a workout,

1760
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:27,360
like I'd be interested on
top of the fact that, oh,

1761
01:53:27,361 --> 01:53:32,361
maybe I want to do that workout for me
for results for myself and yet your item,

1762
01:53:32,521 --> 01:53:36,120
it may or may not, I'll probably have
different results even if I do that.

1763
01:53:36,130 --> 01:53:37,410
The same workout as you for,
you know,

1764
01:53:37,411 --> 01:53:39,150
six months old might
have different results.

1765
01:53:39,151 --> 01:53:44,151
But that part about measuring up and
just knowing who you are and kind of what

1766
01:53:45,721 --> 01:53:48,840
you stand for. And this is the workout
that you do. Just understanding that.

1767
01:53:48,841 --> 01:53:49,740
I think that's significant.

1768
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:54,880
Yeah. I would love to tell you that
I'm some, you know, physical specimen,

1769
01:53:54,881 --> 01:53:58,930
but I'm not, I'm actually not the
strongest guy. I'm not the fastest guy.

1770
01:53:59,140 --> 01:54:01,900
I'm not the most flexible guy.
Um,

1771
01:54:02,200 --> 01:54:07,200
I try hard and I also am a result of my,

1772
01:54:07,960 --> 01:54:10,750
my physical aptitude is like a,

1773
01:54:11,650 --> 01:54:12,080
okay,

1774
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:16,750
is like a, is like a brownish gray, um,

1775
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:22,300
paint because I mix up so much stuff
in there that I'm the result of,

1776
01:54:25,450 --> 01:54:28,630
you know, I'm not bright red. Right.

1777
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:32,520
I'm not bright blue because
those two things, you know, the,

1778
01:54:32,590 --> 01:54:36,010
the strength has been mixed
with endurance, has been
mixed with flexibility,

1779
01:54:36,011 --> 01:54:38,920
has been mixed with all these
things had been mixed together.

1780
01:54:38,921 --> 01:54:43,921
And I don't want to get too much of
any of them because then I'm losing

1781
01:54:45,731 --> 01:54:48,550
something else. And so the,
so I'm kind of this, this,

1782
01:54:48,551 --> 01:54:53,250
this kind of average
in many categories and,

1783
01:54:53,260 --> 01:54:56,950
and my numbers in very few of them,
motor impress anybody.

1784
01:54:57,190 --> 01:55:00,250
You're pretty strong now. Yeah.
And, and, and, and, you know, like,

1785
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:03,010
but I'm not one of those people
that's on the mat that you go, man,

1786
01:55:03,730 --> 01:55:08,500
that guy is just freaking
strong. You know, we'll least, I,

1787
01:55:08,501 --> 01:55:12,910
it's hard for me to judge, but I know
that, uh, I guess people say, Oh,

1788
01:55:12,911 --> 01:55:17,840
you're strong. Yes. Yeah, I think that,
okay. You're like that guy on the,

1789
01:55:17,841 --> 01:55:19,660
you know, you ever play video games? No.

1790
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,780
So let's say you play a, I dunno,
a football game, you play football,

1791
01:55:24,781 --> 01:55:29,280
so when you analyze your players,
it'll have all these attributes,

1792
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:34,140
speed, hands, acceleration. Right. And
it's like, I don't know, zero to 10.

1793
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:36,660
So you're the guy who has all like eight.

1794
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:39,660
Yeah. Instead of the guy with
two tens and then a three.

1795
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:45,030
But like anybody that's listening this
podcast beat me in a bunch of categories.

1796
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:49,170
Yeah. You know, they got
tens and some stuff. Right,
right. Yeah. And, and I don't,

1797
01:55:49,710 --> 01:55:53,430
I don't have any tenants in
anything. That's okay. Not
everyone can have tenants.

1798
01:55:53,730 --> 01:55:57,750
Yeah.
Um,

1799
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:02,190
next question. Question. Yeah. Um,

1800
01:56:02,640 --> 01:56:07,640
would you talk more about how you view
aggression positive than negative?

1801
01:56:10,660 --> 01:56:11,493
Well,

1802
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:14,210
I like everything

1803
01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:21,340
in life and in leadership
and then your personality,

1804
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:26,240
it has to be balanced. Aggression has to
be balanced. And you know, one of the,

1805
01:56:26,450 --> 01:56:29,840
one of the things from,
from the book is, you know,

1806
01:56:29,930 --> 01:56:33,560
you gotta be aggressive but
not overbearing. So yeah,
you gotta be aggressive.

1807
01:56:33,561 --> 01:56:36,190
To be a leader,
you've got to be there.

1808
01:56:36,530 --> 01:56:38,150
Because if you're going
to make things happen,

1809
01:56:38,180 --> 01:56:40,140
you've got to be aggressive to
make things happen that you,

1810
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:44,450
you have to make things happen. You
know, I always say to people like, oh,

1811
01:56:44,451 --> 01:56:47,510
they want to make money. I'm like, well,
you use it. Make money. You have to take,

1812
01:56:47,511 --> 01:56:50,420
you have to take that money. It
doesn't get, I got a phone. Your House,

1813
01:56:50,450 --> 01:56:53,000
lean your lap. It's not going to
make itself. You have to take it.

1814
01:56:53,030 --> 01:56:56,120
If that's what your goal is in Jujitsu,
you're,

1815
01:56:56,121 --> 01:57:00,620
you're not going to get better just
by being, you have to take the,

1816
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:04,230
the progression. You have to
take it and make it happen. And,

1817
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:06,080
and that's the same thing
with anything in life. So,

1818
01:57:06,081 --> 01:57:08,630
so aggression definitely comes into play,

1819
01:57:09,260 --> 01:57:13,220
but for instance,
in a leadership position,

1820
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:15,890
if you're completely
aggressive all the time,

1821
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:20,920
your subordinates will not
want to communicate with you.

1822
01:57:21,201 --> 01:57:24,110
They won't want to debate with you.
They won't want to say, hey boss,

1823
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:26,770
I don't agree with what you're saying
here because they're afraid you're gonna

1824
01:57:26,771 --> 01:57:28,100
go, hey, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1825
01:57:28,101 --> 01:57:30,620
We're going to go my way or the highway.
That's what they're going to expect.

1826
01:57:30,621 --> 01:57:33,650
So you can't be overbearing,
you know, on the Mat,

1827
01:57:33,680 --> 01:57:37,520
you can't exhaust yourself with
aggression. And that's one of the things,

1828
01:57:37,521 --> 01:57:42,410
you know that I think from purple
to Brown belt, which is, you know,

1829
01:57:42,411 --> 01:57:42,860
you're,

1830
01:57:42,860 --> 01:57:47,810
you're six to eight years in the game
is where people start to calm down and

1831
01:57:47,811 --> 01:57:51,950
realize that that aggression needs to be
tampered and control and people have to

1832
01:57:51,951 --> 01:57:55,670
relax. Um, adding combat,

1833
01:57:56,420 --> 01:58:01,420
obviously being aggressive and being
dis aggressively decisive is important.

1834
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:05,660
But if you go too far with that,
you're running to your death.

1835
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:11,060
So you have to modulate your aggression.
You have to modulate your aggression.

1836
01:58:11,090 --> 01:58:14,420
You can't abuse it. You got to
use it, but you can't abuse it.

1837
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:21,320
And I don't want to discount
aggression in any way because you know,

1838
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:24,950
I always say that your default mode

1839
01:58:26,650 --> 01:58:29,140
should be aggression.
Like when you,

1840
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:32,110
when you hit the reset
button on your brain,

1841
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:36,640
you should come out of that reset being
aggressive because that, that beat,

1842
01:58:36,641 --> 01:58:38,890
be aggressive, be proactive,
make things happen.

1843
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:40,930
Okay.

1844
01:58:40,930 --> 01:58:42,040
Be on offense,

1845
01:58:42,190 --> 01:58:42,551
you know,

1846
01:58:42,551 --> 01:58:47,551
not sitting back and waiting
to be attacked or waiting
for a situation to occur.

1847
01:58:49,690 --> 01:58:52,120
No. Make that situation occur. Go.

1848
01:58:52,990 --> 01:58:56,680
So that's my view of aggression and,

1849
01:58:58,810 --> 01:59:01,110
and it just has to be balanced.
And there's other,

1850
01:59:01,111 --> 01:59:04,990
or some times where,
you know,

1851
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,910
if you meet aggression with aggression,
it's actually not good. You know,

1852
01:59:09,911 --> 01:59:10,890
you,
you see this in Jujitsu,

1853
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:15,520
you see this in escalating in when you're
either in a confrontation of some kind

1854
01:59:15,521 --> 01:59:19,480
to somebody aggressively escalating,
something might be a good choice.

1855
01:59:19,481 --> 01:59:22,060
It might be a bad choice.
You know, there's always the
bully that as soon as you,

1856
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:24,700
you say, hey, you know what,
I'd love to fight. In fact,

1857
01:59:24,701 --> 01:59:27,520
fighting is my favorite thing to do. Let's
go. I've got it. It's like, no man. Oh,

1858
01:59:27,521 --> 01:59:32,080
was it? I was just kidding.
So aggression will when there,

1859
01:59:32,590 --> 01:59:36,490
um, or you know, if someone's really being
aggressive and you just knock them out,

1860
01:59:36,550 --> 01:59:39,400
well then that's,
that's a better handling of the situation.

1861
01:59:39,610 --> 01:59:41,320
But there's also times where there's,
you know,

1862
01:59:41,321 --> 01:59:43,900
maybe there's multiple attackers or
there's someone that's, you know,

1863
01:59:43,901 --> 01:59:46,450
you're in the street.
It's,

1864
01:59:46,451 --> 01:59:50,230
it's always better in the street to
avoid the confrontation. You know,

1865
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:52,750
what does that person have a knife?
Does that person have a gay gun?

1866
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:55,660
Is does that person have
a communicable disease?

1867
01:59:56,020 --> 01:59:57,880
Does that person have
friends around the corner?

1868
01:59:58,030 --> 01:59:59,950
Is that personal lawyer
who's going to sue you?

1869
01:59:59,951 --> 02:00:04,450
I mean there's all these reasons to get
into to to not get into a fight in the

1870
02:00:04,451 --> 02:00:05,500
street.
So,

1871
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:10,830
so aggressively meeting aggression with
aggression is probably not that smart.

1872
02:00:11,381 --> 02:00:14,090
It's probably better to
avoid the scenario. And,

1873
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:17,800
and the more time you spend in,
you know,

1874
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:20,770
in combat sports boxing
and doing Jujitsu them,

1875
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:23,770
the more likely you are to be
able to be like, you know what,

1876
02:00:23,830 --> 02:00:26,860
I don't need to prove anything in this
guy. I'm, it's, it means nothing to me.

1877
02:00:27,490 --> 02:00:30,480
I proved myself on the mat every
single day. I got nothing to prove to,

1878
02:00:30,481 --> 02:00:32,410
to Joe drunk idiot over here.

1879
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:36,370
So I think that a Gra,
again,

1880
02:00:36,371 --> 02:00:40,570
I think your default mode
should be aggressive,

1881
02:00:40,630 --> 02:00:45,630
but make sure that you maintain enough
detachment of the situation that you can

1882
02:00:45,641 --> 02:00:49,660
see if you're being overly aggressive
and it's leading you to a bad scenario.

1883
02:00:50,980 --> 02:00:55,460
Okay, last question. You talk
about mind control. Okay.

1884
02:00:55,890 --> 02:00:58,230
Can you expand your
thoughts on that subject?

1885
02:01:01,830 --> 02:01:06,360
Mind control.
You know,

1886
02:01:06,361 --> 02:01:08,910
when people think of
the word mind control,

1887
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:13,500
they think of controlling
other people's minds.

1888
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:17,490
And when I think about mind control,

1889
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:20,250
I think about controlling your own mind.

1890
02:01:21,180 --> 02:01:23,010
Because you know,

1891
02:01:23,011 --> 02:01:28,011
while I am obviously a physical person
and we'd spend a lot of this podcast

1892
02:01:28,921 --> 02:01:33,270
tonight talking about physical
culture and I embrace physicality,

1893
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:38,750
but we are our minds and I'm not going to,

1894
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:40,700
you know, going, uh,

1895
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:45,980
into a Sam Harris Philosophical rant on
what it means and where the you actually

1896
02:01:49,611 --> 02:01:54,350
is and whether there's a soul or a brain
or whatever your heart or some other

1897
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:55,910
conjured up place.

1898
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:59,660
This is what I know is that you,

1899
02:02:01,160 --> 02:02:02,570
your mind,

1900
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:07,400
the thing that is listening and
comprehending these words right now,

1901
02:02:07,460 --> 02:02:10,400
that is you and that thing,

1902
02:02:10,830 --> 02:02:14,270
that mind you can control

1903
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:16,723
you.

1904
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:22,660
You are the machine and you can
control the machine and people ask me,

1905
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:29,230
how do I get tougher? Be Tougher. They,

1906
02:02:29,280 --> 02:02:32,660
they asked me,
how can I wake up earlier in the morning?

1907
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:36,380
The answer is wake up
earlier in the morning.

1908
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,100
How can I work out
consistently every single day

1909
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:44,390
workout consistently every single day?

1910
02:02:45,530 --> 02:02:47,270
How can I stop from eating sugar?

1911
02:02:49,310 --> 02:02:51,440
Stop eating sugar.

1912
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:56,730
What about the emotions?

1913
02:02:58,590 --> 02:03:02,220
How can I stop missing that
girl or that guy, whoever,

1914
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:05,400
whoever broke up with me,
how can I stop missing them?

1915
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:10,650
Stop missing them.

1916
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:13,760
Okay.

1917
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:17,630
That is mind control.
You have that ability.

1918
02:03:18,530 --> 02:03:19,790
You just have to assert it.

1919
02:03:20,090 --> 02:03:25,090
You have to decide that you're going to
be in control and that you are going to

1920
02:03:25,281 --> 02:03:27,530
do what you want to do.

1921
02:03:29,480 --> 02:03:34,220
Weakness doesn't get a vote.
Laziness.

1922
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:38,600
They don't get a vote. Sadness, no,

1923
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:43,220
no vote. Frustration, no vote. Negativity.

1924
02:03:44,870 --> 02:03:45,710
You don't get a vote.

1925
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:50,050
I don't even give my temper a vote.

1926
02:03:52,650 --> 02:03:57,650
So the next time that you're feeling
weak or you're feeling lazy or you're

1927
02:03:58,021 --> 02:04:00,360
feeling soft or you're feeling emotional,

1928
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:04,170
tell them that they don't get a vote.

1929
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:10,470
Tell them you are declaring
martial law on your mind.

1930
02:04:11,640 --> 02:04:13,830
You're declaring mind control

1931
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:20,100
and impose what you want on your brain.

1932
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:25,760
Impose the discipline and the power
and the positivity and the will

1933
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:33,560
and use that mind control to move your
life where you want it to be is the,

1934
02:04:37,170 --> 02:04:41,460
I always say get stronger,
faster, smarter, quicker,

1935
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,290
friendlier, more helpful, more driven.

1936
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:46,340
Okay.

1937
02:04:46,340 --> 02:04:49,040
Don't let your mind control you.

1938
02:04:51,590 --> 02:04:52,820
Control your mind

1939
02:04:54,860 --> 02:04:56,870
and once you control your mind,

1940
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:00,073
then

1941
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:02,600
you can set it free.

1942
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:11,150
And I think we'll close with that for
the day. Yeah, that's about all I've got.

1943
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:12,023
I right there.

1944
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:18,040
And you know if you're out there
and you want to communicate with us,

1945
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:23,150
you want to carry on this conversation,
you want to continue down this path.

1946
02:05:25,250 --> 02:05:27,200
You can do so on Twitter.

1947
02:05:29,360 --> 02:05:34,360
I'm at Jocko Willink and
echo is at Echo Charles.

1948
02:05:34,990 --> 02:05:35,823
