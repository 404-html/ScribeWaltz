1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,530
This is Jocko podcast number
one 74 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,380
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,763
So

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,010
I was the commander of
the training detachment,

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,260
which runs the tactical kind of advanced
training for the west coast seal teams.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,430
And when I was in that position,

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,300
one of the things that you have to do
when you're in a leadership position is

8
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:32,280
you have to give a valuations
for everyone that works for you.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,920
You have to basically write down and
evaluate how good they are and how well

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,970
they do their job.
This is normal for everyone in the navy.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,350
Then everyone in the military really.

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,610
And in the navy it's a 5.0 system
that you're getting graded on.

13
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:52,611
So 5.0 is the best and 1.0 is the worst.

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:57,180
I don't know if even go lower than
that. You probably can, but there,

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,390
and there are rules about how many
people you can put at the top.

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,450
You have to for, it's called forced
ranking. If you ever heard of that,

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,080
forced ranking means you have
to actually rank everyone.

18
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,120
So if you have 10 people working for you,
you have to rank.

19
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:12,901
This is my number one guy,

20
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:17,490
this is my number two guy all the way
down through number 10 and this is what

21
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:20,130
you cannot do is you can't just
say, hey, everyone's great.

22
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:22,470
Everyone's a 5.0 that's,
that's,

23
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,690
you're not allowed to do that.
And believe it or not,

24
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:29,610
that's what people would do.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,190
Most people would just have to evaluate
someone. Guess what they say, Hey,

26
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:36,870
you're great.
You do everything great.

27
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,370
And you wouldn't think that the military,

28
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,930
the military would have a hard
time telling people like, hey,

29
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:47,430
here's some areas where
you need to improve.

30
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:51,030
You wouldn't think that the military,
especially like the seal teams,

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,300
you're the big tough seal is going to
have a hard time telling some someone,

32
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,180
hey, this is where your
performances could be better. Right?

33
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,530
But actually no one likes
having those hard conversations.

34
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,100
I shouldn't say just about no one
likes having those hard conversations.

35
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,750
And in fact,

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,780
this is completely evident in the fact
that there was an old evaluation system

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,510
when I first got into the navy and
there you didn't have to force rank,

38
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:23,460
you could just make everyone
perfect basically on paper.

39
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,810
And that's actually what happened.
That system was a 4.0 system.

40
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:32,811
So it was a 4.0 was the highest that you
could get and everyone was a 4.0 guy.

41
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,610
Everyone got four point ohs in everything.

42
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,140
And
actually you have to take that back.

43
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,850
And I think I might've
talked about this before,

44
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,640
but my first evaluation
that I got at a seal team,

45
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,950
I wasn't even in a platoon yet,
but I was going through

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,540
the initial training that
you used to do to seal team.

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,820
When you got to the seal team,
you did something called Stt,

48
00:02:56,821 --> 00:03:00,690
which was stood for seal tactical
training and it basically taught you the,

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,640
is a little bit more advanced
skills than you learned in buds.

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,460
And I got a 4.0 and everything,

51
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:11,461
but I actually got a 3.8 in a
category called human relations.

52
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,970
And I was, I guess, you know,
I talked to my friends though,

53
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,940
we got 4.0 and everything and
everyone got four point except for me,

54
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,140
I got the 3.8 and so then you're
supposed to get a counseling right from,

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,370
and the officer that had written my,

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,260
the officer that had written my evaluation
and giving me all 4.0 4.0 in tactics,

57
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,950
4.0 and that's 4.0 and the other thing.
And then a 3.8 and human relations.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,980
And he had to counsel me cause
that's what you have to do.

59
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,050
You have to go through and
make sure that no one objects.

60
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,550
And he, he looked at me
and he said, you know,

61
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,440
I I give you a 3.8 in,
you know,

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,150
in human relations because well because
I think you're a little too hard on

63
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,280
people that are,
that are unsat.

64
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,490
And I kind of took pride
in that, you know, cause I,

65
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,600
at that time I wasn't really
playing the game. You know,

66
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,790
I kinda was thinking to myself, yeah,
Aye Aye. That's right. You know,

67
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,630
if you're UNSAT I am going to be hard
on you and you can probably guess of the

68
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,560
group that I was in,

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,300
which individual I was harder on than
any one else who was actually that guy.

70
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,720
So that was kind of funny.
But you know, after that,

71
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,880
after I got into a seal platoon then all,
you know,

72
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,510
everything was 4.0 all the time.
And again,

73
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,420
I'm not bragging at all about
that because every single guy,

74
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:38,650
we all had 4.0 it crossed the board on
everything and everyone was the best seal

75
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:41,440
in the seal teams ever in the history
of ever. That's what it was like.

76
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,870
And everyone was this just this, just the
way it was. Everyone was the best soap.

77
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,730
The navy realize this.

78
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Basically the navy realized that all the
leaders were cowards and when it came

79
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:58,990
to telling the truth to the troops about
where they stood and where they can

80
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,120
improve. So they made, they made a change,

81
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:04,300
they made this drastic change to the
evaluation and they changed to this thing

82
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:09,301
called forced ranking where whatever
there was percentages on how many people

83
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:11,890
could be ranked at the highest level,

84
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,010
like it was like 10% of your people can
be ranked at the highest level and then

85
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,190
20% of the next tier and
went on down the line.

86
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:22,930
You didn't actually have to rank someone
as bad but you couldn't rank a bunch of

87
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:25,210
people at the top and

88
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,050
it was,
it actually made a,

89
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:32,500
made a big difference all of a sudden
because now all of a sudden you had to,

90
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,180
if you were in a leadership position,
you had to give your,

91
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,750
some of your people some lower rankings
when you actually had to figure out who

92
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:39,550
is better and

93
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,480
eventually what they did is that again,

94
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,330
people not wanting to
have hard conversations.
Eventually what they did is,

95
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:51,331
because how you advance in the
navy is based on your evaluations,

96
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,660
which is what we're talking about.

97
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,070
But it's also based on how much time
you have in grade. So you can't,

98
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,210
if you make,
if you're an [inaudible],

99
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,580
you can't make a five for three years
or there's some, some random number,

100
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,500
like you cannot make a
five for three years.

101
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,540
And so what they started doing is just
ranking you based on how long you were

102
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,890
there for. And so that's,
that's what they started doing.

103
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,480
So basically it didn't really help

104
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,310
because you still ended up just
saying, oh well you know, you,

105
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,330
you're just new and that's why
you didn't get promoted. Well,

106
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,760
I didn't really understand
that when the first,

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,800
when the very first of the forced
ranking evaluations came out,

108
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,830
I had just made e five and because I
had just made e five I got ranked at the

109
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,330
bottom of the fives in my platoon.

110
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,260
And like I said,

111
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:47,990
at this time I wasn't really
playing the game really fully.

112
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:52,820
So I was Kinda went to my chief
and my and my lieutenant with,

113
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,940
hey, why am I, why am I
at the bottom? W W how,

114
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,080
how can I be the lowest ranking of
the fives because that's just wrong.

115
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,590
What about this guy here? You know,
one of my, this guy over here,

116
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,860
you're telling me that this guy
is doing a better job than I am.

117
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:10,580
Cause I was working really hard and
doing a good job and they didn't disagree

118
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:14,180
with me. What they said. It's like,
look, yes Jocko, you're, you're,

119
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,240
you're definitely doing a better
job than that guy and that guy.

120
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,420
But here's the deal.
They're up for promotion and you're not.

121
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,090
And when you're up for promotion,
you'll be at the top when it's your turn.

122
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,670
And again, I wasn't really playing
the game, so I said, Oh okay,

123
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,200
I get it. Why didn't you just
tell me that were communists?

124
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,820
It was what's going on there. And you
know, there are no, we're not communists.

125
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:40,580
It's just, you know, this is just the way
that the system work. And I said, okay,

126
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:43,370
so what you're telling me is this is
the communist system as well as what's

127
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,280
happening.
Thanks comrade.

128
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,890
And of course they did their
best to explain it to me
and I didn't really listen

129
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,160
because like I said, don't, it wasn't
really playing the game at this time.

130
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,160
I was a young, you know,
e five getting after it,

131
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,720
but eventually it was me that was
evaluating people and force ranking them.

132
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,190
And then it was me that was explaining
the rules of why people got ranked,

133
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,280
where they got ranked and why I
gave him the grades that I gave him.

134
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,750
And of course I did this a bunch from
when I was an assistant platoon commander

135
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,440
and a platoon commander and a task unit
commander. So I had done this a bunch of,

136
00:08:21,441 --> 00:08:25,850
now I was the officer in charge of the
training attachment and I had one of the

137
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:30,800
guys that didn't like where he got
ranked. He, he was, he, he didn't like it.

138
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:35,250
He thought he deserved higher and he,

139
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,160
he thought he deserved a bunch of five
o's that the highest possible grade and

140
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,560
Oh, you know, maybe not on all
the criteria but on some of them.

141
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,790
And he actually requested
on office call with me,

142
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,020
meaning he wanted to come and talk to me,

143
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:52,190
which was kind of weird because at this
time people literally would just walk in

144
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,420
my office all the time and say,
Hey, what's up? I got to, you know,

145
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,230
they were talking about something I was
super casual about people coming to see

146
00:08:58,231 --> 00:08:59,550
me. No, no factor. Right.

147
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,270
So when this guy went and actually
organized an official meeting with me,

148
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,480
I was, you know, I was totally
cool with it, but it was weird.

149
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,880
And he came in and he had his evaluation
with them and he put it on my desk and

150
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,960
you know, he said something
along the lines of, you know,

151
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:21,780
I got ranked in the middle of the pack
and how did this happen and I should be

152
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:25,330
at the top or, or at least I should
be near it and I should have five o's.

153
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:30,060
And in this category and that Cody Gillrie
and this other category and the guy

154
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:34,980
himself, he wasn't a slacker
by any stretch of imagination.
Who was what goods,

155
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,540
really solid seal.

156
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,170
He wasn't like an over the
top outstanding front runner,

157
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,310
but he was really,
really solid,

158
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:49,110
which you only allowed to have a very
small number of guys that you're ranking

159
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,460
as front runners. And he wasn't
there. And you know, I was,

160
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,900
I was better at this point at
playing the game, you know,

161
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:58,980
up and down the chain of command.

162
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,740
And so what I did was I sat there and I
listened to them and I listened to his

163
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,170
perspective.
And as I was doing that,

164
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,630
as I was listening this guy and I
was thinking to myself, you know,

165
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,830
this guy's a hardworking seal.

166
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,460
He thinks he should have
higher grades across the board.

167
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:15,900
He thinks he should be a top
ranked guy with five point ohs.

168
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,230
And as I'm sitting there listening to him,
I'm thinking,

169
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,420
why does he actually think that?
Why does he think that? What?

170
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:28,050
What is going on in his head that
he thinks that he should be a 5.0

171
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,920
and of course I'm thinking to myself,
this is somehow my fault.

172
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,980
This has gotta be my fault because
I'm the leader and I have a guy,

173
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,670
I have a guy that's concerned enough
about his rankings that he's in here

174
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,540
talking to me. He actually
set an appointment to come
and talk to me about this.

175
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,720
So obviously I have not done a good job
at this point of explaining things to

176
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,490
him. And if I'm, if I'm,
if he doesn't get it,

177
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:58,380
obviously there's gonna be more
people that, that think the same way,

178
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,660
then you know, he's not the only one
when someone comes to the problem,

179
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:03,200
they're not the only one. So that's
what I'm thinking and I'm, um,

180
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,280
I'm thinking that he's thinking he's
a 5.0 that's what he's thinking.

181
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:12,060
He's thinking he's a 5.0
and he's not,

182
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,500
and he thinks he should be.
And then I'm trying to figure out,

183
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:17,490
I'm thinking to myself,
okay,

184
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:22,491
how do I explain to him
where he is missing the mark?

185
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,070
How can I explain to him that he's not
quite a 5.0 because 5.0 is outstanding

186
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,090
and then the answer kind
of jumped out at me.

187
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:40,890
The answer was the evaluation form itself.

188
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,550
That's,

189
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,550
that's what it was because the
evaluation form itself actually gives the

190
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:53,631
definition of what a 5.0
sailor is what a 5.0 liter is.

191
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,410
And really when you break it down to
what a 5.0 human being is the evaluation

192
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,240
actually spells it out

193
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
in plain English.

194
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:08,380
So I picked up the evaluation form that
he had brought in and I started to read

195
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,940
chunks of it to him.

196
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,230
So the first little chunk
that I read to read to him,

197
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,030
there's a section called
professional knowledge and,

198
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,490
and if you are a 5.0 in
professional knowledge,

199
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,160
it gives you a list of what you are.
And here's what it says.

200
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,590
If you're a five point on professional
knowledge, this is what it says,

201
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,260
recognized expert,

202
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,420
sought out by all for technical knowledge,

203
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,530
uses knowledge to solve
complex technical problems,

204
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,530
meets advancement requirements
early and with distinction.

205
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,150
So you know, I looked at him and
said, okay, recognized expert.

206
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,240
Are you a recognized expert?

207
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,560
Does how often are you getting called
by the east coast or by the seal team to

208
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,180
help them solve a problem? The answer
was he's not. He's a good solid guy,

209
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,520
really good instructor,
but he's not a,

210
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
he's not a recognized
expert and he knew it.

211
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,660
And then I read the the 3.0 which
is a middle grade. Like, Hey,

212
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:21,810
this is your average situation. I said,
maybe this is you. I said, listen,

213
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,930
strong working knowledge
of rating specialty and job
reliably applies knowledge

214
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:33,270
to accomplish tasks,
meets advancement requirements on time.

215
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,750
This is a solid human being,
right? This is a solid, that's a,

216
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,940
that's a 3.0 right there. And again, as
I'm reading through this, this guy, yeah,

217
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,010
he had strong working knowledge for sure.

218
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,990
He was applying that knowledge to
his job for sure. He was doing that.

219
00:13:48,991 --> 00:13:50,880
So that's cool.
That's 3.0

220
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,010
what about quality of work?
Another section, quality of work.

221
00:13:56,011 --> 00:14:00,000
Here's a 5.0 for quality of work needs.
No supervision.

222
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,410
Always produces exceptional work.

223
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,390
No rework required maximizes resources,

224
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,040
so need to know resources.
Let's think about that. I mean,

225
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,630
this guy was working
in another department.

226
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:20,631
He was definitely being managed and
then always produces exceptional work.

227
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,050
Again, this is as good can it
get any better than exceptional?

228
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,223
Hmm.

229
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,660
So I said,
is that you?

230
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,090
Do you not need any supervision?
And he knew. I mean,

231
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,980
I know I worked in the departments. I know
what's going on. He, he's not going to,

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,260
you can't lie to me. And I said, how
about this needs little supervision,

233
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,090
produces quality work. Few errors,
uses resources efficiently.

234
00:14:48,091 --> 00:14:49,690
You know what that is?
That's 3.0 hmm.

235
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,070
I actually gave you a 4.0
somewhere in between those two.

236
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,470
I'm actually being kind of generous.
What do you think?

237
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,740
How about military bearing and character
with, let's see what that looks like.

238
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,390
Here's what,
here's what,

239
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,190
here's what the definition for military
bearing and characterised us navy 5.0

240
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,760
evaluation.
Exemplary personal appearance,

241
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,680
model of conduct,
conduct on and off duty.

242
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,970
A leader in physical readiness
exemplifies navy core values.

243
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,780
Honor, courage, commitment. Now,

244
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:30,860
this guy is sitting in my office,
he's in sloppy PT gear.

245
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,270
His hair's a little bit long and he's not,
he's not one of these superstud seals.

246
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,530
That's an awesome physical shape.

247
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:39,590
He's kind of a guy that liked to party
a bit and he was a hardworking seal.

248
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,060
A great guy. But I'm saying
he wasn't exactly a model
of conduct on and off duty.

249
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,940
Think about what that means.
A model of conduct.

250
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,200
So that's 5.0 then I said, listen,
let me tell you what I tell them,

251
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,430
but let me tell you what 3.0 is excellent.
Personal appearance, excellent conduct,

252
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,550
conscientiously complies with regulations,

253
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:03,290
complies with physical readiness program,
lives up to navy core values, honor,

254
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:06,920
courage, commitment. That that to me,

255
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,060
you know you're a pretty squared away guy,
but how'd you do on that last PT test?

256
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,280
Right? Cause you, you didn't knock it
out of the park. I know that. Right?

257
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,510
So you are you telling him?
Yes, you're reading, reading.

258
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,020
I'm just doing what
we're doing right here.

259
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,310
I'm straight up reading
them to them cause cause

260
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:29,750
it was really obvious that
these standards are very,

261
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,860
very high.

262
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,800
And you know also here's the
bottom of the barrel. Okay,

263
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:41,801
this is 1.0 1.04 for values or for
military bearing and character.

264
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:49,430
This is 1.0 consistently.
Unsatisfactorily appearance,

265
00:16:49,431 --> 00:16:52,460
poor self control conduct
resulting in disciplinary action,

266
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,510
unable to meet one or more physical
readiness requirements fails to live up to

267
00:16:56,511 --> 00:16:59,200
one or more navy core values.
Honor, courage, commitment. So,

268
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,800
so this guy clearly is not a 1.0 that's
a, that's a horse. Know that's a,

269
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,490
that's a bad sailor. But this
guy's solid. He's in the middle.

270
00:17:07,491 --> 00:17:10,670
I think I had him with a four point.
I said Aye. Aye. We good with a foro

271
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,220
or you going to tell me that you crushed
that you were the leader of the pack on

272
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,690
the last PT test that we did.

273
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,940
You know w when you tell me were you the,
were you the 5.0 no.

274
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,610
Couldn't honestly say it.
And by now he kind of,

275
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:30,770
he kind of got the message that he's
no 1.0 but he definitely wasn't a 5.0

276
00:17:30,771 --> 00:17:31,760
either.
And,

277
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:36,761
and clearly what I realize is he
never actually read through what those

278
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,070
standards were.

279
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,280
And clearly that was my fault for not
making sure that this guy and the rest of

280
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:51,090
the people at my command understood
what the grading criteria was.

281
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:55,260
And I started to try and do that and
I started to realize that the grading

282
00:17:55,261 --> 00:18:00,261
criteria was actually solid and it was a
good guide to being a really good seal,

283
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,830
a really good sailor,
a really good person.

284
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,900
And as you read through
some of these 5.0 qualities,

285
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:15,901
here's the one for command organizational
climate slash equal opportunity.

286
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,780
So if you're, this is your, if
you're a five oh in this category,

287
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,920
measurably contributes to the navy's,
increased retention and reduced attrition.

288
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:25,900
Objective,
proactive leader,

289
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:30,160
exemplary mentor involved in subordinates,
personal development,

290
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:33,100
leading to professional growth
and sustained commitment,

291
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,710
initiate support programs for military,

292
00:18:35,711 --> 00:18:39,250
civilian and families to
achieve exceptional command
and organizational climate.

293
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,490
The model of achievement develops unit
cohesion by valuing differences as

294
00:18:45,551 --> 00:18:49,780
strengths. So let's think about
that. That's, that's a massive,

295
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:53,530
who's going to get five? Oh, in that,
in the seal teams, not too many people.

296
00:18:53,531 --> 00:18:57,740
Because in the seal teams who's
initiating support programs means you're

297
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,930
actively starting a program to help
support, right? There's not a lot of guys,

298
00:19:01,931 --> 00:19:05,890
they're going to hit 5.0 and that's
the way it should be. Here's what,

299
00:19:05,891 --> 00:19:10,510
5.0 it looks like for personal
job accomplishment and initiative,

300
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,110
energetic self starter completes tasks
or qualifications early far better than

301
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,880
expected.
So you're not just doing,

302
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,520
you're doing it early and it's still
even better than everyone else.

303
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,320
Plans and prioritizes wisely and with
exceptional foresight seeks extra

304
00:19:26,321 --> 00:19:28,690
responsibility and takes
on the hardest jobs.

305
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,750
That's 5.0 here's the,
here's the five bullet 0.0 for teamwork.

306
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,320
Team builder inspires cooperation
and progress, focuses,

307
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:42,910
goals and techniques for teams the
best at accepting and offering team

308
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:46,420
direction. That's a team
player. That's teamwork.

309
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,370
And here's, here's the, here's
how you get a 5.0 in leadership.

310
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,880
Now think about this.
You think you're a good seal,

311
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,750
you think you're a good sailor and you
think I'm, I'm a good leader, right?

312
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:04,530
Here's what you have to do to get a
5.0 inspiring motivator and trainer.

313
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:08,380
Subordinates reach highest
level of growth and development.

314
00:20:08,381 --> 00:20:09,940
So now all of a sudden,
not even about you anymore.

315
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,330
It's about you being a leader
and you not just what you do,

316
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,380
but what your subordinates,

317
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:17,290
your subordinates have to reach the
highest level of growth and development.

318
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,660
It goes on.
Superb organizer.

319
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,790
Great foresight develops process
improvements and efficiencies,

320
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,730
leadership achievements,
Dr. Leadership at treatment,

321
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,400
dramatically further command,
mission and vision.

322
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,690
So what you do as a leader
dramatically furthers the mission.

323
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:36,630
Okay?

324
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:41,130
Perseveres through the toughest
challenges and inspires other others.

325
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,750
Exceptional communicator.

326
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,660
How many people did you know that
are exceptional communicators?

327
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,030
There's not a lot of
people that are exceptional
commuters. That's a hard thing.

328
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:52,750
That's not only being born
with some communication skills,

329
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,830
it's actively working and honing
those skills through your lifetime.

330
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,860
Before someone tells you you're
an exceptional communicator.

331
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,130
Make subordinate safety conscience
maintains top safety record constantly

332
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,300
improves the personal and professional
lives of others. So this is,

333
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:14,140
this is barely even about you anymore.
It's how well, how well does your team do?

334
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,870
So you've got to be 100% squared away if
you're going to get a 5.0 in leadership.

335
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,480
That's just the way it
is. And, and like I said,

336
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,360
you're not just getting judged on
your success, but on the success,

337
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,320
not just of the mission, but of the actual
individual people that work for you.

338
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,120
And so this,

339
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,040
this granular look at these descriptions
kind of changed this guy's perspective

340
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,690
and it now he actually saw what he was
supposed to be doing and he actually knew

341
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,320
what he was aiming at and
he didn't know that before.

342
00:21:52,321 --> 00:21:55,470
And you know who's fault it is that he
didn't know that it's my fault because

343
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm the guy that's in charge and I thought
everyone knew or I thought at least

344
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,130
everyone was aiming as high as
they possibly good at everything.

345
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,140
But that's actually naive.
It's naive for a couple reasons.

346
00:22:07,141 --> 00:22:10,260
Not only is not everyone aiming to
be the best they can, I don't know.

347
00:22:10,261 --> 00:22:11,580
Some people don't care about some things,

348
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,850
but sometimes people don't
actually understand what
it is that they're supposed

349
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:17,910
to be aiming at.
They don't understand what the metric is,

350
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,080
how they're being measured,

351
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,320
and clearly you have to have something
to aim at and if you don't have anything

352
00:22:28,751 --> 00:22:31,310
to aim at, then you're never going to
get anywhere. You're never going to be,

353
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,760
you're never going to hit the
target that's you're not aiming at.

354
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,470
You have to aim at the target to hit it.

355
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,350
You have to know what you are
trying to be or you won't be that.

356
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,300
And the navy,
I think with this evaluation form

357
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:51,240
does a decent job. If you kind of can take
a step back and one problems with the,

358
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,870
with the navy evaluation system and all
the evaluation systems in the military

359
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:58,860
is they're very administrative.
It's,

360
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:03,060
it turns into more much more of a
paperwork drill than it is an actual,

361
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,260
an actual attempt to make people
improve themselves. Right.

362
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,850
It's there, but people go all go to
FAU. This is where I fell out. Cool.

363
00:23:11,851 --> 00:23:15,480
I'm a promotion called man. They don't
read it. Yeah, right. They don't actually,

364
00:23:15,481 --> 00:23:15,841
it's not,

365
00:23:15,841 --> 00:23:20,841
it's not a true counseling up to the
objective isn't to really truly improve

366
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:24,420
those people. That's one of the
problems with this, with the,

367
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,840
with the counseling system inside the
navy and it happens in the other branches

368
00:23:27,841 --> 00:23:31,620
as well. But, but if you read that
sheet and you kind of take a look at it,

369
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:36,150
then you realize, okay, there's
some things that I can aim at now.

370
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,390
And the navy does a decent job of that.
I'll tell you,

371
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,910
the Marine Corps does an even better job.

372
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,640
The United States Corp evaluation
system is more detailed and it's more

373
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,780
descriptive and it's more complete.

374
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:53,690
The navy system than the whole
navy evaluation is two pages long.

375
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,740
The Marine Corps,
there's is six pages long.

376
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,020
And one thing that's interesting
about the marine corps, you know, in,

377
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,730
in the navy one they list,
okay,

378
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:08,750
you're a 1.0 this is what you're like
as a 1.0 the marine corps doesn't even

379
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,600
give description for the low end of the
spectrum. They did. They don't even,

380
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,980
they don't even exist.

381
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,550
They're not going to waste
time describing a loser marine.

382
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,340
They have a higher minimum
standard basically. But

383
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,890
this is one thing that struck me the
first time I kind of noticed the Marine

384
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,060
Corp evaluation system cause it's,

385
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,930
it's an administrative thing so it's not
like I would see it on a regular basis.

386
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,881
When I was in Ramadi,

387
00:24:34,881 --> 00:24:39,881
I was in the brigade tactical operation
center and I was probably there for a

388
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:44,510
meeting with the brigade
commander or whatever and was
there for whatever reason.

389
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,720
And one of the marine officers was in
there who I knew and we were kind of

390
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:52,721
talking and he was filling out one of
an evaluation for one of his guys and he

391
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,400
was on the back page of his evaluation.

392
00:24:55,401 --> 00:24:58,940
And I was just being nosy I guess looking
at looking at what it was like looking

393
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:01,070
at what their system was like,
comparing it to our system.

394
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,660
And as I was looking at
the form on the last page,

395
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,010
the page he was actually working on there,

396
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:12,030
whereas a graphic representation of of
marines and of how they rank marines and

397
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,390
it kind of looked like a Christmas tree.

398
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:21,230
So if you picture a Christmas tree and
the whole Christmas tree is made up of

399
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:24,320
Little Eagle Globe and anchor,
which is the symbol of the Marine Corps.

400
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,510
And so there's a bunch of Little Eagle
Globe and anchors and they're all

401
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,080
positioned on this piece of paper
and it looks like a Christmas tree.

402
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:38,810
And so the, the bottom, the actually
the, the bottom of this graphic,

403
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:41,540
the bottom of this Christmas tree is just
an empty space. There's nothing there.

404
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,670
And,
and that line is representative.

405
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:46,640
There's a little indicator that
shows what that line represents.

406
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:49,130
That line represents
the unqualified marine.

407
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,670
So there should be no
unqualified marines in your unit.

408
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,720
And then it goes up one level and now
you've just got one single Eagle Globe and

409
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:03,230
anchor representing one
marine. And, and this, this is,

410
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:08,290
it looks like the trunk of the Christmas
tree and that that line is labeled a

411
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:13,850
qualified marine. So now you've got
one guy, you know, percentage wise,

412
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:18,851
one person that is simply
just a qualified marine there.

413
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:24,530
He's qualified but there's not,
this shouldn't be that many of them.

414
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,190
And then they'd go, now he picked
her Christmas tree above the trunk.

415
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:31,310
Now it's a big wide area and that's
where they go to this next level,

416
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
which has the most,

417
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:40,180
it's like the middle third
of the Christmas tree and
that area they labeled that

418
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:43,004
area.

419
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,620
One of the many highly
qualified professionals who
form the majority of this

420
00:26:50,801 --> 00:26:51,310
grade.

421
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:56,310
So the biggest chunk of people is sort
of in the middle third of this Christmas

422
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:59,080
tree. And that's what it is.
Hey, that's what most of,

423
00:26:59,081 --> 00:27:02,530
that's where most of the guys are.
There's Holly highly qualified people.

424
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,590
They make up the most of this
group of that that I'm evaluating.

425
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,833
And there they are.

426
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,520
And then above that third
on this Christmas tree is a,

427
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,440
now the Christmas tree is getting smaller,
right?

428
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:19,441
So now we're getting into a narrow group
in this narrow group is labeled and

429
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,450
it's called Sophie.
You're in this group,

430
00:27:23,451 --> 00:27:28,451
you're being labeled as one of the
few exceptionally qualified marines.

431
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,600
And that again, that's a much smaller
number than that middle group.

432
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,990
And then you get to the top
of the Christmas tree where
there is a single eagle

433
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:46,810
globe and anchor representing
the very best of this group.

434
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,640
And it's up there alone
at the pinnacle of performance.

435
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:58,150
And there's a label for this singular
marine at the top of his group.

436
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,730
And the label says the
eminently qualified marine.

437
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,420
And I remember when I read that,

438
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,640
when I read those words,
the eminently qualified marine

439
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:24,780
and I, I thought to myself,
that is the ultimate praise.

440
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:32,370
And that's pretty much how the
Marine Corp evaluation ends.

441
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:37,850
And it ends in this epic way
because it is, it is an I,

442
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:42,010
I,
it's weird to say this,

443
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:46,270
it's an epic document. It's
an epic, epic document.

444
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,870
And I want to talk about this document
today and I want to start off by,

445
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,020
by the way,
that the document itself starts off.

446
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,890
So this is the Marine Corps fitness
report. This is how they grade marines.

447
00:28:56,891 --> 00:28:59,200
And it starts off with
the commandant's guidance.

448
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,100
So the first thing they'd get his guidance
from the most senior marine in the

449
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,933
Marine Corps

450
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,210
and the commandant's guidance says the
completed fitness report is the most

451
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:12,300
important information component
in manpower management.

452
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,160
It is the primary means of evaluating
a marine's performance and is the

453
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:20,490
commandant's primary tool for the
selection of personnel for promotion,

454
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:25,200
augmentation, resident schooling,
command and duty assignments. Therefore,

455
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,280
the completion of this report is
one of an officer's most critical

456
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,310
responsibilities inherent in this duty
as the commitment of each reporting

457
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:39,441
senior and reviewing officer to ensure
the integrity of the system by giving

458
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,940
close attention to accurate
marking and timely reporting.

459
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,540
Every officer serves a role in the
scrupulous maintenance of this evaluation

460
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:54,010
system. Ultimately important to both
the individual and the Marine Corps.

461
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:01,140
Inflationary markings only serve to
dilute the actual value of each report.

462
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,040
Reviewing officers will not
concur with inflated reports.

463
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,800
So out of the gate we're
getting put in check.

464
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:14,820
Do not come here telling everyone
they're great. That's not,

465
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:19,080
that's not gonna fly where we're
rejecting that outright from the start.

466
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Now we start the evaluation and again
this is set up a little bit similar to the

467
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,640
navy and they start breaking out what
your performance is based on the first

468
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:33,960
thing that it's based on his mission,
accomplishment

469
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,130
and mission accomplishment.
They break into two things.

470
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,240
The first thing is performance.

471
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,910
So here's what it says about
performance of mission accomplishment,

472
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,080
accomplishment, results achieved
during the reporting period,

473
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,090
how well those duties inherent to a
marine's billet plus all additional duties

474
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,180
formally and informally assigned work
carried out reflects a marine's aptitude,

475
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,590
competence and commitment to the
unit success above personal reward

476
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,870
indicators,
our time and resource management task,

477
00:31:07,871 --> 00:31:12,871
prioritization and tenacity to
achieve positive ends consistently.

478
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,540
So the low end it says meets requirements
of billet and additional duties,

479
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:25,460
aptitude, commitment and competence.
Meet expectations, results,

480
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,570
maintain status quo so that
as you're doing your job,

481
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,073
okay.

482
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,290
And then if you're at the
high end of the spectrum,

483
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,010
results far surpass expectations,

484
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,560
recognizes and exploits new
resources creates opportunities,

485
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,730
emulated,

486
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:49,910
sought after as an expert with
influence beyond unit impact,

487
00:31:50,221 --> 00:31:54,750
significant innovative approaches to
problems produce significant gains in

488
00:31:54,751 --> 00:31:56,010
quality and efficiency.

489
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,810
If you just take that single bullet
and that's what you try and achieve,

490
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,090
you're smoking, you're
crushing you. I want to,

491
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:10,230
you have someone like that working for
you and you're in heaven because this guy

492
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:14,850
is going to make things happen.
Next up.

493
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:18,060
Proficiency demonstrates technical
knowledge and practical skill and the

494
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:22,050
execution of the marines.
Overall duties combines training,

495
00:32:22,051 --> 00:32:27,051
education and experience translates
skills into actions which contribute to

496
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:31,530
accomplishing tasks and missions
imparts knowledge to others.

497
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,810
Think about this one translates
skills and actions. That's it.

498
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:40,280
That's kind of a big deal.
How many people have skills,

499
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:43,790
but they can't translate them in actions?
Thinking about that your life. Hey,

500
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:46,640
you got some skills, but you don't
use them. You can't put them anywhere.

501
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:50,630
You can't put them into a fact.
Here's the middle grade for proficiency.

502
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,130
Demonstrates mastery of all required
skills. So if you've mastered your skills,

503
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:58,760
you're still just like in the
middle. Expertise, education,

504
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:01,760
and experience consistently
enhance mission, accomplishment,

505
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:07,070
innovative troubleshooter and problem
solver effectively impart skills to

506
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:07,904
subordinates.

507
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,020
These are the kinds of things where if
you load that you're supposed to impart

508
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,810
skills to your subordinates. You pay
attention to it, you start doing it,

509
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,230
but you might not recognize
that that's part of your job.

510
00:33:18,231 --> 00:33:21,770
That's part of your life. Here's what
it sounds like if you're an expert.

511
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,890
True expert in field knowledge and
skills impact far beyond those of peers,

512
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,780
translates broad based education and
experience into forward thinking.

513
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,990
Innovative actions make a measurable
impact on mission accomplishment.

514
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,060
Peerless teacher selflessly imparts
expertise to subordinates, peers,

515
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:47,450
and seniors.
Think about that.

516
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,310
That is a high bar man. That
is a high bar. You could work,

517
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,840
you could work diligently every single
day and fall short of that. Yeah,

518
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:58,251
but let me tell you,

519
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:00,740
it's important that you know that you
should be working towards it. Yeah.

520
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:07,820
Next section.
Individual character.

521
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:12,470
Isn't it legit? When you're going
to grade someone on their character,

522
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,910
this is outstanding.
This is outstanding.

523
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,670
How many people are not thinking
about what their character is,

524
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
how many people are not actively minding
the way that their actions reflect

525
00:34:25,201 --> 00:34:27,720
their character happens all the time.
Oh yeah.

526
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,230
If we were thinking about if you
knew you're getting graded on it,

527
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:35,000
maybe you wouldn't take those,
those base actions. Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,130
Kind of like goes along with
like how you said that one time,

529
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:39,380
like imagine someone's videotaping,
you know,

530
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:42,290
and they're going to do the
playback. It's like, man, if you go,

531
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,460
if you have that in the back
of your mind yet you act.

532
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,460
That's the first step though,
because the actual,

533
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,340
that's the first step because
you might think, well,

534
00:34:49,341 --> 00:34:51,230
I'm being videoed but this
is what I'm expected to do.

535
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,300
So you might be doing
something that's not correct.

536
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:58,790
You might be off chart. You might
be aiming at the wrong thing. Hey,

537
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,700
I'm acting like a tough
guy. I want everyone to know
that I'm tough. You realize,

538
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:04,910
oh, that's actually stupid.
Yeah. So you can be,

539
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,250
you can have in your mind that
I'm going to keep my character,

540
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:10,850
but you're wrong because you might
be aiming at the wrong thing.

541
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,750
So this gives you some pretty
specific things to aim at.

542
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,710
Topic number one,
core courage,

543
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,600
moral or physical strength to overcome
danger, fear, difficulty or anxiety.

544
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,240
Personal acceptance of
responsibility and accountability.

545
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:30,710
Placing conscience over competing
interests regardless of consequences.

546
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,093
Okay.

547
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,680
Conscious, overriding decision, risk,

548
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:41,430
bodily harm or death to accomplish
the mission or save others,

549
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,640
the will to persevere despite uncertainty.

550
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,520
What if you're thinking about the fact
that you're getting graded on your will

551
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,750
to persevere despite uncertainty?
You think about that every day.

552
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,450
You don't know what your future holds,
but you're going to persevere regardless.

553
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,920
Think if you're getting
graded on that every day. Hmm.

554
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:08,880
Here's what the bottom end of the
spectrum is. Demonstrates inner strength.

555
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,750
So at the minimum,

556
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:13,890
you're demonstrating inner strength
and acceptance of responsibility

557
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,770
commensurate with the scope
of duties and experience,

558
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:20,760
willing to face moral of physical danger
in pursuit of mission accomplishment.

559
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,420
So even at the low end of the spectrum,
you're still willing to face danger.

560
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,400
Moral or physical challenges.

561
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,810
Here's the middle.
Guided by conscious in all actions,

562
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,620
proven ability, proven ability
to overcome danger, fear,

563
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,640
difficulty or anxiety exhibits bravery
in the face of adversity and certainty,

564
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,200
not deterred by moral
difficult situations,

565
00:36:46,201 --> 00:36:48,810
morally difficult situations
or has miss responsibilities.

566
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,990
How often are people deterred
by difficult situations,

567
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,600
daily, morally, morally
difficult situations?

568
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,130
Here's at the top,
the top of the spectrum for courage,

569
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,520
uncommon bravery and capacity to overcome
obstacles and inspire others in the

570
00:37:11,281 --> 00:37:15,620
face of moral dilemma or life
threatening danger but not.

571
00:37:15,621 --> 00:37:18,270
It's not even just about you.
You have to actually take it to level.

572
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:23,040
We're inspiring others demonstrated
under the most adverse conditions.

573
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,300
Selfless

574
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,580
always places conscience over competing
interest regardless of physical or

575
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:35,520
personal consequences.
That's a competition.

576
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,800
We talked about the competition between,
oh,

577
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:39,960
I'm going to take care of myself and
I'm going to take care of the team.

578
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:44,070
I'm going to take care of the mission
between what's doing what's right to do

579
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,830
instead of what is easy to do.

580
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:53,130
The next section that you get graded
on your individual character is

581
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:54,930
effectiveness under stress.

582
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,430
This is just outstanding because there's
not thinking about this and you don't

583
00:38:00,431 --> 00:38:01,630
even see this in in business.

584
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:04,570
I don't see this and when people
evaluate other in the business world,

585
00:38:04,571 --> 00:38:07,300
but there is stress in business
world is a different kind of stress,

586
00:38:07,301 --> 00:38:11,530
but it's stress. Here's effectiveness
under stress. Here's what you're doing.

587
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,221
Thinking,

588
00:38:12,221 --> 00:38:16,390
functioning and leading effectively under
conditions of physical and or mental

589
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:17,224
pressure.

590
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:21,790
Maintaining composure appropriate for
the situation while displaying steady

591
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:22,900
purpose of action,

592
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,550
enabling one to inspire others while
continuing to lead under adverse

593
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:30,730
conditions.
Physical and emotional strength.

594
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,000
Resilience and endurance are elements.

595
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:40,720
Low End of the spectrum. Exhibits
discipline and stability under pressure,

596
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,050
judgment and effective problem
solving skills are evident.

597
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,620
Just the low end of the spectrum. By
the way, how many people do you think,

598
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:52,360
do you know that don't exhibit
any discipline or stability
under pressure, right?

599
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,960
There's all kinds of people.
Yeah,

600
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:58,900
there's all kinds of people and we
know when's the last time you you,

601
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,380
you didn't do a good job under pressure?
Probably this morning.

602
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,720
It happens, right? Fully write comments,

603
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,470
especially when you're
not thinking about it,

604
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,700
especially when you're not aimed at
the correct response to pressure. Yeah.

605
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:16,450
Especially when you haven't
put a standard in your mind.

606
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,140
Remember when you used to kind of
freak out in Jujitsu when you got

607
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,850
claustrophobic, right? Sure.
Yeah. Right? Sure. You get,

608
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,840
you'd get in a position. Yes, sir.
Yeah. Usually side control. Right.

609
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,830
You didn't like that. The pressure on
the neck, the pressure on the chest.

610
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,460
There were more circumstances
surrounding those, you know, scenario.

611
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:41,380
Does she has a mental and moral problems?
Yeah, it would have to. Yeah. Okay. Yes,

612
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:45,010
I do remember that. At some point
you said to yourself, all right,

613
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,460
I cannot act that way
anymore. Yeah. You made a,

614
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:52,990
you set a bar for yourself.
Yes, sir. That's the beginning
of solving the problem.

615
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,110
That's what I love about this.

616
00:39:56,470 --> 00:40:00,400
It's actually setting a bar
of when you're under stress,

617
00:40:00,401 --> 00:40:03,490
this is how you got to act if you're,

618
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:07,300
if you're a little above average
for effectiveness under stress,

619
00:40:07,301 --> 00:40:10,540
here's where you're at.
Consistently demonstrates maturity,

620
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:15,570
mental agility and willpower
during periods of adversity
provides order to chaos

621
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:21,040
through the application of intuition,
problem solving skills and leadership.

622
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,040
Composure reassures other,

623
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,450
imagine you are on a team
and this is the average guy.

624
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,810
This is just so impressive.

625
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:36,310
But my point is unless you
tell your guys what average is,

626
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,610
they won't know it. Yeah,
they don't understand it.

627
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,410
Here's the high end. So this is when
you look at your troops and you say,

628
00:40:44,411 --> 00:40:48,280
this is what I want you to do. When we
come under massive amounts of stress.

629
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Here's the model I want you to
try and perform as demonstrates.

630
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,360
Sell the matched presence of mind
under the most demanding circumstances

631
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,140
stabilizes any situation through the
resolute and timely application of

632
00:41:04,841 --> 00:41:09,280
direction, focus and
personal presence. Now,

633
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,971
what I was doing this,

634
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:12,910
I was actually only gonna read the high
end when I was thinking about this,

635
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:18,010
but then I realized each one of these
built and that person at the high end

636
00:41:18,011 --> 00:41:19,030
already has the other two.

637
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,000
But there's other elements in there
that aren't mentioned in the high end.

638
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,610
So you've got to mention me and you
assume when someone's on the high end,

639
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:28,100
they got those. Obviously they got the
lower end things wrapped up, right?

640
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:32,020
So you got to combine all these
three together, the low grade,

641
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,200
the middle grade in the high grade.

642
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,390
We want people to show initiative.
Talk about this all the time.

643
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:41,630
This is the essence of decentralized
command, is that people show initiative.

644
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:46,340
Here's what they say about initiative
action in the absence of specific

645
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:47,174
direction,

646
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,280
seeing what needs to be done and
acting without prompting. Hmm.

647
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,010
So I'm listening to all, all of these,
this whole thing. And at first I was like,

648
00:41:58,011 --> 00:41:58,611
oh,
that's cool.

649
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:02,480
That's how the navy kind of evaluate
the people and sure you're going to talk

650
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:03,500
about the marines and stuff,

651
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,210
but maybe like the second
little part you started reading,

652
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:12,590
I just started applying it to myself.
That's what I'm saying, like my life.

653
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,070
Okay. So you know, we're, we're all part
of that. Like, if you have a family,

654
00:42:16,071 --> 00:42:18,870
if you're at the dad or something,
right, or your whatever, if you,

655
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:23,390
if you're in a family unit,
you're part of a team right there.

656
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:27,230
And you know your goals change from time
to time, but you sorta know the goals.

657
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:32,480
So I'm like thinking in my mind every
little like element that you're talking

658
00:42:32,481 --> 00:42:35,960
about, I'm like, okay, let me
evaluate myself for sure with this.

659
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:39,080
Like how good and you're right, man. So a
lot of times, a lot of times like, okay,

660
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:42,090
so performing under under stress,
right?

661
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,660
Like there's all these little things.

662
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:46,590
You're going to the beach and
you're trying to make it on

663
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:53,210
the house and make it the beach.
We have a high stress level.

664
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,980
The kids need their water and
they need their change of clothes.

665
00:42:57,981 --> 00:42:59,750
It might get cold,
they need to Jackie and all this stuff.

666
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,620
Meanwhile the clock is
ticking, you know, daylight.

667
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,670
You could go on and miss
sunset, all the stuff. Um,

668
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,060
so how are you going to perform under
that stress? You know, and I get it.

669
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,180
The funny thing is you're, you're
bringing up this, you're bringing up this,

670
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:17,720
and I'm actually completely making fun
of you for bringing up that stress.

671
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,960
How often are you at a public place and
you see a family and they're running

672
00:43:23,121 --> 00:43:26,180
late or whatever,
and you see a leader of the family,

673
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:30,950
mother or father freaking out and losing
their composure over the stress that we

674
00:43:30,951 --> 00:43:34,040
were actually joking about. Yeah, you're
a little bit serious. I'm joking about it.

675
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:39,100
But still you see people lose
their minds because of dumb things.

676
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,510
Oh yeah.
And it,

677
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,990
there's a little bit of stress in
their world and they dropped the ball.

678
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:49,370
They freak out. Farm. Exactly. So
my question is, do those people,

679
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,180
has anyone ever sat them down and explain
to them what the standard is? Yes sir.

680
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,040
And that's my point here. Yeah. A lot
of times people don't even recognize,

681
00:43:58,041 --> 00:43:59,840
they don't even know.
They don't even understand what,

682
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,550
what the eminently qualified human being,

683
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,620
how they are going to act in these
situations. Yeah. It totally, totally,

684
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:12,380
exactly 100% right there. So like, okay,

685
00:44:12,381 --> 00:44:17,381
so you know how he ever have a guy who
like loses his temper and then like you

686
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:18,831
say,
hey,

687
00:44:18,831 --> 00:44:22,280
you kind of lost it there and then he
goes back to how he felt like almost like

688
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:26,650
the way he felt justified. Right. So you
just understand, here's the thing Brad,

689
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,810
we know you felt like that.
You totally demonstrates.

690
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:32,190
So you don't have to explain
that. But yeah, you were feeling

691
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,930
this and you behaved a certain way.

692
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,850
But if that guy knew that he was
being evaluated on his behavior,

693
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,500
regardless of how he feels, but he, he'd
be aiming how you put and that's it.

694
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,330
It's not, it's not just the
grading part. Yes, it's,

695
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,360
you have to know what the standard is
because that guy that might not even

696
00:44:54,031 --> 00:44:57,640
understand, hey, if I lose my
temper, it's, I think it was either,

697
00:44:58,110 --> 00:44:59,160
I think it was JP.

698
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,640
Jp really took it to heart when he
heard me say losing your temper is a

699
00:45:05,581 --> 00:45:08,160
weakness. The for that.
He just didn't, you know,

700
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:11,040
because you see other people in
your life and see other team guys,

701
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,731
you see your dad,

702
00:45:11,731 --> 00:45:16,080
you see your uncle and they fly off the
handle and you almost have a respect for

703
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:19,230
it, right? You definitely respect your,
when your dad loses your temporary,

704
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:22,740
you kind of think, wow, that's powerful.
How can I have some of that power?

705
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:25,530
While you just do that,
it's a learned mechanism.

706
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,770
And then eventually you realize
or someone tells you, Hey,

707
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,320
when you lose your temper, you're
not in control. And matter of fact,

708
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,680
you're not controlling all and whatever
made you lose your temper is controlling

709
00:45:34,681 --> 00:45:37,860
you. And losing your
temper is, is a weakness.

710
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,090
And so that's the big difference. It's
not just, hey, you're being graded,

711
00:45:42,091 --> 00:45:45,090
you're being watched, which is
definitely a great mindset to have,

712
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:49,650
but you have to understand
what the parameters are that
you're being measured by,

713
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:54,180
that you're being graded on.
And that's where this comes into play.

714
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,110
The next section,
I'd just started with initiative

715
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,400
and we want subordinates
to take initiative,

716
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,670
but we want everyone to take
initiative, right? Or your kids.

717
00:46:05,671 --> 00:46:08,750
You want your kids to take initiative.
You want people in your, if you want to,

718
00:46:08,751 --> 00:46:10,020
everyone to take initiative.

719
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,040
I used to say to the young seal platoon
commanders and tasking your cleaners,

720
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:16,130
I would say imagine if everyone of your,
everyone,

721
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,480
your fire team leaders just
was doing something smart.

722
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,160
They just took initiative
and made it happen.

723
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,110
Your job becomes so easy because you
don't have to control everything.

724
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:27,180
Everyone's just making things happen.
That's initiative.

725
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,980
So here's what it says about initiative
action in the absence of specific

726
00:46:31,981 --> 00:46:32,640
direction,

727
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:37,640
seeing what needs to be done and acting
without prompting the instinct to begin

728
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:42,780
a task and follow through
energetically on one's own accord,

729
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,440
being creative, proactive, and decisive,

730
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:52,200
transforming opportunity into action.
So that's what initiatives,

731
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,730
if you're on the low end,

732
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,810
you demonstrate willingness to take action
in the absence of absence of specific

733
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:02,550
direction, acts commensurate with
grade training and experience.

734
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,230
That's what we expect of you. Little
bit, little bit better in the middle,

735
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,360
self motivated,
an action oriented

736
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,920
foresight and energy consistently
transform opportunity into action.

737
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:20,580
Develops and pursues creative
initiative solutions or sorry,

738
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,660
innovative solutions acts
without prompting. Self
starter. That's what we want.

739
00:47:24,661 --> 00:47:26,580
And then here we go.
The high end,

740
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,100
highly motivated and proactive displays,

741
00:47:30,101 --> 00:47:32,830
exceptional awareness of
surroundings and environment.

742
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,780
Uncanny ability to anticipate mission
requirements and quickly formulate

743
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,540
original far reaching solutions

744
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:46,460
always takes decisive, effective
action with definitions like that,

745
00:47:46,461 --> 00:47:49,100
it's no wonder there's only been one
marina at the top of that Christmas tree

746
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,070
because that is a squared away
individual right there. Far region.

747
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,790
Know what's crazy about this?

748
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,690
Having put so many people
through training myself,

749
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,760
even though there's only
one allotted space up there,

750
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,270
there are so many people that are
capable of this kind of behavior.

751
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:13,330
It's way more than 1% it's way more than
10% if you have people that understand

752
00:48:14,901 --> 00:48:17,090
what the parameters are
and really aim towards,

753
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:21,380
you can get a lot closer than most
people would think. Yeah, and I,

754
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:24,710
I mean I obviously, I don't
know, but it seems like what you,

755
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,510
what you're talking about, if they,
like a lot of people just don't know

756
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,120
the standard and the, you know, they
don't know. Yeah, they don't know.

757
00:48:32,121 --> 00:48:35,930
It's not been made clear to them.
The next section,

758
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,390
leadership, and this is broken
into multiple sections obviously,

759
00:48:41,391 --> 00:48:43,640
because leadership is the most
important thing on the battlefield.

760
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,810
So this is their biggest section.
Leadership section number one,

761
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:49,070
leading subordinates.

762
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,090
The inseparable relationship
between leader and lead,

763
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,750
the application of leadership principles
to provide direction and motivate

764
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:58,460
subordinates using authority,

765
00:48:58,461 --> 00:49:02,340
persuasion and personality to influence
subordinates to accomplish assigned

766
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,183
tasks,

767
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:08,450
sustaining motivation and morale while
maximizing subordinates performance.

768
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:11,300
So there you go. That's what you're
going to do as a leader. Low End

769
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,270
engaged provides instructions and directs.

770
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:21,250
Execution seeks to accomplish mission in
ways that sustain motivation and morale

771
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:25,850
actions contribute to unit effectiveness.
Cool. So you're acceptable. Yeah.

772
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,750
Middle Ground.

773
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:29,970
Okay.

774
00:49:29,970 --> 00:49:33,750
Achieves a highly effective balance
between direction and delegation.

775
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,130
We're talking a little dichotomy.
Effectively.

776
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,700
Task subordinates and clearly
delineates extent. Standards,

777
00:49:43,701 --> 00:49:48,140
expected enhances performance
through constructive supervision,

778
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,110
fosters motivation,
enhances morale,

779
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:54,920
builds and sustains teams that
successfully meet mission requirements,

780
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,490
encourages initiative and
candor among subordinates.

781
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,730
So you can see that the,
the low end,

782
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,820
you're kind of just telling people
what to do a little bit right.

783
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,753
Hmm.

784
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:10,130
Now you're starting to ask for feedback.

785
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,400
You're starting to build that bond.
Here's the high end

786
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:19,740
number one thing for the high end
promotes creativity and energy among

787
00:50:19,741 --> 00:50:20,990
subordinates by striking it.

788
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:26,010
The ideal balance of direction and
delegation achieves highest of performance

789
00:50:28,431 --> 00:50:32,600
from subordinates by encouraging
individual initiative.

790
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,070
That's decentralized command.

791
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,280
I'm going to let you guys run and
that's going to maximize performance.

792
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,810
This is an incredible term in genders,

793
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,060
willing subordination,

794
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,530
loyalty and trust that allows
subordinates to overcome their perceived

795
00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:49,364
limitations.

796
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,750
Willing subordination when your
team actually wants to follow you.

797
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,200
Personal leadership fosters highest
level of motivation and morale,

798
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,680
ensuring mission accomplishment even
in the most difficult circumstances.

799
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:10,970
Next section, developing
subordinates, commitment to train,

800
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,900
educate and challenge all marines
regardless of race, religion,

801
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,810
ethnic background or gender mentorship,

802
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:21,890
cultivating professional and PR and
personal development of subordinates,

803
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:24,230
developing team players in a spree decor,

804
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:29,290
ability to combine teaching and coaching,
creating an atmosphere,

805
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:34,000
tolerant of mistakes in the
course of learning. You'll hear,

806
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:35,830
you'll think about that very
often in the marine corps. Hey,

807
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:38,200
we're tolerant of mistakes.
That's how you learn.

808
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,380
Low End of the spectrum maintains
an environment that allows personal

809
00:51:41,381 --> 00:51:45,010
professional development and sure his
subordinates participate in all mandated

810
00:51:45,011 --> 00:51:46,180
development programs.

811
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:51,520
Ground develops an institutes,
innovative programs.

812
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,890
It's you're proactively trying to
bring up and raise your subordinates,

813
00:51:56,891 --> 00:51:59,350
make them better to include PMA,

814
00:51:59,351 --> 00:52:03,670
which is professional military
education that emphasize personal and

815
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:06,090
professional development
of subordinates challenges,

816
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,380
subordinates to exceed
their perceived potential,

817
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,640
thereby enhancing unit morale
and effectiveness creates
an environment where all

818
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:16,270
marines are competent to learn
through trial and error as a mentor.

819
00:52:16,271 --> 00:52:20,410
Prepare subordinates for increased
responsibility and duties.

820
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,140
By the way, this is the number
two item under leadership.

821
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:30,230
The first one is leading, the second
one is developing your subordinates.

822
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,990
Here's the top end of the spectrum.

823
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,890
Widely recognized and
emulated as a teacher,

824
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,180
coach and leader.

825
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,320
Any marine would desire to serve with
this marine because they know they will

826
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:46,300
grow personally and professionally.

827
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:52,310
Subordinate and unit performance far
surpasses expected results due to

828
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:55,550
mentorship and team building talents.

829
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,760
Attitude toward subordinate
development is infectious,

830
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:04,150
extending beyond the
unit that that's bold.

831
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,420
Now you are training your people so well
that other people in other units are

832
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:14,530
starting to train their people.
Think about that impact right there.

833
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:15,940
That's how you develop.

834
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:19,630
You develop your subordinates so much
that some other leader in a different

835
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,310
company,
in a different platoon,

836
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,520
in a different battalion says we're
going to start following that program.

837
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:27,900
Going to start it up. Yeah,
that's leadership right there.

838
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:36,540
Section number three is setting the
example the most visible facet of

839
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:40,770
leadership. How well a marine serves
as a role model for all others.

840
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:45,420
Personal action demonstrates the highest
standards of conduct, ethical behavior,

841
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:50,510
fitness and appearance bearing demeanor
and self discipline are elements.

842
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:53,723
Low end

843
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,290
maintains Marie corn
standards for appearance,

844
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:03,291
weight and uniform where sustains required
level of physical fitness and ears to

845
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:07,470
the tenants of the Marine Corps.
Values fine. You're accepted.

846
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,700
Middle-Grade personal conduct on and
off duty reflects highest marine core

847
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,350
standards of integrity
bearing and appearance.

848
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,170
Character is exceptional.

849
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,150
Actively seek self improvement
in wide ranging areas.

850
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,110
Dedication to duty and professional
example. Encourage others.

851
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:32,180
Self improvement efforts.
That's the middle grade them.

852
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,780
In the middle grade,

853
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,640
you reflect the highest marine
core standards of integrity
bearing in appearance.

854
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:44,220
You know what that means? That means
24 hours a day you're in the game.

855
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,000
That's what that means.
It means you're active,

856
00:54:48,210 --> 00:54:51,600
actively seeking self improvement
in wide ranging areas.

857
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,340
You're trying to get better everywhere.
That's middle ground by the way.

858
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:57,323
High Ground

859
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:03,680
Model Marine frequently
emulated exemplary conduct.

860
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:07,580
Behavior and actions are tones.

861
00:55:07,581 --> 00:55:12,240
Setting an inspiration to subordinates,
peers and seniors.

862
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:17,640
Remarkable dedication to
improving self and others.

863
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:25,160
What are you trying to do to get better?
For me,

864
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:29,420
as I say that said that on this podcast
since day one we're trying to get better.

865
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,660
What are you doing actually?
Yeah. What's, what's the activity?

866
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,870
Because if you knew another word you see
here a lot and this is action, action,

867
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:40,910
action words into action, ideas
and actions. Skills into action.

868
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:42,003
Hmm.

869
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,780
I was going back and forth with
a guy that I did some work with,

870
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,130
four echelon front,

871
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:53,900
and I worked with him quite
a few years ago overseas,

872
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:57,950
and we still text back and
forth from time to time, and

873
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:03,140
he, I said, hey, because he was telling
me some of the notes he had taken it.

874
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,360
I said, send me some of the notes.
One of the notes that he's from,

875
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,580
the first note he sent me was,

876
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:12,710
you can't think things better.

877
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,870
No, it's, it's,

878
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:22,930
it's a solid piece of advice because
he's one of these guys that that was a

879
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:28,090
thinker, right? Yeah. The big thinker, and
I'm all about thinking, you know, let's,

880
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,450
let's develop our brain.
Let's develop our mind power.

881
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,140
Let's think about things. Let's
be thoughtful. That's fine,

882
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:38,320
but you can't think things better.

883
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:41,170
They're not going to get better
unless you actually apply the skills,

884
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:43,570
skills into action.
Fobts into action.

885
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,640
Next,
ensuring wellbeing of subordinates.

886
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,570
The genuine interest in the wellbeing
of marines enhances subordinates ability

887
00:56:59,621 --> 00:57:02,500
to concentrate.
Focus on mission accomplishment.

888
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,010
Concern for family readiness is inherent.

889
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,000
The importance placed on welfare of
subordinates is based on the belief that

890
00:57:10,001 --> 00:57:12,430
marines take care of their own

891
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:18,580
low end of the spectrum deals confidently
with issues pertinent to subordinate

892
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:21,850
welfare and recognize a suitable courses
of action that supports subordinates.

893
00:57:21,851 --> 00:57:23,920
Wellbeing applies available resources,

894
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:28,460
allowing subordinates to effectively
concentrate on the mission. At a minimum,

895
00:57:28,461 --> 00:57:30,260
you're absolutely taken
care of your people.

896
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,210
Middle grade instills and or reinforces
a sense of responsibility among junior

897
00:57:35,211 --> 00:57:40,211
marines for themselves and
their subordinates actively
fosters the development

898
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:44,930
of and uses support system search for
subordinates which improved their ability

899
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:49,490
to contribute to unit mission
accomplishment efforts
to enhance subordinate

900
00:57:49,491 --> 00:57:52,430
welfare, improve the units ability
to accomplish their mission.

901
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,880
People don't think about that fact
that the people that are actually

902
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:59,650
accomplishing the mission,
our people,

903
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,520
and if those people aren't ready to
perform because you've neglected them,

904
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:05,200
you're not going to be to
accomplish the mission.

905
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:12,550
High grade noticeably enhances
subordinates wellbeing,

906
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:15,610
resulting in measurable
increase in unit effectiveness,

907
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:20,290
maximizes unit and base resources to
provide subordinates with the best support

908
00:58:20,291 --> 00:58:21,010
available.

909
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:25,630
Proactive approach serves to energize
unit members to take care of their own,

910
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:29,660
thereby correcting potential problems
before they can hinder subordinates

911
00:58:29,661 --> 00:58:30,494
effectiveness.

912
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:35,300
Widely recognized for techniques and
policies that produce results and build

913
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:39,950
morale, builds strong family
atmosphere, puts motto,

914
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,090
mission first,
Marines always into action.

915
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,793
Boom.

916
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,340
Last section for leadership

917
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,070
communication skills,

918
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:02,420
the efficient transmission and receipt
of thoughts and ideas that enable and

919
00:59:02,421 --> 00:59:06,920
enhance leadership. Equal importance
given to listening, speaking,

920
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,270
writing and critical reading skills.
Interactive,

921
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:14,420
allowing one to perceive
problems and situations.

922
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:19,600
Provide concise guidance and expects
xpress complex ideas in a form easily

923
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,050
understood by

924
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,270
allows subordinates to ask questions,

925
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,420
raise issues and concerns and venture
opinions contributes to a leader's ability

926
00:59:32,701 --> 00:59:34,680
to motivate as well as council.

927
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:37,973
Minimum

928
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:44,140
skilled and receiving and conveying
information communicates effectively in

929
00:59:44,141 --> 00:59:46,090
performance of duties.
That's the minimum

930
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:51,990
above average middle grade.

931
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,560
Clearly articulate thoughts and
ideas verbally and in writing.

932
00:59:58,170 --> 01:00:02,580
Let's think about that
middle ground.

933
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:08,540
Do you know how hard it is for people
to clearly articulate faults and ideas

934
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:10,020
verbally and in writing?

935
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:15,560
It is a skill you need
to work on all the time.

936
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,080
By the way.
This gets you a middle grade here.

937
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,130
Communication in all forms is accurate,
intelligent,

938
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,750
concise and timely.

939
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,640
Those standards accurate,
intelligent, concise and timely

940
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,900
communicates with clarity and verve.

941
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:43,930
Ensuring understanding of intent or
purpose encourages and considers the

942
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:46,070
contributions of others

943
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,430
high grade.
Here we go.

944
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,320
Highly developed facility
in verbal communication,

945
01:00:55,890 --> 01:01:00,890
adept in composing written documents of
the highest quality combines presence

946
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:07,080
and verbal skills which indent in gender
confidence and achieve understanding

947
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:12,081
irrespective of setting situation
or size of group addressed displays.

948
01:01:13,921 --> 01:01:17,670
An intuitive sense of
when and how to listen,

949
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:22,173
so,

950
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,150
okay,

951
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:28,290
read, write, speak, listen
and do it all the time.

952
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,960
If you're in a leadership
position or you want to be in one.

953
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:34,063
Okay.

954
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,870
The the reading part,
people ask me what I learned in college.

955
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:42,420
One of the most important things that I
learned in college was I was an English

956
01:01:42,421 --> 01:01:45,120
major. This is why I was an
English major by the way,

957
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,680
because I recognized when
I was at a seal team,

958
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,600
as a young officer that one of the
most important things I was going to be

959
01:01:54,601 --> 01:01:56,700
dealing with was communicating
with other humans.

960
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,710
And I needed to have good command of
the English language and of reading and

961
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,880
writing the English language.

962
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:08,390
But when I had to decipher Shakespeare
and I took a lot of Shakespeare and you

963
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,670
realize that you don't know what words
mean and you realize that you don't

964
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:16,260
understand the sentence
construction and you,

965
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:19,650
what you realize is that you have to
break them down and go them and figure it

966
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:19,920
out.

967
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,340
So when I would get the
rules of engagement from up
the chain of command five

968
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:24,174
years later,

969
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,150
and I didn't understand them because they
were using words I didn't know, I said,

970
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:30,480
okay, what I needed to do
is look these up, read it,

971
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,150
find out some substitute words,
make sense of it,

972
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,780
look up the definition of what they're
specifically talking about and go from

973
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:39,480
there.
Because when you first,

974
01:02:39,481 --> 01:02:42,570
if you just open up Shakespeare
and you don't understand something,

975
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:43,620
what do you do?
You say it's stupid.

976
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,770
When somebody writes a rules of engagement
and there's words in there you don't

977
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:47,191
understand.

978
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,970
If you don't understand how to parse
things apart and look up definitions and

979
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:54,660
can't be humble enough to recognize that
there's some things that you don't know

980
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,360
well then all you do is
go all this is stupid.

981
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:02,750
Check communications.

982
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:07,053
The next thing,

983
01:03:08,110 --> 01:03:13,110
no one really probably thinks that this
is going to be in here for the Marine

984
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:18,130
Corps. The next section you're getting
graded on as graded on as a marine.

985
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:19,930
His intellect and wisdom.

986
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,600
Yeah,

987
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,720
thanks to people in the military
is a bunch of knuckle draggers.

988
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:27,170
Think it's all about brand,

989
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:29,573
but there you go.

990
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,740
Intellect and wisdom, intellect
and wisdom, professional,

991
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,690
military education.
PME,

992
01:03:36,990 --> 01:03:41,220
committed to intellectual growth in
ways beneficial to the Marine Corps.

993
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Increases breadth and depth of war
fighting and leadership aptitude.

994
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:50,970
Resources include residents,
schools,

995
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,330
professional qualifications
and certification processes,

996
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,970
nonresident and other extension courses.

997
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,270
Civilian educational
institutional coursework.

998
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,890
A personal reading program that includes
but is not limited to selections from

999
01:04:04,891 --> 01:04:06,330
the commandant's reading list,

1000
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:11,880
participation in discussion groups and
military societies and involvement in

1001
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,710
learning through new technologies.

1002
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,450
Okay,

1003
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:19,380
you got to get in the game, right?
They're going to get educated.

1004
01:04:20,430 --> 01:04:25,430
Here's low end maintains currency and
required military skills and related

1005
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:29,370
developments has completed or is enrolled.

1006
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:32,880
Inappropriate level of PME for
grade and level of experience.

1007
01:04:32,881 --> 01:04:36,720
Recognizes and understands new and
creative approaches to service issues.

1008
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:40,200
Remains abreast of contemporary
concepts and issues.

1009
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,063
Yeah.

1010
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:47,110
Middle-Grade PME outlook expense expands
beyond Mos and required education.

1011
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:49,910
So you're not even worry about your
own job. You've got that covered.

1012
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:51,500
Now you're going outside
of what your job is,

1013
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:55,670
develops and follows a comprehensive
personal program which includes broadened

1014
01:04:55,671 --> 01:04:58,790
professional reading and
or academic coursework,

1015
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:01,160
advances new concepts and ideas.

1016
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:07,540
And here's your high end dedicated to
lifelong learning as a result of active

1017
01:05:10,061 --> 01:05:11,260
and continuous efforts,

1018
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:16,350
widely recognized as an intellectual
leader in professionally related topics,

1019
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,910
makes time for study and takes
advantage of all resources and programs,

1020
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:25,570
introduces new and creative
approaches to service issues,

1021
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:30,070
engages in a broad spectrum
of forums and dialogues.

1022
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,960
So this is never going to stop.
You've got to keep feeding your brain.

1023
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,240
The next thing you're getting graded on.
Intellect and wisdom, decision making,

1024
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:48,040
ability, viable and
timely problems, solution,

1025
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,330
contributing elements.

1026
01:05:49,331 --> 01:05:54,190
Our judgment and decisiveness decisions
reflect the balance between an optimal

1027
01:05:54,191 --> 01:05:58,570
solution and a satisfactory workable
solution that generates tempo.

1028
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:03,190
So there's a good dichotomy for you.
Optimal decision on on one side,

1029
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,640
workable decision that can keep
you moving. On the other side,

1030
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,260
you've got to balance that dichotomy.

1031
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:13,240
Decisions are made within the context
of the commanders established intent and

1032
01:06:13,241 --> 01:06:15,130
the goal of mission accomplishment.

1033
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:19,990
So of course you're trying to support
the commander's intent. Anticipation,

1034
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:24,070
mental agility,
intuition and success are inherent.

1035
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,400
This is not the first time they
brought up intuition in here.

1036
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:32,350
How you develop into intuition,
experience, wisdom, breeding,

1037
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:35,223
low end,

1038
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:40,930
low end makes sound decisions leading to
mission accomplishment as the minimum.

1039
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:45,190
The minimum was to make sound decisions
actively collects and evaluates

1040
01:06:45,191 --> 01:06:49,060
information that ways alternative
alternatives to achieve timely results,

1041
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:52,690
confidently approaches problems,
accepts responsibility for outcomes.

1042
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:57,820
Middle-Grade demonstrates mental agility.

1043
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:00,280
Okay,

1044
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,330
effectively prioritizes and
solves multiple complex problems.

1045
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,620
This prioritize and execute

1046
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:12,210
analytical abilities enhanced by
experience, education, and intuition,

1047
01:07:13,290 --> 01:07:17,760
anticipates problems and into
implements viable longterm solutions,

1048
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:22,200
solutions, steadfast, willing
to make difficult decisions.

1049
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:28,160
That's a, that's a high bar
for middle grade, high grade,

1050
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:33,740
widely recognized and sought after
to resolve the most critical,

1051
01:07:33,741 --> 01:07:35,120
complex problems.

1052
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:40,400
Seldom matched analytical
and intuitive abilities.

1053
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:45,860
Accurately foresees unexpected problems
and arrives at wealthtime decisions

1054
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:48,410
despite fog and friction,

1055
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:55,380
completely confident approach to all
problems masterfully strikes a balance

1056
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:01,390
between the desire for perfect
knowledge and greater tempo,

1057
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:10,460
widely recognized
to solve problems.

1058
01:08:11,270 --> 01:08:12,830
This one though,
this little line here,

1059
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:17,990
accurately foresees unexpected problems
and arrives at wealthtime decisions

1060
01:08:17,991 --> 01:08:22,430
despite fog and friction as a big ask
right there, you gotta be in the game,

1061
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,000
you gotta be in the game
to get to that level.

1062
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:31,580
Last thing you're getting great on, on
for intellect and wisdom, his judgment,

1063
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:37,280
the discretionary aspect of decision
making draws and core values,

1064
01:08:37,281 --> 01:08:40,670
knowledge and personal
experience to make wise choices.

1065
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:41,940
Okay.

1066
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:46,940
Comprehends the consequences of
contemplated courses of action.

1067
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:48,980
Okay.

1068
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:53,930
Minimum Grade Majority of judgments
are measured, circumspect,

1069
01:08:53,931 --> 01:08:55,400
relevant and correct.

1070
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:01,360
Minimum middle-grade
decisions are constant,

1071
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,980
our scar consistent and uniformly correct.

1072
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,930
Tempered by consideration of their
consequences. Able to identify, isolate,

1073
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:12,320
and assess relevant factors in
the decision making process.

1074
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:16,190
Opinion sought by others,
subordinates personally,

1075
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,250
personal interest in
favor of impartiality.

1076
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:21,350
Okay.

1077
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:24,500
And the high end decisions
reflect exceptional,

1078
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:28,730
exceptional insight and wisdom.
Beyond this marine's experience,

1079
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:34,630
counsel sought by all often an arbiter
consistent superior judgement inspires

1080
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,440
the confidence of seniors.

1081
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:46,850
So that's how you get graded
on intellect and wisdom.

1082
01:09:46,910 --> 01:09:51,560
And actually the last thing that they
grade you on is they actually grade you on

1083
01:09:51,561 --> 01:09:55,970
how well you evaluate your other marines.

1084
01:09:56,510 --> 01:10:00,140
The extent to which this officer serving
as a reported official conducted or

1085
01:10:00,141 --> 01:10:05,090
required others to conduct accurate
uninflated and timely evaluations.

1086
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:09,220
This is the last thing you get great
at all and they go through and you're,

1087
01:10:09,221 --> 01:10:11,030
the low end is like you did a good job.

1088
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:15,560
The high end is you do an outstanding job,

1089
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:19,760
but they're grading you on how well you
grade. And then you get to the last page,

1090
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,150
which is where this is where
you have the Christmas tree,

1091
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:28,180
the Eagle Globe and anchor Christmas
tree comparative assessment provide a

1092
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:33,251
comparative assessment of potential by
placing an x in the appropriate box in

1093
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:35,510
marking the comparison,

1094
01:10:35,511 --> 01:10:40,100
consider all the marines have this grade
whose professional abilities are known

1095
01:10:40,101 --> 01:10:43,190
to you personally.
And then you go through that tree,

1096
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,520
the unqualified on satisfactory,
a qualified marine,

1097
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,030
one of the many highly
qualified professionals who
formed the majority of this

1098
01:10:50,031 --> 01:10:54,200
grade, one of the few
exceptionally qualified marines.

1099
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,830
And then you get to the top,

1100
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:03,250
the singular marine at the top who
is the eminently qualified marine,

1101
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:10,480
the eminently qualified marine.
And

1102
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,510
that's what I think makes this,

1103
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,020
makes this interesting,

1104
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:25,070
is to to consider that
statement imminently qualified

1105
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,110
and think about where you're at

1106
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,540
and you're, you're not at
the top. I'm out of the top.

1107
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:41,030
None of us are at the top who can be,

1108
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,380
but what are we striving to be?

1109
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:49,180
What are we striving to be?

1110
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:54,390
Are we striving to be the most eminently
qualified human being that we can be?

1111
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:01,860
Do you even know what that means?

1112
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:04,830
Do you even have those
thoughts in your head?

1113
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,790
I'm guessing you don't.
I barely do.

1114
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:14,390
I know I've had vague thoughts.

1115
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:20,000
I know I had definitions that floated
around in my head of what I was trying to

1116
01:12:20,001 --> 01:12:22,130
be,
what I'm trying to be today,

1117
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:25,370
but why aren't those solid?

1118
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:28,983
Why aren't they?

1119
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:34,570
I was, I was thinking about this. I was
talking to Dave Burke deal Tafe. Yeah,

1120
01:12:35,380 --> 01:12:38,680
good deal, Dave. And I was like,
Hey, we need to build this.

1121
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,560
You're basically an
evaluation system for humans

1122
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:51,910
to become eminently qualified as a human.
What does that look like?

1123
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,190
Not only to graved yourself,

1124
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,300
but to actually know what
you are trying to be.

1125
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,980
So Dave and I will work on that.
So stand by to get some

1126
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:09,950
and until,
until we do get that out,

1127
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:15,050
then think about,

1128
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:21,590
think about are there areas that,

1129
01:13:21,591 --> 01:13:22,424
you know

1130
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:28,280
what the goal is that you're walking
around thinking that you deserve a 5.0

1131
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:35,570
but you really actually,
he really actually deserve to.

1132
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:41,240
I know I do that. Yes.
Right? I'm thinking I'm good.

1133
01:13:41,241 --> 01:13:44,000
I'm walking around. I'm thinking I'm
running everything right. I'm thinking,

1134
01:13:44,001 --> 01:13:46,730
I'm thinking I'd come correct.

1135
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,680
Yes. But the reality is
I don't, you know, and,

1136
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:54,530
and the reality is that you have that
little moving goalpost in your head.

1137
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:56,030
You move it around a little bit,
right?

1138
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:57,920
You give yourself a little
bit more slack one day,

1139
01:13:57,921 --> 01:13:59,630
then you tighten it up cause
you're feeling good the next day,

1140
01:13:59,631 --> 01:14:01,760
then you slack it off a little bit more.
But I think as far as you're concerned,

1141
01:14:01,761 --> 01:14:04,610
that's a five. Oh, right.
You're there. You're in there.

1142
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:07,940
And the reality is,

1143
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:14,110
I don't measure up the way I should
be measuring up on a daily basis.

1144
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:15,063
Yeah.

1145
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,800
On an hourly basis.
Who's grading me?

1146
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:25,080
Who's lagging to me? You
know, who is me? Yeah.

1147
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:26,500
Yeah,

1148
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,460
me.
But until we clarify what the aim is,

1149
01:14:30,461 --> 01:14:33,640
what the goal is and
what those standards are,

1150
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:36,310
how am I supposed to hold
myself accountable to those
standards when they don't

1151
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:39,160
even exist? So I'm going to make them
exist. Yeah. I'm going to put them in.

1152
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,660
I'm going to put them on paper.

1153
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,500
We're going to come up with that
eminently qualified human being.

1154
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:48,610
What that looks like because we all got
all got ideas floating around up there.

1155
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:49,733
Yeah.

1156
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:54,850
Well I'm going to bring it, bring it. I'm
going to apply that. Put it into action.

1157
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,560
Put it into action. Right. Are we doing
everything that we could be doing?

1158
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:03,100
Everything that we should be doing? Are
we cutting corners? Are we slacking off?

1159
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:07,780
We'd given ourselves a 5.0 when we
should be at best. Cracking a too

1160
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:15,220
daily. How much are we leaving
on the table every day?
That's a question for you,

1161
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,530
right? How much are we leaving
on the table? How much you
say, Nah, you know what?

1162
01:15:19,531 --> 01:15:24,370
I can just leave that
there. It's fine. How much?

1163
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:27,700
How many things just do you
accept this collateral damage?

1164
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:29,880
Like something goes wrong,

1165
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,580
like one thing goes wrong and so
there's just collateral damage.

1166
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,860
Other things are just gonna fall by
the way. And you're good with it. Yeah,

1167
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:40,060
you're good with it.
You, you, you know you,

1168
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:43,550
I hurt my knee. Oh, cool. Guess
what? I'm gonna eat a donut, right?

1169
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:44,690
Is that where we're at?

1170
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:50,660
Is that where we're at or is there
collateral damage? Oh, work was hard.

1171
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:53,690
Therefore I'm going to know,
treat my family, not going to,

1172
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,330
not going to have good
family quality time tonight.

1173
01:15:56,570 --> 01:16:01,390
Collateral damage because they what
to expect from me. Yeah. Right?

1174
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:05,930
Where's the collateral damage? Why are
we allowing this collateral damage will,

1175
01:16:05,931 --> 01:16:08,860
part of the reason I'm telling you that
we allow this collateral damage just

1176
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:13,690
cause we're not effectively grading
ourselves. And even worse than that,

1177
01:16:13,691 --> 01:16:16,780
we don't even know what standard
we're trying to achieve.

1178
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:20,890
No one's even told us the
minimum standard. Okay,

1179
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,160
so why is your life going marginal
right now? Why are you doing okay?

1180
01:16:24,161 --> 01:16:28,750
Why am I doing okay right now? Well, it's
because I have some vague idea. I have, I,

1181
01:16:28,930 --> 01:16:32,140
I kind of know I'm heading in
the right general direction.

1182
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:37,130
That's not good enough to get
maximum.

1183
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:41,390
It's not good enough to be eminently
qualified. It does. It doesn't work.

1184
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,400
You have to step it up.

1185
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,333
Okay.

1186
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:48,173
You have to,

1187
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:54,320
you have to have the unmitigated daily
discipline in all things and that's hard.

1188
01:16:55,051 --> 01:16:59,250
It's hard for one day.
Never mind every single day.

1189
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,300
So I'm going to make this evaluation.
Dave and I are going to make it.

1190
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:10,250
I'll get it out to y'all and until then,

1191
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:12,650
and I'll try and get it turned
around as quick as possible.

1192
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:13,730
At least some kind of a,

1193
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:15,460
okay.

1194
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:20,300
What is it called? An early version. A
Beta test? Is that what it's called? Uh,

1195
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:24,960
sure. I think, no, the
technology. Right, right, right,
right. Yeah, sure. Beta test.

1196
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:25,920
We'll get a Beta test.

1197
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:30,010
We're trying to get something out there
quick and until then start looking at

1198
01:17:30,011 --> 01:17:34,330
yourself as usual, your
strengths, your weaknesses,

1199
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,690
and start trying to see
where you can improve.

1200
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:39,900
Okay.

1201
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:44,900
Start moving towards the goal of becoming
the eminently qualified human beings

1202
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:50,303
where we're heading.

1203
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:55,710
And I think that is all
I've got for tonight.

1204
01:17:55,711 --> 01:17:59,050
So Echo Charles, what do you got? Well

1205
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,470
I got, I know, I know. We're trying
to step up. Yup. We got thoughts.

1206
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:08,390
Well yeah. So you, and you
actually mentioned it in
like bright there at the end.

1207
01:18:08,391 --> 01:18:11,810
There were all these Little
Eva oh that little bit.

1208
01:18:11,811 --> 01:18:13,490
All these evaluations are like,
you know,

1209
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:15,680
you do this consistently
and all this stuff.

1210
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:21,500
It's so there's two kind of parts
to that one. I was thinking you,

1211
01:18:21,890 --> 01:18:25,430
you have to do all these good things,
right? To be the minimum or to be the,

1212
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:28,310
you know, you, you can't even really be
in the group if you're not in the minimum.

1213
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:30,980
Right.
But you got to do those things every day.

1214
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:34,080
Like you have to essentially be
known for these things. Yeah. So,

1215
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,880
so how we get jammed up,
I think when we do,

1216
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:41,090
when we are conscious of like how good
am I doing in Xyz area of my life or

1217
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,220
whatever, and if it's something
that you're working on,

1218
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:46,370
a lot of times we don't get the accurate
evaluation to ourselves because we'll

1219
01:18:46,371 --> 01:18:50,300
do, we'll do it really good one day
and we'll do a really good two days.

1220
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,520
And I'm like, Dang, I'm
pretty good at this,

1221
01:18:52,730 --> 01:18:55,790
so I'm going to go ahead and get
myself for like a four or whatever.

1222
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:58,400
But meanwhile you only did
it twice, meaning, you know,

1223
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,870
in the whole week you did it twice.

1224
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:03,080
You're so happy because it's this big
change because you usually do it zero

1225
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:05,270
times. Yeah. So you're
like, hey, I got this.

1226
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:09,680
Your minimum bar was set so low that
you think you're crushing it. Oh yeah.

1227
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:10,330
Oh yeah.

1228
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,640
Good Times a near miss because in your
mind you kind of are comparatively

1229
01:19:13,641 --> 01:19:16,680
speaking, heritable thing. Is it like
if you have a standard and stuff,

1230
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:19,190
then you can act more accurately,
but we don't have standard.

1231
01:19:19,191 --> 01:19:23,050
So in your mind it feels like, oh, I
got this, I got it licked. I'm, I'm,

1232
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,850
I'm a four now. You know, I used
to be a one, I'm a fort now.

1233
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,160
So meanwhile you're not a
four year actually still a
one. Yeah. Really, really?

1234
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:30,830
Yeah.

1235
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:34,460
You think you're, you're,
and there's also, there's
also this, there's also an a,

1236
01:19:34,461 --> 01:19:38,360
and I, I talked to Dave about
this a little bit. There's a,

1237
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,470
there's a short term grade and there's a
longterm grade, because check this out.

1238
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:43,731
Let's say you,

1239
01:19:43,731 --> 01:19:47,960
let's say you've never worked out before
and you've been watching video games

1240
01:19:47,961 --> 01:19:51,720
and eating donuts and,
and just, you know, in,

1241
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:54,920
in bad physical shape. Yeah. Your grade,

1242
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,510
your overall grade for
physical fitness is whatever.

1243
01:19:59,511 --> 01:20:02,570
It's a 1.0 it's a low,
it's the lowest it can go.

1244
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,890
But daily if you get up, okay, look, look,

1245
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:11,610
I can only run one mile and it's going
to take me 20 minutes, 22 minutes,

1246
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:15,060
I'm going to do it. And then I'm
going to do as many pushups as I can,

1247
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:17,490
which is 23.
By the way,

1248
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:23,910
if I did a one mile run in 22 minutes
and did 23 pushups, that would,

1249
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:28,460
I would get a 1.0 for the day. Yeah. But
this individual that's been on the couch,

1250
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:32,430
the living a sedentary lifestyle,
if he does that, guess what?

1251
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:33,443
He's going to get him.

1252
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:37,070
He's going to get a high grades
going to get a 4.8 for the day. Hmm.

1253
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:41,030
So then he's leaving himself
in the right direction. Yeah.

1254
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:45,810
So not only is that, not only do you have
to, this is one of the problems in it.

1255
01:20:45,811 --> 01:20:50,430
And again, this is something I told
Dave, I'm like, listen, uh, once,

1256
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,730
uh,
by annual twice a year,

1257
01:20:53,731 --> 01:20:56,220
every six months you're getting
a grade that doesn't help you.

1258
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,180
What you need to look
at yourself every day.

1259
01:21:00,540 --> 01:21:02,490
You need to look at
yourself every day and say,

1260
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,550
did I truly do live this way,

1261
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,060
live the way I should be living today?
Yeah.

1262
01:21:09,390 --> 01:21:14,390
And then those standards need to be
clear and then you need to apply them to

1263
01:21:15,361 --> 01:21:16,500
your life.
Yeah.

1264
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:22,060
I might even say like the, the, the,
that that example you just gave.

1265
01:21:22,061 --> 01:21:26,050
So the guy who was sitting on the couch
all the time whenever or every day and

1266
01:21:26,051 --> 01:21:28,090
now he's doing it.
He's working out every day,

1267
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:30,760
but his physical fitness standard
technically is still low.

1268
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:35,770
Still be at a 1.0 maybe another
area of evaluation is like,

1269
01:21:36,521 --> 01:21:40,930
you know, improvement or are you know to
say or back when you're young, you know,

1270
01:21:40,931 --> 01:21:43,270
they give you that most
improved kind of thing. Yeah.

1271
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:49,050
Maybe that could be part of it. I think
it will be covered by the daily track,

1272
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:52,380
the daily track, like, okay,
you got to, you got a 4.0 today.

1273
01:21:52,381 --> 01:21:54,450
What's your average right now?
My average for the last,

1274
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:59,451
my running average for 30 days is
I'm hitting a 3.9 physical fitness.

1275
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:03,120
That means I'm doing something every day.
I'm pushing the envelope, I'm improving.

1276
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:08,330
Now my overall score is moved
from a one to a 1.2 yeah.

1277
01:22:09,110 --> 01:22:11,010
Cause I'm,
I'm in a little bit better shape,

1278
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:13,210
but it's still not where it needs to be.
But guess what?

1279
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,420
That can crush them people.
Right?

1280
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:17,840
If someone goes to a 1.2 I'm
never going to improve it.

1281
01:22:17,841 --> 01:22:22,140
So it's been three months. No guess what
would you get today? What'd you do today?

1282
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:26,190
Same thing. Opposite, right? The opposite
can happen where someone thinks, well,

1283
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:30,930
I did something, I did something
today, so I'm good man. No, no.

1284
01:22:30,931 --> 01:22:32,370
And the other collateral damages,

1285
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,090
I did good physical fitness today,

1286
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:41,010
so I'm going to take tomorrow off or I'm
going to eat a, you know, a crappy meal.

1287
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:45,750
Yeah. We get that pizza together.
Right? We don't want that. We,

1288
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:50,370
and when I say we, I mean me.
Yeah. In that, why is that?

1289
01:22:50,371 --> 01:22:54,420
Because we've, we've,
we've created this, this,

1290
01:22:55,230 --> 01:23:00,230
this pliable standard in our head that
we move around based on our little

1291
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:05,920
feelings. You, but, but this does,

1292
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:09,820
this won't allow for it.
You need to keep yourself in check.

1293
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,340
You need to keep yourself
in check at all times.

1294
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:15,610
And the reason you need to keep your
check self in check at all times,

1295
01:23:15,930 --> 01:23:19,690
you need to impose discipline on your
life because you will end up in a better

1296
01:23:19,691 --> 01:23:23,560
situation that you will end
up in a better situation.

1297
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:27,460
You'll end up with more freedom is where
you're gonna end up. You know, people,

1298
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:32,710
you talk about regret, right? Oh,
you go talk to people when they're,

1299
01:23:32,740 --> 01:23:35,470
when they're dying on their
death bed and they're,

1300
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,120
they're going to regret
things they didn't do.

1301
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:41,920
There's nothing I can imagine you're
going to regret more than when you look

1302
01:23:41,921 --> 01:23:45,430
back at your life. And you said, and I
didn't achieve what I could have achieved.

1303
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:48,490
Yeah. And there's only one way
to maximize your achievement.

1304
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:53,470
And that's to get daily discipline,
daily discipline. And again,

1305
01:23:53,471 --> 01:23:55,480
when we're talking about achievement,
what are we talking about?

1306
01:23:55,481 --> 01:24:00,190
I'm not just talking about I worked more
than you. I made more money than you.

1307
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:04,810
I produced more, I sold more cars and
that's not what I'm talking about.

1308
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,980
I'm talking about what, what is
your, what is your achievement? Yeah.

1309
01:24:08,050 --> 01:24:08,920
What is it you're trying to do?

1310
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:12,310
I spent a bunch of time with my
family and raised great kids. Okay.

1311
01:24:12,311 --> 01:24:15,970
That's what you want to do. Put that on
paper so you know what that looks like.

1312
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,370
Maybe there is a financial there.

1313
01:24:19,371 --> 01:24:23,260
It should be a financial aspect
to it because you need to pay,

1314
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:27,160
you need to have a roof over your head.
You need to be able to feed your kids.

1315
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:32,250
So you certainly should have a job of
vocation aspect to grading yourself.

1316
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:36,580
Are you doing what you
should be doing that work?

1317
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:39,100
Because if you're working hard at work,
guess what?

1318
01:24:39,101 --> 01:24:41,260
You're going to get promoted eventually.
Are you going to find it?

1319
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:44,050
You're going to improve your skills to a
point where you're be more valuable and

1320
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:45,730
you can go find a different
job somewhere else.

1321
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:50,110
So that's gotta be in there because if
what we allow ourselves to do is show up

1322
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:52,810
at work every day and just do what
we need to do to get by. Guess what?

1323
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:57,130
You're never leaving that job.
You'd be doing that thing forever.

1324
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:01,330
So it's physical fitness.
It's what you're eating,

1325
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:06,130
your fuel systems that you're putting
into your body. It's the family,

1326
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,450
the the,
the effort.

1327
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:12,220
What are you doing to improve
the skill sets of your children?

1328
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,133
What are you doing?

1329
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:17,710
What are you doing to improve
the skill sets of your children?

1330
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:23,340
Are you spending 20 minutes teaching them
new vocabulary words so that they can

1331
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:26,950
articulate better so they can become
a better leader when they get older?

1332
01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:30,670
Are you doing that?
Is that a big ask as a dad,

1333
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:33,850
as a mom,
are you doing,

1334
01:25:34,780 --> 01:25:39,740
have you showed them how
to escape a Dia Tiene?

1335
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,890
Have you? Maybe you should because
you can get caught. Negi team.

1336
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:47,980
That's the street fight right
street by gay teens are coming.

1337
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:51,010
So have you,

1338
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:55,150
does your kid know how to escape
of Guillotine in a street fight?

1339
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:58,690
How much is it? How long will it
take? You got to teach him today.

1340
01:25:58,691 --> 01:26:00,850
That takes 15 minutes,
but you've got to drill it.

1341
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,440
Got To drill it every day until
they kind of understand it.

1342
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,790
So what have you invested
in your kids today?

1343
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:11,840
What's the minimum standard now you
could think to yourself, well, you know,

1344
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:17,600
I got my kid an iPad for Christmas.
That was an awesome gift.

1345
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:21,950
So I'm pretty much good to go as a dad.
Right?

1346
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,190
Does your kid care about
that iPad compared to,

1347
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:28,700
are you fast forward three years where
your kid's got an incredible vocabulary

1348
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:31,130
and can defend gay teens?
Right?

1349
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:35,840
So how much have you
invested in your family?

1350
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:37,183
Yeah,

1351
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:41,220
so these are the kinds of things that we
can set a moving goalpost where you can

1352
01:26:41,221 --> 01:26:42,930
set a moving goalpost
that says, I buy, Hey,

1353
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,420
if you get your kid an iPad with
some apps on it, you're a good dad.

1354
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,550
That's a moving goalpost.
Hey, you should, hey,

1355
01:26:47,551 --> 01:26:49,680
if you can get your kid an iPad and
they can get some educational stuff,

1356
01:26:49,681 --> 01:26:53,430
you feel pretty good about
it. Cool. Good job. Is that a
moving goalpost? Yes, it is.

1357
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:57,480
Because what they really need to
know is have a better vocabulary.

1358
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,860
What they really need is interaction with
you as a human being so that they can

1359
01:27:01,861 --> 01:27:05,010
interact with other human beings in a,
in a more complete way.

1360
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:10,740
That's what we're doing. So you got
your physical, you got your okay mental,

1361
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:14,190
what are you,
how much have you read today?

1362
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:17,250
And I'm not talking about reading
somebody's freaking Instagram post.

1363
01:27:17,610 --> 01:27:20,130
That doesn't count.
Get negative credit for that.

1364
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:23,730
You're getting dumber when you do
that. Yeah. So what, what do you,

1365
01:27:23,731 --> 01:27:28,080
what are you doing? How many words
did you learn today? And by the way,

1366
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:32,430
this is brain maintenance too. Cause if
you're not trying to learn new things,

1367
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:36,870
then your brain is deteriorating
just like your body will.

1368
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:42,580
So you've got that aspect.
What about your creative output?

1369
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:48,640
What have you done in that capacity? Did
you write us? Did you draw a picture?

1370
01:27:48,641 --> 01:27:52,930
Did you write a story? Did you come up
with a guitar riff that kind of rocks,

1371
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:59,590
right? Did you, cause
you may or may not have.

1372
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:03,480
My guess is you didn't.
So how,

1373
01:28:03,490 --> 01:28:08,200
what have you done that today?
And where, and by the way,

1374
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:09,310
if you think,
oh,

1375
01:28:09,311 --> 01:28:13,150
I took a cool picture for Instagram
and I'm kind of giving myself artistic

1376
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:17,040
credit for output right there. No, no.

1377
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:19,143
So,

1378
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:22,960
and then you start looking at all this
stuff and you start adding it together.

1379
01:28:23,080 --> 01:28:25,720
Your time that you've invested in your
work and your family and your friends,

1380
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:28,900
and you're trying to try to teach your
kids something and you're trying to read

1381
01:28:28,901 --> 01:28:31,480
something and all of a sudden you look
and you say, well, I don't have much time.

1382
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:33,820
And then you look at yourself and say,
wait a second, why? Where did my time go,

1383
01:28:33,821 --> 01:28:37,300
Dick? What grade do I get today
for time management? Yeah.

1384
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:43,140
It's a big one because did I spend time
doing things that I got negative value?

1385
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,340
Nevermind break even
actually negative value.

1386
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:49,373
Yeah.

1387
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:53,990
And we don't have a grading system.
We don't know what we're aiming at.

1388
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:56,510
We don't know what the potential is
because that's what's cool about this.

1389
01:28:56,511 --> 01:28:59,660
And you, you read these definitions,
the high end, the outstanding,

1390
01:28:59,661 --> 01:29:04,260
the eminently qualified.
That is an unachievable human.

1391
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:08,460
Yeah. It's an unachievable
marine. You will not be that good.

1392
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:10,680
You cannot hold all those categories.

1393
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:15,890
But let me tell you something that is no
reason to not aspire to become the most

1394
01:29:18,421 --> 01:29:22,590
eminently qualified human being that
you can become just because it's an

1395
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:24,630
impossible path.

1396
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,020
Just because it's a
path with no end to it.

1397
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:33,120
Just because you'll never reach the
top of the mountain ever. You will not.

1398
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:36,600
You cannot.
Guess what that is.

1399
01:29:36,601 --> 01:29:41,470
No reason to stop. Guess what? Jujitsu,
you're going to get tapped out. You're,

1400
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:44,670
there's always going to be someone
that that can tap you out always.

1401
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:48,480
100% of the time, the best guys
in the world get tapped out. Yeah.

1402
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:53,730
The best guys in the world get tapped
out. Boot Chechnya, Hodra Gracie,

1403
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:56,280
which touches the best guy in the world.
What happens?

1404
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:00,960
He goes in GE and loses to Gracie.

1405
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:05,550
Tapped out. Submitted. Why
is that? Because somebody is
always, and what happened?

1406
01:30:05,551 --> 01:30:09,540
Roger Gracie, by the way, when he
fought Tim Kennedy, he got beat down.

1407
01:30:10,650 --> 01:30:13,500
So there's always, you're never going
to get to the top of the mountain,

1408
01:30:13,501 --> 01:30:17,970
but that is not theirs.
That is not a reason to,

1409
01:30:17,971 --> 01:30:20,520
not to stop climbing.

1410
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:24,090
Just because you're not going to reach
the top of the mountain doesn't mean you

1411
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:28,830
stop climbing. No, actually you climb
Harger you see where you can get,

1412
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:32,340
but if you don't know
what you're climbing,

1413
01:30:33,810 --> 01:30:37,290
if you don't understand the mountain,
if you can't see the summit,

1414
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:39,660
you don't know where to climb.
And then you just look around and gone,

1415
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:42,930
well I might as well just slide
down because it, it, it, it's,

1416
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:47,100
it takes physical and mental
exertion to move up the mountain.

1417
01:30:47,130 --> 01:30:48,840
And if I don't even know where the top is,
I'm just going to,

1418
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:51,540
I can't tell where I am. I can't tell
him from them halfway up the mountain,

1419
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,930
the quarter with the mountain, I can't
tell from close to the top, bottom,

1420
01:30:53,931 --> 01:30:54,764
top and can't tell.

1421
01:30:55,410 --> 01:30:57,750
So there's enough reason for me
just to sit around and do nothing.

1422
01:30:57,930 --> 01:31:02,640
Break out the donuts,
not the,

1423
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:06,260
okay. So the way you
started this was, was, um,

1424
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:10,490
with your navy experience as far
as evaluations go and it, okay.

1425
01:31:10,491 --> 01:31:11,870
So this is essentially what it would,

1426
01:31:11,871 --> 01:31:14,570
it kind of translated to
me what it was in the navy.

1427
01:31:14,571 --> 01:31:17,860
The one that you were talking about was
like everyone expected to get the, the,

1428
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:21,670
the perfect score. Right. And that was
sort of the standard. And then the,

1429
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:24,040
in the Marine Corps one, it's
kind of the opposite. Well No,

1430
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,480
the navy ones started on
when I first got in the navy,

1431
01:31:26,570 --> 01:31:30,650
basically everyone was a 4.0 and then
they changed it because you need to force

1432
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:33,950
rank. And I dunno when the Marine Corps
or if they made that change, but it,

1433
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:36,560
but they did because that's the way it
is now. They're forced ranked for sure.

1434
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:37,641
Okay.
So the,

1435
01:31:37,641 --> 01:31:41,990
and the point is just the
two different standards,

1436
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,640
like common like standards,
right. You know, when,

1437
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:48,290
cause you get this in other
places too where it's like,
oh, you know, it's just, uh,

1438
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:52,280
just your, here's your quarterly
evaluation and I just put force, you know,

1439
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:54,530
cause I don't have any complaints
about you kind of thing.

1440
01:31:54,890 --> 01:31:58,130
It doesn't necessarily reflect how
dope you really are. It's just,

1441
01:31:58,150 --> 01:32:03,070
I don't horny how dope you could be. Yes,
exactly right. So it's just more of like,

1442
01:32:03,071 --> 01:32:03,820
okay,

1443
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:08,820
so the ceiling is pretty low is what it
is by like a common like perception as

1444
01:32:09,281 --> 01:32:12,070
far as the standard goes. Then you gotta
have the opposite where it's like, oh,

1445
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:16,150
we all know no one's going to get a five.
Like we all just know that. So we're,

1446
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:18,370
we're just kind of doing the
best we can kind of thing.

1447
01:32:18,510 --> 01:32:23,170
And in that way is better up for obvious
reasons. But at the end of the day,

1448
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:24,460
it's like when you say,
Oh yeah,

1449
01:32:24,461 --> 01:32:27,610
you can literally be like you're topping
out because as you get better and

1450
01:32:27,611 --> 01:32:31,900
better, it's harder to get
better and better. Yes. So if,

1451
01:32:31,930 --> 01:32:34,270
but you won't even get
to those upper levels.

1452
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:38,310
If that ceiling was so low and you're
ripping four is all day, they're all year,

1453
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:42,790
whatever. Man. I used to, um, he used
to play his game. Super Mario brothers.

1454
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:45,740
You ever heard of that supermarket?

1455
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:52,610
I've ever played one single second
of that particular video game.

1456
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:54,610
All right. Dang Bell. Okay.

1457
01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:58,870
I played halo one time for about three
minutes with some of the guys that was in

1458
01:32:58,871 --> 01:32:59,704
my seal platoon.

1459
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:04,000
And then I just think it
was after thought it was a,

1460
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:07,200
they were really good at it. They
murdered me a bunch of different ways.

1461
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,000
Then I said, well, this is
stupid. It's a video game.

1462
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:13,600
I don't care who wants to go
grapple. Yeah, well that part is,

1463
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:18,610
I would say that that's true, but this
the, the point still is consistent.

1464
01:33:18,611 --> 01:33:21,940
So Super Mario brothers. It's
okay. See, it's Super Mario.

1465
01:33:21,941 --> 01:33:24,960
There's a bunch of Mario brothers.
This one is, this is more,

1466
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:29,470
this one is called Super Mario brothers
original Nintendo entertainment system

1467
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:33,220
here. I don't want to
say 1,904 old school.

1468
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:38,590
So Super Mario Brothers had four
worlds, uh, sorry, eight worlds,

1469
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:42,340
four levels each world.
So 32 levels.

1470
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:49,180
And you have an opportunity at various
points in some levels to hit the warp,

1471
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:52,720
like the warp zone. So He'd go down a
pipe in, it skips like all these levels,

1472
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:57,520
right? So you could see, you
could essentially get through
the game in maybe like,

1473
01:33:57,521 --> 01:34:00,580
I don't know, six or eight
levels. Okay. If you worked right,

1474
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:04,660
but if you chose not to work, you
would have to go through all 32 levels.

1475
01:34:04,661 --> 01:34:08,890
So I used to be able to
go through all 32 levels,

1476
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:12,820
never dying one single time. Like
I got really, really good at that.

1477
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:17,470
You're for those either just listening
and not seeing this on video echo looks

1478
01:34:17,471 --> 01:34:19,540
super proud of that last statement.

1479
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:23,350
I mean I was a little bit embarrassed
for him, but it's cool anyway. Okay,

1480
01:34:23,380 --> 01:34:25,900
32 levels.
Here's why.

1481
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:28,810
Here's why that's significant though
as far as Super Mario brothers goes,

1482
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:30,970
because you can easily pass the game,

1483
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:35,590
save the princess by just
warping and it's still real hard.

1484
01:34:35,591 --> 01:34:36,660
But you, you gotta, you know,

1485
01:34:36,670 --> 01:34:39,640
you only go through a few levels compared
to if you go through all the levels

1486
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:44,200
voluntarily, right? So once you
save the princess by working,

1487
01:34:44,201 --> 01:34:46,090
it's like cool, now you've got
to go through all the levels.

1488
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:48,070
But if you can do that without dying,

1489
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,770
that's like that's super high level,
right?

1490
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:56,800
As far as Super Mario brothers goes. So
it's basically, so what's your points?

1491
01:34:56,801 --> 01:35:00,020
So go to this two standards,
go back to the two standards.

1492
01:35:00,050 --> 01:35:01,430
If you go for the stand it's like oh yeah,

1493
01:35:01,431 --> 01:35:04,010
everyone gets a kind
of a 4.0 kind of thing.

1494
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:08,990
That's like passing the passing of the
game by warping. It's true. Like man,

1495
01:35:08,991 --> 01:35:11,180
you passed the game in one man.
Damn that's good.

1496
01:35:11,181 --> 01:35:14,210
That's good by any standard really.
You know I can't complain about that.

1497
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:19,040
But you've got to open up the standard
little bit more go through all 32 levels,

1498
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:22,400
men without dying. Then you do it
as quick as you can kind of thing.

1499
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,590
And if that standard kind
of allows for all that,

1500
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:26,600
where you can't reach
the top a little bit,

1501
01:35:26,601 --> 01:35:29,600
like the standard isn't saving the
princess standard is like something way

1502
01:35:29,601 --> 01:35:30,620
greater.
You see what I'm saying?

1503
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,820
So it allows you to get better
and be evaluated on that,

1504
01:35:34,821 --> 01:35:39,320
on that elevation while still not
like capping out at a certain level.

1505
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,130
You see what I'm saying?
Switch.

1506
01:35:41,131 --> 01:35:45,880
You got to do as far as the evaluation
process goes. Okay Bro. I'm telling you,

1507
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,350
I'm telling you, look to Supermarine
there's this thing they discovered.

1508
01:35:51,351 --> 01:35:54,740
He was like a glitch in the game where
you could like go to this one level and

1509
01:35:54,741 --> 01:35:58,490
do this thing with a turtle shell and
keep jumping on it and get like a thousand

1510
01:35:58,491 --> 01:36:01,970
men, which is kind of a
step backwards in a way.

1511
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,810
But that's just a side note
day.

1512
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:12,350
Okay. How much time have you
spent playing video games? Well,

1513
01:36:12,400 --> 01:36:14,140
and what you could've done with your life.
Yeah.

1514
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:18,730
Well keep in mind that guitar
you could have played, you know,

1515
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:22,190
instruments could have mastered chess.

1516
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,910
You could have spoken another language
instead of you're over here talking about

1517
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:30,650
how you did 32 levels in one
minute. By the way, this is it.

1518
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:34,310
This gets you a really low grade.
We'll come up with a system.

1519
01:36:34,730 --> 01:36:38,840
Your grade is going to be the low. Yes. As
far as achievements goes, yes, very low.

1520
01:36:38,870 --> 01:36:43,700
But as far as an evaluation process, did
all that translated highly respect you?

1521
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:48,510
I did g Charles go dang
man. Did He Kinda, yeah,

1522
01:36:48,530 --> 01:36:51,900
sometimes there you go with it.
That you finally got that respect too.

1523
01:36:51,901 --> 01:36:54,710
You want and from that side,
Mario Bros in fifth grade by the way.

1524
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:57,700
So you know a little bit different.
Was that a humble brag?

1525
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:01,230
Like I did 32 levels by the way.
I saw me in fifth grade. No,

1526
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:03,050
I think it was more of
an aging thing actually.

1527
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:06,380
That wasn't a break at all because in
fifth grade you could have been learning

1528
01:37:06,381 --> 01:37:10,220
the language. Yes sir. Yeah, we're
doing pull ups were actually,

1529
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:13,040
it was doing pull ups in fifth
grade. That's legit. Yeah. Big Time.

1530
01:37:13,490 --> 01:37:17,810
I thought the check. Well,
okay, here's the bottom line.
We are looking to step up.

1531
01:37:17,811 --> 01:37:19,250
We are looking at to,

1532
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,300
to become better,

1533
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:27,320
truly better. So what do
you got for us? How can you,

1534
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:31,910
how can you help us get better?
Yeah. To stay in the past. So,

1535
01:37:31,911 --> 01:37:35,210
and actually that brings up a good
point because we're on the path,

1536
01:37:35,211 --> 01:37:38,230
quote unquote right,
you whatever,

1537
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:41,390
all on the path and saying we're even
saying we're on the past straight up

1538
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:46,220
saying, but like what is the path though?
I mean, sure, there's some things,

1539
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:49,100
you know, we can go through it and
you did too of course as part of it,

1540
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:52,160
but you don't have any evaluation kind
of standard is what you say it. So yeah,

1541
01:37:52,161 --> 01:37:55,500
I think that'll be how actually I'm
really looking forward to it to be honest

1542
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:59,760
with you. Yeah. And the last digit. So
yes, that's on the path. Here's the, okay,

1543
01:37:59,761 --> 01:38:02,430
so this will help us prep then.
At the very least,

1544
01:38:02,431 --> 01:38:06,480
prepare to be officially on the
path and be evaluated the same time.

1545
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:10,200
Get jiggy, right. Step one kitty Geek.

1546
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:13,410
Step one,
be get a rash guard.

1547
01:38:13,411 --> 01:38:16,830
So where do we get our gies and get her
keys from origin or [inaudible] dot com

1548
01:38:16,831 --> 01:38:20,590
best cheese in the world. Factually.
Actually the new rift is an hour.

1549
01:38:20,591 --> 01:38:25,591
So let's just live re this is like when
you put it Rifkey on and then go back to

1550
01:38:27,991 --> 01:38:31,610
your old geezers. Like I said
this before, this is a nonstarter.

1551
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:34,710
You're going to be mad at your old gay,
you're going to be Trey, your old g.

1552
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:40,040
You're going to wonder why anyone ever
made a ghee like they used to make them,

1553
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,580
but then again, then you're
going to, then if you choose,

1554
01:38:44,581 --> 01:38:48,750
you can revisit or you can visit that
video that Pete put out about like,

1555
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:51,240
you know, made and like all
this stuff. It's like, oh, okay.

1556
01:38:51,241 --> 01:38:54,500
That's why they didn't make it because
what they went through to make it. Yeah.

1557
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:57,300
You know, not, not everyone's
[inaudible] as usual,

1558
01:38:57,301 --> 01:39:01,260
we are standing on the shoulders of
giants because you always look at the way

1559
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:04,530
things have evolved and you have
to take those iterative steps.

1560
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:09,420
No one just thinks of
the iPhone,

1561
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:10,410
right?

1562
01:39:10,410 --> 01:39:14,880
Somebody had to make a bunch of other
phones before that and then even consider

1563
01:39:14,881 --> 01:39:19,020
iPhone like right now. Like what is the
newest one? I dunno, x or something.

1564
01:39:19,021 --> 01:39:22,990
Something. 10 x is the tent
and you know, Roman numerals.

1565
01:39:23,050 --> 01:39:24,870
I guess I didn't know that at first.
Anyway,

1566
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:30,590
the one in six years from now is going
to make this x ten one you'd be like,

1567
01:39:30,931 --> 01:39:33,000
oh, it's the old school. You know,

1568
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:37,860
like not unevolved neanderthal one.
That's what going to feel like.

1569
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:40,320
That's what your old g will feel like.
Yes.

1570
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:44,820
A Non Neanderthal Geeky and you
put it on the rift. Oh yeah.

1571
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,230
So you should get done. You can get
the gies, you can get the rash guards,

1572
01:39:49,231 --> 01:39:52,680
she can get other clothing do.
You can also get supplements,

1573
01:39:52,740 --> 01:39:57,330
which right now I am taking a ton of
joint warfare. Yeah, I hurt my knee,

1574
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:02,850
which is not that big of a deal cause
let's face it, I'm walking around,

1575
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:05,540
you know we're going to be fine.
It's not that big of a deal.

1576
01:40:05,541 --> 01:40:08,490
I don't want people to feel like,
oh no, what happened? Don't worry.

1577
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:09,840
Everything is fine.

1578
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:15,440
I did however up the joint warfare
and continue the Krill oil path,

1579
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,900
but the g the joint warfare,
you can feel it in there,

1580
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:26,670
can feel it like little micro nano
robots in there repairing stuff.

1581
01:40:27,210 --> 01:40:31,890
Now you have to, you know, I know
what happened with your Bicep,

1582
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:36,090
but the last time I hurt my
other knee it was a disaster.

1583
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:38,790
And this one is already.

1584
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:44,190
So you guys get your joint warfare.
I remember you. Well, I mean,

1585
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:48,180
of course I remember it because it was
as recent as today where you're like

1586
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:52,830
around like Wolverine. But I'm like, yeah,

1587
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,950
well I dig it.

1588
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,910
It's probably the joint warfare but
has to, something to do with it.

1589
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,510
But also there's some,
there's definitely,

1590
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:06,130
I definitely have been blessed
with some sort of uh, ability to,

1591
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:10,990
to heal up a little quicker.
Thank thankfully, knock on wood,

1592
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,400
that's what it seems like to me.

1593
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:17,850
Well also we have moke which is additional
protein that happens to be delicious

1594
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:22,450
and taste like a dessert straight up.
It's the way it goes with that also.

1595
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:28,210
Where are you kidding? Mock. Same deal
just for the kids in the same deal,

1596
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:30,130
but they have strawberry or your kid milk,

1597
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:34,070
which is literally the best tasting
thing in the world. Yeah. Uh,

1598
01:41:34,410 --> 01:41:37,960
that has strawberry flavor cause men
is still my favorite and we do have

1599
01:41:37,961 --> 01:41:40,420
strawberry adult milk coming out.

1600
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:45,160
It need that and it is ridiculous.

1601
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:47,650
What is t and d test and evaluate.
Oh,

1602
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,150
so I got the little package in
the mail and it was so good.

1603
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:55,480
So yeah, you can get that.
You know, also discipline

1604
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,390
and discipline go.

1605
01:41:58,420 --> 01:42:03,420
So discipline if you are going to train
Jujitsu or you're going to do something

1606
01:42:04,301 --> 01:42:09,301
that's going to require physical output
and at the same time mental alertness.

1607
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:10,593
So that's,

1608
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:15,630
for me it was always about hey pre mission
cause it when you're on a mission you

1609
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:18,790
have to be physically ready and
you have to be mentally ready.

1610
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:22,960
You need a both aspects.

1611
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:26,500
And so that's why we made disciplines
or you're ready for those things.

1612
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,630
And then also we have discipline go,
which is a,

1613
01:42:31,660 --> 01:42:32,860
which is a capsule.

1614
01:42:32,861 --> 01:42:37,030
And the reason I made this is because
sometimes I'm going to speak or I'm going

1615
01:42:37,031 --> 01:42:40,330
to work with a company or I'm going to
be in a board room all day and I want to

1616
01:42:40,331 --> 01:42:42,000
bring my a game.
Sure.

1617
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:48,900
And I don't want to have to drink a whole
beverage because I don't don't need it

1618
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:52,120
at that time. So I talked
to Pete, Brian, we took the,

1619
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:56,560
the elements from discipline drink,

1620
01:42:56,920 --> 01:43:01,330
put them into the capsule is that
way if you need to bring your a game,

1621
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:07,470
you can get your discipline go and that
will get you across the board and some

1622
01:43:08,441 --> 01:43:12,430
will a little bit of Jocko white
tea look good in the original,

1623
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:17,260
the original tea that Jellco was into.
Yeah,

1624
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:22,030
just kind of a white tea. It's you
know, at first but not sort of a stable,

1625
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:26,110
it's like synonymous, you know
Jocko white tea. Yeah. It's just,

1626
01:43:26,111 --> 01:43:28,150
it's synonymous with good taste.

1627
01:43:28,151 --> 01:43:32,200
It's synonymous with 800 pound deadlift.

1628
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:35,650
So there's that big time.

1629
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:40,830
Also the t is available at Jocko
store cause yes Jocko has a store,

1630
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:44,350
which we already know but that's a good
place to visit to stay in the game to

1631
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:48,610
represent while you're in the game.
So if you want t shirts,

1632
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:51,380
we got some lightweight hoodies rolling,
rocking and rolling.

1633
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:55,760
A lot of good evaluations.
No comment.

1634
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:59,540
Yeah cause you haven't put one on
yet because you haven't given me one.

1635
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:02,360
Well you know, let's face it,
you kind of deserved that one.

1636
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:07,420
And it's also changing minds of people
who were originally weren't really assign

1637
01:44:09,810 --> 01:44:14,210
special forces over here.
Psyops you know what? Hey,

1638
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:17,300
the truth be told they
came out really good.

1639
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,250
Just even like the fit the design cat
on the other night. Yes. There it is.

1640
01:44:22,280 --> 01:44:25,460
One of them. There's two for
this too. Okay. That's right.

1641
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:30,650
You can get truckers hats. Yup.
Patches on their watch or other stuff.

1642
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,690
Yeah, a bunch of cool. Sorry. Yeah.

1643
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:35,330
If you want to duck store.com if you want
to represent while you're on the path

1644
01:44:35,331 --> 01:44:39,140
while you're being evaluated, that
might even be one of the evaluation, uh,

1645
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:43,790
scenarios. Your uniform. Come on

1646
01:44:46,610 --> 01:44:49,940
anyway. I guess if someone's
just a complete Slob, yeah.

1647
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:54,110
Then maybe they do need to step
it up. Somebody. Yeah. Okay.

1648
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,350
Maybe uniform will be judged,
but I doubt it. Well, okay.

1649
01:44:57,380 --> 01:45:00,590
Well what be wearing a stinky
geezer though. Oh yeah, no, that's,

1650
01:45:00,591 --> 01:45:03,590
that's a uniform violation.
Big Time. Yes sir. Oh,

1651
01:45:03,591 --> 01:45:08,140
you didn't want to wash your g so now
we all have to suffer. Yeah. Yeah.

1652
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:11,390
You're going to get punished.
What of don't do that. Hey,

1653
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:16,040
the Rifkey the cool thing you can
watch with your normal clothes. Yeah,

1654
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,230
because it's, and it'll
dry. It's just not,

1655
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:23,260
it's not like when you put a regular g
in and it's like you threw a 40 pound

1656
01:45:24,471 --> 01:45:29,110
weight washing receipt and go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1657
01:45:29,970 --> 01:45:34,520
Yeah. Yeah cause it all bunch of, that's
all. And it takes nine hours to dry.

1658
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:37,580
Not the rift. A rift drives with your
normal like quick dry tee shirts.

1659
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:42,200
Just about, did you see the video Pete
head when he's like going into the fibers?

1660
01:45:42,201 --> 01:45:45,140
Like he takes care of one fiber and it's
like breaking in and it's hard to break.

1661
01:45:45,141 --> 01:45:48,810
He puts the two and you can't even
break it. The whole g is that, yeah,

1662
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:51,490
it's good man. Real good. Oh,

from a buddy who said he had a,

1676
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,080
this is going into the book,

1677
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:44,350
but he had a nephew who had been
through a rough time and 10 years old,

1678
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:50,690
got in the warrior kid book, Boom
Warrior kid who he's like, Hey,

1679
01:46:50,700 --> 01:46:55,700
there's that book completely changed the
trajectory of my nephew's life and it

1680
01:46:59,221 --> 01:47:00,240
doesn't get much better than that,

1681
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:04,080
but the warrior kicked podcasts has
the same messages in a podcast format.

1682
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:07,530
So check that out. And also while you're
there, you can check out some of that.

1683

Irish oaks ranch.com where we have
a warrior kid that is making soap,

1684
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:18,351
started a business making soap on his
farm from goat milk and that goat milk

1685
01:47:20,251 --> 01:47:24,330
will help you stay clean and clean. My
daughter has a question for oncologists.

1686
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:27,610
Oh, okay, cool. I'll send it to him.
He said the double take, you know,

1687
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:32,340
we'll get that sorted. Might also
youtube. We have a youtube channel.

1688
01:47:32,370 --> 01:47:36,570
If you're interested in the video
version of this podcast to see what Jocko

1689
01:47:36,571 --> 01:47:40,500

1690
01:47:40,590 --> 01:47:41,250
that's where you go.

1691
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:46,090
There's also some of echoes legit videos
on there that he calls legit videos.

1692
01:47:46,110 --> 01:47:49,410
He feels good about it, feels really
good about them and just like,

1693
01:47:49,411 --> 01:47:51,990
he feels good about
guiding through 32 levels.

1694
01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:58,320
Uh, yeah. Kind of. Yeah. Sometimes I
think we've got psychological warfare.

1695
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:01,290
If you need a little, everyone
that looks for an alarm that says,

1696
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:03,510
oh really be great to have an alarm,
but chuck, we'll make an alarm.

1697
01:48:03,511 --> 01:48:07,290
That's the alarm. Psychological warfare.
It's on iTunes, Google play MP3 platforms.

1698
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:09,120
And not only will it wake
you up in the morning,

1699
01:48:09,300 --> 01:48:12,030
but if you're having a moment of
weakness because you want to eat a donut,

1700
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:17,130
this will 100% effective. Stop you
from eating a donut. Press play,

1701
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:22,020
psychological warfare. Check it
out. Also flip side canvases.

1702
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:23,850
My brother Dakota Meyer,

1703
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:27,120
you heard him on this podcast number one
15 if you haven't listened that podcast,

1704
01:48:27,121 --> 01:48:27,960
just go listen to it.

1705
01:48:27,961 --> 01:48:31,080
Give yourself about four hours
cause it's long and it's heavy,

1706
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:36,470
but he's got a company where he's putting
images on to various forms of canvas

1707
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:40,320
of nylon or what does it,
vinyl,

1708
01:48:40,321 --> 01:48:43,830
vinyl and you can take these things and
that way these are kinds of things you

1709
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:47,700
can put up in your house where you look
at it and you get that little extra

1710
01:48:47,701 --> 01:48:52,701

01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,640
that's a one that's
book one the next book,

1721
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:33,840
it's same series called Mark's mission
and then there's the third book in the

1722
01:49:33,841 --> 01:49:38,370
series, which is called way the
warrior kid where there's a will.

1723

1725
01:49:45,690 --> 01:49:50,680
That way I can print enough copies for
everyone that's called the big preordered

1726
01:49:50,681 --> 01:49:54,400
that I used to make fun of my publisher.
But guess who the publisher is now me,

1727
01:49:54,460 --> 01:49:58,300
so I have to know how many to print.
So if you want it,

come out May 28th so there you go.

1729

Also,
we have Mikey and the dragons.

1730
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:09,820
This is a book to help kids
figure out how to overcome fear.

1731
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,110
Sure your kids could lead.

1732
01:50:11,111 --> 01:50:14,530
Read some book where you could read some
book to your little kid that's about

1733
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:17,440
things that don't matter in the world.

1734
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:21,340
Or You could read them a book that helps
them actually learn how to overcome

1735
01:50:21,341 --> 01:50:25,270
their fears. That's Mikey and the
dragons. Great Story. Awesome art.

1736
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:29,590
Very awesome. Yes. The discipline
equals freedom field manual.

1737
01:50:30,910 --> 01:50:35,380
Give the gift of discipline.
That's, that's all there is to say.

1738
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:38,740
It's the book that's going
to show people that you,

1739
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:43,810
it's going to show people the path.
If you want that on audio form,

1740
01:50:43,811 --> 01:50:46,840
then that's not on audible.
It's on iTunes, Amazon music,

1741
01:50:46,841 --> 01:50:50,500
Google play and other MP three platforms.
Then you've got extreme ownership,

1742
01:50:50,501 --> 01:50:54,490
which I wrote with my brother Leif Babin
where we took the leadership lessons we

1743
01:50:54,491 --> 01:50:58,630
learned on the battlefield and explain
how those can be applied to your business

1744
01:50:58,631 --> 01:50:58,991
and life,

1745
01:50:58,991 --> 01:51:03,520
and one of those lessons in that book
is called the dichotomy of leadership.

1746
01:51:04,270 --> 01:51:07,990
The dichotomy of leadership seem to be,
as we continue to work with businesses,

1747
01:51:07,991 --> 01:51:10,150
companies,
leaders around the world,

1748
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:14,500
we found that the biggest problem that
they had was balancing the dichotomy of

1749
01:51:14,501 --> 01:51:18,850
leadership and when you can't
balance the dichotomy of leadership,

1750
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:21,550
the multiple dichotomies of leadership,
when you can't balance them,

1751
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:23,680
they derail your whole team.

1752
01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:29,470
So get extreme ownership and get yourself
the dichotomy of leadership so that

1753
01:51:29,471 --> 01:51:33,760
you can understand how to truly apply
these things effectively. Echelon Front,

1754
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:38,290

1761

up,

1762
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:10,420
Chicago 23rd and 24th we haven't
pulled the sold out switch yet,

then December 4th and fifth and Sydney

1766
01:52:22,420 --> 01:52:25,090
extreme ownership.com
if you want to register,

1767
01:52:25,091 --> 01:52:30,091
do it quickly because all of them
are going to sell out eff online.

1768
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:34,390
This is for those that can't make it to
a muster or you can't bring your whole

1769
01:52:34,391 --> 01:52:38,950
company to a muster because it's
expensive. That's why we made e f online.

1770
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:42,280
This is online interactive
leadership training.

1771
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:47,360
It's me and it's everyone on
the echelon front team training,

1772
01:52:47,361 --> 01:52:51,410
leadership through technology.
It's,

1773
01:52:51,470 --> 01:52:53,540
it's available direct to consumer.

1774
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:56,330
If you're just one person you want to
get in the game or you've got a company

1775
01:52:56,460 --> 01:53:00,950
and you can get it through enterprise,
but if you want to check it out,

1776
01:53:01,010 --> 01:53:06,010
go to e f online.com and of course on
top of that we have e f Overwatch where

1777
01:53:06,201 --> 01:53:08,830
we're taking
leaders,

1778
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:13,510
proven leaders from SPEC ops and
from combat aviation, putting them,

1779
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:16,840
placing them into companies
in the civilian sector.

1780
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:22,440
Don't always hire someone based just
because they have experienced in a field,

1781
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:26,640
actually hire them for their leadership
capability because it is a lot easier to

1782
01:53:26,641 --> 01:53:31,641
teach someone an industry than it
is to teach someone leadership.

1783
01:53:33,060 --> 01:53:36,870
So get yourself a qualified,
proven leader.

1784
01:53:37,620 --> 01:53:38,221
Go to F,

1785
01:53:38,221 --> 01:53:43,221

1786

satisfied with 500 hours of us on this

1787
01:53:49,921 --> 01:53:54,630
podcast. Well then we are on the
interwebs, we are on Twitter,

1788
01:53:54,631 --> 01:53:58,180
we are on Instagram and
of course we are on dad.

1789
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:03,340
They see walk de Boer Echo is that Echo
Charles and I am at jockowillink and

1790
01:54:04,981 --> 01:54:09,000
thanks to all the people that
make this podcast possible.

1791
01:54:09,030 --> 01:54:13,620
And by that I mean not
some big corporate sponsor.

1792
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:18,060
By that I mean our police,
our military,

1793
01:54:18,120 --> 01:54:22,830
our law enforcement, our firefighters,
paramedics, EMT dispatchers,

1794
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:26,220
correctional officer's border
patrol and yes, secret service.

1795
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:30,600
All you first responders,
all you in uniform,

1796
01:54:30,601 --> 01:54:34,110
your service and your
sacrifice allow us to live,

1797
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:39,550
to live a life of liberty
and the pursuit of happiness,

1798
01:54:39,551 --> 01:54:42,250
which is what we're doing here.
And everyone else out there,

1799
01:54:44,440 --> 01:54:49,210
check yourself,
evaluate yourself honestly,

1800
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:53,860
are you doing what you
can do to be better,

1801
01:54:55,810 --> 01:55:00,450
pretty working as hard as you can and
that just doesn't mean work as in your

1802
01:55:00,451 --> 01:55:01,890
vocation or your job.

1803
01:55:01,891 --> 01:55:06,870
Are you working to be a better
father or mother or daughter or son?

1804
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:11,660
Argue, maximizing
opportunities. And again,

1805
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:15,650
not just professional opportunities,
but opportunities to help someone,

1806
01:55:16,940 --> 01:55:20,840
to teach someone, to coach someone
to make someone else better.

1807
01:55:22,260 --> 01:55:22,770
Yeah.

1808
01:55:22,770 --> 01:55:26,160
Are you maximizing the opportunities
to spend time with your family to

1809
01:55:26,161 --> 01:55:29,070
strengthen the relationships you have?

1810
01:55:30,730 --> 01:55:32,650
Are you maximizing the opportunities too?

1811
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:36,250
Make the members of your family better?

1812
01:55:37,470 --> 01:55:38,303
Yeah.

1813
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,800
Are you every day doing everything you
can to live the most eminent we worthy

1814
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:50,100
life you can live.
Ask yourself those questions

1815
01:55:52,390 --> 01:55:57,190
and when you realize that you fall short,
that we all fall short.

1816
01:55:57,191 --> 01:55:58,480
When you realize that,

1817
01:55:58,870 --> 01:56:03,870
then get yourself on the path to correct
those shortfalls by going out there

1818
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:09,230
and getting after it.

1819
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:16,080
And until next time,
this is echo and Jocko.

1820
01:56:17,090 --> 01:56:17,140
Okay.
