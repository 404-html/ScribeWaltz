00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,590
This is Jocko podcast number
one 59 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,560
Jocko Willink. Good evening. Good evening.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,893
Okay.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,090
There's a

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,410
a terrible feeling in the
gut that I've only felt

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:28,210
while I was overseas in Iraq,

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,493
and it's,

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:35,370
it's this deeply distressed
kind of sick feeling

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,850
and it literally feel it in your gut.
Literally feel it in your stomach,

10
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:47,660
in my stomach. And it's not.
It's not the fear. It's not fear.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,930
It's not.
It's not the fear of death.

12
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,910
Because when you get to a point,

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,630
when you kind of accept that death is
a possibility and you're okay with it,

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,320
then that fear kind of goes away.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,860
And it's not the fear of one of
your guys being wounded to kill.

16
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:18,190
It's not that either,
because even that fear,

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,680
even that fear you,
you,

18
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:25,681
you kind of get a control of that fear
because you know you can't dwell on it

19
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:26,531
because you know,

20
00:01:26,531 --> 00:01:31,300
if you dwell on the fear of one of your
guys getting wounded or getting killed,

21
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,710
then that's going to detract from the
very thing that you're supposed to be

22
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:40,660
doing. That will most likely prevent
your guys from being wounded or killed.

23
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,770
If you're dwelling on that fear,

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,610
you won't be doing the things you should
be doing like planning and training and

25
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:50,970
preparing and inspecting
and reviewing and leading.

26
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,270
So even that fear,

27
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,170
wallets persistent and heavy and potent,

28
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,480
it's you have some level
of control over it.

29
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,463
But

30
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,820
when something goes wrong,

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,910
when something happens

32
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,293
and

33
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,070
you're responsible and the burden of
command settles down with its mantra,

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,220
mantras,

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,220
monstrous weight on top of your shoulders
because there's no one else to blame.

36
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,000
That's what I'm talking about.
It actually,

37
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,060
I felt it for the first time really a
little bit during my first deployment that

38
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:42,960
I did to Iraq and my platoon, we,
we did what we were supposed to do.

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,390
Some things didn't go right now,
nothing crazy,

40
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:53,391
but mistakes were made and it was actually
back to back to back missions with

41
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,730
related targets that we're going after.

42
00:02:56,731 --> 00:03:01,150
And I was the assault force commander
and I think one of my might've even been

43
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,260
the ground force commander.

44
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:06,820
So I was clearly responsible for these
missions and there were some mistakes

45
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:07,654
made.
And

46
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,890
my commanding officer came
and spoke to me about it,

47
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,410
you know,

48
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,410
pulled me aside to point out the mistakes
and the resulting impacts that these

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,140
mistakes we're going to have. And
he wasn't happy. I mean he wasn't,

50
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,770
he wasn't mad because we had a good
relationship and he was talking to me just

51
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,310
straight,
but he wasn't happy.

52
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,740
And you know, I kept a calm face
and I took ownership and said,

53
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,260
hey my fault, this is the things
we're going to do to fix it. You know.

54
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,820
But even though I kind of kept a calm
face in front of him when he left eye

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,770
again, I felt like this retching in my
stomach debt that I had made some kind of

56
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:55,030
mistake. And, and one of the worst things
about it is there's nothing you can do.

57
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:58,210
Like the mistake happened. You
can't go back, you can't fix it.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,220
And I can't compare that feeling to
anything else really that I've felt cause

59
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,300
cause I've never felt anything else
that feels like that. And I've,

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,520
I've talked about it with my friends
and leadership positions overseas and,

61
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:18,170
and like, actually the first time, uh,

62
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,320
it was actually stoner that
talked to me about this,

63
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,380
this gut feeling and he had
something going on and you know,

64
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,280
he's like, he's like, you know, that
feeling? And I was like, Oh yeah,

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,050
I know that feeling. And
like I said, I've never,

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,420
I've never felt this feeling,

67
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:40,750
this gnawing feeling in your gut
that's eating you from the inside.

68
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,020
I think you see it sometimes.
Um,

69
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,480
if you watch,
you know,

70
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:51,481
some movies try and capture this feeling
of where it's basically where someone's

71
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,800
life is falling apart,

72
00:04:53,801 --> 00:04:57,670
but they're trying to keep up a facade
up that everything's going okay.

73
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,970
Have you ever seen the movie Fargo?
No. Okay. I got you on this one.

74
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,560
This movie Fargo.
There's a guy and he's,

75
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,970
he's a car salesman and he's been
fudging the numbers and then he's,

76
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,120
he's,
he's trying to kill someone.

77
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,230
There's all these things are happening and
it's all, and he's a very, I would say,

78
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,580
a very naive person.

79
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,060
And he's married and he's got kids and
he's trying to do this stuff that's not

80
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:29,800
right and he knows it and it's starting
to come apart and that that's the kind

81
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,430
of thing we, you can see it's
just eating him from the inside.

82
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,400
So I think it's that,

83
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:40,060
that type of gnawing deep feeling where
everything is going wrong and there's

84
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:44,420
nothing you can do about it. That's the,
that's the closest I, I think I can call,

85
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,430
is it just when things are going so wrong
and there's nothing you can do about

86
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,310
it?
And I think that that feeling,

87
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,720
that feeling for me, I think
that's why, number one,

88
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:57,620
that's why I always
say combat is humbling.

89
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,510
It's because of that feeling right
there where you, something went wrong.

90
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:05,420
You couldn't stop it, you couldn't
control it, you can't fix it.

91
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:08,510
It is what it is and

92
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,200
okay,

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,380
that makes it humbling.
Extremely humbling.

94
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,890
And because of that,

95
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,890
it made me want to make sure that I did
everything humanly possible to prevent

96
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:29,060
from that, to prevent that feeling
from grabbing hold of me again. If,

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,480
if I could help it. It opened
up my mind. It made me,

98
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,780
it made me always want to
listen to other people's input.

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,950
Cause I always said to myself, wait, if
I didn't see what was going on over here,

100
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,530
how do I ever know where
my blind spots are?

101
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,090
I always think I must have blind spots
somewhere. There must be something.

102
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,050
I see something I don't understand.
How can I listen?

103
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,220
I need to make sure I listen to other
people's viewpoints and perspectives so

104
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:01,670
that I don't, so I can
cover and, and yeah.

105
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,450
Covers many blind spots as possible.
Hmm.

106
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,510
Review other methods and other ideas
and other principals to see what I could

107
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:16,340
learn from them. And when people
raise opposing points to me,

108
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:20,730
I don't object to them.
I don't bristle up and it's,

109
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,080
I, it doesn't offend me when
somebody says something that isn't,

110
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,530
that I don't agree with. It
doesn't offend me at all. In fact,

111
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:34,610
I want to know more about it.
And

112
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,040
as I, as I go through my life,
I try and continue to listen.

113
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,310
I try to absorb opposing
opinions and process them.

114
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:47,390
And I want to just understand them.
I want to understand the context of him.

115
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,680
I want to understand the
perspective of them. It's,

116
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,940
it's how I think I'm going to eliminate
as many blind spots as possible.

117
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,070
So when someone would
tell me like a new tactic,

118
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,010
right when new tactic, when I was in
the, in the teams and someone say, Hey,

119
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:08,330
we're doing this now and there's of
course when somebody tells you something

120
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:13,040
new, there's always a part of you
that says that bristles up to it.

121
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,130
And I again,
those humbling situations,

122
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:20,660
that feeling in my gut that I didn't
want to feel it, it pushed that,

123
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:25,520
that ego down because I actually
want to hear what your ideas,

124
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:28,190
I want to hear if this is a blind
spot I haven't noticed I want,

125
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,280
I want that idea to work.
I want to see how it works.

126
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:35,270
I want to see if it works and sometimes
they would work and it's any and I would

127
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:37,460
learn something. Sometimes
they wouldn't. You know,

128
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:42,440
sometimes it would reconfirm the reason
and then that person would learn, hey,

129
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:46,940
the reason we don't do what you're
wanting to do is because of this.

130
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,760
And so now I'm helping them with
a blind spot that they might have.

131
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,500
But either way,
my goal was always to learn

132
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,110
to hear other people's viewpoints
and that's the way I remain today.

133
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,160
Eh, those other viewpoints are
going to make me sharper, right?

134
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm going to read things so that
I can see them from other angles,

135
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,570
understand things from other
ankles they can strike.

136
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,340
When you understand
something from another angle,

137
00:09:16,341 --> 00:09:20,480
you can strengthen your position
or you can leave your position.

138
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:25,030
If you realize that our position is wrong
and I,

139
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,880
and it's going to make me better,
and it's made me better not from me,

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,100
not because I want to be better,
but for the people that are around me,

141
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,690
the people up and down
the chain of command,

142
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,470
that I'm trying to support them so
I can do my job better as a leader,

143
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,990
as a follower and as a person and also

144
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,850
so that I can as much as humanly possible,

145
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,050
avoid that wretched,
seizing,

146
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,440
miserable feeling in my guts.

147
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,730
So I was thinking a lot about that.

148
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,760
And tonight we're going to explore
some principles of war actually called

149
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,630
general rules by this
individual Machiavelli.

150
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,570
This is the good Machiavelli,
Niccolo Machiavelli.

151
00:10:19,571 --> 00:10:21,760
This is the guy that wrote the prince.
He's

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,230
got all kinds of great quotes out there.

153
00:10:26,231 --> 00:10:29,950
It's better to be feared than loved
if you can. If you cannot be both.

154
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,050
He's got never, never was anything
great achieved without danger.

155
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,160
Here's one. If an injury has been done,
if an entry has to be done to a man,

156
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:46,720
it should be so severe.
That is vengeance need not be feared.

157
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,910
That's pretty ruthless.
Here's another one,

158
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,950
a hence it comes about that all armed
profits have been victorious and all on

159
00:10:58,261 --> 00:11:01,150
armed profits have been destroyed.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,820
Okay.

161
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,910
In one more quick quote as you,
you can,

162
00:11:06,911 --> 00:11:11,260
you can just Google Machiavelli and quotes
and you'll find a bunch of great ones.

163
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,810
Men rise from one ambition to another.

164
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,950
First they seek to secure
themselves against attack.

165
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,850
Then they attack others and
that's actually from the prince,

166
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:23,710
which is his most famous book.

167
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,790
And if you think about the
process of being a human being,

168
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,860
that right there is very accurate and
you can really see that with accuracy.

169
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,530
If you overlay that on Jujitsu,

170
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,710
first you seek to is secure yourself
from attack and then you attack others

171
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:41,650
right when you're rolling at first,
when you first start,

172
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:44,180
you're just trying to defend, just
trying not to get choked. Yeah.

173
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,870
And then eventually you can stop from
getting choked and you can stop from

174
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,640
getting arm locked in and you start trying
to attack those people in arm locked

175
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:53,650
down.
So that's Machiavelli and a,

176
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:57,910
if you don't know anything about them,
he was an Italian, really a politician.

177
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,720
And a diplomat. And, but on top of that,

178
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,360
this was during the renaissance period
and he's an actual renaissance man.

179
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,950
So he was a poet. He was a poet,
philosopher. He was a playwright.

180
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:16,951
He was an author of books born in 1469
died in 1527 from 1503 to 1506 he was in

181
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:25,240
charge of the Florentine militia.
And when he was in charge of that militia,

182
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:30,241
he didn't like mercenaries because he
realized that weakness of mercenaries is

183
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,610
that they, they're, they're getting
paid. That's why they're fighting.

184
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:37,480
They're not fighting be from
their true belief system.

185
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,750
So he raised and recruited a citizen
army and they were well respected on the

186
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:48,541
battlefield and they fought in some
pretty good battles and one but it didn't

187
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:53,230
last forever. Florentine was
eventually defeated and dissolved,

188
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,110
and Machiavelli was accused
of conspiracy and tortured.

189
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:02,350
And I, of course, whenever I, I
go down a lot of rabbit holes,

190
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,290
but I went down that torture rabbit
hole for a little while yesterday.

191
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,070
And they were pretty brutal about it,
but he,

192
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,170
they thought he was a
conspirator or whatever. And
he did. He even after torture,

193
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,990
they couldn't get it out of him.
They eventually just exile them.

194
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,880
And that's when he wrote
his book the Prince,

195
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,690
which I'm sure we'll cover on here at
some point. This is where you are here.

196
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:26,620
This is where the word
machiavellian that's kind of,

197
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,040
it usually refers to his book,
the Prince and,

198
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:35,041
and usually that word nowadays is used
to describe someone that's kind of

199
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:40,000
scheming and unscrupulous if like if you
look it up in the dictionary, that's,

200
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,830
it'll give you a definition
along those lines.

201
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:46,060
And like someone that's trying to
snake and make things happen happen.

202
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:52,650
But, and like I said, I'm sure we'll
cover that book at some point. But um,

203
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,300
after that he wrote another book,
which is called the art of war.

204
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,910
And it's, it's definitely a
really good book. It's Anna.

205
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,900
We will probably parse through
the entire thing at some point.

206
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,070
But one thing that's good about
it is in the end of the book,

207
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,330
he part seven of the book and
there's, we have this, the last,

208
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
the last part of the book,

209
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,060
he basically breaks out the most
important principles from the book,

210
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,680
which makes it pretty easy and
straight forward to uh, talking to, uh,

211
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:31,520
to explain them and, and then
you can get the details. And I'm,

212
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,020
like I said, I'm sure we'll get
granular at some point on it, but

213
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,900
here's what he says in this book,
he's,

214
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,110
and it's bare with me a
little bit only because the,

215
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
the translation is old.

216
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,960
I know that I've told you many things,

217
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,380
which by yourself you
might have understood and
considered, not withstanding,

218
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,300
I have done it as today.

219
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:00,540
Also I've told you for to be able
to show you better meaning thereof,

220
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,650
the quality of this army
and also to satisfy those if
there be any whom have not

221
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,250
had the same commodity,

222
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:12,251
do understand them as you nor me thinks
that there are other to tell you.

223
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,380
Then certain general rules,

224
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,590
the which you should
all have most familiar,

225
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,700
which bvs which is his way of saying
lesson. I wrote a lot of stuff.

226
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm glad you understood it
or at least you say you did,

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,910
but just in case some other
people can't understand it.

228
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,070
I'm going to break it down for you very
simply in these general rules and like I

229
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:35,090
said,
the translation,

230
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,630
the translation that I read of this book
is called the tutor translations by ag

231
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,880
and it's translated by a guy named Peter
Whitehorn in 1560 so we're talking like

232
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,430
somewhat archaic language and it's a
little bit tricky to get through bone.

233
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,670
I'll talk through them and we'll
get it into an understandable format

234
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,300
and there we go. So like I said,

235
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,910
he says, hey look, I wrote a lot of stuff.

236
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,570
Here's the general rules that you should
be most familiar with. Here we go.

237
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,210
Number one, the same.
That help if the enemy,

238
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:19,190
her teeth, the and the same that
help if the hadith the enemy.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,980
That one's pretty straightforward,
right?

240
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,330
What benefits the enemy harms you
and what benefits you harms the enemy

241
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,370
straight forward. I think, you
know, that's one of those common,

242
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,133
uh,

243
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,540
principles that across
the ages everyone says it.

244
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,280
And the reason they say that
is because people forget it.

245
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,350
People forget that if, if, if we're,

246
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,300
if we can hurt the enemy in any way,

247
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,780
it's helping us and anything we do that
benefits also is going to hurt the enemy.

248
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,470
Yeah.

249
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,470
So sometimes we forget that that's
why many of these various canons of

250
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,280
principles on war remind us of that
because it's an important fact.

251
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:05,003
Number two,

252
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,270
he that shall be in war most vigilant
to observe the devices of the enemy and

253
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:18,141
shall take most pain to exercise his
army Shalon [inaudible] least perils and

254
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:24,010
may hope most of victory.
So what does that mean?

255
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,480
That means pay attention.

256
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:30,540
That means be vigilant in observing
the methods and plans of the enemy.

257
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,890
And when you're in war,
number one,

258
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,820
pay attention to who
you're fighting against.

259
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,640
Understand who they are.
Andy Burke,

260
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,370
he was going to do and Ebi,

261
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,860
I think it was an match. You know where
he was going against yeah. Craig Jones.

262
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,810
Yeah. You only thing about Craig
Jones. Greg Jones is savage.

263
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,330
Andy, you know, he's, he's
awesome. But we're in a, we're up,

264
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,710
we're training,
we're training hard.

265
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,410
He goes and competes against
him and loses fast. Yeah.

266
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,590
Why do you lose?
He lost because Gwelf number one,

267
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:17,550
cause Craig Jones is awesome and
you know what Andy's real good at.

268
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,480
He was good at all of Jujitsu,
but he's got real good foot locks.

269
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:24,210
Got Real good heel hooks. He
likes to play that game. You know,

270
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,670
it's training with me,
trading with Dean list

271
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,250
and so he's rolling in. Didn't know
much about Craig Jones. In fact,

272
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,740
he didn't know anything about Craig Jones.
Oh Dang. They just, Oh yeah, he's good.

273
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:37,560
Whatever. Yeah. Not, not,
not in a disrespectful way.

274
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,150
But you ever heard somebody say, um,
like when they say, Hey, w w what?

275
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,710
What do you think about your opponents
left hook or whatever. When they say,

276
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,290
what do you think about your ponens
ground and pound? And they say,

277
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm not worried about my opponent,

278
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,430
it's what I'm going to do is not what
they're going to do. You know what I mean?

279
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,120
And I don't mean that in a bad way.
I'm not trying to say Andy was cocky,

280
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,030
but Andy, his thing was like, look
God, you know I do Jujitsu. Yeah.

281
00:19:00,031 --> 00:19:00,864
That was his approach.

282
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,140
Like I do Jujitsu and Hay and also
there's a little bit of like, Hey,

283
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,970
well you might go against this guy,
but he might get her,

284
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,130
you might have this or whatever. You
know what I mean? So, right, right.

285
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,360
And it was a tournament as well. So you
can't really get focused on one guy.

286
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,450
You're going to be fighting three or four
guys and one night you just got to get

287
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:16,760
your Jujitsu game up.
Yeah.

288
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:21,300
So Andy Rolls in and he goes,

289
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:25,210
he went right into Craig Jones,
his game in seconds. And,

290
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,090
and the other thing was Andy
super relaxed. Like, I mean he's,

291
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,420
he's relaxed anyways, so he's like,
oh, okay, this is, do you know,

292
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:37,360
we're just going to do some Jujitsu and
it'll escalate over time and eventually,

293
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:38,460
you know, it's something we'll, you know,

294
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:43,461
we'll get to that point and whatever and
he goes in and boom and it goes right

295
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:48,390
in to one a crack. Jane Craig
Jones is like really good moves.

296
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,430
Just goes right into it for him.

297
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:56,390
And she know I was bombed then obviously
Andy's bumped but didn't do any,

298
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,490
you know, we me, I should have been like,
hey man, let's look at your opponents.

299
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:05,460
Let's check out their game. Because
if you just know, you know how it is.

300
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,210
If you're aware of someone's game,
you can definitely mitigate it.

301
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,030
You can't defeat it. I'm not
saying he could defeat Craig Jones,

302
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,230
but he would've been, he wouldn't have
fallen into that in a matter of seconds.

303
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,570
He would have been, oh, this
is his move there. I need,

304
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,870
I know what to do to at least mitigate the
first attack, the second attack. Right.

305
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,560
If you don't do that, you're going to,
you're going to have problems. And, and,

306
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:30,180
and he got and then he came back and
read that. He's like, he's like, yeah,

307
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,500
that guy's good. So props
to my board, Craig Jones,

308
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,210
you beat my, my boy. Uh,

309
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,980
hopefully you guys will meet
again one day and you're going to,

310
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:43,320
he'll get another go and he'll
know your game a little bit better.

311
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,220
But bottom line is study your opponents,

312
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,980
study your opponents. Now can you go
too far with that? Yeah, you can. Yeah,

313
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,210
because some people think, oh, I wish
that happens sometimes when the UFC,

314
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:57,970
someone will Ms. Wade or they'll get
hurt and they'll throw a new opponent.

315
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,880
Madam though wasn't ready for that guy
had been training for a strike or now

316
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:05,530
you're putting me up against grappler or
whatever. Yeah. So you know, uh, Sarge,

317
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,820
this is pretty cool.
Sarge who was a really good,

318
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:11,290
who was and is a really good
wrestler and he's also Jujitsu now,

319
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:15,970
but he was, he said when he would
train for wrestling, you know,

320
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:18,520
cause he was a high school restaurant.
Poway,

321
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,860
which if you know anything
about wrestling and California,

322
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:22,120
we're actually in America,
you know,

323
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:25,480
Poway high school has it like
real dominant wrestling program.

324
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,960
And he was a wrestler there
as well as his brother.

325
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:33,160
But he said when he would train,
he would,

326
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,530
he would picture someone with no face.

327
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,220
And it's because,
you know,

328
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,680
when you were in the high school
wrestling scene out here in California,

329
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:44,560
you know the people that you're gonna
come up against, right? Tournament,

330
00:21:44,561 --> 00:21:47,410
you're going to come up against these six
guys and you know that two of them are

331
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:51,850
good or whatever, but he just say nope.
And when he would look at him, he's like,

332
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:56,260
when I would look at them before a match,
I wouldn't even, I just see like a blur,

333
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,940
just fog in their face.

334
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,660
And then he said once he would knew
he was going to go against that guy,

335
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,940
then he'd look at him in a,
calculate their face and be like,

336
00:22:03,941 --> 00:22:08,830
I'm gonna kill this guy. But
that's the why. What would it be?

337
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,640
His point in that was he
didn't want to get, uh,

338
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:18,490
like his mind offset by, oh,
it's not who I expected it to be.

339
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,850
Right, right. So he wouldn't have any
expectation on who was going to be,

340
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,430
he was just going to get in
the murder mode. And then when,

341
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,240
when he finally realized that
they're walking out of a map of then,

342
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,830
then he'd look at their face and go,
okay,

343
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:33,980
this is the guy I'm going against and
I'm gonna kill him. Which for Sarge,

344
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,220
you know,
that means the actual,

345
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,830
so observe the methods
and plans of your enemy.

346
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,330
Absolutely.
Next part of is you,

347
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,930
you have to endure much
hardship and training. Of
course, you got to train hard.

348
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,620
So observe your enemy, know what
they're doing, and then train really,

349
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:58,360
really hard and you're going to have a
greater chance for victory. Of course,

350
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,690
common sense. Next one. Number three,

351
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:08,190
never conduct vie men to fight the field
if first thou has not confirmed their

352
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,431
minds and know it's them to be without
fear and to be in good order for though

353
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,880
for Thou oddest never to enterprise
any dangerous thing with by soldiers.

354
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,320
But when Thou seest that
they hope to overcome.

355
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,400
So again,

356
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:35,100
we're dealing with some middle
English or I think you English, um,

357
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,290
linguists,
people can get at me if I'm wrong,

358
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,030
but we're pretty close to middle English.

359
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,630
Maybe it's a little late middle English,
but we're in the ballpark.

360
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:44,530
So what is he talking about there?

361
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,450
Never lead your soldiers into an
engagement unless you are assured of their

362
00:23:50,451 --> 00:23:53,930
courage. Mm hmm. And
then he actually says,

363
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:57,290
unless you know them to be without fear,
which is a stretch in my mind,

364
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,560
cause you're going to have people that
are gonna be afraid. In fact, we, you can,

365
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,910
you, you're gone. People are going to be
afraid when they're going into combat.

366
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,410
90 something percent.

367
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,410
A high percentage of people are
going to have some level of fear,

368
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,610
but you do need to make sure that they're
going to be able to overcome that fear.

369
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,180
So if you got people that are shaking
in their shoes and they feel, you know,

370
00:24:17,181 --> 00:24:19,700
you think they're going to, they're
not, they've not been tested at all,

371
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,550
well then that could be a real problem.

372
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:23,910
Okay.

373
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,340
Then, and then the question becomes, okay,

374
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:27,230
well how do you test if
someone's gonna be afraid or not?

375
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,030
What do you think they do in the military?

376
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,600
Yeah,

377
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,490
with people. What do they do? Want to make
them not scared? Yeah. Test their fear.

378
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,180
How do you test her fear? Put them
in scary situations, which is scary.

379
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:42,990
Situations in training.
Make them repel off the high tower,

380
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,090
make them send to airborne school.
Hey, airborne school, I would say,

381
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:49,230
you know,
of course there's,

382
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,640
there's some level of some things that
you need to learn in airborne school,

383
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,680
but you're basically,
I mean,

384
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:59,070
you can literally throw a sack of potatoes
out of an airplane with a parachute

385
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,710
on it and it's going to land up
pretty much. Okay. Most of the time,

386
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,200
and that's what you do
when you go to the school.

387
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,420
You learn the proper exit procedures.
When I went to airborne school,

388
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:12,180
it's a Kz. Here's the extra
procedures. Here is how you
land. You're floating down.

389
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:17,070
You don't have much control over your
parachute. So there's not a lot to learn.

390
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,630
Technically. It's not like a major
skillset. I mean it's a three,

391
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,540
let me put it this way, it's a three week
school, right? It's not like it's on a,

392
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,550
it's not a long intensive school about
learning how to pack parachutes or even

393
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,340
how to maneuver yourself through the air
because there's only so much you can do.

394
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,060
Yeah. So what is it that's
important about airborne school?

395
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,360
What's important about airborne school
as you're going to overcome the fear of

396
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,660
jumping out of a damn airplane,
that's important.

397
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:47,340
That's why an airborne or you'll go go
talk to the 82nd airborne division or the

398
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:48,440
hundred first airborne division.

399
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,560
Those guys are awesome and they have
that little thing that they've all done

400
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,420
that has put them,
they've been screened out a little bit,

401
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,000
cause some people are going to be
afraid. So yes, that's what you do.

402
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,330
You make people do hard,
scary things. I mean,

403
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:05,220
in the seal teams it's the same thing.
What do they do?

404
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:07,080
You're going to learn how to parachute.
Then you're gonna parachute at night.

405
00:26:07,081 --> 00:26:08,640
They're going to parachute
at night into the water.

406
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:13,050
Then you're going to jump out of a
helicopter at night at, you know,

407
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,870
20 feet into the darkness and with a boat
and you're gonna rig that thing up and

408
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,580
you're gonna dive at night and you're
going to swim at night in the open ocean

409
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,140
or you're,
or you're just going to go ghost.

410
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,110
That scares some people off for some
reason. It never really scared me. Yeah.

411
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,270
I have no fear of sharks up.
Let me rephrase that.

412
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,500
I have no fear that a shark
is randomly going to bite me.

413
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,080
If I was in the water and there
were sharks, I'd be scared. Yes.

414
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,440
And I know that there are sharks in the
water so that your guys should be scared.

415
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,310
But I dunno. I feel lucky. Yeah.

416
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,090
I feel like sharks really want
to eat me and that very much.

417
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,890
They'd rather eat like someone like you.

418
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,460
Well I guess if you're on a surf board,

419
00:26:50,461 --> 00:26:53,420
I guess that increases the chances
from what I understand. Yeah.

420
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,750
Cause you look like a seal, like a sea
animal seal. So that's what you do.

421
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,470
You put people in situations where
they're going to be afraid. You know?

422
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,600
And this is something that I think
everyone should do.

423
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:07,950
If you have a job that's
going to cost stress,

424
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:12,840
you want to put people in
stressful situations. So
that's how you test that fear.

425
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,290
And again, you're not going to go
to remove the fear from people.

426
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:19,560
What you want to figure out
is can they overcome the fear?

427
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,430
That's what you want to figure
out. Um, what else he say no,

428
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:27,920
that they're organized.
Never make an attempt unless you,

429
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:30,810
unless you see they hope for victory.

430
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:34,560
So you got to convince, if you're
telling your guys like, Hey,

431
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:38,640
we're probably gonna lose
you. Won't say that. You say,
look, it's going to be hard,

432
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,100
but there's a chance we can take this.
And you know what I mean?

433
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,520
You got to get them in that attitude,
not the attitude of like, oh,

434
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:46,620
we're just going to lose what's
going on here for no reason.

435
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,610
Don't let that happen.
Number four,

436
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,310
it is better to conquer the enemy with
famine than with iron in the victory of

437
00:27:58,891 --> 00:28:02,610
which fortune may do
more than Valliant ness.

438
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,210
That one's pretty self explanatory.

439
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:10,340
It's better to defeat the enemy
by hunger then steel, you know,

440
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,310
it's better to let them starve. Then have
to go and fight him and then he says,

441
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,430
in such a victory,
the fortune,

442
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:20,630
like your luck counts
more than Valeant ness,

443
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,430
which is cool.
Understandable.

444
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,710
This is one of those things where
you've heard me say before he,

445
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,740
the best victories are the victories
where the person doesn't even know that

446
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:35,070
you're fighting them. That's the
best victory. And then if you can,

447
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:38,340
if you can maintain your ego
after you win and you don't gloat,

448
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,890
then they never even did it. Even register
it, right? They didn't know they were.

449
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,810
They didn't know they were
in a fight. That's what you
want. This is very similar,

450
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,880
but this, this part, I'll throw a
little back at it in such fortune,

451
00:28:50,881 --> 00:28:55,110
victory counts more than Valeant nus.
Yeah.

452
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:57,810
Good fortune is going to help. But guess
what? We're going to make our own luck,

453
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,650
right? We're going to make our own
luck. That's what we're gonna do.

454
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,500
We're gonna and we're gonna
make bad luck for the enemy.

455
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,430
We're going to dry up rivers. We're going
to damn river so they can't grow food.

456
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,290
That's what we're going to do.

457
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,460
So when it cut off supply chains,

458
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,620
that's what we're gonna do. We're gonna
make, we're gonna make fortune favor us.

459
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,190
Number five,
no purpose is better than that,

460
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,460
which is hidden from the enemy
until you've executed it. Boom.

461
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,233
Pretty straightforward.

462
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,020
No plan is better than that which you
have concealed from the enemy until the

463
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:39,900
time you execute it.
No doubt.

464
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,750
True in life. True in
business, true in Jujitsu.

465
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,920
That's what the judge essentially the
element of surprise, surprise. If you,

466
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,873
if you,

467
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,150
if your enemy doesn't know what you're
gonna do and then you're done and they go,

468
00:29:55,151 --> 00:29:57,070
oh,
that was a nice arm walk or wow,

469
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:59,350
you really took over that market
share and I didn't see it coming.

470
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,730
If you don't see it coming, that's really
it. We see it coming from a mile away.

471
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,510
It's like, ah, yeah. You can still do
that sometimes dean does that. Yeah,

472
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:11,830
but we do. Yeah, we talked about that.
What he does different things though.

473
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:15,310
Like yeah, he, he'll like
many, many steps. Yeah.

474
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,470
He'll tie up your defenses while it's
when you, when you see the incoming,

475
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,740
he ties up all your defenses
like as it gets close.

476
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:29,590
Number six to know in the war,

477
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,620
how to understand occasion and to take
it help if more than any other thing to

478
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:38,104
know one war,

479
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,550
how to understand occasion and take
it help if more than any other thing.

480
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,270
What does that mean?
That means you,

481
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,590
one of the best skills you can have
is knowing how to recognize a good

482
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,620
opportunity in war or in life and take
advantage of that opportunity that is

483
00:30:56,951 --> 00:30:58,930
more beneficial than anything else.
And you know,

484
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,980
the biggest and most Blakeman
example where you see this,

485
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:07,120
well your kids aren't old
enough, but with kids, just kids,

486
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,320
kids have so much opportunity in life.
Yeah.

487
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,910
And they just don't take advantage
of it. Like they should. Right. Yeah.

488
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,430
Yeah.
I could see how that can be for sure.

489
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:23,740
But I think that's because they have life
is connecting now and then the future.

490
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:28,030
You know, I guess that's the thing.
Yeah. There's no doubt that they have,

491
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:32,320
there's no doubt that they have that
athletes. Yeah. Real good athletes.

492
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:35,230
Same thing. They have
all this potential. Yeah.

493
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,750
Any time someone, well not anytime.
Oftentimes somebody that are,

494
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:44,080
some people that are given a gift,
it's just given to them.

495
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,560
They don't have to work for it.
They don't want to take advantage of it.

496
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,940
They don't see the opportunity.

497
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,190
They don't take advantage
of the opportunity or that
skill set is, yeah. Cause.

498
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,700
Yeah, almost like, um, you know,

499
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:59,320
when you give a kid a gift verse
or money versus if they earn it,

500
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,710
I think you covered that in a way
of the world kid. Yeah. That's,

501
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:06,850
that's way covered on way of the warrior
kid. When you earn it, it's like,

502
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:07,241
you know,

503
00:32:07,241 --> 00:32:10,780
the hard work it takes and you kind of
appreciate it and then whatever comes out

504
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:12,720
of that. But yeah, if it's
given to you, you just,

505
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:16,150
you run the risk of
squandering it for sure.

506
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,640
Especially when the going
gets rough, you know? No, no.

507
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,520
Next
nature breed.

508
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:28,570
If few strong men,

509
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,910
the industry and the
exercise make with many,

510
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,070
what does that mean? That means,
you know, nature makes very

511
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,980
few strong brave men,

512
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,860
but hard work and training
makes many boom. Yeah.

513
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,880
That'll work for it. Yeah. You want people
to be brave. You want people to be, uh,

514
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:58,790
have courage. Make them
strong, make them work hard.

515
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,600
Yeah. That will absolutely
increase their bravery.

516
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,770
And remember that question we got asco
a while ago about how do I make my unit

517
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,910
guys in the military, military
you, how do I make them proud?

518
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,940
How do they increase their level of pride?
Train hard.

519
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,680
They will get physically stronger.

520
00:33:15,681 --> 00:33:20,681
They will get mentally stronger and from
that they will start to take pride in

521
00:33:21,051 --> 00:33:25,340
themselves and pride in
themselves as a unit. Eight

522
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,870
discipline may do more in war than fury

523
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:38,220
figured you'd like. Yeah,
I kind of liked that one.

524
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:40,620
Discipline counts more than fury in war.

525
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,980
Discipline counts more than fury in life.

526
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,120
I'm not discounting emotions.

527
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm not doing that because
you can't cause sometimes man,

528
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,450
people's emotions they get,

529
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:57,360
they will carry them through
a really tough time period.

530
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,300
That's why in discipline equals freedom.
In the field manual,

531
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:04,200
I talk about how you got to use both
logic and you got to use emotions and when

532
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,080
sometimes when emotionally it doesn't
make any sense or you're going to break

533
00:34:07,081 --> 00:34:09,630
emotionally, you got to go with the
logic of the situation that I got.

534
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,940
I got to drive through
this and vice versa.

535
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:14,370
Sometimes the lodge cause like
this makes no sense whatsoever.

536
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:18,780
Turned to the emotional
side. Yup. But discipline,

537
00:34:18,781 --> 00:34:21,120
he says may do more and he's right.

538
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,820
It's not 100% is like discipline
because if you have people that are just

539
00:34:23,821 --> 00:34:27,090
discipline, but they have no
heart, they have no emotion.
What I, how good are they?

540
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:30,480
They're not that good. Yeah, they're not,

541
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,790
they're not as good as
the person that has both.

542
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,240
There's not as good as a person that
has discipline and a little bit of fury.

543
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:40,650
They can kind of get crazy when they
need to button in MMA. You see this,

544
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,030
you'll see someone when they're young and
they'll lose some fights cause they'll,

545
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:48,810
they'll sit someone down or whatever
and then they'll just go crazy trying to

546
00:34:48,811 --> 00:34:50,780
catch them to get Connor triangle.
Yeah.

547
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:56,620
You have to maintain your
discipline even during the,

548
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,640
the actual battle.
You have to maintain your discipline.

549
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,100
You can't let the fury get ahold of you.

550
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,020
Yeah. Too much discipline,
fury, discipline. Fear. Yeah.

551
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,260
Once you watch the Cyborg fight, right.
The reason why I had Amanda Nunez. Yes.

552
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,050
So this is what it seemed like.
He's fast,

553
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,180
but this is what it's looked like where
cyborg landed like a solid one and

554
00:35:18,181 --> 00:35:22,470
Amanda Nunez as a response unleashed fury,

555
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,750
like some legit fury fury,

556
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,820
but it was disciplined fury because
when she started landing hard ones she

557
00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:33,000
didn't like overcome it. It was
like really balance. You know,

558
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,640
she looked great but there was some,
there was a lot of fury.

559
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:38,160
So fury like it wasn't like

560
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,110
all just spoken calculated like punches
who was there was fury and Tim Kennedy,

561
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:44,130
someone's like Ah,

562
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,400
do UFC tweeted out like she's throwing
haymakers and Tim Kennedy's like those

563
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,840
aren't haymakers cause every
single one of them hit,

564
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,200
they were full punches from Amanda that
we're nailing Cyborg right in the head.

565
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,800
Yeah. Most of the time, like in
five times in a row you don't,

566
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,200
you don't normally see five punches land,

567
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,690
especially not punches that
are thrown with that much fury.

568
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,280
He can kind of tell when
like you see like their,

569
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:20,870
their feet when they're
throwing punches like you get,

570
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,780
there's like a huge forward lean.
If they,

571
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,250
if they're haymakers there's like this
huge Ford liens and they usually pressing

572
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:30,870
forward like fully. But when they're like
disciplined, there's like that you see,

573
00:36:30,871 --> 00:36:33,610
you can see the balance. Like they'll
back up just a little bit. You know,

574
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,140
it's good. So good. Yeah. That was crazy.

575
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:41,460
Discipline may do more then fury.

576
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,590
So you know what, make sure you have
some discipline it. All right. Next one.

577
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:47,424
Number nine,

578
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,320
when any depart from the enemy's
side for to come to serve the,

579
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,940
when they be faithful,
they shall be unto thee.

580
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,240
Always great gains for that power of
the adversaries are more diminished with

581
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:07,290
the loss of them that run away then
bone of then those that be slain.

582
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:13,250
Although that the name of a fugitive
be to new friend suspected and old two

583
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:18,960
odious, too old odious. So when
he's talking about traders,

584
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:20,040
there three is talking about,

585
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,890
so when you say when any depart from
the enemy side to come serve you.

586
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,510
So when when people leave the enemy
and they come to serve with you,

587
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,400
they're going to be more loyal

588
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:34,890
and they're great.
They're great acquisition.

589
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:40,910
And actually he's saying that people that
leave the enemy and come to your side

590
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,430
are more powerful for you. Then
people that, that you've killed

591
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:51,180
and there they have more value.
The,

592
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,870
when they come aboard your team,
they're going to be suspected.

593
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,280
You know that the old,

594
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,200
that your team is going to look at him
with like a cautious eye and the team

595
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:04,590
that they left are going to hate them.
Yeah. They're going to hate them.

596
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,370
That was weird when Solzhenitsyn was
saying that when they would capture the

597
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,610
Russian turncoat soldiers that
were now fighting for the Nazis,

598
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:19,200
as soon as they spoke any Russian,
they'd kill him. That was,

599
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:23,370
that was a pretty scary thought. So this
is very accurate from that perspective.

600
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,190
Yeah. Like if you're a trader, we're
not even going to give you a chance.

601
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,420
We're just going to kill you.
Yeah. Wait, so who, wait, who?

602
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,560
So the Russians, the
Russians didn't kill him. No.

603
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,200
So there was a whole group
of Russian soldiers, yeah.

604
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:44,230
That turned against Stalin and turned
against Russia and started fighting for

605
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,320
the Nazis.
Yeah.

606
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:49,360
And so when the Russians
would capture those,

607
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:51,760
what they consider to be traders,

608
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:57,100
as soon as they heard a soldier speaking
Russian, they'd kill him. The Nazis,

609
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:01,630
you mean they were, they were Russian
soldiers fighting for the Nazis.

610
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:06,370
Was it fossil? That was the guy's
name. So there was a German or, sorry,

611
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:10,600
a Russian general that was the
leader of that whole group.

612
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,670
The Vos alarmy I think was the name.
Yeah.

613
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,120
And so when the Russian Stalin's Russian
actual red soldiers would capture these

614
00:39:21,461 --> 00:39:25,150
traders that were fighting against them,
now they would,

615
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:29,740
if they heard them speaking Russian,
they'd kill him. Hmm. So this is

616
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,810
from that perspective.
It's accurate. Yeah.

617
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,200
I wonder why they're more valuable,
you think? Because what cause or what,

618
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,910
or loyal, he said loyal,
right to, well, the,

619
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,680
the jerk, the Russian soldiers that
were now fighting for the Nazis,

620
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,240
they would fight to the death because
they knew that they were dead anyway.

621
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:50,440
Right. That captured, yeah. Like if
they got, yeah. So yeah, they were,

622
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,230
they would fight even harder.
Uh,

623
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,000
the thing that I'm not sure about this
is, well, I guess I agree with it.

624
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,920
I do agree with it. When someone's a
trader, you're suspect of them, right?

625
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,230
You know, you're just,
you're just like, Hey,

626
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,990
are you get to your attorney or
you're a trader, I'm suspect to you.

627
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:12,610
So it's going to take a little time for
me to actually trust that you really

628
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:16,090
came to Mizade.
But I guess like when you think about,

629
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:17,200
just like how you said that,
you know,

630
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,930
they know they're dead anyway kind
of thing where it's like, okay,

631
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,910
let's say mean you were enemies,
whatever.

632
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:26,410
And one of my guys goes to you and
says, Hey, I give up, I'll help you.

633
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:28,360
I give up. You're like, okay, he gives up,

634
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:32,910
I get it and let's see what he has to
offer kind of thing. But I suspect. Yeah,

635
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,450
but your suspect,
but let's say

636
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,480
a guy in your team used to be on my team
and I know that I'm pissed at that guy.

637
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,100
And then he gives up now to me,
to my guys like Mike,

638
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:48,580
I see him or whatever and he's like, Hey,
I give up. I'll help you. Oh No, no, no.

639
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:51,970
You don't give up your debt. Yeah. So
it's like that. Like how you see it,

640
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:56,800
they know they're dead anyway. What the
Russians did to the vasile soldiers. Yeah.

641
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,760
So you, oh you traded. Okay, cool.
You're dead. And that makes sense. Right?

642
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,390
So that's probably why they have to be
loyal because it's either loyalty or

643
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,960
death, you know, they can't give
up anymore. If I am not a trader,

644
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:11,710
I can give up and get beat, pow
be whatever I can, I can give up.

645
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,830
I have that option trader
who already made the trade,

646
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,810
he doesn't have that option.
That's why he's loyal.

647
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,600
He has to be looking at a minimum.
He's going to fight to the death.

648
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,060
And it's interesting too that

649
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,060
traders are, you know, in the business
world, because in the business world,

650
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,570
you know, there's, everyone's always,

651
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:34,571
recruiting is limited number of the
human limits in the world and we can only

652
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:39,320
get so many people that can do this job.

653
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,400
And if you have skills in that job,
you're getting recruited all the time.

654
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,140
And so that's,
that hurts when they leave.

655
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,580
And that's why. And, and just to
kind of close the loop on this,

656
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,970
when they leave almost all the time,
the reason,

657
00:41:56,030 --> 00:42:00,200
the reason that they're leaving is because
of leadership or I should say lack of

658
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:02,810
leadership inside their organization.
So if you have a,

659
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:07,520
if you have a problem hanging on
to people in your organization,

660
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:12,680
it's most likely a leadership problem.
Not a comp problem,

661
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:18,440
not a midlife crisis problem for the
employee. It's a leadership problem.

662
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,970
Hmm.
Cause good,

663
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,970
good people will stay with good leaders
and if there's not good leaders,

664
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,610
they're looking for another job,
they're looking for another way,

665
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:30,200
they're looking for another
opportunity. Makes Sense. Leadership,

666
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:32,330
leadership, leadership. Get some

667
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,690
number 10
better.

668
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,720
It is in pitching the field to reserve
behind the first front aid enough then to

669
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:48,650
make the front bigger to
disperse the soldiers.

670
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:52,883
Okay.

671
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,100
What that's saying is it's better to keep
your reserves just behind that to keep

672
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:04,281
some reserves just behind the front lines
rather than spread out your reserves

673
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,770
and take on a bigger front trying to
hold more area. It's editing, you know,

674
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:12,000
this is prioritize and
execute, right? Keep your,

675
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,050
keep your focus of effort even with
your reserves. Keep focus of effort,

676
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,410
keep them consolidated so
you can utilize them well.

677
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,920
Next up,
number 11

678
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,360
he is difficultly overcome,

679
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:32,640
which can know his own power
and the same of the enemy.

680
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,200
Okay, let's, that was
almost like a a Yoda type.

681
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,880
He is difficult to overcome.

682
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:46,881
So what we're saying there is it's hard
to overcome someone who knows how to

683
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:52,431
recognize or knows and understands his
own power and the power of the enemy.

684
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:56,310
So does that mean know your strengths and
weaknesses? Right. That's what it means.

685
00:43:56,910 --> 00:44:00,540
Yeah. Since he says that, right. Is
this something about winning the deal?

686
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,600
Definitely.
Number 12,

687
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:09,050
the Valliant ness of the soldiers
available more than the multitude.

688
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:15,390
Sometimes the situation help
biff more than the valueless.

689
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,111
Okay.

690
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:20,100
So what we're talking about there is
that the bravery of the soldiers is worth

691
00:44:20,101 --> 00:44:24,210
more than the number of soldiers you have.
Makes Sense.

692
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,980
If you have brave,
courageous soldiers,

693
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:31,630
they can take a more,

694
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,010
they can do a lot more than people
were soldiers that are afraid.

695
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,920
So you want brave soldiers
and then it says the site,

696
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:44,940
what does it say that
sometimes the situation help
if more than the voluminous.

697
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,013
So even that,

698
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,680
what trumps the courageous and what
trumps the bravery is what's the,

699
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,520
what's the terrain situation? You know,
what's the environment that you're in?

700
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:59,730
What are the rules of the game? One of
the rules of the game that you're playing.

701
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:01,920
Cause if you,
if you know the rules,

702
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,380
you're going to be in a a
much better situation. The uh,

703
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:10,050
this happens in Jujitsu, right? Yes.

704
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,820
Because the rules are always
a little bit different.

705
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,930
There's no unified set of rules and
Jujitsu. Yeah, there's some clothes,

706
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,950
but there is no unified set of rules
and sometimes someone will lose simply

707
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,260
because they don't know the rules.
And then once you know the rules,

708
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:26,190
you've got to train to
the rules. Like Ebi, Ebi,

709
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:29,400
you have those positions that you
start up in. If you're an overtime,

710
00:45:29,401 --> 00:45:32,940
you start in spider web, you start on the
back, right. If you don't, if you don't,

711
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,110
if once you know those roles,

712
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:37,620
then you've got to practice
those positions so you
can finish the emoc so you

713
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:40,260
can finish from the back offer. You can
escape from either one of those too.

714
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,970
If you don't know that and you're gonna
practice it. Because like for instance,

715
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:52,740
I'm pretty good at finishing on our lock.
Pretty good at finishing an arm lock.

716
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,753
Sure.

717
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,040
On the back I normally transitioned
from the back to another position.

718
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,390
So I would,
if I was going in Ebi Tournament,

719
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,840
I'd have to go and focus on what that
rule set is and make sure I know how to

720
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:09,840
win from that position. Yeah, yeah. Fully.

721
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,650
Yeah. Big One is the
submission only versus points.

722
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,680
So if people like let's say they spend
10 years competing with points in the

723
00:46:20,431 --> 00:46:21,270
tournaments,
you know,

724
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,570
then they go to submission only with the
guy who is only trained in submission

725
00:46:24,571 --> 00:46:28,380
only he's going to, you know, going
to have an added advantage. Yeah.

726
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,340
In all of these different, yeah, different
ways cause certain rules don't apply.

727
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:34,860
Some do.
Yeah.

728
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:38,900
Terrain Park, man Ed, this is, this is,

729
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,180
it took me a while to understand
this in my navy career,

730
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:48,230
how important to reign is
and now it's so obvious,

731
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,690
but when you're maneuvering
on the battlefield,

732
00:46:50,691 --> 00:46:52,130
if you know how to read terrain wealth,

733
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,660
you have a complete advantage over the
enemy. Complete advantage over the enemy.

734
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,990
You should be paying attention
to that terrain. Studying maps,

735
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:05,240
looking at it and now they have all these
you can, you can simulate the earth,

736
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,820
right?
It's a Google maps like a high speed.

737
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:12,020
We can get down at eye level and you can
walk the terrain and really understand

738
00:47:12,021 --> 00:47:15,440
what the visibility is like. That's
the kind of, that's that's you should,

739
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,650
you got to take advantage of those tools.
You got to understand the terrain,

740
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,130
you got to understand the terrain that
you're going into in the business world.

741
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,200
You'd go, got to go into a company
understanding what the situation is there.

742
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,520
When you get hired into a new,
you want to know the terrain,

743
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,910
you want to know who's got the clout.
Yep.

744
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,370
You want to know who the
movers and shakers are.

745
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:41,050
You want to know what things are
off limits and whatever. Yeah.

746
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:43,500
I don't know who's buying.
Okay.

747
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,670
Like, you know how the, you know, people
always say this is $1 billion industry,

748
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,790
right? Like that kind of stuff.
Like, Oh, you know, how's the,

749
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,560
what's the need for a year

750
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,170
product? Um, remembering, because I watch
shark tank, this is what they always ask.

751
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,080
What was the, uh, was
this a particular product?

752
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,220
No, no, no. Everyone, like pretty much,

753
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:07,030
that's one of the things like they ask
or they say, there'll be like, oh yeah,

754
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:11,470
this is like a million house, you know,
a million people own pets, you know,

755
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,890
and all of these pets need this, you know,
so, yes. And you see what I'm saying?

756
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:18,040
So they kinda, they got another
terrain in that way. Yeah, that's true.

757
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,410
They don't know how many
people have pets then.

758
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:23,550
They don't know how many people
going to buy that shampoo. You know,

759
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,070
you gotta know that one dude shark tank.

760
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:29,470
We maybe we should just do a
leadership show about shark tank.

761
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:33,610
What you've learned from
shark tank. Sure. Next up,

762
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,960
number 13 new in sudden thing.

763
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,450
Make armies afraid.

764
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,430
Slow and accustom things
be little regarded of them.

765
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:52,330
Therefore make thy army practice and
to know with small fights a new enemy

766
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:57,890
before thou come to
fight the field with him.

767
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,953
Oh,

768
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,850
middle English coming at
you. So what, what is that?

769
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,310
What it basically what we're saying
here is a number one new and surprising

770
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:13,570
things. Frightened armies. Hmm?
The new and surprising things.

771
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,433
Frightened people.

772
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,660
So on the opposing to that customary
and expected things they can handle.

773
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:29,770
So what do you do? How do you do? How do
you, how do you properly mitigate that?

774
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,610
Therefore you practice and you fight
small engagements to get them experienced

775
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,290
before you go to battle on the big
battlefield with them, with the enemy.

776
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,400
That's what you do. Train
hard, don't dive right in.

777
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,750
Get them used to the new technology.
That's what you do.

778
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,350
This is another good one with kids,
right?

779
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,610
You throw your kid into this scenario
that they haven't been into before.

780
00:49:57,611 --> 00:50:01,810
You give him a little taste of it. Mm. Oh
yeah. This is a, this is exposure therapy.

781
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:04,750
Once again,
I get asked on the warrior kid podcasts,

782
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:09,810
I get asked every like every day I get
at least one question from a kid that's

783
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:15,070
I'm afraid of. What do I do? And I,

784
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,750
I usually wait two or three podcasts
before I answer the same question again

785
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,750
because it's kids. They got to get the
reputation they've got to get the reps in.

786
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:26,500
Yeah. But it's exposure therapy.
You're afraid of something cool.

787
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,500
Do a little of it. They do a little bit
more and that's unknowingly what I did.

788
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:34,730
And where the warrior kid one with
him overcoming his fear of the water.

789
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:37,810
I didn't know that that was a real thing.
Not until Jordan peers.

790
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,990
This is called exposure therapy.
Yeah.

791
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,840
I guess I need to talk like Kermit
the frog to imitate Jordan busters,

792
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,570
but he's like, yeah, that's
exposure therapy. Yeah. Oh, okay.

793
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,530
Next. Number 13 I'm going,
I went on to number 14

794
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:00,050
she that with disorder
follow with the enemy.

795
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,880
After that he is broken.

796
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:06,680
We'll do no other than to
become of a conqueror. A loser.

797
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,840
If you pursue a routed enemy
in a disorganized manner,

798
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,010
victory will be lost and you'll
become a loser. Keep it under control.

799
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,840
All the Amanda Nunez, right?
Sure. She had the victory and the,

800
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,890
you ever seen that?

801
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,450
That one real quick clip and I
forget who the fighter is. It did.

802
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:29,284
It is the UFC.

803
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:34,890
The guy takes a body shot and he keels
over like he's about to like go down and

804
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:37,580
the dude comes running in swinging.
Yeah.

805
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:42,340
The dude that's killed over like
he's hurt just Barak. He wasn't hurt.

806
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,270
He was just faking it.

807
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:47,250
Yeah. I think he was hurt
talking about Scott. Yeah.

808
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,330
Maybe he was hurt but he wasn't hurt
as bad as he right cross functional.

809
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,090
Apparently fairly cause he
knocked the dude out. Yeah,

810
00:51:54,091 --> 00:51:58,040
it was the last thing is his
nickname is Drago. I know that

811
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:00,720
it's interesting that that
stuff doesn't happen more often.

812
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:04,050
It's like trick football plays.
Yeah.

813
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:06,240
How come more trick football
players don't happen

814
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,170
because they'd lose their
trickery element of it.

815
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,600
And sometimes there's
a lot of risk involved.

816
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:16,190
There's more risks than like a traditional
play a lot of times. Yeah. Yeah.

817
00:52:16,191 --> 00:52:20,340
And it's like the, like the rope a dope.
Remember that? The rope a dope. Oh yeah.

818
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:20,850
Yeah.

819
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,200
You essentially like act like you're kind
of hurt or tired or whatever and then

820
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:27,740
they punched himself out. They
need get them, but yeah, yeah,

821
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:29,480
yeah,

822
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,190
yeah.
You gotta be careful in that canned stuff.

823
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,090
So when you do have your enemy

824
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:37,660
on the run,

825
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,040
okay.

826
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:42,280
Don't go after him crazy. Okay.
Keep it under control. Yeah.

827
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:46,930
There is a play in football called the
reverse. Right. And I thought that,

828
00:52:46,931 --> 00:52:50,900
cause you just said, why don't they
run? No, I didn't play football. Yeah.

829
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,220
And when you see that trick
plays, yeah. Then you think,

830
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:57,040
well that seemed to work pretty good.
Why don't they do that stuff more often?

831
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,630
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So here's the
common trick play, right? The um,

832
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,300
the quarterback does this,
so sweep right through.

833
00:53:04,301 --> 00:53:08,980
They got to the running back there, runs
the outside and then the running back,

834
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:11,700
oh, he stops before he reached
the lightest scrimmage.

835
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,500
He stops and he throws the
football not to a receiver,

836
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:18,430
but to the quarterback who ran a
route on the other side of the field.

837
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:21,010
And cause no one's going to cover the
quarterback. He's not a receipt Reno.

838
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:25,260
And that was wide open to pass.
Oh, he's wide open. So called, ah,

839
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,060
we called it passed back to
the quarterback. So good.

840
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:31,760
Like 38 sweet pass back to the quote.
Okay.

841
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:34,580
But I can see where there's
risk in that one. Yes,

842
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:38,250
because that's the running back back.
So he got to nail that throw,

843
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:41,600
which is really hard for running
back typically. But I'd say the,

844
00:53:41,601 --> 00:53:45,930
the one that would always
work is in pop Warner anyway.

845
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:49,830
It would always work is the reverse.
It's essentially like you do a sweet,

846
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,010
everyone's running this way to block for
this writing back everyone except for

847
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:55,890
the one tight end or the why do you see
where water of who's coming this way and

848
00:53:55,891 --> 00:53:57,630
the running back hands it
off to him going this way.

849
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,250
So he's full speed running this way.

850
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,310
So everyone has to change
direction to chase him.

851
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,530
And usually that set of fields wide open,
um,

852
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,620
it works way better in pop Warner and
younger teams because they don't know like

853
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,330
these, these situations.
Like they don't know.

854
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,610
They just see everyone running there
and they're just sort of go, you know,

855
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:17,330
more than a professional. They're going
to be like, wait, I shouldn't just be,

856
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:20,700
you know. Um, but that was one I was like,

857
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,620
why don't we just always run the reverse?

858
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,120
Because every time this is this
team that we played against,

859
00:54:25,121 --> 00:54:26,770
they'd always run it.
And it always will.

860
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,840
I understand why. If you ran
it every time, well then,

861
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,310
then the regular reverse or what are the
regular play would become the surprise.

862
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:35,503
But it seems like,

863
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,750
it seems like you could keep
people guessing a little bit more.

864
00:54:38,751 --> 00:54:40,010
Those trick plays always see,

865
00:54:40,011 --> 00:54:41,820
I was looking at him going
how I was pretty creative and

866
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:44,010
pretty good. Yeah. Yeah.

867
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,440
I think you see it like, oh, kind of
like I said, like when you go up in,

868
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:51,990
um, like skill, like you can
go on to the pros or whatever.

869
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:56,100
Trick plays don't work is good. They
have to be really advanced trick plays.

870
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:56,750
That's when you,

871
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,020
have you ever seen like the
trick play that like where

872
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,810
day, like almost walk off the field? Yeah.

873
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,490
And then they like walk over like
there's something wrong with the ball or

874
00:55:06,491 --> 00:55:08,890
something like stand up and they'll
be like, no, something's wrong.

875
00:55:08,891 --> 00:55:12,190
And they will and then they just start
running. Yeah. Yeah. So even that,

876
00:55:12,191 --> 00:55:14,920
and then those can backfire
too because there'll be like,

877
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,620
if all it takes is one defensive
person to know that hey,

878
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,900
that ball is in play right now.

879
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,540
So they can just sort of walk
over and hit it out of the hand,

880
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:25,300
grab it from whatever they want because
no one's blocking them. You know,

881
00:55:25,301 --> 00:55:26,650
no one's like everyone.
It's Kinda,

882
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,010
it's just risky check and get more people
doing that. They're going to be like,

883
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:33,520
oh, they're hip to it and
it would never work after

884
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,370
awhile. Um, number 15,

885
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:42,120
he did prepare if not necessary victuals
to live upon is overcome without iron.

886
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:45,460
So,
um,

887
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:51,520
whoever does not prepare
food and provisions necessary
to live is going to be

888
00:55:51,521 --> 00:55:54,220
overcome without any weapons at all.
So what does that mean?

889
00:55:54,221 --> 00:55:57,640
Take care of your people, take care of,
make sure you take care of your logistics.

890
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,990
Logistics wins,
wars and people need to survive.

891
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,190
So do that. Number 16, he,

892
00:56:06,191 --> 00:56:10,900
that trusteth more in horseman than
in footmen or more in footmen than in

893
00:56:10,901 --> 00:56:13,750
horseman must accommodate
himself with the situation.

894
00:56:13,751 --> 00:56:18,520
So in the ancient times you had cavalry
on horses and you had the infantry men

895
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:22,570
on the feet and he's saying if
you prefer one over the other,

896
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:29,310
then you have to put yourself in the
right situation where it's advantageous.

897
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,353
Yeah.

898
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,510
So that's why it's good to
be well balanced and not
really prefer one over the

899
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:38,530
other.
But if you do,

900
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:43,420
then put yourself in a situation that's
most advantageous to your style or

901
00:56:43,421 --> 00:56:45,330
preference of fighting.
Hmm.

902
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,020
Okay.

903
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:52,210
Make sure you learn how to wrestle
because if you don't know how to wrestle,

904
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,270
someone else is going to dictate to you
where that fight is going to go. Yeah.

905
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,653
Okay.

906
00:56:58,930 --> 00:57:01,960
17 when vow.
Right?

907
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:07,980
See if in the day there be coming any
spy into the camp because every man to go

908
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:13,300
into his lodge.

909
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,073
Yeah.

910
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:16,431
Okay,

911
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:20,240
so what we're saying is this pretty
straight forward basic headcount or if you

912
00:57:20,241 --> 00:57:23,480
want to see if there's a spine of the camp
average, send everyone to their place.

913
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,980
You know, get a head count. No
big deal. 18 change purpose.

914
00:57:27,981 --> 00:57:30,560
Windau perceives that the
enemy half foreseen it.

915
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,060
Okay.

916
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:33,893
Does that mean if you,

917
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,990
if you think the enemy or if you perceive
that the enemy knows what you're doing,

918
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:40,530
didn't change your plan, that's, that's
what that means. Pretty straight forward.

919
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:44,070
Now where we don't do that or the reason,

920
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:46,890
most of the time we don't
do that is because our ego,

921
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,480
we got our plan and we're going to
stick to it. Now this is a total,

922
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:58,550
this is why leadership is hard because
there's a point where your plan,

923
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,810
you got your plan, and if you stick to
your plan, you can, it's going to work,

924
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:07,470
right? And then there's a point
where you could stick in your plan.

925
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,860
You're sticking with the plan and it's
going to fail because it's not working.

926
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:15,210
So as a leader, this of the hardest
thing to do as leaders to recognize,

927
00:58:15,211 --> 00:58:19,050
like you know what? The plan that I came
up with, it's not going to be perfect,

928
00:58:19,051 --> 00:58:20,700
but it's still going to work
and where to go with it.

929
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:25,290
Because to try and change the plan
halfway through is really hard to do.

930
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,170
Even if you were hearse,
the contingencies. Now,

931
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,790
if you are the contingencies properly,

932
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:32,280
you're probably gonna be ale to
execute your new plan pretty easily.

933
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,740
But if you didn't,
it's going to be a problem.

934
00:58:35,610 --> 00:58:37,680
So this is one of the hardest
things for a leader to do,

935
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:40,620
is to pay enough attention and
then weigh the risk versus reward.

936
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,190
Because if you're coming up with a,

937
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,990
if you have your plan and you're
executing the plan and all of a sudden

938
00:58:45,991 --> 00:58:46,590
something changes,

939
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,020
not quite what you thought and you decide
you're going to try and do something

940
00:58:49,021 --> 00:58:49,854
completely different,

941
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:53,580
what your changes that you make on the
fly are going to cause as much confusion

942
00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:57,690
as what the enemy's doing. And it's
going to be a real problem. However,

943
00:58:57,870 --> 00:58:58,950
like this says,

944
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:04,020
if the enemy sees what you're doing and
now the reacting to it in a proper way

945
00:59:04,021 --> 00:59:06,480
and your plan is no longer effective,
you have to be able to,

946
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:12,230
you have to be able to comprehend that
and discern whether you should change or

947
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,310
not. And that's one of the
hardest things for Lee, uh,

948
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,390
hardest decisions for a leader
to make as it's happening.

949
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:22,010
What's worse than that is we have a
long of time when you start talking

950
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,760
about strategic plans,
this is where ego gets more involved.

951
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:31,050
Because when I have this plan and this
is what we're going to do and I'm just

952
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:34,430
going to stick with it, and if it's
not working, I'm going to do it harder.

953
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:40,860
So that's what you want to watch out for.
You know, there's like some of these, um,

954
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:45,950
companies being taken down
by online companies, right?

955
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,400
You got to have change your game
plan. You know, you got to adjust.

956
00:59:49,401 --> 00:59:51,110
You've got to look at them and
say, okay, what are they doing?

957
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:55,550
Where are they going? We know blockbuster.
Like, like I've said this before,

958
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:59,270
blockbuster could have,
could have completely dominated Netflix,

959
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,120
but what did they do? Nope,
we're just over here. Hey,

960
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:04,610
people are going to keep coming
to our stores. Yeah. You know,

961
01:00:04,611 --> 01:00:07,400
there's a certain feeling that you get
when you come into a store and you get to

962
01:00:07,401 --> 01:00:08,870
look at on browse with the movies.

963
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,150
It's something exciting to get to pick
up popcorn where you can to get popcorn

964
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:14,360
at your house. You know, people are gonna
want to keep coming in to these stores,

965
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,170
right? No, actually they're not. They
already have popcorn at their house.

966
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:20,660
Amazon delivered it yesterday in an hour,

967
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:23,810
by the way up and then
your terrain to an Allen.

968
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:27,470
And yet they had all the
relationships with the movie places.

969
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,670
What are those movie companies called?
[inaudible] of the production companies.

970
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:35,000
What is it like? What's Warner brothers?
What does that production studio.

971
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,910
They had studio, they got the
relationships with the studios.

972
01:00:37,911 --> 01:00:41,030
They could've been like, hey, we're
gonna start selling this stuff online,

973
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:44,090
and they would have said, well, that
doesn't make any sense because the,

974
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,970
it's going to be all jumbled up
when it gets downloaded. Yeah,

975
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:49,570
but it's going to get better. We're
just playing the long game. Yeah.

976
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,490
It's weird that blind said
they were thinking, you know,

977
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:55,940
it's too hard to download a movie on
the Internet is going to be jumbled up.

978
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,580
There's going to be buffering.
No one even knew what Bob did.

979
01:00:58,581 --> 01:01:03,020
Netflix and event buffering.
Buffering is just the Internet situation.

980
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,150
Yeah.
When it has to catch up.

981
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:09,680
Do you remember five years ago there
was buffering on all kinds of stuff.

982
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,950
Now there's hardly any buffering.
Barely any buffering.

983
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:15,880
I've met my littlest daughter doesn't
even know what buffering is using.

984
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,280
They're just streaming.
I'm sure she knows what it is,

985
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:22,430
but she has never witnessed it.
Yeah. Well then again, you know,

986
01:01:22,431 --> 01:01:27,130
you get bad service somewhere,
get some buffering. They
weren't wrong. They, I mean,

987
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,790
they were on blockbuster, but
they just, the whole idea of like,

988
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:34,830
people like coming into blockbuster and
browsing the movies and buying the thing

989
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:36,980
is, that's true. Like we
did like doing that. Yeah.

990
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,520
But it's because we didn't have a better
option. You know, like when you go,

991
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:44,180
like even going to the store sometimes
it's kind of cool and fun, you know,

992
01:01:44,181 --> 01:01:47,570
sometimes. But most of the
time at the end of the day,

993
01:01:47,571 --> 01:01:50,060
I'd rather press a button
and go to the store.

994
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,380
I'd rather press a button
to every single time. Yeah.

995
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:58,220
And there's also that thing where you,
you're, it's a positive feedback loop,

996
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:02,150
right? It's an echo chamber. I liked going
on, you know, two of those people in the,

997
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:05,270
in the c suite of blockbuster
and account and you know,

998
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:08,660
my wife loves going down and picking out
a new movie with the kids and they love

999
01:02:08,661 --> 01:02:11,680
doing that, you know? And this was like,
yeah. You know, my kids love that too. So,

1000
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:14,690
and my teenage daughter likes doing it
too with her friends. And like you said,

1001
01:02:14,691 --> 01:02:15,690
that's cause there's no other option.

1002
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:19,130
Your teenage daughter would be rather
be in a room alone in her room clicking

1003
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,190
the next Netflix

1004
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:24,330
movie. Yep. Popping their popcorn
that got delivered earlier. Yeah.

1005
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,300
So if you,

1006
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,880
if you are on a strategy
and it's not working,

1007
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:34,200
you got to recognize that you need to
change it no to self everyone in the

1008
01:02:34,201 --> 01:02:37,200
leadership position. Pay
attention to that one. Next up.

1009
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:41,040
Number 20 soldiers when
they abide at home,

1010
01:02:41,041 --> 01:02:46,041
are maintained with fear and punishment
after when they are led to the war with

1011
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:48,300
hope and with reward.

1012
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:53,130
What's it saying is when soldiers
are confined to their quarters,

1013
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:56,150
they're kept there by fear and punishment.
When they're led to war,

1014
01:02:56,610 --> 01:02:59,610
they're led by hope and reward.
You know,

1015
01:02:59,611 --> 01:03:04,611
fear for me is just not a good
tool for a leader to use period.

1016
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:10,050
I'm not saying you never, this is, I'm
not saying you should never use it, right.

1017
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,130
There should be some element, a
little element of fear. Right.

1018
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:17,910
And does the element of fear,
right. Let me ask you this.

1019
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:22,910
Do your kids have any fear of you at
all? Cause you seem real nice. Uh, the,

1020
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,810
they do. Yeah. There's, there's just
enough, a healthy element. Yeah.

1021
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,770
I mean, I would say a
healthy, but I dunno.

1022
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,530
I don't really know what the standard
of healthy fear levels are. But yeah,

1023
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,550
we agree that there is a healthy
level of fear. Even with your kids.

1024
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:40,560
Your kids shouldn't just think that,

1025
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:44,460
that there's going to be no repercussions
for anything that they do. Yeah.

1026
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Your troops should also feel
a healthy level of fear.

1027
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:54,150
And it's hard to even use that word
because that word is so negative. Yeah.

1028
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,680
But there should at least be a level of
like, you know what, we want to do that.

1029
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:02,190
No, there's a line with Jocko
and you don't want to cross.

1030
01:04:02,191 --> 01:04:07,191
It does align with Dad Echo and
he seems real nice and all cruisy.

1031
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:12,180
I think I am a little
bit too cruisey though.

1032
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:19,580
So sometimes you do have to make sure
people understand that if they cross the

1033
01:04:21,511 --> 01:04:22,740
line,
there's going to be a problem.

1034
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:24,700
And my kids definitely understand
if they cross the line,

1035
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,690
just gonna be a problem. Yeah. That
makes sense. Yeah. It's a real product.

1036
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:32,460
Doesn't surprise me and it keeps
them in check. Yeah. Next Up,

1037
01:04:32,461 --> 01:04:34,980
20 and I'm pretty lenient.
I'm pretty cruisy.

1038
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,100
You're actually surprisingly
Cruzee and lenient.

1039
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,570
Everyone thinks I want
to be the Great Santini.

1040
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:44,130
You probably never seen that movie.
Yeah,

1041
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,980
but you don't want to raise your
kids like that. Who was the girl?

1042
01:04:49,030 --> 01:04:53,310
You don't want to be all militant and
impose discipline on your kids and make

1043
01:04:53,311 --> 01:04:58,311
them number one reliant on your
discipline instead of their discipline.

1044
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:02,460
I don't want to,
you don't want anyone like that.

1045
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:05,550
You don't want your team to be like that
where they're reliant on you barking at

1046
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:06,990
them to tell him what to do.
You don't want that,

1047
01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:08,250
then they can't function for themselves.

1048
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,400
You don't want your kids to be that
way either. When your kids to think,

1049
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:13,620
you know what,
I need to make a good decision.

1050
01:05:13,621 --> 01:05:16,410
I could slack off or I could
do what I'm supposed to do.

1051
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,130
I'm going to do what I'm
supposed to do because I know

1052
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,660
it's gonna be beneficial in the end as
opposed to I'm gonna do what I'm supposed

1053
01:05:20,661 --> 01:05:24,040
to do only because I'm afraid that my
dad's gonna yell at me or ground me or

1054
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:27,040
take away my computer or smashed
one of my favorite toys. Yeah.

1055
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,480
Yeah. You don't, you, I
mean the, the assumption,

1056
01:05:31,481 --> 01:05:34,840
I think anyway would be that
you're like more drill sergeant.

1057
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:39,550
I'm not even drill sergeant.
I'm never, I know you're not,

1058
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:43,630
but I think it's like when you look
at you or maybe what he just said,

1059
01:05:43,631 --> 01:05:48,220
like one or two sound bites and you're
like, oh, he's Joseph. There's recordings,

1060
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:53,430
many recordings of when I used to debrief
seal platoons and I'm going to try and

1061
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:59,650
get some of those. And what is it?
They're just, well, it's, it's definitely,

1062
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,190
I could see it's not
drill sergeant. He, yeah,

1063
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:07,100
but it's definitely direct and can
be pretty harsh. Yeah. At the time.

1064
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,210
So like that's what I understand people
would probably, but, but that was usually,

1065
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,470
it only be that way if somebody really
did something egregious because most of

1066
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,820
the time he'd be like, Hey,
what do you think? What do you,

1067
01:06:15,821 --> 01:06:18,160
what were you thinking about over here?
Debrief me on that. You know what I mean?

1068
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:21,610
So yeah. And it's all
contextual to like, you know,

1069
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:24,370
I guess it's kind of natural.
Like let's say I heard that right.

1070
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:26,800
I didn't really know you or nothing
and I heard that and be like, okay,

1071
01:06:26,801 --> 01:06:29,560
he's real direct and real,
real strict in like all this stuff.

1072
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:32,680
So it's just natural to be like, oh
cause he's that Kinda guy, you know,

1073
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,650
rather than kind of understand
the nuance like okay,

1074
01:06:35,651 --> 01:06:40,360
he's talking to these people
the time. Yeah. And then versus,

1075
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:43,750
but then again, then that opens it up.
Who knows that and how that you'd be,

1076
01:06:43,751 --> 01:06:48,340
so you just eat. Mine just sort of wants
to just attach what they have witnessed,

1077
01:06:48,341 --> 01:06:49,930
you know, to everything. Yeah.

1078
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:54,990
Well even drill instructors
aren't like drill instructors.

1079
01:06:55,071 --> 01:06:57,980
Yeah. I mean it's a, it's a
training methodology. Yeah.

1080
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,340
There's see purpose for the Mac that way.
See,

1081
01:07:00,341 --> 01:07:04,060
and you know that because you've been
around that type of leader isn't,

1082
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:07,630
doesn't function,
that type of leader is not good.

1083
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,290
That type of person isn't going
to function within the team. Yeah.

1084
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,810
So you can't,
you just can't be that way.

1085
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:22,150
Is there a level of intensity? Sure. Do
I bring a level of intensity sometimes?

1086
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,780
Yes. Absolutely. Yes sir.

1087
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:28,120
But that's not the way to go through life.

1088
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:30,460
Imposing discipline and
fear into your team.

1089
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,160
You'll end up with
either one of two things,

1090
01:07:33,161 --> 01:07:38,161
a broken team that relies on you for
their discipline or a team that mutinies

1091
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:43,100
against you and comes up and
kills you. Yeah. Frags you in the,

1092
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:45,650
as they did in the nom.
Alright,

1093
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:52,240
next number 21 good captains.

1094
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,660
Common never to fight the
field except necessity.

1095
01:07:55,661 --> 01:08:00,220
Constrain them and occasion call them.

1096
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:02,963
Yeah.

1097
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:07,020
So what that's saying is good. You
know, good captains, good leaders,

1098
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:11,490
never enter into the engagement
unless it's completely necessary.

1099
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,080
Okay.

1100
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:15,950
That's it. That's a great point. And
this is one of those things where

1101
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,190
if you're in a leadership position,
you shouldn't be doing the,

1102
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,870
you shouldn't be shooting
your gun at the enemy.

1103
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,620
You should be observing your team shooting
the gun and looking to see where the

1104
01:08:24,621 --> 01:08:29,250
enemy's maneuvering to. Yeah. This is, uh,
this is about detachment right here. Yeah.

1105
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,980
Don't get in the mix.
Stay detached,

1106
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:36,500
decentralized command.
Let the team maneuver,

1107
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:41,120
let them understand what the commander's
intent is and let them maneuver towards

1108
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,730
victory.
You stay back a little bit and monitor,

1109
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,810
go dive in in there.
Does that apply to,

1110
01:08:47,811 --> 01:08:50,240
cause you're the one who kind of
said this example to me one time,

1111
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,870
I forget if it was on here or
not, but you were like, um,

1112
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:58,940
it was about you when your kids tying
their shoes, you know, let's say like,

1113
01:08:58,941 --> 01:08:59,211
I don't know,

1114
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:01,880
you're late for school or we're running
late or whatever and they're having a

1115
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:05,150
hard time tying the shoes. Yeah.
You're like, let them tie the shoes.

1116
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,510
Don't jump in and be like, oh,
I'll do it. You know, kind of,

1117
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,470
I did say that and I've
said it a bunch of times.

1118
01:09:09,471 --> 01:09:14,210
That's a real simple example that's a
little bit more towards the last question

1119
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:17,330
to or towards the last discussion that we
just got into them and if you let your,

1120
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,070
if you tie your shoes for
your kids all the time,

1121
01:09:19,071 --> 01:09:21,020
they don't know what amount of
time. Yeah, and furthermore,

1122
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,960
you literally are taking
away their opportunity to
learn some fine motor skills

1123
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,710
at that moment. This is not
the same as that. This is,

1124
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:32,390
this is on a broader perspective.
Your team is doing,

1125
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,720
your team is in a firefight
and you pick up your gun,

1126
01:09:35,721 --> 01:09:37,400
you go on the front line and
you start shooting at the enemy.

1127
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:39,710
Well now who's leading right now?
I'm just looking around.

1128
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:41,420
This is the same as you know,

1129
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:46,421
you're in a business situation and your
team is trying to come up with a plan

1130
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,160
and they're arguing amongst themselves
and you jump in there and start arguing

1131
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:51,530
too.
Now you don't have a good perception of,

1132
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,190
you should be just standing back listening
to the various arguments take place.

1133
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:57,260
And I'm not talking about arguments
where people are yelling and screaming.

1134
01:09:57,261 --> 01:09:58,094
I'm talking about uh,

1135
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:01,730
a discussion where they're arguing
different possible courses of action.

1136
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:06,230
If you dive right into those and you
start becoming involved at point blank

1137
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:10,520
range, you lose all your perspective.
So instead you step back and you don't,

1138
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,770
you don't, you don't go
into the field. Yeah,

1139
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:18,680
you don't dive into the argument. You
step back and you watch the fight unfold.

1140
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,630
And then as the fight unfolds,

1141
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:25,660
you see the best options because you're
at altitude and you're not at point

1142
01:10:26,361 --> 01:10:29,290
blank range. One foot
from the enemy fire. Yeah.

1143
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,390
This is just detached,
decentralized command.

1144
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:35,450
Next up 22

1145
01:10:37,850 --> 01:10:40,970
cause that enemies caused
that the enemy's no,

1146
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:45,971
not how thou right
order vie army to fight.

1147
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,990
And in what? Soever manner.
That vow ordained stint.

1148
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:56,860
Make that the first band be
received of the second and the third

1149
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:03,080
middle English. Get something. What
are we talking about here? Well,

1150
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,310
cause your enemies no knots.

1151
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,690
That means you don't want your enemies
to understand how you're going to

1152
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:11,720
organize your, your army to
fight. That's what this is.

1153
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:15,120
You want to confuse you mean you don't
want them to know exactly what you're

1154
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:18,090
gonna do.
And then the second part,

1155
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:22,290
make it make that the first band may
be received. The second and third,

1156
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:23,910
I'm pretty sure I'm not
a hundred percent sure,

1157
01:11:23,911 --> 01:11:27,330
but I'm pretty sure that
that's just talking about
mutually supporting positions.

1158
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:30,270
So you want to set your team up so
that they can support each other.

1159
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:33,630
So confuse the enemy.

1160
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,330
Don't give up the plan and set your
teams up so they can help each other.

1161
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:40,920
Once your tea, once a team is alone
and unsupportable there alone. Mm.

1162
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:46,110
Try not to let that happen.
23

1163
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:52,170
in the fight.
Never occupy a battle to any other thing.

1164
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:57,150
Then to the same four which thou
hast appointed it, if thou will,

1165
01:11:57,151 --> 01:11:59,520
to make no disorder.

1166
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:07,190
It's a good day. It's modern English
appreciation. Well, it makes it hard too.

1167
01:12:07,210 --> 01:12:10,810
They spell even words that, you
know, they spell them all day.

1168
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:12,150
And just so you know,
you're looking at this,

1169
01:12:12,180 --> 01:12:16,740
I actually tightened up some
of the spelling and made
some of the spelling more

1170
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:20,910
modern because I just couldn't, it was
harder to track man. It's hard to attract.

1171
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,511
Again,
this,

1172
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:26,511
this thing was interpreted from Italian
in 1560 by Joe was it George White head

1173
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:32,100
was getting after the
translation. Yeah. So um,

1174
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,030
it just, it's, it's interesting
and this is the same thing.

1175
01:12:36,031 --> 01:12:39,150
You know I said that when
we did Shakespeare don't
need to do more Shakespeare,

1176
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:41,550
but people think,
oh I should just understand Shakespeare,

1177
01:12:41,551 --> 01:12:44,640
you're not going to understand stage.
It's almost a different language.

1178
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:50,150
So you need to actually break it down
like we're doing with these various

1179
01:12:50,341 --> 01:12:51,330
statements.

1180
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,540
So what this one is saying is

1181
01:12:59,490 --> 01:13:03,070
don't use a company,
don't use a,

1182
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:08,130
don't use it a unit for a purpose
other than what you've assigned it.

1183
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:12,810
Unless you want to cause disorder,
unless you want to cause chaos.

1184
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,830
So you got your team, they're assigned
to do this. Let them do that. Now,

1185
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,010
obviously that can be problematic.

1186
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:23,820
And so we need to mitigate that because
there's times when team is going to have

1187
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:26,310
to do something that
you don't want it to do.

1188
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,480
And so I'll give you a little example.

1189
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:36,540
When you're doing an assault on a target,
you have two elements,

1190
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,030
the base element and the maneuver element.

1191
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:41,790
The base element is going
to stay in position.

1192
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:46,410
They're going to sneak up on the target
and then the maneuver elements going to

1193
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:48,600
sneak over to the flank.

1194
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:52,080
And then the base elements
going to start firing.

1195
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:53,760
Massive firepower at the target.

1196
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,920
And then the maneuver
element after a little bit,

1197
01:13:55,921 --> 01:13:57,570
we'll stand up and start
to go through the target.

1198
01:13:57,571 --> 01:14:02,340
They shift fire off the target
and then you clear the target.

1199
01:14:03,990 --> 01:14:08,900
So when I was a young
gun jury,

1200
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,580
so we would, we would, you
know like let's do this. Yeah.

1201
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:13,690
So we're going to hit this target,

1202
01:14:13,691 --> 01:14:17,020
we're going to do a fire and maneuver
on this target base and maneuver.

1203
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,270
So what we would do is say,
okay,

1204
01:14:19,271 --> 01:14:23,620
let's take all of our heavy machine
guns and put them in the base element.

1205
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:29,080
And then the guys with the little pea
shooters, the little m 16 shooters,

1206
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:32,530
all those guys will be on the assault
because they're light and they'll be able

1207
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:36,160
to maneuver really quickly through the
get to the target and then go through the

1208
01:14:36,161 --> 01:14:38,590
target.
Makes perfect sense.

1209
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:42,880
And I remember the first time I presented
this type of plan to one of the old

1210
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:45,610
guys from nom, he's
like, no, don't do that.

1211
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,890
Why not master chief?

1212
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:53,140
This way we have more firepower in our
base and our maneuver guys can maneuver

1213
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:55,330
more quickly.
Here's the problem.

1214
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:58,750
When that maneuver element
is going towards the target,

1215
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:02,500
what happens if they get compromised
and contacted? And now they're that?

1216
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:04,570
They're the ones that have
to lay down their base.

1217
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:06,280
They can't get up and move
because they're being shot at.

1218
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,690
So guess who has to move?

1219
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:13,150
The base element has to move and they
can't move very well if they're only

1220
01:15:13,151 --> 01:15:16,030
getting a cover fire
from little pea shooters.

1221
01:15:16,690 --> 01:15:20,230
So you keep your integrity of your squads
and you utilize them that way and it's

1222
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:21,430
like,
oh,

1223
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:26,680
so what you want to do in this situation
is you want to make sure that your

1224
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:30,580
elements can,
are capable of doing each other's jobs,

1225
01:15:30,581 --> 01:15:34,690
maybe not to the fullest extent, but they
at least need to be somewhat capable.

1226
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:38,710
So maybe you put one machine gun and the
expected one extra machine gun and the

1227
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:41,530
expected base element and now you only
have a couple of machine guns in the

1228
01:15:41,531 --> 01:15:44,920
maneuver element, but you
got him if you need them. So

1229
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:50,740
I don't 100% agree with that.
That being said,

1230
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:54,370
you definitely want to let people do
the job that they were signed to do.

1231
01:15:55,210 --> 01:15:58,270
Make sense? Right? You've trained
them, you've assigned it, let's,

1232
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:01,310
let's try and keep the plan
as it's supposed to be. Yeah.

1233
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:07,390
To the best of our ability, but we're
thinking we're not black and white here.

1234
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:13,060
Leadership is not easy. Um,
uh, you know, another thing is

1235
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,880
when you establish your teams, you try
and use those teams for everything.

1236
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,863
If you can't,

1237
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,610
and again this is a dichotomy because
as much as you want to keep your teams

1238
01:16:24,611 --> 01:16:25,444
together,

1239
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:29,250
you also have to train them to be
split up and broken up and combined and

1240
01:16:29,260 --> 01:16:33,970
mismatched all together. And I would
always do this with all my fire teams.

1241
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:36,760
So the fire teams would stick
together as much as humanly possible.

1242
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:39,460
But guess what? I would also train them
that if they were all scrambled up,

1243
01:16:39,461 --> 01:16:40,271
someone would step up,

1244
01:16:40,271 --> 01:16:43,780
take lead and that'd be a new fire
team and we'd start making stuff happen

1245
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:51,070
next up 24
the,

1246
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:56,020
so dean accidents with
difficulty are remedied.

1247
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:00,790
Those that are thought upon with faculty.

1248
01:17:02,170 --> 01:17:04,030
I had to look up.
So Dean,

1249
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:08,140
cause I couldn't even get a
clue on what that one was,

1250
01:17:08,141 --> 01:17:12,320
but it's some sort of leader or a ruler.
It's actually a ruler.

1251
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:18,020
And this is, this is a, this is a,
so he's saying the soda in accidents,

1252
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:23,000
the leadership accidents with difficulty
are remedied, are hard to fix.

1253
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,550
When leadership screws up,
it's hard to fix.

1254
01:17:26,930 --> 01:17:30,980
Those that are fought a
pound are with difficulty,

1255
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:35,300
are remedied if you use your head quickly.

1256
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:36,831
So yeah,

1257
01:17:36,831 --> 01:17:40,280
there's going to be leadership problems
and they're hard to fix unless you think

1258
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:45,690
and think quickly.
How do you,

1259
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:49,410
how can you improve
your speed of thinking?

1260
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:54,700
Do you know how you can do
that? Practice. Practice? So

1261
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:02,470
let's say get experience to ray cause
experience gives you the practice. Yeah,

1262
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:05,550
it's experience. If I've
seen something before, it's,

1263
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:09,220
I'm going to know a thousand times
faster how I'm gonna react to it. Yeah.

1264
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:11,710
If I haven't seen it before I did.

1265
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:15,590
It takes me a while just to comprehend
what's in front of my face. Yeah.

1266
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:18,420
So that's why when we train,

1267
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:23,190
we train to throw things.
Okay. So first of all,

1268
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:27,600
when we train, we want to throw things
at people that, different scenarios,

1269
01:18:27,630 --> 01:18:30,660
different things happening, where they
start to get pattern recognition. Oh,

1270
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,800
I've seen this type of thing before.
On top of that,

1271
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:39,980
you also want to train people what to do
or how to react when they've never seen

1272
01:18:41,251 --> 01:18:44,400
it before.
Never seen anything like this before.

1273
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,330
Because if I show you,
let's say I'm training you for,

1274
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:51,500
well I guess we might as well just
use a Jujitsu tournament, right? Did,

1275
01:18:51,590 --> 01:18:54,840
you did too. I'm training you for
Jujitsu situ situations, right?

1276
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,420
I teach you how to defend this and I
teach you how to defend that and I teach

1277
01:18:57,421 --> 01:18:59,400
you how to defend this and I teach
you how to defend that, right?

1278
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:02,520
And she's Yada Fan, 10 different
things and you get pretty good at it.

1279
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:08,570
I also have to teach you a broad concept
of what to do when there's something

1280
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:14,130
that you don't recognize. So
hey, if the guy grabs your arm,

1281
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,400
I want you to pull your arm here. Hey,
if the guys starts to go for your neck,

1282
01:19:17,401 --> 01:19:20,340
I want you to swim your arm, your
hand underneath, and Tuck your chin.

1283
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,620
If the guy starts pulling
towards your back,

1284
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:25,260
I want you to shift your leg up
and so he can't move around there.

1285
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:30,060
So I'm going to give you exact
steps to execute.

1286
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:33,480
If you see these things,
and then I'm going to say this,

1287
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,800
if he's doing something you don't
recognize, here's what I want you to do.

1288
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,270
I want you to Tuck your elbows in.

1289
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:43,800
I want you to posture and I want
you to control his hips. Oh, okay.

1290
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:46,620
And then you'll start to be able
to recognize what's going on.

1291
01:19:46,621 --> 01:19:50,280
At least you're going to survive. I want
you to detach and step back and say,

1292
01:19:50,281 --> 01:19:55,260
what's he attack? Same thing with
combat. I'm going to train you like,

1293
01:19:55,261 --> 01:19:58,440
Hey, if he does this, you do that.
If he does that, you do this.

1294
01:19:59,490 --> 01:20:03,210
If you have no idea what's happening,
here's what I want you to do.

1295
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,790
Get into a 360 degree perimeter.
Listen, right? I mean,

1296
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:12,390
whatever that that
situation's gonna call for.

1297
01:20:12,391 --> 01:20:13,350
If you don't know what's happening,

1298
01:20:13,530 --> 01:20:15,750
like if I don't know where I'm getting
flanked from or if I don't know where I'm

1299
01:20:15,751 --> 01:20:19,080
getting shot at from, hey,
everyone, take a knee, get cover.

1300
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:22,260
Don't just start shooting because
that's going to cause confusion.

1301
01:20:22,261 --> 01:20:24,990
It's also going to give away our
position. Yeah. So we're going to do,

1302
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:29,160
when a go into a 360 degree perimeter,
we're going to hold what we got.

1303
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,390
We're going to listen. That's
our, that's our, that's our,

1304
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:35,640
if we don't recognize what's happening,
that's what we knew.

1305
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,150
So we have standard operating procedures
for things that we recognize and we

1306
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:43,110
actually also have something to do if we
don't recognize we have a procedure for

1307
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:47,730
nonrecognition which
is, which is important.

1308
01:20:48,180 --> 01:20:50,370
It's kind of like,
I mean it's different I guess,

1309
01:20:50,371 --> 01:20:51,840
but it kind of maybe fits in with,
you know,

1310
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:56,130
help people say expect the unexpected
kind of thing. So it kind of fits in this,

1311
01:20:56,730 --> 01:21:00,700
you're essentially trained for
unexpected stuff. Like I would say,

1312
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:02,430
I would say go one.
Yes.

1313
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:05,070
That's the important part is
not just expect the unexpected.

1314
01:21:05,310 --> 01:21:08,970
It's have a protocol for when
something unexpected happens.

1315
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:11,810
Here's what we're going to do.
Yeah.

1316
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,790
Cause a lot of times when something
unexpected, and I'm thinking,

1317
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:18,750
do you use to two right now? It's
because that's on purpose. You know,

1318
01:21:18,751 --> 01:21:21,330
like these guys with these weird games,
this weird tall,

1319
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:22,770
flexible guys or something like that.

1320
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:27,460
They have these weird games and they'll
do stuff that they know or they kind of

1321
01:21:27,461 --> 01:21:30,270
rely upon. You not have seen it
before, like you didn't see before.

1322
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:34,980
So they can capitalize when
you start to panic, you know,

1323
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:37,730
or when you can, you know, if, let's
say your arm is out here, like, um,

1324
01:21:38,730 --> 01:21:41,090
like there's some leg
locks that, that, uh,

1325
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:44,370
require you to kind of try to spin out
of it and then they'll catch you with

1326
01:21:44,371 --> 01:21:45,670
something else. Right. It's kind of that,

1327
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:50,460
so if you have a protocol
that's just like, I don't know,

1328
01:21:50,461 --> 01:21:53,030
whatever the protocol is,
safety protocol, you know,

1329
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:58,310
it not only keeps you safe
just statistically speaking,

1330
01:21:58,351 --> 01:22:01,820
you know, chances are it'll keep you
safe, but it'll jam up their game. Yeah.

1331
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,220
Overall, you know, especially
these people that, that they, they,

1332
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:07,110
they capitalize on you panicking and not,

1333
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:11,240
yeah. Do you want to have
some kind of a reset position?

1334
01:22:11,241 --> 01:22:14,900
And I used to use this with
fighters. Like, Hey, here's
your reset position. Like,

1335
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:18,320
just get to hear, cause you're
comfortable there. Get them under control,

1336
01:22:18,321 --> 01:22:22,520
control their hips, whatever. Combat.
Same thing. Oh, you're, you're, you're,

1337
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:25,640
everyone's confused. Everyone's mixed
up. Guys are all over the place.

1338
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:29,750
Let's get to a reset position
in a building and now
everyone knows where we are.

1339
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:33,800
We get a control of results.
Business. Same thing we got.

1340
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,110
We got scenario that we
don't know what's happening.

1341
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:38,660
You know what general corridors like,
Hey,

1342
01:22:38,661 --> 01:22:40,670
we're all going to go
to our normal positions.

1343
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:43,130
We're going to stand by cause we
don't know what's happening, right?

1344
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:47,420
So you've got to have not
just to expect the unexpected,

1345
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:51,020
you've got to have a protocol to follow
when something is occurring that you

1346
01:22:51,021 --> 01:22:55,310
don't understand yet.
Some kind of a reset position.

1347
01:22:56,030 --> 01:23:00,170
Put that in your world.
Next up,

1348
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:02,960
number 25 men,
iron,

1349
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:06,520
money and bread be the
strength of the war.

1350
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,530
But of these four,

1351
01:23:08,710 --> 01:23:13,710
the first to be most necessary because
men and iron find money and bread,

1352
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:20,650
but money and bread.
Find not men and iron.

1353
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:25,990
Yeah, that one's pretty, pretty cool.
Pretty self explanatory. Now let me,

1354
01:23:25,991 --> 01:23:30,400
let's go to a business perspective here.
A business perspective here,

1355
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:35,620
because this is a, this can help people
make decisions in the business world.

1356
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:40,390
When you're going to
make expand expenditures,

1357
01:23:40,450 --> 01:23:44,470
when you are going to invest
in something in your company,

1358
01:23:46,830 --> 01:23:51,830
it is important to assess whether or not
you are investing in something that is

1359
01:23:53,821 --> 01:23:58,821
going to help you build
is going to help you grow.

1360
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,450
Or if you're investing in something
that is not. So for instance,

1361
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:08,370
let's say let's say hey are are
we could either take you know,

1362
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,520
$50,000 and remodel our current office
or we can take $50,000 and we can rent

1363
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,970
this new sub office in an area
that we don't have any, um,

1364
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:25,080
presence in.
So which one is a better investment?

1365
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:28,350
Like we don't really need
that remodel of our office.

1366
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,200
This other thing is going
to help us actually grow.

1367
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:34,770
So make sure that the
investments that you're making,

1368
01:24:34,771 --> 01:24:37,980
the first thing you want to
invest in his men and iron, right?

1369
01:24:38,220 --> 01:24:41,550
You don't want to invest in money and
bread, money and Brad's going to be gone.

1370
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:46,140
Yeah. And it doesn't reproduce.
It doesn't reproduce itself.

1371
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,980
Whereas men and steel is going to get
you more of that bread and iron in the

1372
01:24:49,981 --> 01:24:52,440
long run. Or sorry. Bread and money.

1373
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:54,613
Okay.

1374
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:56,640
All right.
Number 26

1375
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:58,560
okay.

1376
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,560
The unarmed rich man is a
booty to the poor soldier.

1377
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:10,030
What does that mean? It means
that the unarmed Richman
is the prize of, of course,

1378
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,560
ultra. That sort of means
it means, it means be armed

1379
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:20,710
and this is the last one.
Number 27

1380
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:27,660
a costume vice soldiers to despise
delicate living and luxurious apparel.

1381
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:35,710
I liked that one. Mm hmm. What
does that mean? Get your people.

1382
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:39,490
Get your soldiers to
despise delicate living.

1383
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:44,950
Despise Comfort,
despise luxurious clothing.

1384
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:48,010
That's what I'm talking about.
They'll be better soldiers.

1385
01:25:48,011 --> 01:25:52,390
They'll be better people. Understand you
feel like I'm talking to you right now.

1386
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:54,340
What the Connoisseur of comfort,

1387
01:25:54,910 --> 01:25:59,530
comfort is in my firing line
right now. Yeah, I dig it, man.

1388
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:03,190
I think obviously I can't disagree
with that because Dang me.

1389
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:07,940
Yeah. When you've been uncomfortable
for an extended period of time,

1390
01:26:07,941 --> 01:26:11,930
does it not make you a better
person? A little bit. Yeah,
it does. There we go. Yeah.

1391
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:16,340
You know the whole idea of be comfortable.
You've told me the story of you,

1392
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:18,110
because I know it doesn't rain a lot here,

1393
01:26:18,111 --> 01:26:21,500
but you used your kettle bells in the
rain and the other day you told me that

1394
01:26:21,501 --> 01:26:26,090
story two times, two days in
a row now. Sure. Right? Yes.

1395
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:29,030
Yeah.
Today you told me that even jade,

1396
01:26:29,031 --> 01:26:32,540
your brother came out and was
impressed by your determination

1397
01:26:34,650 --> 01:26:35,930
commitment.
So what is it,

1398
01:26:36,170 --> 01:26:40,760
what is it about that that made you
feel compelled to tell me about it?

1399
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:43,070
And B, you know, for
lack of a better word,

1400
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:47,900
pretty damn proud that you went out in
the rain and did a kettle bell workout

1401
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:52,860
and the cold. Uh, yes.
Well, yeah, it's Straw it.

1402
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:57,290
And how did you feel inside strong
when it was over? It felt better. Yeah.

1403
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:59,210
This is it. Well, yeah,
it makes it stronger.

1404
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,790
I'm asking you real questions right now.
It might seem like I'm joking,

1405
01:27:01,791 --> 01:27:05,420
but it's actually real. You know why?
Because this is a little step for you.

1406
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:10,220
And there's other people
that are listening that would
benefit from hearing how

1407
01:27:10,310 --> 01:27:13,520
taking this little step
away from comfort really,

1408
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:17,240
truly made you mentally
and physically better.

1409
01:27:17,330 --> 01:27:18,530
Go Echo Charles.

1410
01:27:19,150 --> 01:27:23,920
Well, the, wow, what can I
start on that one? Okay. So,

1411
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:28,060
okay. Yes. I go outside
out of workout planned.

1412
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:33,310
It's raining, raining kind of hard
too, by the way. And it's kind of cold.

1413
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:37,000
The kind you got to wear like a
lot of clothes, you know? So yes,

1414
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:40,660
I go ahead and do the whole workout hard
too. And yes, my brother was like, Dang,

1415
01:27:40,661 --> 01:27:44,710
that's some dedication and whatever.
But yes, the, so the feeling is yeah,

1416
01:27:44,711 --> 01:27:48,590
that I'm actually strong now. You
know, it's like basically when you,

1417
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:51,160
when you break it down, it's like
now you're strong, you're not weak.

1418
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:55,810
So weak would be like, just the littlest
thing will throw you off your plan.

1419
01:27:55,930 --> 01:27:56,350
You know,

1420
01:27:56,350 --> 01:28:00,400
the littlest thing because you can't
because you're so used to comfort where

1421
01:28:00,401 --> 01:28:03,670
you're still used to like the
clothing thing. I mean, yeah,

1422
01:28:03,671 --> 01:28:07,720
that's kind of weird too. Like if you
always gotta be wearing nice clothes,

1423
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:10,480
otherwise like you're kind of, you
don't go out or something. I Dunno,

1424
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,810
but it's Kinda the say seems
like the same concept. But yeah,

1425
01:28:13,811 --> 01:28:15,190
if you can endure that stuff

1426
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:18,250
and then how do you feel when
you're done better? Yeah.

1427
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:22,220
Did you feel better after a workout in
the cold rain where you went and got

1428
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:27,200
after it then you would have had it
been just normal 70 degrees and sunny.

1429
01:28:27,201 --> 01:28:27,890
So cow.

1430
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:32,610
Yeah, a little bit, but
I feel like, um, it's,

1431
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,880
it was just more of a psychological thing,

1432
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:38,540
which does help big time
because now you know that rain,

1433
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:42,230
you just proved to yourself that rain,
cold, whatever, is not an excuse.

1434
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:47,070
How old are you for two years?

1435
01:28:47,071 --> 01:28:50,970
Rain and cold as an excuse. No more,
no more. Well, here's the thing,

1436
01:28:50,971 --> 01:28:55,480
going to battle. You know, it's funny.
Here's a good, here's a good expression.

1437
01:28:55,481 --> 01:28:59,730
You used to saying that derives peregrine
occurred when it was raining and cold.

1438
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:04,740
You know, we'd say good weather,
but it was like a, it was kind of,

1439
01:29:04,741 --> 01:29:05,574
it's true.

1440
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:10,740
It's definitely true because when it's
raining and when it's cold, guess what?

1441
01:29:10,741 --> 01:29:15,060
The people that are, you know
on watch your enemy, guess
what they're doing there.

1442
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,360
They're hiding. They're all bundled up
and warm, so that makes it easier for you.

1443
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:21,360
Plus there's noise from the rain,

1444
01:29:21,361 --> 01:29:26,361
which camouflage is the noise that you're
making walking through the j or the

1445
01:29:26,941 --> 01:29:30,540
woods or whatever. But that's
always a good one. Whenever it's,

1446
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:35,490
whenever it's crappy weather.
I was, I was say to myself,

1447
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:39,630
good operating whether kind of smile, but
we used to say two genders, that's like,

1448
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:44,010
you can't complain about it. You just
look at your buddy. It's like when you,

1449
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:49,170
when the door of the t of the Hilo truck,
you know to Hilo truck is no,

1450
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:53,610
back in the day we didn't have a lot
of money for budget and so we'd pretend

1451
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:57,090
that we were in helicopters and we'd be
in the back of big trucks and they just

1452
01:29:57,091 --> 01:30:00,960
drive out in the middle of the desert or
open up the Hilo truck and open it up,

1453
01:30:00,990 --> 01:30:03,880
open up the door, and we jump out. Like
we just got out of a helicopter, right?

1454
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:08,070
Little did we know that
when the war actually came,

1455
01:30:08,130 --> 01:30:11,510
we would be using vehicles. We used
vehicles all the time. We, Bree,

1456
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:13,410
I rarely,

1457
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:17,580
rarely used helicopters
in Iraq and Afghanistan.

1458
01:30:17,581 --> 01:30:20,700
They used helicopters a lot more,
but for me and Iraq,

1459
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:23,160
foot patrol and he load trucks,

1460
01:30:23,190 --> 01:30:24,630
but we didn't have to call
them Hilo trucks anymore.

1461
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:26,930
Now we just called them
trucks. Sure, sure.

1462
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:32,750
But when you're in a Hilo truck in 1994
and you get driven up into the wherever

1463
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,200
and that door of the Hilo truck opens out,

1464
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:40,920
opens up and it's raining and it's cold.

1465
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:43,950
And as you're getting out of the truck,

1466
01:30:43,951 --> 01:30:47,160
your last moment to communicate
out loud to everyone,

1467
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,730
you hear someone go good operating
other and you're like, yeah, it is.

1468
01:30:50,731 --> 01:30:54,780
This is going to suck. Yeah. And
it makes sense. So like, yeah,

1469
01:30:54,781 --> 01:30:59,781
if you're used to being uncomfortable
or if you like despise comfort,

1470
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:05,210
however you put it, it's not me. They,

1471
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,970
Machiavelli said despise comfort,
despising comfort.

1472
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:13,320
Essentially. You're getting
comfortable with being uncomfortable.

1473
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,800
You know how they say that, right?
They do. They do. Man. So yeah,

1474
01:31:16,801 --> 01:31:18,540
that's what they're doing.
So that's why, yeah. Yeah.

1475
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,810
Just improve it basically at the end of
the day improves your chances of success,

1476
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:26,670
you know, may, uh, roadblocks of
discomfort come about in the future.

1477
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:28,830
That's what happened. Indeed. And I,

1478
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:34,410
I think that not only will the rejection
of comfort make better soldiers,

1479
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,790
it'll make better people. So yes, as
you said, get out of your comfort zone,

1480
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:45,200
impose discipline and discomfort on
yourself and you will become a better

1481
01:31:48,991 --> 01:31:49,824
person.

1482
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:57,450
And that wraps up Machiavelli for now.
But Echo,

1483
01:31:57,451 --> 01:31:58,171
speaking of,

1484
01:31:58,171 --> 01:32:02,710
I'm getting out of our comfort zone and
this is going to be a little dichotomy

1485
01:32:02,711 --> 01:32:03,544
here,

1486
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,230
but getting out of our
comfort zone to become better,

1487
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:13,390
what recommendations do you have for
us to make that happen? Like I said,

1488
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:17,190
there's gonna be a dichotomy here.
Okay. Cause what do we have? Well,

1489
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:21,030
well, there's a lot of things
you have, but, but yes, so, uh,

1490
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,570
being the connoisseur of comfort.

1491
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:28,090
And so you're kind of the kind of
of discomfort really, in a way.

1492
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:30,100
I don't know about that.
Here's the thing though,

1493
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:33,910
I don't think about it much though.
You know what I mean?

1494
01:32:33,940 --> 01:32:38,380
I'd have to be like actively thinking
about it. Discomfort, just about anything.

1495
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:43,150
I'm just over here doing what I'm doing.
They know what I mean with discomfort,

1496
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,000
just capability. I don't
care. I don't care.

1497
01:32:47,380 --> 01:32:52,150
There's that old viking saying
he's like the rain is cold and old.

1498
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:54,520
Viking says,
how can the rain be cold?

1499
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:01,850
Right. The rain's not cold. Yeah,
but I don't know. I don't get it.

1500
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:06,760
How can the rain be cold if
it's cold, Ben? It's cold. No,

1501
01:33:06,770 --> 01:33:09,310
it's cold to you when it hits you.
The rain itself hasn't called.

1502
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:12,730
That's a play on words.
Little plan word.

1503
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,320
That's another good
thing to think yourself.

1504
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:19,310
Another good thing do you think to
yourself, you only get wet once. Yeah,

1505
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:24,410
I've talked about that before. Yeah, you,
you're waiting to go across the river.

1506
01:33:24,411 --> 01:33:27,770
You're looking for the best spot.
You're like, oh nope. Just get wet.

1507
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,020
You only get one at one time.
Once you're wet, you're wet.

1508
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:34,100
It doesn't matter if it's true, so
like suck it up. The comfort thing is,

1509
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:37,010
it's all,
it's like context is a huge,

1510
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:42,310
has a lot to do with it. Remember how
I told you that time where it's like,

1511
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:45,220
you know, sometimes you can
just fall asleep on the floor.

1512
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,640
I know we're in the beach,
but then sometimes you get in,

1513
01:33:48,641 --> 01:33:51,880
you're on your couch or wherever
and you just can't fall asleep,

1514
01:33:51,881 --> 01:33:53,700
can get comfortable and stuff,
you know,

1515
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:57,970
because you expect that
comfort is what I'm saying.

1516
01:33:58,240 --> 01:34:02,620
But if you don't have any comfortable
expectations, it's like you just be,

1517
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,670
you're just comfortable.

1518
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:05,950
It's almost like you're just
appreciative for any kind of comfort.

1519
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:11,140
But if you expect mass comfort, it's like
you can't get enough comfort, you know,

1520
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:16,260
cause you just expect more. It's
weird. So like, like, um, okay, so you,

1521
01:34:16,261 --> 01:34:19,590
you know, you have experience with
cold water, right? Getting it nickel,

1522
01:34:19,640 --> 01:34:24,100
hit the surf. So when you're
there, how hard is that?

1523
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,790
Just not, not right. You're just
like, we're just doing it. Yeah.

1524
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:31,150
This is what we're doing. This is, we're,
we're whatever, it's cold. It sucks,

1525
01:34:31,151 --> 01:34:35,980
whatever. Even if it's, but in
the, this is me keep in mind,

1526
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:40,010
but still I think it holds true. So I'm
getting in the shower the other day.

1527
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:44,330
It's cold here, California,
whether it's, go tell that to Pete.

1528
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:48,520
Well Pete's gonna understand because he,
this probably happened to him too.

1529
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:52,000
So listen, you know how you're cold,
you know like it's just sort of cold.

1530
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:56,020
So someone had to take a shower
and you know the kind of,

1531
01:34:56,021 --> 01:34:58,010
when you turn on the shower
it's not just doesn't come

1532
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,220
out all warm. It got it. It takes
a few seconds or whatever. So,

1533
01:35:01,610 --> 01:35:04,790
so I turned it on and hits me.
Oh cause you take warm showers

1534
01:35:08,450 --> 01:35:12,350
that day. I should do a warm
shower. Anyone understood. Anyway,

1535
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,190
the cold water like kind
of hit me and I was,

1536
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:19,260
oh there's no way I could bear going
underneath that showered like before it

1537
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:23,900
gets warm. No way man. No Way. But
then, and then whatever it heats up.

1538
01:35:23,901 --> 01:35:25,130
But I'm thinking like,
no,

1539
01:35:25,131 --> 01:35:29,540
like Jocko guys go in that
cold surf like for a long time.

1540
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:33,920
And so then I'm thinking, oh it's
totally in context. You know, like if I,

1541
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,070
let's say a minute before I
walked in the shower, I was like,

1542
01:35:37,071 --> 01:35:41,510
I'm going to take a cold shower right now
doing it literally the same exact time

1543
01:35:43,060 --> 01:35:46,910
I can do it. You see what I'm saying?
So it's like a mindset kind of thing,

1544
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:50,030
Jack, even aside from
the training, of course,

1545
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:54,980
I would say this and the reason that
I can't me, it's just like blank.

1546
01:35:55,490 --> 01:36:00,410
No, it's not here. Maybe it
is real, but no, I dunno.

1547
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:03,800
Thinking about this when you get
out of bed, right? Well then again,

1548
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:06,630
your routine's different, but yeah,
let's say you're just sort of,

1549
01:36:06,750 --> 01:36:10,340
I have an actual ice bath.
Yeah, but that's different
to a bright, he said, Dick,

1550
01:36:10,341 --> 01:36:13,130
I spent the whole time. Okay.
But that's the what I'm saying.

1551
01:36:13,131 --> 01:36:16,310
Like what if you get out of no out of
bed or you're just cruising at home,

1552
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:20,540
which you probably don't do, but let's
say you were, and it was just cold.

1553
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:22,250
The kind like heart and
pretty cold right now.

1554
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:27,020
I shouldn't put on a jacket right
now. Let's Hoodie. Whatever.

1555
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:30,590
That's how cold it is right here, right?
Not Freezing, but just I'm cold right now.

1556
01:36:30,591 --> 01:36:31,550
Uncomfortably cold.

1557
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:37,270
And then let's say your son comes with
a cup of ice water and dumps it on you.

1558
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:43,010
Right? How'd you sneak up on
me? It's like you're saying,

1559
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:46,400
okay, maybe it didn't sneak up
on you. Maybe he was, I dunno,

1560
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:48,310
but let's say he poured ice water idea.
Okay.

1561
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:51,200
You're just telling me that you're
like whatever. That wouldn't,

1562
01:36:51,830 --> 01:36:56,330
you'd be Viking like can be like whoa.
Like I dunno, it's not cold. Well,

1563
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:00,300
I tell you, if he was looking for a
reaction from me, I wouldn't get it right.

1564
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:02,690
Which I dig.
I dig it.

1565
01:37:02,691 --> 01:37:06,250
There would be a grappling match
happening real quick though. Yeah. Yeah.

1566
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:10,400
And I understand is an
attack. Okay. So that aside,

1567
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:15,020
I'm talking about the actual
cold water, but it's, so,

1568
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:18,410
it's not nothing, but it's
something, but it's something.

1569
01:37:18,950 --> 01:37:22,850
But that compare that experience
to, if he came up to day, Hey dad,

1570
01:37:22,851 --> 01:37:25,790
I have this cup of cold water.
It's kind of cold right now.

1571
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:29,180
Do you think you can like endure this?
Right? And you were like, Oh yeah,

1572
01:37:29,181 --> 01:37:31,250
I can endure it, do it. And he did it.

1573
01:37:31,940 --> 01:37:33,500
I'm not saying now it'd
be nothing or something.

1574
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:37,280
I'm saying that those two experiences
are different. Okay. Yeah.

1575
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:37,990
See what I'm saying?

1576
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:42,290
So this is the element of surprise
is that we're talking about one year.

1577
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:43,460
Was his surprise wonder or not?

1578
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:46,910
If your surprise it going to
throw you off a little bit. Yeah.

1579
01:37:47,010 --> 01:37:49,550
If you're not surprised, your brace
for it, you're good to go. Yeah.

1580
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:50,450
I mean as surprise.

1581
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:54,960
That's just one element of a different
context where you don't necessarily exist.

1582
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:59,280
It's surprise and mental preparation.
Mental preparation is,

1583
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:03,330
I think the overarching cause surprise
would fall under the mental preparation

1584
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,040
stuff going on in your head,

1585
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:10,410
telling you that shower experience kind
of in linkedin being a little bit anyway.

1586
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:15,450
Okay. Be comfortable with being
uncomfortable. That's a Jujitsu sang too,

1587
01:38:15,451 --> 01:38:17,940
by the way.
Is that where you heard him mainly?

1588
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:23,280
Maybe that's where I first heard it.
Yeah, because that's a good thing to have.

1589
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:24,263
Oh yeah,
that's the,

1590
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:29,160
that's the backhanded compliment that
Hixon Gracie told me when I rolled with

1591
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:33,870
him back in the day that
you were comfortable. He
goes, he said, you're very,

1592
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:37,150
you're very comfortable when
you're in a really bad position.

1593
01:38:39,190 --> 01:38:43,260
And I was all happy. There you
go. Seems good at Jujitsu. Yes.

1594
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:48,180
So that's what I heard too. Um, but
yeah, so that's what you did to saying.

1595
01:38:48,181 --> 01:38:51,870
So that means dude,
you did to kind of really yes.

1596
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:55,260
Last strategy or or what,
what do you call it? Rules.

1597
01:38:55,261 --> 01:39:00,261
General rule is essentially
despise delicate living is Jujitsu.

1598
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:05,460
Delicate living and then we'll, it is not,
it's not delicate, but it's not brutal.

1599
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:09,410
It depends where you roll with.
Yeah, that's true. That's very true.

1600
01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:13,590
There's some blood on the mat last
night, boy, I believe. Anyway.

1601
01:39:13,591 --> 01:39:16,590
Did you get to ifs?
If we're not in Jujitsu already,

1602
01:39:16,620 --> 01:39:21,620
we might not agree on the different
mindsets for cold and all that.

1603
01:39:22,170 --> 01:39:26,130
But we do agree. Do some digits. Do just
some judges too. And when you do it,

1604
01:39:26,131 --> 01:39:29,820
you're going to need a g and what grade
you get none other than thingies that

1605
01:39:29,821 --> 01:39:34,740
are made a hundred percent in America
from top to bottom, from origin, origin,

1606
01:39:34,741 --> 01:39:36,810
main.com.
That's where you get them.

1607
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:40,830
You can get whatever you want on there
and you can get a rash guard so you can

1608
01:39:40,831 --> 01:39:41,830
do no gay as well.

1609
01:39:41,940 --> 01:39:46,940
And then you can get a tee shirts
and hoodies which are comfortable,

1610
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:48,203
which,

1611
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:53,780
which are the antithesis of what we're
talking about because you have claimed

1612
01:39:54,991 --> 01:39:59,910
and now this claim has been supported
on a social media sites around the world

1613
01:40:01,200 --> 01:40:04,800
that the origin jogger pants,
which I don't,

1614
01:40:04,801 --> 01:40:09,550
where are universally the most
comfortable pants of all time. Yes,

1615
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:11,850
there are still,
I mean,

1616
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:16,910
and I went on searches like my son got
a pair for Christmas cause you know when

1617
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:18,810
you're in my family,
guess what you're getting for Christmas

1618
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,160
products or just stuff.

1619
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:27,660
So he got a pair and I tried them on and
he was like, you got to take a bottle.

1620
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:31,500
They were like, cause how they looked
because they just don't, they're just not,

1621
01:40:31,530 --> 01:40:32,760
they're not, it's not me. Yeah.

1622
01:40:32,761 --> 01:40:36,420
Cause joggers as functional as they are
because they're super functional as far

1623
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:40,890
as jogging and running as
functional as they are there.

1624
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:43,680
That's a style thing.
Like they're in style right now,

1625
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:47,910
but they're somehow
related to skinny jeans.

1626
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:52,830
Are they not there? At least that's
the look. Yeah. Related. So you,

1627
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:54,550
yeah, you can't wear
skin. That kind of stuff.

1628
01:40:54,870 --> 01:40:59,140
Used to issue when I was at seal team
two seal team one we didn't have at seal

1629
01:40:59,141 --> 01:41:03,790
team two they issued us joggers,
but this is back in the day.

1630
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,020
They were basically like,

1631
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,910
they were basically like the same thing
because it was cold in the winter time

1632
01:41:09,911 --> 01:41:12,470
and guys would want to run
with those things on. Yeah.

1633
01:41:12,970 --> 01:41:14,080
But I didn't wear those either.

1634
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:19,540
But everyone else more weight and their
outer where they weren't underwear where

1635
01:41:19,541 --> 01:41:24,250
I'm like over your running
shorts. Oh, okay. Yeah. Cool.

1636
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,230
There you go. Yeah. But these are,

1637
01:41:26,290 --> 01:41:29,590
these are probably going to be way
more comfortable going from origin. Um,

1638
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:32,350
and they're made in America by the way.
I don't know if I mentioned that,

1639
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:36,900
but yeah, those are good geography. Here's
the thing. You despise come for a while.

1640
01:41:36,901 --> 01:41:40,210
I don't think you despise come.
Not as much as I showed the, okay.

1641
01:41:40,211 --> 01:41:43,600
That makes sense to me. I don't
despise comfort. Just like,

1642
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:48,490
I don't despise the rest between sets
because comfort is there for a reason when

1643
01:41:48,491 --> 01:41:51,550
you're kind of cold. I guess that's
what I was gonna say earlier.

1644
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:56,640
You enjoy comfort more when you
have discomfort. Yes. Right.

1645
01:41:56,740 --> 01:42:00,550
Oh, you don't want to be the person
that's constantly in a feather pillow

1646
01:42:00,790 --> 01:42:02,990
temperature controlled scenario.
Right?

1647
01:42:03,050 --> 01:42:06,580
You want to be in like the tough
environment and then you're like, oh,

1648
01:42:06,581 --> 01:42:07,630
this feels good now.

1649
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,870
Like when you get out of the one
you've been surfing and it's cold.

1650
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:15,670
I went surfing the other
day with no wetsuit on and
it's winter time here by the

1651
01:42:15,671 --> 01:42:17,490
way. But one of my, uh,

1652
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:22,150
to actually have my toes
were numb straight white.

1653
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,100
So how cold does that? Maybe like
what, 55 something like that? Yeah.

1654
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:29,400
I mean I only went for like 45 minutes,
but yeah,

1655
01:42:29,401 --> 01:42:34,401
it was cold when I got done and
then I went in the Jacuzzi it,

1656
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:38,590
it felt good to see it
not despise that comfort,

1657
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:43,240
but it felt even better than if it
was just a normal day and I wasn't,

1658
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:45,200
didn't have a num two toes.

1659
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:50,440
So really it's more about the
ability to endure discomfort.

1660
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:55,030
That's really what it is. So the light,
the less time you spend uncomfortable,

1661
01:42:55,180 --> 01:42:58,420
the less used to it, you'll
be. So Lamar or like, you know,

1662
01:42:59,140 --> 01:43:02,680
the less capable you'll
be of enduring it Kinda,

1663
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:06,850
that's kind of the thing. Yeah.
Check what they're going for anyway.

1664
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:11,320
[inaudible] guards, tee shirts,
joggers, uh, supplements,

1665
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:13,540
supplements of course,
joint supplements,

1666
01:43:13,541 --> 01:43:18,220
which have shaken up to be the most
important supplements there are per day.

1667
01:43:18,221 --> 01:43:23,221
It's true indeed for a semi to
moderate to highly active person.

1668
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:29,380
That's it. Yeah, I know this firsthand.
Definitely. Uh, so joint warfare,

1669
01:43:29,650 --> 01:43:34,030
Krill oil, those are for your
joints and for your whole life.

1670
01:43:34,031 --> 01:43:37,420
Like this stuff that's in joint warfare,

1671
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:42,970
Tumeric, it has all, all kinds.
It's not just like, yeah,
it's good for your joints,

1672
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:46,810
but it's good for a little, it's good
for everything. Yeah. Which is, as I was

1673
01:43:48,430 --> 01:43:51,890
reading more about it or no,
there was an article that spring up,

1674
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:53,990
that's what it was. And I was like, wow,
I didn't know that. Did all of this.

1675
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:57,640
No wonder. I feel so good. Anyway. Joan,

1676
01:43:57,660 --> 01:44:01,640
where for Krill oil discipline, there's
also so discipline comes in lemon lime,

1677
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:03,590
which is tasty.
There's also the new

1678
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:07,880
tropic thunder because I couldn't call it,

1679
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:10,880
we couldn't call it Pina Colada
cause that just not happening.

1680
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:16,010
That was just a big negative.
And then there's milk of course,

1681
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:20,570
additional protein,
additional protein that tastes delicious.

1682
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:22,870
It tastes like a dessert.
A for real dessert.

1683
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:26,450
And if you have kids or if you just,

1684
01:44:26,810 --> 01:44:29,300
well if you have kids you
get them a warrior kid milk,

1685
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,000
which is the best possible thing you
can buy a child for food in my opinion.

1686
01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:37,070
Yeah, it tastes well. I
guess if you give him steak,

1687
01:44:38,750 --> 01:44:40,360
I think vegetables are good too.

1688
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,280
I didn't even like steak when I was
a little kid. Yeah, you like burgers.

1689
01:44:43,281 --> 01:44:47,890
I like Burgers, but yeah, you're
more refined now. It's luxurious.

1690
01:44:47,940 --> 01:44:52,580
No though is an acquired taste getting
into the steak thing, Huh? Yeah.

1691
01:44:52,581 --> 01:44:56,630
Interesting. Plus I had to learn
how to cook it better, so yeah,

1692
01:44:56,780 --> 01:45:00,440
warrior kid milk and all that stuff
from origin you can get it. Origin,

1693
01:45:00,441 --> 01:45:05,120
main.com.com also,
chuck was a store,

1694
01:45:05,150 --> 01:45:07,040
it's called Jocko store,

1695
01:45:07,370 --> 01:45:12,370
so you go to [inaudible] dot com and
this is where you can get shirts that

1696
01:45:12,891 --> 01:45:16,010
represented the path. I want to
represent discipline equals freedom.

1697
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:20,030
This winning equals freedom shirt here,
and this is what I realized this cycle.

1698
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:23,900
I know, I know. I think maybe
a little bit too much into it,

1699
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:28,901
but this happened though when you were a
discipline equals freedom shirt to work

1700
01:45:29,141 --> 01:45:33,740
out you like won't skip the work. You'll
be more into the workout. I noticed that.

1701
01:45:33,790 --> 01:45:37,520
Yeah, because you look at it and says
discipline equals freedom. You know,

1702
01:45:37,521 --> 01:45:39,890
it's like you're representing
what it's actually saying.

1703
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:41,660
It's not one of these
deals where it's like, Ooh,

1704
01:45:41,661 --> 01:45:45,440
a cool star on your shirt or something.
Which is cool.

1705
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:49,430
There's people that have taken that
idea to the next level and gotten the

1706
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:52,340
discipline equals freedom.
Tattoos see,

1707
01:45:52,341 --> 01:45:57,160
same exact concept and yet I've seen
it in like a one dude has the desperate

1708
01:45:57,161 --> 01:46:00,320
goes freedom. I think it's, it's basically
on the inside of his wrist. Yeah.

1709
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:05,150
Try eating a doughnut with that hand.
It's not exactly that. Just no way.

1710
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:08,750
That's exactly. If that happened,
you'd be in serious violation,

1711
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:10,610
like you couldn't do it.
You'd feel it.

1712
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:14,950
You'd be doing burpees for like
45 minutes after that. Yeah.

1713
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,190
You see an I posted a picture of the
guy with it on the inside of, yeah.

1714
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:21,780
No. Well there's one guy
that has an on subs arm.

1715
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,280
You're talking about the one guy. There's
a guy that has one was wrist. Yeah,

1716
01:46:24,290 --> 01:46:28,620
but that's the one stamp. It was
that roll call. Yeah, that was put,

1717
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:31,310
I took the picture, but yeah,
I saw that. It was good. See,

1718
01:46:31,311 --> 01:46:34,910
same exact concept because yeah,
you can't not represent.

1719
01:46:34,940 --> 01:46:37,790
Now you know that the shirt
on, boom, you got the tattoo.

1720
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:41,930
Now you can never know represent or are
you going to pay the price to yourself

1721
01:46:41,931 --> 01:46:45,900
by the way. So it's like a thing. I
dig it, man. I dig it. Respect. Also,

1722
01:46:45,901 --> 01:46:47,180
we get that tattoo.

1723
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:52,260
I think you should only
get that tattoo if you,

1724
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:57,190
if you're, you need to
commit first, right?

1725
01:46:57,510 --> 01:47:00,220
Then you commit first
and then get the tattoo.

1726
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:04,430
Don't think that just the Tattoo's going
to push you over the edge even though

1727
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,530
probably will,
even though it probably,

1728
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:09,630
maybe that's not the best approach for
a tattoo. Uh, decision making is that,

1729
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:13,810
that's what you're saying anyway. It's
called Jocko store.com. You can get your,

1730
01:47:13,870 --> 01:47:17,430
uh, you know the shirts and,
and before you get the tattoo,

1731
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:21,550
get the t shirt and a hat.
A hat has it first.

1732
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:24,250
There's a lot of fear in the game.
Cool.

1733
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:28,750
Then you can step it up a little bit
more. Hoodies. Yes. Women's stuff.

1734
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:32,810
I'm going to have some new stuff on
there too. You keep saying that. I know,

1735
01:47:32,811 --> 01:47:34,850
but I'm going to do it.
Meanwhile,

1736
01:47:34,851 --> 01:47:39,610
there's their patches right now or are
we out of patches? Oh Wow. I don't know.

1737
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:41,260
Let me,
let me double check and the check.

1738
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:44,500
Let me check with the guy that's in
charge of an, Oh wait, that's you.

1739
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:51,550
Well, rest assured. Hey, if you
see something cool, get something.

1740
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:55,740
If something's sold out or something
like that, I don't know. Let me know.

1741
01:47:55,790 --> 01:48:00,580
I guess it won't be, or it'll be on
the way. Either way. It's called Jocko,

1742
01:48:00,581 --> 01:48:02,170
store.com.
A lot of cool stuff on there.

1743
01:48:02,171 --> 01:48:05,680
If you want something you
want to represent in the
wild in the wild by the way,

1744
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:11,290
get something also Jocko white tea on the
story that we saw that on the store to

1745
01:48:11,291 --> 01:48:16,270
buy the one. Um, but you can
get this. Yeah it's good.

1746
01:48:16,450 --> 01:48:18,760
Can get it from Amazon as well.
Where else?

1747
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:25,460
Guess what I'm drinking right
now. Hot Tea. Yeah. You know why?

1748
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:29,750
Comfortable cause concept a
little bit cold down in Boston.

1749
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:35,660
Yeah, it makes sense. You're no stranger
to the discomfort so I think you can,

1750
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:36,990
you know, whatever. But yeah,

1751
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:41,690
it's one of those deals where even
if you don't like tea that much,

1752
01:48:41,750 --> 01:48:46,750
you'll probably like this was doesn't
it tastes like tea but it doesn't taste

1753
01:48:46,971 --> 01:48:50,780
like tea. It's can I say that? Does
that make any sense? If you drink it,

1754
01:48:50,781 --> 01:48:53,990
that makes it a dichotomy. There's
a condom, Jocko, white tea.

1755
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:58,550
There's no dichotomy in the fact
that you can be teaching the, the,

1756
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:00,560
the Jujitsu class at the muster.

1757
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:03,470
And he used the word dichotomy and
then everyone started laughing.

1758
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:08,660
Cause the way he says it is like directly
Tz directly mocking me isn't the word

1759
01:49:08,661 --> 01:49:13,260
dichotomy. Yup. So yeah,
Jack White outstanding,

1760
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:17,840
uh, stuff makes you dead lift 8,000
pounds, but we already knew that. Yeah.

1761
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:22,990
Everyone knows that worldwide dead lift
has increased a lot also it's in cans,

1762
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:29,260
which is good for me because
the whole brewing tea, uh, uh,

1763
01:49:29,390 --> 01:49:33,390
sequence uncomfortable. I'm very
uncomfortable for me. Yes. So you know,

1764
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:36,080
Ken seems more cool, but
whatever, whatever you like.

1765
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:41,200
Also subscribe to this podcast if you
haven't already, uh, on, you know,

1766
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:43,220
wherever you listen to
podcasts. There it is. I know.

1767
01:49:43,221 --> 01:49:45,530
I don't think we even need
to say that anymore. Okay.

1768
01:49:45,531 --> 01:49:46,880
Well I've said that for like a,

1769
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:50,350
or maybe even three years that we don't
need to say to subscribe to the podcast,

1770
01:49:50,351 --> 01:49:54,520
but we do need to say subscribe to the
Warrior Kid podcast. Yes. Check it out.

1771
01:49:55,060 --> 01:49:59,440
Check it out.
Even if you aren't a kid and check it out.

1772
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:05,050
I use a different voice in that podcast.
Dave Burke was talking about it.

1773
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:09,430
He's like, I even like that different.
I use this voice right here.

1774
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:12,280
It's a little bit more aimed at kids.

1775
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:15,130
This is just the way I
normally talk when I do,

1776
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:19,270
cause I'm kind of uncle Jake in that
and he nickel Jake is a little bit more,

1777
01:50:20,020 --> 01:50:22,180
he's not, you will, not Dorky,

1778
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:25,720
but he just doesn't have his little
bit of a dark side. Okay. Yeah.

1779
01:50:26,980 --> 01:50:30,190
Yeah. That's a good way of putting
it. The dark edge. He's just good.

1780
01:50:30,220 --> 01:50:33,190
He's like uncle Jake is just good
across the board. You never know what,

1781
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:34,120
I might have a little,

1782
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:38,440
I might have a little issue with
something and get kind of crazy on it.

1783
01:50:39,390 --> 01:50:40,570
Jake's not going to let that happen.

1784
01:50:40,571 --> 01:50:45,340
So check out the warrior kid podcast if
you want to get some more information to

1785
01:50:45,341 --> 01:50:50,341
your kids about being on the path and
you can hear me talk and tell stories in

1786
01:50:53,141 --> 01:50:56,560
this voice from Uncle Jake.
Yeah.

1787
01:50:57,610 --> 01:51:02,380
Actually sounded exactly like how you
sound on it, which is good. In a way also,

1788
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:06,040
yes, youtube as well, so we do have a
youtube channel. If you didn't know that.

1789
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:10,800
It does have the video version of this
podcast and also little excerpts and

1790
01:51:10,910 --> 01:51:14,680
enhanced excerpts. By the way, I was
noticing some of your recent excerpts.

1791
01:51:14,740 --> 01:51:18,580
You can't make excerpts that are 12
minutes long. That's not an excerpts.

1792
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:20,770
That's just like a video.
Well,

1793
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:26,520
technically that's not correct because
an excerpt is just a part of this with

1794
01:51:27,610 --> 01:51:32,230
the 12 minutes is long, man. I know and
sometimes I'm going to be 12 minutes.

1795
01:51:32,250 --> 01:51:37,060
There is no way that everything in
that 12 minutes is important kind.

1796
01:51:37,061 --> 01:51:40,280
Yeah, that's true. Okay, but then
you pick out your editing scissors.

1797
01:51:40,900 --> 01:51:42,710
Depends on how you look at it though.

1798
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:45,970
These things are supposed to be an expert
should be like, aw, you know what, boom,

1799
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:50,890
two minutes and 28 seconds later you're
like, yeah, I got this. Oh, I dig it.

1800
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:52,200
I agree,
but not a lot of time.

1801
01:51:52,210 --> 01:51:55,830
You want people to pull up
and couch and he even for

1802
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:04,150
some of us are on the computer
doing other stuff and then boom,

1803
01:52:04,151 --> 01:52:06,700
they're, the expert comes
up, you know, about maybe.

1804
01:52:07,070 --> 01:52:10,710
Or maybe it's like you saying something
in me disagreeing and then you saying,

1805
01:52:10,711 --> 01:52:13,180
well this is this. And I'm saying,
well that's true, but what about this?

1806
01:52:13,181 --> 01:52:16,310
And you're like, oh, okay. Or whatever.
You know, it's like a little list.

1807
01:52:16,311 --> 01:52:19,420
So like a little conversation that's
not two hours. See what I'm saying?

1808
01:52:19,770 --> 01:52:23,010
So it's presentable. It's good.
It's due. Okay. So there's,

1809
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:26,770
there's on the youtube channel,
there's the long and short excerpts.

1810
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:31,270
That's a good way that's digestible and
there's a little bit more like, you know,

1811
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:36,610
mealtime conversational, uh, you know,

1812
01:52:36,820 --> 01:52:41,260
cause it's less about like the
shortness and share ability necessarily.

1813
01:52:41,260 --> 01:52:44,230
It's more about like, Hey,
remember this share ability? Oh,

1814
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:48,140
like I can sh watch it come in it.
Yeah.

1815
01:52:48,141 --> 01:52:50,930
They're more likely to watch the
minute video then the 12 minute video.

1816
01:52:50,931 --> 01:52:52,460
But the 12 minutes,

1817
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:57,200
like the kind of like if you just want
to hear about like the specific topic

1818
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,850
that happened to take 12
they're not all 12 minutes.

1819
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:05,060
This may be like eight minutes or so,
maybe six either way.

1820
01:53:05,700 --> 01:53:10,580
Psychological warfare too. Speaking of
little excerpts, those are just short,

1821
01:53:10,820 --> 01:53:11,240
short,

1822
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:16,100
one to two minutes of how to overcome
some type of momentary weakness that you

1823
01:53:16,101 --> 01:53:19,820
might have. If you don't have a discipline
equals freedom tattoo on your wrist,

1824
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:21,950
that's going to keep you in.
Check that.

1825
01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:25,070
This is another thing you can
do prior to getting that tattoo.

1826
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:28,970
You can just load up your
psychological warfare on iTunes,

1827
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:33,140
Google play at MP3 platforms,
whatever, and listen to those. Yes.

1828
01:53:33,230 --> 01:53:38,150
Which is chocolate telling you how
to overcome the weakness. That is,

1829
01:53:38,270 --> 01:53:41,900
that's that tattoo on your wrist is
living equals freedom is like the ultimate

1830
01:53:41,901 --> 01:53:46,130
psychological warfare. It is a weapon.
Your weapon. Boom. Discipline. Oh,

1831
01:53:46,131 --> 01:53:48,740
what if you put discipline on one
wrist and freedom on the other wrist?

1832
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:52,370
I actually might do that. That's pretty
good. That's pretty good. Discipline.

1833
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:56,390
Freedom at origin. Uh,
I've been talking to Pete,

1834
01:53:56,391 --> 01:54:01,391
we're trying to buy a machine that
can make sweat bands wristbands.

1835
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:07,670
Right. And then once we have that
power, two things, number one,

1836
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:11,420
I'm going to make the best wristbands
cause I wear wristbands every time I

1837
01:54:11,430 --> 01:54:16,010
workout. Yeah. And, but there's
no good risk bands in the world.

1838
01:54:16,340 --> 01:54:19,010
There's none of them that meet the
standards that I would like them to meet.

1839
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:22,040
Why do you where we spent
a sweat primarily. Oh,

1840
01:54:22,041 --> 01:54:25,550
so it doesn't go onto to run right
down my arms and my hands and I'm just

1841
01:54:25,551 --> 01:54:29,510
dropping everything and
it sucks. Yeah. So, uh,

1842
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:34,760
I'm going to make wristbands that
are super long really. Right.

1843
01:54:34,970 --> 01:54:36,480
And really like just

1844
01:54:38,450 --> 01:54:41,360
I told Pete and like we can put discipline
a one and freedom on the other one.

1845
01:54:41,540 --> 01:54:45,210
Right. And you can buy little
set. Yeah. So anyways, peach,

1846
01:54:45,260 --> 01:54:49,790
peach shopping for the machine right now.
Good. [inaudible] yes, it can make socks.

1847
01:54:49,791 --> 01:54:54,230
Pete sent me a picture of a machine and
he goes, what do you think this makes?

1848
01:54:55,400 --> 01:54:57,170
And I looked at it and I don't know,

1849
01:54:57,171 --> 01:54:59,920
I just kinda like logically
it was sort of like a um,

1850
01:55:00,590 --> 01:55:05,590
you could see stuff 360 degrees around
something else and I was like I bet you I

1851
01:55:05,901 --> 01:55:10,290
said socks. And he goes day on,
cause I'm not in a good district.

1852
01:55:11,470 --> 01:55:13,760
He was impressed with my logic.

1853
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,130
Deductive skills. It's
good. I'm impressed too.

1854
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,820
Speaking of being impressed,
go to on it. So on it,

1855
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:25,760
the company I'm impressed with
always have been by the way,

1856
01:55:25,790 --> 01:55:28,750
so go to [inaudible] dot com slash

all kinds of cool workout equipment that
you can just slowly add to your arsenal

1859
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:37,820
at home. You've got a home gym,
whatever. Really good stuff on there.

1864
01:55:51,540 --> 01:55:56,430
which is fully in stock. Lily.
Yeah, it w it ran a little low.

1865
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:00,570
We almost didn't make Christmas,
but we made it. Thank God. Cool.

1866
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:05,600
Thanks to everyone on the team that
helped us in all the printers around that,

1867
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:09,900
that printed us copies and we got a
bunch of copies and everyone got them by

1868
01:56:09,901 --> 01:56:11,280
Christmas that I know of.

1869
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:16,340
Everyone that's reached out on Twitter
that said it's not here yet on December

1870
01:56:16,500 --> 01:56:19,950
19th or 13th was like we still don't have
it. I ordered October. I was like, hey,

1871
01:56:19,951 --> 01:56:22,200
it's competent. Please come. And uh,

1872
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:25,100
but as far as I know
everyone got them when they,

1873
01:56:25,610 --> 01:56:29,850
they got them in time for Christmas.
So um,

1874
01:56:29,940 --> 01:56:34,530
now we have a lot. So if you
want to get Mikey in the dragons,

1875
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:39,090
best children's book ever. Ever. Yup.

1876
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:42,400
Yeah, yeah. Disagree with me. No.

1877
01:56:43,020 --> 01:56:47,130
Well I think just by nature I'm like,
well we use made a claim like refute it.

1878
01:56:47,131 --> 01:56:51,150
So I'm all thinking, but because
obviously I want to be like, Hey,

1879
01:56:51,151 --> 01:56:52,350
what about this way of the word kid?

1880
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:57,300
Cause I thought that was what
age group for which, okay,

1881
01:56:57,301 --> 01:56:58,890
best young,
best.

1882
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:02,800
Was it a toddler that reads
Mike and the dragons toddler,

1883
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:07,440
Mike Todd, best toddler.
Someone they can walk.

1884
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:14,040
Well some toddlers can understand invest
children's book picture book with for

1885
01:57:16,171 --> 01:57:19,370
ages five and under
seven and six and under.

1886
01:57:19,470 --> 01:57:23,460
Sure Mike and the dragons there cause
you broke that down water that way the

1887
01:57:23,461 --> 01:57:26,020
warrior kid when the kids get a little
bit older order way of the warrior kid in

1888
01:57:26,021 --> 01:57:28,710
Mark's mission book
three has been written.

1889
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:33,390
I got pictures from John Bozak today via
text. You saw him right? Witnessed. Yes.

1890
01:57:33,391 --> 01:57:36,930
Yeah. How do you like him?
We like him a lot. I showed,

1891
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,820
I showed Danny Reinhardt to my youngest
daughter and I've been, I've been,

1892
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:45,690
I've been telling her about Danny
Reinhardt for a long time cause Danny

1893
01:57:45,690 --> 01:57:48,150
Reinhardt does everything perfect.
And Danny Reinhardt does everything good.

1894
01:57:48,151 --> 01:57:51,990
And Mark's kind of jealous of him
and I shoot and she was, she's been,

1895
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:55,660
she got all into the name Danny Rhyne.
She's annoyed with them.

1896
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:58,450
She's already doesn't like him but the,

1897
01:57:58,451 --> 01:58:02,520
the interesting twist on the story as
Danny Ryan or it's actually a good kid and

1898
01:58:02,521 --> 01:58:06,000
he just happens to be talented and he
happens to work hard and he's actually

1899
01:58:06,001 --> 01:58:09,180
nice but Mark's and jealous.

1900
01:58:09,960 --> 01:58:14,310
So where your kid three coming out in the
spring and right now we've got warrior

1901
01:58:14,311 --> 01:58:15,690
kid one and warrior con two marks.

1902
01:58:15,691 --> 01:58:18,630
Mission all got discipline
equals freedom field manual.

1903
01:58:20,580 --> 01:58:23,940
The manual for getting
after it. Yeah, in life.

1904
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:29,900
Super stoked on everyone that's posting
pictures and I'm actually most stoked

1905
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:35,900
when somebody posts a picture that
they've lost a 162 pounds in 14 months or

1906
01:58:37,621 --> 01:58:41,420
whatever. Completely
changed their lives. Yeah.

1907
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,150
Why discipline equals freedom.

1908
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:46,960
So you can get that book for yourself.

1909
01:58:47,380 --> 01:58:51,370
That's also pre tattoo.
Maybe before you get the tattoo,

1910
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:53,980
you just leave this out on
Europe coffee table. Right.

1911
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:57,610
You just have it there cause it's looking
at you. That book is looking at you.

1912
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:01,900
I've got a stack of them in my room.
I feel they keep me.

1913
01:59:03,430 --> 01:59:07,000
So if you want, if you want the audio
version, it's on iTunes, Amazon music,

1914
01:59:07,001 --> 01:59:10,930
Google play, other MP3 platforms.
Obviously extreme ownership.

1915
01:59:10,931 --> 01:59:13,750
The first book that I wrote
with my brother Leif Babin,

1916
01:59:13,751 --> 01:59:18,751
taking the lessons that we learned on
the battlefield and explaining how they

1917
01:59:19,031 --> 01:59:21,250
can be applied to your
business and to your life.

1918
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:24,700
And that was the followed up that was
followed up by the book that we just had

1919
01:59:24,701 --> 01:59:29,701
come up out called the dichotomy of
leadership and this is getting granular in

1920
01:59:30,671 --> 01:59:35,290
how to apply those leadership
principles into your world. Also,

1921
01:59:35,291 --> 01:59:37,240
we have echelon front,
which is uh,

1922
01:59:37,310 --> 01:59:42,310
my leadership consultancy and what we
do is solve problems through leadership.

1923
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:47,170
If you have any kind of
problem in your organization,

1924
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:51,850
it is a leadership problem.
It is a leadership problem.

1925
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:55,570
We will help get your leadership fixed,

1926
01:59:55,810 --> 02:00:00,730
get them aligned and get them working
and get the team functioning properly.

1927
02:00:01,180 --> 02:00:04,660
We also have a leadership
conference that we do.

1928
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:09,730
It's called the muster in
2019 there are three monsters,

1929
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:11,890
May 23rd and 24th in Chicago,

1930
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:17,100
September 19th and 20th in Denver
and December 4th and fifth in Sydney,

1931
02:00:17,861 --> 02:00:18,790
Australia.

1932
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:24,340
Checkout extreme ownership.com for the
details and to register all of them that

1933
02:00:24,341 --> 02:00:27,970
we've done have sold out. This is,
and what I'm saying, they sold out.

1934
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:32,560
This is when people call me up and say,
or like people that I know say,

1935
02:00:32,561 --> 02:00:36,040
hey, hey, I know what a little late,
just want to, can you just, um,

1936
02:00:36,130 --> 02:00:38,020
can you just reserve three seats from me?
And you know,

1937
02:00:38,021 --> 02:00:42,250
these two other people that I work
with and I'm like, actually no I can't.

1938
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:46,210
You cannot come to, we'll,
we'll just end it back. No,

1939
02:00:46,211 --> 02:00:50,830
there's fire codes that you
can't come. Everyone thinks
you all just, you know, no,

1940
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:56,300
it's sold out. So you
can't come. The, the, um,

1941
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:59,590
the live podcasts we're doing January 9th

1942
02:01:01,450 --> 02:01:06,350
sold out immediately. He was like,
sorry. Gotta be quick on those. Okay.

1943
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:12,040
So there's that, that we do
have this key f online. This is,

1944
02:01:12,070 --> 02:01:15,640
this is the interactive training
leadership training that we put together.

1945
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,810
And okay, so there's several
places where this stem from.

1946
02:01:20,470 --> 02:01:22,360
One of them is the monster itself.

1947
02:01:22,690 --> 02:01:27,130
Cause guess what the muster is
great foundational information.

1948
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:31,540
It's a great foundational leadership,
um,

1949
02:01:31,900 --> 02:01:34,030
instruction that you're
going to get when you go.

1950
02:01:34,180 --> 02:01:35,530
Not everyone can make it to the muster.

1951
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:41,040
So what we did is we took the content
from the first like two monsters that we

1952
02:01:41,631 --> 02:01:44,780
did, and this is the fundamental
principles from extreme ownership,

1953
02:01:44,781 --> 02:01:45,680
from the dichotomy leadership.

1954
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:50,860
We took those and put them
into interactive online
training so that people that

1955
02:01:53,121 --> 02:01:56,570
couldn't make it to the muster
could still get that training.

1956
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:00,650
We also did it because
companies that we work with,

1957
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:04,520
sometimes they have 10,000 employees,
20,000 employees,

1958
02:02:04,521 --> 02:02:08,900
100,000 employees, and all the
employees are not all in one place.

1959
02:02:08,900 --> 02:02:09,860
They're all over the place.

1960
02:02:09,861 --> 02:02:12,950
They're all over the country
and they're all over the world.

1961
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:14,960
How are we going to
train all those people?

1962
02:02:15,240 --> 02:02:19,580
W w what we needed to do was figure out
a way to scale the training that we did.

1963
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:23,780
There were so many requests from the
larger companies we work with to get the

1964
02:02:23,781 --> 02:02:27,290
training to all their employees.
How do we do that?

1965
02:02:27,740 --> 02:02:31,160
We had to scale it so we put it online
and then once we put it on mine for

1966
02:02:31,161 --> 02:02:32,780
companies, we figured, okay,
let's get it out there.

1967
02:02:32,781 --> 02:02:35,930
For direct consumers that
want to take the training,

1968
02:02:35,931 --> 02:02:36,980
they can't come to the monster,

1969
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:39,740
what have you or they want to get
reminded what they learned at the muster.

1970
02:02:39,770 --> 02:02:43,820
Same thing.
So that's online training.

1971
02:02:43,930 --> 02:02:48,930
It's available now@fonline.com
also we've got,

1972
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:50,180
yeah,

1973
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:55,180
Overwatch where we are taking leadership
gaps in the civilian sector and we are

1974
02:02:56,991 --> 02:03:01,991
filling those leadership gaps with
trained and experienced and tested leaders

1975
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:10,780
from combat aviation and from the SPEC
ops community go to e f overwatched.com

1976
02:03:11,630 --> 02:03:13,850
regardless of which side
of that equation you're on,

1977
02:03:13,851 --> 02:03:15,320
whether you're a company
that needs leaders,

1978
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:19,700
whether you're a event that seeking
a leadership position in a company,

1979
02:03:20,450 --> 02:03:20,961
go to Yaffe,

1980
02:03:20,961 --> 02:03:25,961

information that applies to you.

1981
02:03:27,350 --> 02:03:29,360
And if you want to continue
this conversation with us,

1982

we can be found up in the
inner webs on Instagram,

1983
02:03:35,750 --> 02:03:38,660
on Twitter and on the Facebook

1984
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:45,570
you bought echo what's at Echo Charles
and I am at Jocko Willink and finally to

1985
02:03:45,571 --> 02:03:46,980
all our military personnel out there.

1986
02:03:46,981 --> 02:03:51,981
Thank you for protecting freedom around
the world and to our folks in uniform

1987
02:03:52,561 --> 02:03:56,310
here at home. Police and law enforcement
and firefighters, paramedics,

1988
02:03:56,340 --> 02:04:01,170
EMT is correctional officers,
border patrol, all first responders.

1989
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:05,460
Thanks for protecting us and our families.

1990
02:04:06,650 --> 02:04:07,430
Okay.

1991
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:09,050
And to everyone else out there,

1992
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:14,500
remember that discipline
is stronger than fury,

1993
02:04:16,540 --> 02:04:17,370
okay?

1994
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:20,940
You need a little bit of fury.
You need a little bit of discipline.

1995
02:04:20,941 --> 02:04:22,710
You need to combine those things,

1996
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:28,820
but you take that discipline and you
impose discipline upon yourself and reject

1997
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:35,540
and refuse delicate living
and the luxuries that are
available to you in life.

1998
02:04:36,541 --> 02:04:37,374
And

1999
02:04:39,390 --> 02:04:40,223
Yeah,

2000
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:44,190
get out of that comfort and
make yourself better, faster,

2001
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:49,220
smarter and stronger by going
out there day after day after day

2002
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:55,850
and getting after it.
Until next time,

2003
02:04:56,300 --> 02:04:57,980
this is echo and Jocko

2004
02:04:59,820 --> 02:05:00,140
