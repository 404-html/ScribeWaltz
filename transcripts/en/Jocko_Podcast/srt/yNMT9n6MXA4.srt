00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,350
This is Jocko podcast number
one 62 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,230
Jocko Willink.
Good evening.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,630
Good evening on the 22nd of April,

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:18,210
2008 to Marine battalions,

5
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,440
the first battalion,
Ninth Marines,

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,590
the walking dead from Vietnam fame and
the Second Battalion Eighth Marines.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,860
We're switching out pain. Ramadi, Iraq,

8
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,630
one battalion going home in a few
days and the other just starting,

9
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:38,350
it's a seven month tour

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:41,890
to marines,

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,200
Corporal Jonathan Yale and
Lance Corporal Jordan herder,

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,950
22 and 20 years old,
respectively.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,990
One from each battalion.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,780
They were assuming the watch together
at the entrance gate to an outpost that

15
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:02,650
contained a makeshift
barracks housing 50 marines.

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,190
The same broken down,

17
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:11,050
Ram shackled building was
also home to 100 Iraqi police.

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:12,430
Yeah,

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,050
they were my men in this fight
against the terrorists in Ramadi.

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
Yale was a dirt poor mixed race kid from
Virginia with a wife and a daughter and

21
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:32,410
a mother and a sister who lived with
them and he supported them as well.

22
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,320
On $13,000 a year

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,580
herder was a middle class
white kid from long island.

24
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,190
The two of them were from two completely
different worlds in our country.

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,100
Not good,
not bad,

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,353
just different.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,960
Had they not joined the marine corps,
they would never have known each other.

28
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,510
They would never have even understood
that multiple America's exist

29
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,500
simultaneously.
Depending on your education level,

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,810
your family's income status may be,
but they were marines.

31
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,450
They were combat marines and because
of this bond they were brothers.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,140
As close as if they were
born to the same woman,

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,680
the mission orders they received from
the sergeant there, squad leader.

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,900
I am sure when something like this,
okay,

35
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:43,901
you two clowns stand this post and let
know on authorized personnel or vehicles

36
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:46,160
pass you clear on that.

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:53,700
I'm also sure that Yale and hurt her
then rolled their eyes and said in unison

38
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:58,270
something like, yeah, sergeant, we
got it. We know what we're doing.

39
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,020
Well,

40
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:04,160
just enough attitude that made the
point without saying the words.

41
00:03:04,161 --> 00:03:07,500
No kidding sweetheart.
We know what we're doing.

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,920
They then relieved the two other marines
on watch who turns out we're probably

43
00:03:17,211 --> 00:03:19,610
the two luckiest marines on earth that day

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,590
and they assumed their post at the
entry control point at joint security

45
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,890
station. Nasser in the Sophia
district of Ramadi, Iraq,

46
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,370
a few minutes later, a large blue
truck turned down the alleyway.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,630
The alleyway was no more than a hundred
yards in length and spread its way

48
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:49,050
through the serpentine of
Juror Concrete Jersey walls.

49
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,430
The truck stop just short of where
the two were posted and detonated,

50
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,100
killing them both catastrophic Lee,

51
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,520
if you know what combat is like,

52
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,450
you know what I'm talking about
when I say catastrophic Lee,

53
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,950
24 brick masonry houses were
damaged or destroyed by the blast.

54
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,060
A Moscow hundred yards away collapsed.

55
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,950
The truck's engine came
to rest 200 meters away,

56
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,680
knocking most of a building
down before it stopped.

57
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,550
Our EOD guys are explosive.

58
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:39,900
Guys reckoned the blast was made of
at least 2000 pounds of explosives.

59
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,173
Two died.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And because these two young infantry men
didn't have it in their DNA to run from

61
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,230
danger,
150 men,

62
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:56,890
50 us marines and a
hundred Iraqis were saved.

63
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,100
When I read the situation report about
the incident and a few hours after it

64
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:06,461
happened,

65
00:05:06,461 --> 00:05:09,640
I called the regimental commander and
I asked him for details of what had

66
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:13,980
happened.
It seemed different to me.

67
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,070
Unfortunately, marines dying or being
seriously wounded is common in combat.

68
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,980
We expect marines and for that
matter, soldiers, sailors,

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,160
airmen and coast guardsmen regardless
of rank or mos to do their duty,

70
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,210
to stand their ground and
do their duty and to die

71
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,400
if that's what the mission requires.

72
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,510
The regimental commander had just returned
from the site and he agreed with me,

73
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,130
but reported that there were no
American witnesses to the event,

74
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,290
just Iraqi police.

75
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,080
I figured if there was any
chance of finding out what
actually happened and then

76
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:09,620
to recognize and decorate these two young
marines and acknowledged their bravery,

77
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,830
I'd have to do it myself because I
understood that the bureaucrats back in

78
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:19,610
Washington would never accept Iraqi
statements for what had taken place.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,150
If getting these marines properly
awarded had any chance at all,

80
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,010
it had to come under my
signature as a general officer,

81
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,590
so I traveled to Ramadi the next day and
spoke individually to half dozen Iraqi

82
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,740
police,
all of whom told the same story.

83
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,880
They said the blue truck turned down
into the alley and immediately sped up as

84
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:54,300
it made its way through the serpent,
Teen Jersey walls.

85
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,060
They all said they knew
immediately what was going on.

86
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:00,490
Yeah.

87
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,730
Particularly as the marines began to fire.

88
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,390
Okay.

89
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,970
The Iraqi police all began firing as well.

90
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,130
Then to a man,
they ran for safety.

91
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,320
Just prior to the explosion.
They all survived.

92
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,530
Many more injured,
some seriously injured.

93
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,860
One of the Iraqi said to me that they
had all run from the danger like any

94
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,660
normal man would to save his own life.

95
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,810
What he didn't know until then,
what he learned that very day

96
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,110
was that Americans are not normal

97
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,410
with tears welling up. He
said, sir, in the name of God,

98
00:07:56,411 --> 00:07:59,500
no sane man would have stood
there and done what they done.

99
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,430
No sane man.
They saved all of us.

100
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,920
What we didn't know at the time and
what I didn't know at the time and only

101
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:21,700
learned a couple of days later after
I wrote a summary of this bravery and

102
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:26,701
submitted it and submitted them both
Yale and hurt her for the Navy crosses,

103
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,330
which is the number two award for
marines and sailors in combat.

104
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:38,040
What I didn't know was that one of our
security cameras that we had at the

105
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:43,741
location that was damaged initially
in the blast had caught everything.

106
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,360
It had happened exactly as the
Iraqis had described it to me.

107
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,300
Okay.

108
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,980
It took exactly seconds by

109
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,210
that recording from when the truck
entered the alley until it exploded

110
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,180
six seconds

111
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,730
and you can watch,
and I did watch many,

112
00:09:12,731 --> 00:09:17,731
many times on this recording the
last six seconds of their young lives

113
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:23,510
when it first started.

114
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,820
I suppose it took a second or so for the
Marines to separately come to the same

115
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:30,980
conclusion about what was going on.

116
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,470
They had no time to talk it over.

117
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,180
Only enough time to take half an instant
and think about what the sergeant had

118
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,280
told them to do.
Only a few minutes before,

119
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,580
let no unauthorized
personnel or vehicles pass.

120
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,130
At that point in the recording,

121
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,010
the two marines had about
five seconds left to live.

122
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,713
Okay.

123
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,140
It took maybe another two seconds for
the two jar heads to raise their weapons,

124
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,540
take game and open fire on the truck.

125
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,501
By this time,

126
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:12,100
the truck was halfway through the
barriers and gaining speed the whole time.

127
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,970
Hear the recording shows a
number of Iraqi policemen,

128
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,020
some of whom had fired their [inaudible]
now scattering like the normal and

129
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:27,020
rational men. They were some
running right past the marines.

130
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,350
The two marines had about
three seconds left to live

131
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,310
for about two seconds more.

132
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,460
The recording shows the
marines weapons firing nonstop.

133
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,180
The truck's windshield exploded into
shards of glass as their rounds took it

134
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:56,740
apart and undoubtedly tore into the body
of this terrorists that was trying to

135
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,120
kill their brothers.

136
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,403
Yeah.

137
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,630
On aware of the danger at
the time the other marine,

138
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:08,880
since Iraqi soldiers in the barracks
could take comfort in the fact that two

139
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:12,390
marines were on watch and
would die before they ran.

140
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,120
The recording shows the truck careening
to a stop immediately in front of the

141
00:11:21,121 --> 00:11:21,990
two marines

142
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,170
in all of this instantaneous violence.

143
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,960
Yale and herder never hesitated.

144
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,143
Yeah.

145
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,540
They never stepped back.

146
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,880
They never even started to step back.
They never even shifted their weight.

147
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,343
Yeah.

148
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,680
With their feet spread
shoulder width apart.

149
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,130
They leaned into the danger
firing as fast as they could.

150
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,630
They only had one second left to live.

151
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,910
Then the truck explodes,

152
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,840
the camera goes blank.

153
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,710
And the two young men
go to their God,

154
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,750
six seconds,

155
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,410
not enough time to think about
their families, their country,

156
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:37,260
their flag
born about their lives or their deaths,

157
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,800
but more than enough time for two
very brave young men to do their duty

158
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,720
into eternity.

159
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:04,250
That is the kind of people who are
on watch all over the world tonight

160
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,443
for you.

161
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,933
Okay.

162
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
And

163
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,850
that was a speech

164
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,970
that was given by Marine Corps
general,

165
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,750
General Kelly,
and he gave the speech to

166
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,990
gold star families.

167
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,060
These are families who have lost
a service member killed in action,

168
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,260
and he gave that speech on February 21st,
2014

169
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,213
okay.

170
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,460
And General Kelly was obviously
a speaking from the heart.

171
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,970
Not only was he the commanding
general in charge of those marines,

172
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,250
but he also understands loss
on a very personal level

173
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,090
because on November 9th,

174
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,640
2010 general Kelly's oldest son,

175
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,090
First Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly

176
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,280
was killed in action by a landmine while
he was on patrol leading a platoon of

177
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:41,760
marines in Afghanistan.

178
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:54,560
And that story of those two marines is

179
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,150
yet a nother example

180
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,490
of the dedication and the
devotion of the marines.

181
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,750
And we know full well that
there is example after
example after example from all

182
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,670
our branches of service.

183
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,450
Examples
of sacrifice

184
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,610
and do,
you can think about those six seconds,

185
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,320
six seconds.

186
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,670
We throw those away all the time.

187
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,020
We can waste hours and days.
We can even waste weeks

188
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,540
as if we have an endless supply.

189
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,583
Okay,

190
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,173
but we don't.

191
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,500
If you were given six seconds to live,

192
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:24,400
what would fill your mind?

193
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,250
Would you be okay with that?

194
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,200
Would you nod your head and think,
okay,

195
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,463
it's time.

196
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,880
Would you be filled with regret

197
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,580
in those last moments? Would you
think about what you should done it,

198
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,590
which you should have said
who you should have been,

199
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,930
and in
the end

200
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:23,590
would you realize that there's no reason
ever to waste six seconds of your life?

201
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,020
That is one lesson

202
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,930
we can take away from
General Kelly's speech.

203
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,393
Yeah.

204
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,620
Six seconds can be an Aternity.

205
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,670
Another lesson we can take away from
this speech and from its author knowing

206
00:18:02,811 --> 00:18:05,930
that General Kelly had lost his son,
is that we have to move forward.

207
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,030
We have to move on.
And this isn't to say don't feel anything

208
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,610
cause that's wrong.
And that is not what we are doing.

209
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,740
I mean,

210
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,740
who can fathom the pain that General
Kelly felt at the loss of his eldest son

211
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,700
as his eldest son pursued a career that
was no doubt inspired by the general

212
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,534
himself,

213
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,660
but he moved on.
He drove on.

214
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,630
I was talking to a friend of mine

215
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,900
can,
we were talking about survivor's guilt,

216
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,560
which is something that
we all feel on some level

217
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,270
when we're in the military.

218
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,800
And sometimes I think people feel as
if there's something wrong with them.

219
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:23,360
Okay.

220
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,010
Or they feel like they're weak because
they let their emotions get ahold of them

221
00:19:28,011 --> 00:19:28,880
sometimes.

222
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,170
And I could see my friend stealing that

223
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,890
and I told him about an
interview that I did.

224
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,670
Yeah.

225
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,360
With Colonel Tom Fife on this podcast,
the,

226
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:47,320
he was an army officer that
had served in World War II,

227
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,520
Korea and Vietnam. He had gotten
a purple heart in all three wars.

228
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,620
Yeah.

229
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,620
And I explained to my friend that as
Colonel Fife and I were discussing the men

230
00:20:00,611 --> 00:20:02,470
that he lost in Vietnam.

231
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,500
Okay.

232
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,730
Colonel Phife got choked up.

233
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,120
Colonel Phife got choked up.

234
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,520
Yeah.

235
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Despite the fact that 51 years had
passed since he lost those men.

236
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,693
Yeah.

237
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,770
51 years.

238
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,410
Yeah.

239
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,670
But he's still got emotional.

240
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,130
Why is that? It's because we care about
our men because we care about each other.

241
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,250
And it's because while we hear
that time heals all wounds,

242
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:46,830
time does not remove the scars.

243
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,840
They are going to be there
and they're going to hurt.

244
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,040
And that's okay.

245
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,800
And that's normal.

246
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,220
It's normal to feel the pain and
it's normal to feel the guilt.

247
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:07,390
And I think that's one of the hardest
things for vets that I talked to

248
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,380
is that they don't think
that this is normal,

249
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,770
but I am telling you it is normal.

250
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,520
Every vet that I've talked to,

251
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,950
yeah.

252
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,850
From World War Two Vietnam,

253
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,190
the guys that have served in Iraq
and Afghanistan, everyone feels it.

254
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:38,120
It's part of the deal.
It's part of the job.

255
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,590
Yeah.

256
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:45,420
It's part of the aftermath of war.
It's always existed

257
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,020
and if you're feeling that,

258
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,200
then you should know
that you are not alone.

259
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,360
What else did we learn from this speech?

260
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,260
Well,
another thing opens up a whole,

261
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,450
Oh, a whole box. A whole
Pandora's box of lessons learned.

262
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,930
We're talking about urban combat
and how fast things can unfold.

263
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:36,230
Their urban combat is
exceptionally stressful. The,

264
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:41,420
the space time continuum in
urban combat is very compressed.

265
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:46,110
The threats are 360 degrees. The enemy
can be, they can be 500 meters away,

266
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:47,460
but they can also be five meters away

267
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,230
in one of the ways that we can mitigate
that stress and thereby mitigate

268
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,300
casualties and thereby mitigate
the guilt that we all carry.

269
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:02,643
Okay.

270
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Is by knowing and understanding that form
of combat to the best of our ability.

271
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,370
And as always,
history has much to teach us

272
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,560
and I want to go now to a direct source.

273
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,500
The leadership from Charlie one five

274
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,080
Charlie Company,
First Battalion Fifth Marines,

275
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,990
Charlie one five fought in
the battle of waste city,

276
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:43,830
a brutal battle that took place during
the Tet offensive Vietnam 1968 the battle

277
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:49,131
lasted from January 30th to March 4th
and included 11 Arvin battalions for US

278
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,540
Army Battalions, three U S Marine Corps
battalions support from the air force

279
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:02,270
and they were fighting against a
strength of about 10 enemy battalions.

280
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,780
It was a massive battle and way

281
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,600
was a built up city.

282
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,660
It had a population of
almost 150,000 people.

283
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,200
It had typical urban terrain and also
some unique terrain like the citadel,

284
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,840
which was a massive walled
portion of the city.

285
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,200
By the time it was over,

286
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,940
the enemy had lost thousands of
men killed. The South Vietnamese

287
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,560
had lost 452 men in America suffered 216
men killed in action and 1,584 wounded

288
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,824
in action

289
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,340
and here are some quotes
from the interview

290
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,880
from the digital journalists with a
guy by the name of John Olsen and army

291
00:24:55,881 --> 00:25:00,881
combat photographer who is
in way during this battle.

292
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,400
He said,
I was in a way for five days.

293
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,510
I had been in Vietnam for
one year at this time.

294
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,500
I'd seen a lot of battles and I
thought I was pretty experienced,

295
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,990
but I'd never seen anything like way.

296
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,240
Okay.

297
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,930
There was tremendous bravery,
a lot of dead.

298
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,450
There was a situation in way where
we had marines in a courtyard.

299
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,160
They had been moving from house to
house and transitioning here across this

300
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:33,490
courtyard,
they had rocketed.

301
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:39,390
A lot of them were wounded.
There was no radio contact.

302
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,880
We were pinned down and
in pretty bad shape.

303
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,580
We had an element that eventually came
to into leave us and he'd had a priest

304
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,600
and he gave last rites to the dead
and he was a very generous priest.

305
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,080
He offered to give the last rights
to any of us that wanted them dead,

306
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,660
wounded or not scratched at that point

307
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,330
in context, it was such a horrific
battle with such horrific images.

308
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,630
Way was different.

309
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,680
There were tremendous casualties
and no way to treat them,

310
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,480
no way to get them taken out.

311
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,920
There were reports and
as shown in this image,

312
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,690
there was a marine who was badly wounded
so badly he couldn't be treated than he

313
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:29,050
was zipped up in a body bag
while he was still alive.

314
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,760
That's what way was like,

315
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:37,810
okay,

316
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,770
I was in way for five days and we
were under heavy fire all the time.

317
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:48,100
One of my favorite quotes was a journalist
to asking a marine how many times he

318
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:52,330
had been wounded in way
and he said, today, sir.

319
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,073
Yeah,

320
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,630
so it was a brutal battle and there was

321
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:05,973
just

322
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,080
incredible heroism and sacrificed and of
course there were many lessons learned

323
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:18,570
and while the lessons focus on urban
combat and they focus on the battle wastes

324
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,593
city,

325
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,830
I think as you hear some
of these lessons learned,

326
00:27:23,831 --> 00:27:28,150
you'll see they apply broadly
to leadership as a whole.

327
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,580
And as we know, if we understand
the way we can see it in all things.

328
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,680
So let's go to this document.
Lessons learned, Charlie,

329
00:27:38,681 --> 00:27:42,790
one five operation away city 31 January,

330
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:45,070
1968 to five March,
1968

331
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,060
okay.

332
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,710
Even under the best of circumstances,
street fighting is a bloody business.

333
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:56,590
This was in the end,

334
00:27:56,620 --> 00:28:00,190
the ultimate lesson learned by the
United States Marine Corps personnel who

335
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:05,050
participated in this historical battle
considered by many to be the bloodiest of

336
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:05,950
the Vietnam war.

337
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:13,090
The Marine forces involved in operation
way city lost 142 marines killed in

338
00:28:13,431 --> 00:28:15,080
action during the month long battle,

339
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,790
including the initial fierce
clashes involving primarily
fighting throughout the

340
00:28:19,791 --> 00:28:21,170
southern sections of the city.

341
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,940
In the climactic full scale battles
inside the citadel, fortress itself,

342
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,610
hundreds more marines were wounded and
had to be medivaced on both sides of the

343
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:32,390
river.

344
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:36,800
Enemy casualties estimates
range well into the thousands.

345
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,110
Although operation waste city will long
be remembered as an overwhelming victory

346
00:28:43,111 --> 00:28:45,900
over the best conventional forces
the enemy could throw at us.

347
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:50,820
And although the fifth marines overcame
very unfavorable odds and ultimately

348
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:54,690
triumph in the finest traditions
of Marines in combat, in truth,

349
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,420
this battle was a very close thing.

350
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,480
Okay?

351
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,300
At the squad platoon and company levels,

352
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,610
casualty rates were very severe,

353
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,240
as high as 75% or more in some units,

354
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,110
okay?

355
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,490
This was especially true during the
first day of day or two of each unit's

356
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:17,580
initial experience in
full scale urban combat.

357
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,280
There's an important piece right there,

358
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,680
specially heavy casualties during the
first day or two of a unit going into

359
00:29:28,561 --> 00:29:32,970
combat. What does that mean? That means
then that first day and two day or two,

360
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,530
you are learning a ton.

361
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,640
And that also means that if you can find
out and figure out how to simulate that

362
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,820
combat before you enter
into those situations,

363
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:51,060
you'll be able to overcome or at least
mitigate some of those initial shock,

364
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:58,000
uh, things that happen that shock your
system and you're not ready for them.

365
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,980
And you know, I talk about this with,
with doing Jujitsu, for instance,

366
00:30:02,981 --> 00:30:04,240
for females,
right?

367
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:09,780
If you're a female that wants
to learn self defense and you,

368
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,620
you know,
you started training Jujitsu.

369
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:16,700
If you don't train Jujitsu and some
guy grabs a hold of you, you're a,

370
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:19,260
you're in shock. You're not
used to it, you haven't, you,

371
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,160
you have to contend with that.
Something that you're unaccustomed to.

372
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,660
If you train Jujitsu, guess what? You
have guys grabbing you every single day.

373
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,390
They're grabbing you, they're grinding
on you, they're trying to move you.

374
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,140
You're used to that. You don't have to
overcome that. Same thing with combat.

375
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,330
The closer you can get to simulating
what you're going to face in combat,

376
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,640
the better you're going to do in combat.

377
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,330
And you don't have to learn these
horrible lessens your first entry.

378
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,480
And you know, you and I have talked
about this too. If you get, if,

379
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,720
if let's say I learned a new move
in Jujitsu and I did it to you,

380
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,090
you'd,

381
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:00,090
I'd catch you and then I show it to you
and now all of a sudden I can't barely

382
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:02,620
catch you anymore. Right?
That's all it took.

383
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,990
All it takes is you
knowing and understanding.

384
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,020
And it's the same thing when we
talk with businesses and we do,

385
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:11,710
we do roleplaying exercises as a leader.
And how do you talk?

386
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,260
How do you tell someone that they
need to improve their performance?

387
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:17,530
You do a couple of role plays and you
get good at their objections that they're

388
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:19,240
going to give you are the reactions
that they're going to have.

389
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,780
You can get better if you
wait until the real thing.

390
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,540
You're not doing yourself any favors.
Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like an ambush,

391
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,250
right? Like an ambush is so effective,
but if you know that push is coming,

392
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,680
it's not even effective at all. Yeah. And
once you've been ambushed, like imagine,

393
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,250
I mean it, it happens all the
time. Any, anytime you exp,

394
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,050
you know and understand
what's going to happen,

395
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,710
you're infinitely more equipped
to handle that thing. Yeah.

396
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,570
As opposed to I have no idea
what's happening and I'm
going to go and figure it

397
00:31:52,571 --> 00:31:53,760
out on the floor.
Yeah.

398
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,540
So experience is the best,
but guess what?

399
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,960
Experience is expensive.
It takes a lot of time.

400
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,170
So what you have to do is you have
to train. That's what you have to do.

401
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,880
What if the only time you,

402
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,780
what if you wanted to get good at street
fighting and the only time that you got

403
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:13,530
to practice was when he got
in a street fight. Yeah.

404
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,630
Even if you literally went out every
day and got in the street fights,

405
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:18,760
two things would happen. Number one,
you'll get arrested, but number two,

406
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:22,300
you get all the first street fight.
You might pick the wrong person and die.

407
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,670
Yes, that is true, right? Yeah.

408
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,290
So what you want to do is you want to
get into a training environment. Yes.

409
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,290
And then you want to get yourself skilled.
Yeah. Same thing with the military.

410
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,230
Same thing with fighting. Same thing
with shooting. Same thing with business.

411
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,040
Anything that you're,
it's another

412
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,740
thing I see like business people, there's
business people that have been through,

413
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,020
let's say they've been through an
acquisition, an acquisition before.

414
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,820
They know what to expect.

415
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:51,530
They're anticipating what's going on and
it makes them that better at foreseeing

416
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:55,640
what's gonna happen in mitigating
the risk to it. Yeah. How do you,

417
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,930
if you can't go through the acquisition,
well what do you do? Read about him,

418
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,980
you know, interview people, learn
about, figure out what to expect,

419
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,190
but hire someone on your team that has
been through an acquisition before so you

420
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:09,830
get, can capitalize on
their experience. Yeah,

421
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,040
it's crazy. I guess when you think about
it. Not Crazy, but it's interesting.

422
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,750
So you know like sports teams for example,
like a, um, well, uh, I guess football,

423
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:25,280
say football for an example.
You practice for like five or six days,

424
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,530
just practice, practice, practice and two,
sometimes more hours every single day,

425
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,700
you know, maybe a day off maybe.
And then, yeah, for one game.

426
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,470
So it's like there's training,

427
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:39,470
then there's performance kind of thing
and they go kind of hand in hand.

428
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:41,750
Like you got to perform in
training and then you know,

429
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,370
the game or whatever that you learned
stuffed in. They get them too. But it's,

430
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:51,730
it's interesting where one game
is predicated on so much training,

431
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,130
so much training, but then when
you go to work, it's like you,

432
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,280
you kind of expect to have gone or they
expect you or whatever the expectation

433
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,530
is that you went through
your training or Eddie,

434
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,220
and then they'll add sprinkles
of training. Like a work.

435
00:34:07,221 --> 00:34:09,240
Just normal when you go to work.
Yeah.

436
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,630
So every once in a while you'll have
what gear. Quite honestly, that's,

437
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:17,930
that's one of the reasons I salon Ashlyn
font is doing well because people are

438
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,480
realizing that if you want your
leaders to know how to lead,

439
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:24,050
you actually have to train them out of
lead and that you can actually do that.

440
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,950
Yeah.

441
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,950
So that's one of the reasons that it's
you Ashkelon front is in such high demand

442
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,303
because

443
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,760
we can actually train your leaders to
handle these situations that they're

444
00:34:37,761 --> 00:34:41,300
coming up against. And when you do
that, you have this massive advantage.

445
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:44,840
And we see the companies that
we work with, they, they, their,

446
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:49,841
their performance just improves immensely
because their leaders are working

447
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:54,230
together and learning how to lead. And the
most powerful thing you can have. Yeah,

448
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,880
it's, it's weird cause I, you know,

449
00:34:55,881 --> 00:34:59,700
I'm kind of behind the scenes guy with
echelon front and I see like, you know,

450
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,990
any video that it's been done, I probably
seen it, you know, and I'm around,

451
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,760
you know, all the time. So essentially
I'm getting the course too, you know?

452
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:13,870
And it's interesting where
I think probably in a lot
of cases I probably am more

453
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:17,450
trained in it than most people.
Even most people,

454
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,270
companies that you work with or
whatever because I'm kind of getting it

455
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:23,420
secondhand and listening because it
applies to everyday life, you know,

456
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,200
like this whole deal.
It's not just work isn't in fact for me,

457
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:29,390
I mean yeah it applies
to my quote unquote work.

458
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,460
But it applies to like family
stuff, you know, life stuff.

459
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,430
And the big thing, this is the big
thing. This is a big difference. You

460
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,690
know the material,
you but you because your position,

461
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,230
you'd use it on your family but you
don't use it in a work environment.

462
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,250
And therefore you get to learn the
technique but you don't get to roll.

463
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:53,430
You don't get to spar. Not In
hard. And here's the thing,

464
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,880
when we work with companies, it's not
like, oh, here's this information,

465
00:35:56,881 --> 00:36:00,330
and then they go apply it perfectly.
No, they come back and say, hey,

466
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:03,810
this didn't work. I went and talked to guy
and he said this, it's like, okay, cool.

467
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,020
Here's how you've got to overcome that.
So there's the,

468
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:11,380
you got to get the initial information.
Yes, but you still have to apply it.

469
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,780
Even if you train a group for
combat as much as you possibly can,

470
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,940
they're still going to have a certain
delta that they're going to need to rise

471
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:24,780
to when the real free occurs.
And so we see that with companies.

472
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,960
We see that with individual leaders
that are part of companies where they're

473
00:36:30,151 --> 00:36:32,360
there and I show up sometimes,
you know,

474
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:36,030
there's some people out there that are
just straight up in the game and they're

475
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:40,530
in the game before I even show up.
Like it's the icing on the cake.

476
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,130
And even people that have read
extreme ownership 10 times,

477
00:36:44,131 --> 00:36:46,620
they've read dichotomy
of leadership 12 times.

478
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:51,420
They've listened to every single podcast
and they'll still ask questions about

479
00:36:51,421 --> 00:36:55,200
things because they haven't
quite put it together,

480
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,860
split like they haven't mapped it
perfectly on their situation. Right.

481
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:02,310
And just like I said, like it takes,
it takes like, okay, how you say,

482
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,090
I don't really get to spar. I D I do
get to spar, but they're real easy,

483
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:10,170
super easy sparring partners. What do I
got? I got you. I got my wife, you know,

484
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:14,250
I'm like, you know, this is coming easy.
Splunk partner technically. Yeah, for the,

485
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,084
for this stuff it is.

486
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,330
I mean technically you're the easiest
sparring partner because you're just like,

487
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:22,050
you're doing the same thing, you know?
So it's like there's no friction. I mean,

488
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:26,870
very little friction maybe on some level,
but I miss songs.

489
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,050
But the, the, you know, these people at
work when they apply it, well you know,

490
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,180
when you have, whether it be a
corporate job or what or whatever,

491
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,230
anytime where you have bigger teams,
different personalities, you know,

492
00:37:40,231 --> 00:37:43,620
you care about people in different levels.
It's like it takes way more,

493
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:48,650
it takes more effort and more time on
the mat for people to get proficient to

494
00:37:49,831 --> 00:37:52,560
where you look at a situation, you go,
oh, here's what this, here's the problem,

495
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,690
going to hear this guys. He goes, get a
little out of control a minute, massages,

496
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,470
ego a little bit,

497
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:58,200
and we'll let them have some more control
and that'll make him feel better and

498
00:37:58,201 --> 00:37:59,330
they'll do a better job like it.

499
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,290
It takes a little bit of experience to
get to that point. And, and you know,

500
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,760
a lot of times,
like I said,

501
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:09,600
when we go and work with a company that
this fully in the game and they'll be

502
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:10,081
batting,

503
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:13,440
there'll be nailing nine out of 10 things
and then there'll be one more thing

504
00:38:13,441 --> 00:38:14,730
that they need a little adjustment on.

505
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,500
And they make that adjustment
and they call. Yeah. You know,

506
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:19,740
and everything makes sense.

507
00:38:19,741 --> 00:38:23,820
So training is how you get good.

508
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:28,850
Don't waste your time getting beat up
in street fights in order to learn.

509
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,500
It doesn't make sense.
All right. Moving on.

510
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,150
The ultimate success of this operation
could have been significantly improved in

511
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,920
our opinion by several factors,

512
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:46,950
including one improved less
restrictive rules of engagement,

513
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,990
including situational flexibility
down to the platoon level.

514
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:54,250
This is something we hear about all
the time. Here's the deal. What that,

515
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:58,270
what that really means
is decentralized command.

516
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,740
You need to trust your troops. You need
to explain to them what is important,

517
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:07,360
what is not rules of engagement to
tell someone you cannot do this.

518
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,850
What I'm saying,
if I say Echo,

519
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,140
you cannot shoot at this type of building.

520
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,090
If I tell you that what I'm telling
you is I don't trust you to make a good

521
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,910
decision based on the information I
give you. If I was to say, Hey, listen,

522
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,970
some of these buildings
that are marked with a star,

523
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,450
those buildings are historical buildings
that will cause the civilian populace

524
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,900
to um, you know, get angry at
us. So don't shoot at them.

525
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:39,550
If I say that to you and I say, tell
me, explain to you why it's important,

526
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,650
and then I say, hey, look, then
again, remember you're in the field.

527
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,570
You need to protect your men and you say
God and now you go on the field and if

528
00:39:49,571 --> 00:39:52,450
you're a good leader and you trust me
and I trust you and I've explained the

529
00:39:52,451 --> 00:39:55,450
commander's intent well and you
understand the strategic impact of,

530
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,620
of disobeying or of, of going
outside the rules of him that that,

531
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,600
or not the rules,
but the direction that I've given you,

532
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,340
then you understand that that's great
and you'll make a good decision because

533
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:09,610
what that decision might entail is
you're getting shot at from one of these

534
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:11,770
buildings and now you
have to take it down.

535
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,980
If I don't trust you to make
that decision, what do I do?

536
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:20,010
I put strict rules of engagement on you
and now you can't do something and that

537
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:26,020
is, that is not decentralized
command and it's not generally good.

538
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,290
Do you have to put some broad rules
in place? Yes, you absolutely do,

539
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,040
but you have to make sure that the people
on the ground understand that those

540
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,370
rules can be bent if they have to,

541
00:40:34,371 --> 00:40:36,370
when they have to have the
authority and the leeway to do that

542
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,420
next to improved communication.

543
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:44,260
Of intelligence information to all levels
of command. Of course, communicate.

544
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,110
Communication is one of those
things. And again, I, I feel,

545
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,480
I always feel when we go
to work with a company,

546
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,690
it's one of the first things I have to
ask is what are your methodologies of

547
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:54,400
communication through your company?

548
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:56,530
How do you communicate
with your frontline troops?

549
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,480
How do you communicate with
your mid level managers?

550
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,260
How do your mid level managers and your
frontline troops communicate with you?

551
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,770
Because sometimes the front line
troops might see something out on the

552
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:09,360
battlefield, but you don't see because
you're up in the ivory tower. Yeah.

553
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,510
And how do they communicate that back
to you? Do you have a methodology?

554
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,610
Oftentimes communication
is ineffective or it's,

555
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,030
they don't have procedures around it.

556
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,510
They have protocol on how
to communicate that's bad.

557
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,250
So communication up and down
the chain of command. Simple,

558
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,260
clear and concise.
And that's the way it's gotta be.

559
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,110
Three acquisition of improved intelligent
data in particular concerning the

560
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:37,160
disposition and size of enemy forces.
That's cool.

561
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:39,220
That's a little bit of,
uh,

562
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:44,590
a universal fantasy for military
people that we want great intelligence.

563
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,750
We want to know who the enemy is.
If we knew who the enemy has power jobs,

564
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,230
so that's a,

565
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:55,040
that's a universal fantasy and we should
always strive to achieve that fantasy,

566
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:56,180
but it's very difficult to get to.

567
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:59,570
But then they go to this reconnaissance
and small unit probes to fix enemy

568
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:03,770
positions are critical. What? What that
means is when you want intelligence,

569
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,330
go get it.
Go find it.

570
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,290
Gather the Intel yourself as much as you
can for improved supporting fire plan,

571
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,720
access to artillery,
naval gunfire,

572
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:19,100
direct fire from armored vehicles and air
support should be judiciously employed.

573
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,120
Doh deployed. So what does
that mean? We need to cover?

574
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,140
We need cover from big guns covering move
five significantly increased training

575
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:33,020
for urban conflict,
street fighting practice and preparation.

576
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,090
I think we just covered that.
Training is always paramount.

577
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,960
Six deployment of available
chemical weapons in this case,

578
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:46,610
tear gas for offensive operations
during early stages of the operation.

579
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,270
These guys use tear
gas and it worked well.

580
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,920
The North Vietnamese army had didn't
have gas masks and they didn't like it.

581
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,390
Of course, you know, there's people
when you, when you say chemical weapons,

582
00:43:05,391 --> 00:43:08,420
what do we think of? We think
a mustard gas. There's other,

583
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,340
there's nerve agents and nerve gas.

584
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:13,100
That's where people generally think
of when you think of chemical weapons,

585
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:18,490
but chemical weapons are also tear gas
and tear gas can be very effective.

586
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,510
There's also some people that can
just BTF through threw tear gas. Yeah.

587
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,233
Uh,

588
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:31,250
continuing seven,

589
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,730
improved dissemination of operational
plan details down to the fire team level.

590
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,220
Fire team leaders,
these fire team leaders.

591
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,890
If the fire team leaders,

592
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,300
and you're talking about someone that's
in charge of four guys or six guys or

593
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:51,100
something like that.
Really small little element.

594
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,360
If those people understand what
you're trying to accomplish as a team,

595
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,080
that means they can execute at
their level and make things happen.

596
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,050
They can move the ball
in the right direction.

597
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,620
If they don't know where they're supposed
to be going. They can't help you. Yeah,

598
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:12,010
they can help you.
So broad guidance needs to be given,

599
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,580
needs to be updated. People
need to understand, hey,

600
00:44:15,581 --> 00:44:17,770
we're trying to move forward
trying to take this area.

601
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,740
We're trying to move across this line.

602
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,820
Everyone needs to understand that if
they don't understand that they're there.

603
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,190
Actually no good to you.

604
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,770
If you've got a fire team leader out
on the flank somewhere that has no idea

605
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,250
that you're trying to move forward
or move east or west or north,

606
00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:38,580
that person is just sitting there
waiting for you to tell him what to do.

607
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,790
They're almost worthless. So, and,

608
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,820
and this also means if you're a fire
team leader and you don't know if you're

609
00:44:44,821 --> 00:44:46,800
supposed to be going north,
east, south, west, whatever,

610
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,470
you should be raising your hand
and saying, Hey, what are we doing?

611
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:50,790
Tell me what we're doing.

612
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,350
Continuing on the other side of the scale,
small unit experience,

613
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:01,010
individual marine determination,
the buddy system,

614
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:04,880
the quick learning capacity of
marines under combat conditions,

615
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:10,090
the combined leadership officer's staff
Nco as an NCO pose of one five at all

616
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:11,091
levels.

617
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:14,720
And the ultimate ability to coordinate
fire support and execute street fighting

618
00:45:14,721 --> 00:45:17,390
tactics under heavy fire
were factors that one,

619
00:45:17,391 --> 00:45:20,060
this pivotal battle
despite incredible odds,

620
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:24,870
high casualty rates and the resulting
turnover of officers and NC.

621
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,270
So you, it comes down to your
individual marines and your,

622
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:35,080
your frontline leadership
that make these things happen,

623
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:41,250
which no doubt the military or
the u s military is awesome in a,

624
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:44,470
in their front line leadership
and the frontline troops,

625
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,580
they make so many things
happen. The, even in many cases,

626
00:45:48,581 --> 00:45:52,960
despite poor leadership, you just, you
just have great frontline leadership.

627
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,790
I mean I would see that a lot.
You know,

628
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:59,020
you'd get a platoon that had kind of
a marginal and if not maybe even a bad

629
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,770
platoon commander, but you just get some
guys in that platoon that are awesome.

630
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,750
The platoon would be awesome as long
as the leader was humble enough to take

631
00:46:07,751 --> 00:46:10,240
guidance. If the, if the leader
wasn't humble enough to take guidance,

632
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:15,040
they would fail because he would just
drag everyone in his terrible ways down.

633
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,490
If he, if he had the common
sense to say, you know what,

634
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:20,920
I'm going to listen to these guys.
I'm going to let them kind of run with it.

635
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:25,630
Platoon would do fine.
Continuing on,

636
00:46:25,631 --> 00:46:28,150
certainly using 20,
20 perspective of hindsight,

637
00:46:28,151 --> 00:46:31,750
this battle could have been decided and
even more timely and decisive fashion,

638
00:46:31,751 --> 00:46:35,470
reducing friendly casualty rates in
the process by paying attention to the

639
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:37,330
fundamentals of Planning
Marine Operations.

640
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:42,610
Proper prior planning prevents Piss poor
performance and they actually edited

641
00:46:42,611 --> 00:46:46,390
out pis because they're squared away.
Marines.

642
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,470
Yeah, got to come up with a good
plan and had they done that better?

643
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,210
This is the typical situation.
Hindsight's always 2020 and I,

644
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,300
I always avoid becoming a arm chair
postgame critic in the military.

645
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,240
I mean I'll criticize someone like
a fighter in the UFC or whatever,

646
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:17,320
but when it comes to military operations,
uh,

647
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,630
it's real easy to sit back and
throw darts and say, well, you know,

648
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:27,070
I would have done this. You weren't
there. You didn't see it. I didn't see it.

649
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,850
I wasn't in this situation. I have all
the now they didn't have those facts.

650
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:35,851
So I'm always very cautious
about Huc and darts into the past

651
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:41,050
and you deal with like that can situation
you. It's, and you kind of use it.

652
00:47:41,051 --> 00:47:42,760
You actually do you use this as,

653
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:47,110
you know when you say you can sit back
and be at a tactical genius or whatever?

654
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,330
Yeah.
I don't know.

655
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,480
If I make a video you can like sit
back and be like look at these like 10

656
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,490
mistakes or 10 things or whatever.

657
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,790
Meanwhile there's like a thousand
elements so 990 elements have had to be

658
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:04,690
created well in in work and all this
stuff and then you can just be like,

659
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,360
yeah those, cause essentially those
are created for you. You know,

660
00:48:07,361 --> 00:48:08,680
you don't have to create those things.

661
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:12,370
All you have to do is poke holes in
the 10 yeah and I can focus instead of

662
00:48:12,371 --> 00:48:13,870
having to focus on a thousand things,

663
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:18,370
I can take a broader look and see the 10
things that you screwed up or one thing.

664
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,640
None of nine Mikey slick.
Probably this one

665
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,890
maybe too.
All right.

666
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,270
The following details regarding the
lessons learned from operation wasted.

667
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:30,370
You're offered from the former
members of Charlie company,

668
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:31,870
First Battalion Fifth Marine Regiment,

669
00:48:31,871 --> 00:48:35,710
First Marine Division who served in
combat during operation way city and who

670
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:39,310
were directly involved in the battle with
Nva forces inside the citadel fortress

671
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:43,330
from 13 February, February,
1968 through five March,

672
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:45,010
1968 situation terrain.

673
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,620
There is an infinite variety of possible
landscapes that may be confronted by a

674
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:54,670
Marine force given the mission of
attacking an enemy force in urban terrain,

675
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:02,170
infinite variety of possible landscapes.
What does that remind me of?

676
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,330
That reminds me of life itself.

677
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:10,690
When the Tet offensive
broke out on 31 January,

678
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,620
1968 and conventional NVA forces overran
major sections of the largest cities in

679
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:15,490
south Vietnam.

680
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,050
Marine forces were literally knee
deep and Rice patties in jungle mud.

681
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,820
Since first establishing a beachhead
in 1965 marines had been assigned the

682
00:49:24,821 --> 00:49:28,450
mission of conducting a
counterinsurgency or rural conflict,

683
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,750
fighting for the most part,
a guerilla army.

684
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:34,630
The Tet offensive changed all of that.

685
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,810
And for the first time since the height
of the Korean War in 1954 marines found

686
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,930
themselves with a mission
that involved urban combat.

687
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:46,020
Okay.

688
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,530
So you have to be able to,

689
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:53,470
you should never turn your back
on something. I had a fighter,

690
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,280
I was training for a fight and

691
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:57,900
okay.

692
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,290
I was like, Hey, let's
do some groundwork. No,

693
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:05,880
the with you on the bottom. And
the dude was strong. He wasn't a,

694
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,110
it wasn't a good wrestler. Well let
me rephrase that. A decent wrestler,

695
00:50:10,111 --> 00:50:12,500
but not by any stretch,
you know, not a call that,

696
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,530
not a competitive call address or
anything like that, but solid, strong,

697
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:20,220
very strong. I said, hey man,
let's put you on the bottom.

698
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,450
And the response was,
I'm not going to be on the bottom.

699
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,290
Yeah.

700
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,123
Gotcha.

701
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,310
Hey, well even if you don't think
you're going to be on the bottom,

702
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:35,630
let's train for the unlikely event
that you happen to end up on the bottom

703
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:38,900
because it's a fight and anything
happened. I don't need to,

704
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:43,160
I'm not going to be on the bottom. Yeah.
So we can sell where the story's going.

705
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,450
He went to his fight and fought and was
on the bottom. Basically the whole fight,

706
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,430
it was a three round fight,
was on the bottom almost the whole time.

707
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,290
So it was oral via and why?
Because you can't,

708
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:58,730
you can't neglect one.
Part of the possibilities that can unfold.

709
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:04,130
And even even for us,
when we would get ready to deploy to Iraq,

710
00:51:04,131 --> 00:51:05,120
we're going to Iraq.

711
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,620
We're literally going to a desert and
going to be in the middle of the desert

712
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,200
and we would still do dive operations.

713
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:16,850
We'd still do maritime operations while
we were getting ready to deploy. Why?

714
00:51:16,851 --> 00:51:17,810
Because we don't know what's gonna Happen.

715
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,570
We don't know whether it would
next war is going to break out.

716
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:24,950
So just don't neglect anything.

717
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:30,920
And I'll tell you what else.
If you're good at a variety of things,

718
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:36,380
you will be better at everything. So if
all we knew how to do is enter rooms,

719
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:39,860
what happens when, when that, when we,

720
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,350
when we enter a building and
instead of being a bunch of rooms,

721
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:44,330
it's a giant warehouse or no,
it needs to be cleared.

722
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,900
Like we've gotta think about these things.
But the more flexible you are,

723
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,300
the more capabilities you have
that that's what I'm looking for.

724
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,420
The more capabilities you have,
the more flexibility you have.

725
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:58,550
So learn different skill sets.
Don't neglect things.

726
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:06,300
Continuing on preparing to remove an enemy
battalion that is captured a 40 story

727
00:52:06,301 --> 00:52:09,330
skyscraper or a college campus
as much different than, oh,

728
00:52:09,331 --> 00:52:12,780
he's a much different mission than
getting the enemy squad out of a house,

729
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:17,010
school or church in a small town. But
common factor in all of these variations,

730
00:52:17,011 --> 00:52:21,990
however, is that in all cases in urban
combat structures dominate the terrain.

731
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:27,780
Studying and assessing
terrain is a fundamental issue
for marine commanders when

732
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:29,310
planning mission,
this,

733
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:33,510
this idea of terrain is so important.

734
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:39,480
The way,
the advantage that terrain gives you is,

735
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:44,250
I don't know what to compare it
to in other, in anything else.

736
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,710
If you understand terrain,

737
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:48,690
okay,

738
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:49,480
you can dominate.

739
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,150
It's like trying to do Jujitsu and not
understanding arm position like where

740
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:55,680
that you need under hooks.
If you know,

741
00:52:55,681 --> 00:52:57,660
if you're going against people
don't understand on our hooks,

742
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,650
you will destroy them.

743
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,690
If you go in against someone that doesn't
understand where to position their

744
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:06,450
hands, where to position their
arms, you will destroy them.

745
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,970
If you're going to get someone that
doesn't understand how to utilize the

746
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:11,010
terrain, you will, you will destroy them.

747
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,940
If you don't know how to utilize
the terrain, you will get destroyed.

748
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,340
And by the way, that doesn't matter
if you're in the city, you're in,

749
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,140
in rural environment as
a matter where you are.

750
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,400
Studying and terrain is a fundamental

751
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,290
issue for marine commanders
when planning missions.

752
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:31,470
This is even more critical and planning
house to house combat operations,

753
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,540
building materials very worldwide and
their ability to provide small arms cover

754
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:39,780
to a very high degree for the use
of reconnaissance and intelligence.

755
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:43,590
We recommend conducting a
serious assessment of each
building or structure that

756
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:48,060
is within your units area of operations
because tactics involved and taking each

757
00:53:48,061 --> 00:53:52,950
objective, building structure, et
Cetera, maybe different. In each case,

758
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,600
a small wood frame house may offer to the
illusion of cover from small arms fire,

759
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:01,200
but little else in some places,
walls are paper thin.

760
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,640
Even houses that use some form of plaster
concrete construction can prove to be

761
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:09,360
unexpectedly porous and at
the worst possible times.

762
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,380
This is something to
consider all the time.

763
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,490
Things are not always what they see that
that's, that's what's important there.

764
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,390
Things are not always what they seem you,

765
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:25,700
you think you're hiding behind
a wall and now you're safe.

766
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,410
No bullets will go right through it.

767
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,463
Yeah.

768
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:34,110
Continuing. No. The basic
layout of a structure as much
as possible before entry.

769
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,330
This is something that I would say our
standard operating procedures in the u s

770
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:43,890
military now are so good that we don't
really need to know that did the layout

771
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,960
of a structure.
Hmm,

772
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:50,390
we're gonna go in and be able to
handle whatever the structure,

773
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,650
however the structure is laid out.
That's what we do.

774
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,000
If you don't train to enter rooms
regularly and you don't train to enter

775
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:03,780
buildings and you don't train to be able
to contend with all these varieties of

776
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:07,260
things that you could face, you won't
be able to, if you try and say, okay,

777
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:10,280
we need to know what the building looks
like inside before we go in there.

778
00:55:10,290 --> 00:55:13,800
That's a horrible, horrible idea. It's
not going to happen. And by the way,

779
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:14,910
when you go in there,

780
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,520
the first thing you're going to come
across as a barricade where you can't go

781
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,650
down the hallway and you got to go
through these other rooms that you weren't

782
00:55:19,651 --> 00:55:20,310
expecting.

783
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:21,143
Hmm.

784
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,610
Continuing approach,

785
00:55:24,611 --> 00:55:29,110
each structure with an entry plan and a
surge plan and make sure each member of

786
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:33,040
the fire team in squad as well versed in
these plans. What I say instead of that,

787
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:35,170
it's not plans.
These are standard operating procedures.

788
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:38,110
So you develop standard operating
procedures so you know what to do when you

789
00:55:38,111 --> 00:55:40,120
enter a building.
And so does everyone on the team

790
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,730
established voice codes and commands and
communicate regularly with each other?

791
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,593
Yes.

792
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:50,950
Consider entryways existing doors and
windows to be extremely dangerous,

793
00:55:50,951 --> 00:55:54,340
likely locations for Woobie traps
and to be avoided if at all possible,

794
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:58,030
wherever possible, blow entry holes
using Satchel charges are rockets.

795
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,520
Once the entry plan is
finalized and understood,

796
00:56:00,521 --> 00:56:03,190
it must be executed with
fierce determination.

797
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,600
Be prepared for anything
and be ready to improvise.

798
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:13,540
Be Systematic and check everything.
Basement, sewer access addicts, rooftops,

799
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:16,630
trash cans thoroughly before establishing
that the objective is secure.

800
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:20,680
So what I, one of the most important
things I take away from that is that the,

801
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:25,300
the existing entryways,
you got to consider them dangerous.

802
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,480
W W how do we translate that into life?

803
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:33,570
What that means is these well
established patterns are exactly that.

804
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,310
And it, I'm not saying you can't ever
use a pattern that someone else used,

805
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,380
but you at least at a minimum,

806
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:44,740
have to be aware of the fact
that when you're doing something,

807
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,760
when you're using a path that
someone else has already gone down,

808
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:50,380
it's a known path.

809
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,580
And so you can't expect to be able to
surprise your competitor when you're doing

810
00:56:57,401 --> 00:56:59,870
something that's always been
done the same way. Gotcha. Yeah.

811
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:04,750
So think of how you can approach things
in a different manner and if in fact

812
00:57:04,751 --> 00:57:05,680
that manner might be better.

813
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,560
Sometimes you look at things
from a different angle and you,

814
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,830
you realize that the reason that everyone
does it this way is because that's the

815
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:15,100
best possible way and to make some huge,

816
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,640
Herculean effort to try and do
something like, to just to be different.

817
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,320
Sometimes that's the wrong answer.
I get that. But considerate. Yeah.

818
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:25,980
Yeah.
Lot of times those,

819
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:30,480
and like certain industries are like
this up in an email, but they're,

820
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,140
they're so used to doing it a certain
way because that's sort of like what they

821
00:57:34,141 --> 00:57:37,530
learned then. It's all for sure.
It's almost like as an industry,

822
00:57:37,531 --> 00:57:41,370
they don't think of like what,
why they're doing it that way.

823
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,340
Well, yeah, that's why,

824
00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:46,960
that's why there's been so many
disruptors right in the last few years.

825
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,810
I mean, you can look at any
of these disruptors, uh,

826
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,680
companies that are come out
of nowhere that, you know,

827
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:56,590
you can look at the ride
sharing applications.

828
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,160
If you were a taxi driver,
you were thinking, okay,

829
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:04,300
how can we get more dispatchers? How
can I hire more cars? These, you know,

830
00:58:04,301 --> 00:58:07,990
these ride sharing people said, oh,
we're not going to own any cars. Yeah,

831
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,730
that's great. Same with Airbnb, right?

832
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,380
We're not going to build a hotel.

833
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:17,740
We're going to use a random people's
houses and puts you in there.

834
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,550
That's looking at it from a
completely different angle. Yeah.

835
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:24,580
Seeing a problem and coming up with
a completely different solution.

836
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:28,600
If you looked at a city and said, oh
wow, there's no rooms in that city.

837
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,540
There's no hotel rooms in that city. Where
am I going to put in? Everyone? Okay,

838
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,040
well let's do what everyone else does.

839
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:38,110
We'll build a building and we'll put rooms
in there and we'll staff the building

840
00:58:38,111 --> 00:58:41,470
and we'll put a restaurant. That's
what you do. That's what's been done.

841
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,090
Guess what? Someone else looked
at that and said, you know,

842
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,560
there's nowhere to stay in that city,

843
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:52,060
but some people might have empty
rooms in their house. Let's,

844
00:58:52,061 --> 00:58:54,670
let's see if we can access
those rooms. Boom. There you go.

845
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,270
Yeah. I wonder how it was where the guy,
one of the guys was like, hey shoot,

846
00:58:59,271 --> 00:59:02,330
I can't find a hotel room
when I go to San Francisco.

847
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,420
And then the friend was like,
Hey, just come stay with me. Yup.

848
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:08,210
And then when he stayed with them, he
was like, you know, next time you come,

849
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,450
if you, if he can't find a hotel room,
you can always stay with me when I call.

850
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,630
Yeah. Hey, I'm not the only way I'm
coming up here. I'm coming up on and

851
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,110
you know, um, my company's paying me to
come up here so I can get them, you know,

852
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:22,000
they'll give me money for the room,
so maybe I could just pay you and

853
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:24,450
you go, oh cool. We're kind of,
we're kind of getting a little,

854
00:59:24,490 --> 00:59:28,490
it helps us kick it back to the company.
Cool. And then the next thing you know,

855
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:33,110
hey, I bet other cities have, I know
a guy down the road, he has a room,

856
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:35,910
it doesn't really use.
So if you have any coworkers and Ellen,

857
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,140
if you know anybody, you know that
guy too. Simple as that. Yeah.

858
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,480
Simple as that. But it's looking
at it from a different angle.

859
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:46,970
Yeah.

860
00:59:46,970 --> 00:59:50,750
So look at things from a different
angle then what you come up, you know,

861
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:55,380
fierce determination first determination
is always good. Yeah, that makes sense.

862
00:59:55,381 --> 00:59:57,680
Is there a dichotomy to fierce
determination? Yes. The redness.

863
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:01,790
Can you have someone that's too fiercely
determined? Fiercely determined,

864
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:04,460
yes you can. Yes, you can.

865
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,610
They don't know when to stop.
Yeah.

866
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,313
Next.

867
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,390
The other aspect of urban terrain or
the spaces between buildings, streets,

868
01:00:16,391 --> 01:00:20,590
alleys and other pathways are normal
routes for humans and therefore must be

869
01:00:20,591 --> 01:00:21,640
sussed.
Must be,

870
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,120
must be suspected to be under observation
and possible enemy firing lanes

871
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:31,630
whenever possible. Take the most
difficult route from house to house. Hmm.

872
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,540
Same thing we just talked about.
Look for a different path.

873
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:36,970
Establish and the,

874
01:00:36,971 --> 01:00:41,740
and there's obviously there's a dichotomy
to that because if you're constantly

875
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:44,920
just taking the hard road all the time,
you might not make any progress,

876
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,580
which is also bad.
Established an advance,

877
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:52,320
a plan of what to do in
the event noncombatants are
found in urban zones and for

878
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:53,710
marking buildings that had been cleared.

879
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,760
It's kind of crazy that they knew would
have an idea of how they're going to

880
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:01,470
mark buildings that were cleared.
Continuing.

881
01:01:01,471 --> 01:01:05,700
Make absolutely sure that your marines
are aware that while inside a building

882
01:01:05,701 --> 01:01:09,630
being secured, they are at risk
from both within and without.

883
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:15,270
Always assume that every room of every
floor in each and every house contains

884
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:15,581
enemy.

885
01:01:15,581 --> 01:01:20,581
Soldiers always move very quickly when
moving in front of windows or doors.

886
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,120
Always nowhere.

887
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:27,150
Enemy positions may be in buildings that
are adjacent to yours as an all marine

888
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:29,650
operations.
Watching your buddies back,

889
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,580
watch your buddies back and run as fast
as possible when traversing open ground.

890
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:41,290
Can't let your guard down.
Can't let your guard down.

891
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,330
Where do you let your guard down?
Me? Yeah. We can't tell you it's,

892
01:01:47,331 --> 01:01:49,400
it's probably a pretty broad area.

893
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,880
100% of my life probably.
Yeah.

894
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:57,920
Is there any time where you feel
like, Hey, I need to get my guard up.

895
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:00,780
This is probably an easier
question for you. Yeah.

896
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,970
You're not just running around hyper
paranoid check. I am. Yeah. Yeah.

897
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:08,930
Know what in life you mean? Or
in Jujitsu? What like everything?

898
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:15,080
Yeah. Like I would say, I dunno it
put it this way, my guards always up,

899
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:20,040
but it's only kind of up,
I think you know it's like a 25% and

900
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:22,800
it kind of fluctuates from moment
to home and they fluctuate.

901
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:27,240
It's up from like zero to three stays
at 25 sometimes it goes up to like 30

902
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,760
sometimes certain scenarios
here check multiple stories.

903
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:35,010
Structures present an even greater
challenge than single story buildings in

904
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:38,790
medium size village or town or
small city that is dominated by one,

905
01:02:38,791 --> 01:02:42,450
two and three story buildings be very
particular about the taller buildings

906
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:47,451
which are naturally used by the
enemy as high ground if possible,

907
01:02:47,461 --> 01:02:51,720
make entry to taller multilevel buildings
via the roof and work systematically

908
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,500
and thoroughly downward.
Always look for the high ground.

909
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,320
So does that sort of the thing,
you know,

910
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:03,060
cause the high ground kind of seems
simple straight forward or whatever,

911
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:06,810
but is there like a,
a blueprint,

912
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,600
like a simple blueprint for like,

913
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,700
I remember you told me a story where
your son was talking with like a neighbor

914
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:18,600
or something who had, I don't know
if he went to Vietnam or something.

915
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,940
Like he was in, he was in the
military, whatever. And you get,

916
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:22,830
and they played like
laser tag or something.

917
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,240
His son like whooped him because he
knew the like some something. Well yeah,

918
01:03:27,241 --> 01:03:31,080
my son knew some fundamental tactics.
It was when he was younger,

919
01:03:31,081 --> 01:03:35,430
so he wasn't really up to speed yet.
He was like seven or six.

920
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,160
But you know, not up to us.
We started, you know, he was,

921
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,410
he was already through I think,

922
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:45,690
I think it was through level
seven of my tactical course. Um,

923
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:49,820
yeah, he's probably around level
seven. What tactical chorus.

924
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,740
I have like some tactical
lessons sat I run, you know,

925
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:56,190
what do you mean that you run
like as a father or as a what?

926
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,040
Like echelon front has a
tactical course. They move? No,

927
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:03,900
I had a tactical concepts that I teach
and you teach because you didn't teach me

928
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:08,780
nothing. Right. 25% cruising mode. Yeah.

929
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,830
Cause you know that's just
the standard right now.

930
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,820
If you know there's certain things you
have to learn in order to be tacked to be

931
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:17,310
proficient. And I, my son had learned,

932
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:22,311
like I had gone through seven of the
courses to understand the tactical things

933
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:28,250
and there was a friend of
my wife's friend came over.

934
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,281
He yes,

935
01:04:29,281 --> 01:04:34,281
he was a prior marine or actually
he was active duty marine and yes,

936
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:39,360
my son challenged him to a laser
tag tag competition. And yes,

937
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,690
my son was victorious
three times in a row.

938
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:46,680
And in the room he just did
simple fundamental tactics.

939
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:49,310
And it wasn't even team sport.
It was a one on one. Yeah.

940
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:54,540
So how do you defeat someone one on one?
Well you maneuver very quickly.

941
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:57,990
You don't fire from the besaint
same position multiple times.

942
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,950
You get the high ground
because you'd like,

943
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:06,750
he knew if you get onto my garage roof,
which had access with a ladder,

944
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:11,790
you're going to be able to defend that
position very thoroughly and the person

945
01:05:11,791 --> 01:05:14,280
that's below you because all you have
to do when you're on the garage roof is

946
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:17,910
doc and your hidden,
it's a parapet roof, eh.

947
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:21,490
Sorry. Are you have to use a deck up
there? Yeah, there's one access point.

948
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:24,130
How are you going to beat me?
You don't have grenades with the late,

949
01:05:24,131 --> 01:05:27,410
you'll have laser grenades and then
he's drive the high ground. Yeah.

950
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:30,880
I'm seven years old or six years old.
I have the high ground,

951
01:05:30,881 --> 01:05:34,210
I have a laser weapon. You're trying to
attack me. You're going to die. Yeah.

952
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,800
And then the next round when you're
trying to get up on that thing,

953
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:43,750
I'm not there anymore. I'm in the alleyway
up the alleyway up behind the fence.

954
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:45,880
Higher.
Still higher still.

955
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:50,890
So the high ground is kind
of like the Golden Golden
Room. Hmm. Yeah. Interesting.

956
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,860
You know, when the first time I found
out that the high ground is the,

957
01:05:54,861 --> 01:05:59,020
is the spot to be where when I
watched the movie called the Rock,

958
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,830
they're washed out in the Sean Connery
and Nicholas Cage where the navy seals

959
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:05,590
come up. You know, they got to go to
Alcatraz, they come up through the,

960
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:10,150
wherever the journey or something like
this. Yeah. And they get, you know, boom.

961
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:14,490
They're sort of surprised by the, the, I
think they're marines. Yeah. The terror.

962
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:17,380
They're mercenaries at this point.
But nonetheless,

963
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:22,840
or patriots depends exactly what,
uh, yeah. And he was like, Hey,

964
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:27,310
your guys just surrounded, uh, from an
elevated position. It's kind of like,

965
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:31,280
this is a no brainer, you know, this kind
of thing. I guess that's a thing. Yeah.

966
01:06:31,630 --> 01:06:36,020
And it is a thing, you know, and
they, and they killed them all. Yeah.

967
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:39,320
Except for Nicholas
Cage. He didn't die. Hmm.

968
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:44,860
That's, that's chemical agent,
by the way. Right. Vx Gas.

969
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:48,160
That's what I was going to say. Yeah.
But you, you'd know that was a real,

970
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,610
or are you good?
Let's be since fries.

971
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:54,190
He didn't just dive deep right into that.
I was gonna,

972
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:58,690
but you know those little
pearl, the little pearl balls
are kind of interesting.

973
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,780
Back to the book,

974
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:06,960
the mission assigned to Marine
forces during operation wasted,

975
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:10,560
he was to remove enemy forces that had
captured major sections of the ancient

976
01:07:10,561 --> 01:07:13,140
imperial capital of way
during the surprise,

977
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:17,820
Nva offensive that was quickly dubbed
the Tet offensive due to the historic

978
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:22,470
listen closely due to the historic aspect
of many of the buildings in way the

979
01:07:22,471 --> 01:07:26,790
usage of heavy weapons was significantly
restricted during the initial days of

980
01:07:26,791 --> 01:07:31,791
fighting on both sides of the river
as friendly casualties mounted and as

981
01:07:32,431 --> 01:07:36,070
initial estimates of the size
of the enemy force. In a way,

982
01:07:36,071 --> 01:07:39,030
city area was significantly increased.

983
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,150
Fire restrictions were ultimately lifted,

984
01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:47,280
so they didn't want to damage
these historical buildings,
and so they said, hey,

985
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,190
don't don't use 50 cal,
don't use whatever,

986
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:53,670
whatever weapons they
said they couldn't use,

987
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:58,000
and then eventually when the
casualties got so bad, they said, okay,

988
01:07:58,030 --> 01:08:01,090
go ahead and do what you gotta do.
I say,

989
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:06,130
rip the bandaid off, right?
If you're going to go, you go.

990
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:09,850
If you're going to go,
go, don't play around,

991
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:14,980
that's a good lesson. America
learns over and over and over again.

992
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,220
If you're going to go to war,

993
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,370
go to when you're number one
priority over everything else.

994
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:21,950
That should be to win, and by the
way, if they would have done that,

995
01:08:21,951 --> 01:08:26,930
I guarantee the city would have been
in better shape at the end because the

996
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:29,390
enemy's going to drag this thing
out and it's going to take longer.

997
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,460
You're going to have to end up destroying
every single building that's there.

998
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:32,040
Yeah,

999
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:32,873
makes sense.

1000
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:37,420
They continue.
In our respectful opinion,

1001
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,040
our ability to successfully complete the
mission was initially severely impacted

1002
01:08:42,041 --> 01:08:44,020
by the rules of engagement.
Again,

1003
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,570
this is a lack of trust up
and down the chain of command.

1004
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:50,230
If I have to impose strict rules
of engagement on my people,

1005
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,250
I haven't trained them well enough. I
don't trust them. They don't trust me.

1006
01:08:54,251 --> 01:08:58,660
They don't understand the strategic
mission and we have a real problem.

1007
01:08:59,000 --> 01:08:59,833
Hmm.

1008
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:02,920
Continuing.

1009
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,430
Although it is understood that mission
and rules of engagement are not the

1010
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:10,090
exclusive responsibility of marine
leadership at the platoon company,

1011
01:09:10,091 --> 01:09:11,980
battalion or even regimental level.

1012
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:16,330
It is strongly recommended that every
effort is made at every level in the chain

1013
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:21,331
of command to ensure that balance has
been achieved between the demands of the

1014
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:25,960
mission and the effect of the rules of
engagement on the ability of the command

1015
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:30,510
to perform the mission successfully.
Yes,

1016
01:09:30,511 --> 01:09:31,830
you do have to have balance,

1017
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:38,570
but what you really should have is trust
and understanding of the situation so

1018
01:09:40,261 --> 01:09:43,740
that people don't need to
be constrained by rules.

1019
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:50,560
If I have, if I, if my leaders
understand what I want them to do

1020
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:55,490
and they understand the constraints and
they understand the mission and they

1021
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,830
understand the impact,
they don't need any rules at all.

1022
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,920
They just need to get told to go.
Yeah.

1023
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:06,300
I think about like certain laws where
if this is going to be the law of the

1024
01:10:06,431 --> 01:10:09,520
land,
that this law applies to everybody.

1025
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:11,590
Same thing with rules of
engagement where they got it,

1026
01:10:11,591 --> 01:10:14,370
cause they kinda got to apply to
everyone. Right. In a certain way.

1027
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:19,810
So that's why they wind up
being so strict or they can, um,

1028
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:24,520
and I'm thinking about laws to where
there's certain groups or individuals that

1029
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:27,610
it's like, man, that La kind of shitting
and apply it to me because I know better.

1030
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,730
You know like where like you
don't like the guy who's like,

1031
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,490
okay unquiet as this
red light, right, this,

1032
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:38,500
this or this stoplight where the crossroad
of that stop light is a dirt road.

1033
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:43,360
And on both, if you turn in the
dirt road, either direction,

1034
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:45,820
there's a gate that's always
closed. It's only Click, oh,

1035
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:49,060
it's for like Cain trucks and stuff. Or
it was, I don't know what it is now, but,

1036
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:52,560
and the cane truck guys have the
key to the gate. This big long get,

1037
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:55,450
you can't even turn in there, but
there's still a stoplight, right?

1038
01:10:56,230 --> 01:11:00,710
So it's never read because it
only turns green when the kitten,

1039
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,820
but every once in a while it'd be red
and the gate will be closed, you know,

1040
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,720
and all that sort of happens. And here's
the thing, you can see the gates quote,

1041
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,960
no truck is coming. Even if a truck was
coming, like they got to stop that open,

1042
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:11,794
they get whatever.

1043
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:16,200
Should you stay at that red stoplight
or can you just blow through the light?

1044
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:23,030
You would think any responsible adult
should have the authority or whatever to

1045
01:11:24,181 --> 01:11:28,650
see that and just go through the light.
But the rules got applied to everybody.

1046
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:30,530
That's the thing.
It has to apply to everyone.

1047
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:32,130
And what about the new driver who's like,

1048
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:37,640
they can discern quite as well where a
safe red light running situation versus a

1049
01:11:39,121 --> 01:11:43,260
not so safe red light running situation.
And then there's a spectrum, you know,

1050
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,510
so when these rules get put in place,

1051
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:49,530
they got to apply to everybody at
the lowest common denominator person.

1052
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:54,680
And unfortunately these highest co hired
denominational people got apply to them

1053
01:11:56,701 --> 01:12:00,300
too because you know, you can't
just go down the line and be like,

1054
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:02,580
okay this rule applies to you,
but kind of kind of, you know,

1055
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:06,840
just maybe 30% this rule applies
to him hundred percent of course,

1056
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:11,190
and him to you 1% cause you're this
elite dude so you can, you know,

1057
01:12:11,191 --> 01:12:13,770
you have ultimate flicks, you
know, it's hard to do that,

1058
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:15,600
especially when you do it
like a bunch of people.

1059
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:19,230
So that's why that can be a pain in the
ass sometimes. You see what I'm saying?

1060
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:21,580
Three apparently that's been
bothering you for quite some time.

1061
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:25,320
How long have you lived
in America for mainland?

1062
01:12:25,390 --> 01:12:28,830
Like think about like the court
system or like, you know, yeah,

1063
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:33,860
no rules get put in place for
sure because people don't trust

1064
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:39,240
the subordinates that have
to follow the rule. Right?

1065
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,140
You tell your kid you're not allowed
to go in the yard because the pools out

1066
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,670
there, right. What
you're really saying is,

1067
01:12:44,671 --> 01:12:48,300
I don't trust that you're not going to
go in the pool or I don't trust that

1068
01:12:48,301 --> 01:12:51,180
you're that you can swim well enough.
If you're a good leader, you'll be like,

1069
01:12:51,181 --> 01:12:52,470
okay, we got it. We need to work on this.

1070
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:54,990
You can do understand the dangers and
that's a little bit of a weird thing to

1071
01:12:54,991 --> 01:12:57,090
talk about because drum and
a pool for a little kid,

1072
01:12:57,091 --> 01:12:58,950
you obviously have to err
towards the side of safety.

1073
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:00,690
That's probably not the best example,

1074
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,870
but if you tell your kid no
one's allowed to come to, okay,

1075
01:13:03,871 --> 01:13:07,980
I'm going on a trip Friday night,
no one come over to the house.

1076
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:09,760
Those are the rules.
You know?

1077
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:13,140
If my kids actually understood
what I really meant is like, hey,

1078
01:13:13,141 --> 01:13:16,200
if you want to have a couple kids
over, that's cool. Don't get crazy.

1079
01:13:16,201 --> 01:13:20,580
Don't eat my food. Weird to stay away
from the milk. No Weirdos, no. You know,

1080
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:23,850
if they understood all that,
which actually that's what
my kids were like, Hey,

1081
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:26,200
I've got a couple kids coming
over. It's all good. You know?

1082
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:28,050
If they broke the trust,

1083
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:32,340
then things might be different than
I have to go and implement rules.

1084
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,060
Yeah. But on top of that year, you're
talking about like your kids or like,

1085
01:13:37,061 --> 01:13:37,301
you know,

1086
01:13:37,301 --> 01:13:40,570
in the military if you're dealing with
like one unit or one little group of

1087
01:13:40,571 --> 01:13:41,404
people,

1088
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,210
but if the rules of engagement or in
your case like the rule of people coming

1089
01:13:46,211 --> 01:13:48,430
over, what if, what if it
didn't just apply to your kids?

1090
01:13:48,431 --> 01:13:51,310
What if it applied to the whole
block or the whole town or whatever.

1091
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:55,420
So it's like, just to keep everyone safe.
We've got to sell. This is the standard,

1092
01:13:55,421 --> 01:13:58,430
which is why we don't
want communism. Yes, yes.

1093
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:01,510
They just make tunnels that are
and blanket over every, well,

1094
01:14:01,511 --> 01:14:05,950
that's how laws are even here. Sure. The
gun laws consider the gun lots for sure.

1095
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:09,010
Like, Hey, we need background check, but
the gold rules got apply to everyone.

1096
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,010
You know, you can't
discriminate kind of thing. They

1097
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:15,580
have to apply to everybody. So
it's like, man, well yeah, that's,

1098
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:20,610
the gun rules are a perfect example
because they don't trust the people.

1099
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,990
Everyone. Yeah. Certain people you know.
Oh, everyone just can't have a gun.

1100
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:30,130
You have to get her background check.
Okay, fair enough. Why? But then it goes,

1101
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:32,110
then it continues. See
that's, that's where,

1102
01:14:32,111 --> 01:14:34,810
that's where you run into products where
there's so much debate about gun laws

1103
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:37,930
because pretty much everyone
says, hey, I get it.

1104
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:41,020
You should probably get some kind of a
background check before you get a firearm.

1105
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,410
Everyone goes, hm, okay. I
don't want somebody that's been,

1106
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:47,860
I don't want somebody that's a felon or
a violent criminal to be able to get a

1107
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:51,930
gun. Cool. I agree with that. The
problem is where does it stop? Yeah.

1108
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:57,070
And, and then the problem on
top of that is because of the,

1109
01:14:57,071 --> 01:14:59,530
where does it stop?
Because of the slippery slope thing.

1110
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:04,660
The people that don't want any gun
laws, they just said, we don't want any,

1111
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:07,470
like every single, you know,
while we think we should,

1112
01:15:07,471 --> 01:15:11,970
that the background checks should
be an extra three days, no work.

1113
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,870
And meanwhile,
on the other side,

1114
01:15:14,890 --> 01:15:19,890
people are saying every single thing that
they can do to restrict firearms from

1115
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,320
being had by anybody.
They try and move it there.

1116
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:28,480
So both sides or just take an extreme
position and no one will actually have a

1117
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:32,380
normal logical conversation
about what's going on.

1118
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:36,370
It's just, and even when you
do minute yelling and screaming

1119
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:41,590
from the polar polarized positions.
Yeah, and I, and a lot of times,

1120
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:43,360
even if you're in that in the moment,

1121
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:46,810
like you can step back and see that when
that happens, when people are just like,

1122
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:46,961
hey,

1123
01:15:46,961 --> 01:15:49,930
you're just defending your position just
to just kind of blindly or whatever,

1124
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:52,170
you can see that happen.
I'm not saying like it's so terrible.

1125
01:15:52,171 --> 01:15:53,800
I don't think it's natural.
I get it.

1126
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:57,910
But even if you can have like
an un Un civilized discussion,

1127
01:15:57,911 --> 01:16:00,670
it's still hard because
it's based on people. Yeah.

1128
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,370
Because it could be good
because like for me,

1129
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,960
I should absolutely be ha be able
to have whatever guns I want.

1130
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:14,440
Yeah. Right. That's, that's the way I
feel. I feel that I should be able to,

1131
01:16:14,441 --> 01:16:16,720
and I sh yes,
you can check my background.

1132
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:21,130
You can see if I am a felon
or a violent criminal.

1133
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:23,350
You can see that I'm not okay.
You should be able to,

1134
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:27,820
I should be able to get
whatever guns I want and,

1135
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,000
but there's some people
that think, hey, you know,

1136
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:32,770
but as strongly as I feel about that,

1137
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:35,740
as strong as I feel like I should be
able to what? Get whatever guns I want.

1138
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:36,993
If someone says,

1139
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:42,030
oh well then you agree that everyone
should be able to get every gun they want

1140
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:45,580
to know.
Actually I don't agree with that.

1141
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,180
I think that there's some
people that don't need guns.

1142
01:16:49,660 --> 01:16:54,490
I can say that. I can say that without,
without thinking, without saying,

1143
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:59,440
oh well Jocko believes in gun
control for everyone. It's like, no,

1144
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:01,000
I just said what I believed.

1145
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:06,030
So the rules are about trust and you
have to figure out where the trust lies

1146
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:08,710
with everyone,
by the way.

1147
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:11,600
And you have to figure out what the
minimum amount of trust is that you can

1148
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:14,270
overlay on people everywhere.
That's where,

1149
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:17,310
that's why governing of
giant country so hard. Yeah.

1150
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,450
And depending on where you live too,
because depending on where you live,

1151
01:17:20,451 --> 01:17:24,380
you have different needs.
You have different, like
there's some people that live,

1152
01:17:25,170 --> 01:17:27,800
the culture is different,
but depending on where you live,

1153
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:32,890
like if you live in a state where there's
predatory animals and you live out in

1154
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:36,740
the bush somewhere, you're
damn right. You need guns.

1155
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,730
If you live in a state where there's
predatory animals that are human beings

1156
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:41,940
that will break in your
house and kill you,

1157
01:17:41,941 --> 01:17:44,870
I guess what you also need to be
able to protect your family. Yeah,

1158
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:48,820
that's good to go. You know, uh,

1159
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:54,080
somebody asked me the other day is
like, is, is uh, it's actually Tim,

1160
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:54,950
it was actually Tim Ferriss.

1161
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:58,880
He was asking me if pepper spray
is good home defense. I'm like,

1162
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:04,730
pepper sprays, good home defense against
a person that isn't carrying a weapon.

1163
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:09,080
I said, but if someone's breaking into
your house or coming to attack you,

1164
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:11,790
are they not going to have a weapon?
Do,

1165
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:15,500
are they following some kind of a rules
of engagement? Were there I am. Hey,

1166
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:19,430
I'm going on a basic B and e tonight.
I'm only going to bring, um, you know,

1167
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,480
I'm only gonna bring my, my, my
pillow to hit people with like, no,

1168
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:26,740
they're breaking in your house to kill
you or they're breaking in your house too

1169
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:30,560
to assault your family or whatever.
The breaking into your house too.

1170
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,710
They shouldn't be breaking into your house
and they're probably going to be able

1171
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:35,630
to defend themselves because
they don't want to get caught.

1172
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:37,220
So what do they do to defend themselves?

1173
01:18:37,221 --> 01:18:41,000
They got a knife and they got out whatever
they gotta go nine. So pepper spray.

1174
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,720
Great. The problem with pepper
sprays, you, you don't, you don't,

1175
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:48,590
they're not following the rules of
engagement. The rules of engagement. Yeah.

1176
01:18:48,591 --> 01:18:51,920
That's a good question too.
But like pepper spray,

1177
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:55,460
why would you use like think of a real
scenario where you would use pepper spray

1178
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:57,510
as a, as a human girl? I get it.

1179
01:18:57,530 --> 01:19:00,500
Cause you have valuable goods
regardless of where you go. Yeah.

1180
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,610
You can be at the post stuff.

1181
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:05,900
He's still got those valuable goods
that predators might want as a girl.

1182
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:09,500
But let's say, okay, I'm Tim Ferriss
or I'm, you know, me or whatever.

1183
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,140
Why when would I use the
prepper pepper spray?

1184
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:17,060
Realistic that I'm sure there's only one
10 was just asking that because it's a

1185
01:19:17,061 --> 01:19:18,980
legitimate question because
if someone says, look,

1186
01:19:18,981 --> 01:19:21,740
I'm not really comfortable with guns,
but if someone wants comes into my house,

1187
01:19:21,741 --> 01:19:24,980
I want to build to defend myself, I'm
going to get pepper spray. And the the,

1188
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:29,420
the real quick answers like, yeah, okay,
cool. Yep. Better than it makes you go,

1189
01:19:29,421 --> 01:19:31,970
oh that kind of makes sense.
Right. At least you got something.

1190
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,860
The reality is the person's coming in
your house, it's pepper spray is great.

1191
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:40,340
As long as they don't have a knife,
as long as they don't have a gun,

1192
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:45,700
in which case the pepper spray is doing
you no good cause you pepper spray me

1193
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:48,020
and I have a knife. I'm going to
grab a hold of you. I'm going to,

1194
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:49,700
I'm going to cut your head off.

1195
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,340
That's what's going to happen
in a situation that you,

1196
01:19:52,341 --> 01:19:53,450
you got to use the pepper spray.

1197
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:56,930
So like if someone's like burglarizing
you and you turn it on the light and they

1198
01:19:56,931 --> 01:19:59,450
scatter, you don't need the pepper
spray for that kind of situation.

1199
01:19:59,451 --> 01:20:01,940
You know pepper spray is for
someone who like, well yeah,

1200
01:20:01,941 --> 01:20:04,100
but you don't know that they're
going to scatter. But yeah,

1201
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,050
just like you don't know if they
have a gun or not. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

1202
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,190
And if you're prowling
around in someone's house,

1203
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,670
you're going to be in a serious situation.
Yeah. I think he should be. Yeah.

1204
01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:17,820
Are you're going to be in
a real bad situation. Yeah.

1205
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:22,170
So that's what rules are and rules
of engagement. So going back,

1206
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:24,570
we're trying to bring this back.
Rules of engagement. That's exactly,

1207
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:28,500
that's exactly why rules of engagement
can be tricky, but they shouldn't be.

1208
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,050
If you train your people well,

1209
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,540
if the people understand
what the strategic mission,

1210
01:20:33,541 --> 01:20:34,560
if they understand what the parameters,

1211
01:20:34,561 --> 01:20:37,230
you put the parameters on in there and
they're loose enough that people can

1212
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:39,420
maneuver inside those parameters.

1213
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:43,680
Then occasionally they got to call you up
and say, Hey, I had to break the rules.

1214
01:20:44,220 --> 01:20:46,650
And you say, Oh, what happened?
And they explained it, then
you go, okay, good call.

1215
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,260
Yeah, yeah. People need to understand that

1216
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:58,740
continuing on urban combat is nearly
always conducted at very close quarters.

1217
01:20:58,741 --> 01:21:02,700
It is not uncommon to have opposing
forces fighting from positions a few dozen

1218
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,533
meters apart.

1219
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:07,080
Most of the fighting is done from a
distance between 50 and 500 meters due to

1220
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:08,250
this close in nature.

1221
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:12,960
It is critical to know where the enemy
is and how they are deployed. Again,

1222
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:17,640
this is a fantasy like knowing where
the enemy is and how they're deployed is

1223
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:20,490
really hard to do even when you have,

1224
01:21:20,910 --> 01:21:25,560
even when you have overhead coverage
looking in the city, I'll tell,

1225
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:28,380
I'll give you an example.
I was watching my guys out on a mission.

1226
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:32,100
I was watching on a a UAV feed,

1227
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,990
so we're watching,

1228
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:39,020
we're watching and looking for enemy and
all of a sudden we see weird activity.

1229
01:21:39,481 --> 01:21:41,730
There's a vehicle,
the vehicle stops,

1230
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:44,520
the vehicle kind of moves a little
bit stops. Again, guys get out,

1231
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:45,450
they look around,

1232
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:50,250
open up the trunk and now
we're totally focused like, oh,

1233
01:21:50,251 --> 01:21:51,900
these guys are getting ready to attack.

1234
01:21:52,140 --> 01:21:56,100
Open up the trunk and as they're
starting to pull stuff out of the trunk,

1235
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:59,040
My guys get hit from a different spot
that we weren't looking cause you can't

1236
01:21:59,041 --> 01:22:02,550
see everything, especially in a city
because think of it with buildings.

1237
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:05,940
As soon as you go off angle a little bit,

1238
01:22:05,970 --> 01:22:09,350
you can't see the street anymore because
it's down in the building. So we're,

1239
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:13,050
we actually are totally focused on
this one thing and maneuvering the,

1240
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:18,090
the air asset to look at
these people in a car and as,

1241
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:20,880
as there as we're monitoring these guys,

1242
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:23,520
these suspected enemy personnel,

1243
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:26,640
all of a sudden my guys get shot at from
somewhere else and we completely miss

1244
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:27,474
it.

1245
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:32,480
And we continue to watch these guys and
they pull out a jack and attire and they

1246
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:37,950
lift up the car and they changed the
tire and they leave. They're just normal.

1247
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:39,540
But it looked very suspect.

1248
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:42,810
So to think that you're ever going to
know where the enemy is and how they're

1249
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:46,860
deployed is very, very challenging.
At best you do the best.

1250
01:22:46,861 --> 01:22:49,110
It doesn't mean you don't try.
You definitely try, but you,

1251
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:53,010
you don't get all that information.
You just don't get it. Those Uavs,

1252
01:22:53,370 --> 01:22:57,870
how high are those? Depends
on the UAV. So like w can you,

1253
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:00,270
can they see him?
Like can people see them or are they,

1254
01:23:00,271 --> 01:23:02,890
it depends on the UAV and like I'm,

1255
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:05,640
I don't know what the
classification of all that is. Saw.

1256
01:23:05,641 --> 01:23:07,930
I'm not talking about it good.
I don't know what the,

1257
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:09,910
I just know that they go
to different heights. I'll,

1258
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:13,270
I'll leave it at that because on the
Internet you can see those, you know,

1259
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:16,870
those videos. Every once in
a while they'll just have
them. Then it's like, Dang,

1260
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:19,390
those guys don't even see that.
Or you know,

1261
01:23:19,391 --> 01:23:23,800
I don't know if they do or donor good
optics to look real good optics. I mean,

1262
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:27,450
just imagine, you know, the optics that
we have in the civilian sector. Yeah.

1263
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:31,390
Even those are good enough to
be pretty amazing. Yes sir. So,

1264
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:33,610
uh,

1265
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:36,340
talking about knowing where the enemy
has this lesson was learned the hard way

1266
01:23:36,341 --> 01:23:38,530
during the initial stages of
the battle inside the citadel.

1267
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:42,340
During the first two major clashes between
marine and Nva forces on the morning

1268
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:43,930
of 13, February, 1968,

1269
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:47,890
the enemy surprised us and wreaked
significant damages very quickly.

1270
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:53,590
This was because we weren't exactly sure
where they were. Although the, the Arvin,

1271
01:23:53,591 --> 01:23:54,290
which is the,
uh,

1272
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:59,290
the South Vietnamese army had been in
several major battles inside the citadel.

1273
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:03,550
I don't recall receiving any intelligence
attribute ID attributed to them

1274
01:24:03,551 --> 01:24:06,640
regarding the enemy's exact location.
Further to my knowledge,

1275
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:10,000
no marine recon unit was sent to check
out the situation before attacking on the

1276
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,880
morning of the 13th.
So that's rough.

1277
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:17,140
And I'll tell you one
thing that from my mind,

1278
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:18,640
where's the enemy?
The enemy is everywhere.

1279
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:22,570
And you have to approach things
as if the enemy can be anywhere.

1280
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:26,230
And the only way you can know that they're
not where they're not everywhere is

1281
01:24:26,231 --> 01:24:29,050
when you take something down and you
secure it. That's when you know not there,

1282
01:24:29,051 --> 01:24:29,884
then you move on.

1283
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:34,240
We recommend that all intelligence assets,

1284
01:24:34,241 --> 01:24:37,930
recon units and surveillance devices that
can be made available are deployed in

1285
01:24:37,931 --> 01:24:41,380
a significant effort to fix the exact
location of enemy soldiers and units.

1286
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:45,940
Again, this is, you can see where this
is coming out of this. For these guys,

1287
01:24:45,941 --> 01:24:50,050
they must have been completely outflanked
all the time where they were thinking,

1288
01:24:50,051 --> 01:24:51,250
where is the enemy?

1289
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:56,110
We need to know where the enemy is and
it's a really hard to know that the enemy

1290
01:24:56,111 --> 01:24:59,230
can combatant who knows where
his enemy is. Hiding experiences,

1291
01:24:59,590 --> 01:25:04,120
experiences a decided advantage in
surprise and the deployment of firepower.

1292
01:25:04,210 --> 01:25:08,290
Of course. Now again, this
doesn't, like I'm saying,

1293
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:10,450
it's hard to have definitely
doesn't mean you mitigate.

1294
01:25:10,451 --> 01:25:13,870
It doesn't mean you don't put up Uav so
you can see maneuver doesn't mean you

1295
01:25:13,871 --> 01:25:14,710
don't gather intelligence,

1296
01:25:14,711 --> 01:25:18,100
doesn't mean people shouldn't report
back in and explain where they think the

1297
01:25:18,101 --> 01:25:19,630
enemy is.
We at least have an estimate

1298
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:25,210
continuing week combat
urban combat tactics.

1299
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:29,530
The tragedy of urban conflict is that
the battlefield for each firefight is a

1300
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:30,364
neighborhood.

1301
01:25:30,730 --> 01:25:35,110
Each objective taken is someone's home
or a school or church or some other

1302
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:39,130
structure that has value and foe and
more or less significant meaning to its

1303
01:25:39,131 --> 01:25:42,010
inhabitants.
Considering the possibilities,

1304
01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:45,910
it is not difficult to imagine tank
battles across mall parking, lots,

1305
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:50,290
mortar fire hitting a church, a hospital,
a community center, heavy small arms,

1306
01:25:50,291 --> 01:25:54,340
fire fights between homes and
artillery barrage on a school yard.

1307
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:58,720
While these images may be grist
for the mills of Hollywood,

1308
01:25:58,721 --> 01:25:59,890
when we think about them in,

1309
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:04,220
in relevance to our homes and
our neighborhood and churches,

1310
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:08,000
the tragedy is somehow increased.
However,

1311
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:13,240
it is our collective belief that the
life of one Marine is more precious than

1312
01:26:13,341 --> 01:26:18,290
ten one hundred homes,
schools, churches, shrines,

1313
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,470
shopping malls,
or any other building known demand.

1314
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:23,350
Okay.

1315
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:23,891
Therefore,

1316
01:26:23,891 --> 01:26:28,390
all efforts should be made using any and
all weapons tree available to stun the

1317
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:33,391
enemy and support marine advances through
the use of supporting arms and without

1318
01:26:33,431 --> 01:26:35,470
regard to damage to buildings.

1319
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:42,150
So clearly the whole idea
that this started off with
of the rules of engagement,

1320
01:26:42,851 --> 01:26:45,820
that we're restricting heavy fire power
because the historical nature of the

1321
01:26:45,821 --> 01:26:47,050
city,
a,

1322
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:52,570
if you don't want historical
buildings destroyed, don't have a war.

1323
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:59,750
And if you think we should save a building
and that's going to cost the life of

1324
01:27:00,001 --> 01:27:01,770
one of our brothers not happening.

1325
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,163
Hmm.

1326
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,630
Continuing at the same time,

1327
01:27:06,631 --> 01:27:11,631
the use of heavy weapon tree in urban
combat isn't assuredly two edged sword as

1328
01:27:11,671 --> 01:27:13,710
are many assets in modern warfare.

1329
01:27:13,711 --> 01:27:18,711
Rubble can be nearly as effective as
a building for protecting enemy firing

1330
01:27:20,101 --> 01:27:20,611
positions.

1331
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:24,510
Further artillery and other
flat trajectory weapons
may be somewhat restricted

1332
01:27:24,511 --> 01:27:27,840
by the height of buildings and their
distance from each other. In many cases,

1333
01:27:27,841 --> 01:27:28,351
mortars,

1334
01:27:28,351 --> 01:27:33,351
although smaller in caliber were superior
because of their higher trajectory.

1335
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,770
So interestingly,
indirect fire,

1336
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:44,390
indirect fire taking the indirect
approach is often better than the flat

1337
01:27:44,911 --> 01:27:47,760
trajectory. I'm going to shoot
through your front door. No,

1338
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:49,760
we're going to lob in some rounds on you.
So,

1339
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:51,900
so we think about that when
we're dealing with people.

1340
01:27:52,440 --> 01:27:56,820
Punching him in the face is not as good
as coming from an indirect position

1341
01:27:57,030 --> 01:27:59,040
where they don't quite see
where it's coming from,

1342
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,580
but it still gives them
a little crack and the,

1343
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:04,060
it's even to the point where he says the,
um,

1344
01:28:04,710 --> 01:28:06,660
even though they're smaller in caliber,

1345
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:11,580
so even though somebody does something
that you want to straighten him out on

1346
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:14,490
when you hit him in the face,
we know what the reaction is.

1347
01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:18,030
They get defensive and all the things.
When we come from a, from a flank,

1348
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:23,220
indirect fire, it's smaller. Caliber is
not even as, it's doesn't hate his heart.

1349
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:26,640
Yeah. But it's more effective.
Yeah. Just more effective

1350
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:33,390
indirect fire all day long, continuing
supporting arms, supporting arms,

1351
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,700
the most effective or most
effective prior to danger,

1352
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:39,240
close to minimize the potential
of friendly casualties
and maximize preperatory

1353
01:28:39,241 --> 01:28:43,000
fires to support the infantry's
attack during operation wasted.

1354
01:28:43,001 --> 01:28:46,710
Even the most effective indirect fire
during danger close was from an eight inch

1355
01:28:46,711 --> 01:28:50,580
gun. We recommend that the supporting
access of fire be perpendicular as well as

1356
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:54,750
parallel. Finally in the event as
in the case of operation waste city,

1357
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:59,340
that due to political considerations that
proper preperatory fires would not be

1358
01:28:59,341 --> 01:29:03,360
allowed, that a variety of fires
such as smoke delayed fuses,

1359
01:29:03,361 --> 01:29:08,340
high angle can be incorporated with the
infantry's attack combined arms training

1360
01:29:08,341 --> 01:29:09,870
for urban combat is critical.

1361
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:14,170
It's cover and move.

1362
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,940
That's what supporting arms do.
They lay down cover so you can maneuver.

1363
01:29:19,980 --> 01:29:23,550
Other advantage of preperatory
fire include the destruction
of the camouflage of

1364
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:24,420
enemy positions,

1365
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:28,110
the psychological shock factor against
enemy troops and the fact that heavy

1366
01:29:28,111 --> 01:29:33,111
weapons can create new avenues of
attack and Egress for armored vehicles.

1367
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:34,230
Pretty straight forward.

1368
01:29:36,930 --> 01:29:40,320
One of the most effective aspects of
supporting arms during the battle of way

1369
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:45,321
where the killer teams that evolved the
m 48 tank and the end an Antos and the

1370
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:51,390
Antos is like, uh, it's, it's actually
a pretty crazy looking machine.

1371
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:56,391
It's got 160 106 millimeter like cannons
on it and it's got six of them and

1372
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:58,290
they're kind of like sticking out.

1373
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,470
Then it's a light armored vehicles and
it's like a tank anti-tank vehicle,

1374
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,090
but I'm Antos would pair up and
maneuver together as a team.

1375
01:30:06,091 --> 01:30:09,060
This would allow either the tank or
the Antos to maneuver into a good fire

1376
01:30:09,061 --> 01:30:11,400
position where while the other covered

1377
01:30:13,190 --> 01:30:14,950
covering cover move,
thank you.

1378
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:16,601
Further,

1379
01:30:16,601 --> 01:30:20,500
the devastating fire power put out by
the 90 millimeter tank cannon and the six

1380
01:30:20,501 --> 01:30:23,740
one oh six is of the autos turned out
to be extremely beneficial because their

1381
01:30:23,741 --> 01:30:26,890
capabilities to deliver
pinpoint of firepower.

1382
01:30:27,490 --> 01:30:32,020
Armored vehicles can provide many
benefits to the infantry engaged in urban

1383
01:30:32,021 --> 01:30:36,100
combat as they provide some
cover from and small arms fire.

1384
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:37,270
However,

1385
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:41,180
armored vehicles can also become rocket
magnets producing casualties for an

1386
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:43,540
infantry troops in close proximity.

1387
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:46,930
The enemy's going to see that target.

1388
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:47,953
Yeah,

1389
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,380
and they're going to
like it. Yeah, and you,

1390
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:55,310
there's advantages to having that power,
but there's also disadvantaged,

1391
01:30:55,311 --> 01:30:57,860
so you have to always weigh
those things out. As a leader,

1392
01:30:57,861 --> 01:30:59,870
you have to pay attention to those things.
As a leader,

1393
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,420
you have to think of every
advantage that you have.

1394
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:04,550
There's going to be some negative to it.

1395
01:31:04,551 --> 01:31:07,070
There's going to be some disadvantage
when you bring an advantage to the table.

1396
01:31:07,071 --> 01:31:10,580
There's going to be some
disadvantage in Jujitsu, right?

1397
01:31:10,610 --> 01:31:12,440
If we're going to be super flexible,
you're not that strong.

1398
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:14,480
Every gonna be Super Superstrong
are not that flexible.

1399
01:31:15,180 --> 01:31:17,300
Your cardio doesn't last very long.
Right?

1400
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,440
So there's going to be advantages and
disadvantages that come with each asset

1401
01:31:21,441 --> 01:31:25,130
that you have. Yeah. So you have to
figure you're going to go for full ox.

1402
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:28,250
That's cool. You're giving up position.
Yeah. There's all kinds of things.

1403
01:31:28,340 --> 01:31:30,800
You have to weigh those out and as
leader you have to look at, don't get,

1404
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:35,240
don't get wrapped around the positives
of something. Right. Just the positives.

1405
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:38,420
There's not just positives
for for really anything. Yeah.

1406
01:31:38,930 --> 01:31:43,100
There's nothing that's just
straight positives across
the board, I guess. Right?

1407
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:46,460
Yeah. I'm sure we could think of
something, and I'm sure you could

1408
01:31:50,220 --> 01:31:53,990
continue with, other than instances
of harassment and interdiction fires,

1409
01:31:53,991 --> 01:31:57,140
buildings that are hit by heavy
weapons should be attacked immediately.

1410
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,670
This is good.

1411
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:01,780
Buildings that are hit by heavy
weapon should be attacked immediately.

1412
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:06,730
Don't hesitate. You catch people off
guard. Don't hesitate. Don't hesitate.

1413
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:10,630
This happens. This happens in,
in everything we, we get a good,

1414
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:12,580
a good position or something,

1415
01:32:12,640 --> 01:32:15,710
an advantageous happens and we hesitated
instead of taking the advantage of it,

1416
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:20,380
we got, Oh God got to here. Yeah.
And then, then we, then we let it go.

1417
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:25,060
It happens in business too. We get to
a situation all we finally get the,

1418
01:32:25,150 --> 01:32:30,150
we finally get our competitor to make a
mistake or we get an advantage position

1419
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:36,170
and we celebrate instead of
just finishing the job. Yeah.

1420
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,890
Which is a big bad thing to do.
Yeah.

1421
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:41,950
Okay.

1422
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:44,990
Remember that when calling in fire
missions, you were can request splash,

1423
01:32:44,991 --> 01:32:48,070
so you're friendly troops have time to
take cover immediately prior to impact,

1424
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,280
these cats were calling and
bombs right on top of them a lot.

1425
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,393
Hmm.

1426
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,940
In daytime operations,

1427
01:32:53,941 --> 01:32:57,130
that use of covering smoke
is often helpful when marines
must attack across open

1428
01:32:57,131 --> 01:32:57,964
areas.

1429
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,993
Yeah.

1430
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:03,500
As was learned during operation way city.

1431
01:33:03,501 --> 01:33:05,400
Even with proper support of heavy weapons,

1432
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:07,620
which was ultimately
provided to the marines.

1433
01:33:07,621 --> 01:33:12,330
We faced hardcore north Vietnamese
army troops who fought from prepared

1434
01:33:12,331 --> 01:33:15,000
positions, move to secondary
positions, fought again,

1435
01:33:15,001 --> 01:33:19,440
and finally very reluctantly died
and the capture of each room,

1436
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:23,160
each for each rooftop,
each building, each street.

1437
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:26,520
It was ultimately the marine
riflemen who won the battle.

1438
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:31,763
Okay.

1439
01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:35,640
As a leader,
as a leader,

1440
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:40,710
do you always have to remember that line
right there in the capture of each room,

1441
01:33:40,740 --> 01:33:42,930
each for each roof top,
each building, each street.

1442
01:33:42,931 --> 01:33:47,160
It was ultimately the marine rifleman
who won the battle. As a leader,

1443
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:52,910
if you think that all you need to do
is make a good decision and then you're

1444
01:33:55,411 --> 01:33:56,910
going to win, you're wrong. Yeah.

1445
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:02,270
The folks on the front line have to
truly understand what is happening and

1446
01:34:02,311 --> 01:34:06,510
they're the ones are going to carry the
day and you could come up with the best

1447
01:34:06,511 --> 01:34:10,410
battle plan ever. You could come up with
the best strategic business plan ever,

1448
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:14,640
and if you don't have folks that are
engaged and willing and are going to take

1449
01:34:14,641 --> 01:34:18,450
the fight to the enemy and are
going to win that, that foothold,

1450
01:34:18,720 --> 01:34:20,430
they're going to enter that room.

1451
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:25,440
They're going to go out and sell into
whatever industry you're trying to get

1452
01:34:25,441 --> 01:34:29,790
into. If you don't have people
that you trust, that are trained,

1453
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:32,340
that are ready,
that are prepared if you don't have them,

1454
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,490
best paddle battle plan in
the world isn't going to work.

1455
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:36,423
Hmm.

1456
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:41,470
Is Critical for infantry units,
snow,

1457
01:34:41,471 --> 01:34:45,250
both the capabilities as well as
the limitations of supporting arms

1458
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:49,640
know your limitations,
right. This is, again,

1459
01:34:49,641 --> 01:34:51,200
there's positives and there's negatives.

1460
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:58,460
Another aspect of supporting arms,
limitations to do with helicopter support.

1461
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:02,240
Urban terrain is not very forgiving to
helicopters that may be forced to make an

1462
01:35:02,241 --> 01:35:02,721
emergency.

1463
01:35:02,721 --> 01:35:07,210
Landing helicopter pilots might be
reluctant to fly over urban terrain.

1464
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:10,960
No.
These things.

1465
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:17,810
One very tragic aspect of using supporting
arms in urban combat is that the

1466
01:35:17,811 --> 01:35:22,130
likelihood of civilian casualties is very
high and at least two situations that

1467
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:22,964
we are aware of.

1468
01:35:23,210 --> 01:35:28,210
The NVA used civilians as screens for
their infantry troops and fire missions

1469
01:35:28,611 --> 01:35:32,330
were of necessity called
in on those positions.

1470
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:36,143
So

1471
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:42,023
no

1472
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:48,070
expect pretty discussed these things.
Let your troops understand,

1473
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,170
put them in role plays scenarios where
they have to make a decision on what's

1474
01:35:51,171 --> 01:35:52,004
happening.

1475
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:57,040
It's better to think through it 20 times
and make 20 mistakes while we're doing

1476
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:02,420
some kind of a role play scenario than
it is to have to be making that decision

1477
01:36:02,421 --> 01:36:05,990
for the first time. When you're on
the battlefield and you can't discuss,

1478
01:36:05,991 --> 01:36:10,970
you can't debrief. Yeah. Not to mention
the stress that's going to kind of,

1479
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,950
yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

1480
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:19,220
Use of chemical weapons during one fives
battle inside the citadel fortress,

1481
01:36:19,221 --> 01:36:21,740
which was kicked off on 13 February,

1482
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:25,580
1968 the battalion progressed a total of
four blocks along our avenue of attack

1483
01:36:25,581 --> 01:36:29,480
and had secured a total of 16 city blocks
within our assigned area of operations.

1484
01:36:29,481 --> 01:36:34,370
After nearly two weeks of heavy street
fighting and after suffering nearly 50%

1485
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,890
casualties at the hands
of a well prepared,

1486
01:36:36,891 --> 01:36:41,660
determined force of Nva soldiers of
force that finally estimated that was

1487
01:36:41,661 --> 01:36:45,530
finally estimated to be nearly 11,000
strong in her waist in the waist city area

1488
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:49,640
of operations.
On February 25th,

1489
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:54,640
1968 marines from Charlie company shot
off three e eight gas launchers caring

1490
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:58,980
about 40 cs gas grenades toward
the enemy's last known position.

1491
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:03,960
The next morning one five took control
of the remaining 12 city blocks and about

1492
01:37:03,961 --> 01:37:08,490
three hours without a single casualty
because the NBA was not equipped to deal

1493
01:37:08,491 --> 01:37:11,340
with tear gas attack and
was forced to withdraw.

1494
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:13,220
Okay,

1495
01:37:13,220 --> 01:37:16,160
so we're going from
50% casualties to zero.

1496
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:17,323
Hmm.

1497
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:26,560
Taking a different approach utilizing
weapons that no one was used to utilizing

1498
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:31,920
the enemy who's had never had not
seen they even have gas masks,

1499
01:37:31,921 --> 01:37:35,520
they just had to get out of there
and that he ate gas lock launcher.

1500
01:37:36,030 --> 01:37:40,560
It's like a suitcase looking thing and
it's got eight tubes that have eight

1501
01:37:40,561 --> 01:37:44,340
rounds at each in them and it
fires him like five seconds apart.

1502
01:37:44,341 --> 01:37:46,440
So we're talking a lot of gas.

1503
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:47,543
Hmm.

1504
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:52,670
Especially they shot off three of them.
You don't want none of that.

1505
01:37:55,180 --> 01:37:56,030
Yeah.
No

1506
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:58,400
one can never be certain that the use
of chemical weapons would have made a

1507
01:37:58,401 --> 01:38:00,230
difference in the initial
stages of the battle,

1508
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:04,460
but many of the veterans of that battle
have often wondered what might've

1509
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,810
happened if the [inaudible]
had been deployed in the
early stages of the battle.

1510
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:11,410
We recommend the judicious use of
chemical weapons such as tear gas,

1511
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:13,600
etc. For combat operations.

1512
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:15,960
Okay.

1513
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:17,760
Administration planning and preparation.

1514
01:38:17,761 --> 01:38:21,480
The inherent complexities of urban combat
are such that special attention needs

1515
01:38:21,481 --> 01:38:25,800
to be paid toward planning and
preparations. Training, training,

1516
01:38:25,890 --> 01:38:27,840
training practice makes perfect

1517
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:34,470
a coordinated marina tack on an enemy
held position at a town or city can be

1518
01:38:34,471 --> 01:38:37,950
equated to an intricate
opera or Broadway production,

1519
01:38:37,951 --> 01:38:40,260
although the stakes are a bit higher.

1520
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:42,510
Okay.

1521
01:38:42,510 --> 01:38:45,180
Entry techniques,
room search and clearing techniques.

1522
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:48,270
Voice commands indicating movement
or progress, fire discipline,

1523
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:51,210
the use of grenades, rockets,
supporting fires, communications.

1524
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:56,390
All of these must be rehearsed and
improved until they are second nature.

1525
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:04,890
Second Nature.
I was talking to you the other day,

1526
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,680
you were saying something about
my guillotine choke. Yeah.

1527
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:15,960
That it was there quickly. Yes. Yeah,

1528
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,300
and I was saying it's second.
It's,

1529
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:23,250
I should have said it's second nature
because what I did tell you is sometimes I

1530
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:26,580
become aware like we'll be rolling
and all of a sudden I'll be like, oh,

1531
01:39:26,581 --> 01:39:29,960
I've got a guillotine right now.
Yeah. I didn't even does this way.

1532
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:34,220
It just showed up there with zero
fought whatsoever. Yeah, yeah.

1533
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:36,070
That's how you need to be.
Yeah.

1534
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:40,470
If I have to think about
putting a guillotine on someone,

1535
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:43,360
then that means they have time to
think about defending the right. Yeah.

1536
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,920
If I didn't even think about it and
it just happened to Sorta, yeah,

1537
01:39:46,950 --> 01:39:51,090
and not to split hairs. It's less
about the gay teens specifically.

1538
01:39:51,091 --> 01:39:54,690
It's just about your like what do you
call it? Head control, you know? You know,

1539
01:39:54,691 --> 01:39:58,920
you get that Chin Strap, oh, it's that
we're, that just arrives and then sure.

1540
01:39:58,921 --> 01:40:00,480
It will become a good team for sure.

1541
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:04,590
We're a cobra or one of these other
treacherous moves that you'd like to

1542
01:40:04,591 --> 01:40:09,570
implement it from time to time.
Yeah. But yeah, it's like your head.

1543
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,890
Well,
I feel like,

1544
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:14,640
I feel like it's second nature
for my head to just land in there.

1545
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:19,260
That's what it feels like
for sure. But obviously it's
you, it's your thing. Oh no,

1546
01:40:20,190 --> 01:40:22,890
but that's the way we want to trade.
That's the way we're going to train it.

1547
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:26,340
And I would say,
I'll add to this,

1548
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,370
that what we want to train is
we want to train for chaos.

1549
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:30,570
We want to train from mayhem.

1550
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,300
We want to train for the enemy
to do things we're not expecting.

1551
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:34,530
That's what we want to train for.

1552
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:37,280
Because when you train for
things at the enemy's not you,

1553
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:40,830
that you're not expecting the enemy, do
you actually get good at reacting to it?

1554
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:44,370
You know, you can get good at
scrambling in Jiu Jitsu. Yeah.

1555
01:40:45,120 --> 01:40:50,120
You can get good at ending up in
positions that are beneficial through no

1556
01:40:51,511 --> 01:40:53,980
conscious thought. But because
you've scrambled enough that now you

1557
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:55,360
just know what you're looking for.
These little,

1558
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:57,520
these little things are gonna happen.
I'm gonna get the under hook.

1559
01:40:57,521 --> 01:41:00,160
I'm gonna get my hips in the right spot.
I'm gonna move my hand over here. Yeah,

1560
01:41:00,340 --> 01:41:03,460
that's what we want to do.
Yeah. Yeah. Like the old,

1561
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:09,090
almost cliched saying to like get
comfortable being uncomfortable.

1562
01:41:09,390 --> 01:41:10,600
The thing you know, it's like, yeah,

1563
01:41:10,601 --> 01:41:14,710
you train yourself to be uncomfortable
or to be trained in being uncomfortable.

1564
01:41:14,711 --> 01:41:17,230
You can just deal better.
But I'm trying to get something,

1565
01:41:17,320 --> 01:41:20,470
I'm trying to reach a different
point here. My point is this,

1566
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,920
if I,
let's say,

1567
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,860
let's say here's,

1568
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,660
there's a through z situations I can
put you in and they're all different.

1569
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:36,220
If I train you for a and B all the time,

1570
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:39,670
when I throwed Fmu, you're, you're lost.

1571
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:44,500
If I throw Q at You, you're, you're lost.

1572
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,780
If I train you,
so I get you good at a B.

1573
01:41:48,781 --> 01:41:52,510
But then I start training you at Dsr
drone, u, N, F I start throwing you at m.

1574
01:41:53,710 --> 01:41:58,570
You will start to realize that
even in these disparate scenarios,

1575
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:03,790
there are some commonalities and there
are some base positions that you can go

1576
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:08,791
to that will allow you the time
to assess and make decisions.

1577
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:15,280
You can,
you can get good at chaos.

1578
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:19,480
That's what I'm saying. You
can get good at chaos. Yeah,

1579
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:24,490
yeah. You can get good
at it. You can say, oh,

1580
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:28,960
when I see things happening that I don't
understand, here's what I need to do.

1581
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:31,780
I need to find a good covered position.

1582
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:34,540
Hopefully elevated
where I can look around.

1583
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:39,310
I need to figure out where my troops are.
I need to do it very quickly.

1584
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:44,700
I need to identify a prominent terrain
feature that I can move all of us to in a

1585
01:42:46,391 --> 01:42:51,370
rapid manner so that I can get
controlled situation right there. Now,

1586
01:42:51,371 --> 01:42:53,920
with those things that I just said,
hey,

1587
01:42:53,921 --> 01:42:56,880
I'm going to get in a position where I
can look around, I'm going to look for,

1588
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,320
I'm going to try and figure out where
my people are going to look for a

1589
01:42:59,321 --> 01:43:02,740
prominent terrain feature that
I can utilize as a stronghold.

1590
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:07,720
Guess what I just solved for just about
any scenario that unfolds that I don't

1591
01:43:07,721 --> 01:43:09,820
understand.
I have a plan.

1592
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:14,740
I have a plan that I can actually
implement against any situation.

1593
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,360
Think about that, so, oh,
if I get a contact front,

1594
01:43:19,390 --> 01:43:22,510
I have a plan or we started
getting cog shot up from the front.

1595
01:43:22,511 --> 01:43:26,980
I weren't in an open ground. I have a
plan. It's a standard operating procedure.

1596
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:31,810
Oh, I start getting shot at from the
front and we're in enclosed terrain.

1597
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:34,990
I have a plant.
There's a specific immediate action drill.

1598
01:43:34,991 --> 01:43:38,860
We're going to perform a, wait
a second. I'm getting shot at.

1599
01:43:38,920 --> 01:43:41,710
I'm not sure where it is.
I hear screaming.

1600
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:46,090
I know that we're getting hit from
multiple locations. What do I need to do?

1601
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:49,330
I have an immediate action for that too.
I'm going to find cover.

1602
01:43:49,450 --> 01:43:50,620
I'm going to look around.

1603
01:43:50,710 --> 01:43:54,020
I'm going to and figure out where my
troops are and to look for a prominent

1604
01:43:54,021 --> 01:43:58,250
terrain feature that we can
move towards. Yeah. There.

1605
01:43:59,150 --> 01:44:01,910
Now all of a sudden the chaos
isn't really chaos. Right now.

1606
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:06,911
All of a sudden I have a plan and I can
actually apply that plan to almost any

1607
01:44:07,161 --> 01:44:08,390
scenario.
Yeah.

1608
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:13,820
So the more that you train people for
things that they don't expect and don't

1609
01:44:13,821 --> 01:44:17,220
understand, the better they will get
it. Dealing with those things. Yeah.

1610
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:19,230
And that's very positive.
Yeah.

1611
01:44:22,780 --> 01:44:26,890
Moving on
further,

1612
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:32,190
all plans must be communicated
and rehearsed at each
level of command from the

1613
01:44:32,561 --> 01:44:34,870
fire team to the company and above.

1614
01:44:36,190 --> 01:44:40,060
It sounds like these guys did not have
good decentralized command in terms of

1615
01:44:40,061 --> 01:44:42,070
actually knowing what
the overall plan was.

1616
01:44:42,071 --> 01:44:43,930
Cause it sounds like the
fire teams were there,

1617
01:44:43,960 --> 01:44:48,880
even a platoon and fire team levels
were a little bit lost at points in

1618
01:44:48,881 --> 01:44:50,020
particular platoon commanders,

1619
01:44:50,021 --> 01:44:53,680
platoon sergeants and squad leaders and
fire team leaders must be aware of each

1620
01:44:53,681 --> 01:44:57,430
man's assignment. This should include
who goes into a structure first,

1621
01:44:57,490 --> 01:44:59,770
who covers cover and move

1622
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:05,450
nowadays.
Cause we've done it in the U s military,

1623
01:45:05,451 --> 01:45:08,250
we've done so much urban
combat in the last,

1624
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:10,740
what has it been 17 years.

1625
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:14,910
Every military unit in the u s military,

1626
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:20,270
they can take down a structure and
they do it well and they do it off of

1627
01:45:20,941 --> 01:45:24,750
standard operating procedures, not off
of a specific plan of who goes where.

1628
01:45:25,240 --> 01:45:26,073
Okay.

1629
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:31,650
Continue on hand and arm signals as well
as vocal commands should be established

1630
01:45:31,710 --> 01:45:33,060
and practiced

1631
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:40,410
and the last section is
called command and control

1632
01:45:42,660 --> 01:45:44,910
in full scale urban conflict,

1633
01:45:44,911 --> 01:45:48,510
especially in situations where enemy
dispositions are not well known.

1634
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:53,540
Initial contact with the enemy can be a
unexpected to be at very close range and

1635
01:45:53,761 --> 01:45:58,560
see massively devastating
command and control.

1636
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:03,030
The basic marines connection
to his leadership can
disappear in the blink of an

1637
01:46:03,031 --> 01:46:04,880
eye during operation way.

1638
01:46:04,881 --> 01:46:09,881
City Charlie one five lost all of its
officers except for two sergeants became

1639
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:15,570
platoon commanders.
Pfcs were squad leaders

1640
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:18,300
in urban combat.

1641
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:22,140
It would not be at all surprising to
find Pfcs as platoon commanders given the

1642
01:46:22,141 --> 01:46:24,420
potentially high casualty rates.

1643
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:29,910
The critical factor for Unit survival in
these situations is that units ability

1644
01:46:29,911 --> 01:46:34,911
to immediately determine the enemy's
position and to return a high volume of

1645
01:46:35,311 --> 01:46:37,650
sustained fire on those positions.

1646
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:42,920
Allowing maneuverability
despite the situation with
the chain of command who two

1647
01:46:43,890 --> 01:46:47,910
critical things there cover and move
as one and decentralized command is to,

1648
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,250
that's what they're talking about.

1649
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:55,140
You need to be able to put down high
a heavy volume of sustained fire on

1650
01:46:55,141 --> 01:46:57,380
positions so that you can maneuver and,

1651
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:00,990
and at the same time you need to be able
to do that regardless of the situation

1652
01:47:00,991 --> 01:47:02,910
with the chain of command.
Decentralized Command.

1653
01:47:03,130 --> 01:47:03,963
Hm.

1654
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:11,530
During the first day of one fives
involvement in operation waste,

1655
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:13,930
city Alpha company lost its CEO.

1656
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:18,970
It's Xo and much of the
company CP Group of necessity.

1657
01:47:18,971 --> 01:47:22,030
Alpha was pulled back to the
battalion rear for reorganization.

1658
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:26,560
The loss of a few leaders effectively
eliminated an entire company.

1659
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:31,060
This also delayed the battalion's attack,
blunting our initiatives.

1660
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:36,190
You've got to have a plan.
If people go down who's taken over,

1661
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:38,800
that's gotta be,
that's gotta be ready.

1662
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:47,560
The individual marine who is under heavy
enemy fire from very close range who

1663
01:47:47,561 --> 01:47:51,940
may now be caught off from his team
and or squad leader needs to have been

1664
01:47:51,941 --> 01:47:55,600
thoroughly informed of communications
codes, lines of departures,

1665
01:47:55,601 --> 01:47:57,880
lines of stoppage,
friendly unit dispositions,

1666
01:47:57,881 --> 01:48:01,370
and the ability to call and supporting
fires and conduct contingency plans.

1667
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:07,770
What does that mean? That means the troops
need to understand what is happening

1668
01:48:09,480 --> 01:48:12,630
in short in urban conflict situations.

1669
01:48:12,930 --> 01:48:17,430
Command and control needs to be understood
at every level down to the basic

1670
01:48:17,431 --> 01:48:22,250
marine. Based on our experiences
during operation way,

1671
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:25,810
city expect the unexpected,

1672
01:48:26,410 --> 01:48:30,760
expect chaos and plan
for all possibilities.

1673
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:32,890
And it's signed Scott Nelson,

1674
01:48:32,891 --> 01:48:37,891
first lieutenant commanding
officer Charlie one five Nick War,

1675
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:42,790
Second Lieutenant Platoon Commander
Charlie one five Travis Curd,

1676
01:48:42,791 --> 01:48:44,830
second lieutenant artillery.

1677
01:48:44,831 --> 01:48:48,460
Forward Observer attached to
Charlie one five and John Mullen,

1678
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:52,930
Staff Sergeant Platoon
Sergeant Charlie one five

1679
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:59,020
nick war is his name. W a R. R. Hmm.

1680
01:49:02,570 --> 01:49:06,470
Pretty stoked to be born with that
war was, he's in the Marine Corps.

1681
01:49:06,471 --> 01:49:10,680
What's your name? My
name is actually or yeah.

1682
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:14,470
So, uh, yeah. And,

1683
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:18,940
and to hear from these guys and,
and this is this,

1684
01:49:18,941 --> 01:49:20,800
this document which is now,

1685
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:25,270
well it's 50 years old,
1968

1686
01:49:26,770 --> 01:49:31,770
and there's still lessons learned in
this that apply to really apply to

1687
01:49:32,711 --> 01:49:36,790
everything, apply to life,
a blighted urban combat,

1688
01:49:36,850 --> 01:49:41,190
apply to business, apply to leadership. So

1689
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:43,471
there you have it.

1690
01:49:43,471 --> 01:49:48,471
And of course when we see the way
broadly we can recognize it more,

1691
01:49:50,020 --> 01:49:55,020
we can see it in more things and it makes
us more effective leaders regardless

1692
01:49:56,171 --> 01:49:57,280
of the battlefield that we're on.

1693
01:49:59,440 --> 01:50:04,440
So read and appreciate the
lessons of the past and echo.

1694
01:50:06,610 --> 01:50:11,260
Speaking of the way,
I know,

1695
01:50:11,440 --> 01:50:14,950
I know Jujitsu is sort of beneficial,

1696
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:20,230
sort of helpful in allowing
us to understand the way
more clearly and perhaps

1697
01:50:21,101 --> 01:50:21,970
even more broadly,

1698
01:50:22,510 --> 01:50:25,020
I don't know if you have any
recommendations of how we could sort of

1699
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,710
get in the game and stay in the game.

1700
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:33,080
It's funny you mentioned Jitsu is like
a way to recognize things like it's so

1701
01:50:36,330 --> 01:50:41,020
it's such a metaphor even to use the word
metaphor seems like it's like detailed

1702
01:50:41,070 --> 01:50:43,470
like it is life in so many ways.
Like all,

1703
01:50:43,471 --> 01:50:47,370
even this thing that I'm listening
to you read, I'm like, oh yeah.

1704
01:50:47,371 --> 01:50:50,940
Did you do every single one? I just
don't want to bore everyone with, okay.

1705
01:50:50,941 --> 01:50:52,050
More Jujitsu stuff

1706
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:55,540
on the judo podcasts that we did,

1707
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:59,380
I was talking about the fact that I,

1708
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:05,130
I have to give credit some credit to
Jujitsu for sort of revealing to me the

1709
01:51:05,771 --> 01:51:10,280
thread that tied all these things
together was JP was in town. Sure.

1710
01:51:11,050 --> 01:51:15,940
And we were rolling Jujitsu
yesterday and I was thinking as like,

1711
01:51:15,941 --> 01:51:20,680
well actually when we were done, I was
thinking, man, when we were in Ramadi

1712
01:51:22,210 --> 01:51:25,960
12 years ago,
I was a black belt in Jujitsu.

1713
01:51:26,370 --> 01:51:30,630
Like I like, it was beneficial for me
then to a bit of black belt in Jujitsu.

1714
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:34,420
Not because I wasn't going out
and grappling against the enemy,

1715
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:39,940
but I had already started to
connect some of these dots.

1716
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:44,890
Yeah. And it's very, very helpful in life.

1717
01:51:46,180 --> 01:51:51,180
It's also helpful because it is a physical
representation that you can feel and

1718
01:51:56,801 --> 01:52:01,060
you can see. Yeah. It's
not a theory. Yeah.

1719
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:04,660
There's theory behind it, but it's
not a theory. It's happening to you.

1720
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,840
And therefore when it happens to you,
you have something physical,

1721
01:52:07,841 --> 01:52:12,460
something concrete, something that you
actually experienced on a physical level.

1722
01:52:13,240 --> 01:52:13,780
And if you,

1723
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:18,460
and that allows you to understand
it metaphorically better.

1724
01:52:20,130 --> 01:52:23,320
Yeah.
Like when you get caught,

1725
01:52:23,440 --> 01:52:25,520
when someone's trying to choke you
and then Bolton, they arm lock you,

1726
01:52:25,650 --> 01:52:30,470
you've just got flanked. Yes.
That just happened to you.
It's not metaphorical. You,

1727
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:35,380
you truly understand what it
feels like to get flanked.

1728
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:39,190
Yes. If I explain to you, hey, when
I'm telling you this thing over here,

1729
01:52:39,191 --> 01:52:42,320
and then I come at you from another
angle, you understand it. You're, you're,

1730
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:45,370
you're just starting to grasp,
grasp of the concept,

1731
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,060
but it didn't happen to you.

1732
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:52,550
But when I'm trying to choke you and
you go for the defense and then boom,

1733
01:52:52,580 --> 01:52:56,570
you get arm locked and you didn't see
it coming at all, you feel a flank,

1734
01:52:56,571 --> 01:53:00,500
you feel the effectiveness of
it in real time, in real time.

1735
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:06,130
And that's why it's very beneficial
to train some of that Jujitsu feel

1736
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:12,920
experience,
the laws of combat field.

1737
01:53:13,530 --> 01:53:16,310
Yeah. You, you'll have a better
comprehension of them. Yeah.

1738
01:53:17,450 --> 01:53:21,240
And that's like a profound level too.
Like that's like a,

1739
01:53:22,460 --> 01:53:23,150
that's good.

1740
01:53:23,150 --> 01:53:26,300
If you can keep that in mind and then
you can go on the other side of the

1741
01:53:26,301 --> 01:53:28,070
spectrum where it's like,

1742
01:53:28,820 --> 01:53:32,090
it's you just fighting with your
friends with no consequence. You know,

1743
01:53:32,390 --> 01:53:36,830
where I think a lot of the time, what does
that mean? Like if mean if you go, hey,

1744
01:53:36,831 --> 01:53:39,950
let's go train right now what we're
going to do when you say, let's go train.

1745
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:44,270
Sure, we might go over some toe. Oh, we're
fighting. But without real consequence,

1746
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:47,830
we don't lose friendship. We don't get
injured. Uh, we don't get, you know,

1747
01:53:47,850 --> 01:53:51,440
rest of all that stuff that, but we
get to like fight, you know, I don't,

1748
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:56,600
that's also good. Yeah. So in, here's
the thing, like, here's a thing,

1749
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,410
like some people in,
I think we,

1750
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:04,160
most people like we'd like fighting,

1751
01:54:04,190 --> 01:54:08,510
but we don't want to like fight people.
Like, I don't want to fight everyone,

1752
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:13,390
you know? Well, because then you
can get arrested. Well, sure.

1753
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,410
Most people,
like I said,

1754
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:19,010
we don't want just fight because there's
all kinds of different reasons or

1755
01:54:19,011 --> 01:54:23,150
whatever. But when you can, just,
when you have the opportunity to,

1756
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:28,250
to fight someone with no consequence,
just to see how it would go. You know,

1757
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:32,700
like if he's, you know, these
huge, huge men, you know,

1758
01:54:32,701 --> 01:54:34,790
the guys who were like seven feet tall,
400 pound,

1759
01:54:34,791 --> 01:54:36,650
just huge and strong
man and stuff like that.

1760
01:54:37,490 --> 01:54:40,820
You don't want to necessarily fight them,
but you're like, I wonder, I wonder,

1761
01:54:40,821 --> 01:54:43,730
I lucked. That would be like roll
with them to fight with that guy.

1762
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:46,430
You know when you do Jujitsu,
you get that,

1763
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:48,950
you get that opportunity straight
up and you want to, you want to try,

1764
01:54:48,951 --> 01:54:51,620
if I eat this, I wonder how
many people out there wondering,

1765
01:54:51,621 --> 01:54:54,710
I wonder would it be to fight
Jocko to say I would beat him up.

1766
01:54:54,711 --> 01:54:55,610
Not to say I wouldn't,

1767
01:54:55,611 --> 01:55:00,200
but I wonder how it would be that it's a
lot of people show up at the gym and Oh,

1768
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:02,460
and that's exactly why.
And that's one point.

1769
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:05,500
The funny thing is it doesn't matter if
they're white belts or black belts. Yeah.

1770
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:10,100
They still like, yeah. See what up,
see how that experience is, you know,

1771
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:14,870
they usually smiling. Yeah, fully. And
really when it comes down to it, I mean,

1772
01:55:14,871 --> 01:55:16,610
unless you're trying to hurt someone,
you know,

1773
01:55:16,611 --> 01:55:19,610
and there's a bunch of different ways
to hurt someone if you want to hurt them

1774
01:55:19,611 --> 01:55:21,440
because they don't like gum
or you think they should,

1775
01:55:21,441 --> 01:55:23,750
you know they deserve it or all
this stuff. It's not about that.

1776
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:27,260
It can be about that for sure.
But that's not ultimately what it is.

1777
01:55:27,261 --> 01:55:29,240
It's more about like I wonder,

1778
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:32,510
I wonder how it beat a fight that person.

1779
01:55:32,570 --> 01:55:36,380
And then when you start to learn
more and more and more, you just,

1780
01:55:36,381 --> 01:55:38,480
you really just enjoy that activity.

1781
01:55:38,481 --> 01:55:40,550
Like quite get to fight like
right now if I wanted to,

1782
01:55:40,551 --> 01:55:44,280
if you had the time or whatever, I mean
you, we could go, we could go right now.

1783
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:48,510
Yeah. And it'd be like in a good
safe way to wrap this up then.

1784
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:55,590
But you see what I'm saying? No, that's
the way to do it anyway. Okay. All right.

1785
01:55:55,591 --> 01:55:59,310
Back to the path. That's
the path. Inappropriate part
of the path. By the way,

1786
01:56:00,840 --> 01:56:02,910
you wouldn't be you without Jujitsu?
I wouldn't,

1787
01:56:02,940 --> 01:56:05,700
you wouldn't even be like happening.
Especially if you knew

1788
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:10,920
I wouldn't be happy at all.
Yeah. Especially if I knew.

1789
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:12,720
But on top of that,

1790
01:56:13,260 --> 01:56:18,260
I wouldn't have connected things that I,

1791
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:22,350
that Jujitsu connected for me.
Yeah. There's something else.

1792
01:56:23,820 --> 01:56:28,260
I would not be who I am.

1793
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:32,970
I'm going to straight up say yes. I would
not be who I am without Jujitsu. Yeah.

1794
01:56:33,330 --> 01:56:37,110
And you wouldn't be who? You would not
be on this podcast without Jujitsu. No,

1795
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,160
I couldn't even talk to you.

1796
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:42,540
I believe it's a stretch anyway.
It's a stretch anyway,

1797
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:44,450
but when I'll do too,
I'll be at least there.

1798
01:56:44,451 --> 01:56:48,200
So without that would be talking
about TV shows and I'd be like,

1799
01:56:49,070 --> 01:56:53,360
I'd be like muting your
microphone or something. Let's
see. So did you get to, hey,

1800
01:56:53,361 --> 01:56:56,900
it's a lifesaver. Get you into
all kinds of different things,

1801
01:56:58,010 --> 01:57:02,420
but even if you're trying
to stay on the path, okay,

1802
01:57:02,570 --> 01:57:05,330
I'm dragging it. I dig it, man.
But it's important when you're,

1803
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:07,970
when you're trying to get on the path,
stay on the path,

1804
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,550
be beat on the path.

1805
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:15,470
It's only fitting for real. It's
only fitting. Okay. Let's say, okay,

1806
01:57:15,471 --> 01:57:18,350
let's say you have weapons training suite.

1807
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:23,240
Let's say you can drive a car really
well. Cool. You can hunt, you can,

1808
01:57:23,241 --> 01:57:25,900
you're capable, you can, you
know all this stuff, right?

1809
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:32,240
But if you're stripped
away of like your tools,

1810
01:57:32,400 --> 01:57:37,400
oh then one man on man. Yeah.
Just don't have the Jujitsu.

1811
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:41,360
Yeah. And this is more of just a
real general way to look at it.

1812
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:46,550
So it's like you ever
watch men in black one?

1813
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:51,020
I can't really remember too much about it.
This might not even be the movie,

1814
01:57:51,021 --> 01:57:55,070
but it's, it's a movie with one of the,
it's like this big rope creature, right?

1815
01:57:55,071 --> 01:57:56,630
And then they find out it's just a suit.

1816
01:57:56,631 --> 01:58:00,420
And in the inside there's just this
little worm type person thing, you know,

1817
01:58:01,550 --> 01:58:04,150
they're kind of, you know, oh, so
you're saying if I didn't do Jujitsu,

1818
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:05,360
I would just be like a little worm,

1819
01:58:07,070 --> 01:58:10,400
big strong guy or whatever.

1820
01:58:10,401 --> 01:58:12,950
But then like if all your
tools were taken away,

1821
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:15,340
what are you left with kind of thing.
Isn't it weird when you, when you

1822
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:20,020
meet people that are that like they don't,
they're like big.

1823
01:58:20,180 --> 01:58:24,690
Yeah. Maybe even their strong,
maybe even their aggressive. Yeah,

1824
01:58:25,090 --> 01:58:28,810
but they, they don't have, they don't
have a skill. They don't have the skill.

1825
01:58:28,920 --> 01:58:31,550
Right. That's kind of a bummer.
That's essentially, here's this,

1826
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:34,000
here's the situation that people
might be listening and think, okay,

1827
01:58:34,001 --> 01:58:36,550
well let's say you're in the situation
where you don't have the skill.

1828
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,280
You have two options.
Option one is the easy path,

1829
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:45,990
which is I'm just never going to get
that skill. Never to go near Jujitsu.

1830
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,790
I'm never going to get in a confrontation
with anybody because I don't want to

1831
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:53,820
be proven to myself that
I'm a warm inside of a suit

1832
01:58:56,770 --> 01:58:58,960
or you can take the hard path,
which is,

1833
01:58:59,020 --> 01:59:02,440
even though I'm 37 years old,

1834
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:08,500
I'm bummed that I missed out on the
bar. You know, I took me awhile,

1835
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:10,160
but you know what? I'm going
to go figure this out. Yeah.

1836
01:59:10,270 --> 01:59:12,430
I'm going to go at least learn some of it.

1837
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:14,560
I'm going to at least learn some of it.

1838
01:59:15,430 --> 01:59:19,720
I would take that even though I
know it's hard because people,

1839
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:22,570
you know when you're, when you get older
you don't want to try something new.

1840
01:59:23,260 --> 01:59:28,260
Even though it's proven that learning
something new is completely beneficial for

1841
01:59:29,381 --> 01:59:33,640
your mental and physical health.
Yeah.

1842
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:35,760
And ice and yeah,

1843
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:40,720
it's not all like
pleasurable roses and stuff.

1844
01:59:40,760 --> 01:59:43,880
I don't know. Did you know there's
some, there's some struggle in there,

1845
01:59:44,180 --> 01:59:49,000
but tell me about it. There's
there, there's dean lister. I was,

1846
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:52,480
I was in turtle position.
Dean lister is shoulders healing back up.

1847
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,960
I was internal position mount and side
control for 22 minutes the other day.

1848
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,620
And that's a struggle.

1849
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:04,330
And also he was pushing my
face into the mat and saying,

1850
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:09,030
what color is the mat?
See?

1851
02:00:09,330 --> 02:00:13,180
Like as you see what I'm saying, well
what does that fun? The answer's no, no.

1852
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:16,580
That's high level struggle because
the typical person you go into,

1853
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:18,470
that's not gonna happen to you.
So that's,

1854
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:22,870
that's like the struggle that's going
to get someone that has a personal

1855
02:00:23,350 --> 02:00:27,030
vendetta on your existence that
Dean has on mine. Yeah. Yeah.

1856
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:31,480
I think it was a CD called kill Jocko
does indeed. Factually. Nonetheless.

1857
02:00:31,481 --> 02:00:33,700
All right. There's going to be
some struggle in there. You get it,

1858
02:00:33,701 --> 02:00:36,430
but you jump in there just like
everything. When you learn golf,

1859
02:00:36,431 --> 02:00:39,880
there's gonna be a struggle. No, you're
going to miss that hole sometimes,

1860
02:00:40,120 --> 02:00:42,160
but I know it's a
different kind of struggle,

1861
02:00:42,690 --> 02:00:47,090
but on a fundamental level it's
all the same struggle here.

1862
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:48,610
Nonetheless,

1863
02:00:48,610 --> 02:00:51,580
you're going to need a g and when you
get your g you're going to go to origin

1864
02:00:51,581 --> 02:00:53,110
main.com get an origin gets.

1865
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:58,110
It's the best kind of made in America
from the cotton grown in America loomed or

1866
02:00:58,241 --> 02:01:02,920
we've woven for woven in America,
assembled, sewn, stitched,

1867
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:07,930
presented,
enjoyed in utilize,

1868
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:11,310
utilize in America in America actually
can be utilized where for but none the

1869
02:01:11,311 --> 02:01:15,370
less, I mean in America and they
are factually, no, not my opinion.

1870
02:01:15,371 --> 02:01:17,790
Sounds like an opinion,
but it's factually there.

1871
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:21,430
Factually the best firm in the world.
What's cool is

1872
02:01:23,360 --> 02:01:26,980
the geese are awesome,
but there's a problem.

1873
02:01:27,930 --> 02:01:30,910
It's a problem. The problem is you
can't wear a geek to the store,

1874
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:38,950
to the restaurant. No, not really. And yet
you were the origin pants and you think,

1875
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:42,800
man, I wouldn't mind, you
know, if they had a pocket I
would roll out. Right. Yeah.

1876
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:46,220
Especially if you get the black
ones, you know, like it's not,

1877
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:48,320
it's not crazy to think,
hey,

1878
02:01:48,321 --> 02:01:52,730
maybe I'll just kind of roll out to the
store or maybe go take my wife out for

1879
02:01:52,731 --> 02:01:54,040
dinner.
No,

1880
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:59,740
but that's okay because guess what
we got now denim or jeans dig it.

1881
02:02:00,770 --> 02:02:05,720
Yeah. Yeah. So those are common. Yeah.
Not quite out yet, but I got mine.

1882
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:09,800
Yeah. I don't have mine
and texting Pete, Bruh.

1883
02:02:10,660 --> 02:02:13,670
I don't want to buy and eat a pizza
and he's busy, man. He does a lot.

1884
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:14,770
And I don't want to,
I don't want to,

1885
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:19,940
my personal interests start to create
roadblocks or speed bumps and get this

1886
02:02:19,941 --> 02:02:24,200
whole thing, but I do want those
jeans though. That's a thing.

1887
02:02:24,201 --> 02:02:25,970
So I got to balance that.
A little dichotomy,

1888
02:02:25,971 --> 02:02:30,200
my personal interest in the
interest of Pete and his discourse.

1889
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:32,820
Nonetheless, I will
have them. We will have,

1890
02:02:32,870 --> 02:02:36,080
when did they come out then
in the process of coming out?

1891
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:39,200
Right now you have the material.

1892
02:02:39,620 --> 02:02:43,400
We are cutting the material now.
We're so in the material. Yeah.

1893
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:47,580
It's interesting cause I don't really get
excited about James or I don't get it,

1894
02:02:47,581 --> 02:02:49,940
like new genes coming
out or the new iPhone.

1895
02:02:50,060 --> 02:02:51,740
I don't get excited
about that kind of stuff.

1896
02:02:51,741 --> 02:02:53,810
But for some reason I'm
kinda excited about,

1897
02:02:54,240 --> 02:02:58,880
tell you why I'm a little bit
excited about it because of this.

1898
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,680
Jeans are American, right?
Genes represent America.

1899
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:08,090
Let's face it, if you wanted to
draw a stereotypical American human,

1900
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:12,200
they'd be wearing a pair of jeans. Here's
the problem. Jeans were made in America.

1901
02:03:12,201 --> 02:03:16,910
Jeans were invented in America.
Genes became famous in America.

1902
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:20,780
And then we sold our soul
and put them overseas.

1903
02:03:21,590 --> 02:03:25,040
Let them get manufactured overseas,
something that shouldn't have happened.

1904
02:03:25,730 --> 02:03:30,500
And so to bring it back to America,
does that feel good?

1905
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:35,270
Indeed? Yes, it does. It makes
sense. I dig it. So, yeah,

1906
02:03:35,570 --> 02:03:40,220
bring back in the soul. Um, other clothes,
their tee shirts and stuff from origin.

1907
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:44,570
If you can get, even if you don't want
jeans, you could get joggers right now.

1908
02:03:45,330 --> 02:03:49,910
Quick supplements to joint warfare,
Krill oil discipline, discipline,

1909
02:03:49,911 --> 02:03:52,610
go discipline go.

1910
02:03:53,210 --> 02:03:58,160
So when I work,
sometimes I have to work for two,

1911
02:03:58,250 --> 02:04:02,750
three straight hours
without any interruptions.

1912
02:04:03,180 --> 02:04:04,550
Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. You
see what I'm saying?

1913
02:04:05,180 --> 02:04:08,960
So I would be drinking discipline and all
of a sudden I'm an hour and 40 minutes

1914
02:04:08,961 --> 02:04:11,530
in. And guess what? I got to hit the
head. Well, the restroom break. Yeah.

1915
02:04:11,531 --> 02:04:16,160
So that's why we made discipline goal.
Just Morgan is just a, uh, a pill.

1916
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:21,230
Is that what it's called? A capsule and
it's got the, uh, got the goodness in it.

1917
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:26,440
And we also have coming the
discipline going to can you had drink?

1918
02:04:26,720 --> 02:04:29,040
Yeah. That's like if you had it yet. Yes.

1919
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:32,430
That's the one where like we were,
it was that,

1920
02:04:32,470 --> 02:04:34,760
did that give you one in New York
when we were in, did the New York,

1921
02:04:35,330 --> 02:04:39,440
I had one before that they sent
me. So yes. Good. I got it.

1922
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:44,190
I got more coming today.
Hopefully will be here, but um,

1923
02:04:44,250 --> 02:04:47,570
yeah, so that'd be common.
Of course we got Moeloek,

1924
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:52,680
which apparently doctor Luke hates
mint chocolate chip passionately.

1925
02:04:53,140 --> 02:04:54,870
And so when I heard him
going off the other day,

1926
02:04:54,871 --> 02:04:59,040
like why would you want anything that
tastes like toothpaste, toothpaste?

1927
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:01,950
So we have a little disagreement.
We'll have to settle that one on the mat,

1928
02:05:02,010 --> 02:05:05,550
but he's just going with peanut butter
vanilla grill or something. Good.

1929
02:05:05,820 --> 02:05:10,680
And don't forget about the war.
Your kid milk. No kidding. Yeah,

1930
02:05:12,090 --> 02:05:16,710
it tastes like strawberry.
Nestle's strawberry quick.
That's what it tastes like.

1931
02:05:17,100 --> 02:05:20,820
Can I say that? Is that legal? Yes.
Okay. Okay. Whether it's legal or not,

1932
02:05:20,910 --> 02:05:25,070
I can say I did say it and
it's tastes exactly like that.

1933
02:05:25,080 --> 02:05:28,800
I'm using that exactly like
it's strawberry, Nestle's Quik,

1934
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:30,840
but it has no sugar.

1935
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:35,880
It's got awesome protein and it
will make your kid into the next,

1936
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:41,520
you're about to say something
illegal right now. The next

1937
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:47,040
squared away athlete. There you go.
Smart. Yes. I was going to name names,

1938
02:05:47,041 --> 02:05:51,490
but I'm not going to name names, but
so that's what works in main.com. Yeah,

1939
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:53,340
that's a good officer.
They're all my people,

1940
02:05:53,670 --> 02:05:57,900
all my people up at origin that are
working every day, someone cutting,

1941
02:05:58,050 --> 02:05:59,490
stitching,
moving,

1942
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:04,500
shipping and make pretty much
getting after it big time. Also,

1943
02:06:04,501 --> 02:06:07,350
we have a store, it's called
Jocko store, you know,

1944
02:06:07,351 --> 02:06:12,180
stuff a little bit more formulated
for representing the path itself.

1945
02:06:12,230 --> 02:06:14,820
Um, you know, a little bit skewed,
but some good stuff on there.

1946
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:18,450
Some new stuff on there too by
the way. Oh really? Yeah, they uh,

1947
02:06:18,451 --> 02:06:22,060
the traveler travel mugs.
Okay. Kind of new. Good. Uh,

1948
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:26,640
I'm putting it hoodie up there,
but black on black. I like that.

1949
02:06:26,641 --> 02:06:31,450
It's subtle heavy. Okay. Is
it heavy? Is it legit? Heavy,

1950
02:06:31,500 --> 02:06:34,830
legit, heavy, legit. Like it's
the head. Is it the heaviest,

1951
02:06:34,860 --> 02:06:37,350
heaviest one in existence?
I'm sorry to say no,

1952
02:06:37,530 --> 02:06:41,460
but is there one that
you've ever made? Yes. It's,

1953
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:46,830
I want noticeably heavier to them than
the original black on black. All right.

1954
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:48,290
You got it.
Two of them nonetheless.

1955
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:51,810
Good stuff on their rash guards on
there too for Jujitsu for did you did to

1956
02:06:52,590 --> 02:06:55,260
representing the path big time on now.
And also

1957
02:06:56,910 --> 02:07:00,030
you can do other stuff with rash
guards as well. But, um, yeah,

1958
02:07:00,031 --> 02:07:04,590
some good stuff on there. If you want
to represent support, stay on the path.

1959
02:07:06,030 --> 02:07:07,590
That's where you go, Jocko. store.com.

1960
02:07:07,591 --> 02:07:10,800
Here's the thing about getting new
stuff too, and this is, this is,

1961
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:15,000
this is where six year old echo brain
comes out and there's a straight up,

1962
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:18,870
but it's still apply. It's still didn't,
if this dawns on me from time to time,

1963
02:07:18,871 --> 02:07:22,310
especially when it hits me, when
you get like a new thing, right?

1964
02:07:22,330 --> 02:07:25,470
I've talked about this before. When you
get a new rash guard, six years old bra,

1965
02:07:25,550 --> 02:07:27,750
you don't even act he life.
You know? And I think,

1966
02:07:27,810 --> 02:07:30,450
I think you think the same thing.
I think you feel the same way.

1967
02:07:30,451 --> 02:07:33,510
You won't necessarily admit it,
especially not to me, but I think you,

1968
02:07:33,820 --> 02:07:38,560
I think you feel the same way. Okay? If
you got a new thing of something that,

1969
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:42,310
that excites me to get new and um,
you keep doing what you're doing.

1970
02:07:42,311 --> 02:07:45,140
I'll think of something over here. We'll,
we'll think surfboard, think whatever.

1971
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:49,420
Nonetheless. There you go. So if you
get a new, a rash guard, a new gooey,

1972
02:07:50,110 --> 02:07:54,400
um, even new socks, sometimes
new shoes, new socks,

1973
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,670
1843,
I get the socks from audit from it,

1974
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:01,840
I get fired up nonetheless. You get
something new, get a rash guard.

1975
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:03,970
This is get after it.
If you don't have one already,

1976
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:07,960
you will be looking forward to
going to Jujitsu that much more.

1977
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:13,020
And that's the good thing about like
these things that represents the pounds.

1978
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:17,410
It's a hundred percent
correct. Try it. Try.

1979
02:08:17,710 --> 02:08:22,120
Actually I would say for anyone who has
like, you know, a shirt or whatever,

1980
02:08:22,121 --> 02:08:26,220
they felt it. Oh that's what I,
that's what I predict. No, I,

1981
02:08:26,370 --> 02:08:31,240
I understand what you're saying and
it actually is true when people,

1982
02:08:32,410 --> 02:08:33,640
when you get the,
you know,

1983
02:08:33,641 --> 02:08:37,960
that's the classic classic
scene from literature.

1984
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:43,040
Sure. When is the, I think it's like
the dawning of the uniform of the,

1985
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:47,190
of the warrior and they do it in movies
to the collage. They, you know, the,

1986
02:08:47,260 --> 02:08:50,650
the heroes putting his boots on and
then he's putting his web gear on.

1987
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:55,651
And even just when people
see the superheroes secret
thing opens up and all of

1988
02:08:56,751 --> 02:09:00,150
his gears in there, it is
all fired up. Like the vet,

1989
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:05,640
the old fet das go into that
chest in his or like in,

1990
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:09,100
in Mike and the dragons.
You know when he's opening,

1991
02:09:09,250 --> 02:09:11,920
opening up the chest filled with war gear.

1992
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:14,310
You know everyone got a little fired up.

1993
02:09:14,770 --> 02:09:19,360
Yeah cause they understand exactly right.
There we go. Same deal anyway Jocko,

1994
02:09:19,361 --> 02:09:21,790

1996
02:09:26,140 --> 02:09:30,550
She's something like grab

1997
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:32,410
We're still doing that.

1998
02:09:32,410 --> 02:09:34,960
I'm still doing that big time
because I was never a tea person.

1999
02:09:34,961 --> 02:09:36,160
And W I mean I'm saying that's,

2000
02:09:36,161 --> 02:09:39,790
that's saying something because I was
never a tea person. But guess what?

2001
02:09:39,791 --> 02:09:41,470
Look at me.
Tea person that will kind of,

2002
02:09:41,471 --> 02:09:46,280
I only drink this tea but
you know I'm into it. Jocko.
White tea person. Big Time.

2003
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:49,540
How's that deadlift? Huge. 8,100 pounds.

2004
02:09:49,660 --> 02:09:53,350
Actually I've been sticking with it.
Hey subscribe to the podcast.

2005
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:58,300
If you haven't iTunes,
Google, play, stitcher, leave
reviews. So I can read them.

2006
02:09:58,900 --> 02:10:02,430
Yeah, if you will. If you want. If
you don't want them, don't what?

2007
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:06,480
Also worry or kid podcasts,
subscribe to that.

2008
02:10:06,481 --> 02:10:10,510
While I was on a podcast yesterday and
they asked me to say subscribe to their

2009
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:14,110
podcast and I said, I don't even ask
people to subscribe to my podcast.

2010
02:10:14,111 --> 02:10:18,160
And I was like, well actually I
got to do and now I just did. Yeah,

2011
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:22,870
maybe it's actually you and I had this
discussion many times. I was like,

2012
02:10:22,871 --> 02:10:25,450
why do we need to cause you, you like
when people need to do to subscribe.

2013
02:10:25,451 --> 02:10:30,160
Maybe they haven't subscribed.
I mean, we're 162 podcast deep.

2014
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:34,430
That's gotta be four or
500 hours of listening.

2015
02:10:34,460 --> 02:10:36,730
You don't think someone hit subscribe yet.
Well I,

2016
02:10:36,731 --> 02:10:40,460
I agree with you fully so we can,
can we cut this out now? Yeah.

2017
02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:43,990
You wrote this by the way, but yeah,
of course we can. Well this is,

2018
02:10:44,330 --> 02:10:49,250
this is a carryover carryover.
Oh yes.

2019
02:10:49,251 --> 02:10:49,581
Look,

2020
02:10:49,581 --> 02:10:54,581
it's us doing what we talked about before
earlier today about doing things like,

2021
02:10:55,550 --> 02:10:59,040
because that's just how you know,
you gotta think. Got To think,

2022
02:10:59,510 --> 02:11:02,660
why do we want to waste five seconds
of someone's time telling him?

2023
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:05,960
It just sounds kind of like,
what is it like what do you call it?

2024
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:09,300
Redundant or something. It's kind
of like, um, do you think everyone,

2025
02:11:09,301 --> 02:11:14,301
who do you think anyone ever got to this
0.3 hours deep into the podcast and you

2026
02:11:14,961 --> 02:11:19,130
are, I said and subscribing and they
reached down to, they're like, oh my gosh.

2027
02:11:19,340 --> 02:11:22,690
Yeah. Oh shoot, I can do that. Hey,

2028
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:24,530
let me tell you what you might forget.

2029
02:11:24,531 --> 02:11:27,650
You might forget to subscribe
to the warrior kid podcast
because it's not coming

2030
02:11:27,651 --> 02:11:29,780
out quite as consistently at this time,

2031
02:11:29,870 --> 02:11:34,870
but it is a great podcast for you
or for your kids to listen to,

2032
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:40,310
to get them on the path. Yeah,
they can also, if you have kids,

2033
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:42,770
that's a good one. Oh, if you have
kids is definitely a good one.

2034
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:45,060
If you don't have kids,
it's not a bad one. Yeah,

2035
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:50,030
you can learn some real fundamental.
Those are lessons that you kind of forget.

2036
02:11:52,100 --> 02:11:55,220
That's what I think. I also get
to war kids soap, Irish oaks,

2037
02:11:55,221 --> 02:11:57,680
ranch.com got young aid and warrior kid

2038
02:12:00,470 --> 02:12:04,700
making soap. Yeah, just
having his own business. Yeah.

2039
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:07,760
Throw him some support.
Whatever. Irish oaks,

2040
02:12:07,761 --> 02:12:12,020
ranch.com real soap too by the way.
This like Ooh,

2041
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:17,390
kit on the line and put my
flavor in there and sell it.

2042
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:19,780
You can do that. Oh I didn't
know you could do that. How that,

2043
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:21,680
do you even know that I,
you know,

2044
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:26,090
get all kinds of weird
knowledge on the left.

2045
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:30,140
Don't forget about youtube and
that's where you can see echoes,

2046
02:12:30,170 --> 02:12:34,270
legit videos and when you
get done watching the video,
make sure you hit some.

2047
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:38,390
Nonetheless, we do have a youtube
channel. That's the point.

2048
02:12:38,391 --> 02:12:41,930
That is the point because you know if
you liked the video version or you didn't

2049
02:12:41,931 --> 02:12:45,860
know there was a video version, you can
leave comments there too. I read them,

2050
02:12:46,790 --> 02:12:50,960
I read youtube comments even though
Joe Rogan tells me not to. Yeah,

2051
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:51,900
cause you do.

2052
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:56,150
That's a slippery slope
because if a comment comes
and it like it say what's the

2053
02:12:56,151 --> 02:13:01,151
worst can comment is the kind that's
true or kind of true that like just like

2054
02:13:01,981 --> 02:13:04,760
are you were saying like it won't hit you.
It's not a hard punch.

2055
02:13:04,770 --> 02:13:05,780
It's a little indirect fire.

2056
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:09,650
It's an indirect fire but more effective
like you know in your neck or something.

2057
02:13:09,730 --> 02:13:13,280
It's like that. It has to be
a little bit true. I actually,

2058
02:13:13,281 --> 02:13:14,540
I think I've told you this before,

2059
02:13:14,541 --> 02:13:19,541
but I was one night I was reading youtube
comments to my oldest daughter about

2060
02:13:20,631 --> 02:13:24,320
me cause they were, and I forget it
was, it wasn't our podcast, it was,

2061
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:25,700
it was a different podcast,

2062
02:13:25,701 --> 02:13:29,260
a podcast that maybe people weren't as
much on board with the programs they had.

2063
02:13:29,260 --> 02:13:31,760
It's a lot of really colorful to see.
Yeah.

2064
02:13:32,870 --> 02:13:36,360
So I think just you,
Joe Rogan saying to you like,

2065
02:13:36,361 --> 02:13:39,570
don't read them and this is why he
doesn't like that. He just, you know,

2066
02:13:39,571 --> 02:13:42,600
he doesn't say it like, Hey,
hey Jocko. Don't know what
I'm saying. Like he's like,

2067
02:13:42,601 --> 02:13:45,690
oh you can't read the youtube comments
man. He'll say it like that. Yes.

2068
02:13:45,691 --> 02:13:46,471
And that's what I mean.

2069
02:13:46,471 --> 02:13:50,220
So you just knowing that allows
you to go in and know like, okay,

2070
02:13:50,221 --> 02:13:52,710
you can read them and you just got
to know that that's accessible.

2071
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,890
Most of them now in Jordan
Peterson like says he reads it,

2072
02:13:55,891 --> 02:14:00,150
but like they impact him. Yes. He
just, no, he didn't mean it. No, no.

2073
02:14:00,210 --> 02:14:02,850
Joe Rogan need to tell him that. You
got to tell them, hey, that's like,

2074
02:14:02,900 --> 02:14:05,280
that's not a normal comment
section is what I'm saying.

2075
02:14:05,281 --> 02:14:08,400
It's not like on Instagram where
it's like, hey, you know, it's like,

2076
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:12,330
it's just different. The dynamic, Bruh. I
used to make these videos, you know this,

2077
02:14:12,331 --> 02:14:16,830
but I used to make these videos like
parodies of like Darth Vader goes on dates

2078
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:20,910
and then I made this one. You put
those on my channel, on our channel,

2079
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:25,530
on your channel. People still watch
it. I mean they're funny. And Jeff Gla,

2080
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:29,690
but I made this one a
bikini light saber battle.

2081
02:14:31,510 --> 02:14:32,311
Gloria and them,

2082
02:14:32,311 --> 02:14:36,170
they're just fighting with light sabers
at the beach or whatever and well,

2083
02:14:36,171 --> 02:14:40,530
you know, you know people watch him. But
man, I look at the comments on that, man.

2084
02:14:40,531 --> 02:14:43,500
It's like people, I think someone
wanted me to die. He said,

2085
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:46,800
whoever made this should die, like
literally said that. I was like,

2086
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:51,440
what was the hating about it? What were
they hitting about it? It was dumb. Oh,

2087
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:54,600
okay. Which it is by the way.
Yeah, it's like two girls.

2088
02:14:54,600 --> 02:14:59,600
They're mad at something and then they
fight lightsaber and then like she wanted

2089
02:15:00,901 --> 02:15:05,220
the girl kills the other one and then
like Spiderman comes out is basically all

2090
02:15:05,221 --> 02:15:08,180
the props that I had at my house. I was
like, let me make a video, you know?

2091
02:15:09,240 --> 02:15:11,520
And so it was like, you
know, it was dumb for sure,

2092
02:15:11,521 --> 02:15:13,940
but probably you don't have to
say that Ken comments like that,

2093
02:15:13,941 --> 02:15:18,600
I got to die now because it's dumb.
Anyway, the point is, yeah, you gotta,

2094
02:15:18,601 --> 02:15:23,110
you gotta kind of know that that's
not a normal comments. Youtube there.

2095
02:15:23,670 --> 02:15:26,400
I get it. I get good entertainment
out of it. It's pretty fun.

2096
02:15:26,670 --> 02:15:30,600
Also got psychological warfare. That's on
iTunes, Google play, MP three platforms.

2097
02:15:30,601 --> 02:15:35,601
And that is a album with tracks about how
to overcome various stages of weakness

2098
02:15:35,881 --> 02:15:37,950
that you might occur that
might occur during your day.

2099
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:40,890
That's all we're going to say about that
one. That's good. That's very concise.

2100
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:46,200
It's Jocko though, by the way, on the
track. So that's something also on it.

2101
02:15:46,830 --> 02:15:50,970
On it.com/jocko this is where I
get all my kettle bells and socks.

2102
02:15:50,971 --> 02:15:51,751
Like I mentioned.

2103
02:15:51,751 --> 02:15:55,140
It seems odd like why you just get socks
from on it because they're freaking

2104
02:15:55,141 --> 02:15:58,800
dope. You ever watch the, he ever look
at the socks on on it or a freaking good?

2105
02:15:58,830 --> 02:16:03,570
Yeah, really good. You want to flex on?
The guys had her, I got all of them.

2106
02:16:03,630 --> 02:16:08,080
So weird flex but okay.
No.

2107
02:16:08,100 --> 02:16:12,840
When you want to flex at the, uh,
at the people at the Tsa I keep,

2108
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,390
I keep wanting to use
the term flex second.

2109
02:16:15,391 --> 02:16:20,160
That's modern way because my kids
use it and I keep wanting to use it.

2110
02:16:21,330 --> 02:16:24,150
Keep trying men. Yeah. I think
you're doing pretty good. But no,

2111
02:16:24,151 --> 02:16:26,430
I haven't really
appropriately used it yet.

2112
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:31,300
Will you used weird flex but
okay on to me. Not about me.

2113
02:16:31,301 --> 02:16:34,540
Like you were, you were saying
about someone else? Uh, no,

2114
02:16:34,541 --> 02:16:37,930
because Casey had a video that was
called that it was called weird flux,

2115
02:16:37,931 --> 02:16:40,540
but okay. And that's when I
realized it was a thing that,

2116
02:16:40,541 --> 02:16:44,320
that that's an actual thing.
Weird flex, but okay. No,

2117
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:48,910
you told me it was a thing that
I don't use it, I want to use it,

2118
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:53,100
but it's sort of a humble brag, right?
No, like weird flex. It's, yeah.

2119
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:56,110
It's like you're bragging about
something kind of weird to brag about,

2120
02:16:56,111 --> 02:16:59,730
but cool man, dude, do what you do
kind of thing. Oh, that's what the,

2121
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:04,150
that's what Casey's video was weird
flecks of what okay. Was about,

2122
02:17:04,151 --> 02:17:04,980
he was in,

2123
02:17:04,980 --> 02:17:08,710
he's in a movie and he was kind of like
flexing that he was in a movie and he

2124
02:17:08,711 --> 02:17:13,540
was like, but okay. Yeah, here's all
fired up. Yeah. It'd be more like, Hey,

2125
02:17:13,541 --> 02:17:18,260
like I can turn my eyelids inside out.
Okay.

2126
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:22,960
All right. We are flags because
flex was a little stronger.

2127
02:17:26,290 --> 02:17:29,140
You see what I'm saying?
Nonetheless on it.

2128
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:31,720
This is where you get your fitness stuff,
probably you,

2129
02:17:32,020 --> 02:17:35,230
you know how were we all have
home gyms? Most of us. Yeah.

2130
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:37,420
And you know you want a day,
you want some more kettle bells.

2131
02:17:37,450 --> 02:17:40,030
You want some jump ropes,
battle ropes, like stuff,

2132
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:43,630
more good stuff to keep you on the path,
keep you in shape.

2133
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:47,500
That's where you go on it. Dot. If
you want to get your mind in shape,

2134
02:17:47,830 --> 02:17:50,230
your brain in shape,
then you should read.

2135
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:52,870
If you want to read some
books that I wrote, then cool.

2136
02:17:53,890 --> 02:17:55,330
You can read Mikey and the dragons.

2137
02:17:55,780 --> 02:18:00,780
Best Children's book ever for children
under the age of six voted by me and you

2138
02:18:03,340 --> 02:18:07,660
and our children and our children.
Actually, someone asked my daughter,

2139
02:18:07,720 --> 02:18:12,040
my middle daughter the other day,
what's your favorite book of Your Dad's?

2140
02:18:12,100 --> 02:18:16,390
And she said, Mikey and the dragons.
Interesting. My daughter didn't,

2141
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:18,850
we didn't have any kind of official
like, oh, what's the best one?

2142
02:18:18,851 --> 02:18:23,851
But the one that she always reaches for
pushes for is where the warrior kid to

2143
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,830
months mission. She likes
marks mission. So there's that.

2144
02:18:26,831 --> 02:18:30,340
So there's Mike in the dragons. There's
way the warrior could to Mark's mission.

2145
02:18:30,640 --> 02:18:33,340
There's way the court warrior kid one,

2146
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:38,230
we're just called way of the warrior
kid soon to be way the warrior kid three

2147
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:39,340
writing is complete.

2148
02:18:39,520 --> 02:18:44,520
John Bozak is knee deep in the art right
now and that will be coming out in the

2149
02:18:45,220 --> 02:18:50,080
spring. I'm going to get it on Amazon
for preorder as early as I possibly can.

2150
02:18:50,081 --> 02:18:52,840
So we don't have another
scenario like we had with Mikey,

2151
02:18:52,841 --> 02:18:55,150
the dragons where we bought,

2152
02:18:55,210 --> 02:19:00,010
you all bought a lot of them
and I didn't have them on hand.

2153
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:02,790
Let's say I did give him everybody,
everybody by Christmas.

2154
02:19:02,800 --> 02:19:06,010
So look for that one way the warrior
kid three will be coming out.

2155
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:09,070
And then of course we got discipline
equal freedom field manual,

2156
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:13,780
which is awesome to
see that impact people.

2157
02:19:15,070 --> 02:19:19,120
And it's also a good gift
to give to people that maybe
need a little help. Yeah,

2158
02:19:19,240 --> 02:19:21,460
just kinda steer me the right direction.

2159
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:24,160
Extreme ownership and the
dichotomy of leadership.

2160
02:19:24,340 --> 02:19:28,520
Those are the leadership books that I
wrote with my brother Leif Babin and

2161
02:19:29,090 --> 02:19:34,090
they will help you with your organization
and in Your Business and in your life

2162
02:19:35,420 --> 02:19:39,260
lead.
And when also we got to echelon front,

2163
02:19:39,261 --> 02:19:43,340
which is my leadership consultancy.
It's me,

2164
02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:47,930
it's Leif Babin JP to know Dave Burke,
Flynn Cochran at Mike's Rally.

2165
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:51,720
Mike by Emma.
There's a picture of that echoes into

2166
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:56,900
the picture on the website.
Yeah man. But he's not,

2167
02:19:57,410 --> 02:20:00,440
he's not one of the
leadership instructors.

2168
02:20:00,470 --> 02:20:04,150
He is one of the leadership
instructor filmers.

2169
02:20:06,970 --> 02:20:10,340
Right? Uh Hey man, I'm on the
website. So that's really all.

2170
02:20:10,460 --> 02:20:13,820
So what we do is we solve
problems through leadership,

2171
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:15,560
go national in front.com for that.

2172
02:20:15,561 --> 02:20:19,340
We also have the monster coming up 2019
it's going to be May 23rd and 24th in

2173
02:20:19,341 --> 02:20:19,761
Chicago,

2174
02:20:19,761 --> 02:20:24,761
September 19th and 20th in Denver
and December 4th and fifth in Sydney,

2175
02:20:24,951 --> 02:20:27,470
Australia.
Check out a treme,

2176
02:20:27,471 --> 02:20:32,471
ownership.com they all have sold out
and this will solve a sell out as well.

2177
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:40,240
And when you go to that your going
to get granular explanations,

2178
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:46,330
multiple angles on how to work and apply
this stuff and if you can't come to

2179
02:20:46,701 --> 02:20:48,680
muster, guess what, you
can go somewhere else.

2180
02:20:48,681 --> 02:20:52,970
You can go to eff online.com
this is what we put together.

2181
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:56,210
It took us about nine months
to film put together design.

2182
02:20:56,450 --> 02:21:01,450
It's me and the rest of the Ashkelon
Front team training leadership through

2183
02:21:01,971 --> 02:21:05,210
technology and it's available for,

2184
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:08,630
we originally designed it for enterprise
for companies that we work with that

2185
02:21:08,631 --> 02:21:13,631
have 48,000 employees and we can't travel
the globe and train them all so we put

2186
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:20,171
this stuff online and it's also available
now direct to consumer [inaudible] dot

2187
02:21:22,041 --> 02:21:24,500

proven leaders from combat aviation

2189
02:21:30,261 --> 02:21:35,261
and from special operations and we're
plugging them into companies that need

2190
02:21:35,810 --> 02:21:39,380
leadership to win at their mission.

2191
02:21:39,830 --> 02:21:44,830
So giddy go to f overwatch.com if you
need that and if you want to pass on

2192
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:48,530
lessons learned to us,

2193
02:21:50,030 --> 02:21:54,440
we are kicking it on the interwebs,
on Twitter,

2194
02:21:55,100 --> 02:21:56,640
on Instagram and on Facebook.

2195
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:00,710
Echo is adequate.

2196
02:22:00,711 --> 02:22:05,711
Charles and I am at jockowillink and
of course thanks to all of our military

2197
02:22:06,561 --> 02:22:08,630
personnel around the world

2198
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:14,050
who stand their ground to protect us

2199
02:22:16,310 --> 02:22:20,300
and also thank you to our police and
law enforcement, the firefighters,

2200
02:22:20,420 --> 02:22:24,080
the paramedics and EMT,
the correctional officers,

2201
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:29,230
the folks on patrol in all the first
responders who stand their ground here at

2202
02:22:30,061 --> 02:22:31,440
home to protect us.

2203
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:33,753
Okay.

2204
02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:39,030
And everyone else.
I always say that time is short,

2205
02:22:42,840 --> 02:22:44,940
but most of us have more

2206
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:48,140
than six seconds.

2207
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:53,550
The six seconds that
Corporal Jonathan Yale

2208
02:22:55,130 --> 02:23:00,130
and Lance Corporal Jordan Herger had
to make the ultimate decision and the

2209
02:23:01,401 --> 02:23:05,780
ultimate sacrifice.
They could have had more time

2210
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:09,020
had they run away,

2211
02:23:11,730 --> 02:23:13,890
but they sacrificed it all.

2212
02:23:16,590 --> 02:23:17,423
Okay?

2213
02:23:17,690 --> 02:23:20,240
They gave up their time,
but we,

2214
02:23:20,330 --> 02:23:24,170
we still have time to
time they gave to us.

2215
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:26,570
Okay.

2216
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:31,440
So don't waste it.
Not six minutes of it,

2217
02:23:31,441 --> 02:23:34,980
not six seconds of it,
not one second of it.

2218
02:23:35,160 --> 02:23:39,120
None of it get out there
every second of every day.

2219
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:46,280
Get after it.
You're no till next time.

2220
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:48,770
This is echo and Jocko

2221
02:23:50,270 --> 02:23:50,590
out.
