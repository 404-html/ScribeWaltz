00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,600
This is Jocko podcast number
33 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,750
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,340
People say
there is a line,

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,130
there's a line between good and evil,

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,610
right and wrong between light

6
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
and dark.

7
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,550
And that's a nice clean
way to think of things.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,490
But the line can be hard to recognize.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,810
It can get blurry,

10
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:49,990
it can get twisted by emotion
and passion and by one's own ego,

11
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,520
they in war,
that line is tested,

12
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,830
it's pressed,
it becomes even more blurry.

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,120
It gets crossed and violated
and sometimes abandoned.

14
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,780
Or we can see that throughout history
and we've talked about it here in the

15
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:22,130
Japanese slave camps in Rwanda,
it me lie,

16
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,060
those are a few examples,
but there are thousands of them,

17
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,150
okay?

18
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,140
And obscene the line.

19
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,080
And I've seen men approach the line

20
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,210
driven field with fury and with hate.

21
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,300
And that fury needs an outlet.

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,810
And if it gets a purchase,

23
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,800
it can become unstoppable.

24
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,610
But it can also be controlled,

25
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,300
okay?

26
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,160
Because there is a
counter to all that evil,

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,863
okay?

28
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,870
There is the man that steps up and says,
no,

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:24,000
no, not today, not here, not
now. We will not do that.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,953
Okay.

31
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,950
And the dichotomy of leadership
and that they caught him.

32
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:34,630
He of war is so hard to balance.

33
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Soldiers are trained and
to have asked to kill

34
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,980
and yet they are also trained to be
humane and fair and moral and good

35
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,133
[inaudible].

36
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,400
So how does a warrior reconcile
those opposing forces?

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,600
That dichotomy.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,300
How does he know to balance

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,680
God damn faults rush through my mind
is I tried to decide what to do.

40
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,680
Women,
old men and kids,

41
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,800
obviously non combatants but
this is a free fire zone.

42
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,050
They are not supposed to be
civilians in this area. Yeah,

43
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:37,830
but dinks occasionally ignore those
warnings about free fire areas.

44
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,360
Maybe they're the point element for
Vietcong or Nva traveling behind them.

45
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,080
Maybe they're supposed to give the
warning if stopped. It's happened before.

46
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,473
In that case,

47
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,280
some of my men could come under fire
and be killed or wounded for six killed

48
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,770
that one dink last evening
and he had a Thompson,

49
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,650
there was a whole squad
of Kong in that group.

50
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,030
There was some incoming fire
when we made the Elz a dink,

51
00:04:03,031 --> 00:04:07,800
try to cost cross the dyke last night.
These people look innocent enough.

52
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:13,650
They may be carrying supplies for the
Kong in the area, food and or Ammo.

53
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,550
It's a free fire zone. Everyone is
supposed to be considered enemy.

54
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:21,900
I'm responsible for my men. They'll get
killed if I make the wrong decision.

55
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,590
These dinks coming toward
us mean nothing to me.

56
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,410
My men mean everything.

57
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,470
What if the dinks aren't innocent?

58
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,490
My men depend on me to keep them alive.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,070
I spoke softly to the men around me.
It's a lick on them.

60
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,070
When I give the order open fire,

61
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,810
I brought up the [inaudible]
to site in on the dinks.

62
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,330
SPAG was standing to my right,

63
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:55,170
his m 60 machine gun support it on
his hip by a sling around his neck and

64
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:58,230
shoulder.
He reached over and touched my arm.

65
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,060
His whispered voice reflected
the agony of doubt in his face.

66
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,890
No Sir, you can't kids, women.

67
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,670
He motioned toward the file
of people coming towards us.

68
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,930
I felt ashamed.
SPAG was right.

69
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,290
Wait one I whispered to the men around me,
I'll call for them to surrender.

70
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,670
I felt relieved capturing them.
What's the best solution?

71
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,130
If they were the point for a VC group,

72
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,920
I would just make sure none
of us was exposed to fire.

73
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:36,240
When we captured this point, the dinks,
we're almost to the intersection.

74
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,390
I stepped through the brush with some
of my men dung. Louis don't. Louis,

75
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:45,450
I warned they were only
10 to 20 meters from us.

76
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,960
They all glanced at us standing
with our weapons, trained on them.

77
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,520
We had them dead to rights.

78
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,020
They had no cover on no place to
run to a perfect capture situation.

79
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,900
Almost in mid.
They all moved with astonishing speed.

80
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,360
The two boys in the point split up. The
one ran past us heading down the trail,

81
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,760
pass the school house,
the other boy, the woman,

82
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:11,090
the old men started running back
towards the bridge. Stop. Stop.

83
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:15,380
Don't like Deloitte. I yelled to
no avail. I could not order them,

84
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,210
the men to run after them. It could be a
trap. Neither could I let them get away.

85
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,090
Why were they running in the split?
Second,

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,170
those thoughts ran across
my consciousness. I gave
the order to open fire

87
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,630
and irrevocable wave of
death swept in front of us.

88
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,600
After the initial burst of
gunfire, I yelled, cease fire.

89
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,500
The two women survive long enough to
cross the bridge and enter one of the

90
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,280
hooches.

91
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,370
Three of my men crossed over the bridge
and threw grenades and the hutches.

92
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,320
We heard lead looked over the bodies on
the trail since they were lying in the

93
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,080
open and we had no desire
to be caught exposed.

94
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,340
The men reported that some of the dead
had been carrying hand grenades in their

95
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,270
ammo and ammo packs.
I felt somewhat relieved.

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,200
Those supplies could have been for, could
not have been for anyone but the Kong

97
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,220
I received report from
the squad down the trail.

98
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,720
The firing had alerted them barely fast
enough to fire at the teenager running

99
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:15,830
toward them down the trail. Someone hit
him in the shoulder and knocked him down.

100
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,581
Surprisingly,

101
00:07:16,581 --> 00:07:20,630
the boy had jumped up and run past the
squad to safety somewhere in the brush.

102
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,270
I had no pleasure in reporting to Delta
six that we had killed six dinks and one

103
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:30,380
wounded. I knew who you would ask how
many happened weapons we had captured.

104
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,300
I stared at the gray horizon for a long
time before answering that. The dinks,

105
00:07:35,301 --> 00:07:38,540
we're not carrying weapons,
only supplies and grenades.

106
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,920
I felt low this putrid war.

107
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,490
I thought of so many ways I
could have done it differently,

108
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,420
so easy to think afterward.
After all,

109
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,420
now I knew there was no dink
squad behind on the trail.

110
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:57,950
This episode would be
the darkest of my career.

111
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,420
I called my men together for a march
up the slight hill to Delta six his

112
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:06,350
position forcing the dinks out of my mind.

113
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,950
Now that's from a book that
we're looking at tonight.

114
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:20,290
It's called the killing zone, my life
and the Vietnam War by Frederick downs.

115
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,190
Now Vietnam,
it was a hard war,

116
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,240
obviously a wretched
whore for many reasons,

117
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:35,590
and the mee Lai massacre
is almost the apex,

118
00:08:35,591 --> 00:08:36,760
almost the pinnacle.

119
00:08:36,761 --> 00:08:41,761
It almost seems like the essence
of the war in many respects.

120
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,780
At least it's viewed that way and
it did have a huge strategic impact.

121
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:52,960
It was devastating to the war effort
and something that should always be

122
00:08:52,961 --> 00:08:57,720
remembered is that tactical
operations can have strategic impact.

123
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,850
Like Hackworth said,

124
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,900
the mee Lai massacre probably did more
to end the war and he snored departure

125
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:07,290
from Vietnam.
Then anything are communist enemy did

126
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,340
okay

127
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,320
in in a similar vein in the war I was in,

128
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,150
in the mistreatment of the prisoners
in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and the

129
00:09:17,151 --> 00:09:21,980
photographs that showed that mistreatment
likely did more to fuel the insurgency

130
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:24,140
in that country than
anything al Qaeda did.

131
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:25,860
Okay.

132
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Tactical actions can have strategic impact
and that actually happens in business

133
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,010
too.

134
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,010
One bad customer experience for a customer
that's got some reach and there can

135
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,890
really be a strategic impact and what
the front line troops do really does

136
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,460
matter and what the frontline troops
do is based on how they are led.

137
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,920
Clearly in me lie,
there was a total lack of leadership,

138
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,390
especially from the moral
and an ethical perspective,

139
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,190
but this was not the norm,

140
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,090
not by any stretch and,
and like I said,

141
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,120
it's viewed sometimes as
the representation of what
the Vietnam War was like,

142
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,760
but it's not an, and I said this
when we talked about me lie, yeah,

143
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,200
America has done monstrous
things in our history,

144
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,310
but we most certainly are not monstrous.

145
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,020
We are an amazingly benevolent nation,

146
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:40,950
especially now perhaps
even to our own detriment,

147
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,990
but that's why I wanted
to talk about this book,

148
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,560
the killing zone to show the challenges,

149
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,570
the Vietnam War and how American troops
handled those challenges and pressures

150
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:58,881
on a day to day basis and how they
sometimes cross that line if only for a

151
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,600
moment,
but then

152
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,240
most of the time brought themselves
back from the brink of darkness

153
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:12,910
into the light.

154
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,610
Now let's go back to the book here.

155
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,743
Okay.

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Going to the beginning when Fred downs
young lieutenant in the army is flying

157
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,200
into Vietnam at 2130 hours.

158
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:40,460
The continental big bird with a golden
tail DCA dropped through the night sky

159
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:43,910
into the landing pattern over
the black landscape of Vietnam.

160
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,890
23 hours earlier,
165 of us had been crammed a board,

161
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,560
the commercial jet at the
airport near San Francisco.

162
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,360
I looked around the cabin at the
officer and enlisted at the officers and

163
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:58,990
enlisted men who'd come from all over the
United States to catch his flight from

164
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:02,680
San Francisco.
How would they return?

165
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,170
How would I return?

166
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,380
I had graduated six months earlier from
the U S Army to ocs program at Fort

167
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,920
Benning, Georgia, and now I would
seem to be leading men into combat.

168
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,680
I was 23 years old and I had
been trained to lead physically.

169
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,020
I thought I was ready.
Mentally.

170
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,200
I was as confident of myself
as any young officer could be,

171
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,790
but underneath my confidence
where the ever present questions,

172
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,600
worry and curiosity about
war and my role in it,

173
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,220
I was eagerly looking
forward to finding answers.

174
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,270
I would not have to wait long.

175
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,750
So we've talked about that before. When
you're stepping into a leadership role,

176
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,090
you're not going to get,
if there's a good chance,

177
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,660
you're not going to feel a hundred
percent confident. And that's okay.

178
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,630
So he gets to Vietnam,

179
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:03,340
he gets assigned to a fourth
division and he actually,

180
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:05,740
he hadn't heard of fourth division,
he hadn't seen it in the papers.

181
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:09,490
And he kind of is asking, hey, why, why,
why haven't I see that in the papers?

182
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:10,690
What are they doing?
And he said,

183
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,020
there's no reporters up there where
they're working. It's too rough for him.

184
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,840
And he's kind of saying, you know, I want
to get, I want to make sure I get it on.

185
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,080
And in some of the old timers are
telling them, one of them says,

186
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,470
you'll get a belly full of fighting up
there, son, if that's what you want.

187
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,110
So it's one of those,
be careful what you wish for scenarios.

188
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,280
And uh, I thought this was pretty,
pretty interesting. You know,

189
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:41,281
we talk about Hackworth and the hardcore
rock condos as the salute and reply.

190
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,870
The reply is no fucking slack.

191
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,200
So here's what they had here.

192
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,830
It was sop to solute in the fee and
the company area, but not in the field.

193
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,090
When enlisted man saluted, he
would say Golden Dragon, sir.

194
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,810
The officer would return the
salute with right of the line.

195
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,490
I asked about this. They told me that
in that the first, the 14th that's the,

196
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,560
that's the division.
He's with the first.

197
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:12,670
The 14th was an old infantry
regiment steeped in tradition.

198
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,930
During the boxer rebellion in China,
the unit had fought bravely.

199
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,170
Afterward they adopted the
symbol of a golden dragon.

200
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,900
The other part of the
solute came from some,

201
00:14:22,901 --> 00:14:26,500
some battle in the civil war
right before large battle,

202
00:14:26,501 --> 00:14:31,501
a staff officer asked a general where
to put the first to the 14th the general

203
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:35,170
had roared back, put them to the
right of the line where they belong.

204
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:39,880
The right of the line is where a leader
traditionally puts his best men in units.

205
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,550
This comes down through military history.

206
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,580
When a man fought with
the shield and sword,

207
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,460
the right arm or sword
arm was unprotected.

208
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,450
The best fighter was put the right to
protect the sword arm of the man on his

209
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,284
left.

210
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,460
Only the most trusted and best fighters
held the position to the right.

211
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,073
Legit.

212
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,980
So he's there in the, in
kind of in the, in the uh,

213
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,420
headquarters area for a little while
and then he gets his indoctrination and

214
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:15,320
then gets flown out.

215
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,520
He's flies out into the field into
where he's going to be operating out of.

216
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,870
He gets up there, and this is, this
is straight out of a movie right here.

217
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,090
Bug swarmed around my face.

218
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:32,000
I squatted and looked at the
men who looked right back at me.

219
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,830
It was my first view of American Gis who
had spent several days in the jungle.

220
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,810
I stood there and sparkling,
crisp, fatigues, brand new boots,

221
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,490
new rifle, clean shaven, fresh
haircut. I even smelled clean.

222
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,360
My helmet, camouflage cover didn't
have a mark on it, nor did I.

223
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,810
The two men opposite me were filthy.

224
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
They're fatigues or torn and they
had scratches all over their skin.

225
00:15:57,921 --> 00:16:01,820
Two or three days of growth on their
beard and dark circles under their eyes.

226
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,820
They look tired and they smelled
the high heavens. So that's,

227
00:16:05,821 --> 00:16:09,440
that's right out of a movie. The boot
lieutenant coming in to take over,

228
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,790
he's in his pressed Cam,

229
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:14,420
he's looking all squared away and these
guys look like they're living in hell.

230
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,450
And they introduce the,

231
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,130
the company commander and this guy
you're going to see throughout the book,

232
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:25,820
this guy captain cells was an
ROTC officer, 26 years old,

233
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:30,530
son of the son of a father
killed in Korea. So that's,

234
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,460
you know,

235
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,270
the guy's dad got killed in Korea and
he's there during the Vietnam War.

236
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:39,110
He's joining up and leading men at
a comedy is a company commander.

237
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,390
And if you remember from, from the
book platoon leader where you remember,

238
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:46,550
he didn't even meet the company commander.

239
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:48,860
So his direct boss didn't
even meet him for weeks.

240
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,710
He'd been in the field for weeks
before I even met him. And here's this,

241
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,880
this company commander obviously much
more squared away, walks him around,

242
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,030
introduces into, everybody's
given him a heads up, you know,

243
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:03,080
this is the way it's supposed to be.
And you know, he's getting told, look,

244
00:17:03,081 --> 00:17:04,370
there's any me all around.

245
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,160
And you might've heard in
that intro piece that I read,

246
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:11,270
I was talking about Delta six and,
and here's a little piece about that.

247
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,820
He informed me that his
radio signal was delta six.

248
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:16,910
So that's the Delta company commanders,
Delta Six, Lieutenant Smart,

249
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,640
the first platoon leader
was delta one six.

250
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,020
The second platoon leader was Delta two
six six is where the commanders of the

251
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,330
unit. And this is a tradition
that holds true in the,

252
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,150
in the army and the Marine Corps today.
And it's pretty cool when you're,

253
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,110
when you're in the field,

254
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,410
you'd hear someone call for the six and,

255
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:36,380
and that means that we want to talk
to the guy that's in charge out there.

256
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,470
Their seconds, a command. We're
known as fives. For instance,

257
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:44,000
Delta one five was the first platoon
sergeant. And this is a, you know,

258
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:46,130
goes on to talk a little bit
more about captain cells,

259
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:50,340
who's asking him about his
family. He's getting to know
him and he's, you know, uh,

260
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,150
uh, down's had, I had a wife and
two little girls back in Illinois.

261
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,360
And so again,
you're getting,

262
00:17:56,361 --> 00:18:00,010
the impression that sells is a guy that's
trying to get to know his people when

263
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,460
they learn about them, which
is, which is the way a leader,

264
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:03,660
what a leader should be doing.

265
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:10,770
Now these guys are out
and he's talking again.

266
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,100
This is, this is something straight
out of a straight out of a movie,

267
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,770
darkness quickly and Gulf to us.
My hooch.

268
00:18:16,771 --> 00:18:20,280
May Ch watched an astonishment as I
pulled out mosquito netting and spread it

269
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:22,590
over my poncho liner and air mattress.

270
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,850
They were aghast that I carried so
much extra weight. No, I answered.

271
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,260
This is all the good stuff.

272
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,240
That amazement grew as I revealed three
changes of underwear and fatigue. Close.

273
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,770
Wait until the next day they scoffed
when the sun is sun and heavy pack will

274
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:38,910
drag me down.

275
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,700
The jungle would exact a toll for every
ounce I carried. We'll see. I answered.

276
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,730
Not a good answer. Lieutenant
Smart said. Yeah. You'll see.

277
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,600
You'll see that the only change of clothes
your carriers and be an extra pair of

278
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:55,320
socks,

279
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,400
you'll learn to live in one set of
jungle fatigues until they rot off you or

280
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,920
grip to badly to where that's that. That
actually reminds me when we were in, uh,

281
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,140
my, my first deployment to Iraq, we, uh,

282
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,290
we had three sets of cammies and just
warm rotated them in Ramadi that the op

283
00:19:13,231 --> 00:19:18,231
tempo was so high and the conditions of
fighting we had to order new cammies.

284
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,940
We then within a couple
of weeks of being there,

285
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:24,660
guys had destroyed Caymus can run across
the street. They're getting, you know,

286
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,720
dragging people and they were
just ruining their, their cammies.

287
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:32,750
So that was another indicator in Ramadi
that we were in a totally different

288
00:19:32,851 --> 00:19:35,160
scenario than I was on my
first deployment to Iraq.

289
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,760
Back to the book.
My first days on combat control,

290
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:45,840
combat patrol introduced me
to the vicissitudes of war,
10 foot deep Punji pits.

291
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,651
Wait a minute,

292
00:19:46,651 --> 00:19:50,280
vines at collected around the feet and
legs until the combined strength stopped

293
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:54,600
you. And you had to say, wait a minute
while you untangled or cut yourself loose.

294
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,010
The Hot Sun beating down on us, on us as
we marched around with 70 pound packs,

295
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,360
the sweat pouring office,
the bugs,

296
00:20:01,361 --> 00:20:06,361
so stick our faces that around our faces
that we sometimes inhaled them of and

297
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:10,710
the physical agony of forcing
tired muscles to keep going.

298
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,020
It was a search and destroy mission,

299
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:17,880
which meant we searched all the hooches
we found and then burn them down whether

300
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:21,090
a single farmers, hooch or a
whole village, all were burnt.

301
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,330
The few Vietnamese we found in
the area where women, children,

302
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:28,590
old men who had been left behind, when we
started to burn their particular hooch,

303
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,650
they would start wailing, crying,
and pulling in our clothes.

304
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,550
We didn't harm the people, but the
orders were to destroy all the dwellings.

305
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,600
So we did.

306
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:40,680
The first time I saw a Vietnamese family
go into hysterics when their hooch was

307
00:20:40,681 --> 00:20:41,514
set on fire,

308
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,620
I was unsure of whether burning their
home would accomplish our mission.

309
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,950
The mission was to deny the enemy use
of the hooches to destroy any food we

310
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:54,280
found had to teach. The people a
lesson about supporting the enemy.

311
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,290
But I quickly got used to it and accepted
that this was one way to win the war.

312
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,660
And that's, you know, a
few. If you talk to anybody,

313
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,410
anybody knowledgeable about
true counterinsurgency,

314
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,150
this is not a great plan to go in and
basically abuse the populous. Now,

315
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:17,980
if you know that they're supporting
the, the insurgence, sure you want to,

316
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,880
you want to disrupt that.
But oftentimes they're not this,

317
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,520
they're not supporting the
insurgents because they want to,

318
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,550
they're there supporting the insurgents
because their fear for their lives.

319
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:31,060
That's the way it was in Iraq when,
when I was there.

320
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,310
So back to the book,

321
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,600
Sheldon brand took the opportunity
later that day to explain in the,

322
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,890
in this unit,

323
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,390
everyone called the enemy and
ultimately all outsiders dinks.

324
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,900
So that's their word that they use.
And I found this interesting. He says,

325
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,520
ultimately all outsiders, and you've
reverbed me and eve or lay from,

326
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,130
in the book we talk about Moose.
That's what we call it, the enemy,

327
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,030
we'd call it the enemy MOOC.

328
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,220
But what's interesting is here it says
all outsiders and that's exactly what we

329
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,410
do. If when we were getting
resistance from, you know,

330
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,270
up the chain of command
down the chain of command,

331
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,710
guess what we call them Moosh we'd say
all the boss is saying this or can't

332
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:14,910
believe that Mooc. So it became
the word that we use to every,

333
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,810
to all outsiders and that's,

334
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,840
that's the unit cohesion and there's
some dehumanization of the enemy there

335
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:22,834
obviously,

336
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,140
but the fact that you ended up using
the same slang word to describe anybody

337
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:31,630
that's against you is,
is is interesting.

338
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,341
Back to the book,

339
00:22:33,341 --> 00:22:36,820
it turned out that the enemy started
calling us dinks first because it was an

340
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,910
insulting or demeaning term that
meant hairy man from the jungle.

341
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,390
We had just turned the word around
and started calling them dinks.

342
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,630
At least that was the story. I don't
know if that's true or not. I never,

343
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,460
never read it,
didn't do any research on that one.

344
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,050
I saw the face of the
enemy for the first time.

345
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,750
He'd been machine gun down
by one of our gun crews.

346
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,990
The powerful weapon and throwing a hail
of bullets into the brush where we had

347
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:01,120
spotted him.
When we got to his position,

348
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:03,340
I saw for the first time
the death of a soldier.

349
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,910
The machine gun crew had done a good job.
The young soldiers,

350
00:23:06,911 --> 00:23:09,790
green combat uniform body
was riddled with bullets.

351
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:14,710
He was sprawled across his bicycle
with his face toward the sky. At last,

352
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:18,010
I had before me,
the enemy I had been trained to destroy.

353
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,500
He was a young man for whom the war
and life had ended. One evening,

354
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:27,010
a jet was returning to base and needed
a target to get rid of his unexpended

355
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:27,844
bomb load.

356
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,750
The captain called the forward
air controller and gave
them the coordinates of a

357
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:36,160
sniper 300 meters away who had been
pestering us off and on for three days.

358
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,940
As the jet pulled up after dropping
napalm on the snipers position,

359
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,300
we could hear the pop pop of
the sniper firing at the jet.

360
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,220
The men talked about the of that sniper.

361
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,410
As I watched the napalm burned itself out.

362
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,970
I wondered what would drive a man to
stand up to death and so remarkable a

363
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:54,804
manner.

364
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:57,300
Okay,

365
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,010
gain.
You're dealing with a hardened enemy.

366
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,930
You're getting napalm dropped on your
position and as you burned to death,

367
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,330
you're trying to shoot down a jet fighter.

368
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,641
Back to the book,

369
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:14,840
Sheldon brand was worth his weight in
gold to me in running that platoon,

370
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,980
he even introduced me to the
platoon motto. It's a lick.

371
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,580
A lick is a lick on a
young man's ass lieutenant.

372
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,090
You remember when you were a kid and
you did something wrong or something got

373
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:30,710
fucked up that you got the blame for the
old man would give you a licon with a

374
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:35,450
switch or a belt. Yeah, I sure
remember getting lickings well,

375
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:39,350
when something goes wrong, it's a lick
on you. You see anything that goes wrong,

376
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:42,830
I'll give you a lick and over
here you'll get plenty of licks.

377
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,760
My RTO was, or the other most
important man to the platoon.

378
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,580
His job was to carry the radio
and stick to me like a shadow.

379
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,440
The radio was our link with literally
everything outside our platoon from

380
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:58,850
supplies to survival without a
working radio. When a good Rto,

381
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,030
opportune leader and the platoon
were as good as lost in this war.

382
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,620
My RTO man, a skinny kid,
five feet, 11 inches tall,

383
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,820
was next to perfect for his job.
He loved to know what's going on.

384
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,960
And his job was a kin to the
central switchboard operators.

385
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,760
So that's the RTO. That's what that was
actually when I was an enlisted seal.

386
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,070
That's what I was. So I was a, I always
had that same attitude. When you're there,

387
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,060
when you're the Rto,
you always know what's going on cause the,

388
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,910
the officer's telling you,
you're right next to him.

389
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:30,980
You're listening to what he's saying.
So you always know what's going on.

390
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,830
And that was a real good education for me.
Hmm.

391
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,450
Grown my whole career.
Always be next to the,

392
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,830
to the guy that was
running in the platoon.

393
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,990
Talk a little bit about the troops here.
My squad leaders were first squad Delk,

394
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:47,960
a tall cowboy type from Wyoming,
second squad porter.

395
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,000
I light a slightly built black from east
Saint Louis, third squad, Jose, a skinny,

396
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:56,060
short, sparkly Puerto Rican
fourth squad, Gallagher,

397
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,150
a medium built redhead
from New England states.

398
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,610
And of course there was
the platoon medic doc,

399
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,380
but platoon makeup was whites,
blacks, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans,

400
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:11,210
Americans and an Indian
and a Japanese American.

401
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,260
All of them from 18 to 21
years old in a combat platoon.

402
00:26:15,261 --> 00:26:18,980
We were evaluated by our peers on our
ability to help the platoon survive and

403
00:26:18,981 --> 00:26:20,840
not on our racial backgrounds.

404
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,710
A combat platoon pulled together
and was tight with each other,

405
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,270
with no room for the soldier who
wouldn't do is share. So I, you know,

406
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:31,700
it's always good to just point that out.
These are just people for this,

407
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,760
a cross section of America and these,
these are pretty stereotypical,

408
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:37,490
right at cowboy from Wyoming.
It, you know, this is,

409
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,010
this is stereotypical stuff and that's,
that's one thing that the military,

410
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,520
so when I joined,
I grew up in New England,

411
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,550
right when I joined the navy and I got
to California and I went to the enlisted

412
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:54,480
man's Club on any B Corp Natto.

413
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:58,560
The gator gardens back in the day,
I was 18 years old,

414
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,420
19 years old. And I showed up, you know,

415
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:08,400
cause there's a club, it's a
club on base, right? And so I go,

416
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:11,070
oh, I'm going to go there.
People are saying, hey, we're
going to go to the club.

417
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:13,290
So I go, okay, well let's go
see what's going on there.

418
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,380
So I walk over to the club and
as I'm kind of standing outside,

419
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:21,030
I see two guys walk by with,
with jeans on,

420
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,050
with cowboy boots,

421
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:25,500
with big belt buckles and cowboy
hats and like a wrangler shirt.

422
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,920
And I was kind of thinking to myself, oh
that, that's there. Is there some kind of,

423
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,670
is it Halloween is the, these guys get
dressed up for something. And again,

424
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,330
this is pre internet
man. I mean, and, and,

425
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,930
and then I see a couple more guys go by
and it turned out it was country Western

426
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,600
night, but at the club, at the club.

427
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,560
But I had never seen a person in,
you know,

428
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:48,990
I come from a small town in,

429
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,710
in Connecticut and there's,
there's,

430
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,150
there's just no cowboys up there.
I mean,

431
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,830
interestingly there's farms and there's
people that raise cattle and there's

432
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:02,640
people that grow.
You don't have have farms,

433
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,360
but they don't have cowboy boots
and they don't wear cowboy hats.

434
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,550
And so it's just,
that's what I,

435
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:11,820
that's what I was thinking about when I
read this is just how you take all these

436
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:14,250
different people from all over the place.
They had no idea.

437
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:18,060
You have no idea what other people are
like. And again, this is pre internet.

438
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,660
You know, when I joined the navy, we
didn't get to Google. We didn't watch it.

439
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:25,530
Youtube videos because you,
you're exposed to the entire planet and,

440
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,660
and galaxy through youtube.

441
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,863
Yeah.

442
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,910
First Time you saw a
real cowboy. How it is.

443
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,330
I thought, I thought they were,
I thought they were dressed up.

444
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,680
I thought they were dressed up.
Yeah, it's crazy. It is kinda crazy.

445
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,930
Okay.

446
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,460
And then, you know, I ended
up, I mean the, in, in tea,

447
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,090
you bruiser we had all kinds of guys from
Texas and there's all kinds of cowboys

448
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:57,150
down in Texas. Uh, but
like Graham and Chris,

449
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Chris Kyle was like a legit whatever
Rodeo dude in Lafe later cowboy place and

450
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,530
absolute cowboy. Yeah, absolutely. I mean
there's all kinds of cowboys in there.

451
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,620
Yeah.
So all right.

452
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:14,760
Now we were going to advance a little
bit and it's the first time that that

453
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:19,650
Downes is actually in charge. Um,
he did a little turnover with the,

454
00:29:19,651 --> 00:29:20,910
with the form of platoon commander.

455
00:29:20,911 --> 00:29:25,911
He takes charge of a platoon and he's
doing security for the bridges for some

456
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:29,550
bridges that are out kind
of away from the main camp.

457
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,900
And they're out there to prevent landmines
and gathering Intel and kind of set

458
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:36,000
up a checkpoint. And, and
they're, they're, they're,

459
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:37,740
they're actually staying out there.
So they would,

460
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:42,160
they would set up by these bridges and
as they're getting set up for the first

461
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:45,820
time, I'm going to the book and
explosion, rip the air behind me,

462
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:49,150
followed immediately by a scream.
My body instinctively through my,

463
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,720
through itself, against the sandbags
is my mind shouted, mortar attack,

464
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,240
my eyes registered the scene of
men frozen in shocked Wunderman,

465
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,950
their eyes staring behind me.

466
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,340
Man was directly in front
of me and the track man,

467
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:05,800
we're off in the background
crouching where they,

468
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,710
where they were when
the explosions went off.

469
00:30:08,711 --> 00:30:12,790
So they're actually out there with some
tracked vehicles quickly turning around

470
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,670
my eyes swept and awful catastrophe.

471
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,530
One of the claymores had
gone off shattering for over
the lives of the three men

472
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:25,390
in front of it. Jesus Christ was in a
mortar. No one of our claymores went off.

473
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:29,590
Get those men quick. No, no wait, there's
another claim or out there. What the fuck?

474
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:34,240
Set it off. What about the
other one? So imagine this, you,

475
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,770
you get to a position and you
want to put out claymore mines.

476
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,200
And if you don't know what
a claymore mine is, it's a,

477
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:46,350
it's a directional blasting mine that
you set off by command detonation.

478
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:48,160
So you have a little,

479
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,160
a little thing that you squeeze
and when you squeeze this thing,

480
00:30:51,161 --> 00:30:54,160
it sends an electrical charge down
the wire into the claim or detonates a

481
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:58,120
blasting cap, the claim or explodes and
everything in front of it's going to die.

482
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,130
Well,

483
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,000
they had set up the claymores and then
they were going to put some barbed wire

484
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:08,500
out and as they were
putting the Barb wire out,

485
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,470
there was a storm,
electrical storm, you know,

486
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,600
thunderstorm and the static electricity
in the air actually set off the claymore

487
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:21,880
so it killed or it, it did some
serious damage back to the book.

488
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,830
Only a few seconds had passed.
Since the explosion,

489
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,160
one of my men and I dashed to the
other claim or frantically fumbling,

490
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:29,140
unscrewing the plug and
holding the bast and crap,

491
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,050
throwing it away from the claymore.
Then I rushed back to the radio.

492
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,820
Two men were applying first aid.

493
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,220
The other positions were covered
by the men assigned to them.

494
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,950
They had stayed in place during
the action. Good training.

495
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:42,550
I fought as I fumbled with my map.
It was folded into plastic radio bag.

496
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,100
All of us used to carry maps in Delta
six this is one six over one six this is

497
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,320
delta six over.
This is one six I need dust off.

498
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,990
There's been an accident
resulting in three peanuts over.

499
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,870
We tried to say nothing over the radio
that could be understood by the enemy.

500
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,970
Thus,
we used code words for certain things.

501
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,480
A koolaid was a dead soldier and
a peanut was a wounded soldier.

502
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,590
This is Delta six what
the hell happened over?

503
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,400
This is one six static
electricity in the air,

504
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,430
set off a claim while three trackman.
We're putting out barbed wire over.

505
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:16,960
This is Delta Sex. What's your position
over now? What would he ask me that for?

506
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,680
I was on the bridge heat assigned
to me. Let's see, we're here.

507
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:23,350
So I read writing up real easy,
just like all the training.

508
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:25,930
So he's looking at his maps, trying
to figure out where he is. Of course,

509
00:32:25,931 --> 00:32:28,930
that was my first responsibility
where men had been hurt,

510
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,460
so maybe that accounted for what happened
next in spite of training. Lieutenant,

511
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:36,100
Lieutenant, you've got to get
a dust off out here quick.

512
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,450
This man's got a bad head wound.
Said one soldier,

513
00:32:38,451 --> 00:32:39,920
as they brought the wounded over to me,

514
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,830
dirty black clouds of
lightning crashing around,

515
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,310
added the confusion as the wind
howled over from all directions,

516
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,420
huge range drops. Started to
spatter down. This is one six.

517
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,170
I'm at coordinates to nine
eight zero two eight over.

518
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:59,750
I read them out. This is Delta
six. Are you sure of that
over? This is one six. Uh,

519
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,620
let's see. Yeah, it's, that's
it. All right there. One, six.

520
00:33:03,621 --> 00:33:06,380
You better check that again.
According to what you gave me.

521
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:10,850
You're in the south China Sea over.
Oh, did he sound mad? God Damn.

522
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:12,140
I've done this a million times.

523
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,890
The thought ran through my mind is a sweat
broke out. The wounded were groaning.

524
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:19,510
The storm was reaching
gigantic proportions and the
track sergeant was demanding

525
00:33:19,511 --> 00:33:23,900
to know where that fuck that dust off was.
Concentrate Fred,

526
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,320
concentrate. I said to myself while
staring at the meaningless blob of colors,

527
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:30,260
worlds and numbers, so he's looking at his
map. It's just trying to figure it out.

528
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,640
Suddenly everything jelled and perfect
clarity. Delta six is one. Six.

529
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,780
You're right. My coordinates are
two eight eight zero two eight.

530
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,610
I need to dust off fast over one six.
This is Delta six.

531
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,670
I know where you are. I just wanted
to see if you could figure it out.

532
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,320
I already called the dust off.

533
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,440
So captain cells this, that's who he was
talking to. Captains cells. That's a,

534
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:56,900
that's Delta six,
the commander of the company.

535
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,030
And even in this pressure situation,

536
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,590
he's trying to make sure that the guy
is thinking he's in opportunity to think

537
00:34:03,591 --> 00:34:06,980
for the first time under pressure.
And he already called the dust off,

538
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,820
but he's still putting the test to him
and seeing how he operates under that

539
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:14,330
kind of stress and pressure.
Another uh,

540
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,280
following situation there,

541
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:19,970
they're kind of sitting in this location
and they see a woman start to start to

542
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,250
approach where they had some,

543
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,450
some equipment and she was looked like
she was going to steal some stuff and you

544
00:34:26,451 --> 00:34:29,210
know, was kind of no big deal. Okay,
she's gonna Steal. So whatever,

545
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:32,540
some ponchos or something,
well then they see her,

546
00:34:32,541 --> 00:34:36,740
what she picks up as a case of
grenades and they're thinking,

547
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,181
wait a second,

548
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:41,240
now this is just got really bad because
if she was stealing a Poncho, okay,

549
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:43,400
no big deal.
But if she's stealing grenades,

550
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:48,170
that's stuff that's going to be used
to come back and kill them. But again,

551
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,650
because we have a guy with a,
with a conscience, you know,

552
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:56,270
a guy that sees where the line of darkness
is and he doesn't want to cross it.

553
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,710
So instead of just shooting her,
which she could have done,

554
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:04,970
he loads a magazine of tracer
rounds into his, into his weapon,

555
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,190
and he starts shooting them around her
kind of warning shots and then eventually

556
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,110
start shooting.
He's a good shot.

557
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:17,140
He starts shooting at the little rope
that holds the case that she's holding on

558
00:35:17,141 --> 00:35:20,270
to. He starts shooting at that rope,
shoots out at like five or six times,

559
00:35:20,271 --> 00:35:23,240
finally hits the rope, kind,
Kinda hits her hand. She drops it,

560
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,510
she runs off again,

561
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:31,670
just trying to show the discretion that
this guy's using as a real contrast to

562
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,720
the meal. I episode. Now.

563
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,950
Speaking of that,

564
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,460
the little later on they
roll up some prisoners.

565
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,360
One is an old man and one is a young man

566
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,060
and this old gray haired sergeant
starts going after him to,

567
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:55,980
they got these two prisoners.
They're captured and here's the sergeant,

568
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,890
so you're the fuckers that
Zap my buddies in the tank.

569
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:01,350
The old grey hair sergeant
snarled without warning,

570
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:04,470
he swung a heavy fist in the face
of the old man knocking him down.

571
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,030
The other fist swung into the face.

572
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,220
The younger man knocking
them down beside the old man.

573
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,550
The sergeant was screaming and bellowing
as he pummeled the two men on the sand.

574
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,450
They rolled into balls for protection,
but we're hampered by their tied hands.

575
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,350
I ran from the road yelling my two men
to pull the sergeant off the prisoners.

576
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,400
They grabbed him by his soldiers as he
fought them to get back to the Vietnamese.

577
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,700
He lashed out with his foot
at the prisoners, catching
one of them in the side.

578
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:30,630
What the hell are you doing, sergeant?
Those men are my prisoners. I exclaimed,

579
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,470
his face was red with fury.
As he yelled back at me,

580
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,230
you had no right to take
those stinking Kong prisoners.

581
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,660
He smelled of beer that he had drunk.

582
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,320
You should have killed those motherfuckers
like they killed that other tank crew.

583
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,640
Fuck, these men are tied up. We don't
know who they are. I yelled back,

584
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,080
I was saved by the
sound of lieutenant nut.

585
00:36:50,081 --> 00:36:53,730
Can Knutson's voice breaking over
the argument? Calm down, sergeant,

586
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,840
go back to your tent.

587
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:58,230
So that was the other lieutenant was
the commander of the tanks. Again,

588
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:04,170
I'm pointing this out. He's
new in country. He sees
somebody beaten up a prisoner.

589
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,320
They had just lost a one of the tanks
to a mine earlier and obviously the gray

590
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:12,990
haired sergeants pissed and he
wants to take it out on these guys.

591
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,340
But you know,
calmer,

592
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,180
cooler heads prevailed in that situation.

593
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,320
Now speaking of minds
minds back to the book,

594
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:28,260
mind continue to be laid in the
road at irregular intervals.

595
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,490
It was a fact of life.

596
00:37:29,491 --> 00:37:33,270
But the terror of an explosion never
failed to send a shiver through our guts.

597
00:37:33,271 --> 00:37:36,540
No matter how many times we heard them,
whatever we were doing,

598
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:40,460
our heads would jerk around.
It was terrifying to hear the explosion.

599
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,890
See the ugly gray and black crowd
cloud is it ripped into the year.

600
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,540
See dark pieces of metal,

601
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:50,130
canvas machinery and human beings flying
in the blossom of death out from the

602
00:37:50,131 --> 00:37:51,240
center of destruction

603
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,380
and this one big mine happens and he's
going to check it out. It hits truck,

604
00:37:58,381 --> 00:38:01,320
hits a vehicle.
I approached the twisted wreck.

605
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,380
It was very disheartening
to see the smoking rec,

606
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,990
which had once been the
carrier of human beings.

607
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:12,030
There were with smoke drifting upward
from the HOLC. As we approach closer,

608
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,260
we saw parts of the driver's body mangled
beyond recognition in the cab and on

609
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,094
the ground.

610
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:22,220
That main portion of the driver was only
recognizable because we knew that was

611
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,420
what it was supposed to be.

612
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,660
My men ran toward the still living,

613
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:31,650
being huddled in the rice patty mewling
over and over that his leg was gone.

614
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,300
The scene of desolation brought about
the impact of the Vietnam War. To me.

615
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:40,480
There was no enemy to fire at.

616
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,720
There was no nothing to
retaliate against at a distance.

617
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,350
The traffic of vehicles
and Vietnamese watched.

618
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,280
Okay.

619
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:55,970
All that remained was the messy job of
cleaning up while thinking that this

620
00:38:55,971 --> 00:38:57,110
could happen to us.

621
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,820
A small part of her mind tried to retain
it's sanity by reminding yourself over

622
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:06,650
and over that it would never happen to us.
It can happen to everyone else,

623
00:39:06,651 --> 00:39:10,160
but it would not happen to me.
With that in mind,

624
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,640
we started scraping up what was left
preparing it for the plastic body bag.

625
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,920
Now
eventually they,

626
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,310
they go from guarding the bridges to
where they start doing patrols out in the

627
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,410
jungle and ambush is out in the jungle
and direct action missions out in the

628
00:39:38,411 --> 00:39:43,411
jungle and at this point they're out
in the jungle and I'll go to the book.

629
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,040
My platoon and I had not
shaved for three or four days.

630
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:52,900
Delta six was a bear about
shaving combat patrol or not.

631
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,140
Just because we live like animals
didn't mean we had to look like them.

632
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,520
Who was his way of thinking?
Throwing my fatigue jacket across a Bush.

633
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,990
I grabbed my shaving gear and told
spag and visa nor to accompany me.

634
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,970
We would guard each other as we shaved.

635
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:11,500
So the company commanders coming out and
there unshaven and they're like, okay,

636
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:15,010
we gotta shave real quick.
But again,

637
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:18,180
you can see that captain cells
has a real influence. Any,

638
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,850
you can see that that discipline,

639
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,270
it carries over.
And when you let it slack and,

640
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:27,550
but then you go visit your troops
and they'd have to get back in line.

641
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:30,100
It brings him back to humanity. It
makes, it reminds them that thing.

642
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,143
Cause think about it,

643
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,720
that shaving is something you do
in the military every single day.

644
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,810
So when all of a sudden you're out
in the field, you start losing that,

645
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:41,440
you start slipping away
from that and things start.

646
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:44,280
Other things start slipping away as well.
Hmm.

647
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,260
They get into a,

648
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,210
they get into some firefights out there
and at one point he gets wounded and I'm

649
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:57,820
going to the book.
After homes had finished bandaging my arm,

650
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,690
I put on my fatigue jacket and
lit a cigarette. I felt good.

651
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,290
I'd only been in country a few months
and I had my second purple heart.

652
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:10,450
The first one had been from a wound
received an October to top it off.

653
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,220
I had been wounded twice in one day,

654
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,910
shot in the ear in the morning and hit
with a grenade, shrapnel in the afternoon.

655
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,120
Luck was with me.
All three wounds had been slight.

656
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:26,070
Now you can say luck when you get shot
in the ear and you are lucky for sure,

657
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:30,370
but that's,
that's a real,

658
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,040
that's a real eyeopener indicating that
you realize how close you were to dine

659
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:40,050
and I had guys get shot in the helmet
and and they didn't like it one bit

660
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,620
because that's real close.
Someone got real close to getting you

661
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,350
now going forward more. There's a,

662
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:56,380
there's a battle going on and the
companies out in the field and they're not

663
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:01,690
directly involved in the battle
so they get told, okay you,

664
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,930
we want you to go set up where the,
where we think the,

665
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,350
the VC is going to run to where
we think they're going to run.

666
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,520
You guys set up a blocking force
so that way when the VC runs into,

667
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,030
you ambush them and take them out.

668
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,730
So they're kind of
maneuvering to go set that up.

669
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,820
His platoon is maneuvering to set
that up and we'll go to the book.

670
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,020
After 15 minutes or so, we were
approximately halfway down the ridge.

671
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,400
The captain gave me a call.

672
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:26,540
Dragon six had decided it would be better
if I have to my platoon marching the

673
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:29,690
two elements in opposite directions
in order to cover a larger area.

674
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,730
I was dead set against this. My platoon
was below strength and dividing.

675
00:42:34,731 --> 00:42:39,650
It would be asking to reinforce rifle
squads or defend hundreds of acres of

676
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:42,560
jungle against a foe of unknown size.

677
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,860
So dragon six is above
the company commander.

678
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,020
This is now the battalion commander.

679
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,290
And so now you're getting an order
from the battalion commander. So it's,

680
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:51,861
you know,

681
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:55,490
you're a young lieutenant
platoon commander and you're
getting told to do this

682
00:42:55,491 --> 00:43:00,350
and he doesn't feel good about it back
to the book. But orders were orders,

683
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:05,351
especially from dragon six I pass back
the ward for Sheldon brand to come up.

684
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,470
I was pouring over my map and compass
when Sheldon brand reached me,

685
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:13,030
the battle was full,
the full blown it sound,

686
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:15,060
it sound provided background noises.

687
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,670
I briefed Shelly on the situation and
our orders, shit, I don't like it sir.

688
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,380
I know I don't either. But it's a lick.
You got your map and compass. Good.

689
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,840
So there's all kinds of reasons
why they don't like this idea.

690
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:35,150
Uh, obviously one that he already
stated was that, you know,

691
00:43:35,151 --> 00:43:38,960
you take your platoon and you cut
them in half. That's, that's just,

692
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,190
you don't have the same fighting
capability at all. I think they had one,

693
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,260
one heavy machine gun and each squad.

694
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,290
So now you've got basically they're
down to two squads cause they were under

695
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:52,340
strength. So we're talking one
heavy machine gun. And by the way,

696
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:54,530
if somebody gets wounded,
you know,

697
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:56,480
you got your wound do guy and
if you're gonna carry that guy,

698
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:59,240
it takes two or three guys to carry
the guy. So that's four guys go on.

699
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:03,830
So you could very easily be outnumbered
outman and Outgun by the enemy.

700
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,890
So he doesn't like this idea.
On top of that, I will tell you,

701
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:10,700
he doesn't talk about it here. When
you split up in a situation like this,

702
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,570
it becomes very difficult to do command
and control and now you've got two

703
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:17,380
elements that are weak size and you're,

704
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,240
you're no longer able to
support each other. That's the,

705
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,220
that's the premise of cover move.
Covered.

706
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:24,200
Move means you want to be close enough
that you could support each other.

707
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,470
You don't want to split far apart where
you can't help each other if something

708
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:32,430
happens. Well that's what they're
getting told to do. They don't it and,

709
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,500
but they do it and maybe he should
have protested more, but he's getting,

710
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,830
he's getting orders from the battalion
commander and he says, okay, let's do it.

711
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,820
And of course,
within a couple of minutes of doing it,

712
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,270
they lose radio contact.
So now they can't,

713
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,330
they can't hear each other and
they're starting to march apart.

714
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,500
Finally they get radio, uh, they
get connected on the radio again,

715
00:44:55,501 --> 00:45:00,240
they get columns again. And it sounds
like this one five this is one six.

716
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,440
Have you figured out where you are yet?
This is one five negative.

717
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:09,360
So Shelley with his squad is lost,
doesn't know where he is.

718
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,750
Okay. Now the lieutenant is
all set up though. They're,

719
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,730
they're in their position where they're
thinking the enemy might come by.

720
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,080
They're set up to attack them
and here we go. Back to the book,

721
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:25,650
Lieutenant Porter risks whispered
as he reached my side where he,

722
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,450
we hear noises to our front.
Men are moving across in
front of us in the jungle.

723
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,020
Hold on a second. Porter.
One five. This is one six.

724
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,060
The sound of the battle
should be on your right.

725
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,120
If you're going in the right
direction where the sound's over.

726
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:42,060
This is one five negative on the right.

727
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:47,180
The sounds are on the left over one five
did you just say the sounds are on your

728
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,630
left? I was squeezing the handset so
hard. My knuckles were white. Affirmative.

729
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:53,430
Affirmative.
Jesus Christ.

730
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:57,060
One five I Horsley whispered
intensely into the mouthpiece.

731
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,650
You're heading in our direction.

732
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,400
I could hear the sounds of men
moving through the jungle below us.

733
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:06,000
I whisper deporter get back down there
and tell the men to hold their fire.

734
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,830
That may not be dinks.
After all,

735
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:12,810
hurry porter and heard the conversation
with Shelley and quickly turned to are

736
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,070
to carry out my order.

737
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,790
He couldn't yell because the sounds
were coming from the dinks soldiers.

738
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:21,480
His yelled would put us in jeopardy.
As porter started toward the crew,

739
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:26,130
the machine gun crew, open
fire, the harshness of the guns,

740
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:30,120
multiple explosions ripped across my
thoughts as it sound echoed through the

741
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,190
handset I was holding next to my ear,

742
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,700
the sound of American
swearing and screaming,

743
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:40,280
rebounded from the jungle below and
from my handset cease fire. I screamed,

744
00:46:40,281 --> 00:46:45,281
cease fire so he can actually hear
his guys getting shot by his own guys.

745
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,680
We have a blue on blue porter
and I were running the gun crew.

746
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,960
Both of us yelling,
cease fire, cease fire,

747
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,100
the sound of their gun blanketing the
screens in front of them abruptly.

748
00:46:56,101 --> 00:47:00,690
The gun quit firing. I yelled into
the jungle. Shelly, is that you? Yes.

749
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:05,010
Yes. Stop firing. Don't fire.
I was answered by many voices.

750
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,940
I stood there and instant the horrible
realization that I had fired on my own.

751
00:47:11,101 --> 00:47:15,240
Men's swept over me like a
wave from an ice cold. Hell,

752
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,800
the gun crew looked at me,
their faces filled with shock.

753
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,540
I ran leaping and falling down to the
brush line where my men were asking the

754
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,340
question to anybody hit for Christ's sake,

755
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:31,000
Gallagher yelled back as I burst into a
small clearing, one man, the point man.

756
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,760
So there you go.
Blue on blue.

757
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,620
Another reason why if you don't
have to separate your forces,

758
00:47:39,621 --> 00:47:43,370
you don't. You don't separate your
forces and unless you have to,

759
00:47:43,371 --> 00:47:47,450
and when you do what you do
with extreme caution, and we,

760
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,000
we've w I think every book we've,
we talk about blue on blue,

761
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:51,920
it happens in all these books.

762
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:54,800
It happens in my book and some
of these descriptions right here,

763
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:59,570
I recognize those 100% when he says the
horrible realization I had fired on my

764
00:47:59,571 --> 00:48:02,420
own, bent, swept over me like a
wave from an ice cold. Hell yeah,

765
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,920
I totally recognize that. And the fact
that he says the gun crew looked at me,

766
00:48:06,921 --> 00:48:08,750
their faces filled with shock when I,

767
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,860
when I explained to my guys in the
field like that was a blue on blue.

768
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:14,960
Their faces were just complete shock.

769
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:21,470
If you're in the military,
if you're in law enforcement,

770
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,400
be very careful when you
split your forces. It's,

771
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,570
it just multiplies the challenges.
Sometimes it is necessary,

772
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,610
but you got to keep control over it.

773
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,310
And now we go to where he's calling for
a evac for his, for his wounded guy.

774
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,103
Okay.

775
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,920
Delta six. This is one six over, this
is delta six over, this is one six.

776
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,880
I need a dust off for a peanut.
We run into a little action over.

777
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,270
This is Delta six. What do you mean
a little action? What's going on?

778
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:55,800
What happened over my knees felt
weak and my stomach was sour.

779
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,020
This is one six.

780
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,920
We had a little difficulty
with w with the terrain and uh,

781
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,060
I ambushed one five over what?

782
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,660
How the fuck did you do that one six
you mean your ambushed your own men?

783
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,400
What kind of outfit are
you running up there?

784
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,470
That's the most asinine
thing I've ever heard of.

785
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,410
You get your head out of your ass one
six and get that platoon straightened up.

786
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:20,550
You've got that over.
This is one six affirmative over.

787
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:21,960
Okay.

788
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,230
Ah, one six gimme your coordinates.
The dust offs. Honest way.

789
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,160
How bad is your peanuts over?
This is one six. Not too bad.

790
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,460
He'll lose a couple of toes, but
everybody else is okay over, all right.

791
00:49:32,461 --> 00:49:34,860
One six settle down out.

792
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:36,120
Yeah.

793
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,690
He was more gentle with the
last transmission because
I'm sure he heard my voice

794
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:43,260
and showed the strain I was feeling,
whatever the reason,

795
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,060
I welcome the sound of his voice.

796
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:48,750
Perhaps he understood better
than I thought what had happened,

797
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:54,430
so he comes at him real hard. He realizes
that the guy feels horrible and me and,

798
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,700
and then he kind of backs
off and to settle down.

799
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:59,040
He also knows he's got
to stay in the game.

800
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,930
He's got to get him to stay in the game.

801
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,200
And there's a nightmare of a video on
youtube of then just actually it's from a

802
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:07,351
documentary,

803
00:50:07,351 --> 00:50:11,970
but there was a really bad blue on blue
in the first Gulf war where a Apache

804
00:50:11,971 --> 00:50:16,310
gunship led up, lit up. Uh, I think it was
a Bradley, some kind of APC, the one that,

805
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,580
it's a nightmare,
but you can hear the one guy that fired,

806
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,760
they're saying, hey, you got to
get back in position, you know,

807
00:50:23,761 --> 00:50:26,670
hold the line basically. And he's
like, ah, I just killed my own guys.

808
00:50:26,671 --> 00:50:28,310
I want to come. And they're,
they're saying negative.

809
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,460
And so that's basically what this,
what captains cells is doing here saying,

810
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:35,870
hey listen, okay I'm pissed.
But guess what? Calm down,

811
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:40,820
settle down, get your shit together.
And he sits out in and, and by the way,

812
00:50:40,821 --> 00:50:43,910
for those folks that aren't military over,

813
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,580
when you say over at the end
of a transmission on the radio,

814
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,620
it means you expect a reply.

815
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:54,140
When you say out there is
no reply expected. So like
when we end this podcast,

816
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:58,310
I say out cause it's over there. Don't
say anything back to me. It's over.

817
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:02,390
I don't say over and and sometimes you'll
hear people say over and out in the

818
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:05,000
military that doesn't, you don't
say that. It doesn't make any sense.

819
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,960
So when you hear that in a movie, no,
that they know that they are cheesy,

820
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:13,680
that kind of like when you,
when they hang up the phone on the movie,

821
00:51:13,681 --> 00:51:16,830
he goes [inaudible] and you
hear the dial tone. Yes.

822
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,980
That doesn't really happen either.
I trudged back back to the book.

823
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:25,770
I charge it back to my position one five
and his men following man handed me a

824
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,473
can of coffee.

825
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,130
I chain smoke my cigarettes and drink
coffee while the platoon expanded into a

826
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:33,620
larger perimeter,
I stood facing the mountain,

827
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,830
the battle still raging on
one five walked over to me,

828
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,690
still shaking from his experience.

829
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:42,230
He told me how he was sorry that he
had gotten to me in such a Dutch with a

830
00:51:42,231 --> 00:51:46,110
captain and we discussed the operation
going over his mistake while we attempt

831
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:49,730
to figure out ways to keep it from
happening again, if we were ever split up,

832
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,480
Shelly and I had been through too much
together for me to blame him for what had

833
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:56,390
happened.
I told him so and we let it go at that.

834
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,330
We have been lucky besides,

835
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,100
I blamed myself for what had happened.
The responsibility for any units,

836
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:07,130
actions ultimately rests
with its commander.

837
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,840
The leader got the glory when things
worked out and he took the blame when they

838
00:52:11,841 --> 00:52:15,330
didn't.
That went with the job.

839
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,160
When it came right down to it,

840
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,270
the men were my responsibility
and I had failed them today.

841
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:24,183
Okay.

842
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,170
Little bit of extreme ownership.

843
00:52:27,171 --> 00:52:29,600
If you read the book extreme
ownership that Leif and I wrote,

844
00:52:29,601 --> 00:52:31,850
the opening chapter,
that's what it's about,

845
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:35,690
blue on blue and doing exactly what
what lieutenant downs did. Right.

846
00:52:35,691 --> 00:52:38,690
They're taking ownership of what the
mistakes were made in the battlefield

847
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,220
back to the book. There's a couple
of got well actually not yet there.

848
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:51,380
They link up with another with another
platoon and now they're having a

849
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:53,310
conversation.
Uh,

850
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:56,660
Downes is having a conversation
with another officer named Anderson.

851
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,930
A dink was lying next to us as we talked.

852
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,690
He had a black ace of spade stuck onto
his fist. Handerson what's that all about?

853
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:10,280
That's so the dinks no, what outfit
fucked them up over here. Look around.

854
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:13,730
Most of the dinks got those in
their hands. Sure enough, the dinks.

855
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:17,030
We're all holding an ace of spades.
That's a good idea.

856
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:20,750
But where'd you get all the aces? One of
the guys. Mom's works in a card store,

857
00:53:20,751 --> 00:53:23,810
so he wrote home asking her to send her
a couple packs of nothing but an ace of

858
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:24,644
spades.

859
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,060
Why did we want to kill dinks after all,

860
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,050
we had mostly been law abiding citizens
back in a world and we were taught that

861
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:35,820
to take another man's life was wrong.

862
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,390
Somehow the perspective
got twisted in a war.

863
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,400
The government told us it was all right
and in fact a must to kill members of

864
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:48,510
another government's per people.
Then we had the law on our side.

865
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:52,500
It turned out that most of
us liked to kill other men.

866
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,510
Some of the guys which shooted a dink
as much as they would at a target.

867
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:03,130
Some of the men didn't like to kill a
dink up close. The close to the killing,

868
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,690
the more personal it became.

869
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:08,440
Others in the platoon
like to kill in clothes.

870
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,950
A few even like to torture the dinks
if they had a prisoner or cut the dead

871
00:54:11,951 --> 00:54:14,200
bodies with knives and
a frenzy of aggression.

872
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,970
A few didn't like to kill it all and
wouldn't fire their weapons except to

873
00:54:18,971 --> 00:54:21,730
protect their buddies.
Mostly.

874
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:25,270
We all saw it as a job in
rationalized it in our own way

875
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:27,101
over.

876
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:32,101
It all ran the streak of anger or fear
that for brief moments ruled us all.

877
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,950
My job is platoon leader was to
control the spectrum of emotions,

878
00:54:38,951 --> 00:54:41,290
to guide the men towards survival.

879
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,660
I didn't believe in torturing or and
allowing a dink to die lingering death in

880
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:48,970
the jungle. We never took
prisoners. If we can help it.

881
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,710
Every day we spent in the jungle eroded
a little more of our humanity away.

882
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,660
Prisoners could escape to become
our enemy again. Hence no prisoners.

883
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:04,660
The philosophical arguments in favor of
man's ability to resist the slide into

884
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:05,800
barbarism,
sound,

885
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:09,850
noble and rational in a
classroom or at a cocktail party,

886
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:12,970
but when the enemy is bearing down on you,

887
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,280
bent on taking your life away from you,

888
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:20,200
it's not his country against your
country, not his army, against your army,

889
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,840
not his philosophy
against your philosophy.

890
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:27,190
It's the fact that that son of a bitch
is trying to kill you and you better kill

891
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:32,070
him first.
That's a reality right there.

892
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:37,080
Now going back to tactics a little bit,

893
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:43,200
back to the book, there was a spot about
midway down the mountain marked in blue.

894
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,920
That meant something bigger than a stream.
If I were an enemy commander,

895
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:50,550
that would be a perfect spot for a camp.
High mountains on three sides,

896
00:55:50,551 --> 00:55:55,020
a good water supply, thick jungle growth
and escape path in any directions.

897
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,690
If he decided on that location,

898
00:55:57,691 --> 00:56:00,450
the any we could commander would be
counting on attack from the valley up

899
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:01,590
towards his location.

900
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:06,540
He would have his back guarded but
not very heavily or so. I reasoned.

901
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,020
I just liked that because you can see
he's getting his mind in the mind to the

902
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:12,990
enemy. He's thinking about what he's
looking at the map. He sees the stream,

903
00:56:12,991 --> 00:56:17,310
he sees valley, he sees good, good,
uh, covered positions from three sides.

904
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,430
He's thinking, okay, this is what the
enemy must be thinking right here.

905
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,660
Now the, the fighting continues
and as always, you know,

906
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,220
I'm burning through book.
I mean, this is, uh,

907
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,660
this is a 250 page book and
I'm reading, you know, what,

908
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:36,580
maybe 20 pages from it.

909
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,500
So there's so much action going on in,

910
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:44,500
in so many good lessons to learn.
Obviously I can't cover them all.

911
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:49,300
That's why you can buy this book
yourself as you should. But here we go.

912
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,910
I'm going to a point here where
they've been in a firefight.

913
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,390
They'd got three wounded.
One of the guys lost an arm,

914
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:57,850
one of them is unconscious
and they're getting a,

915
00:56:57,851 --> 00:57:01,330
they have a helicopter to come in and
the helicopters lowered down a cable and

916
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:04,300
they're lifting the guys out to
get them to a med evac situation.

917
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,770
Back to the book, the signal was given
and the cable pulled him off the ground.

918
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:13,630
About halfway up he waved to all of us
just grinning like a Cheshire cat blood

919
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:17,260
dripped on us. It was a picture
I shall always hold in my mind.

920
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,700
A man dangling from a cable holding a
stick fastened to a tourniquet on the

921
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:24,970
stump of his leg, waving at his
comrades with the other hand,

922
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,430
a cigarette dangling from his lips.

923
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:33,340
One six is getting hairy up here. We're
starting to take fire. The pilot reported,

924
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,080
hold on just one more.

925
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,120
SPAG and I lifted the unconscious man
up while we slid the vest on to him.

926
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,060
Someone had to be the cable,
which I hooked onto the ring.

927
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:46,210
The unconscious man was winched upward,

928
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:48,460
dangling like a limp doll
at the end of a cable.

929
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,660
SPAG and I stood underneath
watching this final exodus.

930
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,800
As the crew man reached out to
grab the man, something went wrong.

931
00:57:57,730 --> 00:58:02,730
The man had become unhooked and somehow
fell through 50 feet of sky towards us.

932
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:07,380
We jumped back as the man fell in a heap,
better feet,

933
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:12,130
the medic and I pulled the man over.
Fuck,

934
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:13,630
he stopped breathing.

935
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,720
He goes on to say the attrition rate
on our side was terrible on our morale.

936
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,840
Although we killed and
wounded many of the Nva,

937
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,700
we never knew how much it hurt them.

938
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,950
It seemed there was an unlimited number
to take their places, but on our side,

939
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,530
when we lost a man,
we all knew

940
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,450
and it wore heavily on our minds.

941
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:41,350
The constant marching and fighting
demanded two things of us,

942
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:44,260
strength and absolute reliability.

943
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,490
Now they're moving out on another
operation and there was one of the,

944
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:58,550
one of the soldiers named
Yoder Yoder was the point man.

945
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:03,930
He was experienced and full of good humor
due to his promotion to door gunner.

946
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,890
A good man to have on point any day.
He was aggressive and unafraid,

947
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,320
even though he was going in soon.

948
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:13,140
There was no question of putting
someone else in his place on point.

949
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,570
It was his turn and he would
not have in any other way.

950
00:59:15,571 --> 00:59:18,420
So he's getting promoted to door gunners.
He's gonna get pulled out of the field,

951
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:19,800
is going to fly around in the helicopter.

952
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,360
You relatively safe compared
to being in the field.

953
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,530
He reminded me of a hillbilly with this
course, language, mannerisms and humor.

954
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,730
I was always asking him who he was
going to get that front tooth replaced,

955
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,540
that missing tooth made him look more
like a hillbilly than anything else.

956
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,700
He always laughed and said,
fuck sir,

957
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:44,480
I ain't about to let them fucking
army dentist work on me. She had no,

958
00:59:44,481 --> 00:59:45,770
that would be a lick on me.

959
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:48,450
Yeah.

960
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:52,740
So they continue their patrol and they're
coming up on this kind of flat area

961
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:58,020
and Yoder crept forward in a crouch,
looked back at me and grinned.

962
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,390
I grin back and nodded my head.

963
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:05,840
Yoder stepped over a tree root holding
up part of the small gully bank.

964
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:07,380
Okay.

965
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:11,070
At that moment, all hell broke
loose as a chai come machine guns.

966
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:12,480
Strafed the point element.

967
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,840
Yoda was hitting the body and
fell forward into the gully.

968
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,220
The machine gun acted as a key
which triggered a complete ambush.

969
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:25,200
We walked into a classical u shaped ambush
with a machine gun being at the base

970
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:29,100
of the EU, so this is, we
used to call this a fire sac.

971
01:00:29,101 --> 01:00:33,010
When you're get ambushed and you're
completely surrounded by the enemy and

972
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,590
that's where there,
that's where they are,

973
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,270
starts with this machine gun and
and Yoder and then just breaks out.

974
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:42,973
Okay,

975
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,081
explosions,

976
01:00:44,081 --> 01:00:47,380
machine guns and rifle bullets rip through
the air and ricocheted off the ground

977
01:00:47,381 --> 01:00:50,560
and trees around us. The
noise was overwhelming. Men
were screaming and yelling,

978
01:00:50,561 --> 01:00:53,620
trying desperately to get covered or
screaming when they were hit or thought

979
01:00:53,621 --> 01:00:55,690
they were hit,
which was almost as terrifying.

980
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:59,260
We still not seen any of the enemy
in the thick growth around us.

981
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,870
Most of us in the point play dead.

982
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:06,100
I lay trying to get my thinking
organized as to what to do.

983
01:01:06,101 --> 01:01:10,360
So you're just taking massive, a ambush
and you're laying there thinking, well,

984
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,380
what am I going to do?

985
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:12,750
Okay.

986
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,020
I could hear Yoder crying on the other
side of the route where he had fallen.

987
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,220
He cried out for me to come and
get him lieutenant, I've been hit.

988
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:23,910
I've been hit bad. I'm dying. Please
come and get me. Please come and get me.

989
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:25,500
Okay.

990
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,060
I turned my head in his direction.

991
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:32,040
Twigs and bark from trees were falling
like snow all around us as the charitable

992
01:01:32,041 --> 01:01:35,490
shrapnel and firepower rip
through the jungle around us.

993
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:37,890
I was terrified.

994
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,840
So they're,
they're pinned down and

995
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:46,910
okay,

996
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,910
he's actually ends up going to try
and help one of the other guys.

997
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:53,540
First,
a guy named bell,

998
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,580
then he gets to bell under
covering fire and he says,

999
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:01,520
bell was able, was able to help
me but couldn't see anything.

1000
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:02,660
He limped and crawled.

1001
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:06,860
I pushed and swore as we continuously
fell in our flight back up the hill.

1002
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:10,580
As I pulled him up the hill, one of my
feet was shot up from, from underneath me.

1003
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,810
I've been shot in the Hilo,

1004
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:15,470
one of the bullets knocking off
a piece of my boot heel and then,

1005
01:02:15,530 --> 01:02:17,000
and the force had knocked me down.

1006
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:20,350
I got a begin and felt a tremendous
blow to my hip, knocking me down.

1007
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,040
He had again,
I thought finally I got bell behind.

1008
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:25,530
A rock doc was there and
started working on him.

1009
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:29,370
I lay on my back looking up at
the sky through the jungle canopy,

1010
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,950
not believing I'd actually
made it down there and back.

1011
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,700
Yoda was still down there and although
I had witnessed the bullets hitting him,

1012
01:02:35,701 --> 01:02:38,940
I didn't want to leave.
I had to be absolutely sure he was dead.

1013
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:42,390
I would never forgive myself if I
pulled back and he was still alive.

1014
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:48,560
I was ready to call artillery in
on our position if we were overrun,

1015
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:50,310
and that's like the ultimate,

1016
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:52,280
okay,

1017
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:56,840
the ultimate game over move. We're
going to be overrun by the enemy. Okay,

1018
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:00,710
here we go. I'm going to call, call
all ordinance on my position drop,

1019
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,070
but luckily the fire subsides.

1020
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,130
The one of the other platoons had come
to their help and now that other platoon

1021
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:11,150
shows up and the enemy's pretty
much gone and it stopped shooting.

1022
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:13,280
We all stood up.

1023
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:17,480
A couple of my man and I ran down to
where three six his point with standing

1024
01:03:17,481 --> 01:03:22,180
over Yoder, I leaped over the edge
of the goalie and stop at younger.

1025
01:03:22,181 --> 01:03:25,400
His body kneeling down.
I turned his body over.

1026
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:30,500
He died with his headline downhill.
His face was a dark blue from the blood,

1027
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:33,260
which gravity had pulled into
the downhill portion of his body.

1028
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,660
There wasn't much blood on his body,

1029
01:03:35,661 --> 01:03:39,620
but numerous bullet holes were cut into
his fatigues covering his stomach and

1030
01:03:39,621 --> 01:03:43,700
chest. His eyes were closed.
I looked at him for a moment.

1031
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:46,610
My thoughts running back to our
many conversations in the past.

1032
01:03:47,330 --> 01:03:51,080
Once we had discussed whether we would
go to the aid of one of our fellow

1033
01:03:51,081 --> 01:03:52,760
soldiers if he was in trouble,

1034
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:56,960
I told him I would always respond to
one of my men if they needed help.

1035
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:02,870
He had replied it would be a lick on me.
I wondered if he had known that.

1036
01:04:02,871 --> 01:04:04,070
I tried to get to him.

1037
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:08,780
He was the first man
under my command to die.

1038
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:11,303
Yeah.

1039
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,600
I looked up to see some
of my platoon in three,

1040
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:18,220
six per tune standing over a dink body,
and the goalie, three six had an Indian,

1041
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:21,010
his platoon and I had
an Indian in my platoon.

1042
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:25,390
They drew their knives and slashed
the enemy's body and frustration.

1043
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,670
This was the only dead dink.

1044
01:04:27,671 --> 01:04:31,420
The men could find one lousy dink
for all that pain and suffering.

1045
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:35,110
At least we could take our hate
out on that son of a bitch.

1046
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:42,200
They'd also taken one prisoner as well.

1047
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:47,020
The the other platoon head
answer.

1048
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:51,390
Now he starts thinking back
to the book. This is it.

1049
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:55,410
I thought I'd been wounded four
times in battle. I had done my job,

1050
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,430
captains cells had asked after my third
wound, if I wanted to be sent back,

1051
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,530
anyone with three wounds was do that.

1052
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,400
All it took was two wounds to get
you out of the field. Surely forward,

1053
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:08,100
let me live with myself.
What was I trying to prove?

1054
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:12,420
But I answered my own question.
The men depend on me.

1055
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:16,500
It's my job to keep them alive by giving
them good leadership and looking after

1056
01:05:16,501 --> 01:05:20,590
them. They need me. Yeah,

1057
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:23,590
but shit,
what did I own myself?

1058
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:25,870
I had a wife and two
little girls who needed me.

1059
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,030
The $10,000 in insurance money wouldn't
do them much good. Where did my duty lie?

1060
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:36,490
I was still shaking. I couldn't go
through this again. Reluctantly.

1061
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:40,900
Almost against my will. I started
walking toward the captain. Captain?

1062
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,580
Yes. Fred. You asked once if I
wanted to go out of the field,

1063
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:50,590
if I had been wounded a third time, he
turned and looked into my face. Yes.

1064
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,260
Well, I think, I mean,

1065
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,120
what do you think I was letting you and
my men down if I did I stammered. No,

1066
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:01,390
I wouldn't. You've done your
job. I could get you a job.

1067
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:06,440
Get you a good job with us too. That's
some intelligence back in the rear. I,

1068
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,450
I think I want out.
I don't know if I can do this again.

1069
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:13,960
Maybe I can't cut it.
That's nonsense.

1070
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:16,810
You're a hell of a fine officer
and the men will understand,

1071
01:06:16,811 --> 01:06:20,290
but you think about it.
Okay. I will. Let me think.

1072
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,960
A little bit of confidence returned at
his words. I handed Yoders things to him.

1073
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,860
I wandered back to the pacs thinking I
should find Yoders pac bell had stood up

1074
01:06:33,581 --> 01:06:38,230
and was coming toward me. When he saw
the blind fold to dink in one motion,

1075
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,650
he swung his fist into the dinks face.
He hit him again and again,

1076
01:06:41,651 --> 01:06:45,790
knocking the surprise, dig down in a
burst of fury. Bell started kicking him.

1077
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,300
It was obvious.
Bell was going to kill him.

1078
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,930
The other men and I stood
smoking and watching.

1079
01:06:53,470 --> 01:06:55,420
We were going to let bill kill the dink.

1080
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:00,520
Bell had the right captain.
Sales yelled and ran over to us,

1081
01:07:00,521 --> 01:07:04,750
pushing me out of the way and pulling
bell off the Dick here. What's this?

1082
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,500
What's going on? We are not
going to have this in my company.

1083
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,390
This man's a prisoner lieutenant downs.
What are you doing? Just standing there.

1084
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,560
I looked at him in surprise.
Bell was killing this motherfucker.

1085
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:20,770
What's wrong with that? I
retorted. You know God damn well,

1086
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:24,730
what's the matter with that lieutenant?
This man is defenseless and our prisoner.

1087
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:27,940
Now let's get this
prisoner back to the LD Lz.

1088
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:32,620
I wanted the dink dead,
but the captain was right.

1089
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:38,970
So you can see there
obviously captain cells has a,

1090
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:42,820
has a great head on his shoulders
and there's something else at play.

1091
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:48,660
The other thing that's at play is that
by function of the way the battle went

1092
01:07:49,571 --> 01:07:54,571
down and by function of being one rank
above the platoon commanders that are in

1093
01:07:55,391 --> 01:07:59,290
the firefights,
guess what he is defacto.

1094
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:03,390
He's detached, he's detached.
He didn't, I mean bells,

1095
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,740
the guy was pinned down,
almost got killed, right?

1096
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:11,020
He's the guy that's emotional and guests
who pulled him out risked his life,

1097
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:15,340
lost Yoder. That was downs.
So these guys are emotional.

1098
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,160
They're there. They want to kill
this guy. They captured him. He's VC,

1099
01:08:19,190 --> 01:08:20,023
let's kill him.

1100
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:25,570
And captain cells is detached
because he wasn't in that firefight.

1101
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,720
He wasn't directly there.

1102
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:31,340
So he's able to maintain
enough mental detachment to,

1103
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:37,220
to make a hard decision,
but also hold the line.

1104
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:40,970
And this is something that, you know,
when we go through the meal, I'm massacre.

1105
01:08:40,971 --> 01:08:42,560
This could have happened
to over and over again,

1106
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:45,770
just going to happen to 80 anywhere along
the way. Someone could have said, hey,

1107
01:08:45,771 --> 01:08:48,230
what are you doing right
there? Stop. We don't do that.

1108
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:50,660
And that's exactly what sells does.

1109
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:55,940
And I think another thing that's that's
important from a leadership perspective

1110
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:58,520
is also,
well before I go to that point,

1111
01:08:58,820 --> 01:09:01,880
you notice that when he's
having a personal conversation
with lieutenant towns,

1112
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:02,714
he calls him Fred.

1113
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:07,010
But when he's screwing up and he
needs to kind of put him in his place,

1114
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,480
he's lieutenant downs

1115
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:14,540
on top of that from the
leadership perspective, from
captain sales perspective,

1116
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,960
he's got to always remember that w w
what is happening that they are emotional

1117
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:26,120
that they did just lose their
buddy that he's got. He can't just,

1118
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,730
you know, be so on the
straight and narrow that goes,

1119
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,840
oh I'm going to court martial you.

1120
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:33,050
He could call it or he could court Marshal
Bell, right? Hey you abused a prisoner,

1121
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,640
you're, you know, I'm
going to court martial you.

1122
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:39,590
And he doesn't do that
because he understands their
perspective and that's why

1123
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,590
you know, again, throughout this
book sells really impresses me as a,

1124
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:47,360
as a very squared away, good solid
leader as does downs. I mean downs.

1125
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:51,860
Obviously right here. He's emotional
and he's lost it. Uh, he's,

1126
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:56,750
he's crossed the line, right? But all
it takes is sales. Just telling him,

1127
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,000
get back over here, buddy.
You crossed the line,

1128
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:02,990
come back and he says the captain
was right. So that's all it took.

1129
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:07,340
Just a little snap just to get him to
detach a little bit from the emotions and,

1130
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,330
and move,
move away from the darkness.

1131
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:16,340
Back to the book,
I walked over to the bodies.

1132
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,750
Yoders eyes were partially shut and
I leaned down to push them clothes.

1133
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:24,860
Not that it did any good, but for some
reason I thought it was better that way.

1134
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:30,530
I stood there with one hand on my aching
hip smoking and thinking Yoders face

1135
01:10:30,531 --> 01:10:33,890
was all muddy from the numerous times
he'd been dropped in the mud and it was a

1136
01:10:33,891 --> 01:10:35,870
trickle of blood at
the base of his throat.

1137
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:43,040
This is the way it will always end.
I thought men being killed in the jungle,

1138
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,900
other men dragging their bodies out,

1139
01:10:44,901 --> 01:10:48,470
putting them on choppers and the rest
of us going back to the fighting.

1140
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:51,080
When they left on the chopper,

1141
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:56,300
it was as if they had never been man's
beginning and man's and would always be

1142
01:10:57,381 --> 01:10:59,630
attended by only a few.

1143
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,220
Those that bought them at birth
and those that bore him at death,

1144
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:08,240
the only important thing
was what he did in between,

1145
01:11:08,990 --> 01:11:11,300
good or bad or indifferent.

1146
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:16,290
He would touch those around
in some way and then be gone.

1147
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:22,410
I wondered if a solute would be an order,
not necessarily in the military sense,

1148
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,760
but a salute from one who had known
him and who would never forget him.

1149
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:32,690
I decided it was and I raised my
hand to my forehead in a farewell.

1150
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,273
Yeah.

1151
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,500
Now the birds coming in to pick them up
as after he gives that final salute to

1152
01:11:41,501 --> 01:11:42,334
Yoder.

1153
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:46,900
Smoke was popped and the large chopper
swung in towards us for is landing.

1154
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:50,650
The doors were pushed back and I saw
the door gunner on the side facing me

1155
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:55,600
looking around, anxiously searching for
the ominous, for the omnipresent enemy.

1156
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:59,290
Good man.
I fought not trusting a goddamn thing,

1157
01:11:59,291 --> 01:12:03,100
even with an American infantry companies
surrounding the Lz and I love, I love,

1158
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:07,930
just love that he's noticing
that this door gunners coming in,

1159
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:10,870
the he coming in to pick them up and
instead of this guy cutting corners and be

1160
01:12:10,871 --> 01:12:12,910
like, oh, there's him fucking Trump
again. There's no rounds being fired.

1161
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:16,180
I'm just gonna Relax. No, this guy's
in the game. Opens the door, doesn't,

1162
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:21,280
what does he say? He says, uh,
not trusting a God damn thing.

1163
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,620
Even with an American
infantry company on the LLC.

1164
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:32,240
Many thoughts were Chris costing my mind
above everything else ran the fought

1165
01:12:32,241 --> 01:12:34,130
that I could not abandoned my men.

1166
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:37,850
I felt the shame that I had asked
captain sales to pull me out of the field

1167
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:39,290
earlier when I was still shaking.

1168
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:44,930
What would demand think if they found
out I was doing such a thing worse?

1169
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,300
What would I think of myself?

1170
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:52,710
Yeah.

1171
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:57,540
Now they continue to do operations
and eventually they get,

1172
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:02,590
they get pulled out of the field on this
for the final time on a helicopter back

1173
01:13:04,921 --> 01:13:06,840
to the book,
the machine carried us away.

1174
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,830
I looked over my men sprawled
along the sides of the chopper.

1175
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,070
They'd removed the magazines from their
weapons before boarding and now we're

1176
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:18,210
holding them close to their bodies.
The men were dirty and unshaven.

1177
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:21,720
They're clothes in various stages
of disrepair. Jungle boots,

1178
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:24,660
worn and torn with clouds and mud.
Between the cleats,

1179
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,950
there were dark rings under their eyes
and their faces were drawn and tired.

1180
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:32,460
Some of those phases were
new men set ultra places.

1181
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,420
The faces that started the
operation in were racist.

1182
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,800
We had experienced the worst of
life and the most challenging.

1183
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:42,900
We had survived.

1184
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,600
The platoon I took back was not
the platoon I had brought out.

1185
01:13:53,680 --> 01:13:54,513
Yeah.

1186
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:00,930
Now they're on yet another
operation have to go back.

1187
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:04,080
They get reset and they're
out on another operation.

1188
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:05,423
Okay.

1189
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:10,150
Doing a patrol and him going back to the
book about five meters past the gate,

1190
01:14:10,151 --> 01:14:13,450
the two men turned me and waved
me forward all clear, sir.

1191
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,300
Let's go Rudo I pass through the gate.

1192
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:20,410
My right hand grasp my m 16
my left held my cigarette.

1193
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:23,020
I was humming the blue tail fly.

1194
01:14:23,021 --> 01:14:26,380
As I mentally ticked off the physicians
around the saddle where I would set my

1195
01:14:26,381 --> 01:14:30,640
men,
I noticed the time zero seven 45 hours,

1196
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:32,860
my foot slipped backwards,

1197
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:37,570
a fraction of an inch hitting
the trigger mechanism of a mine.

1198
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:43,450
I never heard the explosion.
Black powder and dirt flew by me.

1199
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:46,990
My eardrums ripped.
My body was flying through the air.

1200
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:50,500
I threw my arms in front of me in
a reflex motion to balance myself.

1201
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:55,120
My eyes registered the
horror of a brilliantly white
jagged bone sticking out of

1202
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:59,950
the stump of arm above where
my left elbow had been. Ragged.

1203
01:14:59,951 --> 01:15:02,290
Bloody flesh surrounded
this splintered bone.

1204
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:07,980
My mind cursed as utter helplessness in
disrepair and despair overwhelmed me on

1205
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:13,420
another part of my bodily Cooley
calculated what had caused the explosion.

1206
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,470
It had been a landmine, but what kind
would blow off my arm instead of my legs?

1207
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:22,330
Of course it had to be a bouncing Betty
mine that flies up to out of the ground

1208
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,080
after being tripped and explodes
to waist high. That would do it.

1209
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:30,880
My [inaudible] had been in my right hand.
The rifle was shattered.

1210
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:35,740
My hand was mangled. I stared in horror
at what remained of my right arm.

1211
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:40,780
The flesh had been ripped away
exposing two bones in my wife forearm.

1212
01:15:40,781 --> 01:15:45,640
From risks to the elbow, the bones look
like two white, glistening, narrow rods,

1213
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:50,230
buried and raw bloody meat
thinking. My God, my God,

1214
01:15:50,231 --> 01:15:54,250
my God, I felt told to feet of
my life as I landed on my feet,

1215
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:59,170
five yards from where the mind it
explode. It exploded. After landing.

1216
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:04,180
I staggered forward two or three steps
and then collapsed. My legs wouldn't work.

1217
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:08,470
The mind had gone off about six inches
from my left hip, from the waist down.

1218
01:16:08,471 --> 01:16:12,820
My body was mutilated and torn where
large chunks of flesh, muscles,

1219
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:16,660
blood vessels and nerves had been ripped
away by the hot, exploding shrapnel.

1220
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:19,390
My buttocks were blown away.

1221
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:22,780
The back of my legs were ripped
to the bone down to my heels.

1222
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:27,370
I rolled over on my back being careful
to keep my stump and right arm out of the

1223
01:16:27,371 --> 01:16:28,390
dirt and sand.

1224
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,740
My body was sending so many pain signals
to my brain that had overloaded like an

1225
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:36,670
electrical circuit. It caused
me to feel a racing, humming,

1226
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,500
numbness. I lifted my head
to view a scene from hell.

1227
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,490
I watched a couple of men run
by me to the wounded point man.

1228
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,660
They would only glance at me sideways as
I lay there holding my bloody stump in

1229
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:52,270
the air.
They seem nervous.

1230
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:55,090
Some of my men ran toward me.

1231
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:58,780
Then turn suddenly away at the sight
of my torn body. They stood near me,

1232
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:02,740
but hesitated to come too close as if
their movement through the air would make

1233
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:03,574
it worse.

1234
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,990
Spag asked me to turn sideways a little
bit so he could pull my gear off.

1235
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,560
There were tears is not Adam.

1236
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:13,460
His eyes as he worked
over me with a grunt,

1237
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,270
he pulled the belt out from under me.
Is there anything I can do for you?

1238
01:17:17,271 --> 01:17:20,990
SPAG asked. Yes. Run over there and
pick up my arm and bring it back to me.

1239
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,330
I don't want to leave it
in this stinking village.

1240
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:29,090
I told Marlene to get my squad leaders
go take care of the other men doc,

1241
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,983
they need you.

1242
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,070
I looked up Marlene and my squad leaders
were standing in a rough line along my

1243
01:17:34,071 --> 01:17:37,700
right side. I asked who was hurt.
I was feeling weaker and weaker.

1244
01:17:37,701 --> 01:17:41,150
It was so god damn cold.
As my body fought for life,

1245
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:43,160
my thoughts ran to my man and my platoon.

1246
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,860
I felt I was cheating them by
leaving them when they needed me.

1247
01:17:45,861 --> 01:17:48,800
Most when I joined,
the platoon is their leader.

1248
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:51,140
They had taught me the
ways to survive in combat.

1249
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,190
A second lieutenant who is new and
country and they were old timers,

1250
01:17:55,280 --> 01:18:00,140
18 1920 but old to the
ways of combat and deaf.

1251
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:04,340
As I gained experience and
confidence as a leader,

1252
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,450
I became an old timer having
to make decisions that put
me in the position I was

1253
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:11,900
in now wounded and maimed,
facing death.

1254
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:16,760
My men were still up there looking at me.
Despair on their faces.

1255
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,470
They're in vulnerable leader
had been brought down. Marley.

1256
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:25,910
Yes, sir. I want you to your men to
get the dink. Who planted that mine.

1257
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:30,710
I want him dead. Get Him. We will
want six. Don't you worry about that?

1258
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:33,800
They looked at each other.
Then back at me.

1259
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:39,440
The gray haze of the day was strong.
I pushed it back to look beyond my men.

1260
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:42,830
It was colder now and harder to see.

1261
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:47,660
I was thinking of my grandma downs and
her form of the woods and fields of

1262
01:18:47,661 --> 01:18:49,490
Indiana.
I love so much.

1263
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:53,090
If only I could walk them one more time.

1264
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:57,950
If I'm only 23 years old and I'm dying,
what a waste.

1265
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:03,110
There are so many things I had
meant to do and say, but I hadn't

1266
01:19:05,290 --> 01:19:06,970
now I will never get the chance.

1267
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:15,250
So
obviously,

1268
01:19:15,730 --> 01:19:20,140
although he thought he was gonna
die, he lived, he lost his arm. He,

1269
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:24,430
uh, ended up with, uh, with severe wounds,

1270
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:30,010
got discharged from the army. And you
know, it's one of the things in the story.

1271
01:19:30,011 --> 01:19:33,910
He had actually got picked up
for up for a pilot program.

1272
01:19:33,911 --> 01:19:36,010
So he's going to be a pilot in the army.

1273
01:19:36,011 --> 01:19:38,710
He was gonna stay in the army to become
a pilot and obviously that was gone

1274
01:19:38,711 --> 01:19:41,150
because he didn't have an arm anymore.
Uh,

1275
01:19:41,170 --> 01:19:45,370
luckily they were able to save his
other arm, but you know, severe wounds,

1276
01:19:45,371 --> 01:19:48,220
real long Rehab and

1277
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,270
eventually he ends up
going back to college.

1278
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,920
And here we go back to the book

1279
01:19:58,690 --> 01:20:03,610
in the fall of 1968 as I stopped at a
traffic light on my walk to class across

1280
01:20:03,611 --> 01:20:08,040
the campus of the University of Denver,
a man stepped up to me, said hi,

1281
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,280
without waiting for my
reply to his greeting.

1282
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:15,780
He pointed to the hook sticking out of
my left sleeve. Get that in Vietnam.

1283
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,800
I said, yeah, up near Tam,

1284
01:20:19,801 --> 01:20:23,160
Ky and one core serves you right.

1285
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:29,620
As the man walked away,

1286
01:20:29,621 --> 01:20:34,420
I stood rooted to confused with
her shame and anger to react.

1287
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:37,960
10 years of past the hurt,

1288
01:20:37,961 --> 01:20:41,050
shame and anger still flood
over me with the memory.

1289
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,450
But one thing I am certain,

1290
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:49,780
none of the men I knew who served in
Vietnam deserve to die or be maimed either

1291
01:20:49,781 --> 01:20:51,280
physically or mentally.

1292
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:57,510
I think it is necessary
now to give Vietnam to give
another view of Vietnam that

1293
01:20:58,001 --> 01:21:01,900
have the day to day life of
an infantry man on the ground.

1294
01:21:02,940 --> 01:21:05,530
I have always been asked
what I thought about Vietnam,

1295
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,560
but never what it was
like to fight in Vietnam.

1296
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,100
This is the way it was for us,

1297
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,600
but platoon of Delta one six

1298
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:29,120
in the afterward he talks
about why he wrote this book

1299
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,550
in writing the killing zone.
I had two goals.

1300
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:43,770
I wanted future young infantry lieutenants
and noncommissioned officers to learn

1301
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:45,960
from my experiences both good and bad.

1302
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:50,670
Some actions I took as a combat officer
had worked out well and some had not.

1303
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:53,340
The time had come to deal with both.

1304
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,670
Perhaps some would learn from my mistakes,

1305
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,280
especially the lessons that combat,

1306
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,090
especially the lesson that
combat does not go by the book.

1307
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:08,580
I also wanted to show future generations
that the American soldier in Vietnam

1308
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:09,810
was a good soldier.

1309
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:15,640
In 1978 the anti war anti military feeling
in the United States was pervasive in

1310
01:22:16,141 --> 01:22:20,280
the newspapers, on television among
writers and movies and in colleges.

1311
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:25,590
I had started college and
at the University of Denver
in the fall of 1968 while

1312
01:22:25,591 --> 01:22:28,020
I was still on active
duty in the military,

1313
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,930
the students for a democratic society,

1314
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,890
the weathermen and other antiwar groups
on campus targeted to anyone in the

1315
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:37,890
military as fair game for
their anti war stance.

1316
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:42,690
Such hostility was not pleasant
for me or other Vietnam veterans.

1317
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:46,050
It was hard to be denigrated
for serving your country.

1318
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:49,200
Many veterans have never admitted.

1319
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:52,650
Many veterans never admitted they were
in the service for many years after

1320
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:55,920
Vietnam,
angry at the antiwar faction.

1321
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:01,050
I wanted to set the record straight by
proving that the men I served with had

1322
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:04,110
fought and died with honor

1323
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:10,480
and here are the men

1324
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:15,490
that died and made the ultimate sacrifice

1325
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:18,143
for freedom

1326
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:24,100
and for their brothers in arms from
Delta Company. First Battalion. No,

01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,910
and second lieutenant John C.
Martin.

1343
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:56,423
So

1344
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:00,480
Fred downs.

1345
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,840
Second Lieutenant asked us to
do two things in this book.

1346
01:25:07,020 --> 01:25:10,230
First,
learn from his experiences,

1347
01:25:11,780 --> 01:25:15,600
the mistakes, the lessons,
and that is what we do here.

1348
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:21,310
We read and we study and
we think and we learn.

1349
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:28,340
Then the second thing he asked is that
we remember the man who fought and died

1350
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,713
with honor.

1351
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:38,460
Then that's something that we need to
do and we should continue to do each and

1352
01:25:39,751 --> 01:25:40,584
every day.

1353
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:43,073
Remember

1354
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:49,560
in that is one

1355
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,910
thing about this podcast

1356
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,120
that is a

1357
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:03,770
has a lot of meaning to me is the fact
that people are listening it and the

1358
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:08,150
memory of these types of men and
the challenges that they faced,

1359
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,160
it will be remembered.
They will be remembered

1360
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,283
always.

1361
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:30,813
So

1362
01:26:33,950 --> 01:26:38,390
once again,
the book is called the killing zone,

1363
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,440
my life and the Vietnam War
by Frederick downs. It's,

1364
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:47,600
it's a fantastic read. It's a
fantastic book. It's a fantastic,

1365
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:50,160
okay

1366
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:54,780
dedication and, and it's a, it
doesn't incredible job of honoring,

1367
01:26:55,020 --> 01:27:00,020
honoring these men that fought so hard
and are in a very unpopular war and

1368
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:07,080
by the book and read it. You will, you
will absolutely get a lot out of it.

1369
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:11,223
Echo Charles,

1370
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:19,030
I believe we can move on to the
next sector of this podcast.

1371
01:27:19,820 --> 01:27:22,570
And again,
um,

1372
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:27,440
if nothing else is delivered
through this podcast,

1373
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:31,280
you know,
let's let it be these couple things,

1374
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:36,790
these couple ideas of learning lessons
from other people's experiences in

1375
01:27:39,291 --> 01:27:42,680
remembering other people sacrifices.

1376
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:48,440
That's definitely one of the driving
forces behind my wheel to do this podcast.

1377
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:52,960
Okay?

1378
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:57,070
And we're going to keep doing the
podcast echo. Get me out of here. Please.

1379
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:01,610
Let me out of this situation over
there. I'm in that zone right now. Um,

1380
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:04,710
I need to send up a red star
cluster. You know what that is? So,

1381
01:28:04,730 --> 01:28:08,410
so in the military, when you need
help, it's a red star cluster. It's a,

1382
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,341
it's a flare.

1383
01:28:09,341 --> 01:28:12,760
You pop up and it means you couldn't
communicate with anybody and you need some

1384
01:28:12,761 --> 01:28:17,020
help. So there's my red star cluster. Do
you need to jump in and say, Hey Jocko,

1385
01:28:17,021 --> 01:28:21,790
speaking of the podcast, here's
how we can support it, you know,

1386
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:26,410
so talk about that while I go get over
here and get myself under control before

1387
01:28:26,411 --> 01:28:27,670
I start smashing things.

1388
01:28:28,290 --> 01:28:28,821
Uh,
yeah,

1389
01:28:28,821 --> 01:28:33,821
if you want to send any reinforcements
to support Jocko and end our podcasts

1390
01:28:33,831 --> 01:28:38,450
here while supporting yourself
with supplementation, by the way,

1391
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:43,400
good idea.
Go to on it.com/jocko so on.

1392
01:28:43,401 --> 01:28:47,870
It has like these supplements that
we take supplements for your joints,

1393
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:52,750
Krill oil, boom, shroom
tech for a performance.

1394
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:57,700
Hard stuff, you know, cross fit
Jujitsu if you're trying to go hard,

1395
01:28:57,701 --> 01:29:02,220
you know, hardcore in the paint.
Yeah, shroom tech boom. Um,

1396
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,450
also if you do your shopping at Amazon,

1397
01:29:07,890 --> 01:29:11,100
which I think we all do, um,
good click through our website.

1398
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,940
We have a little link there. Um, you
know, you can support it that way.

1399
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:19,170
That's a super easy way. All you gotta do
this, remember to do it before you shop.

1400
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,560
That is helpful. Yeah, very much so.

1401
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:25,650
We also have a new tool

1402
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:29,240
because can you, can you make them
remembering part a little bit easier?

1403
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,610
Yes. So when you know, you figure, Hey,

1404
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,970
I got to remember to go to the
website before I shop on Amazon.

1405
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,820
Sometimes I'm in a hurry,
whatever, you know, maybe I'm
thinking about other stuff.

1406
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:48,540
I'm not thinking about Jockos
podcast every single day. All Day.

1407
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:52,350
I got to buy some, you know, some
cleaners, some duct tape, whatever.

1408
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:58,650
Here's a way so you, it helps you remember
and or makes you not have to remember,

1409
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:03,390
know this little tool called the
trooper tool. Oh, jock podcast.

1410
01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:07,950
Super tool. Thanks to Brady for the Allen
Brady. It's, it's a cool little thing.

1411
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:11,390
It's like this small little thing is
pretty cool. He, you click on, there's,

1412
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,310
there's a little link on both websites.
So you click on the thing,

1413
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,350
it asks you if you want it,
you click yes,

1414
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:22,070
puts a little icon there on your
browser and it basically direct to the,

1415
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:26,610
to the affiliate Amazon
link automatically.

1416
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,320
You don't gotta think it's dope.

1417
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,510
That's a really easy way to
support the podcast. Yeah.

1418
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,370
The,
the,

1419
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,480
it doesn't cost you anything.
Yeah. It cost to Amazon something.

1420
01:30:38,481 --> 01:30:42,050
And it seems to me like Amazon can afford
to kick a little bit to the podcast

1421
01:30:42,051 --> 01:30:43,580
over here. Right? Yeah.

1422
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:47,270
And it does serve its purpose because
you don't have something, you know,

1423
01:30:47,271 --> 01:30:50,900
like Amazon, they're, you know, they're
a good company, provides good stuff,

1424
01:30:50,901 --> 01:30:54,200
good service and all that. And they're
trying to get the word out and you know,

1425
01:30:54,201 --> 01:30:58,350
they'd be partner with people who,
who can get the word out. Yeah.

1426
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,230
There's people that are going
to go, oh, you know what?

1427
01:31:00,231 --> 01:31:03,350
I want to support the podcast so I will
buy this instead of buying it through

1428
01:31:03,351 --> 01:31:04,400
some other website,

1429
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,940
they're going to go to the store that's
going to support something that they

1430
01:31:07,941 --> 01:31:11,840
enjoy or something that they get value
out of, hopefully from this podcast.

1431
01:31:11,841 --> 01:31:15,320
So yeah, that's an awesome way to support.
We appreciate it and it makes it like,

1432
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:16,390
it's kind of this little tool.

1433
01:31:16,391 --> 01:31:19,130
It's kind of cool because it kind of makes
it official. You know, like if you're,

1434
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:24,260
I mean if you're one of the people that
listen to this and really talk with us

1435
01:31:24,261 --> 01:31:27,680
and stuff, it's a, it is a cool way to
kind of be more part of the it group,

1436
01:31:27,681 --> 01:31:30,680
I guess. It seems like it, when I
put mine up there I'm like, Hey,

1437
01:31:30,681 --> 01:31:33,060
you know I'm like a fish. I
don't know. It felt weird. Again,

1438
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:36,340
Echo Charles is in the game. We
did that. So it was cool. Yeah,

1439
01:31:36,530 --> 01:31:39,380
it's a really cool tool. You
don't have to, it's safe.

1440
01:31:39,381 --> 01:31:42,860
It's not like you just put it on if
you don't want it on there anymore for

1441
01:31:42,861 --> 01:31:45,290
whatever reason.
Right click it right click and it,

1442
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,340
cause she made a little video that
shows you go to the Jocko podcast,

1443
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,410
youtube channel and Echo Charles made a
video of very high speed instructional

1444
01:31:54,411 --> 01:31:58,400
video on how to do this. Trying to
waste anybody's time. It's really easy.

1445
01:31:58,401 --> 01:32:00,400
You are not around with
the instructional video.

1446
01:32:00,401 --> 01:32:04,780
I think that was very
impressive. And, and by the way,

1447
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:08,230
subscribe,
do me a favor troopers.

1448
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:12,550
Subscribe to the Youtube Channel,
the Jocko podcast, youtube channel.

1449
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,980
That way when Echo,
cause I'm been,

1450
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:19,270
I've been to hacking on echo to make
little outtakes and other little

1451
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:21,900
conversations and videos and
he's like, well you know, we,

1452
01:32:21,901 --> 01:32:23,770
we got some subscribers
but maybe you know,

1453
01:32:23,830 --> 01:32:27,340
if we had some more maybe I'd be more so
we need to motivate Echo Charles just a

1454
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:31,270
little bit because so we
could get some outtake videos,

1455
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:33,580
some other other interesting videos.

1456
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:36,850
I wanted to do a little pre video today
of what it was like when we were getting

1457
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:40,630
set up because we have a little ritual
that we go through when we're making some,

1458
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:45,700
some beverages, you know, some, some
Alpha brainy and we have, you know,

1459
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:48,280
so I was like, I'd be pretty cool if
you shot a little video. And he's like,

1460
01:32:48,281 --> 01:32:52,990
well you know, maybe one day, no,

1461
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:57,870
I actually am imitating. So subscribe
to the, I don't think, if it doesn't,

1462
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:01,120
I mean it's just, just go to, go to
the Jocko podcast channel on Youtube,

1463
01:33:01,180 --> 01:33:04,150
subscribe at youtube.com/chocolate pie.

1464
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,520
And also what's cool about
that is when you do that,

1465
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:08,110
then you get little emails that say,

1466
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:10,360
it's not like you just
get an email and says,

1467
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:14,770
hey Jocko podcasts just uploaded a new
video. I get those. And I'm always like,

1468
01:33:14,771 --> 01:33:18,700
oh yeah, cool. Now I can watch the
video and even that's option. Oh okay.

1469
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,720
If you don't opt out. But yeah,
that's a good, I have, um,

1470
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:27,550
remember that that one,
a cha children's book idea I had.

1471
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:30,520
Yeah. You probably forget cause
you know, you need to remind me,

1472
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:33,910
I got a lot of ideas that I had that
on video when we were talking anyway.

1473
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:36,370
Oh yeah, that'd be funny. Yeah. So yeah,

1474
01:33:36,371 --> 01:33:38,350
I'm going to pull some of some
things you've got understand.

1475
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,350
So I have a certain standards,
I'm talking not talking to you,

1476
01:33:41,351 --> 01:33:43,870
echo and talking to people
that are listening right
now. I mean you're here too.

1477
01:33:43,871 --> 01:33:44,800
So I guess I'm talking to you too,

1478
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:50,130
but people got to understand that there's
a certain expectation in my mind of

1479
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:52,840
what the podcast is and
what it's supposed to be.

1480
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:57,880
So when something happens
that's not quite there,

1481
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:00,880
I'm like, you know what, I
don't really, hey, you know,

1482
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:04,660
I don't want to talk about that on the
podcast. But it's like, for instance,

1483
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,590
before we hit record, we're
recording, but before we go,

1484
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:11,980
before I opened the show, we're
talking about something, right?

1485
01:34:11,981 --> 01:34:15,910
We're always talking about something
and sometimes those conversations are 20

1486
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:18,940
minutes, half an hour. We're
talking about real stuff,

1487
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:23,890
we're talking about legit things. But we
haven't even introduced the podcast yet.

1488
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:27,400
So that goes into scrap pile right now.
Some of the scrap metal material,

1489
01:34:27,610 --> 01:34:31,840
while it might not be in March,

1490
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:34,900
marching step with what the podcast is,

1491
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,940
it does perhaps have a, have a life
that it could live and it could,

1492
01:34:39,941 --> 01:34:42,490
it could guide people in a certain way
and it's stuff that people might be

1493
01:34:42,491 --> 01:34:43,324
interested in.

1494
01:34:43,630 --> 01:34:47,960
So that could be youtube download,
you know,

1495
01:34:48,070 --> 01:34:49,140
youtube just posted on there.

1496
01:34:49,141 --> 01:34:51,910
So that way people get a little taste
of other things around the podcast,

1497
01:34:51,911 --> 01:34:56,480
which I think people would dick. Yeah,
yeah, that makes sense. So like, you know,

1498
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:01,310
if you free, you buy an Echo Charles,
free your mind. You're totally right.

1499
01:35:01,550 --> 01:35:06,150
I'm the thank you. Thank
you once for once. Yeah.

1500
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:11,090
Yeah. Cause you know if you listened
to it on iTunes you're like,

1501
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:15,110
why am I going to sit and watch? And
Josh would talk to each other. You know,

1502
01:35:15,170 --> 01:35:17,420
I listened to one and I got
to look at them too. You know,

1503
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:20,590
a lot of people might not be interested
in that really. There's some moments,

1504
01:35:20,760 --> 01:35:21,740
you know what I do is I,

1505
01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:26,330
well I watched certain moments
of the podcast on Youtube.

1506
01:35:26,570 --> 01:35:30,260
Yeah. Like when I know I was
feeling intense about something,

1507
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:33,290
I go and see what it, see what
that looks like. So like, okay,

1508
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,410
what does that look like when I'm
feeling that? Does it look like,

1509
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:41,330
does it look like from the outside,
what it feels like from the inside?

1510
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,760
Because even today I was
getting pretty fired up. Like,

1511
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:48,230
I mean you're talking about
heroes and young man, man,

1512
01:35:48,231 --> 01:35:52,340
18 1920 years old that said,
okay,

1513
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:57,080
this unpopular war. I'll go fight
it. I'll go fight it. You know,

1514
01:35:57,081 --> 01:36:01,310
I'll go rest of my life, I'll go out
there in the jungle and live in, you know,

1515
01:36:01,311 --> 01:36:06,100
I was, I was, uh, out this week
in the field, right. Camping. I,

1516
01:36:06,120 --> 01:36:08,150
I kept putting it in quotes on Twitter.

1517
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:11,090
I was putting in quotes because I was
like, I can't call this the field,

1518
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:16,010
but you know, it wasn't the comfort
of a house, right. It was, it was,

1519
01:36:16,090 --> 01:36:19,970
and it was, you know, bugs and ants and,
and I'm like thinking to myself, you know,

1520
01:36:21,500 --> 01:36:23,780
this is nothing. And I
was thinking back to, uh,

1521
01:36:24,050 --> 01:36:29,050
to the forgotten Highlander and remember
the bugs were just eating those guys

1522
01:36:29,841 --> 01:36:32,900
alive and you know,
you just,

1523
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:38,660
you just can't, you can't
compare. So these guys that,

1524
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:43,220
that just stepped up
fought and I just wanna

1525
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:48,530
I just wanna always, you know, that
kind of thing will get me fired up.

1526
01:36:48,531 --> 01:36:51,390
So when I go back to the videos
sometimes, like, oh man, what,

1527
01:36:51,391 --> 01:36:53,180
what was I looking like,
you know,

1528
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:57,560
a little self assessment and I wonder if,
you know,

1529
01:36:57,561 --> 01:37:00,530
cause when I'm feeling that way, I'm like,
okay, you got to detach a little bit.

1530
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:01,480
Cause you're starting to
get a little bit fired.

1531
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:04,820
I'm gonna start breaking them and start
getting them like really emotional about

1532
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:07,100
something. And so I got to, I
got a little red flag goes up,

1533
01:37:07,101 --> 01:37:08,720
I go to you going to back
off a little bit here.

1534
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:12,350
We don't have to edit the
video and if I break down,

1535
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,800
so I got to just back off and
sometimes I got to see you.

1536
01:37:15,801 --> 01:37:19,160
What does that look like? Does it look,
can you tell? Am I looking? You know,

1537
01:37:19,161 --> 01:37:22,100
so that's the kind of thing that I
like to go back and look at the youtube

1538
01:37:22,101 --> 01:37:25,400
videos and say, you know,
what does this, what does this
look like? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1539
01:37:25,401 --> 01:37:29,210
There's some value. There was a lot of
value on youtube. We're probably not,

1540
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:33,710
you know, capitalizing, I dunno,
whatever. For people who care.

1541
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:37,340
And it's weird too because the interesting
thing about all this is you used the

1542
01:37:37,341 --> 01:37:38,600
word capitalized,
right?

1543
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:43,040
In the fact of the matter is we aren't
really capitalizing on this at all.

1544
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:48,100
And I keep getting told by a variety of
different people what to do to you to do

1545
01:37:49,071 --> 01:37:52,570
what? That right there to
capitalize. Just capitalize,

1546
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:56,250
not for us to come and I know
everybody, you know, but what we,

1547
01:37:56,280 --> 01:38:01,280
what would you want to do is we want to
maximize the effort that we put in here.

1548
01:38:02,370 --> 01:38:05,040
Want to maximize it so that people
get the most out of it. That's,

1549
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:06,420
that's what I know.
That's what you meant.

1550
01:38:06,450 --> 01:38:10,230
I know you didn't mean like let's run to
the cash machine because we're doing it

1551
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:11,430
for the passion of doing it.

1552
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:14,880
That's what I'm sitting here
for sitting here so I can tell.

1553
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,740
So I can tell this story right here
about these guys and I know, you know,

1554
01:38:19,741 --> 01:38:21,570
I know,
I hear from all kinds of cops.

1555
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,720
I hear from my seal buddies that are
still in, that are listening to it,

1556
01:38:24,721 --> 01:38:28,020
that are asking me, texting me questions
going, hey man, what's going on with us?

1557
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:29,640
Hey, what would you have
done differently here? Hey,

1558
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:31,050
those are my buddies that are in,

1559
01:38:31,051 --> 01:38:33,120
that are getting ready to
deploy overseas right now.

1560
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:37,680
And I get texts and emails and Twitter
things from guys that were guys that are

1561
01:38:37,681 --> 01:38:40,260
active duty in the Marine
Corps and the army.

1562
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:44,610
So I know that we're getting the
word out there and that's what,

1563
01:38:44,640 --> 01:38:49,290
that's where I'm sitting here for.
So you make a good point with,

1564
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,560
you know, there's a lot of people who
don't watch the video. Of course. I mean,

1565
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:57,530
I don't watch podcasts
videos, right? I mean, why?

1566
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:01,380
The reason podcasts are so convenient
that you can be doing something else.

1567
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,860
You don't have to dedicate, you have
to dedicate your all your senses to it.

1568
01:39:04,890 --> 01:39:06,570
You only have to dedicate two of them,

1569
01:39:06,750 --> 01:39:10,170
your ears and your brain because you
don't have to dedicate your eyes.

1570
01:39:10,171 --> 01:39:12,950
You don't have to dedicate your asked to
sit down and share and watch something.

1571
01:39:12,970 --> 01:39:15,840
You can walk around, you can
do yard work, you can drive,

1572
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:16,860
you can do what you gotta do.

1573
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,570
But I think the shorter little youtube
clips where you go, hey, check this out.

1574
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:26,040
This is when Jocko and I were discussing
a kids book that echo was talking about,

1575
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:29,560
or yeah, I'm going to post.
Yeah. Post that thing though.

1576
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:33,480
And it's interesting cause a
lot of people apparently don't.

1577
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:37,450
I mean don't are surprised that I looked
different than I sat on a pair I guess.

1578
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,980
Oh yeah. They think you're a skinny
white hipster or that's what they think.

1579
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:45,600
Maybe I am at heart. Maybe you
are at heart, you're just trapped.

1580
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:50,630
Maybe you identify as a
skinny white hipster even
though you're a 227 a I don't,

1581
01:39:53,550 --> 01:39:56,880
I don't identify myself by
my physical characteristics.

1582
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:01,690
It's what's in my heart and my mind. The
content of your character, like to say,

1583
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:06,570
think the youtube. I just,
good idea. Yeah. We'll post
more. So I have a lot to men.

1584
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:08,100
So many outtakes a lot.

1585
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:13,770
You've done something really good
outtake videos in the past. Yeah. Yeah.

1586
01:40:13,771 --> 01:40:17,880
They're pretty, yeah, from when we were
filming commercials and stuff. Yeah,

1587
01:40:17,881 --> 01:40:20,850
those are good. All right.
Anything else? Jack?

1588
01:40:20,851 --> 01:40:24,240
Can you in chocolate store?
Did you talk about that? Yes.

1589
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,370
Go to the store to buy
some Bryce and merchandise.

1590
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,460
Somebody who hit me up on Twitter
the other day and they're like, hey,

1591
01:40:29,461 --> 01:40:33,080
you should set up a, we've got asked this
a bunch of times, set up a Patrick on,

1592
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:35,190
is that what it's called?
Patriarchy. Patriarchy,

1593
01:40:35,490 --> 01:40:38,970
where you can donate to the podcast
certain amount. And I just said, hey man,

1594
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:42,270
go buy a tee shirt. You know,
that supports us just as well.

1595
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:45,600
And you get a t shirt and just that's a
good way to support the podcast by buy

1596
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:49,850
some merchandise. Buy some gear. Yeah,
the chocolate store. That's a good one.

1597
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:52,730
Tee shirts, coffee amongst stickers.
Those are kind of cool. Um,

1598
01:40:53,530 --> 01:40:58,530
one of my friends saw to
Jacqueline stickers in the
wild in the wild one day or

1599
01:40:59,251 --> 01:41:03,070
maybe one location here at San Diego.
Everyone in San Diego,

1600
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:05,930
we know everyone in San Diego
doesn't count. I Dunno. Yeah.

1601
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:10,750
Cleveland counts.
But yeah.

1602
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:12,270
Awesome. Good. Yup.

1603
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:17,670
So now we get to those
questions from the inner webs.

1604
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
First Question Jocko is the minimal
amount of competent defensive ability

1605
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:30,883
defense,

1606
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:36,300
essentially the most overlooked essential
stabilizer of young male psyche.

1607
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:42,760
So this question, this actually, this
actually came across the interwebs as a,

1608
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:45,850
as a statement,
an opinion.

1609
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:49,570
And I kind of rephrased it just a
little bit to make it into a question,

1610
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,550
but it actually came across
someone and saying, look,

1611
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:55,570
he believes this person believes
that the no one had a fight,

1612
01:41:56,890 --> 01:42:01,420
no competent defensive, defensive ability.
I call that knowing how to fight is,

1613
01:42:01,690 --> 01:42:05,920
and he thinks it's the most essential
stabilizer of a young male psyche.

1614
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:11,320
I agree with this statement.
I think that, yeah,

1615
01:42:11,321 --> 01:42:12,040
I completely agree.

1616
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:17,040
I think that learning how to fight and
knowing how to fight gives you real

1617
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:23,340
confidence and security, not just
in the form of being secure, but as,

1618
01:42:23,341 --> 01:42:27,520
as in in opposition to insecurity.
Right.

1619
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:29,560
Because when you know how to fight,

1620
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,910
all of a sudden you don't have anything
to prove anymore. Yeah. And we,

1621
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:35,680
this change is so I,
you know,

1622
01:42:35,710 --> 01:42:38,330
I wish I would have learned how
to fight and I'm watching. Sure.

1623
01:42:38,331 --> 01:42:41,320
We fought all the time. When I was a kid,
we fought, we didn't know how to fight.

1624
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,600
So what do we have to prove
that we knew how to fight.

1625
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:46,660
If we actually knew how to fight, we
wouldn't have to prove that all the time.

1626
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:51,990
So I absolutely agree with us and that's
why I'm constantly trying to get people

1627
01:42:53,080 --> 01:42:56,440
to get into Jujitsu. You know, get
your kids in. Did you get your,

1628
01:42:56,441 --> 01:43:01,030
get your 13 year old boy, your 10
year old boy. Get him into Jujitsu.

1629
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,080
Your girl too.

1630
01:43:02,200 --> 01:43:06,100
I mean your girl too because your
girl is gonna use it for defense. Um,

1631
01:43:07,150 --> 01:43:12,150
girls don't have the constant
tension of fighting that guys have.

1632
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:16,240
It is part of who we are.
When I shake someone's hand,

1633
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,830
I don't care what kind of mood I'm in.
I am thinking about taking them down.

1634
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:22,990
I am thinking about what I'm
gonna do to him in a fight.

1635
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:25,390
It doesn't matter if
I'm meeting Santa Claus,

1636
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:28,420
I'm thinking about doing a double leg.
I'm thinking about what,

1637
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,450
what his weight his, does he have
cauliflower ear? That's what I'm doing.

1638
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:36,430
And guys do that, guys do that.
And it's real. And I mean,

1639
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:38,590
especially in the environment
I grew up in the seal teams.

1640
01:43:38,591 --> 01:43:40,750
I mean everybody's got that constant

1641
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,390
like test evaluates the evaluation,
you know?

1642
01:43:46,780 --> 01:43:49,210
So if you don't know how to fight,

1643
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:52,100
there's only one way to figure
out where you are and that

1644
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:55,820
is to fight know.
And so you end up doing stupid things,

1645
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:59,990
stupid things to prove your,
your manhood.

1646
01:43:59,991 --> 01:44:00,890
And I hate to use that word,

1647
01:44:00,891 --> 01:44:02,720
but you end up doing stupid
things to prove your manhood.

1648
01:44:03,110 --> 01:44:07,520
So my recommendation is, well, I
totally agree with this statement.

1649
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,980
I think it is a huge stabilizer of,

1650
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:14,390
of your personality and,

1651
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:18,890
and your psyche as a man. So teach,
get those kids to learn Jujitsu.

1652
01:44:18,980 --> 01:44:23,980
They're going to understand the things
you understand violence you respected

1653
01:44:24,640 --> 01:44:27,320
because you know where you've got
choked out. You know it's happened.

1654
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:29,600
You know that is a horrible feeling.

1655
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,080
It's a horrible feeling when another human
being can't control you 100% you know

1656
01:44:36,321 --> 01:44:40,790
what? Physically, it doesn't matter
how smart you are anymore. I'm sorry.

1657
01:44:40,791 --> 01:44:44,530
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It
doesn't matter how smart you are anymore.

1658
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:48,470
When you are getting completely
physically dominated by someone,

1659
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:51,860
it doesn't matter that you're
smarter than them at that time.

1660
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:52,730
There's nothing you can do about it.

1661
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:56,220
What are you gonna Challenge them to a
spelling bee. It's not going to help you.

1662
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:00,500
You're, you're under their control. And
that's a horrible, horrible feeling.

1663
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,430
And so I think it's a, you know, and I
felt that, you know, when I was a kid,

1664
01:45:04,460 --> 01:45:06,650
you know, I got bullied just like
everybody, everybody gets bullied.

1665
01:45:06,651 --> 01:45:09,410
It's at a certain point, you
know, you show up to high
school, you're 13 years old.

1666
01:45:09,411 --> 01:45:13,390
I was 30 I was a young, whatever,
however that works when you are born.

1667
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:16,880
That was born in September.
So I was a young,

1668
01:45:16,881 --> 01:45:21,881
scrawny kid and I didn't get
bullied to some crazy extent,

1669
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:24,500
but you get picked on,
you get picked on,

1670
01:45:24,501 --> 01:45:27,440
you get in little scuffles and you
get thrown around by a kid that's,

1671
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:31,160
that reached puberty when he
was nine and he's now, you know,

1672
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:36,280
six feet to 20 and I'm showing up at
school 13 years old way and a buck 45

1673
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:41,660
you're going to get, you're going to get
physically controlled and it's not fun.

1674
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:45,800
And so I didn't know how to fight.

1675
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:48,560
I was trying to figure it out.
And there was no,

1676
01:45:48,561 --> 01:45:52,410
no one knew how to fight back then unless
you were a boxer, maybe a wrestler. Um,

1677
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:57,230
but yeah, so definitely this is a
huge piece. Helps you with I think,

1678
01:45:57,231 --> 01:46:01,160
I think kids that know how to fight
are going to get an a lost less street

1679
01:46:01,161 --> 01:46:01,461
fights.

1680
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:05,270
They're going to do a lot less stupid
things to prove themselves because guess

1681
01:46:05,271 --> 01:46:09,590
what?
They already have the essential primal,

1682
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:14,180
animalistic characteristic
of physical domination.

1683
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:16,310
And that goes a long way.
Yeah.

1684
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:19,900
And we talked about this before,
back to the the girls thing,

1685
01:46:19,990 --> 01:46:21,280
getting your girls into it.

1686
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:26,860
You know how when you get into
any kind of physical situation,

1687
01:46:26,861 --> 01:46:29,650
even if you're in a crowd and
someone starts shoving someone else,

1688
01:46:29,680 --> 01:46:31,060
not even you and pull him,

1689
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:34,810
you feel the force of somebody or
someone's just all like on you.

1690
01:46:34,811 --> 01:46:37,510
Or even if someone like, I don't know,
tackles you or something like that.

1691
01:46:37,511 --> 01:46:40,930
It's like this kind of
imposed physical situation.

1692
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:43,700
And when you're into Jujitsu,
that's every day.

1693
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,830
So you get used to that real quick and
in fact you get real comfortable with it.

1694
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,010
But as a girl,
not trying to like

1695
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,960
win fight, now you know,
I know what you did,

1696
01:46:51,961 --> 01:46:53,580
so I'm going to trade when
fights and beat up guys.

1697
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:57,930
That's not really what it's for for girls.
It's more for knowing how to function,

1698
01:46:57,931 --> 01:47:01,320
knowing where to be, where not to
be. Because man, if you don't know,

1699
01:47:01,321 --> 01:47:02,490
you just simply don't know.

1700
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:06,630
And also being totally right and
then also being inoculated to the,

1701
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:11,580
the physical comedy when it
happens. So you can't win. I mean,

1702
01:47:11,581 --> 01:47:13,870
not looking to win fights.
There's go watch youtube. Yeah,

1703
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:18,450
there's all kinds of videos of girls
and just working over guys and I mean in

1704
01:47:18,451 --> 01:47:22,140
street fights there's one particular
where this girl's just triangle.

1705
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,890
Our mock just choke. Just
crushing this kid. Yeah. Well the,

1706
01:47:25,891 --> 01:47:30,240
I mean the truth is if you learned,
you did. If someone knows Jesus,

1707
01:47:30,241 --> 01:47:31,170
someone doesn't,

1708
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:34,770
the the chance of the person knowing you
did to winning the fight is very, very,

1709
01:47:34,771 --> 01:47:38,010
very high. Even if you're a
girl, it's still applies to you.

1710
01:47:38,011 --> 01:47:40,800
Of course the girls that have physical
diff disadvantage because she's smaller,

1711
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:42,660
weaker, whatever. But like I said,

1712
01:47:42,750 --> 01:47:46,630
Jujitsu is just this huge jump in,
you know,

1713
01:47:46,740 --> 01:47:51,740
ability as far as fights go and you know
something else from a pure self defense

1714
01:47:51,871 --> 01:47:55,320
perspective, if you, a lot of times,

1715
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:57,660
let's say a girl's not able to physically,

1716
01:47:57,661 --> 01:48:01,920
let's say she's a hundred pounds and
she's a guy attacks or that's 200 pounds,

1717
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:06,900
she might not be able to put him to sleep.
She might not be able to finish him,

1718
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:10,110
but she may able to be able to survive.

1719
01:48:10,200 --> 01:48:15,130
Fend the guy off for a minute and 30
seconds instead of two seconds. Yup.

1720
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:17,460
Instead of four seconds
instead of eight seconds.

1721
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:20,190
So that's what it takes for someone
to hear, for someone to see.

1722
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,190
So every second counts.
And if you know you did too,

1723
01:48:23,191 --> 01:48:26,250
I guarantee you it's,

1724
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:29,290
it's really hard to subdue
somebody that knows some Jujitsu.

1725
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:30,121
If you don't know anything,

1726
01:48:30,121 --> 01:48:33,740
you are going to have a hard time
getting control them. They're going to,

1727
01:48:33,870 --> 01:48:35,550
they're going to be,
and even if you're stronger than them,

1728
01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:38,850
you'll be able to get ahold of the, maybe
eventually if there are a lot smaller,

1729
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:41,520
a lot weaker than you, but it's going
to be a fight. And a lot of, a lot of,

1730
01:48:41,521 --> 01:48:44,010
you know, you read a lot of stories
when in self defense situations,

1731
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:48,170
if the girl puts up a decent fight,
the guy's not going to have any of it.

1732
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:50,280
You know, he's going to realize
that he's not looking for that.

1733
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:52,410
He's not looking for a fight,
he's looking for something else.

1734
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:57,210
And so the fight begins, he backs off.
So yeah, absolutely. It applies for,

1735
01:48:57,270 --> 01:49:01,310
for girls as well. And there's just a
certain level of confidence, you know,

1736
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:04,350
and I've seen that, you know, my
son's had a couple of little scuffles,

1737
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,340
a couple that I've witnessed
to where, uh, you know,

1738
01:49:08,370 --> 01:49:10,440
he just was like not trying to,

1739
01:49:10,770 --> 01:49:14,340
not trying to have a problem until someone
just grabs him and is obviously going

1740
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:16,950
to do, try and do something to them and
then that person's getting launched.

1741
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:20,280
You know, like a perfect judo
cause you're going to, you know,

1742
01:49:20,281 --> 01:49:23,290
how hard is it to judo? Throw somebody
that doesn't know any judo, Jujitsu,

1743
01:49:23,310 --> 01:49:27,810
it's so easy. So you see a kid fly through
the air, hit the ground, you see my son,

1744
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:28,081
you know,

1745
01:49:28,081 --> 01:49:30,870
just like there's no guard passing
because the person has even know what the

1746
01:49:30,871 --> 01:49:34,350
part is there. So it's just straight to
mountain. And then once you're in mount,

1747
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:36,640
the person has no idea
what's happening and,

1748
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:39,390
and they're completely controlled and
they're getting put to sleep. That's it.

1749
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:42,060
It's as easy as that.
Yeah. And so funny how you,

1750
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:47,010
this is kind of the part that I forget
actually every once in a while where,

1751
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,010
how you brought up,

1752
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,860
when you shake someone's hand, you're
always thinking about it or whatever.

1753
01:49:51,070 --> 01:49:53,020
So that's, that's the
thing too. That's why,

1754
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:56,980
that's why it's almost like if you don't
know what you did to like or are for

1755
01:49:56,981 --> 01:49:59,860
real fighting's not many out there man.
There's not many.

1756
01:49:59,861 --> 01:50:02,130
But even we'll just say
if you don't know Jujitsu,

1757
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:06,460
you might fall into this trap by thinking,
well you know, I might, you know,

1758
01:50:06,461 --> 01:50:06,971
you never know.

1759
01:50:06,971 --> 01:50:10,420
He's not on all the time or he might
not be ready for this or you know,

1760
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:14,110
all surprise them with a like does punch
or something like this and they'll,

1761
01:50:14,111 --> 01:50:15,700
they won't give it its due credit.

1762
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:19,330
But the thing is when you learned Jujitsu
Bruh, that's all you're thinking about.

1763
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:23,710
You're like, Oh fuck, take this guy
right here. 100% of the time you,

1764
01:50:23,711 --> 01:50:27,070
you can be laying in your, in your
bed with your wife and she'll be like,

1765
01:50:27,071 --> 01:50:31,390
hey give me a hug. And you're like under
hook there. Yes, exactly. The whole time.

1766
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:35,930
So you can't really to surprise the
guy who knows Jujitsu to surprise them.

1767
01:50:35,931 --> 01:50:39,730
It's super hard. Like you gotta
do from behind. I don't know.

1768
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:42,820
Even if you think up for me, I like, you
know what to do from beginning, you know,

1769
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:45,360
you gotta like I dunno hit
him or something really hard,

1770
01:50:45,390 --> 01:50:48,670
knock them out one punch or something
like that to knock somebody out.

1771
01:50:49,610 --> 01:50:53,830
So yeah, but that's so funny
cause that, that is how it is.

1772
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:57,370
Even as like a, like a high
level guy, you're still like,

1773
01:50:57,970 --> 01:50:59,440
it's always on your mind.

1774
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:03,160
Like it's like you're walking around
with this big powerful like gun or

1775
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:05,500
something. Like you're like,
okay, who wants to get shot?

1776
01:51:05,710 --> 01:51:07,840
Not that you want to
shoot people specifically,

1777
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:12,130
but it's like this radar that's like,
okay, who wants to get shot kind of thing.

1778
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:15,000
Cause you're just rates ready. You
know, you're just ready to do the time.

1779
01:51:15,430 --> 01:51:19,900
And to me honestly, it's so
instinctive. You know, at this point,

1780
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:25,790
part of every movement that you make is
thinking about that and your, you know,

1781
01:51:25,791 --> 01:51:28,960
you ever had somebody that doesn't know
what you did to like maybe you haven't

1782
01:51:28,961 --> 01:51:29,770
seen someone in awhile.

1783
01:51:29,770 --> 01:51:34,600
I've had that half what I've seen someone
for awhile and I mean 20 years so they

1784
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:35,800
have no idea what Jujitsu is.

1785
01:51:35,801 --> 01:51:39,250
We've gone a completely different paths
in our lives and they like grab a hold

1786
01:51:39,251 --> 01:51:43,010
of you as if it was the old days and
you're going to have a tussle and it's

1787
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:47,110
edible. It's just a, it's
just a four second, you know,

1788
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:52,240
Spirit crushing maneuver of death and,
and you're happy to do it too,

1789
01:51:52,241 --> 01:51:54,070
you know,
cause as an adult like you know,

1790
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:57,970
I think anywhere past 26 27 years old,

1791
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:01,930
it's hard to get away with like getting
into a wrestling match in public or you

1792
01:52:01,931 --> 01:52:04,480
know, somewhere outside of
the math. That's interesting.

1793
01:52:05,190 --> 01:52:09,150
You might not have known
that, but I don't know.

1794
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:11,500
I think I speak for more than
more people than just myself,

1795
01:52:11,501 --> 01:52:13,660
but there's a part of your
mind that kind of helps it.

1796
01:52:13,810 --> 01:52:18,120
It happens just with your
friend, you know, or something
like that. Just always on.

1797
01:52:18,130 --> 01:52:21,790
You're always hoping for for a
scrap. You know what? Ironically,

1798
01:52:22,270 --> 01:52:24,070
back to the part where,
where I was saying, um,

1799
01:52:24,071 --> 01:52:26,650
it's Kinda hard to surprise
that you did to guy. Ironically,

1800
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:30,550
the easiest time to surprise
the Jujitsu guy is on the mat.

1801
01:52:30,640 --> 01:52:33,610
If you're another Jujitsu guy, what
do you do is you play like, oh,

1802
01:52:33,611 --> 01:52:36,520
we're just going light right now
and then you go hard. You know,

1803
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,590
so you can't really surprise them in the,

1804
01:52:39,580 --> 01:52:44,230
like in public you gotta like you gotta
learn Jujitsu, go on the mat with them,

1805
01:52:44,231 --> 01:52:46,040
make them think you're not rolling.
Are they in surprise?

1806
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:46,521
And you know,

1807
01:52:46,521 --> 01:52:49,710
I think that's part of it is you become
more aware when you're just talking.

1808
01:52:50,410 --> 01:52:53,300
What you've been talking about the
past couple of minutes is awareness.

1809
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:56,480
And when you have Jujitsu
in your brain then,

1810
01:52:57,110 --> 01:52:59,660
and it's true with
boxing too, and Moy, Tai,

1811
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:02,240
when you have that stuff in your brain,

1812
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:07,130
then you can't help but be aware of what's
happening around you because it's in

1813
01:53:07,131 --> 01:53:11,480
there. It's like knowing that the
color of the table is Brown. Like you,

1814
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:14,480
you know what that
person's body position is.

1815
01:53:14,481 --> 01:53:16,820
You're looking and seeing that
their stance is off balance.

1816
01:53:16,821 --> 01:53:20,530
You're seeing an under hook exposed,
you know, so you can't help,

1817
01:53:20,540 --> 01:53:22,370
you can't take it away.
So your awareness increases.

1818
01:53:22,371 --> 01:53:26,120
You also are aware of what problems can
occur really quickly. So if you start,

1819
01:53:26,500 --> 01:53:29,540
you know, if you're a girl
and you say, oh wait a second,

1820
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:33,920
now I'm backed into a corner where I
can't get out, I don't like this feeling.

1821
01:53:34,160 --> 01:53:34,921
It becomes a,

1822
01:53:34,921 --> 01:53:38,510
it increases your awareness as a
human and makes you more aware of your

1823
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:42,860
surroundings. So there's so many
benefits. It's kind of ridiculous.

1824
01:53:43,460 --> 01:53:47,540
You kind of have almost like one level
up from that or awareness that you're

1825
01:53:47,541 --> 01:53:49,640
talking about because like how
are you saying it's part of that.

1826
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:52,750
Even if you don't know how to fight, it's
still kind of on your mind. You know,

1827
01:53:53,200 --> 01:53:55,680
like all guys have that
kind of of evaluates,

1828
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:59,270
especially with the guys close to
your close to you, who you are,

1829
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:02,540
what are the age, size,
whatever, whatever the scenario.

1830
01:54:02,541 --> 01:54:05,270
Even like if you're a scholar
and no one else's scholar,

1831
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:07,850
then another scholar walk through
this evaluation, you know?

1832
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:12,610
So that's how it is naturally
smart. This guy. Yeah. Well,

1833
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:15,680
so as a guy, just naturally
you're going to have even more,

1834
01:54:15,681 --> 01:54:17,930
it's like you know what the
color of brown is or whatever,

1835
01:54:17,931 --> 01:54:21,260
but just instinctually you're
always looking for Bratton.

1836
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:23,690
That's kind of what it's like.
So now you,

1837
01:54:23,930 --> 01:54:26,480
when you're doing these evaluations
that are going to happen anyway,

1838
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:31,700
your Jujitsu mind is right there
at the front. Ready the whole time.

1839
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:35,120
Yeah.
They thing to people.

1840
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:38,450
But that's not to be confused with like
you're aggressive and want to fight.

1841
01:54:38,451 --> 01:54:39,320
That's the weird thing.

1842
01:54:39,321 --> 01:54:43,010
It's like you don't want to actually
fight with people because you don't feel

1843
01:54:43,011 --> 01:54:44,940
the need to like, oh, I got, I dunno.

1844
01:54:46,180 --> 01:54:47,960
That's where this whole
conversation started off.

1845
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:50,630
And also now you not feel like
you need to prove anything.

1846
01:54:50,631 --> 01:54:53,390
But I literally am like, oh, there really
want to get in a fight with this guy.

1847
01:54:53,391 --> 01:54:54,660
I'm gonna get my knuckles.
You know,

1848
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:58,310
I'm not going to rip my tee
shirt disguising it. Right.
Yeah. This is really, no,

1849
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:03,110
I fight every single day.
I don't need,

1850
01:55:03,111 --> 01:55:05,240
I don't,
I don't care about this guy.

1851
01:55:05,340 --> 01:55:09,560
This is a two second thing where I've
got to scuff up my knee on the pavement

1852
01:55:09,740 --> 01:55:13,160
and he's probably gonna rip my shirt,
my shirt, and that's going to be a pain.

1853
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:15,830
And then I got to deal with the cops.
If they show up, it's just a big pain.

1854
01:55:16,250 --> 01:55:19,130
Whereas if you don't fight
and you have that opportunity,

1855
01:55:19,131 --> 01:55:20,590
maybe you got the thing
inside you and will,

1856
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:24,020
you don't know the payoff of the
fight, right? If you don't know or,

1857
01:55:24,021 --> 01:55:27,800
or if you're just insecurity over the
payoff of the fight and hopefully winning

1858
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,930
is bigger than all the detriments that
you had to be. I used to tell him,

1859
01:55:30,940 --> 01:55:35,540
my platoon guys, when we were overseas
before the war started, they didn't know.

1860
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:37,470
So guys were overseas. What
are you doing? You're drinking,

1861
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:40,580
you're out in bars or just causing
problems or whatever. And I've, you know,

1862
01:55:40,581 --> 01:55:43,070
before we go on over here, hey guys,
if you feel like fighting tonight,

1863
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:43,943
come find me.

1864
01:55:44,790 --> 01:55:47,520
Cause if you want to fight, come find me
and we'll, it'll be all be good. You know,

1865
01:55:47,800 --> 01:55:50,760
you, you know we'll, we'll fight and
it's all good. You won't get in trouble.

1866
01:55:50,761 --> 01:55:53,370
You won't get arrested. You
won't get hurt. It's all
good. You'll get in trouble.

1867
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:56,670
You get in trouble for sure. You're not
getting in trouble with the law though.

1868
01:55:56,671 --> 01:55:58,370
You know what I mean? You're not
going to get that kind of trouble.

1869
01:55:58,390 --> 01:56:01,320
You didn't have a little trouble in your
situation and your in your positioning

1870
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:04,530
is going to be troublesome.
So yeah,

1871
01:56:04,531 --> 01:56:07,380
it's better to fight amongst yourself
than to fight against the outsiders who

1872
01:56:07,381 --> 01:56:12,180
are going to sue you. Pull a knife out
and stab you in the throat, whatever.

1873
01:56:12,360 --> 01:56:17,290
Right. Don't do that. Stay out of the
street fights. Not Worth it, you know.

1874
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,770
All right.
I agree with it too though.

1875
01:56:20,060 --> 01:56:24,510
When you said you agree that it is
the stabilizer in religion. It is.

1876
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:27,120
Cause if you don't know, you don't
even know how much you don't know.

1877
01:56:28,170 --> 01:56:32,130
It's funny cause we get a lot of people
that have started training, Jujitsu move.

1878
01:56:32,180 --> 01:56:36,840
Yes. A have over. They'll come on
Twitter or on on the Facebook he and,

1879
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:41,700
and say, you know, um, hey, you
started training Jujitsu. Oh my God,

1880
01:56:42,300 --> 01:56:46,320
I can't believe I need to train this all
the time. I can't believe I got control.

1881
01:56:46,330 --> 01:56:50,250
How they always say how humiliating
and sometimes they say humbling,

1882
01:56:50,370 --> 01:56:52,050
but sometimes I think even
when they say humbling,

1883
01:56:52,110 --> 01:56:54,930
they actually mean humiliating
because they you've,

1884
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:59,430
that's the weird thing when you're
walking around on the earth without the

1885
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:02,820
knowledge, you don't, you look at
other people, you think, you know what?

1886
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:06,900
This guy knows Jujitsu. I heard this
guy knows just to, it doesn't matter.

1887
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:11,280
I'm strong, I'm athletic. I'll just
hit him in the neck. Or even even,

1888
01:57:11,281 --> 01:57:13,170
you know what? I'm just strong
enough. He's not going to get my,

1889
01:57:13,200 --> 01:57:16,590
how's he going to get my arm over there?
That's not gonna work.

1890
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:20,160
I'll just pull my arm back. And then you
get on the mat and you go, oh my Lord,

1891
01:57:20,161 --> 01:57:22,110
I have no control over this situation.

1892
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:26,850
This guy has effortlessly making me
submit over and over and over again.

1893
01:57:27,150 --> 01:57:29,910
And that's when the reality hits
the reality hits, doesn't it?

1894
01:57:29,911 --> 01:57:32,130
On the first time you tap cause
on the first time you tap you go,

1895
01:57:32,220 --> 01:57:36,390
oh I'm going to, I'll just, I won't
do that single movement again.

1896
01:57:36,510 --> 01:57:38,430
I won't stick my head over there.
Okay.

1897
01:57:38,520 --> 01:57:41,340
So then you get your arm locked and then
you get your foot locked and then you

1898
01:57:41,341 --> 01:57:43,560
get your knee lock and then you get
[inaudible] and then you get a gay teen

1899
01:57:43,561 --> 01:57:47,280
again. Then you get rid of.
So you all, it's just a lose,
lose, lose, lose, lose, lose,

1900
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:48,930
lose.
And then you go after.

1901
01:57:48,931 --> 01:57:52,370
Usually for me it's like three to five
times with somebody that's never changed

1902
01:57:52,371 --> 01:57:56,490
you. So before three to five times before
they realize like, oh I will never,

1903
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:57,720
cause you knew when you tap,

1904
01:57:57,721 --> 01:58:01,410
a guy wants us never trained before and
he comes at you so hard, he and his mind,

1905
01:58:01,411 --> 01:58:04,770
he thinks all this time I'm going to
get them and they don't even come close.

1906
01:58:04,771 --> 01:58:09,450
They don't even realize. So yeah, get on
the mat man and learn. Learn the Jujitsu.

1907
01:58:09,810 --> 01:58:10,643
Nope,

1908
01:58:11,430 --> 01:58:16,140
please cover the over or please cover
overcoming the frustrations of beginning

1909
01:58:16,290 --> 01:58:20,850
Jujitsu. And this is coming
from a 54 year old by the way,

1910
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:24,930
but not quitting. Good. Good
for him. That's awesome.

1911
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:29,490
Glad you're picking up the Jujitsu at
54 years old. Uh, okay. So how do you,

1912
01:58:29,491 --> 01:58:31,770
the frustrations of beginning
Jj and it is absolutely,

1913
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:33,270
if you have the wrong mindset,

1914
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:37,890
it's viciously frustrating because of
everything we just talked about and you

1915
01:58:37,891 --> 01:58:38,341
think,
oh,

1916
01:58:38,341 --> 01:58:40,920
I'll just do this and let's go a little
bit harder and I just won't put my arm

1917
01:58:40,921 --> 01:58:44,980
there. I'll be able to win. You're not
going to win. You are going to lose.

1918
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:48,970
You're going to lose over and over and
over again to people that are smaller

1919
01:58:48,971 --> 01:58:52,300
than you. Weaker than you.
Not as tough as you are.

1920
01:58:52,330 --> 01:58:56,020
Literally not as tough as you are.
Not as tough as you are. You know,

1921
01:58:56,021 --> 01:59:00,940
Jujitsu has a faction of,
of getting nerds,

1922
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,280
for lack of a better word,
straighten nerds.

1923
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:06,220
And no offense to the nerds out there,
but you know,

1924
01:59:06,221 --> 01:59:09,730
people that are not
physically active and in some,

1925
01:59:09,731 --> 01:59:13,750
for some reason they fall into Jujitsu
at some point and, and the, and they,

1926
01:59:13,751 --> 01:59:17,640
all of a sudden you've got a guy that's,
they're not tough, but they'll know,

1927
01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:20,050
they'll know the moves and
I'll finish you so that,

1928
01:59:20,051 --> 01:59:24,340
so those are the people you're going to
lose to. So, and it's a, it's a long,

1929
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:28,930
long,
slow journey that takes a long time.

1930
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,390
Now that being said,

1931
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:35,940
if you train for a month and
someone's trained zero is,

1932
01:59:35,941 --> 01:59:39,340
that journey's not that long. You've been
that guy, you, you will beat that guy.

1933
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:41,740
I mean, you know, again,
you take two people,

1934
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:45,590
one of them knows Jujitsu for a
month and one of them doesn't. Yup.

1935
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:49,990
That guy's going to win. I mean, you know,
basic weight, same weight, basic same,

1936
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:52,390
you know, you can't have
somebody that's completely weak,

1937
01:59:52,900 --> 01:59:55,750
but in six months you're beaten.
Anybody that's,

1938
01:59:55,751 --> 01:59:59,030
I'm trained for 95% of it.

1939
01:59:59,050 --> 02:00:03,790
Maybe you're 99% of people that aren't
trained, but, but, but as far as like,

1940
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:08,530
you think you show up and in six months
you're going to be beating a blue belt.

1941
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:11,590
It's not happening.
It's not happening.

1942
02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:14,890
A beating a purple belt is not happening.
You're not gonna,

1943
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:20,050
you're not gonna catch a purple belt know
in, in your first two or three years.

1944
02:00:20,500 --> 02:00:24,310
Um, unless you got to somebody
that doesn't, of course,

1945
02:00:24,870 --> 02:00:29,020
like Glover, Jeff Glover,
he'll, he'll, he'll, that
people put him in all kinds of,

1946
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:30,920
I mean, he does that in comedy. You
just saw that I've met at Morrison.

1947
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:34,990
He lefts all kinds of crazy things happen.
So yeah. Can that happen? Of course.

1948
02:00:35,170 --> 02:00:38,710
But as far as legitimately
taking someone down, yeah,

1949
02:00:38,740 --> 02:00:40,690
it's not going to happen
to you. So, so that's all.

1950
02:00:40,691 --> 02:00:44,470
That's what I'm saying is a long,
slow journey. Especially too,

1951
02:00:44,471 --> 02:00:47,410
because everyone's on that bus.
We've talked about this before.

1952
02:00:47,411 --> 02:00:50,320
Everyone's on the bus getting better.
So that blue belt that started,

1953
02:00:50,410 --> 02:00:53,080
that you started six months behind or
a year behind. So he's a blue belt.

1954
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:56,380
You're a year behind him.
He's not stopping getting better.

1955
02:00:56,380 --> 02:00:59,650
So as you start to pursue his game,

1956
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:01,990
his game is evolving and
changing and improving student,

1957
02:01:01,991 --> 02:01:06,190
you're not going to get there.
And then on top of that,

1958
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:11,060
when you do learn something new, it
takes time to incorporate into your game.

1959
02:01:11,061 --> 02:01:15,170
So if I taught you echo a new move
tonight as it, hey, here's a school,

1960
02:01:15,550 --> 02:01:17,440
here's this new setup for the arm lock,

1961
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:22,520
and we drilled it 10 times and you went
now and started to apply that, gee,

1962
02:01:22,630 --> 02:01:27,160
it would make your game worse because
you'd be trying to apply a move that you

1963
02:01:27,161 --> 02:01:31,330
don't know 100% yet. Like you got
some good solid moves that you do.

1964
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:34,300
And those are, you know,
those work really well.

1965
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:38,170
So when you start incorporating this new
move, you don't need to know it. Well,

1966
02:01:38,171 --> 02:01:42,500
you don't get it all together. So you're
going to fail out it a hundred times.

1967
02:01:42,590 --> 02:01:45,290
It's not going to work a hundred times
before you get it. And by the way,

1968
02:01:45,291 --> 02:01:47,900
every time you tried it on me, I got on
top and then I smashed you in the night.

1969
02:01:48,050 --> 02:01:50,900
So you're, you're sacrificing.
And it's in every time.

1970
02:01:50,901 --> 02:01:54,050
So you're actually going backwards a
little bit before you can go forward.

1971
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:57,080
So that's problematic and that's very,
very frustrating.

1972
02:01:57,530 --> 02:02:01,070
Occasionally you might learn something
that like really improves your game

1973
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:04,430
dramatically, almost instantly.
That happens from time to
time. Some will say, Hey,

1974
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:07,340
put your arm position here. Or Hey,
you know, whatever the case may be.

1975
02:02:07,970 --> 02:02:10,520
But generally when you incorporate
something new, it can take some time.

1976
02:02:11,930 --> 02:02:14,570
You're going to get injuries,
you're going to get little injuries,

1977
02:02:14,571 --> 02:02:17,510
you're going to get big injuries, you're
going to be sore, you're going to, so yes,

1978
02:02:17,511 --> 02:02:20,090
you will be frustrated.
So how do you counter all that?

1979
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:23,570
You just got to embrace it.
You got to embrace all those things.

1980
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:27,870
You got to enjoy all those things.
And I hate to be cliche,

1981
02:02:27,910 --> 02:02:29,570
but you got to enjoy the journey.

1982
02:02:29,571 --> 02:02:33,030
You got to enjoy getting tapped
out by somebody that smoking.

1983
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:38,270
Be Amazed by that. Say, Dang, how did
that just happen? That is impressive.

1984
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:42,470
Uh, you know, say hey, got a little
war scar on my face. I got, you know,

1985
02:02:42,471 --> 02:02:45,560
split the eye open. Okay, cool. Chicks
dig scars. You know what I mean?

1986
02:02:45,561 --> 02:02:47,930
Just going to go. Don't, don't,

1987
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:52,400
don't look at all that stuff as negative.
Look at it as, you know, it's like,

1988
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:57,080
don't rush to the end. Don't rush to the
end. Don't be in a rush to get there.

1989
02:02:57,230 --> 02:03:01,670
Take your time and enjoy the sites
that you're going to go for. Also,

1990
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:05,660
I've said this before,
select your training partners carefully,

1991
02:03:05,661 --> 02:03:07,160
especially like you're 54 years old.

1992
02:03:07,340 --> 02:03:11,480
You don't want to be rolling with a 20
year old steroid freak that's going white

1993
02:03:11,481 --> 02:03:12,380
belt trying to kill you.

1994
02:03:12,590 --> 02:03:17,590
You want to be rolling with a cool mellow
purple belt that's wants to do Jujitsu

1995
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:22,190
and train, um, and find
me. I would just say,

1996
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:28,130
remember that Jujitsu should be fun.
It should be all those other things,

1997
02:03:28,131 --> 02:03:30,140
all those frustrating, all those
challenges, all those things,

1998
02:03:30,141 --> 02:03:33,980
all that humiliation and humid and
getting humbled, but she'd be a good time.

1999
02:03:34,130 --> 02:03:37,610
You should have fun. We were doing
Jujitsu. I know I do. Yeah, yeah.

2000
02:03:37,611 --> 02:03:38,570
Like a video game,
right?

2001
02:03:38,571 --> 02:03:41,030
You know how I was going to hit
town for a couple of days, man,

2002
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:44,090
and I came back and had a little
injury that I figured figured out.

2003
02:03:44,230 --> 02:03:44,901
It took me a little while.

2004
02:03:44,901 --> 02:03:46,850
I got my jacked up finger and
it took me a little while,

2005
02:03:46,851 --> 02:03:49,100
a little while to get the right,

2006
02:03:49,490 --> 02:03:53,810
get the right apparatus to splint
it properly and protect it.

2007
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:57,200
But it's,
but tonight I train and I was so happy.

2008
02:03:58,120 --> 02:04:01,910
I was so happy. Go and getting
on the mat, just saying yes.

2009
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:05,250
Yeah,
that that is how we're all these,

2010
02:04:05,490 --> 02:04:09,480
all the junk parts that come with
it were quote unquote jumper.

2011
02:04:09,481 --> 02:04:12,900
You know like the bitterness.
Yeah. I got choked out. Aware.

2012
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:16,770
That's all part of the game.
Seems obvious, right? Yeah.
It's all part of the game.

2013
02:04:16,771 --> 02:04:19,480
But be happy that that's the
game you're in. You know? I mean,

2014
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:21,660
do you get some basic,
I mean if you don't do Jujitsu,

2015
02:04:22,170 --> 02:04:25,990
this would be kind of kind of an
insight. Basically all it is, you go,

2016
02:04:26,050 --> 02:04:29,670
if you go to a class, you go in,
you, you may or may not warm up.

2017
02:04:29,700 --> 02:04:33,480
You learn a move. Whether it be
a submission move or just a move.

2018
02:04:33,481 --> 02:04:37,740
You learn a move to move three moves,
sometimes four moves and then you to

2019
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,980
Roland straight up. You guys are
fighting, no strikes. That's it.

2020
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:44,070
You're finding no strikes. If
you whatever moves, you know,

2021
02:04:44,100 --> 02:04:47,910
go ahead and do them while in real
life against this guy. That's it.

2022
02:04:47,911 --> 02:04:51,660
If you don't know, if that's your
first day and you learn one, two,

2023
02:04:51,661 --> 02:04:55,200
three moves that first day, you better
try to do those moves. That's it.

2024
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:58,650
So of course, you know, two, three
moves that you learned once. By the way,

2025
02:04:59,010 --> 02:05:01,890
and your role with someone who, even
if he's still a white belt or whatever,

2026
02:05:02,070 --> 02:05:03,690
he knows those moves and then you know,
three,

2027
02:05:03,691 --> 02:05:06,810
four more and he's practiced some in,
you know, in real time or whatever.

2028
02:05:06,811 --> 02:05:09,390
Of course he's going to get you,
you know, that's just how it works.

2029
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:12,840
But keep in mind, the more
you go, the more you do, the
moves, more moves you learn,

2030
02:05:12,841 --> 02:05:14,370
the more you practice them in real life,

2031
02:05:14,371 --> 02:05:16,530
the better you get at them and you don't.

2032
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:19,740
Let's go ahead and just apply this to
life as well because you just to such a

2033
02:05:19,741 --> 02:05:23,850
great metaphor for life,
whatever you're doing,

2034
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:27,570
whatever goal you're trying to achieve,
if you're letting those frustrations,

2035
02:05:27,571 --> 02:05:30,900
we hit those obstacles. If you're letting
them control you and get you down,

2036
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:34,530
that's the wrong attitude to
have. You know, look at it
as a learning opportunity.

2037
02:05:34,531 --> 02:05:36,990
Look at it as something that's good,
that's happening. Look at it as,

2038
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:39,450
as a chance for you to try something new.

2039
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:43,470
Look at it as the journey that you're
trying to achieve. And by the way,

2040
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:46,830
anything that's easy to achieve
and you don't hit any obstacles,

2041
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:48,780
well that's not worth
it, right? That's not,

2042
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:52,020
is not going to get the full
satisfaction that you want out of that.

2043
02:05:52,290 --> 02:05:56,310
So in life as in Jujitsu,

2044
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:57,780
don't get frustrated.

2045
02:05:57,810 --> 02:06:02,810
Embrace those challenges because those
are what is making this goal worthwhile.

2046
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:08,460
You know, man, and I'm telling you when
you, let's say you well back to the, um,

2047
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:11,210
avoiding frustrations specifically.
Um,

2048
02:06:11,340 --> 02:06:13,140
it does how you were
saying training partners,

2049
02:06:13,170 --> 02:06:15,660
that doesn't make a big difference
because sometimes every once in a while,

2050
02:06:15,661 --> 02:06:17,800
like I've,
I've heard of people where they,

2051
02:06:17,801 --> 02:06:21,960
their schedule doesn't allow them to
catch like the beginner class for example.

2052
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:23,340
So they're like, hey, I have no choice.

2053
02:06:23,341 --> 02:06:25,560
I got to do this more
intermediate or advanced class.

2054
02:06:25,561 --> 02:06:29,160
So they're the only white belt
and the next, you know, guy,

2055
02:06:29,161 --> 02:06:31,290
even close to the Tim is
like advanced blue belt.

2056
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:35,410
So that's going to be
a steep learning curve.

2057
02:06:35,411 --> 02:06:38,520
It's going to be tough because how are
you going to practice your moves in the

2058
02:06:38,521 --> 02:06:41,160
wild. You won't get to work
your offense. It's really,

2059
02:06:41,210 --> 02:06:44,170
but he was kind of the good thing
you get to work your defense.

2060
02:06:44,170 --> 02:06:47,620
So when you do get the opportunity to
exercise, like your offense, whether you,

2061
02:06:47,621 --> 02:06:50,520
you get another class or it just comes
but just takes longer or whatever,

2062
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:53,370
but you know how good your defense
is going to be. Yeah. And I actually,

2063
02:06:53,490 --> 02:06:57,240
so from training with Dean
for so many years, you know,

2064
02:06:57,241 --> 02:07:01,950
he's just got some positions
that are brutal. Yeah. Brutal
positions. And you know,

2065
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:05,490
for instance, his mount is, is
outstanding. He's when he gets the mount,

2066
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:10,380
when anybody else that I've ever trained
with in my life as mountain with the

2067
02:07:10,381 --> 02:07:15,150
exception I guess of Hixon Gracie, I felt
like, oh well it's not dean. This is not,

2068
02:07:15,650 --> 02:07:18,930
you know, this isn't a horrible scenario.
Right. And not that I'm not that worried,

2069
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:22,290
I'm not trying to degrade people I've
trained with, but that is a great,

2070
02:07:22,350 --> 02:07:26,910
Dean has an incredible amount and on top
of that Dean kind of knows my escapes.

2071
02:07:27,120 --> 02:07:30,390
So whereas if I roll with a random
other really good, you know,

2072
02:07:30,740 --> 02:07:33,990
worldclass black belt, they might not
know the particulars of my escape.

2073
02:07:33,991 --> 02:07:37,420
Dean actually does those and
he's good and he's good at it.

2074
02:07:37,840 --> 02:07:41,770
So you're right in that the more you train
with people that are better than you,

2075
02:07:41,890 --> 02:07:46,570
you're, your defense is going to be
very good. Cause like when you mount me,

2076
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:50,410
I mean you've got a good solid
mountain, but I'm not, I'm
like, I'm like, okay cool.

2077
02:07:50,411 --> 02:07:52,980
I'm going to be out of this and
in a short period of time with,

2078
02:07:53,080 --> 02:07:57,850
with no real threats, keep telling
me and the re uh, you've had,

2079
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:00,280
I mean, I'm sure it's the same way
if you've got dean mountain on you.

2080
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:02,200
I mean my mouth,
because I don't have a great mouth.

2081
02:08:02,410 --> 02:08:07,300
My mouth is nothing compared to
deans. Nothing. Yeah, yeah. Fully.

2082
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:11,320
Yeah, that's absolutely true.
And at the same time though,

2083
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:13,750
so if you fall it,

2084
02:08:13,751 --> 02:08:16,690
and I don't want to say it's like a small
thing because it's pretty big chance

2085
02:08:16,691 --> 02:08:18,190
where if you enter a beginner class,

2086
02:08:18,191 --> 02:08:21,190
there's going to be a guy who's
just as much of a beginner is you.

2087
02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:24,430
And that's where you can
really flourish because you're,

2088
02:08:24,431 --> 02:08:29,380
you can practice moves your new moves,
which I mean, for lack of better term,

2089
02:08:29,381 --> 02:08:32,800
your junk moves, you know, junk
people. I will say this though,

2090
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:36,520
whoever you roll with,
whether they're worse than you,

2091
02:08:36,550 --> 02:08:38,890
the same as you or better than you,
you're going to get a lot out of it.

2092
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:39,850
Of course,
all three of them.

2093
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:42,070
So you should roll with all
three of those types of people.

2094
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:46,960
I have a tendency to want to usually
roll with guys that are, you know,

2095
02:08:47,180 --> 02:08:49,510
light good and,

2096
02:08:49,511 --> 02:08:52,840
and I should spend more than
I do. I mean, I definitely,

2097
02:08:52,841 --> 02:08:55,150
I trained with everybody that we got at
the gym. I'll turn him and everybody,

2098
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:59,350
but I always prefer, of course, I
guess I shouldn't say of course,

2099
02:08:59,351 --> 02:09:02,080
because there are people that
are like white belt hunters

2100
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:06,320
that want to go out there and be bullies.
I'm not like that.

2101
02:09:06,321 --> 02:09:09,640
I'd rather get bullied. Right. I
want to get, I want to feel the,

2102
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:12,490
I want to get after it, you know? Uh,

2103
02:09:12,730 --> 02:09:16,510
but you definitely get benefit from
training with people that are better than

2104
02:09:16,511 --> 02:09:20,530
you. Worse than you, and the same as
you because you practice one of them.

2105
02:09:20,740 --> 02:09:22,240
You're practicing defense,
one of them.

2106
02:09:22,241 --> 02:09:24,430
You're practicing pure offense
and someone that's equal than you.

2107
02:09:24,580 --> 02:09:26,320
You got to start
practicing your setups and,

2108
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:30,310
and your approaches and you got to
learn how to defend and do offense and

2109
02:09:30,311 --> 02:09:34,120
defense at the same time.
So it's all good, bro. Yeah.

2110
02:09:34,150 --> 02:09:38,560
That's basically the concept here.
Roll after it. Consider that scenario.

2111
02:09:38,561 --> 02:09:40,870
You roll with it and you're
talking from an ideal standpoint,

2112
02:09:40,871 --> 02:09:43,220
role with people better than you,
same as your worst in you or you know,

2113
02:09:43,330 --> 02:09:47,080
not as good as you. Um, for a
beginner, that's not really the option.

2114
02:09:47,110 --> 02:09:50,320
The worst than you guys. That's not
an option for a beginner. Like really,

2115
02:09:50,410 --> 02:09:52,410
and also there's no one
that's worse than them. Well,

2116
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:55,150
as far as overcoming the
frustrations or whatever,

2117
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:59,740
it is a good situation where you can
get in with guys just as beginner as you

2118
02:09:59,890 --> 02:10:00,140
and,

2119
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:04,110
and it helped that they hang around and
listen after a certain amount of time.

2120
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:07,160
Those guys who aren't as new or,
or I could,

2121
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:11,050
I could see where it could
become frustrating if you
were the guy that you're

2122
02:10:11,051 --> 02:10:12,460
talking about earlier.
Let's say a guy that's,

2123
02:10:12,520 --> 02:10:15,850
you have to work late and you can only
go to the advanced class and all of a

2124
02:10:15,851 --> 02:10:18,670
sudden you think Jujitsu is just
getting crushed and destroyed.

2125
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:23,410
They can't learn this really, I guess,
the distance to, to understand. But yeah,

2126
02:10:23,411 --> 02:10:26,530
that's, that's a good point. So keep in
mind that if you're in that situation,

2127
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:29,070
it's okay. You're gonna, you're going to,

2128
02:10:29,110 --> 02:10:32,770
when you eventually get to roll with
people that are more your skill level,

2129
02:10:33,200 --> 02:10:33,980
you will be,

2130
02:10:33,980 --> 02:10:38,570
uh, you'll be that much better
off. Yeah. Yeah, for sure.

2131
02:10:38,760 --> 02:10:41,960
And, and watch the first
time you tap someone out with
the move that you learned.

2132
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:48,620
Celebrate that. Did you, yeah,
that's a good, that's a good time.

2133
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:53,470
Next question,
Jocko.

2134
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:58,250
How do you balance the idea of checking
the ego well in an interview scenario

2135
02:10:58,280 --> 02:11:02,780
where you need to talk about yourself?
Okay. So good, good question.

2136
02:11:03,230 --> 02:11:06,140
I would say in that situation,

2137
02:11:06,141 --> 02:11:10,040
and that's something that it's not just
an interview situation where you're

2138
02:11:10,041 --> 02:11:14,660
going to need to do that. I mean, you're
dealing with your, your superiors,

2139
02:11:14,690 --> 02:11:18,080
you know, throughout the course of
your career, whatever that may be.

2140
02:11:18,081 --> 02:11:20,430
You're constantly interacting
with people and you of,

2141
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:23,400
you're going to want to
make an impression. Uh,

2142
02:11:23,401 --> 02:11:27,380
so I think one of the best
ways to do this is instead of,

2143
02:11:28,330 --> 02:11:28,820
okay,

2144
02:11:28,820 --> 02:11:31,970
you speaking about why you're so awesome,

2145
02:11:32,120 --> 02:11:37,120
just state facts of let's
say accomplishments and let
them speak for themselves.

2146
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:44,390
In other words, you know,
you wouldn't want to say, uh,

2147
02:11:45,970 --> 02:11:50,470
Yup, I am the best project manager
in the entire world. Right.

2148
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:51,333
That's not,

2149
02:11:51,580 --> 02:11:56,450
that's sounds ego centric.
You know,

2150
02:11:56,470 --> 02:12:01,210
instead you'd say, uh, you know, I got
this a, we had a $38 million project,

2151
02:12:01,211 --> 02:12:04,630
got it done on time, under
budget, ahead of schedule.

2152
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:05,890
And when I got done with that,

2153
02:12:05,891 --> 02:12:09,070
when they moved me to another project
that was off track and we got that one

2154
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:12,400
back on schedule and back
on track as well. So that,

2155
02:12:12,440 --> 02:12:14,560
that's the kind of experience
that I've had and I,

2156
02:12:14,561 --> 02:12:17,800
and above to bring that here to this
company. Right. So you're not, you're not,

2157
02:12:19,570 --> 02:12:23,200
you know, there's a hint of, hey, this
is what I did. I can get some stuff done,

2158
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:26,890
but you're not saying, listen, I'm better
than the people you currently have,

2159
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:30,400
so you should hire me because I'm the
best cause you don't want to do that. Um,

2160
02:12:31,330 --> 02:12:35,770
and you know, so, so yeah, just
build, think about it, you know,

2161
02:12:35,771 --> 02:12:37,510
before you go in, how, what,

2162
02:12:37,690 --> 02:12:42,010
what experience that you have represents
the good qualities that you have.

2163
02:12:42,370 --> 02:12:46,570
So then you can say, if they say, you
know, how are you at meeting timelines?

2164
02:12:46,750 --> 02:12:49,510
You don't say I am perfect
and we're never late dope.

2165
02:12:49,660 --> 02:12:53,890
You just say you say you say, well
you know, as far as meeting timelines,

2166
02:12:53,920 --> 02:12:56,950
here's a bunch of projects
that I got completed on time.

2167
02:12:57,100 --> 02:13:00,310
The only one that I missed was one that
we had to roll back cause whatever that

2168
02:13:00,311 --> 02:13:02,530
we are actually showing a little bit
more humility. You're saying, hey,

2169
02:13:02,531 --> 02:13:05,440
here's what happened. You're being
logical about it and you'll speak to that.

2170
02:13:05,590 --> 02:13:09,290
I actually got a good question
that's similar to this one. Um,

2171
02:13:09,580 --> 02:13:14,580
about what's the best way to interview
people to see if they can be in a

2172
02:13:15,791 --> 02:13:18,400
leadership position.
And this is really hard.

2173
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:21,970
This is really hard because it's
really hard to interviews and working.

2174
02:13:21,971 --> 02:13:24,850
I work with all kinds of
different companies and
everybody always has, you know,

2175
02:13:24,851 --> 02:13:26,890
hey, what's the best way
to interview? And Man,

2176
02:13:26,891 --> 02:13:28,720
I interviewed this guy
and he seems so great.

2177
02:13:28,721 --> 02:13:31,170
Or I interviewed this woman and
she seemed incredible and her,

2178
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:32,880
her paper look great.
You know,

2179
02:13:33,060 --> 02:13:35,780
she looked great on paper and we
hired her and she's a disaster.

2180
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:38,400
He's a disaster or whatever
the case may be. Because,

2181
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:41,340
because there's people that are
very good interviewers, right?

2182
02:13:41,341 --> 02:13:44,580
I mean there's people that can interview
well they have the gift of Gab,

2183
02:13:44,610 --> 02:13:47,880
they can, they can bs their way through
anything and make themselves sound good.

2184
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:53,060
So it can be really hard to identify if
someone's good is actually going to be

2185
02:13:54,661 --> 02:13:56,730
fit for a leadership position
or really any position.

2186
02:13:56,940 --> 02:13:59,880
So one of the things that I
was telling people to do is it,

2187
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:02,250
when you go into these,
when you want to ask interview questions,

2188
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:06,600
ask them scenario based questions and
say, okay, here's what's going on.

2189
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:11,720
You've got these three people in your
department and one of the people has come

2190
02:14:13,951 --> 02:14:17,550
to you and said that they think there
might be something illegal going on in

2191
02:14:17,580 --> 02:14:21,090
with the other two. What actions
do you take? And you know,

2192
02:14:21,091 --> 02:14:24,930
have a scenario built out that you can
actually talk through and see where they

2193
02:14:24,931 --> 02:14:28,110
go and see what their mindset is and see
what they're going to develop as a plan.

2194
02:14:28,111 --> 02:14:29,200
And see how they would execute the plan.

2195
02:14:29,201 --> 02:14:33,210
So it's a great way of
figuring out how people think.

2196
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:38,310
And then you know, even that's not a
guarantee because there's people that can,

2197
02:14:38,520 --> 02:14:42,090
can navigate those types of
answers as well. So, you know,

2198
02:14:42,091 --> 02:14:44,970
one thing you can do is hire people
on a little bit of a trial basis.

2199
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,490
And that can be difficult
in some situations where
people are walking away from

2200
02:14:47,491 --> 02:14:50,460
one job to another job or they're not
going to do it on a 90 day trial basis.

2201
02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:54,990
But when you do have that opportunity,
it's a good thing to do as well. Um,

2202
02:14:55,230 --> 02:14:55,651
but hey,

2203
02:14:55,651 --> 02:15:00,060
so going back to the first question
about keeping your ego in check and an

2204
02:15:00,061 --> 02:15:01,620
interview,
like I said,

2205
02:15:02,610 --> 02:15:07,610
be confident but not cocky and let the
facts of your experience speak for your,

2206
02:15:09,210 --> 02:15:13,170
your abilities rather than
beating your own chest.

2207
02:15:13,690 --> 02:15:16,330
Yeah. So it's almost like, I mean,
correct me if I'm wrong here,

2208
02:15:16,490 --> 02:15:21,190
still you, you essentially, even
if you're talking yourself up,

2209
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:25,360
you just, you simply state the
fact that you just state the fact,

2210
02:15:25,361 --> 02:15:26,650
don't say your opinion about it.

2211
02:15:27,630 --> 02:15:31,170
Just simply state the facts.
Here's what I did, you know,

2212
02:15:31,600 --> 02:15:34,750
we turned this project around, we
got it on, on track and on budget.

2213
02:15:34,751 --> 02:15:35,710
And that's the type of,

2214
02:15:35,950 --> 02:15:38,490
that's the type of experience that
I have in those situations. Right.

2215
02:15:38,860 --> 02:15:43,840
Just like how you're saying like even if
someone has got like an award to be the

2216
02:15:43,841 --> 02:15:46,390
best,
whatever salesman of the year,

2217
02:15:46,420 --> 02:15:50,110
the right tells me that you're the best
whatever of the year. And then, um,

2218
02:15:50,440 --> 02:15:52,900
like to say that in a
factual way would be,

2219
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:57,250
I was recognized as the best guy in the
world instead of saying I'm the best guy

2220
02:15:57,251 --> 02:15:59,740
in the world who my award to to prove it,
you know?

2221
02:15:59,741 --> 02:16:02,530
So it's like you're seeing the fact
that you were recognized, you know,

2222
02:16:02,920 --> 02:16:07,780
not so much the fact that a way of
doing it stick to the facts. Right.

2223
02:16:07,781 --> 02:16:12,550
Just the facts. Just the facts. It's
good. Yeah. Sure. Next question.

2224
02:16:12,610 --> 02:16:13,443
Um,

2225
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:18,820
how do you stay humble when you know
you have better skillsets than others?

2226
02:16:18,910 --> 02:16:22,840
You seem humble with all that
you've accomplished. Well,

2227
02:16:23,220 --> 02:16:25,970
this is just what like in general,
just holiday back, be humble.

2228
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:30,100
How'd you stay humble when you know
you have better skill sets than, and

2229
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,730
then he's saying that I seem humble with
all that I've accomplished, which is,

2230
02:16:33,970 --> 02:16:38,620
which is actually,
it's funny when I read that,

2231
02:16:38,621 --> 02:16:39,880
like it's not,

2232
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:43,900
I'm sure that for the dude
is asking this question,

2233
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:46,990
he's thinking I accomplished all this
stuff and it's not, I don't feel that way.

2234
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:51,670
Like first of all, there's always
somebody that's better than you.

2235
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,540
That's D. I guarantee it. There's
someone that's done more than you.

2236
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:56,930
There's someone that's
had better experiences,

2237
02:16:56,940 --> 02:16:59,200
someone that's accomplished more and,

2238
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:04,260
and if you are truly the
master of some thing,

2239
02:17:06,320 --> 02:17:09,730
whatever one thing
you're a true master of,

2240
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:14,380
there's going to be people that are a
lot better at other things than you.

2241
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:18,100
So you might be the master
of one particular thing,

2242
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:20,170
but are you,

2243
02:17:20,171 --> 02:17:25,171
you have to respect the fact that people
are going to be masters at other things

2244
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:29,560
or better than you'd think. I mean, so
if you're super strong, that's great.

2245
02:17:29,561 --> 02:17:33,310
Let's see. You run a marathon. If
you're super flexible, awesome.

2246
02:17:33,790 --> 02:17:37,240
How much can you dead lift if you're,
if you're smart, that's great.

2247
02:17:37,241 --> 02:17:38,470
You're smart academically,

2248
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:43,500
let's check out your common sense and see
where all that at. You know, so, so you,

2249
02:17:43,620 --> 02:17:45,730
you,
you are going to be good at one thing,

2250
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:49,570
but you're going to have failed in other
areas or have weaknesses in other areas.

2251
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:54,380
And so
you just have to keep that in check.

2252
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:56,330
And I'll tell you like,

2253
02:17:56,390 --> 02:18:01,390
I recognize why I've been successful,

2254
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:05,680
you know, for one thing, been
surrounded with great people,

2255
02:18:05,890 --> 02:18:09,460
for others being lucky in
certain situations that
I've been in certain times.

2256
02:18:09,820 --> 02:18:12,580
And you know,
going back to Jujitsu a little bit,

2257
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:18,810
it's a good example because just
because I can beat someone in Jujitsu,

2258
02:18:21,750 --> 02:18:25,240
it doesn't mean that I'm a
better person. Yeah, it does.

2259
02:18:26,350 --> 02:18:27,910
It doesn't mean that I'm a better person.

2260
02:18:28,570 --> 02:18:33,570
It what it means basically
is that I happen to get into
this random fringe sport

2261
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:39,580
before they did and I spent more
time on the math and they did.

2262
02:18:39,581 --> 02:18:41,590
That's what it means.
It doesn't make me a better person.

2263
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:44,530
And I'll tell you what it goes
with. You know, if you're,

2264
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:47,170
if you feel like you're
smarter than someone,

2265
02:18:47,230 --> 02:18:52,210
it's probably because you've had the
opportunity to study a subject or you've

2266
02:18:52,211 --> 02:18:55,230
had a bunch of education on something or
you've, you've dove into some subjects.

2267
02:18:55,231 --> 02:18:57,190
So that might make you seem smarter.

2268
02:18:57,191 --> 02:19:00,070
Whereas if they applied themselves and
that particular because what they were

2269
02:19:00,071 --> 02:19:04,930
applying themselves to
something else. So yeah, stay,

2270
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,520
you gotta stay humble with that.

2271
02:19:07,150 --> 02:19:11,860
And also when we talked about
those are when you fo [inaudible],

2272
02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:15,780
I am smarter than this person.
Well guess what? There's something,

2273
02:19:15,781 --> 02:19:18,370
there's still something that they're
better than you and what is it?

2274
02:19:18,550 --> 02:19:20,020
You might be smarter than him,
but guess what?

2275
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:23,800
Maybe the guy we talked about earlier
where I'm smart as I can be, guess what?

2276
02:19:23,801 --> 02:19:27,100
This person can physically take me down
and dominate me and that's horrible.

2277
02:19:27,230 --> 02:19:29,360
Or they're better at whatever,
better athletically.

2278
02:19:29,361 --> 02:19:32,330
Or some people are really good
craftsman with their hands. I mean,

2279
02:19:32,331 --> 02:19:34,820
there's so many different
things you can be skilled at.

2280
02:19:35,570 --> 02:19:39,920
And if you start thinking that yourself,
that you're,

2281
02:19:41,060 --> 02:19:42,560
that you're better than other people,

2282
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:48,260
you're going to have issues because in
the long run you want to stay humble.

2283
02:19:48,770 --> 02:19:52,330
Just stay alive because
life will humbly humble you.

2284
02:19:52,430 --> 02:19:54,050
Life is hard.

2285
02:19:54,051 --> 02:19:58,460
And if you're pushing hard and you're
driving hard and you're trying to achieve

2286
02:19:58,461 --> 02:20:01,490
a lot, you're not always going
to win. I don't care who you are.

2287
02:20:01,490 --> 02:20:04,370
You going to get humbled. It's
going to be hard. So many,

2288
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:06,140
so many people that are successful,

2289
02:20:06,141 --> 02:20:10,580
they've got some hard luck stories along
the way of things that they had to push

2290
02:20:10,581 --> 02:20:13,020
through and overcome in order
to get there. They got humbled.

2291
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:18,020
And if you're winning every single time,

2292
02:20:18,260 --> 02:20:22,400
then you're, you're not, your
goals aren't high enough.

2293
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:25,910
So step those up. So, you
know, I appreciate the,

2294
02:20:26,210 --> 02:20:30,050
the kind of comment, but um, man,

2295
02:20:30,051 --> 02:20:32,490
it's not hard to be humble when you know,
you can,

2296
02:20:32,491 --> 02:20:36,020
you just take like maybe someone I
didn't, you know, people always think, oh,

2297
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:41,810
oh, he's a navy seal or
whatever. Um, you know,

2298
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:46,840
there's a lot of seals that are more
badass than me that done more deployments

2299
02:20:47,331 --> 02:20:51,740
that have gotten after it
more than me. And I know that,
that, that, that's awesome.

2300
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,970
I mean, good, good for them. I, you know,

2301
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:00,680
they got after it good. Um,
so I don't feel like, oh,

2302
02:21:00,681 --> 02:21:04,160
I did more than everybody.
No, there's no one like that.

2303
02:21:04,740 --> 02:21:06,950
There was no one like that.
Even even, uh, you know,

2304
02:21:06,951 --> 02:21:11,050
Mikey Thorton who will seal that won
a medal of honor, awesome guy of, uh,

2305
02:21:11,180 --> 02:21:15,940
you know, just to, just to, you know,
he's a, he's a hero, but if, you know,

2306
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:18,470
when he gets interviewed,
I've watched a bunch of interviewed here,

2307
02:21:18,500 --> 02:21:21,910
heard him talk, he's like, you know,
he's like, oh, you know, you, you,

2308
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:24,980
you got the medal of honors x,
not mine. It's my guys. You know,

2309
02:21:24,981 --> 02:21:29,540
it's the guys I was with. It
represents all. So there's a guy like,

2310
02:21:29,541 --> 02:21:32,440
who's going to be,
if there's anyone in the world needs to,

2311
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:35,420
that could not be humble.
Maybe it's Mikey Thorton,

2312
02:21:35,960 --> 02:21:40,040
but guess what Mikey Thornton,
he's as humble as they
come, because you know what?

2313
02:21:40,040 --> 02:21:44,300
He also has been humbled by combat
cause he realized there's things that he

2314
02:21:44,301 --> 02:21:47,390
tried to do that he didn't get done.
There's blinds,

2315
02:21:47,391 --> 02:21:49,970
he tried to save that he couldn't save.
So you're Gunna,

2316
02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:53,420
there's no doubt if you're
living the right life,

2317
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:57,320
you're going to be humbled by
it. And there's always, always,

2318
02:21:57,350 --> 02:22:00,180
always going to be somebody that's better
than you that's done. But then you,

2319
02:22:00,181 --> 02:22:04,340
so just stay humble. And by the way,
what does being cocky gets you anyways?

2320
02:22:04,490 --> 02:22:08,240
What does that turn you into? What
I talked about last time, what is,

2321
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:11,900
what is overconfidence gets you, you
start cutting corners, you start to slack.

2322
02:22:11,901 --> 02:22:16,010
I mean it's just ridiculous. So you got
to stay humble. You've got to stay hungry.

2323
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:19,070
If you, if you want to stay
in the game and believe me,

2324
02:22:19,700 --> 02:22:22,250
you want to stay in the game on
if you want to stay in the game.

2325
02:22:22,960 --> 02:22:24,230
Did he think that

2326
02:22:26,030 --> 02:22:28,380
like, and I can't, I mean,

2327
02:22:28,381 --> 02:22:32,280
I don't know if maybe this is where
this even the question is coming from,

2328
02:22:33,210 --> 02:22:35,200
but if,
you know,

2329
02:22:35,201 --> 02:22:39,090
when you're insecure and at
you like you're just like
everything's a competition.

2330
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:43,140
Like, just in life, it's, it's like,
it goes beyond just what you're into.

2331
02:22:43,170 --> 02:22:47,010
It's just like, if someone's better
than me feel, it makes me mad.

2332
02:22:47,011 --> 02:22:50,070
It makes you uneasy or whatever.
It's like this insecurity kind of thing.

2333
02:22:50,280 --> 02:22:51,120
So when you do,

2334
02:22:51,121 --> 02:22:54,060
it's like if you look at everything
is just this big life compare.

2335
02:22:54,090 --> 02:22:56,310
Like I got to beat that guy
gotta be better than them.

2336
02:22:56,311 --> 02:22:57,900
So when you are better than them,

2337
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:01,260
it's like you're still looking at it as
this competition. Like, Eh, you know,

2338
02:23:01,261 --> 02:23:04,860
like you're not on my level,
so you don't deserve to be treated.

2339
02:23:04,950 --> 02:23:08,310
It's kind of like maybe this good analogy,
maybe not,

2340
02:23:08,311 --> 02:23:11,730
but like in Jujitsu where if you roll
with a white belt, you don't go hard,

2341
02:23:11,970 --> 02:23:16,650
you don't get satisfaction or whatever.
So in the Jujitsu competition arena,

2342
02:23:16,651 --> 02:23:21,210
you're not giving them the respect.
You're not going all out like you would,

2343
02:23:21,470 --> 02:23:24,510
you know, you're not respecting
his arm bar. You know, if you are,

2344
02:23:24,511 --> 02:23:26,670
you're smashing him. No
satisfaction, you know, whatever.

2345
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:29,400
It's in that specific competition setting.

2346
02:23:29,580 --> 02:23:33,510
But if you're just an insecure person
where you think that all life is like just

2347
02:23:33,511 --> 02:23:35,700
one big competition,
you've got to smash that person.

2348
02:23:36,090 --> 02:23:37,920
And if you're not worthy of my smashing,

2349
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:41,250
it's like I don't even treat you like you
should be on the mats with the kind of

2350
02:23:41,251 --> 02:23:43,080
saying cool, but may, I mean,

2351
02:23:43,081 --> 02:23:46,080
do you think that maybe that's
where some of that comes from?

2352
02:23:46,200 --> 02:23:50,190
Like if you're having trouble,
like being humble,

2353
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:52,290
it's kind of like I'm
better than you in life

2354
02:23:53,570 --> 02:23:56,970
driven from intercity insecurity,
but there's also a way, uh,

2355
02:23:57,440 --> 02:24:01,670
there's a dichotomy there too
because man, I like to win. Like,

2356
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:05,930
like no doubt about it.
I like to win in the dichotomy of it is,

2357
02:24:05,931 --> 02:24:10,880
is that I also don't literally don't care.
Like if I get beat,

2358
02:24:10,881 --> 02:24:14,660
I'm like, okay, well what can
I do to get better? It's not,

2359
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:20,380
I don't feel this despair because I lost.

2360
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:24,140
Losing actually kind of motivates me more.
Yeah.

2361
02:24:24,500 --> 02:24:27,170
As opposed to getting angry.

2362
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:29,930
And the worst thing that happens is people
decide they're not going to compete.

2363
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:30,231
Right.

2364
02:24:30,231 --> 02:24:33,860
They're not going to compete in the game
of life because they didn't win or they

2365
02:24:33,861 --> 02:24:36,860
don't feel like they can win. So they
go, ah, you know what? I'm just gonna,

2366
02:24:37,700 --> 02:24:40,430
I'm just going to back off. I'm just
not going to participate in the game.

2367
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:45,020
But getting the game
get in the game theme.

2368
02:24:45,610 --> 02:24:47,440
So maybe it comes from

2369
02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:54,070
not understanding what that
means when you win and stuff.

2370
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:57,180
I guess.

2371
02:24:57,180 --> 02:25:01,330
I guess like let's say like the fight
back to the fighting situation where the

2372
02:25:01,331 --> 02:25:05,110
about, you know, being a secure part
of the males, balancing real psyche.

2373
02:25:05,410 --> 02:25:10,240
If you know that you've achieved these
skills, have these skills to when people,

2374
02:25:10,241 --> 02:25:13,360
you know who, who don't have your
skillset, you don't want to fight them.

2375
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:17,200
So you're just like, whatever.
But let's say like you,

2376
02:25:17,201 --> 02:25:19,840
you have a better skillset yet you're
still blowing your horn about your

2377
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:24,100
skillset. You know, you're not
humble about it. It's, it's

2378
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:25,690
like he comes from maybe,
I don't know, something.

2379
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:29,110
There's no doubt there can be
some insecurity that charges,

2380
02:25:29,140 --> 02:25:34,140
that makes people super
competitive beyond healthy,

2381
02:25:36,311 --> 02:25:40,510
competitive, just like in life, like
just in life, you know? No matter what,

2382
02:25:41,080 --> 02:25:45,790
which again, there's people that
are that way, myself included. And,

2383
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:51,610
but again, the dichotomy is I don't think
you're like, no, no, I, I, I know I am.

2384
02:25:51,850 --> 02:25:56,210
Well, how can I in the know I am remember
echelon front, remember the logo? Yeah.

2385
02:25:56,260 --> 02:25:57,093
Right.

2386
02:25:57,100 --> 02:26:01,840
And I'm going to post this on Twitter
to Jocko made the original echelon front

2387
02:26:01,841 --> 02:26:06,550
logo Liz like long time ago. And you're
like, hey, you know, this is the logo,

2388
02:26:06,551 --> 02:26:09,890
something like this.
And then basically you,

2389
02:26:10,060 --> 02:26:12,670
but you didn't care that
it was junk. No, no. But I,

2390
02:26:12,671 --> 02:26:15,880
all I want to do is get you the idea.
You weren't competing with me,

2391
02:26:16,090 --> 02:26:17,860
but you drew and I drew.
But like,

2392
02:26:17,930 --> 02:26:19,870
like as someone who's competing
in everything in life,

2393
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:21,880
like if you draw something and I
draw something and you're like,

2394
02:26:22,120 --> 02:26:25,070
I want to make mine better.
No, no, no, no. But well, uh,

2395
02:26:25,090 --> 02:26:29,530
see I wanted to win with the idea, not
with the skill, the idea of the war.

2396
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:31,480
I wanted to win the war,
not the short term battle.

2397
02:26:31,481 --> 02:26:33,310
It's like who can draw this thing better?

2398
02:26:33,970 --> 02:26:37,750
That the war was who comes
up with a strategic victory,

2399
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:43,320
which the icon and the symbol for
echelon front is the one that I drew.

2400
02:26:45,520 --> 02:26:49,330
I liked it.
So yes,

2401
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:52,000
I didn't care that it looked
like junk cause I'm not,

2402
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:54,460
I was did it what you should
post docs is pretty fun.

2403
02:26:54,461 --> 02:26:58,780
I did it on PowerPoint with like a, like
a Cran, it looks like a crayon cause I,

2404
02:26:58,980 --> 02:27:00,880
I didn't want to take as
much time with it. I know,

2405
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:05,950
I knew that that thing would take you
15 minutes to make on your, what is it?

2406
02:27:05,951 --> 02:27:07,480
Ai Ill illustrator

2407
02:27:09,280 --> 02:27:12,460
that might have been
with don't be mad at me.

2408
02:27:12,461 --> 02:27:17,440
That's probably the first logo I've
ever actually made. Hmm. Maybe hey,

2409
02:27:17,441 --> 02:27:22,270
there you go. Cool.
Thanks for trusting me.

2410
02:27:24,910 --> 02:27:25,743
Next question.

2411
02:27:28,450 --> 02:27:33,450
What do you do when you have two extreme
ownership believers that have to go

2412
02:27:34,181 --> 02:27:36,250
against each other?
Ooh,

2413
02:27:37,450 --> 02:27:39,310
sounds like a big challenging question,

2414
02:27:40,030 --> 02:27:43,240
but it actually shouldn't be
because if you think about this,

2415
02:27:43,270 --> 02:27:46,660
if you truly think about this, this
should not be an issue and here's why.

2416
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:51,610
Go against each other,
against each other.

2417
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:55,420
So what are the goals are,
are these two people on the same team?

2418
02:27:55,421 --> 02:27:58,480
I'm assuming that they're on the same
team right there on the same team.

2419
02:27:58,600 --> 02:28:01,420
So if they're on the same
team and we want to win,

2420
02:28:02,740 --> 02:28:04,660
we have the same goals.
We want to win,

2421
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:10,020
but we won't work together because if
the goal is to win and we both want to

2422
02:28:10,781 --> 02:28:15,280
win,
why would we be going against each other?

2423
02:28:15,580 --> 02:28:16,840
We are not taping,

2424
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:21,290
taking actual extreme ownership because
if you and I were had opposing ideas,

2425
02:28:21,291 --> 02:28:24,080
but we had those same longterm goal,
I'm going to take ownership and say,

2426
02:28:24,081 --> 02:28:26,360
all right, echo, we got to come to terms
here. We're going to work this out.

2427
02:28:26,361 --> 02:28:29,030
We got to fix it. If you were
doing the same thing, you'd
be like, yeah, absolutely.

2428
02:28:29,031 --> 02:28:30,170
Let's sit down.
Let's figure this out.

2429
02:28:30,171 --> 02:28:31,740
Let's figure out what's going to
be the best. Let's take two mark.

2430
02:28:31,741 --> 02:28:34,970
Let's do a market says we're going to
figure out a real solution because we're

2431
02:28:34,971 --> 02:28:35,960
taking ownership of it.

2432
02:28:36,230 --> 02:28:40,280
So what's the little nugget that's
getting into the system here in screwing

2433
02:28:40,281 --> 02:28:41,150
things up?
It's Edd.

2434
02:28:41,170 --> 02:28:46,170
Go 100% and I will say this occasionally,

2435
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:51,850
the idea of extreme ownership can
be very poorly and very incorrectly

2436
02:28:53,301 --> 02:28:56,990
interpreted as micromanagement
and Egomania meaning like,

2437
02:28:57,070 --> 02:29:01,310
I'm going to own this, I own
this. This is mine, right?

2438
02:29:01,610 --> 02:29:05,150
We're not, that's not what
extreme ownership is at all.

2439
02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:09,380
It's you. You've got to own
everything, but you don't,

2440
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:14,890
you don't feel the intrinsic
need to do everything right

2441
02:29:17,630 --> 02:29:18,770
cause you own.

2442
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:23,830
It's like owning the outcome and the
owning the progress and owning the steps

2443
02:29:26,691 --> 02:29:30,680
along the way and owning the
responsibility of mission achievement.

2444
02:29:30,681 --> 02:29:35,681
It doesn't mean that you
own each individual step
and you have to make it your

2445
02:29:36,351 --> 02:29:39,350
way. That's not extreme
ownership. That's micromanagement.

2446
02:29:40,900 --> 02:29:43,220
What you know,
it's so extreme ownership is about

2447
02:29:44,990 --> 02:29:48,590
leadership and decentralized command.

2448
02:29:48,960 --> 02:29:53,600
Then using indirect tactics to make
things happen in owning the outcome.

2449
02:29:54,410 --> 02:29:56,570
So that's,
that's why when you,

2450
02:29:56,571 --> 02:30:00,770
if you have two people that
were truly about like, Hey,

2451
02:30:00,771 --> 02:30:02,750
I'm gonna own this,
I'm going to do,

2452
02:30:02,751 --> 02:30:04,490
I'm going to have the
attitude of extreme ownership.

2453
02:30:04,491 --> 02:30:06,680
If you and I have the
attitude of extreme ownership,

2454
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:11,420
we're not going to fight over anything
because we have the same long term goal

2455
02:30:11,810 --> 02:30:15,470
and if you come up with a better idea
of how to get there, I'm going to say,

2456
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:19,730
oh, Echo, awesome job. That's a great way.

2457
02:30:19,910 --> 02:30:23,060
We're going to get to where we want to go.
We own that outcome.

2458
02:30:23,061 --> 02:30:25,790
We're going to make it happen.
Boom, I'm going to support you.

2459
02:30:26,090 --> 02:30:30,410
The only time it's going to be a problem
is if I have an ego and then you have

2460
02:30:30,411 --> 02:30:31,244
an ego.

2461
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:36,600
When we both have an ego issue and
and usually one person with a big ego,

2462
02:30:38,600 --> 02:30:43,600
it that that inflames other
people's he egos because if I say,

2463
02:30:44,540 --> 02:30:48,170
hey, echo, I got a great plan for how to
do this. We need to execute it my way.

2464
02:30:48,710 --> 02:30:50,240
There's a little bit of ego coming out.

2465
02:30:50,270 --> 02:30:53,670
It doesn't matter because now your ego
was down, but I wasn't even really,

2466
02:30:53,690 --> 02:30:56,600
what do you mean you're away? Right?
Well, wait a second, just right there.

2467
02:30:56,601 --> 02:30:59,320
Now we've got a thing. Now we've got some
cop kind of issue going on. You know,

2468
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:03,650
we're now, we're working against each
other instead of working together.

2469
02:31:03,740 --> 02:31:08,630
So that is, uh, that is
absolutely problematic.

2470
02:31:08,631 --> 02:31:11,600
And I guess to say,
to put this in a nutshell,

2471
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:16,340
the Wifi, if you're using the
principle of extreme ownership,

2472
02:31:17,150 --> 02:31:22,150
the most important thing you to take
extreme ownership of is your own ego and

2473
02:31:23,251 --> 02:31:26,880
put that thing in check.
Yeah.

2474
02:31:26,881 --> 02:31:31,860
It seems like the extreme ownership
as far as owning it is more,

2475
02:31:31,930 --> 02:31:35,370
is essentially take responsibility,
like at all costs kind of thing.

2476
02:31:35,371 --> 02:31:39,660
For more like the, the bad stuff
that happened, the bad stuff.

2477
02:31:39,810 --> 02:31:40,940
Absolutely the best.
What'd you know?

2478
02:31:41,100 --> 02:31:43,620
But you're going to take
week because absolutely.

2479
02:31:43,890 --> 02:31:48,780
If you and I do something great together
and I was the leader, I don't go,

2480
02:31:48,781 --> 02:31:53,520
yes, that's right. I was the, I'm the,
you know, you say, Hey, first of all,

2481
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:56,490
this was mostly on Echo. He did most
of the work. He did all the, you know,

2482
02:31:56,491 --> 02:31:58,620
that's what I'm going to say. I'm
not going to say no, this was mine.

2483
02:31:59,100 --> 02:32:02,040
But when something goes wrong,
obviously I don't say no.

2484
02:32:02,041 --> 02:32:05,510
It was echo's fault number. I say,
Hey, this was my fault. So, you know,

2485
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:08,760
I should have done double check on the
audio before we started the podcast

2486
02:32:08,761 --> 02:32:12,870
because, uh, you know, we wanted to make
sure that thing was recording, right?

2487
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:17,670
I don't say no. Echo dropped the ball.
Yeah, I don't do that on him. I said, hey,

2488
02:32:17,671 --> 02:32:18,540
you should have double checked.

2489
02:32:18,840 --> 02:32:23,840
So that's if you truly have to people
that have real ownership and they put

2490
02:32:24,841 --> 02:32:28,920
their egos in check, this is literally
not an issue. Right? So they, yeah,

2491
02:32:28,921 --> 02:32:30,510
this isn't even a question for that,
right?

2492
02:32:30,511 --> 02:32:33,150
Cause they don't go against each other.
They're going with each other.

2493
02:32:33,151 --> 02:32:38,151
And so what are the chances that you as
a person that's really put your ego in

2494
02:32:38,611 --> 02:32:40,410
check and you're exercising
extreme ownership,

2495
02:32:40,710 --> 02:32:45,710
what are the chances that you work with
another person that is exactly with the

2496
02:32:48,211 --> 02:32:51,280
same mindset taking ownership but no ego.
What,

2497
02:32:51,320 --> 02:32:53,670
what are the chances that
they're actually pretty slim?

2498
02:32:53,730 --> 02:32:56,640
This is not easy to do this.
It's simple. Not Easy, right?

2499
02:32:56,910 --> 02:33:01,910
So that means you have to be even more
proactive in helping adapt to their ego

2500
02:33:05,761 --> 02:33:09,330
scenario that's happening. And when Echo
says, hey, we need to do this my way,

2501
02:33:09,390 --> 02:33:12,180
I'll be like, hey, you know what? Echo,
let's take a look at it. Absolutely.

2502
02:33:12,181 --> 02:33:13,500
You've always come up with great plans.

2503
02:33:13,501 --> 02:33:15,330
Let's take a look at
what this one is here.

2504
02:33:15,660 --> 02:33:19,260
And all of a sudden I've disarmed you a
little bit. You're feeling good about it.

2505
02:33:19,261 --> 02:33:22,230
You're like, oh yeah, that's right. Jack
was going to listen to me cause that's,

2506
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:24,120
that's great.
That's exactly what I want you to think.

2507
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:28,470
It's exactly what I want you to think.
So you're going to have work to do.

2508
02:33:28,530 --> 02:33:31,050
You're going to have work to do
that. So that's what, that's what,

2509
02:33:31,740 --> 02:33:33,990
that's what it is. It's
a challenge. It's work.

2510
02:33:33,991 --> 02:33:37,530
But when you have the basic
principles, the, I shouldn't say basic,

2511
02:33:37,531 --> 02:33:42,000
when you have the fundamental principles,
they are going to work well for you.

2512
02:33:42,001 --> 02:33:44,220
And when they're not working well for you,

2513
02:33:44,490 --> 02:33:47,310
don't get mad at the other
person and blame their ego.

2514
02:33:47,460 --> 02:33:52,460
Look at your own ego because you can
adjust and adapt and maneuver and get that

2515
02:33:52,741 --> 02:33:56,940
person disarmed and you can flank
them and then you're going to win.

2516
02:33:57,260 --> 02:34:00,300
But that's so interesting that
all of this question is like that.

2517
02:34:00,330 --> 02:34:03,690
Like it seems like when, like when I
first read it, I was like, oh shoot,

2518
02:34:03,691 --> 02:34:08,250
that's a good question. You know, no one
there. And it is, but in a different way,

2519
02:34:08,251 --> 02:34:10,740
because this question is essentially
what it does. Is it like,

2520
02:34:10,741 --> 02:34:12,750
what do you call it?
Like a strainer or whatever.

2521
02:34:12,750 --> 02:34:16,170
Like it shifted it SIF see strains out.

2522
02:34:16,500 --> 02:34:18,490
The guy who's not doing extreme ownership,

2523
02:34:18,670 --> 02:34:21,070
see how it says if they're
both exercising it,

2524
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:22,450
but if they're going against each other,

2525
02:34:22,451 --> 02:34:25,120
that means there's some extreme ownership
not being practiced. Somewhere in here,

2526
02:34:25,200 --> 02:34:28,180
we didn't know, but we're going
to, we can find out. You know,

2527
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:29,650
who's going again to kind of thing.

2528
02:34:29,651 --> 02:34:32,290
If they're both going against each
other or maybe they both have it.

2529
02:34:32,320 --> 02:34:35,590
You know what? There's always gonna
be one person. Well, not always,

2530
02:34:35,591 --> 02:34:40,591
but there's usually me
one person that is got it.

2531
02:34:41,380 --> 02:34:44,100
Okay. That understands it and that's
going to be working in this guy.

2532
02:34:44,101 --> 02:34:48,880
He's just so good and so smooth.
It's so tactical and they're going to win.

2533
02:34:48,910 --> 02:34:52,330
And that other person that's like,
that's right. You know why we're winning.

2534
02:34:52,331 --> 02:34:54,640
Cause I got extreme
ownership going on and I,

2535
02:34:54,940 --> 02:34:57,520
I took ownership of this project and you
want the guy says they're good. Real.

2536
02:34:57,580 --> 02:35:02,110
The real leader is like, absolutely
man, you did a great job with that.

2537
02:35:02,111 --> 02:35:06,070
And meanwhile he knows he just made his
manipulated and flanked him and made it

2538
02:35:06,071 --> 02:35:10,260
happen to the best of the
best for the team. You know,

2539
02:35:10,390 --> 02:35:14,440
just keeping the train going.
That's good. Yeah. Interesting.

2540
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:18,430
Okay. I think we got it. Last
question. Yeah. Just maybe one more,

2541
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:21,640
maybe a jacket.

2542
02:35:22,540 --> 02:35:25,960
Can you talk about fear of
failure in how to overcome it?

2543
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:29,390
Fear of failure.

2544
02:35:31,590 --> 02:35:35,690
So obviously fear of failure can,

2545
02:35:36,400 --> 02:35:38,780
can keep you from taking risk.
Yeah,

2546
02:35:38,790 --> 02:35:43,790
they can leave you just sitting there
paralyzed into not taking any action at

2547
02:35:45,561 --> 02:35:48,590
all.
And obviously that's bad,

2548
02:35:50,780 --> 02:35:51,613
but

2549
02:35:53,090 --> 02:35:58,090
I don't actually want you to
overcome the fear of failure.

2550
02:36:00,020 --> 02:36:04,100
I want,
I want you to be afraid of failure.

2551
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:08,480
Fear of failure is good.
Fear of failure.

2552
02:36:08,600 --> 02:36:11,450
We'll keep you up at night.

2553
02:36:12,650 --> 02:36:17,030
Planning in rehearsing and
going over contingencies.

2554
02:36:17,300 --> 02:36:21,770
Fear of failure will
keep you training hard.

2555
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:27,470
It'll stop you from cutting corners.

2556
02:36:28,820 --> 02:36:29,330
Fear,

2557
02:36:29,330 --> 02:36:34,330
fear of failure will keep you working
and thinking in striving and relentlessly

2558
02:36:36,291 --> 02:36:40,670
trying to be more prepared for battle.

2559
02:36:43,970 --> 02:36:46,910
So I want you to be afraid of failing.

2560
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:49,100
I fear failure,

2561
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:53,330
but more important.

2562
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:57,800
I want you to be horrified.

2563
02:36:59,040 --> 02:37:04,040
I want you to be terrified of sitting
on your ass and doing nothing.

2564
02:37:06,090 --> 02:37:07,740
That is what I want you to be afraid of,

2565
02:37:07,950 --> 02:37:12,950
of waking up in six days or six
weeks or six years or 60 years,

2566
02:37:14,840 --> 02:37:15,200
okay?

2567
02:37:15,200 --> 02:37:17,930
In being no closer to your goal,

2568
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:20,390
you've made no progress.

2569
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:22,693
Yeah,

2570
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:27,230
that is the horror.
That is the nightmare.

2571
02:37:29,100 --> 02:37:32,910
That is what you need
to be truly afraid of

2572
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:36,590
being stagnant.

2573
02:37:41,470 --> 02:37:42,303
So

2574
02:37:43,810 --> 02:37:46,480
get up and go.

2575
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:52,060
Take the risk. Take the
gamble, take the first step,

2576
02:37:52,540 --> 02:37:54,160
take action.

2577
02:37:56,560 --> 02:38:01,560
Don't let another day slip by.

2578
02:38:07,690 --> 02:38:11,560
And I think that's all
I've got for tonight.

2579
02:38:13,230 --> 02:38:16,960
And if you got something
out of the podcast tonight,
you want to hear some more,

2580
02:38:18,760 --> 02:38:21,880
well then maybe you should go ahead
and support the podcast and echo.

2581
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:26,800
How can the troopers out there
best support the podcast? Well,

2582
02:38:26,920 --> 02:38:31,920
one of the or the initial way is to
support yourself at the same time and that

2583
02:38:32,531 --> 02:38:33,880
is to supplement

2584
02:38:36,490 --> 02:38:40,450
on it on it has the best
supplements. Uh, you know,

2585
02:38:40,451 --> 02:38:43,150
it's one thing to say they have the
best supplements because I like them,

2586
02:38:43,360 --> 02:38:47,240
but they have for real, have the
best supplement. Like the legit,

2587
02:38:47,280 --> 02:38:50,440
you read all this stuff about it,
it's straight up the best anyway.

2588
02:38:51,090 --> 02:38:53,440
You want 10% off there.
So support your wallet as well.

2589
02:38:53,441 --> 02:38:56,050
So you're supporting podcasts
yourself and your wallet.

2590
02:38:56,740 --> 02:39:01,280
10% off on it.com/josh. Yep. Solid.

2591
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:06,520
Um, also if you want to passively support,
uh, you can do the Amazon click through.

2592
02:39:06,521 --> 02:39:08,260
That's you got to one of the websites doc,

2593
02:39:08,270 --> 02:39:12,310
podcast.com or chocolate or the chocolate
store is the Amazon link on the top.

2594
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:14,900
Now we have international cause there,
um,

2595
02:39:14,980 --> 02:39:18,160
every once in a while like
who are overseas or you
know, international. But Hey,

2596
02:39:18,161 --> 02:39:22,360
what about this? Cause it's a, it's a long
story, but we have everywhere overseas,

2597
02:39:22,361 --> 02:39:23,500
it's Canada.

2598
02:39:24,570 --> 02:39:29,570
Basically I started the ones that
people have actually told me,

2599
02:39:30,250 --> 02:39:32,440
you know, like, Hey, we're here
in the UK, we want to, you know,

2600
02:39:32,540 --> 02:39:35,110
be done with the thing or
whatever. And yeah, so,

2601
02:39:35,140 --> 02:39:38,980
so I did those and so those are
up on both websites as well.

2602
02:39:39,010 --> 02:39:43,850
Thanks for hitting me up with that by
the way. Um, overseas support? Yes.

2603
02:39:44,440 --> 02:39:48,940
Yes, fully. So dope. And
also speaking of Amazon, the,

2604
02:39:48,970 --> 02:39:53,410
the new trooper tool, that's
pretty, it's a cool little tool.

2605
02:39:53,560 --> 02:39:55,030
Thanks again Brady for that one.

2606
02:39:55,720 --> 02:39:59,110
It genius and Jujitsu student by the way.

2607
02:40:01,480 --> 02:40:03,800
Nonetheless, like this tool,
you just click it. You got it.

2608
02:40:03,810 --> 02:40:07,570
There's a link to it on things called
the called the true chuck podcast trooper

2609
02:40:07,571 --> 02:40:11,470
tool. Chrome extension. That's what it's
called. Awesome. You Click on the thing,

2610
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:14,100
you just like you clean thing
if you want and you click

2611
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:15,990
on the thing,
it shows up as a little icon.

2612
02:40:16,070 --> 02:40:20,160
Jack was head and you can even hide that
if you don't want it on your browser or

2613
02:40:20,161 --> 02:40:22,740
whatever. You just hide it if you
don't want it there. But it looks,

2614
02:40:22,741 --> 02:40:24,540
I think it's kind of cool. It's
up there or whatever. Anyway,

2615
02:40:24,930 --> 02:40:27,060
it helps you go to aid,
makes you good at Amazon.

2616
02:40:27,090 --> 02:40:30,600
It helps it go through the affiliate
link so you don't have to go through the

2617
02:40:30,601 --> 02:40:33,170
website anymore. Does it automatically
for you? Don't think it. Say it.

2618
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:37,290
Say some time. Uh, also, you know,

2619
02:40:37,291 --> 02:40:40,950
of course subscribed to
the iTunes and youtube.

2620
02:40:41,640 --> 02:40:43,560
I think we're going to pump
some more value in youtube,

2621
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:47,580
but some outtakes on there. I think I like
that. I like where you're coming from.

2622
02:40:47,610 --> 02:40:51,480
Yeah. I subscribe to the Youtube, the
youtube channel. That would be cool.

2623
02:40:51,870 --> 02:40:55,410
So we know that you're out there and
you're going to receive these things that

2624
02:40:56,160 --> 02:41:00,220
echo was putting together.
Yeah. And then also the uh,

2625
02:41:00,780 --> 02:41:04,270
the Jocko podcast store.
Yeah. If you like shirts,

2626
02:41:04,290 --> 02:41:09,050
if you were sure it wasn't Jocko store
chocolate store.com Jocko store.com. Yup.

2627
02:41:09,360 --> 02:41:11,230
Some cool t shirts.
I still,

2628
02:41:11,330 --> 02:41:15,300
I their eyes delivered yet
to see one in the wild.

2629
02:41:15,810 --> 02:41:16,920
Not someone I know.

2630
02:41:17,700 --> 02:41:20,910
So I'm looking forward to seeing
that somewhere in the world,

2631
02:41:21,270 --> 02:41:23,280
somewhere on planet earth.

2632
02:41:23,640 --> 02:41:28,110
I am thoroughly enjoying the pictures
that people sent their awesome,

2633
02:41:28,670 --> 02:41:31,340
you know what's funny? The,
the, the Heather Gray, right?

2634
02:41:32,210 --> 02:41:35,190
Gray like that's the kind of shirt like
you know, a lot of lighter colored shirt,

2635
02:41:35,220 --> 02:41:38,370
they get real, um, like
dark. If you sweat in them.

2636
02:41:39,690 --> 02:41:42,630
There'll be like pictures where, I don't
even know why I think this is funny,

2637
02:41:42,631 --> 02:41:45,570
but it's interesting because the other
one is charcoal gray. That's a dark gray.

2638
02:41:45,571 --> 02:41:48,330
So they'll be like, yeah,
I got my disability to, and
they see the bottom line.

2639
02:41:48,330 --> 02:41:51,550
It looks like a stripe. I'm like, wait,
what? That's weird how the lighting is.

2640
02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:53,460
So there's a stripe on
the bottom of your shirt,

2641
02:41:53,940 --> 02:41:56,070
but it's not the charcoal gray
one. It's the, you know, they,

2642
02:41:56,340 --> 02:42:00,360
they were getting after it of getting
after it is very much so. Anyway.

2643
02:42:00,361 --> 02:42:04,740
I know why I thought that was funny,
but it's, it looks funny. Not Funny,

2644
02:42:04,741 --> 02:42:05,521
like I'm laughing at them,

2645
02:42:05,521 --> 02:42:08,040
but it's interesting how it looks
like a shirt then it's like an optical

2646
02:42:08,041 --> 02:42:10,860
illusion. Anyway. Chocolate store.com.

2647
02:42:10,890 --> 02:42:15,000
There's some other shirts on there if
you like them. Coffee mugs and stickers.

2648
02:42:15,660 --> 02:42:18,480
Awesome bumper stick.
Also,

2649
02:42:18,720 --> 02:42:22,860
if you like the podcast and you
want more of this information,

2650
02:42:22,861 --> 02:42:25,800
there's a book that I wrote
with my brother Leif Babin.

2651
02:42:25,801 --> 02:42:27,150
It's called extreme ownership.

2652
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:32,730
You can order it through Amazon or
you can get anywhere books are sold.

2653
02:42:32,731 --> 02:42:34,260
It's available in hard cover,

2654
02:42:34,261 --> 02:42:37,890
digital and audio format and the audio
format and Lafe and I actually read so

2655
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:39,000
get some of that.

2656
02:42:39,570 --> 02:42:43,710
If you want to talk to echo and I,

2657
02:42:43,890 --> 02:42:48,840
you can find us on the
interwebs at Twitter.

2658
02:42:49,380 --> 02:42:53,610
Echo is an echo.
Charles and I am at jockowillink.

2659
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:58,080
We're also on the Facebooky
and some of that Instagram,

2660
02:42:58,800 --> 02:43:03,630
I got a snapchat thing,
I signed up for it or whatever,

2661
02:43:03,930 --> 02:43:08,280
but I haven't done anything with it
yet. Yeah, so I got to explore that.

2662
02:43:08,310 --> 02:43:12,850
But man,
the social media stuff takes time and,

2663
02:43:12,910 --> 02:43:17,350
and I can't, if you want me find
me on Twitter, that's the best way.

2664
02:43:17,680 --> 02:43:20,350
Ask Your questions on Twitter.
Hit me up on Twitter.

2665
02:43:21,160 --> 02:43:25,360
That's the most common thing that I use.
I do.

2666
02:43:25,390 --> 02:43:29,140
I do check Facebook. I mean I read
everything that has ever been sent to me.

2667
02:43:29,320 --> 02:43:30,050
I've read,

2668
02:43:30,050 --> 02:43:34,060
I might not have responded to it because
I can't literally can't respond to

2669
02:43:34,061 --> 02:43:36,160
every single thing that gets sent to me.
Uh,

2670
02:43:36,910 --> 02:43:41,080
which is what's nice about on Twitter. I
can just hit that. I like it, you know,

2671
02:43:41,230 --> 02:43:44,170
so that people know like, oh he
read it cool on Facebook. I read it,

2672
02:43:44,171 --> 02:43:49,170
but there's nothing to press to
say I read your thing. So, um,

2673
02:43:49,690 --> 02:43:52,580
maybe I should figure something
out like that. But anyways, it,

2674
02:43:52,720 --> 02:43:55,870
you're solid on Twitter,
you get back to people and stuff,

2675
02:43:55,871 --> 02:43:58,660
which is cool cause there's some
people you can tell it's not them,

2676
02:43:58,750 --> 02:44:00,460
it's like their,
their social media.

2677
02:44:01,190 --> 02:44:05,980
Me and I was just out where I just was,
there was very limited internet,

2678
02:44:05,981 --> 02:44:08,980
so I was able to get like
a tweet out in the morning,

2679
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:13,720
a couple of weeks out in the morning. But
when I'd go to start responding, it was,

2680
02:44:13,721 --> 02:44:17,560
you know, three minutes to, to
look at the tweet from somebody.

2681
02:44:17,740 --> 02:44:20,410
So I'm backed up right
now for like five days,

2682
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:23,530
four days behind or something like
that. Five days behind actually. Yeah.

2683
02:44:23,590 --> 02:44:26,260
Let's see. You mean? You're saying
that like that you're like backed up.

2684
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:29,980
It means like your,
you know your engagement and that's good,

2685
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:34,780
but even then I was reading and I do,
man, if you send me something on Twitter,

2686
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:38,500
I'm going to see it. You want to read
it. I might not respond to it directly,

2687
02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:42,100
but I might have had a day
actually more than once too,

2688
02:44:42,101 --> 02:44:45,910
but I'm remembering a very specific
time a day where I wasn't going to go to

2689
02:44:45,911 --> 02:44:49,350
Jujitsu. I wasn't going to go. It was,
you know, today's the breath, dare what?

2690
02:44:49,400 --> 02:44:52,180
I Dunno, whatever. I wasn't going to
go. We call it, we call that weakness.

2691
02:44:53,050 --> 02:44:56,050
Maybe call it what you want.
Nonetheless,

2692
02:44:57,070 --> 02:44:59,120
when you see pictures of,
I saw,

2693
02:44:59,260 --> 02:45:02,740
I don't know that the name
of the specific person,

2694
02:45:02,741 --> 02:45:05,500
but I saw a picture first
day of Jujitsu and I'm like,

2695
02:45:05,530 --> 02:45:08,800
you know how you get that feeling when
like let's say you weren't at Jujitsu and

2696
02:45:08,801 --> 02:45:12,160
I took a picture of me on the Mat
saying I'm here without Jocko.

2697
02:45:12,700 --> 02:45:14,950
I'll do that every once in a while to
like my friends or I'm here without

2698
02:45:15,080 --> 02:45:17,230
Jacquelyn's. You kind of like,
you have this feeling like, Dang,

2699
02:45:17,231 --> 02:45:20,980
I wish I was there right now just to
whatever. I kinda got that feeling,

2700
02:45:21,370 --> 02:45:23,530
that weird competitiveness you
were talking about earlier.

2701
02:45:24,250 --> 02:45:28,660
I want to be there with you maybe,
maybe a little bit, oh by the way,

2702
02:45:28,661 --> 02:45:31,210
I don't know if you knew this,
you know like guys will be like,

2703
02:45:31,211 --> 02:45:33,940
Hey I want to come visit you at,
at the gym or went on. Right.

2704
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:37,970
And to me it's a guy showed up when I was
out of town. Yeah. And that's, you know,

2705
02:45:38,130 --> 02:45:41,380
I I I say the days like I go on this
these days typically and whatever.

2706
02:45:41,381 --> 02:45:44,140
So it just hit me up, whether it be on
Twitter or whatever, if you're in town.

2707
02:45:44,141 --> 02:45:47,260
And he did. And cause he, the
reason that's significant,

2708
02:45:47,261 --> 02:45:51,670
one of the main reasons what I said
too, was he from Arizona? So Arizona,

2709
02:45:51,671 --> 02:45:56,100
his name is ab Ab. The man
showed up rolled money. Yeah.

2710
02:45:56,190 --> 02:45:58,960
So cause a lot of people in life,
I'm not saying just on Twitter,

2711
02:45:58,961 --> 02:46:02,490
I'm just seeing in life they always
will be like, Hey, oh you do? Yeah.

2712
02:46:02,500 --> 02:46:05,920
I'm going to combine,
you can show me or all roll or whatever.

2713
02:46:05,921 --> 02:46:10,400
And I would say a good 95 to
99% of the time they don't,

2714
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:11,780
they don't come.
Yeah.

2715
02:46:11,781 --> 02:46:15,110
Well a lot of times they're hitting you
up from love plays her farther than the

2716
02:46:15,111 --> 02:46:19,160
way than, than Arizona. I'm even talking
about like before the podcast and stuff,

2717
02:46:19,161 --> 02:46:24,070
I'm saying like your friends, you know.
Oh, just, Oh, whatever, you know. Yeah.

2718
02:46:24,740 --> 02:46:26,450
I'm going to come check it
out. Sounds cool. You know,

2719
02:46:26,690 --> 02:46:31,100
and they never had this dude
rolled before. Ab Ab ab. Um,

2720
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:35,530
was he uh, he's a uh, yeah,

2721
02:46:35,540 --> 02:46:39,500
he was like a three straight white
belt or something like that. Yeah.

2722
02:46:39,980 --> 02:46:44,880
Nice guy. You know, he's cool. What's
up baby man? Thanks for coming. Um,

2723
02:46:47,440 --> 02:46:48,221
yeah.
And,

2724
02:46:48,221 --> 02:46:52,710
and obviously just want to

2725
02:46:52,810 --> 02:46:55,060
give a shout out.
We talked about some soldiers today,

2726
02:46:55,360 --> 02:46:57,400
but I want to give a thanks.
All the police out there.

2727
02:46:57,760 --> 02:47:02,760
I hear a lot from police officers all
over the country and thanks to you guys

2728
02:47:02,801 --> 02:47:06,640
for doing your duty to keep us safe.
Same thing for the firefighters.

2729
02:47:06,641 --> 02:47:08,860
I've actually hearing a lot from five.

2730
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:13,180
There's all kinds of firefighters and all
you guys are protecting us on the home

2731
02:47:13,181 --> 02:47:14,014
front,

2732
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:19,290
obviously much appreciated and then
course the military folks out there,

2733
02:47:19,750 --> 02:47:22,890
especially those that are deployed
right now, taking the fight, hey

2734
02:47:22,930 --> 02:47:23,763
to the enemy,

2735
02:47:25,410 --> 02:47:29,100
be aggressive and crush him and
we'll see you when you get home.

2736
02:47:29,760 --> 02:47:34,760
And finally to all the 12 the
Jocko podcast troopers out there.

2737
02:47:37,860 --> 02:47:42,690
Thank you for the support across the
board with all of us. We appreciate it.

2738
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:47,960
And what we really appreciate more than
anything is you out there in your life

2739
02:47:52,320 --> 02:47:57,030
taking ownership of your
world and getting after it.

2740
02:47:59,220 --> 02:48:03,870
So until next time,
this is echo and Jocko

2741
02:48:05,430 --> 02:48:05,880
