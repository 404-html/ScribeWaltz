1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,070
This is Jocko podcast number
one 51 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,080
Jocko Willink. Good Evening
Echo. Good evening. And

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,930
we haven't done a Q and a for a while
and we're going to roll into a Q and a.

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:19,920
And normally
quite frankly,

5
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:23,340
normally the Q and A's when
we show up for the Q and A's,

6
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:27,150
there's a little bit of a different
atmosphere we'll say, right sir?

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,210
A little bit of levity in the room.
Everything's like, you know, hey,

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,010
we're not going to talk about war.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:35,670
We're not going to be reading
about men being wounded or killed.

10
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:38,520
We're not going to be reading about
some atrocity and hearing what people go

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:40,440
through. We're going to be
answering questions and there's,

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,720
there's a little bit more
just lightheartedness to
the whole thing. Usually.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,400
Sometimes it goes a little bit, you
know, one way or the other. But this is,

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,500
there's just a little bit of a different
situation in the recording room right

15
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,580
now because we just did a,
uh,

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,410
and this is kind of surprising cause we
just did a warrior kid podcast and in

17
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:06,411
the warrior kid podcast I answer
questions from kids for Uncle Jake.

18
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:11,760
And those are all, you know, kind of just
little neat little kid questions. Hey,

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,790
our cheeseburgers,
good for you and what do I do?

20
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:21,690
And I'm nervous that a Jujitsu tournament
and what do I do when I can't remember

21
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:23,280
how to Spell Mississippi?
You know,

22
00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:27,630
just like these nice little kid questions
and they're fun. And yet, you know,

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,170
I treat them seriously because kids
have serious questions and when you're a

24
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,060
little kid, those are real
problems. Those aren't,

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,930
we laugh at him now you're laughing
at him like, well the Mississippi one.

26
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,510
That's right, you're over there
laughing at the kids' issues.

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,480
But then when I started doing a little
while ago and I started telling these

28
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:46,650
stories from the perspective of
Uncle Jake when Uncle Jake was a kid.

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,600
And some of those are a little bit more,
they're a little bit more serious,

30
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,600
but there's always a very big lesson
to be learned because my goal with the

31
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:59,601
stories from Uncle Jake is that kids
can end up understanding how uncle Jake

32
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,110
kind of formulated his values as a man.

33
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,810
And we've talked about a bunch of
different ones of those. Uh, but anyways,

34
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:11,010
the one that I did today,

35
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:16,011
and what's interesting is all these
stories are kind of based on their based

36
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,520
loosely around, around things that
I've experienced. And this is very,

37
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,480
some of them very loosely,

38
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:25,320
some of them not so loose on things
that I've actually experienced,

39
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:27,630
things that I went through
because I'm not uncle Jake,

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,660
but I have some similar experiences that
uncle Jake has had along the way in any

41
00:02:32,901 --> 00:02:33,870
ways today.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,820
I wanted to make the point to kids that
the decisions that they make in their

43
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,520
life are, they have a big impact, right?

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,130
And if you make little
decisions when you're a kid,

45
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,860
you start making bad decisions.
When you're a little kid,

46
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,780
those bad decisions eventually add up.
And if you make good decisions,

47
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,300
those decisions will add up and you'll,
in the one case,

48
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,040
you'll end up with good things.
If you make good decisions,

49
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,350
if you make bad decisions,
you'll end up in a bad situation.

50
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,310
And I told this story from Uncle Jake's
perspective about uncle Jake's best

51
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,480
friend when he was growing up.

52
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,750
And it was a kid named Jeff
and they were best friends.

53
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:08,980
They did everything together and they,

54
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,280
they played and they did practical jokes
and they laughed and had a great time.

55
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,910
And eventually Jeff starts
making some bad decisions.

56
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:18,700
He gets in trouble in class and he gets
in more trouble than he gets suspended

57
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:21,970
from recess and just, and then
the next thing you know, he starts

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,430
really going down a bad path and
starts using drugs and alcohol.

59
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,110
And eventually, and again, I, this
is a long, this is not a long story,

60
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,230
but it's probably takes about 10 minutes
to tell on the podcast on the warrior

61
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,064
could podcast.

62
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,050
And then eventually I leave high school,

63
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,260
we graduated from high school and I kind
of talk about seeing him and this is

64
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,110
what's true. Like so this is true,
so this is based on true story.

65
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:49,990
I had a best friend when I was a kid.
His name was Jeff. He was an awesome kid.

66
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:54,400
He was funny. And what? He's one of those
kids, I've talked about this before,

67
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,750
like some kids, they have a
little spark to them. Yeah,

68
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,590
and it's not a lot is very few kids,
they have this little spark.

69
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:04,690
They've got this little thing
about them that you go, okay,

70
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:09,310
that person has something now that
spark doesn't guarantee anything.

71
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,181
In fact,

72
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:14,170
that spark can be a problem because that
spark and catch fire and it can be an

73
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,910
uncontrollable fire or it can be a fire
that can be used to fuel and grow and

74
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,780
create awesome things and you don't
really know. You can't really control it.

75
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,360
That person has to have
control of that sparkle.

76
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,930
Jeff was one of those kids that had like
this sparked to him. He was charismatic.

77
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:32,320
He was funny. He was smart, he
was witty, he was courageous,

78
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,410
but he just,
for whatever reason,

79
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,580
had like a little spin to them that
didn't mind getting in trouble.

80
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:42,430
It's almost like an attitude like,
hey, these guys can't hold me down.

81
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,230
And so, you know, when
we were in fifth grade,

82
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,250
it was actually in fifth grade where we
sat next to each other every day and we

83
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:52,030
would start, you know, we,

84
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,410
we would just hang out all the time and
laugh and eventually he started getting

85
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,620
in trouble and I didn't write
and I would get in some trouble,

86
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
but he would cross the line and he
crossed the line to where all of a sudden,

87
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:02,951
you know,

88
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:07,951
he would get it sent to the principal's
office and be that kind of trouble one

89
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,980
level above that kind of trouble I
would get in, which is like, hey,

90
00:05:10,981 --> 00:05:15,010
you get yelled at, you gotta
be quiet. Hey, you know,

91
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:18,850
you go sit in the corner to those things
I got, but I didn't cross the line,

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,940
which is hey, I'm not, I'm
out of control in the class.

93
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm so disruptive that you
got to get me out of class.

94
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,270
I'd never crossed that line.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,480
He started crossing that
line and eventually,

96
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,720
you know, like, and I told
him the story, you know,

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,320
he started using drugs and
alcohol and I thought about it,

98
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:37,960
what do I want to talk about? Drugs and
alcohol and the warrior can podcast.

99
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,480
And then I thought to myself,
yes I do.

100
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,870
Because if you don't think kids hear
about drugs and alcohol right now when

101
00:05:43,871 --> 00:05:46,990
they're seven years old, eight years
old, nine years old, you're wrong,

102
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,160
drugs are out there.

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,570
It's a different world and you might as
well tell them when they're young that

104
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,450
these things are problematic.
Well with Jeff, you know,

105
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:57,770
Jeff went down the path of starting to,
you know,

106
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,570
smoke and drink and and all that stuff,
doing drugs and I didn't, you know,

107
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,330
he started getting into
that kind of thing.

108
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:09,350
I started getting into like hardcore
music and being like disciplined and all

109
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:13,070
that stuff, which again, I call
it what you want, call it a trend,

110
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:17,270
call it me conforming to something
or whatever you want to call it.

111
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,730
But that's what I did. That's
what I got into. I related to it.

112
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,630
Let me put it to that way.
So eventually Jeff becomes like a burnout,

113
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,100
you know what I mean? He, he becomes,
um, yeah, like a burnout, you know,

114
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,930
you cut classes and he, you know,
just kind of went down that spiral.

115
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,170
And the weird thing is we were such
good friends when we were kids that we

116
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,720
didn't not like each other anymore.
You know,

117
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:41,840
I didn't like have a falling out with him.
We just,

118
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,190
we just went our separate ways.

119
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,470
And so when I would see him in school
where I'd see him in the hallway or I'd

120
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:53,300
see him in town, you know, we
would talk and you could see,

121
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,640
I could see in his eyes,
like in his eyes,

122
00:06:55,641 --> 00:07:00,620
like he knew he was going in the wrong
direction and we would still laugh and we

123
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,550
would still have a good time.
We would joke about things and then we'd,

124
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,340
we'd walk away from each other and
he'd keep kept going down the path.

125
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:10,010
He was going down and I kept going
down the path I was going on.

126
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,140
And as time went by, you know, he just
was a complete burnout. I thought,

127
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:17,120
I don't even remember if he
graduated high school or not.

128
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,170
I graduated high school and I
joined the navy and you know,

129
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,910
I was going to go try and be a seal.
That was my big, big goal. Right.

130
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,060
And he was going to do
whatever he was going to do.

131
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,410
And the last time I saw him again,

132
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,590
like I remember I saw him
and it was like in my mind,

133
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:39,860
and it wasn't quite mature enough
to really recognize what I,

134
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,390
what I saw like at the time. But
as I look back on, it was like,

135
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,570
there was like this element of sadness
for him seeing that I was gone.

136
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,980
I was like, for lack of a
better word, like getting
away. Right. I was going to go,

137
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,700
I was going to go and do something right.
And he was gonna not,

138
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,070
and you could see that.
And at this point,

139
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,780
like I don't even know if he
could have gotten the military.

140
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:06,560
He'd been on quite a bit of trouble and
had used a lot of drugs and I don't even

141
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:09,880
know if he could have gotten in the
military at this point. So, and,

142
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,260
but when we were little kids,
mind you,

143
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,200
we were running around and
playing BB gun wars and you know,

144
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,980
setting up forts and run around
in camouflage outfits, you know,

145
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:19,581
that's what we're doing.

146
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:23,060
So it's like I was going to do that for
real and he was going to keep doing what

147
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:26,330
he was doing, which was not good
stuff. And it's when I saw him for the,

148
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,120
for the last time,
you know,

149
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:33,470
like we shook hands and again,
like I could see in his eyes this,

150
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,650
this element of sadness that

151
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,930
he was doing what he, his life had
gone in this direction in my life,

152
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:44,420
had gone in this other
direction and he was,

153
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,880
I don't even want to use the term jealous
because I don't think he was jealous.

154
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,710
He wasn't jealous and
all he was absolutely,

155
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,610
I was actually like kind of proud
you could see in his eyes like, man,

156
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:55,470
that's awesome. And he said
like, good luck. You know,

157
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:59,760
and we show hands and at bro Hugged
and then I, then I just, you know,

158
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,070
I left to join the navy
and went to bootcamp and,

159
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:07,130
and I remember I was in seal training
and I was probably a month or two into

160
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:11,490
seal training. And I
talked to my mom and, um,

161
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,000
she told me that, that
this guy, this Guy Jeff,

162
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:19,260
who had been my best friends from probably
first grade through like fifth grade.

163
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,960
And then, uh, like I said, it's separated,

164
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,430
but he killed himself and 19
years old he killed himself.

165
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,970
And, and so in the, in the
story that Uncle Jake tells,

166
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:33,580
I don't tell that part the talk about
suicide, but I just say that he,

167
00:09:33,581 --> 00:09:38,280
he died and he died from drugs and
alcohol, which indirectly is true.

168
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,421
Um,
you know,

169
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:43,710
that's what killed him is that he was
doing drugs and drinking and he wasn't

170
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,320
making clear decisions and
went down that path of,

171
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,510
of depression and ended up
killing himself. And, and
I remember going, you know,

172
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,410
I was going through seal training.

173
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:57,120
So I was definitely
shocked and saddened by it.

174
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,140
And I had to do work and
it was one of those things,

175
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:05,190
but as I looked back on it,
like these are just little tiny decisions.

176
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:09,150
Like I made a decision. He
made a decision, I made a
decision. He made a decision,

177
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,680
I made a positive decision about
something. He made a negative decision.

178
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,300
I made a good decision.
He made a bad decision.

179
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,770
These aren't huge decisions
that I'm talking about. Yeah,

180
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:23,030
but it was these little tiny decisions
that added up over time and I think a lot

181
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:27,750
of times kids, they don't recognize that.
They don't recognize that these little,

182
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,110
I mean sure, if you make a
one big bad decision, you go
drinking and driving. Yup,

183
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,870
you're right. You can, you can kill
yourself. You can kill someone else.

184
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,090
You can ruin your whole
life in one bad decision.

185
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,550
But where did that one
bad decision came from?

186
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:41,100
It came from a bunch of bad decisions.
It came from hanging around with them,

187
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,920
bad people. It came with starting
to drink in the first place.

188
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,140
That came with even having the attitude
that I can get away with stuff.

189
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:49,560
Like there's a lot of little bad decisions
that led up to this one bad, big,

190
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,380
bad decision that actually ends
up putting you in a bad way.

191
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,130
So that's the story that I just
told on the warrior kicked podcasts.

192
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:03,810
And again, I know it's kind of a heavy
story. In fact, it's a very heavy story.

193
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,010
And that's another thing with
like, as I said to myself, well,

194
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,510
should I talk about,

195
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,050
should I say that he ended up
in jail or something like that.

196
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,360
And as I said to myself, no,
like this is the reality of life.

197
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,820
And if kids are not taught the
reality of life again, yeah.

198
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,300
I'm not trying to smack him in the
face with it. I'm not trying to,

199
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,040
to make them paranoid,
you know?

200
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:33,130
And that's kind of why I thought the
suicide part was a step too far. Yeah.

201
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,030
But you know, it's like in
Mikey and the dragons, I,

202
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:40,920
I talk about how there's dragons
that are ready to kill. And luckily,

203
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,560
you know,
I'm publishing,

204
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:47,910
I own the publishing company that's
making this up because a lot of my editors

205
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,570
probably wouldn't like to hear that a
normal children's editor doesn't want to

206
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:58,390
hear killing. Right. And as
[inaudible] and also in the book, the,

207
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,560
the king dies, right? The
king is dead and he's,

208
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,770
there's a funeral form.
And that was another thing like,

209
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,590
well how do you really want to
talk about that with little kids?

210
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,310
And as I asked my that self that
question for the first time,

211
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I answered it in like a millisecond with
there's kids out there whose dad dies

212
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:19,720
when they're five years old whose mom
dies when they're seven years old,

213
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,260
whose grandma dies, who's dog
dies. Like death is part of life.

214
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,340
And to pretend that it doesn't exist and
hope that your kids are just gonna one

215
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:29,290
day figured out, that's not,
that's not the right thing to do.

216
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:33,530
They should understand it.
And so the,

217
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,290
the last part about this thing about Jeff
was,

218
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,130
you know, again, he had this spark, he
was funny and he was just a really good,

219
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,900
awesome guy.
And when I got done,

220
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,850
you know what I did? I
did like the typical, um,
whatever, 11 o'clock at night,

221
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,710
sitting at the computer thing,

222
00:12:53,711 --> 00:12:56,410
when I got done writing this
thing and I just googled him,

223
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,370
I just googled them and just
googled his name is full name. And

224
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,590
it was the weirdest thing
because when I googled him,

225
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,150
there was nothing,
there was nothing,

226
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,010
no nothing, not a ne, you
couldn't his name, no obituary,

227
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,020
no nothing,
just nothing.

228
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,480
And that kind of shook me up a little bit.

229
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,680
And the way it shakes me up as
it shakes me up in the fact that

230
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,410
that guy had more intelligence than me.

231
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,500
He had more talent than me.
He was more charismatic than me.

232
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,650
He had all these things that were
better than me and yet Google,

233
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:46,060
which I don't know if you ever Google
because I Google a lot of stuff all the

234
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:49,750
time. Cause I, I googled, you know, people
that were in the military, I Google, uh,

235
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,480
old authors, poets, um, people
that wrote some random, like I'll,

236
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,060
I'll find online, some letter from
some lance corporal in World War II.

237
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,300
I'll Google that person and guess what,
that person will,

238
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,160
there'll be an article about them,
there'll be,

239
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:06,850
there'll be his obituary about what
he did with his life. And that's,

240
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:08,080
that's what about his wife.

241
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:12,850
And then his wife died in 1968 and she
had done and so you can get so much

242
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,120
information about just anyone,
anyone.

243
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,020
And so I Google my friend
Jeff and there's nothing,

244
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,533
nothing.

245
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,100
And that's a person that Jeff had,

246
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:28,570
he gone down the right path.

247
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,320
He would have left a giant mark on
the world and would have done a lot of

248
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:37,000
positive things and done beautiful things
in the world and to think that it's

249
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,250
all gone and it's all lost.

250
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,820
It's lost and there's not
a damn thing about them.

251
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,290
So teach your kids to make the
right decisions is what I'm saying.

252
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,300
Yeah. So, so much for the, uh,

253
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,190
like I said so much for the levity of the,

254
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:58,470
of the situation or of the podcast.

255
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,380
Oh yeah. I mean, yeah,

256
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,750
it's crazy how like, you
know, obviously on it,

257
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:06,650
I didn't know Jeff,

258
00:15:06,651 --> 00:15:11,210
but like how you say you were
talking earlier how you know,

259
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:15,720
if you would have made maybe even
three, three good decisions, you know,

260
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,370
because like these problems like drugs
and alcohol and stuff like that as an

261
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:22,430
individual problem, that's not
the maker of the breaker in there.

262
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,260
It's like everything put together.
You know,

263
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,040
there's people who were successful that
may struggle with drugs and alcohol even

264
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:31,070
for a little bit, for a long
time, ongoing like, you know,

265
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,640
you don't have to die if you make the
decision to do the mistake in my opinion,

266
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,880
but to do drugs and drink alcohol,
you know,

267
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,730
or have that kind of holds you back or
whatever. You don't have to die from that.

268
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,960
It's like everything,
you know,

269
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,260
and he could have been potentially like
massively successful tonal just because

270
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:56,080
of decisions.

271
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,070
That's the,

272
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,480
that's the horrible thing about it is you
just see the waste of human potential.

273
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,530
I guess. That's to me is the,
is a horrible thing. And I
got these great memories.

274
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,760
Like I got 'em right now, I can
remember doing things with him. And,

275
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,660
and when you're with someone like that
and you're almost like a spectator to

276
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,950
their life, like you're getting to
watch them, you get to go like, wow,

277
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:25,450
look at what he's doing. This is crazy. Oh
Wow. Look at that. Look how funny he is.

278
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,550
You get to be a spectator and you
appreciate it. I did. I appreciate it.

279
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,070
And right now I look back and I think
about how funny and, and you know,

280
00:16:33,071 --> 00:16:35,050
I think about any random,
you know,

281
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:40,150
standup comedian or someone on a Saturday
night live or something like that.

282
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:42,640
And it's like, yeah, no, he would
have been awesome on that show.

283
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,800
He would've been hilarious on that show.
But never going to happen. It's not,

284
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,720
doesn't exist. And yeah, so,

285
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,620
so those little decisions that people
make and that kids make, especially,

286
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,100
yeah. You know what's weird too is
when you're 19 years old, think about,

287
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:04,120
think about how much you thought you
knew when you were 19 and how much you

288
00:17:04,121 --> 00:17:08,770
actually know. You knew when you
were 19 it's, it's, it's a pathetic,

289
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:13,750
it's, it's, you know, so
little when you're 19 you know,

290
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,130
so little when you're 19

291
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,180
yeah man, feel like you
kind of know, well I dunno,

292
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:24,800
people are different. But
Man, even 29 for sure.

293
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:25,880
I feel like I didn't really know

294
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,200
well I I every five years that you look
back you realize that you didn't know

295
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:34,490
anything five years ago and maybe someone
will chime in and tell me that when

296
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:39,380
you're 72 you're, you feel pretty good
about what you know. But I don't think so.

297
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,880
I don't think so.

298
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,870
I think it's just always constantly
looking back five years and think to

299
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,490
yourself, and you know, I've
said before, it was like,

300
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:50,700
I think when you get to be at some point,
it's some, some decade along there,

301
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:53,610
35 40 you at least say,

302
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,210
I know I don't know everything.

303
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,820
And that is like the beginning of knowing
something. Because when you're like,

304
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,320
like you said, when you're 19 you know
you think you would know everything.

305
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,480
When you're 23 you think
you know everything.

306
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:07,890
When you're 26 you think
you know everything.

307
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,350
When you're 31 you still
think you know everything.

308
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,740
It's not until you actually look up.

309
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:17,700
Maybe that's 35 maybe that's 37 maybe
some people get it younger where they

310
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:20,550
realize, you know what, I don't know
everything and I need to learn more.

311
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,210
So there you go. Tina
learning more. Q and a.

312
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,840
People have some questions.

313
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,650
Let's see if Jocko as the answers.
I don't,

314
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,730
I don't necessarily have the
answers the no, but I have,

315
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,270
I will be able to give my assessment.
Sure.

316
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,950
I will say this and I just got done
telling Pete this. Sure. Yesterday,

317
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,540
and I probably have told you this before.

318
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,680
If I ever tell you I know something
100% then it's factually true,

319
00:18:56,550 --> 00:19:01,230
but I do that so rarely. It's
very rare that I say, hey,

320
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:06,300
here's the, here's the answer. I
probably do that. I do that very,

321
00:19:06,301 --> 00:19:10,380
very Seldomly. If you hear
me say that, go with it.

322
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,500
It's correct. Won't barely
hear me. You probably,

323
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,900
you may have never heard me
say that up until this point.

324
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,160
Not that I can remember. Yeah. I
very rarely will say, hey, look,

325
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,050
I know this all 100% I used to say once
every, maybe twice, every six months,

326
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:28,800
like when I was in the seal teams, I would
every once in a while I'd have to say,

327
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:33,080
listen man, I'm telling you this is
how you want to do this. You should.

328
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,770
This is how you should do
this. I'm telling you, you
do it this way. Very seldom.

329
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,740
Most of the time I'd say, look,
this is what I think you should do,

330
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,420
but it's your decision. You can
do what you want. All right. Well,

331
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,330
so I will give my assessment.
I'll give my best possible.

332
00:19:48,331 --> 00:19:50,520
And the other thing is
these questions are,

333
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,630
there's not a lot of detail to them often,
or there's a ton of detail,

334
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:57,570
but even on a ton of detail isn't
like, like, let me talk. Oh,

335
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,250
you got a problem with your boss.
I need to meet your boss,

336
00:19:59,251 --> 00:20:01,980
I need to talk to them. You interact
with them everyday. I don't meet.

337
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,080
So you need to kind of,
you need to kind of modulate and,

338
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,420
and honed the answers to
your particular scenario.

339
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,200
So what do you think about
this particular scenario?

340
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,670
Is it better to work in a mindless job
and make money or is it better to follow

341
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:23,220
your passion and possibly make less money?

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,320
I definitely think the best thing to do
is work at a job that you're passionate

343
00:20:28,321 --> 00:20:33,120
about and make a lot of bunny.
That's, that's the best thing to do.

344
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,880
I do know that one. Uh, that's
not always possible. Any.

345
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,390
And here's something you've
got to be careful of.

346
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:44,640
If you ever heard people talk
about making your hobby, your job,

347
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,450
and generally that's like,
oh, I, if I make my hobby my
job, then I'll enjoy my job.

348
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,080
Right?
There's another way of looking at it.

349
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,240
If you make your hobby your job,

350
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,580
you won't like your hobby anymore.
That's another way of looking at that.

351
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:04,750
So it depends on what kind of like a
Jujitsu instructor. Yeah. Right. Hey,

352
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:06,280
I'll just open my own
school and then I'll just,

353
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,810
I'll just get to do what
I love all day long.

354
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,280
You talked to a lot of Jujitsu
instructors after six years.

355
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,470
They don't even like going to the academy.

356
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:18,490
They don't want to go to the academy
anymore cause it's all is. Ah, yeah.

357
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,010
I don't want to teach to one another
white belt, how to do an arm lock.

358
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:21,844
They're over it.

359
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,720
So it's not necessarily the best thing
to make what you're passionate about.

360
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,900
And there's some people that teach you
to do every single day and they love it

361
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,600
and that's awesome. And so
they've, they've won, right?

362
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,270
Because they're making money,
they're doing,

363
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,110
they're have a good livelihood
and they enjoy doing it. So yeah.

364
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,140
But my goal would be to do
something that I'm passionate about.

365
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,371
At the same time,

366
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:51,970
you've got to set yourself up so that
you're not stuck without any money. Right.

367
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:54,760
Because passion doesn't pay the rent.
I'll tell you a, an example of this,

368
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,190
Greg train. Sure. Years Ago
Greg trained said to me, Hey,

369
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,260
here's my options. I can like kind
of scrape by, teach wrestling,

370
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,380
teach some Jujitsu and
trained to fight or I can go,

371
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,230
I got accepted into this program to be
an x ray technician and he asked me,

372
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:19,480
he's like, what do you, what do you think
I should do this for a long time ago,

373
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,000
it's probably like 10 or 12 years
ago, maybe even longer. Anyways,

374
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,850
he asked me and I said, listen, how
many hours a day do you want to train?

375
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,360
And I said, how many hours a day can
you train? And he's like, I don't know,

376
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:36,310
maybe three or four hours a day.
Okay,

377
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,390
so if you want to do this three or four
hours a day and you're not going to make

378
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:43,870
any money, what are you going to do
with the other whatever, 20 hours a day?

379
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,190
You could actually build a career and
make real money doing the x ray thing and

380
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,550
then you could still easily,
because you work eight hours a day.

381
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:02,050
I was like, I was like, Greg, I work
12 hours a day. I work 14 hours a day.

382
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:02,884
I'm still here training.

383
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,810
You can work an eight hour day and still
train and you can train four hours a

384
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:10,180
day and you can be fine
and you'll have money.

385
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:11,970
You don't have to worry about paying
the rent, you won't have to deal.

386
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,860
We have to buy nice things. You'll have
medical insurance, all those things.

387
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,640
And he made the decision to go to extra
school and he ended up doing great in

388
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:23,380
Jujitsu and doing great in fighting.

389
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,930
And he ended up getting some
injuries that were like,

390
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,670
if he would've just been a fighter,

391
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,610
they would have been really
problematic because you know,

392
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:35,110
he couldn't fight for a long time.
He, so, um, that's the kind of,

393
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,120
that's the kind of judgment
call, right? You can make, um,

394
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,841
now what,

395
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:44,710
what this question is saying though is
can you do something where you make a

396
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:47,840
little less but you're passionate about?
That's,

397
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:49,840
that's pretty easy call
as far as I'm concerned.

398
00:23:49,841 --> 00:23:52,040
If you just make a little bit less,
but you love doing it,

399
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,760
well that's kind of a no
brainer. Yeah, right, isn't it?

400
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,060
Now you've got to ask yourself,
where does that put you in the future?

401
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,550
And then you got to ask yourself,

402
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:06,790
but on the other side is could you do
this job that you don't really like for

403
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:10,070
long enough that you
could make a difference?

404
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,200
Like you could do this job that you
don't really like and you all of a sudden

405
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:15,260
you got a down payment for a
house and then you go buy a house.

406
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:18,590
You see what I'm saying?
Yeah. That's not a bad movie.

407
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,580
Eat a bad move either,
but you could also,

408
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,850
this is where people trap themselves.
They have the job that they didn't like.

409
00:24:25,851 --> 00:24:30,851
They're making a little bit more money
and instead of investing towards getting

410
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:34,400
out of that job and setting themselves
up so where they can do something that

411
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:38,790
they are passionate about, what they do
is they expand their lifestyle. Yeah.

412
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:43,910
That's the big mistake. They expand their
lifestyle and all of a sudden, you know,

413
00:24:43,911 --> 00:24:48,911
they're making $100,000 a year at this
job that they don't really like the other

414
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:49,790
job.

415
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,790
They were going to get $75,000
a year and that that's not bad.

416
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,350
Right. I would probably go for the
thing that I really liked doing.

417
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,530
If it's just a difference of $25,000
that's kind of a no brainer to me.

418
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,960
What does the person do? They say, okay,

419
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,590
well I'll just stay in this job so I can
make enough money to get a down payment

420
00:25:06,591 --> 00:25:09,140
on a house. And then what do
they do? They buy a new car,

421
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,970
they go out to dinner every night.

422
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,840
They spend that extra 25,000 that they
could be putting into saving up for down

423
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:16,670
payment. They spend it on
stuff that they don't need.

424
00:25:16,671 --> 00:25:21,590
They end up with $110,000 lifestyle
while they're making $100,000 a year and

425
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:24,800
they actually go into debt and now they're
further away from the job that they

426
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:27,620
wanted.
So

427
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,790
I guess the answer here is,
and I've said this before,

428
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:36,791
come up with an exit strategy with
contingencies if things go wrong and then

429
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:41,010
plan, save, prepare in the next cute.

430
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,440
Sounds like a good plan. Good take
on it. That's what it sounds like.

431
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,580
The, I found that when you
make your hobby, your career,

432
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,480
a lot of times like when you
have fantasies about doing
your hobby as a critic,

433
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:57,640
let's say I'm a photographer,
right? That's a big one.

434
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:01,090
That's a common one that hurt.
There'll be like,

435
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:03,520
okay cause I like taking pictures
or like, you know, I dunno,

436
00:26:03,521 --> 00:26:06,460
maybe traveling or I dunno, whatever,
whatever. I like taking pictures of,

437
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,840
I like that kind of subject to,

438
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,970
oh but so a lot of things when you're
a creative person or you're into,

439
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:18,610
let's say you make baskets,
you make the awesome baskets,

440
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,050
but to make it your career,

441
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:25,051
a lot of the times it comes with like
50% if not 100% additional chores and

442
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:29,590
tasks,
but running that business.

443
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:33,510
Yeah, I was going to say, yeah, you
like making baskets. Oh yeah. Cool.

444
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,960
And what you end up doing is making
thousands of the same baskets.

445
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,550
They're green with the Easter bunny in it.
And that's what your job is,

446
00:26:41,551 --> 00:26:44,010
to weave that basket over
over everything that you're

447
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,480
doing it for is now gone. And, and
guess what? You have to do it night,

448
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,100
you have to do half to like as a hobby.

449
00:26:50,101 --> 00:26:54,690
That's kind of in my opinion pretty much
the one of the two things that make a

450
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:59,340
hobby so great is because it's fun to do
and you can do it whenever you want as

451
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:01,710
long as you have the time, as long
as you can do it whenever you want.

452
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:03,150
If you don't feel like doing,
if you don't do it,

453
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,050
if you don't feel like golfing tomorrow,
you don't feel like all fine,

454
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,920
how are you going to go? Oh no you don't.
You of course not. You don't have to,

455
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:14,970
but if you love making baskets and you
don't feel like it and you're like, Hey,

456
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:16,920
guess what?
You got to make a thousand of those.

457
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:18,420
I know you don't feel
like even making one.

458
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:21,600
You got to make a thousand now or make
sure they're done or something and you're

459
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:21,990
like,
man,

460
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,570
I used to love this thing now I don't
really like it cause all this pressure

461
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,960
which had nothing to do with my
hobby by the way. Nothing now.

462
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,460
It has everything to do with my hobby.

463
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,060
Now you've got ed and I have
people calling me saying,
hey, where's my basket? Hey,

464
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:36,870
I'm the basket maker. I say
when the basket gets made
kind of thing that's gone.

465
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:41,010
So yeah, so you don't really like it. And
so yeah, you've got the repetitiveness,

466
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,750
the the, the like we call that
could control lack of control,

467
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,480
the pressure pressure.

468
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,520
And then that's not to mention like
day to day chores that allow your hobby

469
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:58,080
activity to be a business
or career or whatever.

470
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,940
Man, it's a lot like
freaking tea, Texas. Oh Man.

471
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:05,270
Taxes doing all. Yeah man.
You know how like when you're,

472
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:08,490
you work at like a job and
the texts are just taken out,

473
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,870
the taxes taken out and all this stuff.
But man, you're weaving baskets, you know,

474
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:17,120
in your, in your new garage or whatever.
Man, you got to do your taxes. All this.

475
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,350
And I don't know man,
there's just a lot more to it.

476
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,980
Would you switch over from
hobby to career? That's true.

477
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,650
So that's my big shout out to my tax guy.

478
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,860
He rock so hard is the best guy ever.
I can dig it.

479
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,880
But yeah, so there's that and then, but
yeah, if you're prepared for that though,

480
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,240
if you're totally prepared for that
or if you kind of like business,

481
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,810
you know that part of it. Cause there's
a lot of chores in business. Yeah.

482
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,580
And if you liked that stuff, oh man,
that can be good. But yeah, it, oh,

483
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,720
and here's the thing too about when
you get a good job, I'm not a good job,

484
00:28:49,721 --> 00:28:52,310
but a high paying job, but you
don't like it. This is why.

485
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,310
This is what I think anyway.

486
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,000
I don't think I've ever had
a junk job that paid a lot.

487
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,890
You just said junk, low paying jobs. Yes.
I had a few of those. Yes, for sure. Um,

488
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:08,040
so well, okay. I wake up, I go
to my job, drag myself to my job,

489
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,850
right.

490
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,540
Drag myself and then I can't wait to get
home and get home and get that paycheck

491
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:15,090
after a week, two weeks or whatever.
You get that huge paycheck.

492
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,850
And then I got to drag
myself to my job again.

493
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,920
Then I go home and I can let me re so
basically your day to day for that junk

494
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:26,250
job is, so John, I need something, I
need pleasure, I need some for sure.

495
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:28,920
Pleasure in my life by that cool new car.
So now,

496
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,670
oh sure I'll drag myself to my job but
at least I'm rolling in that new nice new

497
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,880
car. Or eventually you trap
yourself with that car.

498
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,690
That car is a trap because that becomes
the focus a lot of the times like makeup

499
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,010
and the, I believe so.
This is an interesting

500
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,560
thing I've thought about.
People like to make things,

501
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,980
people like to make things like it's a,
it's a,

502
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:49,990
it's a good feeling to make
something to create something.

503
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,530
And I think a lot of the consumer
attitude comes from the fact that look,

504
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,130
I don't have time to go
and build the desk. Hmm.

505
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,040
I wish I did have time to go build a desk
but I'll just go click on this button

506
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:05,620
and the desk will show up at my house
and it's kind of like I created something

507
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,830
wall. Ah, there it is. And the, and
that gives you that. But the thing is,

508
00:30:11,831 --> 00:30:15,670
it's a, it's a short term.
Gratification is, yeah, the end.

509
00:30:15,671 --> 00:30:18,410
That's why it keeps going because you go,
okay, I really like to make a desperate,

510
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,300
I'm just gonna buy this one.
Or I'd really like to do,

511
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:24,010
you know what I'd love to do is just is
just completely refurbished an old car.

512
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,560
Oh I can't do that, but guess what? I can,

513
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,940
I can just buy a new car and then
enrollment, it feels good for a minute.

514
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,200
But you don't get the pure,

515
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,170
you don't get the deep satisfaction
that you would have gotten had you

516
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:39,040
refurbished the car. Yeah. So
you get, you trap yourself.

517
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,650
So keep your spending in check.
This is another part of this whole deal.

518
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,860
Keep spending in check.
But that spending feels so good.

519
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,330
And then you know how like when you get
depends because there's sometimes when

520
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:54,220
you don't have a lot of money
spending hurts, you know,
it hurts when you're like,

521
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:55,990
I can't separate myself from this money.

522
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,330
Yeah. And you have, you have
a different mindset I think,

523
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:02,290
but I think your average person,
me included, it's like the,

524
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:07,050
the spending hurts when you spend spend
on stuff you need rather than what you'd

525
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:10,080
like want. You know what I'm
saying? So backwards. Oh yeah.

526
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,640
It is so backward in time, but it's a
short term thing for sure. It's like the,

527
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:18,400
the immediate like satisfaction
is like when you got to pay,

528
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,970
let's say you don't really have dental
insurance, right? Or let's say you do,

529
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:24,730
but you still got to pay up or whatever.
You got to spend your money on that.

530
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,600
Let's say it's $1,000 and you have
$1,500 in your bank account, we'll say,

531
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,150
so it doesn't feel good
to spend on dental,

532
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:34,960
but it would have felt good to buy a new
plasma screen TV that you could watch

533
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:39,760
the UFC. Think about it, bro.
When that plasma TV comes
in, you're like, oh my gosh,

534
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,070
I can't wait to hook this up.
This thing is awesome.

535
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:45,730
I'll even put it on my credit card and
pay for that thing over the next 12

536
00:31:45,731 --> 00:31:48,700
months. 50% interest on
this thing. I'll do that.

537
00:31:48,701 --> 00:31:51,880
No problem because of that pleasure
of getting it, but oh, dental,

538
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,150
you mean this too thick will go away.
This is too thick.

539
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:58,030
That's causing me of my green
will go away and then I got it.

540
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,340
You know? Then when it's time to pay
that bill, you're like, it's hard man.

541
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,870
You don't really want it. It's
weird. Chet is backwards. All right,

542
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,760
well like I said,
come up with a plan,

543
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,680
come up with an exit strategy
with contingencies and
then save money and execute

544
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,810
gets on check.
Next question.

545
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,820
How do you suggest setting sop standard
operating procedures where none

546
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,350
currently exist? Yeah,
good question and this is

547
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,860
not going to spend a ton of time on this.
Well,

548
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:34,810
the best way to develop sop says to let
them be developed organically sort of

549
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:38,920
from the people that are actually
doing that task. Whatever it is,

550
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:41,240
and you kind of,
you,

551
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:44,780
you just turn what's actually
happening into an sop.

552
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,900
And then if there's multiple
methods happening for something,

553
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:53,050
you kind of consolidate the methods
into the best way and then test them and

554
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:55,490
then you'll have your sop there.

555
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,630
One thing that you shouldn't do with an
sop is come up with a standard operating

556
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:02,630
procedure inside of a vacuum and then
push it down on the folks below you in the

557
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:06,650
chain of command because they're going
to be, they're going to reject it. Um,

558
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,090
they are going to,

559
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,700
they are going to know a better way of
doing it cause you made it up in a vacuum.

560
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,290
So,
so don't do that.

561
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,060
Now there are some times where let's say
you're going to do something brand new

562
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,240
that's never been done before and
you have to kind of create an sop.

563
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,350
Then if you have to do that, you you
need to kind of explain to the team,

564
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,140
hey listen guys, we've never
done this type of mission before.

565
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:34,880
We've never done this
type of project before.

566
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,480
Here's my best guess at what a standard
operating procedure is going to look

567
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:42,620
like. We're going to try and execute
this, but believe me, it's not perfect.

568
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,010
I'm open to feedback and I
realized that it's going to change,

569
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:49,130
but I want to at least have a
line for us to deviate from.

570
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,740
And actually this is an extreme ownership.

571
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,180
I talked about how we
started organizing the SSC,

572
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,090
the sensitive slight sense
of sight exploitation.

573
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:02,810
It's how we search to buildings and
it's in the book, but when you first,

574
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:03,740
when we first started searching builders,

575
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,990
would everyone just go in and ransack
everything and just throw everything

576
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:10,190
around and it was totally ridiculous and
ineffective and eventually, you know,

577
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:10,611
I said,
okay,

578
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:13,100
we need a standard operating procedure in
my assistant platoon commander. I said,

579
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:15,290
hey, come up with a standard operating
procedure of how we're going to do this.

580
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,060
He did that. And when he did of course,
and it's in the book, people are like, oh,

581
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,150
this is going to take forever. And it was
like, okay listen, we're going to try it.

582
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,100
If there's some adjustments we've
got to make, we'll make them,

583
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,520
but let's at least give it a try
it. And that's what we did. Um,

584
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,320
and one of the best things you can do if
you have to come up with an sop is not

585
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,160
only let it come organically
from the task itself,

586
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,240
but let the people that are actually
doing the task come up with the standard

587
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:43,010
operating procedures.
So if you had,

588
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:45,800
if you had some project that
you did over and over again,

589
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,240
I wouldn't come and say,
Hey, here's what I want,

590
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,330
how I want you to do this project
from now on Echo. I'd say, Hey, echo,

591
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:53,150
since you're doing this all the time,
can you capture what it is you do? And,

592
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,400
and we can take those best practices,

593
00:34:55,401 --> 00:34:58,100
turned them into a standard operating
procedure and get him the whole through

594
00:34:58,101 --> 00:35:01,640
the whole organization. And
you'd say, oh, that's cool.

595
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,880
You had kind of feel some ownership of
that and then you would put together a

596
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:05,570
good plan.

597
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:10,190
So that's pretty straight forward with
the standard operating procedures,

598
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,940
the the main thing is let them
develop, led the team, develop them,

599
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,760
keep an open mind,
don't force him down people's throat.

600
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:25,580
Next question.
I'm a 17 year old.

601
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,740
I'm a blue belt in Jujitsu,

602
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,270
which I received a few days after my
16th birthday and I have ambitions of

603
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:36,170
pursuing Jujitsu professionally and
competing to the highest level possible.

604
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,310
Of course this requires discipline

605
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,030
and commitment.

606
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,030
So during the school term I trained you
to two Monday through Saturday and I

607
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:48,810
weight train on Friday and Sunday.
And when I have time off school,

608
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,880
I trained Jujitsu three times a day.
However,

609
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:55,950
due to my commitment to this
and my refusal to prioritize
the other things over

610
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:56,281
this,

611
00:35:56,281 --> 00:36:00,990
I feel I'm missing out on the social
opportunities of this part of my life.

612
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,160
I Miss Parties and social events in
order to stranger Jitsu and weight train

613
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,580
because I know that I should
have the discipline to do so.

614
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:11,790
However I feel lonely and
isolated because of it.

615
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,730
Is this just weakness or should I make
the occasional exception for a social

616
00:36:17,731 --> 00:36:21,480
event? Once again, love the work you
do. You have an echo. Do it's an hour.

617
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,250
It's helped me immensely.
Thanks from the UK.

618
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,060
All right. The UK. Um, uh, first of
all, I'd just, okay. The hardcore,

619
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:31,500
here's the couple of hardcore answers.
Hardcore answer number.

620
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,980
What's your schedule like? Are
you wasting any time? Have you,

621
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,620
have you maxed them,

622
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,630
maximize the hours you can get out of a
day or are you spending time doing other

623
00:36:43,571 --> 00:36:45,730
things that you shouldn't be doing?
That being said,

624
00:36:45,731 --> 00:36:47,290
it sounds like you're
getting after it pretty hard,

625
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,910
which means you're probably pretty
efficient. And if you're, if you're

626
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,500
not wasting a bunch of time and you're
not doing a bunch of things that are non

627
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:03,400
productive and you're
feeling lonely and isolated,

628
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,400
then guess what? You're
going too far. You don't,

629
00:37:06,401 --> 00:37:11,170
you should not be feeling
lonely and isolated. That's
not good. You need to relax.

630
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,680
Especially because if you're training
that much, you're likely overtraining.

631
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,470
So broadly speaking, now, broadly
speaking, training should be enjoyable.

632
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,930
Okay? This doesn't mean that
you're gonna love it every day.

633
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:23,950
And I talked about that all the time.

634
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,200
It doesn't mean every day you
wake up and you're all, you know,

635
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:29,260
smile from one year to the other year
cause you're so happy you've got to go do,

636
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,640
you know, squats and dead lifts and like,
no, that doesn't happen. But broadly,

637
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:35,230
the way it makes you feel,

638
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,280
the way Jujitsu makes you feel it should
make the other times when you go on to

639
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:44,281
g two Matt and you get spanked and you
get ground out and you get tapped out and

640
00:37:46,211 --> 00:37:50,770
you feel like junk. Yes, that going
to happen. But again, broadly,

641
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,810
how does Jesus who make you feel?
It makes you feel good.

642
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,840
You should enjoy it to some extent,
right?

643
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,240
And you should not be getting burnt out.

644
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:02,020
And I think that's the most important
thing is that you shouldn't be getting

645
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:06,930
burnt out on Jujitsu, on working out. And,

646
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:11,680
and this is, this is important,
especially for your 17 years old,

647
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,050
there is more to life than
Jujitsu and physical fitness,

648
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,070
right? There's more to, there's more to,

649
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:24,220
there's more to doing.

650
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:28,300
Well in life than just
Jujitsu and physical fitness.

651
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,800
So a couple things.
If you can't,

652
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,670
if you can't communicate
with people effectively,

653
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,600
that's a real problem in any environment.
Right?

654
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,930
And if you're isolating yourself
from other people and you're not,

655
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,520
you're not learning how to interact
with other human beings in a social

656
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:52,110
environment, that's not good. And it's
not only, it's not only that, it's,

657
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,990
it's not only that,
it's just not good for you because yes,

658
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:58,360
you as a person that you need to be
well rounded. You need to be, yes,

659
00:38:58,361 --> 00:39:01,480
you need to be strong. You need to be
capable from a fighting perspective,

660
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,240
but you also need to be smart.
You need to be articulate.

661
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,290
You need to be quick witted

662
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,070
yeah.

663
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,970
And those things are mandatory
skills in life. I mean,

664
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,990
if you're a black belt in Jujitsu and
you're a white belt in the communicating

665
00:39:14,991 --> 00:39:17,810
with other human beings, that's not
going to be a good situation for you.

666
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:22,310
And the other thing is,
the better you are,

667
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,760
the more well rounded you are in all these
other aspects of life of those things

668
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:28,580
will actually make you better. At jujitsu
cause you'll be able to read people,

669
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,500
you'll be able to deal with confrontation,

670
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:33,860
you'll be able to understand other
people's motivations and all those things

671
00:39:33,861 --> 00:39:35,810
come from interacting
with other human beings.

672
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,790
So I get it,

673
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,590
I get the massive commitment
and that is what it takes.

674
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:48,220
Like if you want to compete at the
highest level, I'm telling you, yes,

675
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:52,090
you have to live, breathe and
eat Jujitsu. You have to live,

676
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:56,930
breathe and eat conditioning.
And that being said,

677
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,000
if that's all you live,
breathe and eat,

678
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:00,500
yeah,

679
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,500
that's gonna make you less apt to be
a champion then if you make yourself a

680
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:11,250
little bit more well rounded
in some of these other aspects.

681
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,180
So dude,
keep training hard.

682
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,800
17 year old blue belt from UK.
Keep training hard,

683
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,320
go out occasionally hang out with
some people, have a good time.

684
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,850
And that by no means means get
hammered every time you do it at all.

685
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,400
Not at all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That
social aspect, man, that's like, that's,

686
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,950
it seems like a lot of times,
especially when you're training,

687
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:42,560
are you doing something that's kind
of directly or can be viewed as like

688
00:40:42,561 --> 00:40:44,300
directly opposite of a social thing?

689
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:46,490
Can you know when you think socially
you're thinking all you guys are just

690
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:51,020
slacking, hang it out according to the
Bar, cruising at the beach, whatever.

691
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,830
Well, while we're over here training
kind of thing. Right? Just like,

692
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,520
just like people say, Oh, you're sleeping
on the couch. You know, what are you lazy?

693
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,370
Sleeping on the couch warm. I Dunno.
Maybe they need rest, you know?

694
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,170
Or there there's, there,
there is use in sleep.

695
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,850
Seems like that was a,
that was a little,

696
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,110
maybe kind of a glimpse into
the Echo Charles world right
there. Maybe. Maybe not.

697
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,750
It doesn't let you sleep on the couch.
Maybe I need rest.

698
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:17,060
Maybe I'm recovering from Norco state.
I'm saying.

699
00:41:17,061 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm saying there's two parts of it.

700
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:23,710
You know that there's that and
so in people give it a bad rap.

701
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,790
I think especially like you,
you know how like, you know,

702
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:30,791
you hear these motivational gurus
grind all sleep when I'm dead,

703
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:33,530
you know, that kind of thing,
right? Yeah, I say that. So

704
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:38,880
I you said it, not me, but
hey, all right, so the,

705
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,380
and I'm not saying that you know, that's
dumb or nothing like that. I'm saying,

706
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,950
I'm saying that it,

707
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,530
it produces a certain message that can
be interpreted in a way that might not be

708
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:52,620
the most beneficial. Well,
I'm sure I think this, this,

709
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:56,690
I'm glad that he asked this question
because he's taken the attitude of like,

710
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:59,130
okay, I'm going to sleep when
I'm dead and I'm going to,

711
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,760
I'm going to hang out with other human
beings after I'm a world champion. Right.

712
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,220
And again, do you need to be possessed
to be a world champion? Yes, you do.

713
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:12,610
But all I'm saying is part of the things
that will make you be a better well

714
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:17,360
rounded person, the more well rounded you
are, the better you're going to perform.

715
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,880
Yeah. You know, you're going to
learn how to deal with anxiety.

716
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,140
You're going to learn
how to deal with people.

717
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,430
You're going to learn how to
look at someone else's situation,

718
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:25,790
look in their eyes and be like,
okay, this guy's stressed out,

719
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,320
or this guy's panicking,
or this guy, you know,

720
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:29,360
you learn those things from
interacting with other people.

721
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,980
That's gonna make you a better competitor.

722
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,540
You're going to learn more about yourself.

723
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:35,810
That's going to make you a
better competitor. Yeah, and
you're going to be, if you,

724
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:39,050
if you relax now, what you don't want to
do is go so far in the other direction.

725
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:43,400
We show up to a competition and you don't
feel like you've prepared as much as

726
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:48,170
you could, but that, what does that
do? You go too far the other direction.

727
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:51,770
Now you overtrained. Yeah, so
you got to find a little bit of,

728
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,120
but sounds like you're a
little bit off balance,

729
00:42:53,121 --> 00:42:56,060
especially because you're feeling like
the words that kind of keyed me off the

730
00:42:56,061 --> 00:43:01,030
most in this was, what was it? Lonely
and isolated. That's what kind of key,

731
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,160
if you said everything else here and
then you are like, am I overtraining?

732
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,620
I would have said, no man, you're
getting after it a good job,

733
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,920
but then when you say, look,
I feel lonely and isolated.

734
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,440
You don't want to feel
lonely and isolated like,

735
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,530
and that's another thing when I changed
Jitsu, that's kind of where I hang out.

736
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,140
Like I don't interact with people.
Normally it's a social thing.

737
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,610
We might not even talk,

738
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,440
we might not even say one word other than
do you want a roll? And then we train.

739
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,170
That's sort of my social activity of,

740
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:33,410
of hanging around with other people and
I don't feel I leave the gym and I feel

741
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,810
like I hung out with a lot of people.
I didn't say anything to them,

742
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,750
but if you feel lonely and isolated,
that's not good. That's getting to you.

743
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:44,900
That means your mind is starting
to be worn down from this.

744
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,530
Don't let it get worn down.
It's going to refuel you to go out.

745
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,970
It's going to watch this. Watch this.
If you're feeling lonely and isolated,

746
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:56,090
your workout that day is like a nine.

747
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,580
If you feel like like, Hey, I'm having
a good life. I'm filled with energy.

748
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:02,331
I like hanging out.

749
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:06,470
I just had a good time with this girl
last night and now I'm going to train.

750
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:07,820
It's like, oh, okay, guess what?

751
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:12,140
That's workouts at 9.7 you get a better
training cause you had a good time. Yeah.

752
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,040
So yeah,
I don't like to,

753
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:18,650
I don't like the fact that he says he's
lonely and isolated. That's not good.

754
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,130
And again, this is just a dichotomy
because then you'll get someone that says,

755
00:44:25,131 --> 00:44:27,530
okay well chocolates would go out
and you don't have party, you know,

756
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:31,970
party and party with the ladies
and then and then yeah, it'll

757
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,820
help my workout. And then while, you know,

758
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,520
maybe if I only work out three times a
week and I spend most of my time partying,

759
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,570
I'll be just,
I'll get workouts level 11 no you won't.

760
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,510
So yeah,
man,

761
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,940
make some exceptions to your discipline
and go enjoy the company of some other

762
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:54,570
people. Grow a little bit as a person.
Become a better human, compete better,

763
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,190
train harder. That's it. Agree.

764
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:02,850
This is a concept that I think is if you
can kind of incorporate or understand

765
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:06,420
this concept in, you know, when
you're working hard at something.

766
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,590
So when I was young, when I first
started lifting weights first started,

767
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:15,460
I don't know 15 or what, however
we'll do. Um, so you know,

768
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:18,980
you know how when you lift weights and
you get that little pump right to me,

769
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,920
to me I thought that that's literally
my muscles growing. You know,

770
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,810
like I didn't know how it all worked.
I was like Dang my mom,

771
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,660
I can see the growth already.

772
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,980
So all they gotta do is lift every
single day and watch. I'll quit.

773
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,001
Cause most people,

774
00:45:33,001 --> 00:45:36,360
they won't work as hard as me because
I'll just w w because I liked doing it.

775
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:39,750
I like the pump, whatever.
Um, so I would do,

776
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,180
we remember the guy,

777
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,860
my friend I mentioned Eric Masters
pilot in the air force. Yes.

778
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,000
So he, he had the one, he always had
the soda above the microwave. Anyway,

779
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:55,560
so I lift with him. Him and his dad would
invite me and my brother over, we'll,

780
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,230
we'll lift and he started off with
bench and you know this stuff.

781
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:03,360
So we go lift and I'm like, damn,
I feel a pump. So now when I,

782
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,360
when we trend kind of went into,

783
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:09,330
I want to say like varsity football,
I don't know. Anyway, we were,

784
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,340
we started lifting in the
weight room at the high school.

785
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,310
So I would do the same thing every single
day, every single day, every single day.

786
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,950
And my friend was like, this
other guy I know. He goes,

787
00:46:16,951 --> 00:46:21,180
hey you are you benching every
single day? And I was like, yeah.

788
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,750
And he was like, Bro, your muscles
aren't going to grow. I was like,

789
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:26,850
what are you talking about? Of course
they do. They grow every single day.

790
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,820
Like I feel it even he's like, Bro,
you don't know how it works. He's like,

791
00:46:29,821 --> 00:46:32,430
you don't,
when you lift they don't grow.

792
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,750
They actually get torn and they get like
almost like a little micro injury that

793
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,800
that's how it works.

794
00:46:37,801 --> 00:46:41,760
And then when you rest and when you
sleep and when you eat and they grow.

795
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,780
And I was like, whoa. And he did. It still
didn't make sense. So I was like, okay,

796
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:48,810
I guess you know, he's like, you ever
heard, you know when the soreness,

797
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:51,060
you know when you get the soreness or
whatever. I was like, yeah. He was like,

798
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:52,410
that's like it,
like hurt,

799
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:55,080
like kind of injured or whatever and then
it has to heal up and when it heals up

800
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:58,560
it heals up bigger. And I'm
like, oh, okay. It's like so
you can't bend to everyday.

801
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:02,220
Otherwise it'll just like,
it'll just won't grow it
always be damaged. I was like,

802
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:05,610
oh, makes sense. So that
rest in between workouts,

803
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,830
it's kind of important given
Mike Oh Gross. So muscles,

804
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:14,190
and you'll see what I'm saying where this
kind of thing where it's like all go,

805
00:47:14,191 --> 00:47:18,210
all go, no arrest. Right. You
need that rest to grow literally.

806
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,060
And that goes for anything.
Truth,

807
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:26,160
and this is kind of the next question is
very closely related to this and that's

808
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:30,070
why I put it kind of like
right next to it. And

809
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,520
that is Jocko, I should have
asked it in muster zeros or six.

810
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,390
Is there a dichotomy,
dichotomy in the unmitigated,

811
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:41,800
unmitigated daily discipline in
all thing? Yeah, and like I said,

812
00:47:41,801 --> 00:47:44,950
this is why I put this question here
because it's related to the question they

813
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:49,150
answer that I just gave, which is
yes, you can, you can overdo it.

814
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,170
And there is a dichotomy.
You can put so much focus on working.

815
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,880
Um,
you can put so much working,

816
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,050
so much focused on working that you
lose track of your family and everything

817
00:48:02,051 --> 00:48:04,180
goes down until with your family.
Or you can do the opposite.

818
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:09,070
Put so much focus on your family that
you lose track of that you don't do what

819
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:12,680
you're supposed to do at work. Um,
so you need to back off a little. Uh,

820
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:17,350
and you get people that waste
time on things that don't matter.

821
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,930
This goes back to remember the podcast
we did where I was talking about how like

822
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:24,550
a black belt when a white belts grabbing,

823
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,280
grabbing a black belt sleeve
and it just doesn't matter.

824
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,930
There's people that think
that it's important that I
do this thing for a certain

825
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:36,730
way, and the reality is it's useless.
It doesn't matter. You're being OCD,

826
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:41,530
right? You're being OCD. So, or
you maybe not being full as you,

827
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:42,400
but you're being borderline.

828
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,590
You got to think about what's
important and what's not important.

829
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:46,020
And if you're discipline,

830
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:51,030
if you generally or oftentimes people
that are hyper disciplined about little

831
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:54,874
things,

832
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:59,110
a lot of times they're missing their
discipline in other areas of their life.

833
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:02,440
And one of them, and, and we've
talked about this before too,

834
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:06,220
which is somebody that just because
someone has hyper disciplined in their

835
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:09,430
physical fitness doesn't mean that
they're disciplined in their rest of their

836
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:13,690
life in many other ways,
whether it's financial, whether
it's their relationships,

837
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:15,880
whatever, like everything that
they can be screwing every,

838
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
they're super disciplined in weighing
their food and doing macro calorie

839
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:23,750
counting and all that stuff,
right?

840
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:29,130
And yet they haven't paid their phone
bill or whatever and they've got financial

841
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:33,190
issues or they've got
health other health issues.

842
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:36,980
And so you need to,

843
00:49:36,981 --> 00:49:41,950
you need to back off enough on the little
things that don't matter that so that

844
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,020
the things that matter you can
actually take care of. Now,

845
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:47,230
the weird dichotomy in this is again,
it's always comes up,

846
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:51,040
the Russian soldiers in the Chechen war,
not shaving.

847
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,360
Is it really important that they shave?
Not really,

848
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,750
but what's really important is that they
have discipline overall and when they

849
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:05,020
stopped shaving faced, they let go of
their discipline and that was the problem.

850
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:09,460
Now, so there, there is
about, that's what I'm saying,

851
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:11,230
there's a balance and it gets a little,
let me,

852
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:12,550
let me make that a little more clearly.

853
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:17,970
If we were in a war and what
I was focused on was equity,

854
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,540
better shave tomorrow,

855
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,910
that was my big focus and
echo your uniform better be
squared away tomorrow like

856
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:28,370
that. That is not what the most important,
most important thing is like echo.

857
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,700
Do you understand where the
fallback positions are? Echo,

858
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:33,450
do you understand what your
field of fire is? Echo,

859
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,570
do you know what you're supposed to
do when we start getting overrun?

860
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,410
Those are what's important.
And,

861
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,240
but if I focus on this little
thing that doesn't really matter,

862
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,120
that can,
that can be a problem.

863
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,590
So I need to make sure that I'm focused
on the correct things and in life. Yes,

864
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:48,920
you can.

865
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,280
Unmitigated daily discipline if you try
to apply it to absolutely everything in

866
00:50:52,281 --> 00:50:54,590
your life,
just like prioritize and execute.

867
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:56,180
If you try and solve all your
problems at the same time,

868
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,050
you won't be able to solve any.

869
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,210
If you try and implement
perfect discipline in every
single thing that you do,

870
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:07,360
you won't be able to apply discipline
to the things that are most important.

871
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,960
My garage gym floor is dirty.

872
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:18,390
Okay. I sweep it. Sure, of course.

873
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,560
I sweep it every third day.
I just sweep it out.

874
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,150
But I don't get in there with a bucket
and a mop and try and clean the chalk off

875
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:30,920
so it's perfect black. Why?
Cause it doesn't matter.

876
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,720
Yeah. So some things in life are
like your gym floor. It just,

877
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:37,100
it doesn't matter if there's chalk on it.

878
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:40,280
I'm going to put more chalk on it later.
The chalk doesn't make me slip.

879
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,210
It doesn't make me sick. It doesn't. It
doesn't, but I don't care how it looks.

880
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,480
So don't worry about the chalk
on the gym floor. In fact,

881
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:50,510
there's gyms in the world where you're
not allowed to have chalk cause they

882
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:54,710
don't want chalk on the gym floor.
Those places shouldn't exist in the world.

883
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,110
They should be. They should be illegal.
There should be chalk everywhere.

884
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,190
The gym available. Yeah, you're right. So
don't focus on things that don't matter.

885
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:05,380
There you go. Yeah man. It's,

886
00:52:05,381 --> 00:52:09,410
see it seems like the whole discipline
equals freedom thing and whether you

887
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:11,900
agree with it or not actually you
know I think you will agree with this.

888
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,800
It's a dance, you know it's the
dance with discipline and freedom.

889
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,560
Do you mean about a balance
of a dichotomy? Yes it is.

890
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:20,660
In fact I wrote a book about it.
Thank you.

891
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,660
I appreciate you pointing that out to
me and it's going to be asked to take

892
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:27,620
ownership too. It just depends
on who you are. Like you,

893
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:31,430
you're the discipline is going to be
taking the lead big time, you know.

894
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:35,750
And when you exercise your
freedom with, I dunno, I dunno.

895
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:39,410
Diet wise is like what mint chocolate
chip ice cream or something like this.

896
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,450
When you exercise that freedom,
it's not going to be very often,

897
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,880
but when you do boom,
it's going to have benefits.

898
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:46,880
And that's when you see somebody that's,
let's just talk about this.

899
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,450
Well when you see somebody that's
out of shape, you could say,

900
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:53,410
you can say one of two things. You
could say not enough discipline, right?

901
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:57,470
Or You could say too much freedom.
We know it's one of those two things.

902
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,980
If you see someone that's having
financial issues, it's one or two things,

903
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,320
not enough discipline or too much freedom.

904
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:06,750
They're getting out that credit card
when they shouldn't be. Right. So yeah,

905
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:11,000
it goes without saying that it's a
balance. It's dichotomy. That's correct.

906
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:16,220
So even, and also on top of that,
the discipline in all things,

907
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:18,050
cause that's the question,
right? You could put,

908
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,740
maybe you could write a book called
the dance, the dance of leadership.

909
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,060
I'll just copy the leading.

910
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,300
We'll be all good. But the, in all
things like discipline in diet,

911
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:34,980
discipline in, um, uh, you know,
workouts and not slacking and whatever.

912
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:39,570
And that looks way different
than discipline in like
relationships for example.

913
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:41,890
Like if you're like a diff like to to,
you know,

914
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:45,180
the discipline not to lose your
temper or the discipline to,

915
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:49,050
to respond to a maybe not
disciplined person or something.

916
00:53:49,051 --> 00:53:50,400
Let's say someone you love who's,

917
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:54,060
who's maybe emotionally different than
you or whatever that looks and feels way

918
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:58,410
different. You know, if, if you really
think about it, so if you're like, Hey,

919
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,410
I'm not gonna,
I dunno,

920
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,810
I'm not going to go to the park with
my wife because I'm working out.

921
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,160
That's my discipline.
I'm no slack, you know,

922
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:12,930
kind of base or you're lacking the
discipline to organize around your

923
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:15,540
relationship with your
relationship or whatever.

924
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,600
You're lacking the discipline to make
sure that your wife understands that

925
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:23,580
you're going to train. Yes, cause I don't
want to train. But as far as we're like,

926
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:27,330
and now that's back on the training again.
But like with like your relationships,

927
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,660
unless your relationships are important
to you, which is, I mean I would,

928
00:54:30,661 --> 00:54:35,661
I would argue most times there's
some relationships in your life that,

929
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,220
that are going to be important.
I would argue that there should be,

930
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,280
I think so too.
Yes.

931
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:46,670
So maintaining discipline in those
relationships looks different.

932
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:50,310
So it might not be as obvious.
So when someone says Ma Unlimited,

933
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:53,250
when you say unmeeted gated
discipline and all things,

934
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:57,050
I don't think automatically right off
the top of my head. Like, Oh, you know,

935
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,900
my relationship with my wife, you know,
or even the relationship with your kids.

936
00:55:00,901 --> 00:55:04,170
Like when I think unmitigated
daily discipline in all
things, including my kids.

937
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,100
So I'm gonna,

938
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:08,310
I'm gonna make sure they're disciplined
all but the discipline of you,

939
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:12,090
of yourself dealing with the kids,
that's a whole different thing.

940
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,910
See what I'm saying? True. So you've
got to kind of keep those in my, Oh,

941
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:19,050
I've found, yeah, I find that
when I want to keep that in mind,

942
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:22,110
it'll help and then, yeah, and
do the dance. With freedom,

943
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:27,111
you designate how much freedom you are
going to exercise and then you do the

944
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:31,570
dense, assume sane, you balance
the dichotomies. What she'd do bro,

945
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,850
you dance. It's like, and here's the,

946
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,700
here's the wrong thing.

947
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:43,320
What I made a mistake of w at one point
long time ago I looked at you and I was

948
00:55:43,321 --> 00:55:47,040
like, shoot, I need to do
that. I need to wake up,

949
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:51,210
I need to like do all this stuff with
it. But if, if I were to do that,

950
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:52,230
I jumped myself up

951
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:57,840
so I can't like you can't use like the
next person as the standards as far as

952
00:55:57,841 --> 00:56:01,980
the balance goes. Like you have to
designate your own balance. Yeah.

953
00:56:01,981 --> 00:56:05,850
Cause you have to modulate
for your life. Yeah. Whatever.

954
00:56:05,851 --> 00:56:09,210
Brown people don't just automatically
know that. I know I didn't check,

955
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,760
figured it out. I didn't see you getting
up at four 30 if at any point though.

956
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:16,770
Yeah, I tried to check. Anyway.

957
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,443
Next question.

958
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:24,260
Is there one form or type of Jujitsu
that is better than other forms?

959
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,090
Not Japanese versus small circle Jujitsu,

960
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,470
but pressure versus movement.
Bottom versus top.

961
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,790
Different types of quote unquote
games. Got It. Yeah. So there's,

962
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:39,760
if you don't know this, there's
different types of Jujitsu in the world.

963
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,740
There's things like he mentioned here,

964
00:56:41,741 --> 00:56:45,250
there's Japanese Jujitsu
and there's something called
small circles she's doing.

965
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:50,260
Then there's just a million different
kinds of random sort of names that people

966
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:53,110
will put on Jujitsu.
Right.

967
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:58,650
The one that we do is generally
referred to as Brazilian Jujitsu.

968
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:04,290
I just generally for trued as Jitsu
because that's what I'm talking about. Uh,

969
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:09,070
so there are different types of
all the different types of Jujitsu.

970
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,730
The one that you should be doing is
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. The other types

971
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,790
are not what you want to be doing.

972
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:21,320
Jenn Rubin generally and the,
yeah, so that's just the,

973
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:25,660
that's just the reality of it. So now,
but then he's asking a different question,

974
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,850
which is deep inside of inside
of even Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

975
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:35,250
there's different types of styles that
people will have and these are people end

976
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:41,140
up calling them games like what
kind of game does this person have?

977
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,240
What kind of game does that person have?

978
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:47,530
And different people have different
games and it depends on their body.

979
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:51,550
The different body types have different
styles, different games, different,

980
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,420
even different, like cardio levels can
have different games, different thoughts,

981
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:59,110
different flexibility levels,
different games, different styles,

982
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:04,600
even different personalities.
If you have different personalities,

983
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:06,640
you'll end up with a different style.

984
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,640
So the question is,

985
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:14,730
are there some games or some styles that
are better than other games or other

986
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,650
styles inside of Jujitsu?

987
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:21,640
And my answer to that I think is no,

988
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,120
there's not games that are
better than other games.

989
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:29,410
Not Styles of Jujitsu that are
better than other styles of Jujitsu.

990
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,090
It's just different.

991
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:36,091
People gravitate towards different
ones and they use them successfully and

992
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:39,250
that's why they continue to use them.
I would say this though,

993
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:45,300
if you can then develop
more than one game,

994
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,220
right?
More than one game.

995
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,180
Like if all you know how
to do is pressure pass,

996
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,760
that's the only kind of pass you know
and you come up against someone that's

997
00:58:54,761 --> 00:58:57,220
really good at good at
defending the pressure pass,

998
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,390
you won't be able to pass the guard.
If you're,

999
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,380
if you have a really good top game but
you go against a wrestler that's a better

1000
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:08,770
restaurant you and put you on your back,
then that's going to be a problem.

1001
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,480
So d you're going to vote. And the other
thing people ask is how do I develop?

1002
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:16,400
My style, the answers you just train
and your style is going to call you.

1003
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,850
You don't know. Occasionally
someone might tell you like, hey,

1004
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:22,040
you're long and Lanky, you
should use Triangley should
set up good triangle games

1005
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,700
are good Darce chokes or
someone says, Hey, you're,
you got good base, you should,

1006
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,020
you know, abuse, a lot of pressure.

1007
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:29,480
So there can be someone
giving you some indication,

1008
00:59:29,481 --> 00:59:33,320
but you're going to self
select as you train what works.

1009
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,570
And as you can continue
to do what works for you,

1010
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:40,220
you'll get better and better at it. Yeah,
that's funny you said it makes sense,

1011
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:44,180
like just train and it'll sort of
sort itself out. You know, your game,

1012
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:49,070
your style in the, the reason,
um, this might seem kind of,

1013
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:50,840
but the reason why I like these tall,
lanky guys,

1014
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:53,600
they'll do like triangles and stuff
because when they first start training

1015
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,470
though,

1016
00:59:54,470 --> 00:59:58,760
the triangle is going to come weight
easier than a guy who's not as Lanky,

1017
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,340
you know, early on. So they'd be
like, oh shoot, that's successful.

1018
01:00:01,341 --> 01:00:04,310
So it's Kinda like check that.
That's good. So there again, boom,

1019
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:06,200
that becomes part of
their game super early.

1020
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:11,210
So that kind of is a dominant part of
their whole game. And then the, you know,

1021
01:00:11,211 --> 01:00:13,430
the more,
the more they train,

1022
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:16,970
the more things are going to start falling
into place in their game. You know?

1023
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,160
And so if you have a lengthy prayers,
all those lanky moves,

1024
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:21,320
they're gonna Register
way quicker than you know,

1025
01:00:21,321 --> 01:00:23,750
a shorter guy or stock your guy that's,
yeah.

1026
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:26,960
It's funny how you put that just train,
they'll sort of just,

1027
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,960
they reveal themselves.
Oh yeah, they totally do

1028
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:34,700
this. This question also
ties into the next question.

1029
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:38,960
So I kind of coupled it up with the next
question as well. Did you, do you feel,

1030
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,920
well, you know your answer to that.
Is there a better game or whatever?

1031
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,190
I feel like you don't like when you watch
ADCC or something like this and then

1032
01:00:46,191 --> 01:00:48,560
you'd have a guy like
[inaudible] who's six,

1033
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,630
four and then you have Marcella Garcia
guys who are arguably like just as good,

1034
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:58,870
the two best guys ever to do it. And
they're just completely opposite. Yeah,

1035
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,140
man. It's Kinda like when I
watch those kind of like, um,

1036
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,510
like you ever heard of the game mortal
Kombat? I have heard of it. Yeah.

1037
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,760
So it's like this is this
real violent game as 2000,

1038
01:01:07,761 --> 01:01:10,640
because it's like they have weapons
and stuff that they can sort of bus out

1039
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,160
random places, games,
Scorpion, his weapon,

1040
01:01:13,161 --> 01:01:16,910
it's a sphere with a rope or chain or
whatever and he pulls you and he does his

1041
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:20,920
thing. Then the guy who can freeze
people, you know, and the guy who can, um,

1042
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:23,720
I don't know, throw his hat and
just cut people. I don't, you know,

1043
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:26,300
so people have all these different
weapons, but then you would think, hey,

1044
01:01:26,301 --> 01:01:29,630
if a guy can freeze, a person
wouldn't, he'd be the best guy.

1045
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:32,700
You just free if people, so
you've got to do, you know,

1046
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,010
but it doesn't work itself out.

1047
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:36,530
It's whoever is good at using
the little ice ray or whatever,

1048
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:40,960
whatever it's called, who's better at
using that spear with the, with the rope.

1049
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,370
Okay. We'll go with it, man.
But that's, that's the way
it works is you just did to,

1050
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:49,730
I'm just saying. Well anyways,
that question relates to
the next question. Oh, okay.

1051
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,380
Yes. Next question. Sure.
Yes. Hi Jack. Mortal Kombat

1052
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,940
and street fighter two yes.
Actually there street fighter,

1053
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,750
which really kind of went unnoticed
I think by the general public.

1054
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:06,440
Then there's street fighter two. That's
when it sort of became like this big,

1055
01:02:06,441 --> 01:02:11,441
that was like the main combat game I
think with fighting street fighter two.

1056
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:16,430
What years was that? I Dunno. I was in
high school who also nineties it was good.

1057
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,550
I was doing Jujitsu worries. Yeah, man.

1058
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:23,050
Well you missed out a little bit because
canola is a lot of salt on anything

1059
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:27,000
street fighter two with,
there was this guy named Guile guile.

1060
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:30,870
Bro. I'm telling you. I'm
telling you, revisit that.

1061
01:02:30,871 --> 01:02:35,060
Or in your case visit that Guile, he threw
this thing called a sonic. It's, it's,

1062
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,220
it's a lot and just look at it.
Anyway, next question Jocko.

1063
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:43,430
There's an army cliche that I'm sure
you've heard of or you've heard.

1064
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:46,170
That goes,
everyone's leadership style is different.

1065
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,970
I've heard it used many times as a
coverup for failed mission or with someone

1066
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:52,320
who just isn't getting it done.

1067
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,230
What's your opinion on this for
all the advice that you give?

1068
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:59,190
There seems to be a continuous method to
your madness and some basic principles

1069
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:00,240
for being a good leader.

1070
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:05,550
Does everyone have a different leadership
style or is there an optimal optimal

1071
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:08,580
method with personality tweaks?

1072
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:13,850
That's just amazing how well this
Jujitsu comparison to this is, this is,

1073
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:16,560
this is just an incredible translation.

1074
01:03:16,561 --> 01:03:19,610
And if you know the way broad
broadly you seen in all things,

1075
01:03:19,611 --> 01:03:23,690
because what this question is,
is exactly the same as the question above.

1076
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,390
And the fact of the matter is,

1077
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,600
if you know Jiu Jitsu Brazilian Jujitsu,
yeah.

1078
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:36,860
You know the fundamental principles of it,
you can do these tweaks.

1079
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,570
If you don't know the
fundamental principles of it,

1080
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,150
you're just going to get destroyed now.
Okay.

1081
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:46,220
If you're a catch wrestler that those
have the same sort of fundamental things

1082
01:03:46,221 --> 01:03:49,490
going on. You know what I mean? If
you know Samba, so if you know judo,

1083
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,040
so I'm saying if you understand,
I don't know what to call them.

1084
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:55,490
But if you understand like the fundamental
principles of submission grappling of

1085
01:03:55,491 --> 01:03:58,100
any kind,
if you know what those are,

1086
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:01,280
then you can make some tweaks to them.

1087
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,140
You can make some adjustments to them to
bait based on your style and your body

1088
01:04:06,141 --> 01:04:09,920
type and your personality and your
strengths and weaknesses. Yes,

1089
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,650
it is the same thing with leadership.

1090
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,780
So people are going to
have different styles.

1091
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,510
They're going to have
different styles of leadership.

1092
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:22,880
Some people are super
caring, charismatic, right?

1093
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:25,190
And that person could take
advantage of their, their charisma.

1094
01:04:25,370 --> 01:04:29,630
Some people like connect with other
people really easily. Some people don't.

1095
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:35,590
You're going to have just different little
nuances to your personality and your

1096
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:38,420
brain that are going to,

1097
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,660
that you're going to make little
adaptations and your leadership style.

1098
01:04:41,690 --> 01:04:42,530
That's okay.

1099
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:48,490
Where it gets not okay is if you
leave the fundamental principles,

1100
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:52,660
that's where you have a problem with
it. Because there was a, there's uh,

1101
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:54,620
an example that I thought of
when I read this question.

1102
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:58,870
There was a guy that was coming through
my training when I was running the, uh,

1103
01:04:59,090 --> 01:05:04,090
the advanced training for the seals and
he was making an actually leafs told

1104
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:07,970
story. You remember left. He's told the
story. I think it's in the book too.

1105
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:11,660
I don't remember. But it's, it's podcast
book. We've talked about it in a bunch.

1106
01:05:11,661 --> 01:05:13,550
We talk about it when we
took go talk to clients,

1107
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:18,910
life tells this story about how he was
trying to give commands over the radio

1108
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:24,210
and no one's doing anything because it's
ineffective to give commands in a radio

1109
01:05:24,731 --> 01:05:27,070
in a when there's a lot of machine
gun fire and all this stuff going on.

1110
01:05:27,071 --> 01:05:29,350
So I said,
hey leaf use verbal commands.

1111
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:32,110
And He kinda like looked at me like I
was crazy and I said to him and just give

1112
01:05:32,111 --> 01:05:33,850
it a try. He did it. It worked.

1113
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:37,660
A couple of years later I'm running
training and there's a guy that's given a

1114
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:41,410
bunch of commands on the radio
and I go to him, I go, hey man,

1115
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:45,850
use verbal commands. And he's like, he's
like, what do you mean? And I'm like,

1116
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:49,060
yell at everyone. So they know
what it is you want them to do.

1117
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:54,370
They can't hear you on the radio. There's
a lot of stuff going on. And he goes,

1118
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:58,780
I don't lead that way.
That's what he said to me.

1119
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:03,580
I don't lead that way.
And you know,

1120
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:07,510
they just got destroyed because, you know,
in his, I don't know if he thought like,

1121
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:10,240
hey look, I'm not going to yet. I
wasn't telling him to yell at US people,

1122
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,840
I was telling them like yelled the
verbal commands and he wouldn't do it.

1123
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:18,040
And they just got
annihilated all the time.

1124
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,760
And he ended up not doing well as a
leader because he was breaking the

1125
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:29,740
fundamental principles of combat
leadership, like simple, clear,

1126
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:31,900
concise commands that everyone understands
it. If they don't understand it,

1127
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:33,160
whose fault it's yours.

1128
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,890
And if you're talking on the
radio giving these complex orders,

1129
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,670
people aren't gonna understand what
to do. But if you give them the, the,

1130
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:42,730
the standard operating procedure,
maneuver, command peel, right,

1131
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,310
that's going to get passed
and everyone's gonna do it.

1132
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:51,130
So he strayed away from the
fundamental principles. It's like,

1133
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:54,430
it's like saying, well you
know with me, if I give you,

1134
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:58,810
if I use a pressure point on your
neck, then I'll win. It's like, no,

1135
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:00,250
actually that's not going to be effective.

1136
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:04,990
You the pressure point thing
is a fantasy. Oh No, it's real.

1137
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:07,490
Oh okay. It is real. You
know what? And there's a,

1138
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:11,260
there's certain parts of your body that
hurt a little bit more when you press

1139
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:11,830
into them.

1140
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:16,780
I understand that that doesn't change you
from getting choked doesn't change you

1141
01:07:16,781 --> 01:07:18,130
from getting double leg takedown.

1142
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,950
You'd try and hit some of the pressure
point while they're doing a double leg

1143
01:07:20,951 --> 01:07:25,060
take down on you. You're not gonna
make it. No, it's not going to happen.

1144
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:30,340
So, um, you, you, you have,

1145
01:07:30,341 --> 01:07:34,600
and I've told this story too about the
guy that wasn't very loud and I told him

1146
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:35,500
like, Hey, you got to get louder.

1147
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:38,620
And eventually he got the guys that were
allowed in his platoon to start giving

1148
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,660
the verbal commands cause he
wasn't loud enough to do it.

1149
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:43,720
And that was an effective way.
Still using the same principle,

1150
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:46,990
just using a little bit of a different
technique. That's fine. So yes,

1151
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,370
different leaders are
going to lead differently,

1152
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:52,090
but the principles are going to remain
the same that the principles of ownership

1153
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:53,200
cover moves,
simple,

1154
01:07:53,201 --> 01:07:57,010
prioritize and execute decentralized
command and balancing the dichotomies.

1155
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:02,080
And then there's plenty of them in
leadership. The good leaders out there,

1156
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,800
they will follow those principles and
they'll make little tweaks to them based

1157
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:09,670
on their personality.
And that's fine.

1158
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,200
But a tweak doesn't require an excuse
and also effective or ineffective.

1159
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,780
Like if you make a change,

1160
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:20,120
if you do something a certain
way and it's not effective,

1161
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,360
then whatever you change, this
isn't working, it's not working.

1162
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:28,880
So use the fundamental principles, make
little APP to adaptations. It's okay,

1163
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,810
but if a leader is ineffective
and they're failing, guess what?

1164
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:35,570
Their little adaptations. So like,
Hey, I could make up a new move,

1165
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:40,150
right for Jujitsu and I,
and I call it the, the,

1166
01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:43,580
the Wizbang sure. And I say,
Hey, I made up the school move.

1167
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,520
It's called the Wizbang
and let me show it to you.

1168
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,650
And so I show it to and you're like,
well, I don't know if that'll work or not.

1169
01:08:48,651 --> 01:08:49,970
And I like, no, it'll definitely work.

1170
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,680
The cool thing about Jujitsu is when I try
it, we find out if it works. Right now,

1171
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,780
something doesn't work immediately,
right?

1172
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:00,080
But let's say I keep drilling it on you
and Julian on you and I can never get

1173
01:09:00,081 --> 01:09:02,300
you in the Wiz Bank.
Okay?

1174
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,290
And then I go on a tournament and I
tried the Wizbang and I get smashed and

1175
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,050
defeated, and then I, I go
through the constellation bracket,

1176
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:11,180
I try the Whiz Bang and it
gets smashed and defeated.

1177
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,790
Then I go to the next tournament.
I try the wizbang going to get smashed in,

1178
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:16,760
defeated.
Then I get in the constellation bracket.

1179
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:18,800
I try the Wizbang and
get smashed in defeated,

1180
01:09:18,950 --> 01:09:23,950
and I do this for six months and the
whizzbang never works effective or

1181
01:09:24,141 --> 01:09:29,000
ineffective currently in effect,
it's ineffective, it's ineffective.

1182
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,960
If you're in a leadership position or
someone's in a leadership position and

1183
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:36,860
they're failing and they're failing to
execute the mission over and over and

1184
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:38,990
over again,
they're little tweak that,

1185
01:09:38,991 --> 01:09:42,020
a little leadership thing that
they think is good to go. It's not,

1186
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:46,160
it's not good to go. And it
probably, in fact, I'll tell you,

1187
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,820
it violates one of the fundamental
principles of combat leadership.

1188
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,960
And if you can identify which one
of those things it's violating,

1189
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:57,260
you can get them to
clean it up and fix it.

1190
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:03,770
So there you go. Whizz Bang. Don't
try it. Don't try the Whiz Bang.

1191
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,650
I don't know though. I
mean these, the moves,

1192
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:10,520
you know how like guys will like
out moves, man. I Dunno. It's,

1193
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:14,120
it's this endless thing.
New moves come out. Yeah.

1194
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:18,560
And you won't hit a move 100% of the
time and you definitely won't hit it when

1195
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,240
you first started doing it.
It's going to be hard.

1196
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:23,870
How many arm locks do you think you put
on someone before you made someone tap?

1197
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,610
In the beginning you probably did 50
arm locks before you got someone to tap.

1198
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:32,270
Yeah, probably more. Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe even more so.

1199
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:34,910
That doesn't mean what the after
the first 49 outs and effective,

1200
01:10:34,911 --> 01:10:37,760
I'm not going to do it.
The big differences,

1201
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:41,720
the big differences on arm
lock is a proven known entity.

1202
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:45,050
Cover and move is a proven known entity.

1203
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:47,900
Simple is a proven known entity.

1204
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,290
Prioritize and execute
is a proven known entity.

1205
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:55,730
Extreme ownership is a proven, known
and decentralized command is a proven.

1206
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:59,450
It's like an all markets I could choke.
That's why when some people say to me, Oh,

1207
01:10:59,451 --> 01:11:02,390
well my boss doesn't
like extreme ownership,

1208
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:07,400
you know, I, I know what's happening.
Like it's, they're the bosses.

1209
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,710
Ego is offended because
there's some other,

1210
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:12,650
some somebody telling them a
different way to lead. No. It's like,

1211
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,560
what do you believe in? I don't believe
in extreme ownership. Oh, I blame him.

1212
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:20,190
I believe in placing the blame on
other people. That's how I lead.

1213
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:24,180
That's complete. Completely ridiculous.
Everybody knows that's ridiculous.

1214
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:28,920
It's completely ridiculous. Cover move.
I don't believe in cover move. Oh,

1215
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:32,460
so you just like your other team members
to go and take care of themselves and

1216
01:11:32,461 --> 01:11:37,350
you take care of yourself. How does that
work? It doesn't work. Keep the, Oh,

1217
01:11:37,351 --> 01:11:40,110
I don't like to keep things simple. No,
I like to make things so complicated.

1218
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,090
Complicated that people don't
understand what I'm talking about.

1219
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:47,070
Does that make any sense whatsoever?
No, it doesn't prioritize and execute.

1220
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,170
No, don't do that. What I,

1221
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:52,920
what I'm going to do is spread myself
so thin that I don't have the assets or

1222
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:55,980
resources to actually accomplish anything.
That's what I'm going to do.

1223
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:56,731
Cause that makes sense.

1224
01:11:56,731 --> 01:11:59,190
Cause I don't believe in extreme
ownership or those are fundamental laws of

1225
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:03,570
combat leadership. That's where
you're at decentralized command. Oh,

1226
01:12:03,571 --> 01:12:05,040
I don't believe in that.

1227
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:08,790
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
make every single decision myself from

1228
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:09,870
the headquarters position.

1229
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,600
When you guys want to make a decision out
there on the battlefield are out there

1230
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,850
and the on the manufacturing floor,

1231
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:18,300
I want you to run every single definitive
decision up through me cause that's

1232
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:23,160
going to be effective.
So if you violate one of these principles,

1233
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:27,330
you're, you're going to have problems as
a leader. If you tweak these principles,

1234
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:30,660
that's fine. If you look at decentralized
command and you're like, you know what?

1235
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:35,940
I know that the normal kind of
span of control is five people.

1236
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:40,290
I can handle more than that. I can
handle nine and you step it up. That's,

1237
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:44,790
that's tweak. That's okay.
Right? That's fine. If you pray,

1238
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,300
when you prioritize and execute, hey,
the way I prioritize and execute,

1239
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:51,420
and this is the truth,
the way I prioritize and execute isn't,

1240
01:12:51,421 --> 01:12:54,540
I look at my number one problem
and I only focused on that one.

1241
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:59,700
I assign somebody to my number
one problem and I say, hey bill,

1242
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:04,230
go handle that room over there. It's a
problem. And then I look at Mike and say,

1243
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,260
Hey Mike,
get the rest of this hallway cleared.

1244
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:11,190
So I'm actually handling two things,
but I give bill the priority.

1245
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,060
So that's a tweak. I'm
using assets. That's fine.

1246
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:19,980
So sometimes yes,
you got to make these little adjustments.

1247
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,800
Everyone's got a different
leadership style,

1248
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,220
but you don't violate the
principles of leadership.

1249
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:32,600
Just like you don't violate the
principles of submission grappling,

1250
01:13:34,201 --> 01:13:35,080
I'll call it.
Yeah.

1251
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:38,713
Next question.

1252
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,790
I'm a huge fan of the podcast
and I'd like your advice.

1253
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,070
When I was younger,

1254
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:50,780
I joined the National Guard in an attempt
to do something with my life and get

1255
01:13:50,781 --> 01:13:52,010
out of depression.

1256
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:57,560
I lost my discipline and goals after
basic training and continued in depression

1257
01:13:57,860 --> 01:13:59,270
and disorganization.

1258
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,350
I had the opportunity to go
to fight to flight school,

1259
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:08,440
but instead tested positive on a drug
test and I was given a general discharge.

1260
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:12,010
I of course, take full
responsibility, feel like an

1261
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,950
idiot. How would you recommend
moving past this failure?

1262
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:19,750
What would you have done if your
seal career ended with a mistake?

1263
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:26,140
Wolf,
my seal career had ended with a mistake.

1264
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:31,141
I would have figured out what
my next mission was going to be.

1265
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:36,160
That's that's what I would've done.
I mean, I would have said, okay,

1266
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,080
I liked that job.
I failed at it.

1267
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:43,920
What can I learn from that and what can
I do next differently to make sure I

1268
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:47,560
don't make that mistake again?
I'm going to learn from the past,

1269
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:50,800
but I'm not going to dwell on it.
There's no point in dwelling on it.

1270
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:53,970
The only point in dwelling on
it just to learn from it. So,

1271
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:54,970
so that's what I would do here.

1272
01:14:55,390 --> 01:15:00,390
And then I would take what I learned
from my experiences of where I failed.

1273
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:05,560
And I would also take the positive things
that I learned because you even that

1274
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,210
even that failure is a positive.

1275
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,940
Even that failure as a
positive because you realize,

1276
01:15:10,330 --> 01:15:14,050
you realize the value of the opportunity
that you had and you blew it and you're

1277
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:16,090
like, okay, I'm never gonna let
that happen again. A lesson learned,

1278
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:19,900
I'm actually stoked I get to learn that
lesson because it's going to be more

1279
01:15:19,901 --> 01:15:23,140
opportunities that come up in life and
you've got to make sure that you don't

1280
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:27,190
disregard those opportunities
when they come up.

1281
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:30,730
And so I would have taken those
lessons learned, take that,

1282
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,390
take that failure and turn it into
something positive and made good things

1283
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:36,640
happen when I figured
out what my new mission,

1284
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:41,260
a new career was going to be
pretty straight forward. You can,

1285
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:44,710
you can do so much good.
And you know,

1286
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:48,340
that's going back to the story that I
told about Jeff in the beginning of this

1287
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:51,730
podcast.
One of the wording,

1288
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,760
some of the wording that I
struggled with in the kid story,

1289
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,690
and again it's on,
it's the word kid podcast.

1290
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:03,670
One of the things that I struggled with
in telling the story was I ended up

1291
01:16:03,671 --> 01:16:08,440
saying Jeff had gone too far
and he couldn't correct himself.

1292
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:09,610
Yeah,

1293
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:14,610
he had gone too far and he couldn't come
back and that's a real hard thing to

1294
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:21,091
tell a person and it's a real hard thing
to tell a kid and they're the reason

1295
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:26,890
why I left it that way. The
reason why I kept it like, listen,

1296
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:32,400
you can make mistakes that you can't
come back from specially as a kid you can

1297
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:37,810
make mistakes that you can't come
back from there. Pretty rare, right?

1298
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:41,170
There's not too many mistakes that are
so grievous that you can't recover from

1299
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:44,980
them. Like this guy, hey
man, he made a mistake,

1300
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:49,240
failed a drug test given a general
discharge. That sucks. Guess what?

1301
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:53,230
He can do all kinds of good in the world.
He can make up for that 10 fold.

1302
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,890
He can start a business, make
money, he can create a family,

1303
01:16:56,891 --> 01:17:00,550
he can raise great kids and there's so
many things that he can make sure his

1304
01:17:00,551 --> 01:17:03,580
kids understand that and
know that and learn from it.

1305
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:07,270
And he can make sure some
other neighborhood kids and
high school kids and grade

1306
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:10,730
school kids, he can make such an impact
the world by learning from that mistake.

1307
01:17:11,150 --> 01:17:14,810
So it's very, it's a harsh
thing to say like, hey,

1308
01:17:15,350 --> 01:17:19,700
there's some things you can't now what
this guy can't recover from and this is

1309
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:22,880
what the,
this is the fact that you have to face,

1310
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:25,010
and this is why I told them
this way and the kid story,

1311
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:28,970
he didn't understand when
he made that mistake,

1312
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,720
he didn't understand that there are
some mistakes you cannot recover from.

1313
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:36,590
He can't be a pilot now.
It's not going to happen.

1314
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:40,880
Zero chance of him being a military pilot.
That's the way it works.

1315
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:45,230
So if I would have had the opportunity
to tell him when he was 13 years old,

1316
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:49,190
hey listen bro, I get it. You're going
to step outside the box sometimes,

1317
01:17:49,191 --> 01:17:51,800
but there's some mistakes that you can
make that you'll never be able to recover

1318
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,020
from. So think about what
you're doing before you do them.

1319
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:56,600
You need to think about what
you're doing before you do them.

1320
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:01,130
And if I were to have the opportunity to
tell him that when he was 13 years old,

1321
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,250
he might've had a better decision
making process when he got older.

1322
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:08,210
That's why I left it that way for those
kids so that they recognize that there

1323
01:18:08,211 --> 01:18:11,990
are some things that you do
as a, as a person, as a kid,

1324
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:16,220
that you cannot recover from. You
cannot recover from them. Hmm.

1325
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,860
Now that being said,

1326
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:22,850
when you take this and you put it in
perspective as an adult can, as an adult,

1327
01:18:22,851 --> 01:18:26,240
you have much broader
world to be a part of.

1328
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:31,070
And just because he's not going to be
a pilot, a military pilot, by the way,

1329
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,350
just because he's not
gonna be a military pilot.

1330
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,300
There's all kinds of other
opportunities out there.

1331
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:37,820
And you can explain that to an adult.
But it's hard to explain that to a kid.

1332
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:41,360
So what other opportunities,
I mean you even if especially like,

1333
01:18:41,390 --> 01:18:44,540
oh you want to be a pilot, cool, you
can become a civilian pilot and you can,

1334
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,660
you know, you can fly and you
can make things happen that way.

1335
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:54,190
But what we're not going to do and what
I would not do is dwell on the past and

1336
01:18:54,291 --> 01:18:58,240
dwell on what the big missed opportunity
is. Because guess what? That's an,

1337
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:01,940
that's a missed opportunity that there's
all kinds of people in the world would

1338
01:19:01,941 --> 01:19:04,870
love for that to be their biggest
mistake that they've made. That's the,

1339
01:19:04,871 --> 01:19:06,170
that's it.
They would love,

1340
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:08,690
there's someone sitting in prison
right now that's like, man,

1341
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:12,560
I wish all I did was get a fail a drug
test and I could have learned my lesson.

1342
01:19:12,561 --> 01:19:17,561
Instead I'm sitting here in prison or
I got injured really bad cause I did

1343
01:19:18,591 --> 01:19:21,860
something that I shouldn't have done or
I made a bad decision or I got someone

1344
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:26,600
that I care about hurt or injured because
I took them in a car when I was drunk.

1345
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:31,400
Like those are the kind of mistake, this
mistake. Sure. It's a bummer. Guess what?

1346
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:34,760
There are infinitely, infinitely worse
mistakes that he could have made.

1347
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,490
Infinitely worse.
So

1348
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:42,890
you're all right, man.
You're okay. Learn from it.

1349
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,690
Don't dwell on it. Move on and go, go do
something really positive in the world.

1350
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:52,910
Yeah.
Next question.

1351
01:19:54,530 --> 01:19:59,210
Hey Jocko, what can we do with
a coworker who isn't on board?

1352
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,880
When someone brings up something to him,

1353
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:05,810
he gets defensive and turns it
into being everyone else's problem.

1354
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:12,430
And this was a Twitter
question, by the way. And uh,

1355
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,810
and I answered it and I answered it
really simply, really straight forward.

1356
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:17,390
Take ownership of the
problem and solve it.

1357
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:20,360
Take ownership of the problem and fix it,
right?

1358
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:25,160
Because think about what's happening here,
right? What the person is saying like,

1359
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:29,330
Oh, this is me saying, oh, echo
won't take ownership of the problem.

1360
01:20:29,331 --> 01:20:31,800
And every time I tell him
he does something wrong, he
just gets defensive, right?

1361
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:35,960
So I'll, I'll, I mean obviously I'm
not communicating with you well enough.

1362
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:39,260
If all I'm doing is blaming you and
you're getting defensive. And by the way,

1363
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:43,700
if I'm the type of person that takes
ownership of things, why am I blaming you?

1364
01:20:43,701 --> 01:20:46,340
In the first place,
I should be looking at myself.

1365
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:48,480
Okay?

1366
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,250
I should be looking at my
stuff. And by the way, if Echo,

1367
01:20:50,251 --> 01:20:52,530
if you point your fingers at me
and you say, Hey, this is my fault.

1368
01:20:52,650 --> 01:20:53,610
You know what I say? Yeah, I agree.

1369
01:20:53,611 --> 01:20:55,950
It is my fault and here's what
I'm going to do to fix it.

1370
01:20:57,540 --> 01:21:01,260
Now I'm not going to rub it in your
face. I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna do it.

1371
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:03,300
So I prove a point.
That's not what I'm doing.

1372
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,090
I'm actually doing it because I want to,
when I'm actually doing it,

1373
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:07,470
because I want to accomplish the mission.

1374
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,150
That's why I'm going to fix the problem.

1375
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:10,243
Hmm.

1376
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:14,720
Now, if we have a weak member of the
team that doesn't take ownership thing,

1377
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:17,720
guess what? It's my responsibility to
take ownership of the problem and fix it.

1378
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:18,703
And eventually,

1379
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,410
but the good thing about this is if you
make an excuse about something and I

1380
01:21:21,411 --> 01:21:24,260
fixed that excuse and then you make
an excuse about something else,

1381
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:25,123
I fixed that one.

1382
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,380
And then you make an excuse about
something else and I fixed that one.

1383
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,330
Eventually.
There's no more excuses for you.

1384
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:35,200
And now you're left with what you can
actually handle as echo with no more

1385
01:21:35,541 --> 01:21:39,260
excuses to make. And then either you're
capable, you're not in. By the way,

1386
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:40,190
guess what,
as the leader,

1387
01:21:40,191 --> 01:21:45,191
then it becomes my job to
get rid of you if you can't,

1388
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:50,600
if you cannot do the thing that I asked
you to do or that you're supposed to do

1389
01:21:50,601 --> 01:21:55,500
for the team. So yeah,

1390
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:57,190
because I mean eventually if you,
if,

1391
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,860
if I keep stepping up and
taking things away from you,

1392
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:04,030
there's not gonna be any more excuses
and you'll either end up with no

1393
01:22:04,031 --> 01:22:07,360
responsibility and therefore no
value and then you have no job.

1394
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,940
That's the way it works.
Now, let me ask you this.

1395
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:17,610
When is there a time that a subordinate

1396
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:23,280
does something and it's
not the leaders fault?

1397
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:26,430
So,
so think about this.

1398
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:31,970
W W E and when something goes
wrong with a team member,

1399
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:37,500
when is it not the leaders fault?

1400
01:22:37,501 --> 01:22:42,501
So if you've got a machine gunner and
the machine gunner shoots outside of his

1401
01:22:42,901 --> 01:22:46,890
field of fire, clearly he didn't
pay attention during the brief.

1402
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:47,903
That's the problem.

1403
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:53,760
If I have a machine gunner that
engages non hostile targets,

1404
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:57,000
it's the machine gunner his fault
because he didn't do improper.

1405
01:22:57,150 --> 01:23:01,230
He did improper positive identification
of its targets and engaged

1406
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:05,890
a friendlies or,
or at least hostels.

1407
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:09,990
So that's the machine goes wrong or the
machine gunners at weapon goes down.

1408
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,420
Yeah

1409
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,130
because the machine gunner didn't click,

1410
01:23:13,190 --> 01:23:15,950
it's his fault cause he didn't clean his
weapon, maintain his weapon properly.

1411
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:18,890
The machine gunners fault.
So all those things,

1412
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:20,670
the machine gunner shoots
out of his field of fire.

1413
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:23,390
The machine gunner engages non hostile
targets and machine gunners weapon goes

1414
01:23:23,391 --> 01:23:26,330
down all those of the machine
gunners fault clearly.

1415
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:27,853
Okay.

1416
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:34,660
Or maybe not so clearly because here's
how I would look at those things.

1417
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:36,590
Cause by the way,
when I point,

1418
01:23:36,650 --> 01:23:39,050
if you're my machine gun and I put my
finger at you and start yelling at you and

1419
01:23:39,051 --> 01:23:41,690
telling you that you did something wrong,
obviously we know what happens.

1420
01:23:41,691 --> 01:23:44,170
You start making excuses and
blaming other people and,

1421
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,960
and you don't accepting responsibility
cause you get defensive.

1422
01:23:47,961 --> 01:23:50,420
And that's what people do.
So for me,

1423
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,780
and what a good leader
does is a good leader.

1424
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:59,250
When the machine gunner shoots out of
his field of fire, the leader says, Oh,

1425
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:03,600
you know what? I didn't explain the
fields of fire clearly enough for you.

1426
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:07,800
I'm sorry, I'll fix it. Machine
gunner engages on non-hostile target.

1427
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,020
Then the leader says,
Hey,

1428
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:14,310
I should have given you better
training on a target identification.

1429
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:16,530
We will go back and fix that.

1430
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:18,730
Yeah.

1431
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:23,080
Or the machine gunners, a weapon goes
down. It means that I, as the leader,

1432
01:24:23,081 --> 01:24:26,200
you know what? I should've done
a better job inspecting weapons.

1433
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:31,300
I should have explained how important
the maintenance was. That's my fault.

1434
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:32,650
I won't let it happen again.

1435
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:34,490
Okay.

1436
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:38,720
So even in these instances where it's
real easy to blame the, the individual,

1437
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:44,130
all good leader instead of blaming the
individual will take ownership of the

1438
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:48,740
problem. That's what you do.
And that's what's going on.

1439
01:24:48,741 --> 01:24:51,300
In this case, you've got a
coworker that's not on board and,

1440
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,920
and just gets defensive and turns it into
everyone else's problem. That's right.

1441
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,520
Grab ownership of those problems.
And by the way,

1442
01:24:58,521 --> 01:25:00,650
that the subordinate that's
not taking ownership,

1443
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:05,990
that's your fault as a leader and the way
that you get someone to take ownership

1444
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:08,930
isn't by saying, Hey, don't get defensive.

1445
01:25:08,931 --> 01:25:10,460
You need to take
ownership of this problem.

1446
01:25:10,461 --> 01:25:14,330
It's your problem that doesn't
make people take ownership.

1447
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:17,960
Here's the tricky part.
Here's the black belt situation.

1448
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:22,070
The blackbelt situation is if I want
you to take ownership instead of blaming

1449
01:25:22,071 --> 01:25:24,650
you, I'm going to take, I'm going
to take ownership of the problem.

1450
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:29,530
I'm going to relieve you of that and now
you're going to go way out. No, no, no.

1451
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:32,870
With that, that the, no, I should
be able to fix that. I'm sorry boss.

1452
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:34,850
I'm sorry Jocko.
I should have shot my,

1453
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,440
I shouldn't have shot
outside the field of fire.

1454
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,990
I need to pay better attention during
the brief if I don't know what it was.

1455
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:43,190
I'm going to ask questions next
time. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

1456
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:45,800
Please let me get it fixed.

1457
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:49,310
And that is how you get
someone to take ownership.

1458
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,070
You don't get people to take ownership
by telling them to take ownership of

1459
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:52,904
things.

1460
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:59,060
And there's a little dichotomy here too
because if it's a plan than the way I

1461
01:25:59,061 --> 01:26:01,520
get you to take ownership of it is by
saying, hey, echo, come up with a plan.

1462
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,950
Like we talked about
standard procedures earlier.

1463
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,800
If I come up with a standard operating
procedures myself and then I forced him

1464
01:26:06,801 --> 01:26:09,950
onto you. You don't take ownership
of those. Yeah, those are mine.

1465
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,230
So I have to give you ownership.

1466
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:14,750
But when it's a negative it's when it's
a positive thing, I give it to you.

1467
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:16,580
When it's a negative thing,
I take it,

1468
01:26:21,490 --> 01:26:24,610
I take it positive thing,
give it,

1469
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,950
cause people want that positive thing.
When it's a negative thing,

1470
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:34,240
they don't want it. You take
it from him and by the way,

1471
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:35,770
when it's a positive thing
and you give it to them,

1472
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:38,500
guess what they want to do with it. They
want to share it. They want to do it.

1473
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:42,310
When it's a negative thing and you forced
on them, they want to get rid of it.

1474
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:45,370
Okay,

1475
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,660
so there you go.

1476
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:51,130
I'm glad that this person's in the game
and now they know how to handle this

1477
01:26:51,131 --> 01:26:53,110
coworker and make it
into a good situation.

1478
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,380
I think we've got time for one more

1479
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,090
last question, Jacqueline. Hey Jocko.

1480
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:08,280
How do you implement change
when you know it is needed?

1481
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:15,190
How do you implement change when
you know what is needed to? Well,

1482
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,450
when I know I need to change something,

1483
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,130
what I do is I change it.

1484
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:29,220
That's what I do.
I change it

1485
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:36,140
and I've had people that listen to the
podcast and they've reached out to me

1486
01:27:37,351 --> 01:27:42,351
over the past few years and one of the
main messages that they took and put into

1487
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:51,670
action was actually putting things
into action. Whatever that was, they,

1488
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:56,210
they stopped eating sugar,
they stopped sleeping in,

1489
01:27:56,211 --> 01:27:57,950
they started waking up early.
They,

1490
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:03,280
they quit playing video games
for 10 or 12 or 14 hours a day.

1491
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:08,030
They sold that x box thing.

1492
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:15,130
There was a guy that bit his nails for
his whole life and he's in his thirties

1493
01:28:15,620 --> 01:28:18,630
eh? Well, whatever. No big deals,
right? You know, he bit his nails. Well,

1494
01:28:18,650 --> 01:28:19,220
you know what,

1495
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:22,610
his nails are all chewed up and they're
bloody and their gross looking at east

1496
01:28:22,690 --> 01:28:26,330
self conscious when he's meeting people
and shaking hands and he can't keep his

1497
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:31,331
hands away from his mouth while he's in
meetings or in interacting with people.

1498
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:38,240
But he couldn't stop
and then he stopped.

1499
01:28:39,630 --> 01:28:42,210
He just stopped and the list goes on.

1500
01:28:43,510 --> 01:28:45,370
There's people that have quit drinking.

1501
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:48,880
I quit doing drugs and
quit losing their temper.

1502
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:54,180
And I've heard from so many different
people that have implemented change in

1503
01:28:55,361 --> 01:28:56,280
their lives.
So,

1504
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,730
so many letters and messages and notes.

1505
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:06,140
And I want you to know that these people
aren't a bunch of of elite special

1506
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:09,570
operations warriors.
That's not who they are.

1507
01:29:09,571 --> 01:29:14,571
They aren't a bunch of high level athletes
or highly screened in highly trained

1508
01:29:17,221 --> 01:29:18,054
individuals.

1509
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,030
Okay?

1510
01:29:20,030 --> 01:29:23,150
These are just just normal people really.

1511
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:30,370
But they're normal people that
knew they needed to make a change.

1512
01:29:31,490 --> 01:29:32,010
Okay.

1513
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:37,010
And they decided they were going to
make a change and then they made it.

1514
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:46,980
And that is what I do.

1515
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:51,010
And that is what you can do too.

1516
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:53,920
If you have something to change.

1517
01:29:53,950 --> 01:29:58,480
If you want to change something,
change it.

1518
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:06,130
Change it
now.

1519
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:10,203
Okay.

1520
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:11,560
Yeah.
And I think that's

1521
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,040
all I've got for tonight's.
So Echo.

1522
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:22,660
Speaking of
implementing change and

1523
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:27,490
change in our lives to
become a little bit better,

1524
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:31,870
maybe you could help us with some things
that can make us sure. But better.

1525
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:37,000
Sure. First, what's up with Mike in
the dragons, Mikey and the drugs. Yes.

1526
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:39,940
So Mikey and the dragons is

1527
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:41,960
okay

1528
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:46,700
released into the world now.
Okay. So speaking of ownership,

1529
01:30:46,701 --> 01:30:51,260
and I know the one of the
earlier questions was about
ownership and I have to

1530
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:55,880
take ownership myself at this
time because I made a mistake.

1531
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,960
I made a mistake. And just
as I, as you pointed out,

1532
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:07,130
as I've talked about my publisher not
ordering enough books and how, Hey,

1533
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:10,190
they don't order enough books,
they don't get it. Well guess what,

1534
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:12,620
I didn't order enough books.

1535
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:17,870
So I am getting them printed right now.

1536
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:23,040
I'm getting them printed as
fast as humanly possible. Um,

1537
01:31:23,690 --> 01:31:28,130
we have multiple printers
working and if you order early,

1538
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:31,040
you're likely going to get
yours on the release date.

1539
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:34,560
And I know some people had
been posting their Amazon, uh,

1540
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:37,400
images that they're miking
the dragons is shipping.

1541
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:40,960
So some people are going to get it soon.
Uh,

1542
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:44,840
but even that's not a guarantee at
this point. Even if you ordered early,

1543
01:31:44,841 --> 01:31:47,900
I apologize. Don't blame
Amazon. It's not their fault.

1544
01:31:47,901 --> 01:31:52,010
Don't blame FedEx and don't blame the
post office and don't blame ups is not

1545
01:31:52,011 --> 01:31:56,120
their fault if you don't get the book
on time. It is one person's fault.

1546
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:57,140
And that is mine.

1547
01:31:57,200 --> 01:32:02,200
I should have done a much
job of estimating how many
books you all were going to

1548
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:04,774
buy.

1549
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:09,160
And I guess as soon as I saw
people that were ordering 12 books,

1550
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:12,730
12 miking the dragons, that should
have been real indicator that I,

1551
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:17,020
that I should have gotten more printed.
But I didn't do that.

1552
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:20,950
I apologize. Um, you
guys have ordered a ton.

1553
01:32:21,190 --> 01:32:25,240
And so this point,
I have a ton more being printed.

1554
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,760
My goal is to get them
to you by Christmas.

1555
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:31,540
It should be possible if you order now,
we've got enough coming in.

1556
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:36,600
They should be there to get in
the stockings for Christmas if,

1557
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:41,900
if you've already ordered. So if
you've ordered though, be patient. Um,

1558
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:47,550
if you haven't ordered yet ordered like
right now so that I can print more.

1559
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:54,300
And like I said right now we should have
enough, if you order right now, w you,

1560
01:32:54,301 --> 01:32:57,310
you should be able to get it by Christmas.
Um,

1561
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,730
and if you want it,
yeah,

1562
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:05,380
just order it and I'll just get as
many printed as we need. I apologize.

1563
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,490
It's, it's definitely
my fault. I was weak.

1564
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:14,350
I was, no, it was, I used to call
it week and then you'd be like,

1565
01:33:14,351 --> 01:33:16,810
they're just being conservative.
So I was too conservative.

1566
01:33:16,811 --> 01:33:21,160
I balanced it too much
in the wrong direction.

1567
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:26,460
And so order the book and I appreciate
of the few people that I've sent a copy

1568
01:33:27,251 --> 01:33:31,480
to, the feedback has been
awesome. Um, the book in,

1569
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,530
in the words of John Bozak who did
the drawing into the art and the,

1570
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:39,200
you're going to see, he's the same guy
that did the art for way the warrior care.

1571
01:33:39,210 --> 01:33:44,050
This art is a totally different deal
because it's beautiful. It's color,

1572
01:33:44,110 --> 01:33:48,070
it's vibrant. Yeah. He did an amazing job.

1573
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,030
Um, and you know what he says,
like he's, you know, he said to me,

1574
01:33:52,720 --> 01:33:56,770
he's like the annual people say things
and they say it in a certain way.

1575
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:02,710
He did that. He just goes,
this book is special.

1576
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:06,860
And I was like, you know, the way
he said it was like, I was like,

1577
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:12,100
and I feel that way, but you
know, of course I'm biased
because I wrote it right.

1578
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:16,330
But when, when he drew it, so he's biased
too, but he didn't say it like, Hey,

1579
01:34:16,331 --> 01:34:20,620
this book is awesome. Normal voice.
He was like, he was like, Hey,

1580
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:25,390
this book is, this book is really
special. And I was like, okay.

1581
01:34:25,570 --> 01:34:28,960
So I think this book is going
to go in every kid's bookshelf.

1582
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:32,230
I think it's going to be right next to
their copy of where the wild things are.

1583
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:34,730
That's what I think, which was, you know,

1584
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:38,200
all of our favorite book when you're a
kid. And I know that's a bold statement,

1585
01:34:38,740 --> 01:34:41,080
but anyways, I think it's gonna
have a great impact on kids.

1586
01:34:41,081 --> 01:34:45,760
So if you want a copy for your kids, for
your neighbor, kids, for your library,

1587
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:50,020
your school, whenever
classrooms, um, for yourself,

1588
01:34:51,220 --> 01:34:55,520
for yourself. Yes. If
you're 38 years old, sure.

1589
01:34:56,050 --> 01:35:00,950
And you want to learn a little
something about the world,

1590
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,600
about overcoming fear,

1591
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:07,370
about how to face thing and you want to
have it put an IV in such a clear way,

1592
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:12,830
then get yourself a copy.
So, right. Echo agree.

1593
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:14,990
And you've read it. I
mean obviously, yes sir.

1594
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:19,820
And you've read it to your youngsters.
Yes, I have. And they're approved.

1595
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:24,380
Approved. Yeah. She wants me to
read it again. Well, this one,

1596
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:29,000
this is a book that takes 20 minutes
to read. Yeah. Maybe 20 maybe.

1597
01:35:29,001 --> 01:35:33,770
I've been around 20 minutes to
read. Yeah. So it rhymes. Yeah.

1598
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:38,660
Which is fun. Yes. And
impactful and little kids,

1599
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:43,070
they love it. When those things
wrong, they follow it, they follow it.

1600
01:35:43,071 --> 01:35:46,250
So there you go. If you want one
again, I apologize if you're not,

1601
01:35:46,251 --> 01:35:51,140
if you don't get it on the 15th of
November, my goal is to add a minimum.

1602
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:53,210
Some of you are going to get it on the 50.
If you ordered early,

1603
01:35:53,211 --> 01:35:57,680
hopefully you'll get it by then. But my
goal, let's get it to you by Christmas.

1604
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:02,240
I've got publishers all over our
printers all over printing it.

1605
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:04,040
So thank you.

1606
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:08,120
And that's that Mikey and the dragons

1607
01:36:08,590 --> 01:36:12,500
order. Real quick, uh, what else? What
else do we need? Well, how else can we,

1608
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:16,820
can we implement change in our life?
Sure. Well, led Jujitsu talk today.

1609
01:36:16,821 --> 01:36:18,950
Once you know the way broadly,

1610
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:23,530
you will in fact see it as a thing.

1611
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:28,430
So when you are exploring
the road of Jujitsu,

1612
01:36:28,431 --> 01:36:33,050
you're going to need a g. Even if you
do just know get well. If you don't,

1613
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:34,700
if you only do Gnocchi
then I guess you don't.

1614
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:40,670
But when you are searching for
ag, get origin g, that's it.

1615
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:44,780
100%. Um, go to origin main.com.

1616
01:36:44,781 --> 01:36:47,960
That's where you get a rash guards in
there and just well all made in America,

1617
01:36:48,050 --> 01:36:52,320
woven in America, in America,
cotton, all the cock grown,

1618
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:56,900
grown into American America woven in
America by the way. It's not just cotton.

1619
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:02,240
Yeah, it's a special blend. And
especial we've bio a special we've,

1620
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:04,640
how cool is that? We've
like, like no kidding.

1621
01:37:04,641 --> 01:37:08,420
When you see dragon we've for the first
time, why are you not like a little bit,

1622
01:37:09,650 --> 01:37:13,910
a little bit what? Impressed. Impressed.
So here's the thing too, when you,

1623
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:16,400
when you kind of been in the
game for a long time, let's say,

1624
01:37:16,490 --> 01:37:21,230
you're not easily impressed by ds. No.
You, well, no. Yeah, no, not, not Jay.

1625
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,900
Generally speaking. No.
But you do pay attention.

1626
01:37:23,901 --> 01:37:25,580
Like you know when you grab a geek,
your own gay,

1627
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,340
you really used to your own gifts.
You have two gs,

1628
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:30,170
three gs for Huggies and they're all
kind of different ways. You know those,

1629
01:37:30,171 --> 01:37:33,010
right? So when you see someone else with
the g, you grab it, you're like, okay, no,

1630
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,270
I'm familiar, whatever. Cool.

1631
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:38,060
But when you grab the dragon
weed for the first time,

1632
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:40,610
especially when you've been in the
game for a while, you're like, Ooh,

1633
01:37:40,611 --> 01:37:42,580
this one is different.
Like, like that. Yeah.

1634
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:45,600
Well I've definitely had a couple
people that only got into Jujitsu,

1635
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:48,740
like they've only Dave
Burke. Good Dude. Yeah.

1636
01:37:48,830 --> 01:37:51,470
He's only had origin Giesen he's punches.

1637
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:54,650
He doesn't even know what all
these other stories about bad games

1638
01:37:56,550 --> 01:38:01,530
like, oh, they just stink and
they're heavy and all the written,

1639
01:38:01,531 --> 01:38:04,080
all that stuff. He doesn't know any
better to be that. You're just like, oh,

1640
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:08,250
everything is awesome in a way. I
mean, I kind of want to say, Hey Dang,

1641
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:12,240
that's good for him. He's lucky
in that way, but you know, hey,

1642
01:38:12,241 --> 01:38:15,180
that's part of the game.
It's part of the journey nonetheless,

1643
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:18,240
whether you use do it or not used to it,
dragging the weave is legit.

1644
01:38:18,300 --> 01:38:22,200
Are we allowed to talk about that new
weave that we were exploring the other day

1645
01:38:22,201 --> 01:38:24,730
at your house? Uh, not
yet. Okay. Do you have,

1646
01:38:24,810 --> 01:38:29,810
are we going to keep our beaks buttoned
on now on don't forget about rash guards

1647
01:38:30,061 --> 01:38:32,030
though. Yes, of course.
So when you're doing Nogi,

1648
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:36,360
some people that use the tee shirt, I
dig it so they use a dry fit. I did it.

1649
01:38:36,780 --> 01:38:39,300
To me, rash guard is the
way to go. This is why,

1650
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,960
because other people's toes sometimes
not all the time could get caught in that

1651
01:38:45,241 --> 01:38:49,790
shirt when it's flapping around in
the wind, but true. And you know, hey,

1652
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:52,350
you know it's a rash guard. It's
cool. It looks more uniform. Me.

1653
01:38:52,351 --> 01:38:56,220
What about this scientific compression?

1654
01:38:56,550 --> 01:39:01,530
Increased vascularity on, I'm just
kidding. Hey Man, I'm sure there is.

1655
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:06,580
There is that where the rash card when
you wear the compression clothing?

1656
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:10,260
Yeah. Like health with after into
something like, and that's cool.

1657
01:39:10,450 --> 01:39:13,650
I'm not over here making those
plans. Yeah. I am making this claim.

1658
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:18,770
19% improvement when you were the rash
guard based on your whole mental state.

1659
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,850
Yes. Agree. Yeah.

1660
01:39:23,220 --> 01:39:27,930
And not to mention speaking to mental
state on those days that you don't want to

1661
01:39:27,931 --> 01:39:31,260
train, get a new rash guard.
Those days they don't exist.

1662
01:39:31,261 --> 01:39:35,400
Don't exist anymore for four months.
Then you did another new rash guard.

1663
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:40,560
She'll give or take. It's true. So
yeah. Cool. The compression. Cool.

1664
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:44,130
Cool. Yeah. Pete was actually starting
to go into it with me. Hey Man,

1665
01:39:44,131 --> 01:39:47,000
I could tell you, I'm like, well I'll
go man, let me call you back here.

1666
01:39:47,001 --> 01:39:52,001
We just go 19% and 19% based on
mental state getting after it harder.

1667
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:56,610
Yes, I agree. So yes, some good
rash guards on there. Also some, uh,

1668
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:59,250
well how should I say?
Lounge gear

1669
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:05,170
that violates your whole thing that
violates everything lounge. Anyways,

1670
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:08,190
that's the luxury.
You can call them luxury items.

1671
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:12,550
You luxury Oh von here to talk about
luxury. Oh, just the concept of luxury.

1672
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:16,830
Luxury, luxury days. Well the
sweats that they have are luxury.

1673
01:40:16,831 --> 01:40:19,500
And here's the thing, unprompted,
I go on Twitter and you know,

1674
01:40:19,501 --> 01:40:21,780
you get like people, when they get
their stuff, they're like, hey,

1675
01:40:21,781 --> 01:40:24,870
you mean you take a picture of
your stuff normal. So we've got,

1676
01:40:24,871 --> 01:40:29,250
we'll have a hoodie and he'll say,
this is the softest Hoodie I ever had.

1677
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:34,320
That's the, that is the fact.
That is a fact. And then there's,

1678
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:37,140
I didn't understand this joggers.
Yes.

1679
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:42,950
I didn't understand why they're called
joggers and what their purpose is.

1680
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:49,380
Old School sweat pants. Yeah. They're
just, there's like an elastic,

1681
01:40:49,381 --> 01:40:52,670
they're like straight cut than there's
elastic thing around the bottom of that

1682
01:40:52,671 --> 01:40:56,980
kind of stall baggy. Sure. The purpose
apparently did you tell me this?

1683
01:40:56,981 --> 01:41:01,981
That joggers are cut tighter and then
they have like a tighter ankle so you can

1684
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:06,220
actually jog in them. That's the purpose.
So the group, I didn't know that.

1685
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,610
I had no idea. So when you jog,
they don't flap around in the wind.

1686
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,340
It's not just thankful the whole leg,
the whole leg kind of adheres to you.

1687
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:17,200
It's more like fit into your leg and
then they're more roomy in the hips so he

1688
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:20,560
can have a, you know, you can spray
it and jog. You can run seem sane.

1689
01:41:21,010 --> 01:41:21,880
They just so happen.

1690
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:26,940
And that mobility that it allows for
running translates hundred and 10% to just

1691
01:41:28,721 --> 01:41:30,580
cruising.
When you're laying down on the,

1692
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:32,650
I'm telling me hundred
percent take it from me.

1693
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:36,490
I know there's some supplements
on there too. We've got some,

1694
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:40,040
we got some supplements.
As a matter of fact. Um,

1695
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:45,970
joint warfare number one bestseller,
joint warfare.

1696
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:50,830
I see. Why a Krill oil. Yeah. What? Okay.

1697
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:55,300
So a lot of people ask this too and
you told him, okay, the difference,

1698
01:41:55,360 --> 01:42:00,280
you know how the still guy would be like,
hey, I work a physical job eight hours,

1699
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:01,120
10 hours a day.

1700
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:04,240
I want to do a workout or wherever
my joints take kind of a beating.

1701
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,900
What should I take? Joint
warfare or Krill oil. So people,

1702
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:09,930
they will wonder about that.
Which one should I take?

1703
01:42:09,931 --> 01:42:13,030
Cause they're both for your joint
and the straight up answer is yes.

1704
01:42:13,031 --> 01:42:15,040
Take both of them.
You should absolutely take both of them.

1705
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:17,560
If you can only get one.

1706
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:21,970
If I would say if you're just,
if you're just feeling,

1707
01:42:22,690 --> 01:42:24,520
um,
what's the word?

1708
01:42:24,850 --> 01:42:29,380
Like if you have like legitimate soreness,
real legit soreness,

1709
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:31,780
I would go with for warfare.

1710
01:42:32,710 --> 01:42:37,180
But I like Krill and I've thing is
I've taken the these things for so long

1711
01:42:37,181 --> 01:42:41,640
together that I just, I don't know. It's
hard for me to answer that. Yeah. Well,

1712
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:46,540
Brian would tell me that
Krill oil is for just general,

1713
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:49,390
you know, maintenance, you know,
you're getting, let's face it,

1714
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:54,470
you're getting older and you got to
maintain it to maintain not getting old,

1715
01:42:56,170 --> 01:43:00,310
probably not and together. Yeah.
Like how you were saying, you know,

1716
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:02,380
your drink to take a beating,

1717
01:43:02,381 --> 01:43:05,110
like a actual beating where
they kinda hurt now then yeah.

1718
01:43:05,111 --> 01:43:07,870
Joint Warfare Cause it helps inflammation.
Well actually the Krill oil I'll take,

1719
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,820
I got fired,
I got fired up today.

1720
01:43:09,821 --> 01:43:14,710
I did my workout are through on the
weight vest. Oh yeah. And I just did,

1721
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:17,830
I just pretended like I didn't have
it on but I had it on for my workout.

1722
01:43:18,180 --> 01:43:21,380
He probably, you know, that helps,
you know, mental state to be like,

1723
01:43:21,610 --> 01:43:26,530
so it's a difference between like, like
you can lift in these different ways too.

1724
01:43:26,531 --> 01:43:28,600
But yeah, when you put weights
on you just like, you know,

1725
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:30,570
some people they'll swing a
baseball bat or something,

1726
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:33,350
they'll put a weight on there, something
like that. And mentally if you,

1727
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:37,750
basically you're training
your functionality with that
and that resistance sorta,

1728
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:41,050
it just happens to be there. So your
brain just kind of accommodates, you know,

1729
01:43:41,051 --> 01:43:44,020
so when you function without the weight
to just flying around, it's like easy.

1730
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:46,960
It's like I weigh less now,
you know, rather than an, Ooh,

1731
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:50,650
I'm going to just eke out 10
reps of this very specific thing.

1732
01:43:50,651 --> 01:43:51,560
Then you're training your body.

1733
01:43:52,030 --> 01:43:55,610
I did Kinda did this little like a
mental debate, like, Oh, well, you know,

1734
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:58,250
I feel like I should, I should do
something a little bit more. Oh,

1735
01:43:58,251 --> 01:44:00,980
maybe I'll do some rounds with this
and then I'll take it and they'll just

1736
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,660
ignore. I'm just going to do
the whole thing. Like I just,

1737
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:07,520
and I did every exercise, even just
completely unrelated exercises with,

1738
01:44:07,530 --> 01:44:10,760
with a weight vest on. Yeah, man, that's
good. I was doing box jumps the other day,

1739
01:44:10,761 --> 01:44:15,710
which I did, and I was like, man,
here's the warning on box jumps.

1740
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:19,790
Pay attention during box jumps you,
it's real easy, especially when you get,

1741
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:21,860
when you get smoked and
you start just kind of,

1742
01:44:21,861 --> 01:44:24,440
you're just going through the
motions and that's when you miss,

1743
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:29,540
when you miss the box, jump
to get that Shinar no fun.
Yeah, yeah, no, and, and, yes,

1744
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:32,370
and that's what I was thinking too. I was
like, man, when I could say, you know,

1745
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:36,230
this is part of the metcon. I was going
back and forth. It's a long thing,

1746
01:44:36,231 --> 01:44:38,630
but Blackstone was part of it and yes,

1747
01:44:38,690 --> 01:44:43,190
towards those later rounds I was
like, okay, I'd better good. Yeah.

1748
01:44:43,370 --> 01:44:45,680
And I was doing it. I was adding a
little something, you know when you,

1749
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,640
when you jumped down, I went down into
a little squat, then did the jump.

1750
01:44:50,110 --> 01:44:53,630
So it's not just the box, it's like
dumb squat ball anyway. But yes.

1751
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:55,490
And made me think like,
Whoa,

1752
01:44:55,610 --> 01:45:00,330
I could get a weight vest and really
maximize the spa box jumps, pay attention,

1753
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:03,680
pay attention. It takes some
discipline beforehand too, by the way,

1754
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:05,900
which is a little pre mission.
Get some.

1755
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:08,750
And then if you need food,

1756
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:14,920
if you need nutrients for your body
and for your mind didn't take milk,

1757
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:22,400
milk tastes delicious.
You know what I did yesterday?

1758
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:26,090
I took whipping cream,

1759
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:31,040
heavy whipping cream that you
turn into whipped whipped cream.

1760
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:34,760
But normally what you put in it
know how to make whipped cream. Yes.

1761
01:45:34,910 --> 01:45:39,110
What do you do? Whip. It's super hard
to do at an egg white in it. Nope.

1762
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:42,260
You got to add sugar. Oh, okay.

1763
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:47,440
So recently I read this thing that one
of the whipped cream companies came out

1764
01:45:49,011 --> 01:45:51,650
with like Reese's peanut butter,

1765
01:45:51,651 --> 01:45:56,420
whipped cream and some other
kind of whipped cream. So
you get it in their spray.

1766
01:45:56,421 --> 01:46:00,350
Can you press the little nozzle?
Boom.

1767
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:05,000
You got Reese's peanut butter
flavor, whipped cream. And
I thought to myself, Yup,

1768
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:09,420
that sounds
boy that's the freedom part.

1769
01:46:09,421 --> 01:46:10,550
So guess what I did,

1770
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:16,600
I took heavy whipping cream that you
make whip cream with and I put peanut

1771
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:22,160
butter milk in it and I whipped it.
And guess what?

1772
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:26,030
While la is good to go,

1773
01:46:26,031 --> 01:46:31,031
people like tastiness tastiness so yeah.

1774
01:46:31,410 --> 01:46:34,070
Uh, and all of them tastes great.
All of them are awesome for you.

1775
01:46:34,640 --> 01:46:38,750
And we got mint peanut butter, we have
meant chocolate, peanut butter, chocolate,

1776
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,410
vanilla gorilla and of
course the darkness,

1777
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,590
chocolate and then warrior kid,

1778
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:50,910
Warrior kid milk of which look, they both
taste delicious. As a matter of fact,

1779
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:55,410
my son today cause it was getting cold
and I hate saying that because we're in

1780
01:46:55,411 --> 01:46:59,370
California and cold is not cold.
So everyone in Michigan, everyone,

1781
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,780
Pete the crew up in Maine, I apologize
cause it was getting cold this morning,

1782
01:47:03,781 --> 01:47:07,650
which meant it was probably
like 54. Yeah, right.

1783
01:47:07,810 --> 01:47:11,070
Which out here in California, in
southern California, it's like,

1784
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:14,130
oh it was cold this morning. So
anyways, it was a little chilly.

1785
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:16,230
This is more a little nip in the air of
course were only wearing shorts and a

1786
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:20,310
tee shirt. So sure in Maine, I know
Pete's up there wearing a Parka,

1787
01:47:21,870 --> 01:47:23,580
but my son,

1788
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:28,250
he was jumping on his bike
to go check the waves and um,

1789
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:32,010
he had a little,
he had a little like a coffee tumbler,

1790
01:47:32,011 --> 01:47:34,740
one of our tumblers and he doesn't
drink coffee now. Kind of like what,

1791
01:47:34,741 --> 01:47:37,830
what are you doing? He goes,
I made some hot cocoa Mo.

1792
01:47:39,510 --> 01:47:42,850
And I said, let me try it with the
warrior. The warrior could talk.

1793
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:46,800
It's just delicious. It's
just amazing. It's like, oh,

1794
01:47:47,060 --> 01:47:50,220
it's our cocoa except for guess what?
It's good for you. And makes you strong.

1795
01:47:51,300 --> 01:47:54,690
What's up with that? That's good.
What's up with that? So yeah,

1796
01:47:54,750 --> 01:47:58,260
that's the bulk anyways. Strawberries.
Delicious. It's get it for your kids.

1797
01:47:58,261 --> 01:47:59,340
It's in my house.

1798
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:02,160
It seems to be the only thing anyone
in my house is eating right now.

1799
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:07,140
So give that a shot and enjoy it.
You're going to be Matt.

1800
01:48:07,170 --> 01:48:11,760
I think he might be. What's a park? A park
is just a coat. It's a big winter coat.

1801
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:15,480
Yeah. Yeah. You ever seen the coat
that has like a fur around the hood?

1802
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:19,680
That's sort of like the
quintessential part Parka thing.

1803
01:48:19,690 --> 01:48:23,760
I think those things are kind of dope.
The word park is kind of kind of iffy.

1804
01:48:24,020 --> 01:48:26,130
What are you talking about? I don't
know. I've never heard the word.

1805
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:29,530
I'm saying coming in fresh. You're
used to it, bro. You're from Hawaii.

1806
01:48:29,531 --> 01:48:33,240
How you to know where to park and not
even see snow until like three weeks ago

1807
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:37,970
or something. No, for real. You didn't
see snow until you were 30 right?

1808
01:48:37,971 --> 01:48:38,421
Or something.
I'm like,

1809
01:48:38,421 --> 01:48:42,930
well technically I saw snow on the big
island when I was a little kid one time.

1810
01:48:43,350 --> 01:48:47,070
And you go to the big island,
you go up and Monica and you can see snow.

1811
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:50,360
We went up there with shorts and a tank
top by the way, we just drove up there.

1812
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:54,950
But since then, yes I had not
seen snow until I was 30. Yes.

1813
01:48:55,380 --> 01:48:59,860
So there's no possible way you're
going to know what a park is. So yeah.

1814
01:48:59,861 --> 01:49:02,670
So which kind of is part of my
point where if you've never really,

1815
01:49:02,671 --> 01:49:03,900
I mean I've heard the word Parker but I,

1816
01:49:03,901 --> 01:49:08,520
I'm not used to what kind of entails
and the and what the goodness of that.

1817
01:49:08,521 --> 01:49:13,200
So I'm just left with the word Parka
and a park is as far as just the word

1818
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:17,920
doesn't seem like, uh, I dunno.
It seems like a funny word, Huh?

1819
01:49:18,330 --> 01:49:22,020
Well put some context around it.
Freezing cold people. Give them a Parka.

1820
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:26,140
Nice functional Parka.
Be able to live. Yup.

1821
01:49:26,810 --> 01:49:29,970
Man. I dig it growing,
you know, if growth,

1822
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:33,240
we call that grow up growing here
trying to, good speaking of growth,

1823
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:37,290
you want to stay on the path and represent
at the same time grow in that way.

1824
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,600
Go to Jocko store.com.
That's right.

1825
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:43,620
Chuck was this door where you can get
your discipline equals freedom shirts,

1826
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:49,930
women tank tops by way. Men,
tank tops, men's tank tops.

1827
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:51,790
I know the temperature is dropping.

1828
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:53,410
I'm not going to say it's
cold here in California.

1829
01:49:53,411 --> 01:49:58,210
I'm not gonna say that the
temperature is lowering. So I dig it.

1830
01:49:58,211 --> 01:50:00,760
If you're not going to wear the
tank top all the time, I dig it.

1831
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:04,450
But they're on there
nonetheless. Uh, some hoodies,

1832
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:09,340
either they're out now or they will
be within one week from right now.

1833
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:11,230
T shirts,
tee shirts,

1834
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:17,310
definitely see your presenting now stop.

1835
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:19,740
Good.
Cause it's Eh,

1836
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:23,080
I talked about like for me

1837
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:28,510
to make a statement with what you're
wearing is kind of just a little bit,

1838
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,990
I don't like that. It's too much.
I'm not dressing to make a statement.

1839
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:36,190
I don't think,
I'm not dressing you make statement.

1840
01:50:36,190 --> 01:50:40,300
I wear the functionality is
primary. Sure. So I don't know.

1841
01:50:40,301 --> 01:50:43,300
I felt it was shirt is functional,
right? It is functional,

1842
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:45,520
but it makes a subtle statement,
I must admit.

1843
01:50:45,550 --> 01:50:48,670
Well even when I was making the
statement is making a statement.

1844
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:50,510
It's kind of like, well, no.

1845
01:50:50,790 --> 01:50:53,480
If you try too hard to not make a
statement and that's just, yeah, yeah,

1846
01:50:53,500 --> 01:50:56,320
then you're, you're a bigger state of
feeding it. Yeah. Defeating the purpose.

1847
01:50:56,650 --> 01:51:01,390
That's why this this shirt subtle
statement made in mostly to yourself.

1848
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:03,760
Then on a statement to the world,
because people just look at this,

1849
01:51:03,761 --> 01:51:05,050
would not even think twice about it.

1850
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:08,680
Maybe they think one more time about
it and think, what does that, well,

1851
01:51:08,681 --> 01:51:10,570
if you're watching this on youtube,

1852
01:51:10,571 --> 01:51:13,120
they're going to notice that you're not
wearing the victory and that's going to

1853
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:16,330
be a huge statement and that's going to
actually maybe even throw some people

1854
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:20,530
for a little loop nonetheless. Yes.

1855
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:24,940
All on Jocko store.com some cool
rash guards on there as well.

1856
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:27,490
Some get out a little bit more.
How should I say?

1857
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:32,670
Geared towards the specific path
of kidding after the disaster,

1858
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:36,820
technically one that
literally says get after it.

1859
01:51:37,020 --> 01:51:40,570
I guess that's point a.
Subscribe to the podcast.

1860
01:51:40,571 --> 01:51:42,610
If you don't iTunes Google play stitcher,

1861
01:51:42,940 --> 01:51:47,530

and get a good laugh from the crazy

1862
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:52,180
things that you say. Thank you
all. So the warrior kid podcast,

1863
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:54,010
we just put out a new one.

1864
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:58,360
I apologize that they come a little
bit further apart than these. Uh,

1865
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:03,070
I've gotten many people that have said
they had been listening to the first 18

1866
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:05,980
warrior kid podcasts over
and over and over again.

1867
01:52:05,981 --> 01:52:10,981
So I'm glad there's are learning lessons
and I appreciate the feedback on those.

1868
01:52:11,381 --> 01:52:11,951
Also,
he'd go,

1869
01:52:11,951 --> 01:52:16,951
don't forget your warrior kid soap from
Irish oaks ranch.com young by made by

1870
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:22,380
young warrior kid Aiden
who's making Jocko soap.

1871
01:52:23,170 --> 01:52:25,780
And his advice,
which I totally agree with,

1872
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:31,180
is get some soap so you can
stay clean, dig it, Youtube.

1873
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:32,740
Don't forget about youtube.

1874
01:52:33,130 --> 01:52:37,480
Subscribe to the Youtube Channel so
you can see echoes, legit videos.

1875
01:52:37,660 --> 01:52:41,500
You can see if we have guests on, you can
see who they are, what they look like,

1876
01:52:41,530 --> 01:52:45,130
how they react,
all that stuff you can get a feel for.

1877
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:47,900
You can get to see what if you
don't know what Echo looks like,

1878
01:52:47,901 --> 01:52:49,970
he doesn't look like what he sounds like.

1879
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:54,920
So we've been told so you can see what
echo looks like and then you can put a

1880
01:52:54,921 --> 01:52:59,300
comment that says,
it can say for instance,

1881
01:52:59,600 --> 01:53:01,660
Echo look in Jack,

1882
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:07,730
sure or damn echoes Yo,
or whatever.

1883
01:53:07,790 --> 01:53:11,270
So there's a lot of those comments that
make it on there and I know that that

1884
01:53:11,630 --> 01:53:15,950
that's basically the form of compensation
that echo gets for his work is people

1885
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:20,951
telling people than Youtube comments
saying echoes got jacked guns.

1886
01:53:21,110 --> 01:53:25,820
So if you want, if you want to pay Echo
Charles, if you want to pay Echo Charles,

1887
01:53:26,060 --> 01:53:29,750
there's no patriotic count.
There's no go fund me.

1888
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:34,580
You just go onto youtube comments
and you right echo look and jack boy.

1889
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,820
Oh, so there you go. Clever.

1890
01:53:41,660 --> 01:53:43,790
Also psychological warfare.

1891
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:48,680
That's an album with tracks that
we made Jocko talking by the way,

1892
01:53:48,681 --> 01:53:51,320
telling you how to get past through,

1893
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:56,380
get through power through those
moments of weakness when they arise,

1894
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,540
which they do sometimes. By the way,
I know you didn't know this actually,

1895
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:01,640
you didn't know this,
but they do a rise.

1896
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,400
But if talk was there telling you
how to get through it pragmatically,

1897
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:06,470
by the way,
you'll get through it.

1898
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:09,290
I found that to be a fact a
hundred percent of the time.

1899
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:15,860
Also while you're doing your
workout and it gets boring going on

1900
01:54:15,861 --> 01:54:19,220
at.com/chocolate by the way,
and get new kettle bells,

1901
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:24,830
so what I did totally revives your
whole workout. In fact, do this,

1902
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:27,800
do your normal workout if in fact it
doesn't have kettle bells in the workout.

1903
01:54:27,801 --> 01:54:31,550
Dude, your normal workout and
do a kettlebell like maybe
like a five or 10 minute

1904
01:54:31,551 --> 01:54:32,060
ones.

1905
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:37,060
My son was asking me about working
out and he was kind of like,

1906
01:54:37,551 --> 01:54:38,570
well,
I just want to get like,

1907
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:45,100
look what big muscles just just get
strong and so I and he can do or has done

1908
01:54:47,211 --> 01:54:48,440
the Kettlebell,
snatch

1909
01:54:49,940 --> 01:54:53,180
up the weight a little bit and
throw that thing up there and it,

1910
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:55,860
I go every time you have to stop
that thing in the top position,

1911
01:54:55,861 --> 01:54:58,370
it's your whole body has to
kind of put some effort into it.

1912
01:54:58,610 --> 01:55:03,560
You will have if you haven't
done it before and you go
a little bit heavier than

1913
01:55:03,561 --> 01:55:06,830
like what you, which I don't, you know,
if it could be careful, blah blah blah,

1914
01:55:06,831 --> 01:55:08,990
whatever. Okay. So if you
go a little bit heavier,

1915
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:13,750
you will have like sor abs or the
next day your abs will be sorting.

1916
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,620
So your poster,
your chain sure will be some work.

1917
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:18,740
Are you going to say it like that?

1918
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:21,830
I know it's close to your posterior chain
because there's people like why don't

1919
01:55:21,831 --> 01:55:25,420
you want me to do, I can't, you know, so
your poster anterior chain will be uh,

1920
01:55:25,460 --> 01:55:29,960
get work. But believe it or
not, your front interior,

1921
01:55:30,210 --> 01:55:33,870
anterior chain, we'll get work
too because it has to arrest. Yes.

1922
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:38,030
That weight, which is flying up
there and then asked to stop.

1923
01:55:38,031 --> 01:55:40,190
Otherwise it rips your shoulder out,
which is why you should be careful.

1924
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:44,010
Don't go too heavy. And so
my, you know, my bicep is

1925
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,460
this healing. It's almost
there man. We're almost there.

1926
01:55:47,490 --> 01:55:51,960
But one of the things I could straight
up not even start doing until very

1927
01:55:51,961 --> 01:55:55,530
recently is kettle bells on that
site. You know, cause it flaps around,

1928
01:55:56,340 --> 01:56:00,330
twist it, twist your wrist in
this way that it really, it puts,

1929
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:04,650
so even when I go out on a light one,
and it's weird because the pain is less,

1930
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:09,651
they're more so than just kind of the
raw newness of my arm going through that

1931
01:56:09,961 --> 01:56:12,960
whole kettle bell procedure.
See what I'm saying? So like,

1932
01:56:12,961 --> 01:56:15,240
you know when the thing comes up
to a rest right here on your wrist,

1933
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:18,690
just it's sitting there on your wrist.
It has to rest there and your wrist,

1934
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:21,000
your wrist is twisted in a
certain way, you know, it's cool.

1935
01:56:21,001 --> 01:56:25,860
It's normal if you don't. But man, it's
weird. The difference of my right hand,

1936
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:29,610
my good hand and my bad hand. Just the
thing resting on the thing. It's like Ah,

1937
01:56:29,611 --> 01:56:33,330
you know how like do you have any,
so she lacked the conditioning. Yeah.

1938
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:38,040
Faded just in your little
own. Yeah. Yeah. Tunnel.

1939
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:39,890
The toughness of the email thing.

1940
01:56:39,990 --> 01:56:43,630
Yeah. Not that the other day when we
were rolling one, Oh that my toughness

1941
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:46,120
dissension of tough.

1942
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:50,820
Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. I
didn't see it. I'll stay. I
was taking it light, you know.

1943
01:56:50,821 --> 01:56:54,540
See what I'm saying? You really,
you're really happy with that.

1944
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:58,410
I'm just saying, Hey, don't
forget about Jocko white tea.

1945
01:56:59,580 --> 01:57:03,030
It is certified as the only beverage.

1946
01:57:03,090 --> 01:57:06,300
Whether you get it in the can are you
getting in the bag and you steep it

1947
01:57:06,301 --> 01:57:07,134
yourself.

1948
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:12,380
Either way it is the only beverage in
the world that comes with a 100% money

1949
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:16,170
back guarantee of an 8,000
pound dead lift. Good.

1950
01:57:16,380 --> 01:57:19,440
Which is really good and
it's organic by the way.

1951
01:57:19,900 --> 01:57:21,480
Panic on top of that.

1952
01:57:22,240 --> 01:57:27,240
Something so tasty and as the winter
arrives and it gets really cold.

1953
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:30,770
California,
sorry,

1954
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:35,280
my people of the north.
Do you get that warm tea going?

1955
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:39,060
Just put a couple of bags. Now some people
worry about how long you should steep.

1956
01:57:39,120 --> 01:57:41,580
Do you know what steep the tea
means? I do not yet. Okay. Yeah,

1957
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:46,470
so how long should you steep the tea
in my opinion, when I put a tea bag in,

1958
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:50,400
it's not coming out straight. I just
leave it in there. I'm just going to,

1959
01:57:50,401 --> 01:57:52,890
I'm going to leave it in there. It's,
it's good to go to drink and you know,

1960
01:57:52,891 --> 01:57:55,740
like a couple, like a
minute, maybe two minutes,

1961
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:59,550
but then I'm not taking that tea bag. I'm
going to get all that, all that Jocko,

1962
01:57:59,551 --> 01:58:02,700
White Tea, all that pomegranate,
goodness, all that, all,

1963
01:58:02,730 --> 01:58:07,730
all those antioxidants are coming right
into my system and it tastes delicious.

1964
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:11,940
And it does have caffeine in it.
I will say.

1965
01:58:12,450 --> 01:58:17,450
So the cans have 60 milligrams
depending on how long you steep.

1966
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:21,360
And I think when you steep it like I do,
there's probably a little bit extra,

1967
01:58:21,390 --> 01:58:25,350
a little bit of extra,
get some inside there.

1968
01:58:25,640 --> 01:58:30,600
Steve Gibbs also got some books. Okay.
Where the warrior kid and Mark's mission,

1969
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,070
those are two kids books.

1970
01:58:32,430 --> 01:58:37,380
But I promise you that Uncle
Jake has lessons for everyone.

1971
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,180
Yeah,

1972
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:40,970
I agree. And I'm one of
those people. And uh,

1973
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:44,830
so I think when you read that to
your kids, oh well in my case,

1974
01:58:44,831 --> 01:58:49,330
because my daughter is five, can't
quite read a book yet, so I'll read it.

1975
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:52,590
But I feel like I'm reading to myself too.
Like these are all things that I,

1976
01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:55,930
some that you forget. I think as an
adult you forget a lot of these lessons.

1977
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:58,930
You know, cause now you have a routine
as an adult, you have a routine.

1978
01:58:58,931 --> 01:59:02,530
Some of these lessons it feels like
they don't apply at first. You know,

1979
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:04,690
so you kind of forget them and got,
man,

1980
01:59:04,691 --> 01:59:06,340
I wish I could just
incorporate that little thing.

1981
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:11,350
One of the fundamental laws of combat is
simple and way the warrior kid is the,

1982
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:20,810
it's the life rules put forth in a very
simple way that a young child could

1983
01:59:21,970 --> 01:59:26,320
understand them. But what's
surprising is in that simplicity,

1984
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:29,980
it hits anyone solidly,

1985
01:59:30,640 --> 01:59:32,920
right between the eyes.

1986
01:59:34,190 --> 01:59:36,520
So that's way the warrior
kid and Mark's mission.

1987
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:40,900
You can get those also about the
discipline equals freedom field manual.

1988
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:44,590
That's another one that if you,
if you read or if you refer to,

1989
01:59:44,650 --> 01:59:49,540
it'll like remind you cause like,
okay, so man, I, I don't meditate.

1990
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:53,740
I don't like, you know, like for like,
okay, it's arguable. What would you do?

1991
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:56,340
Meditation, it's not,
it's not, it's not meant.

1992
01:59:56,770 --> 01:59:59,610
You know what they're talking about
when you said you meditate. So,

1993
02:00:01,420 --> 02:00:05,350
from what I understand,
if you meditate on certain things,

1994
02:00:05,351 --> 02:00:09,240
they help like incorporate it into your,
you know, your whole normal thought,

1995
02:00:09,241 --> 02:00:11,180
meditate or whatever,
he'll look over it.

1996
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:17,080
That's what I would start with right
away. But, and then you would need,

1997
02:00:17,140 --> 02:00:19,600
and this is just my
thought about meditation,

1998
02:00:19,720 --> 02:00:23,500
you would need less reminders
of certain things, you know,

1999
02:00:23,590 --> 02:00:27,310
like how to like detaches
for whatever reason.

2000
02:00:27,310 --> 02:00:31,670
When I understood the concept of detach
and the importance of it, that's,

2001
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:36,840
that's to me just kind of established
itself as like one of the most important

2002
02:00:37,990 --> 02:00:40,750
things that you can roll into your
life that will improve it right away.

2003
02:00:41,260 --> 02:00:44,560
Right then and there. But here's
the thing, just like you said,

2004
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:48,790
you got to notice when you got to detach,
you know it's not,

2005
02:00:48,930 --> 02:00:50,890
detaching isn't the
hard part is to notice,

2006
02:00:50,891 --> 02:00:54,280
you know like when it's time to
go and so for lack of better term,

2007
02:00:54,310 --> 02:00:57,510
you're forgetting to detach right now
because you're so distracted by all the

2008
02:00:57,640 --> 02:01:01,480
feel or whatever. So it's one of the
few menu, it was like a really good one.

2009
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:03,670
Select type men, if you
can refer to that, boom.

2010
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:06,550
And this goes for all the subjects in
there by the way. Like, so like every day,

2011
02:01:06,551 --> 02:01:10,390
even every other day, two,
three days, whatever. Just
refer back to it, man. It helps.

2012
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:11,710
It keeps it on your mind.

2013
02:01:11,711 --> 02:01:16,711
All these things only does people
post pictures of the field manual,

2014
02:01:17,690 --> 02:01:21,610
like one page or two pages.
And when I, whenever I,

2015
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:24,100
when someone posts a picture of that,
I actually read,

2016
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:27,670
I wrote the book but I still read this
section and say like, and, and it,

2017
02:01:28,060 --> 02:01:31,300
and I don't read it and go, oh, I
remember writing that. I actually go,

2018
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:35,330
I can do that better. I want to do that.
I need to focus. You know what I mean? So,

2019
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,010
and he was a good thing about
that word, overwhelmed, right?

2020
02:01:39,020 --> 02:01:42,350
That was the one that uh,
I don't even know who posted it at first,

2021
02:01:42,570 --> 02:01:46,870
but he was like on fraud posted
it and like JP, maybe g. Yeah,

2022
02:01:46,871 --> 02:01:51,050
like Andy Frisella. Yes. So
that was one where it's like,

2023
02:01:51,200 --> 02:01:54,350
you know why you don't, why people were
posting that? Because when they read it,

2024
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:57,520
when they go, they referred to it,
they're like, oh I clicked again, let me,

2025
02:01:57,521 --> 02:02:00,260
you know, cause that's kind of the whole
nature of posting things. So the boom,

2026
02:02:00,261 --> 02:02:03,470
that's exactly what's happening. So it was
like boom, I need to remember that one.

2027
02:02:03,471 --> 02:02:06,080
It's not like that's the first time they
read it. Maybe it is, maybe it's not.

2028
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:07,580
But most of the time it's like,
okay,

2029
02:02:07,581 --> 02:02:09,640
I referred back to that
and they get to repost it.

2030
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:14,460
So it's doing exactly what I'm saying.
It's reminding you and the,

2031
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:17,420
you know, certain ones apply to
you at certain times to, you know,

2032
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:20,480
so it's like good man. Just to
refer back to that. So what I do,

2033
02:02:21,030 --> 02:02:23,610
it will keep you on the path.
If you want the audio version,

2034
02:02:23,640 --> 02:02:28,260
it's not available on audible.com
it's available on iTunes,

2035
02:02:28,261 --> 02:02:31,860
Amazon music, Google
play, other MP3 platforms.

2036
02:02:32,010 --> 02:02:33,450
Also extreme ownership.

2037
02:02:34,620 --> 02:02:36,960
I already talked about extreme ownership
and the leadership principles that are

2038
02:02:37,020 --> 02:02:41,940
in that and I talk about them all the
time and explain them to people in every

2039
02:02:41,941 --> 02:02:46,260
different type of organization. That's
what everyone had echelon front does.

2040
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:48,360
Which is our leadership
consulting business,

2041
02:02:48,600 --> 02:02:53,490
which is me and Leif Babin and JP Denelle
and Dave Burke and Flint Cochran and

2042
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:56,730
Mike's Rally and Mike [inaudible].
That's what we do.

2043
02:02:56,731 --> 02:03:01,731
We talk about the fundamental principles
that are in that book that we brought

2044
02:03:01,981 --> 02:03:06,270
home from the battlefield and
that book extreme ownership.

2045
02:03:06,780 --> 02:03:10,980
After we got done writing that book and
taught that stuff, we wrote another book.

2046
02:03:11,580 --> 02:03:13,140
It's called the dichotomy of leadership,

2047
02:03:13,141 --> 02:03:15,990
which we also talked about a bunch
of that cause you can't talk about,

2048
02:03:16,410 --> 02:03:21,410
you can't talk about leading human
beings without talking about extreme

2049
02:03:21,571 --> 02:03:22,290
ownership.

2050
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:26,790
The fundamental principles
of the laws of combat and,

2051
02:03:26,820 --> 02:03:27,990
and then when you start
talking about that,

2052
02:03:27,991 --> 02:03:29,850
you've got to talk about
the dichotomy of leadership.

2053
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:34,470
So those two books are also available.

2054
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:39,330
And what I like seeing is
when I just saw one today,

2055
02:03:39,360 --> 02:03:43,830
guy had probably posted a picture of 30
copies of the dichotomy of leadership.

2056
02:03:43,831 --> 02:03:44,380
He's like,
yeah,

2057
02:03:44,380 --> 02:03:47,430
this is going to the whole team because
that's how you get everyone aligned.

2058
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:50,580
You make everyone see, oh, you know
what? I'm going to think of this way.

2059
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:54,090
Now some people go, oh, I don't
want to share the secrets.

2060
02:03:54,450 --> 02:03:57,690
They want to keep it for themselves. That
doesn't help you. You don't do better.

2061
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:59,790
You do better if you,

2062
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:04,320
if everyone understands the principles
that's going to make you do better as the

2063
02:04:04,321 --> 02:04:07,500
leader. And by the way, if you're out
there trying to do better for yourself,

2064
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:10,770
don't read the book.
Go and do something else.

2065
02:04:10,771 --> 02:04:14,310
Cause I don't even want you
around just for yourself.

2066
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:18,090
If you're just trying to look out for you,
the principles aren't for you.

2067
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:23,310
You won't understand them
properly. So, and yet,

2068
02:04:23,340 --> 02:04:28,080
if you want to win, the best
possible way to win, by the way,

2069
02:04:28,110 --> 02:04:31,680
isn't by looking out for yourself. It's
by looking out for the good of the team.

2070
02:04:31,681 --> 02:04:34,170
It's by looking out for the mission.
That's how you win.

2071
02:04:35,070 --> 02:04:36,810
And that's what these
books will help you do.

2072
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:41,100
So there's those Ashlyn front I already
talked about at leadership consultancy.

2073
02:04:41,160 --> 02:04:45,390
If you want us to come and work with
your company or come and speak to your

2074
02:04:45,391 --> 02:04:46,940
company,
go to Ashland,

2075
02:04:46,950 --> 02:04:51,750
front.com don't contact a speakers bureau.

2076
02:04:51,780 --> 02:04:56,780
Don't Google Jocko speaking because it
will be a random speaking agent that

2077
02:04:57,721 --> 02:05:01,740
you'll then have to work through.
Just contact us, our company, Ashland,

2078
02:05:01,741 --> 02:05:05,580
front.com

2079
02:05:06,660 --> 02:05:11,660

check extreme ownership.com those are

2080
02:05:14,461 --> 02:05:18,030
our leadership conferences
and all of them have sold out.

2081
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:20,790
Did I say some of them are sold out?
Nope.

2082
02:05:21,030 --> 02:05:25,530
All of them have sold out and they
are all going to continue to sell out.

2083
02:05:25,531 --> 02:05:28,320
So look for the details
when the opportunity,

2084
02:05:28,370 --> 02:05:31,740
when when we put the details out
and you want to come sign up,

2085
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:37,460
that's extreme or soap.com and then
Overwatch is our business where we are

2086

2087
02:05:44,370 --> 02:05:49,370
combat aviation leaders and placing them
into civilian organizations that need

2088
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:54,720
leadership experience
and trained leadership.

2089
02:05:55,410 --> 02:05:59,400

you'll figure out which way to go,

2091
