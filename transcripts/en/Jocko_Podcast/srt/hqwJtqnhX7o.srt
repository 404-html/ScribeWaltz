00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,020
This is Jocko podcast number
84 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,170
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening,

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,613
gentlemen.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,770
Your life expectancy from the day you
join your battalion will be precisely

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,604
three weeks.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,580
The Florid mustached major who addressed
us at the small reinforcement camp,

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:34,300
a few miles from bay,
you obviously had misplaced,

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,360
had a misplaced sense of humor or he
should have been sacked on second thought.

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,920
He definitely should have been sacked.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Not that any of the dozen infantry Sabol
turns took the slightest notice of what

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,100
to us with a ramblings of an old fool.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,100
He was probably no more than 40

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,550
the fourth battalion,

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,730
the Somerset Light Infantry was in one
29 brigade and was a prewar territorial

15
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:09,850
army battalion with close
links with Bristol and bath

16
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,660
in the United Kingdom till late June,

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,180
1944 it was a close knit unit which had
almost been decimated within a period of

18
00:01:22,941 --> 00:01:24,080
48 hours

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
on 5th of July three
officers and 62 other ranks.

20
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,450
We're required as reinforcements.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,930
Between the 14th and the 18th of July,

22
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,140
a further 12 officers of whom I was one
and 479 other ranks arrived and even

23
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:50,691
then the battalion was still below its
full strength of 36 officers and nearly

24
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,760
700 and CEO's and men.

25
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,880
This will give some idea of the appalling
level of infantry casualties which had

26
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:06,071
to be accepted in order to enlarge the
slender and vulnerable Normandy beach

27
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,374
head.

28
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,470
Because I had the had had previous
experience of six pounder anti tank guns.

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,680
The commanding officer lippy Lieutenant
Colonel Cg Lipscomb posted me as second

30
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:26,840
in command to the battalions anti tank
platoon, which consisted of six guns,

31
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:32,660
but my stay with the platoon were short
and I was quickly sucked into the real

32
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:37,661
infantry battle as commander of 18
platoon in d company on the 31st of July.

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,840
Immediately after the battle of brisk
Broussard d company had just lost their

34
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:50,261
commander Tim Braithwaite who lost a
foot and gained a military cross and 18

35
00:02:52,311 --> 00:02:54,740
platoon their commander.

36
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,040
So that right is the beginning

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,050
of a book that we're
going to look at today.

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,640
It's called 18 platoon.
It's written by a guy named Sydney,

39
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:13,030
Jerry j, a r, y,

40
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,390
who was born in Essex in 1924 joined
the army in 1942 as a private soldier in

41
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:23,200
1943 he was commissioned

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,330
and from 19 from July of 1944 until
June of 1945 he served as the platoon

43
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:36,850
commander for 18 platoon.
And

44
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,390
the chances of survival for an infantry
subaltern in a rifle company during the

45
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:48,150
campaign in northwest Europe were slim.

46
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,080
Most survived for only a few weeks.
Sydney,

47
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:56,520
Jerry survived 10 months from July,

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,520
1944 when he took command of 18 platoon
in Normandy until the end of the war,

49
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,500
near Bremen in early
May of 1945 so this guy,

50
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,400
this is, this is amazing,
this guy, Sydney Jerry,

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,630
he's the only platoon commander in the,

52
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:21,020
any British second army to survive as a
platoon commander from Normandy to the

53
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:26,880
German surrender. One Guy, one guy,

54
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,463
and this is the guy.

55
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,570
Okay,

56
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,400
it's,
it's amazing.

57
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,230
And you're going to see that
his attitude is, I mean, the,

58
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:41,640
the lessons that he learned, he was
young coming in. Who's 20 years old,

59
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,700
20 year old platoon commander
coming in inexperienced,

60
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,270
kind of lived a sheltered life. You've
got to check out some pictures of him.

61
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:52,410
He has that look to, it looks like
he looks like you don't sheltered.

62
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:54,500
It looks like a little
young whippersnapper. Sure.

63
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:01,380
So we'll go back to the book here as he
breaks down what a platoon was at this

64
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:06,330
time. In 1944 the war establishment of
a British infantry platoon was 36 men.

65
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,250
It consisted of three rifles,
sections, each of 10 men,
including a Brendan gunner,

66
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,340
each commanded by a corporal
or sometimes a lance sergeant.

67
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,290
There was also a small
platoon headquarters with a
two inch mortar detachment,

68
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,900
a PR,
which was an anti tank weapon.

69
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,810
The platoon sergeant and the commanders,
Batman slash runner

70
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,950
on July 31st 18 platoon
consisted of 17 all ranks,

71
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,700
12 of them are more recent reinforcements.

72
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:47,220
Halal one 12 and brick Krista
guard had claimed the rest.

73
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,720
So, so think about that. You're
supposed to have 36 people

74
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,300
in your platoon,

75
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,640
and they have 17 of which
12 our replacements,

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
which means that 29 people
had had been casualties.

77
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,390
There's seven people that had been
either killed or wounded, or sorry,

78
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:11,930
seven people out of this 36 that hadn't
been killed or wounded that remained in

79
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,930
the platoon right now.
So that's what we're talking about here.

80
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,310
And again,
he's coming in no combat experience.

81
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,290
He rolls in and going back to the book,

82
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,680
I sensed instantly that he
tight grip was required,

83
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,510
particularly so,

84
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,511
because those few who survived Hill
one 12 had witnessed what was without a

85
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:33,380
doubt,

86
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,970
the most horrific tragedy that befell
the battalion during the entire campaign.

87
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,000
So he's about to explain what they had
been through. He wasn't there for it,

88
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,730
but he knew and he had heard
what they had been through.

89
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,690
And I'm gonna say that again.

90
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,770
This is the most horrific
tragedy for the entire campaign.

91
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:55,350
This is what they're coming off of, and
this is who he's going to take over for.

92
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,230
This is what they had been
through back to the book during a,

93
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,490
during a company night attack and one of
our soldiers had been hit in the lower

94
00:07:02,491 --> 00:07:06,870
chest by a rifle or a machine gun,
bullet passing through his body.

95
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,430
It did not kill them outright.

96
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,070
Okay?

97
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,070
The bullets devilish course lay through
the soldiers webbing equipment pouch,

98
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,370
which contained a 77
phosphorous smoke grenade,

99
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,570
which exploded,

100
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,880
caught on barbed wire.

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,240
The poor soldier lay disemboweled for
all around to see his rising body,

102
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,120
uh,
smoking mass of burning phosphorus,

103
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,690
responding to his agonized screams
to put him out of his misery.

104
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,660
His platoon commander
shot him through the heart

105
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,290
and finally through the head after
the poor man's final frenzied, please

106
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,020
not there, sir. Through the head,

107
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:05,330
Doug proctor was witness to this
sublimely courageous incident,

108
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,180
which seared itself upon all our hearts.

109
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,123
Okay,

110
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,860
so that's what you're going to take
over for Jay. Can you do that? I mean,

111
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,640
is that like legal? You know, like
if they found out that that happened,

112
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,600
I have no idea what the
legal ramifications are.

113
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:31,380
But the moral weight on the shoulders
of the men that witnessed that is,

114
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,460
is unbelievably,
it's,

115
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,680
it's hard to imagine what that feels like.

116
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,840
Back to the book to the NCO Sergeant
Jim Kingston and Corporal Doug proctor

117
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:53,661
immediately reported to me and explained
forcefully and in great detail the poor

118
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:57,900
state of the platoon as they knew
it to be. So you've got these guys,

119
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,760
these are the senior
enlisted guys in the platoon,

120
00:08:59,761 --> 00:09:03,480
Jim Kingston and Doug proctor and you're
gonna hear a lot about them and they're

121
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,000
coming to him. Here's this
new guy checking in and
they're coming to them and,

122
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:10,500
and they're, you know, telling him how,
what, what a bad state the platoon is in.

123
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,583
Hmm.

124
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,330
Back to the book.
While they did.

125
00:09:13,331 --> 00:09:17,710
So I was conscious of being weighed up
was I fit to be their platoon commander.

126
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,870
They were responsible, anxious,
and discriminating owes,

127
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,140
that stands for non commissioned officer.
It's the senior enlisted guys.

128
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,530
And my apprenticeship
was to start immediately.

129
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:35,500
They were startled by my attire
previously warned by a young officer who'd

130
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:40,270
fought in Tunisia. That battle dress
was most unsuitable for Brat battle.

131
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,390
I'd come prepared in sand colored
corduroy trousers and a stout pullover.

132
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:47,890
Not on like that now
worn throughout the army.

133
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,140
Among my prejudices was an
acute dislike of steel helmets.

134
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,850
They gave me headaches on exercises and
England. I had been obliged to wear one,

135
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,330
but the surge of individualism,
which now engulfed me,

136
00:10:01,331 --> 00:10:05,020
convinced me that this was an article
of equipment best left out of battle.

137
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,390
Okay,

138
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:09,780
so he's, he shows up and he's
Kinda dressed out of uniform,

139
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,630
doesn't want to wear his helmet.
He's wearing corduroy pants.

140
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,310
Back to the book battle schools in
England had insisted that off infantry

141
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:21,510
officers should wear the same
equipment and dress as their soldiers.

142
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,860
The idea being that they could not be
then be so easily identified by enemy

143
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:30,390
snipers. They also decreed that one
should carry a rifle or a stun gun.

144
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,990
Clearly this was ridiculous.

145
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,680
How on Earth could your own soldiers
recognize you in the heat of battle if you

146
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:42,090
went through such lengths to disguise,
he had the same,

147
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,380
the same attitude as lieutenant lead and
Korea that was wearing the orange vest.

148
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:47,214
Do you remember that?

149
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,990
So he could be identified
in battle by his own men.

150
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,610
That's what this guy's attitude is like.

151
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,060
I'm not going to dress like everyone else.
They need to be.

152
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,060
They need to know who that I'm out there.

153
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,680
How can they need to be able to see me
back to the book I dispensed with a rifle

154
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:06,510
or sten gone too because I'm hopelessly
short sighted and I did not fancy trying

155
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:09,390
to command a platoon while
got up like a Christmas tree,

156
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,010
meaning covered and a bunch of gear
as a concession to impending battle.

157
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,390
I sported a 45 Colt automatic
pistol with two spare magazines,

158
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,610
the 38 Enfield revolver.

159
00:11:21,611 --> 00:11:24,820
Then general issue throughout the army
managed to combine total mechanical

160
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,920
reliability with complete ineffectiveness.

161
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Once fired six shots from one at a
target pinned to apply with board.

162
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,330
None of which even penetrated the board.
Neither did I hit the target,

163
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,160
which gave me a little
confidence in this weapon.

164
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,880
The nine pounds I paid for the
cult proved a sound investment.

165
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,060
So there's a lot of people that like to
talk about what type of side arm there.

166
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:53,950
You've got a big proponent for
the Colt 45 yeah. The classic,

167
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,620
again,

168
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,190
important to remember that he's not even
carrying a rifle because he knows his

169
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:02,620
job asleep.
And I used to do it when we had seals,

170
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,120
seal leaders that would spend
too much time on their gun.

171
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,620
I would say,
hey,

172
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:11,320
you know what they used to carry in the
Marine Corps and the army if you were a

173
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,060
leader, you know what they
carry? They carry a pistol.

174
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,500
Okay,

175
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,650
so give me your rifle and we take it from
him. Like you, you need to be leading,

176
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,370
not shooting.

177
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,203
Hmm.

178
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,020
Leif talks about that a lot.
Oh yeah. It's very, you know,

179
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:28,460
life talks about his mentality, which was
he wants to shoot. Yeah. He's from Texas.

180
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,450
You know, he's, he wants to shoot
his gun and he realized, Hey,

181
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm not here to shoot my gun.
Yeah. I'm here to, you know,

182
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:38,870
be at high pork and be off my gun
and leading. Yeah, that's my job.

183
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,080
And these guys took it to the point
where they're not even carrying a rifle.

184
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:46,360
Yeah. Now he's talking about a
senior leadership a little bit.

185
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,300
His enlisted leadership back to the book,
Jim Kingston was short,

186
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,960
quiet and shy with the shoe,
does have a countryman.

187
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,620
Although he had lived and
worked in Bristol all his life.

188
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,930
He barely raised his voice but had
total command over his section.

189
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,430
There was no argument with Jim that that's
another thing you'll find about this

190
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,780
book,
this book.

191
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,240
It takes so many stereotypes from,
from Sydney,

192
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,074
Jerry on down.

193
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,890
Like the stereotypes are just out the
window of the way this platoon was.

194
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,440
And there's a classic
example. You know, you've,

195
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,010
you picture the senior enlisted
guy, there's Bra, you know,
gunny highway scenario.

196
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,240
Not happening now he can now he talks
about Doug proctor back to the book.

197
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,500
Doug prop proctor.

198
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,730
Although a Summerset came
from Nottingham also short,

199
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,930
he was positive,

200
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:40,050
direct with unfailing common sense and
like Jim quietly dominated his section.

201
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,830
So there's another,
and I got to see some great leaders.

202
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,840
There's some guys that were in warranty,

203
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:51,980
you bruiser that were quiet when they
were in to your bruiser and when I was

204
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:55,880
putting them through their next
workup, I was thinking myself, hey,

205
00:13:55,881 --> 00:13:57,170
are they going to be
able to step up and lead?

206
00:13:57,171 --> 00:14:00,740
And that's exactly how they did it
right there. They were just like quiet,

207
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,830
professional and controlling,
but they run their mouth to get it done.

208
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,803
Hmm.

209
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,350
Back to the book, I had not previously
met any platoon like this one.

210
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,250
They were quiet,
fought ful,

211
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,850
and on abrasive soldiers there was
little swearing and there existed a

212
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:22,580
tranquility in their
relationships with one another.

213
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,850
Yeah.

214
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:26,940
Their eyes implored me not to fail them.

215
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,860
Two factors were immediately apparent.
Firstly,

216
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,910
the platoon required quiet
firm and confident leadership.

217
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,270
So that's a good assessment.

218
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,240
You can see these guys don't
need anybody yelling at them.

219
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:45,030
And here's the second point.
Secondly,

220
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:50,180
if I failed to use my imagination and
slavish Lee followed the battle school,

221
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,670
most of the platoon would not
survive another major battle.

222
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,130
So all the things he learned,

223
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:02,480
a standard typical stuff that he'd learned
that wasn't gonna work and it hadn't

224
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:07,070
worked. That's why they had so many
replacements come in back to the book.

225
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:07,880
In fact,

226
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,750
the problem that faced me with 18
platoon was identical to the one facing

227
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,180
General Montgomery,
our army group commander,

228
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:19,570
how to fight and defeat the cream of the
ss panzer divisions in the close normal

229
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,620
Normandy bull college and still retain
sufficient infantry rifleman to live and

230
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:29,020
fight tomorrow.
The problem was a difficult one.

231
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:33,370
Obviously I must set an example
and always lead from the front.

232
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,450
However,

233
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,220
if I became overeager and
got myself killed or wounded,

234
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,940
the whole object of my previous training
and my responsibility to my platoon

235
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,590
would be cast away. I would in
fact be letting down 18 platoon,

236
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,320
so he knows he's got to lead from
the front the time, same time.

237
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:53,500
He knows he's got to stay alive.
He knows you got to stay alive

238
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,770
and this Normandy fighting here,

239
00:15:56,771 --> 00:15:59,860
he talks about normally d
being a defender's paradise,

240
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:02,170
meaning when you're on
the defense and Normandy,

241
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,030
it's W it's a paradise for the people
on Defense, which was the Germans.

242
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,410
Back to the book. We fought from one
hedge row to the next up, torturous,

243
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,610
overgrown sunken lanes,
ideal country for the German defender,

244
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,570
but appalling for attacking infantry.
However,

245
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,430
no arm but infantry could take and hold
the Norman depot cottage bill conscious

246
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:28,480
like a trees.
Shrubs mangled together.

247
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,930
It was here that I served
my apprenticeship and
the platoon developed its

248
00:16:34,931 --> 00:16:35,441
character,

249
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:39,190
which despite constant depletion by
casualties over the coming 10 months,

250
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,140
it would retain until the end of the war.

251
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,550
It was also here that imperceptibly
I became possessive with 18 platoon.

252
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,460
It was mine to be guarded with an almost
maternal jealousy that resented all

253
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,530
criticism of my soldiers.

254
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,250
That's building at this point,

255
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,280
most important.

256
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,080
It was in the boat cottage
that I began to appreciate.

257
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:10,120
How vital is grip

258
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,310
grip on oneself,

259
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,720
grip on one soldiers and
grip on the situation.

260
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,680
Unlike characters in novels and films,

261
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,890
most men react nervously
to real battle conditions,

262
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,360
discipline and regimental pride,
our supports,

263
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,900
but indecisive moments of great danger.

264
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,250
The grip of the leader
on the led is paramount.

265
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,260
Infantry section,

266
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:45,940
platoon commanders must possess the
minds and hearts of their soldiers.

267
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:50,880
Strength of character is not enough
successful leadership in battle,

268
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:55,970
although complex any intangible always
seemed to me to depend on two factors.

269
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,740
Firstly, soldiers must have
confidence in their leaders,

270
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:03,180
professional ability.

271
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,990
And secondly they must trust them as men.

272
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,550
So there you go. They got to have
confidence in your ability and trust.

273
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,510
And this trust topic
comes up all the time.

274
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:21,430
And I use the word relationships
kind of interchangeably with trust.

275
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,630
I always have to remind myself to point
that out, that what I'm talking about,

276
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:29,020
relationships and building relationships
and business on the battlefield and

277
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,960
wife relationships, our trust,
that's what they are yet.

278
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,740
But we build a relationship
on trust. Yeah. And I guess
you could have, you know,

279
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,790
relationships that aren't built on trust
that those are like another thing. Oh,

280
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:43,680
I have a relationship with that guy.
But you know. Yeah. So, but that's not,

281
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,240
that's the one I'm talking about,
right? I'm a good relationships. Yeah.

282
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,680
Those are based on trust and
those are obviously the most,

283
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,780
the second most important thing to him.

284
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,230
So first is confidence in their
ability and second is trust.

285
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,650
I like this part. It helps too. If a
leader has the reputation of being lucky

286
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:08,680
field Marshall Montgomery place great
importance on the principle of making the

287
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,270
enemy dance to your tune.

288
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,800
Nowhere is this more important
than in platoon and company battle.

289
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,090
It is decisive because if
you do not dominate events,

290
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,500
your enemy will.

291
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,893
Okay.

292
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,070
There you go. That's Jujitsu right there.
Be First. Yeah. You gotta be first.

293
00:19:27,071 --> 00:19:30,910
You got to dictate the pace.
You gotta you gotta be proactive.

294
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:31,903
Hmm.

295
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,211
Back to the book.

296
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:40,211
Sound leadership like true love to which
I suspect it is closely related is all

297
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:42,344
powerful.

298
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,490
It can overcome the seemingly impossible
and it's effect on both leader and led

299
00:19:49,491 --> 00:19:51,020
is profound and lasting.

300
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,590
Even after the passage of 40 years.

301
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,680
Brief mention of the battalions
finest officers and NCRS brings.

302
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,690
It brings a smile to the faces
of the survivors of my platoon.

303
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,950
There resentment of those who failed to
lead when it mattered most still runs

304
00:20:09,381 --> 00:20:10,820
astonishing.
Lead deep.

305
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,400
Yeah.

306
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,330
So leadership can overcome
seemingly impossible.

307
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,140
This why leadership is the most
important thing on the battlefield.

308
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,173
Mm.

309
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,500
Now he's going into his,

310
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,430
so that's kind of his assessment
and this is based on his experience,

311
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:33,390
which we're about to get into. Then he's
does more assessments, there's more, more.

312
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,270
He talks more about what he learns
about leadership as a whole,

313
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,300
but you have to kind of understand what
he went through and figured out where he

314
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:44,160
learned it from the first,
his first command in battle.

315
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,570
Here we go back to the book,

316
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,720
we were to attack this hill from the
west with the fifth wheelchairs on our

317
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,890
right and the fourth
wheelchairs in reserves. The,

318
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,290
the approach march to our forming up
place had been a nightmare of swirling

319
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,670
abrasive dust shelling and the stench
of exhaust fumes from the tanks which

320
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,960
transported us forward.

321
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,370
Okay.

322
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,370
We were due to attack at 1500 hours with
a company leading on the right and be

323
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,510
company on the left.

324
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,550
We followed B company B Company moved
off quickly with our company deployed

325
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:21,670
about 300 yards behind their forward.

326
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:26,671
Platoons had barely crossed the stream
when concentrated Spandau fire came from

327
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:30,220
the front and from both flanks.
So spend Al Fire.

328
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:35,250
This is kind of a generic term that the
Brits used for German machine guns and

329
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:40,300
they're primarily talking about the MG
42 which is a big belt fed machine gun.

330
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,190
Very similar to a modern,
what we have m 60 or mark,

331
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:48,730
48 machine going a big heavy belts,
belt fed machine gun,

332
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:54,790
which lays down the insane
amounts of suppressive fire.

333
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,050
So here we go. They're getting hit from
both flanks with these machine guns.

334
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:03,190
Back to the book, there must've been
about 12 machine guns firing at one time.

335
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,130
This devastating display of firepower
stopped the battalion dead in its tracks.

336
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,810
There was no way forward or
around it and no way to retire.

337
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,910
Some of the guns had engaged d company
over the heads of B Company and private

338
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,010
Morrison 18 platoon was killed.

339
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,070
So there's his first guy lost.

340
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:30,050
I like this. The way he starts
off this next sentence here.

341
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,150
First word powerless.

342
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,593
Hmm.

343
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,700
So he's in his first combat situations,

344
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,440
got one man killed and how's
he feel powerless. Here we go.

345
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,750
Powerless and crouching and a hedge row.

346
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,330
I tried to identify the
spanned out positions.

347
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,720
This proved impossible
as they still kept up.

348
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:50,260
They're crushing display of firepower.
In my ignorance,

349
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:53,560
I expected that the enemy machine gunners
would soon expand their ammunition.

350
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,470
They did not, nor did they in
dozens of subsequent battles.

351
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,700
So he's waiting for them to stop shooting.
They don't. It just keeps coming.

352
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,110
Captain Scammell commanding a
company was severely wounded.

353
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,140
Major Thomas Commanding
be company was killed.

354
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,780
Their companies were badly
caught up on our right.

355
00:23:15,781 --> 00:23:20,490
The fifth wheelchairs had fared no better
with their CEO killed and casualties

356
00:23:20,491 --> 00:23:22,920
mounting their attack.
Also foundered.

357
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,233
Okay.

358
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,610
As the afternoon turn to evening shelling
and mortaring increased much of it

359
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,600
passing over our heads.

360
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:35,601
This isolating us from the
Reserve Battalion so that
the Germans are mortaring

361
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,970
over their head so that the reserve
battalion can't get to them.

362
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,490
Shortly before dark,
a troop of tanks arrived,

363
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,250
one of which able to cross the stream

364
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:50,600
and give us some brave close support.
Undoubtedly it increased our morale,

365
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,590
but it was not enough to get
the whole attack underway again.

366
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,870
Any movement by B Company to our front
brought down instant and concentrated

367
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,770
Spandau fire.

368
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,460
The same applied to us a few
hundred yards to their rear.

369
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,210
Fortunately, the enemy did not
seem to have any anti tank guns,

370
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,200
so our armored friends
were comparatively safe,

371
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,370
but the fact remained that
about 12 span dose had halted.

372
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,060
A battalion attack without
are locating even one of them.

373
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,480
That's what suppressive fire does.
That's what,

374
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,770
that's what a big machine gun does.
You've got 12 big machine guns.

375
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,500
This stopping 700 people from moving.

376
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,310
That's called suppressive fire.
That's why you don't,

377
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:40,360
when you heard Roger Hayden talk
about how how many heavy weapons they,

378
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:42,580
how many machine guns they'd carry.
They,

379
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,520
I think they had nine out of
a platoon of 14 that's why

380
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,950
as dusk fell,
a new plan was made.

381
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,240
C and d companies would advance in
single file through a and B companies and

382
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,510
using the cover of darkness,
darkness infiltrate the enemy position.

383
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,890
Once through them we would climb to the
top of the hill and consolidate a cold

384
00:25:02,891 --> 00:25:04,270
and damp miss descended,

385
00:25:04,271 --> 00:25:08,950
which with fading light gave us welcome
cover but also wretched discomfort.

386
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:13,300
We were still in shirt
sleeves which became damp from
the sweat of our exertion.

387
00:25:13,301 --> 00:25:17,560
Climbing the steep lower slopes
alert with pistol and hand.

388
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,100
I anticipated a sudden
brush with an enemy post.

389
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Not a shot was fired by some miracle.

390
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,820
We passed right through their positions
without being to deck detected our luck

391
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:30,654
and changed

392
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,060
so you're going to see quite a bit of
that is as they what the Germans were

393
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:40,990
doing at this point defending hard,
but then instead of staying in dying,

394
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:45,190
in most cases they would retreat and so
they'd fight really hard for awhile and

395
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:47,920
then retreat and they advance
if they had an opportunity.

396
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,980
But you're going to see a
lot of that back to the book.

397
00:25:50,981 --> 00:25:53,380
We now had to advance
across a large orchard,

398
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,670
so I deployed the platoon
with two sections up and
urged them forward as fast as

399
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:00,400
possible.
Suddenly in the middle of the orchard,

400
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,030
we came across a young girl in a clean
white dress sitting with her back to an

401
00:26:04,031 --> 00:26:05,230
apple tree sketching.

402
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,490
Now I just talked about
this at the mustard,

403
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,210
the random things that happened in combat
and this is what I'm talking about and

404
00:26:15,211 --> 00:26:17,100
how do you train for that?
How would you ever,

405
00:26:17,101 --> 00:26:19,590
if you're running a battle problem to
train people, what are you going to do?

406
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:22,170
Put a white girl in a white dress and
the sitting with her back to a tree

407
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:25,920
sketching doesn't make any sense. How
do you deal with it? Back to the book,

408
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:30,030
she seemed quite oblivious to the mortar
fire in 18 platoons warlike appearance,

409
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,110
how to stop pretty young
girls from interfering with
battle had not been part of

410
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,190
my training as an officer,

411
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:39,480
Cadet nor headed appeared on the
curriculum of any battle schools,

412
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:44,481
which without exception had despaired
of my as an infantry soldier.

413
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,123
Fortunately,

414
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,270
there was a farm house beside the
orchard and it had a cellar where she was

415
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:54,420
persuaded to shelter.
While we got on with our battle,

416
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,230
I reported what had occurred to our
company commander who told me that I was

417
00:26:58,231 --> 00:27:01,500
being quite ridiculous. Really,
Jerry, you're being absurd.

418
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,780
With that remark, I realized
that he had been a school master,

419
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,210
a breed with whom I had been in
conflict until quite recently,

420
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,260
a breed with whom I'd been in
conflict with until quite recently.

421
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,270
So this guy has the,
the attitude of a schoolmaster,

422
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,990
which in England is a little bit
different and especially in the 1930s and

423
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:29,040
forties you know the strict, I think of
a pink Floyd, you know the headmaster.

424
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,340
How can you have any pudding if
you don't eat? You meet that guy.

425
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,210
That's what he's comparing him to.
His next sarcastic remark,

426
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,990
I would be obliged, Jerry, if you
would kindly get on with the war.

427
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,560
He gave me a little indication of
what he wanted my platoon to do,

428
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,720
nor did it inspire confidence.

429
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,030
We were still over 200 yards from
the meadow surrounded by cornfields,

430
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,540
which was the company's objective.

431
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,580
And now became apparent that our company
commander had an academic and detached

432
00:27:56,581 --> 00:28:00,870
attitude of mind, which made it quite
impossible for him to come in the company.

433
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,410
So the company,
the company commander is not in the game.

434
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,380
There's one thing to be detached from
your emotions to make sure you're not

435
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:11,760
getting caught up in the
mayhem was another thing to
be so detached that you're

436
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:13,260
not even aware of what's going on.

437
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,440
And actually I had a name for this
when I was running training battlefield

438
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,320
aloofness is what I called it.
Cause we'd get these guys,

439
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,890
you get these guys and we'd be running
these crazy battlefield problems on them

440
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,800
and it'd be not to be crazy. And you'd
go, I remember one time there's a,

441
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,480
the the task unit commander,
there's all this mayhem going on.

442
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,620
The platoons are getting overrun and
the people are getting, you know,

443
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,350
shot with paint ball and they're
not hitting their objectives.

444
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,370
And I walk over to the company commander.
He's sitting in a Humvee, or sorry,

445
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,380
the the t you commander,
the troop commander.

446
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:48,210
He's sitting in a Humvee and I like the
windows up because they're bullet proof

447
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:50,340
windows, but he does want to get
shot with paypal. The windows up,

448
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:51,990
he's just sitting in there.
He's got his headset on.

449
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,530
I was radio like knock on
the door. I'm like, hey man,

450
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,620
you know what's going on out
there? He's like, well I'm,

451
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,050
I'm, I'm trying to gather that
information right now. And I'm like, Bro,

452
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,190
you ain't gonna gather
anything here but dust. Yeah,

453
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:11,490
you need to get out there and make
something happen. Because his idea was,

454
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:15,090
you know, I need to be detached, which I
talk about being detached all the time,

455
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,880
but there's a difference between
being and as you see the same thing in

456
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,040
businesses where the,
the,

457
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:24,030
the boss or the leader has no idea what's
happening on the ground floor. Right?

458
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,010
He doesn't know what the,
the workers are doing.

459
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,570
So he's so far to attach that he's,
he's, you know, let them eat cake. Right.

460
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,350
That's where that's where this guy is
that because what they just in a way just

461
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:39,480
depend on them to just
handle it on their own.

462
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:42,160
They think they're going to handle it on
their own, which a good attitude to have

463
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,430
until they can't handle it anymore.
Right, right. Once they can't, once a,

464
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:50,490
once a team or a platoon or a business
unit can't handle it on their own and

465
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:55,240
they're failing. You have to get, you have
to go do your job. You have to step up.

466
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,190
You have to step down as leader.

467
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:59,800
You have to get in there and
square that stuff away. Yeah. Yeah.

468
00:29:59,801 --> 00:30:04,540
So it's that without the get
there part, right. It's just like,

469
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,460
all right, call me when
it's done. And, and,

470
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:10,910
and the problem is somebody has got to
sort these problems out. Yeah. Yeah.

471
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,650
They're, they're, they're real.
Yeah. And they're not getting better.

472
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,230
And you might take you a minute to
go, okay, wait a second. This, these,

473
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,850
these problems aren't getting better.
What should I do?

474
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,470
Once you realize that
they're not getting better,

475
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,610
you've got to get in
there and make it happen.

476
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,793
Yeah.

477
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,140
This guy's not doing that.
Back to the book,

478
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:31,141
he'd be behaved like a supercilious
umpire on an exercise in England at any

479
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,371
moment.

480
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:37,220
I expected him to admonish me for bad
tactics and the school boy and me feared

481
00:30:37,221 --> 00:30:39,330
that I might be sent to the
headmaster for a beating.

482
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,100
So they continue on.

483
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,000
We seize the highest point which face
the enemy and the other platoons quickly

484
00:30:47,001 --> 00:30:52,001
deployed to give all around a fence of
the other flanks after being mortared.

485
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:56,330
The company required no encouragement
to dig in. It's a real motivator.

486
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,230
Getting mortared will make
you shovel hard and yeah,

487
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,060
the company commander walked
round the platoon positions,

488
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,370
eyeing everyone with distaste,

489
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,020
nothing pleased him and he suddenly
announced that he must sleep,

490
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,030
which he did in my slit trench.

491
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,030
Getting not a good feeling
about this company commander.

492
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,460
Just looking at everyone like

493
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:23,210
negatively and then all of
a sudden he wants to sleep.

494
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,950
I don't like this guy.
And of course he sleeps in in my trench.

495
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,630
Now this is good. There's another
officer that's there that's present,

496
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:37,640
a guardian angels watching over
us in the guise of Dennis Clark.

497
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:43,310
Dennis some years older than
me was exceptionally kind
to me and tolerant of my

498
00:31:43,311 --> 00:31:48,210
immaturity. Pay Attention.
This is good. He took my,

499
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,180
took me by the arm a few
paces away from my platoon.

500
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,230
Who the hell is in command
of this shambles? Sunny,

501
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,180
I muttered the unconvincing explanation
that it was our company commander

502
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,530
looking me straight in the eye.
He drew a deep breath,

503
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,510
which managed to express
both exasperations at my
explanation and sympathy with

504
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,344
my predicament.

505
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,980
You and I know that he is not.
So what are you going to do about it?

506
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:17,923
Okay.

507
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,650
I asked him if I should take command
his expression hardened. Yes.

508
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,180
You bloody well.
Should

509
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,430
some demonstration of loyalty to my
wretched company commander was obviously

510
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:31,120
required.

511
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,870
I blurted out that he was really a school
master and not a professional soldier,

512
00:32:34,871 --> 00:32:36,010
so he's kind of defending him.

513
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,210
Dennis put his arm around my
shoulder and whispered in my year,

514
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,050
so was eyes sunny,
so

515
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,570
that's awesome.

516
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,390
The company commander is not leading
and this this guy, Dennis Clark,

517
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:58,920
who I think he's, um,
artillery. Gunner pulls.

518
00:32:58,921 --> 00:33:03,870
This guy's a scientist, bro. You better
take charge of this. And you better do it.

519
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:07,620
Quick. Back to the book, we were
now, well dug in on our objective.

520
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,840
The company commander was still asleep.

521
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:13,110
Dennis was arranging
defensive fire tasks for me.

522
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:19,920
I hit assumed command of d company without
a word passes in between our company

523
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:24,450
commander in me in practice. It may
not the slightest difference because,

524
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,930
because like a bad
preparatory school master,

525
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,280
he saw his role as one of
examination and criticism.

526
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,760
Yeah.

527
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,930
This he continued to do despite
the incredulous stairs of the NCS.

528
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,620
So he's taking charge and and he hasn't
even said anything. He's just done it.

529
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:46,270
He just took charge and all the guy, the
guys continue to walk around, get stare,

530
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:51,190
glared everyone. But that doesn't
matter. So this is a classic example.

531
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,180
Your leaders not leading. I, I've
given this answer. It's so many times,

532
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:58,210
but this is a classic.
This might be one of the best examples.

533
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,160
Your leaders not leading. That's fine.
Good step up and lead yourself. Hmm.

534
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,683
Okay.

535
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,660
Back to the book by Don.

536
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:09,260
The enemy had retired and elements of the
battalion moved forward to consolidate

537
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:13,760
and strength and d companies position.
The whole operation was very amateur.

538
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,800
There was no doubt that the new company
commander could not command a company in

539
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:19,460
battle,

540
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:23,720
nor could I who is just beginning to
master the rudiments of commanding couple

541
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,360
tune.
He was removed within a few hours.

542
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,760
I think Dennis had
something to do with it,

543
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,310
but he was not the kind of man to
confide in 20 year old sub alternates.

544
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,580
So that's another classic thing
right there is that this Guy Dennis,

545
00:34:37,581 --> 00:34:41,830
who was another uh,
officer probably went and said,

546
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,940
get this Guy Outta here,
get this company commander out of here.

547
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,570
But when he does it,
the company commander gets removed and,

548
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,380
and he doesn't say anything to
Sydney. Jerry, he doesn't, you know,

549
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:53,930
ratted out or brag about
or make a big deal.

550
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,210
He doesn't say anything just happens.

551
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,710
It's like when I had a mutiny and my
platoon and the commanding officer's like,

552
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,720
no, we're not firing anyone.
You guys get Outta here.

553
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,590
Shut your mouse and go back to work. And
we were like, okay. And then a few days,

554
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:10,780
like a week later he got fired, but we,
it wasn't because of us as far as we know.

555
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:15,400
Right. Like no one's anything.
We just knew he got fired.
Yeah. Well, what reason?

556
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,580
We knew we had something to do with it,
but same thing.

557
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:24,500
So you don't need to create
a distrust in disloyalty and,

558
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,910
and not even just those words, but you
don't need to create drama. Yeah. Right.

559
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:29,980
Don't treat the drama.
Yeah.

560
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,150
That guy's going to going somewhere is
getting built it somewhere else. Hey,

561
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,710
you guys won everybody. Yeah. Yeah. We're
not doing that. We're not doing that.

562
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,100
We're not up our own ego

563
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,510
by disparaging someone else's. Let's worry
about the whole team. How's that sound?

564
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,800
Sounds like a good idea to me.
Back to the book,

565
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:50,100
I now have little doubt that for
the first two months in Normandy,

566
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,270
we lack two things.

567
00:35:51,271 --> 00:35:55,530
Comprehensive and imaginative training
and personal experience of battle.

568
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,250
We were all so seriously
handicapped by our casual attitude.

569
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Too many junior officers did not think
for themselves and persistently relied on

570
00:36:05,101 --> 00:36:10,101
the narrow teaching of battle schools
whose dogma had assumed the proportion of

571
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:12,600
holy writ.
So whatever he was taught,

572
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,960
he was taught that that's the
only way you can ever do it.

573
00:36:15,961 --> 00:36:19,530
And these guys that I've talked about
this many times on the, on the podcast,

574
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,150
the goal when I was running training was
to actually get the people to think it

575
00:36:24,151 --> 00:36:27,960
wasn't sure. You have to establish the
baseline standard operating procedures.

576
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,260
That's great and those
need to be rock solid.

577
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,390
But once those things are established,

578
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,510
you need to make people understand that
you don't always follow them and you

579
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:41,760
need to call off a piece of that standard
operating procedure to insert some

580
00:36:41,761 --> 00:36:44,310
other thing and bring in another per
standard operating procedure and mix and

581
00:36:44,311 --> 00:36:45,960
match them so that you get
something that's effective.

582
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,140
You need to think that's what a leader
needs to do at leader needs to think back

583
00:36:51,151 --> 00:36:51,520
to the book.

584
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,350
The British infantry platoons and
companies were overtrained and bored stiff

585
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:58,440
with basic infantry tactics, which
as far as they went, we're good.

586
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:01,620
Much of this training unfortunately
had been in the hands of battle school

587
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:06,621
instructors who themselves lacked
battle experience and imagination.

588
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,380
These tended to become pedagogues,

589
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,560
disciples of ds directing staff solution
about which no argument could be

590
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:20,220
tolerated. So DSS is that he'd
be, he mentioned it a bunch.

591
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,060
It's like that's their
solution. The directing staff,
you can't argue with them.

592
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:28,530
They're the, they're the
cadre. Yeah. Possibly.

593
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,660
Like most of our entry infantry,

594
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,500
they suffered some consequences of
the prewar shortage of creativity.

595
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,520
Intelligent regimental officers,
too.

596
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,520
Few of them were professionally
dedicated to the extent that they could

597
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:45,720
visualize how battles will be fought and
identify the problems that might arise

598
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,554
when planning them.

599
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,660
They seem to lack the capacity to think
relentlessly through these things until

600
00:37:51,661 --> 00:37:52,710
solutions were found.

601
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,530
Much of their time had been spent
policing the British empire. Also,

602
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,910
unlike the Germans,

603
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:04,080
we British instinctively
avoid displays of keenness.

604
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,090
The enthusiast, particularly if he
is innovative, isn't embarrassment.

605
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Thus the battlefield became our teacher
and inevitably it exacted a grim price

606
00:38:16,681 --> 00:38:18,510
in blood and time.

607
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,260
So as you're training,
you got to push yourself hard.

608
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:29,580
You've got to put yourself in situations.
I don't care what you're training for.

609
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,090
I don't care if you're training for
combat in a seal platoon, in an army,

610
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:34,170
infantry platoon,

611
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,950
or if in the business world and
you're training your leaders to handle

612
00:38:38,951 --> 00:38:42,550
situations or you're training
your customer service
reps to handle situations,

613
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,690
no matter which one of those you're in,
you need to push people hard.

614
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,630
You need to put them in
worst case scenario so that
they need to learn how they

615
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:52,240
need to learn how to think
to get out of those problems.

616
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,153
Okay.

617
00:38:55,490 --> 00:39:00,490
I recall with embarrassment and incident
at 45th infantry divisional battle

618
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:06,320
school during the spring of 1944 and
exceptionally tall and good natured

619
00:39:06,321 --> 00:39:09,860
Canadian officer had been sent to the
school to give a talk on the street

620
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:13,640
fighting. He had experienced
natally. It was an interesting talk,

621
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:17,810
but some of his advice ran contrary
to that being taught in the school.

622
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,180
Okay.

623
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,440
When the lecture was over,

624
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,310
the chief instructor with
insulting condensation,

625
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:29,460
thank this shy and kindly man for a
vivid word picture and turning to the

626
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:35,011
student's warned us that at as this
officer's experience was probably unusual.

627
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:39,880
We had best not stray
from the DAS solution.

628
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:41,770
Okay.

629
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,150
As taught at that school.

630
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,220
So you've got to combat veteran coming
back with experience from street fighting

631
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,054
in Italy.

632
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,700
Okay.

633
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,260
And he'd come back with some different
tactics and they tell him that you don't

634
00:39:55,261 --> 00:39:57,450
listen to that guy.
That's just a rare case.

635
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,500
Closed mind will get you killed.

636
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,153
Yeah.

637
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,900
This is starting to talk
about their overall sort of
formulation of combat plans

638
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:13,510
and how they operated.
Back to the book.

639
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,250
The most successful actions by 18 platoon
were fought without the support of

640
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,930
artillery or armor.

641
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:25,540
We had learned in a hard school
how to skirmish, infiltrate,

642
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:29,750
and edge our way forward,
the right or left flanking platoon attack.

643
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:34,240
So beloved of the battle school staff
would rarely succeed in the Normandy

644
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,200
bocage.

645
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:41,080
I remember with horror being locked
into timetables of meticulously planned

646
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:45,370
large battles, these invariably
left the junior infantry commander,

647
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:49,780
no scope for exploitation.
If you found a gap in the enemy defenses,

648
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,440
adherence to artillery program,
which rarely could be altered,

649
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:56,260
effectively stopped any
personal initiative.

650
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,450
So what that's saying is you have these,

651
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,460
the artillery that's going to drop bombs,

652
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:04,570
they're going to bomb or strike with
artillery at certain regions and certain

653
00:41:04,571 --> 00:41:06,340
times.
So Lee,

654
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:09,610
you might see the enemy running away
and you have a chance to gain a superior

655
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:10,444
tactical position,

656
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,650
but you can't because you know that
that's where the bombs are going.

657
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,770
That's where the artillery is gonna
be hitting in the next 12 minutes.

658
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,600
So you can't go.
So now you sit and wait.

659
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,990
So he got locked in by that
back to the book. To me,

660
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:25,040
the preparations for these battles assumed
the demented proportion of a Koffka

661
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:30,041
liked nightmare ballet in
which the anonymous they
ordained that we must perform

662
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:33,830
a choreographed at ritual dance.

663
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:37,610
Mccobb I felt trapped and helpless.

664
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,240
No Solo parts were written into the score,

665
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,130
nor was there scope for small groups
of performers and this man of ballet of

666
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:51,131
machines undoubtedly far shadows from the
psalm that the battle of Somme clouded

667
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:53,450
my emotions.

668
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:58,220
But instinct told me that this kind
of show would be unlikely to succeed.

669
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:02,720
The irony was that this support was
planned and given to the infantry.

670
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,490
Would the best of intentions.

671
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,590
The Psalm had cast its shadows on our
artillery and armored commanders both

672
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:13,640
genuinely believed that their hands,
they,

673
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:17,990
that in their hands they had the
panacea which would protect us,

674
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:23,050
the infantry from the terrible slaughter
of 1916 instead they put us in a

675
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:26,840
straight jacket. So very
interesting viewpoint. And,

676
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:30,590
and it's something that we need
to pay attention to because

677
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,450
you've got to be flexible.

678
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:38,560
You gotta be flexible and that's exactly
what he's talking about. And these,

679
00:42:38,561 --> 00:42:41,920
they would make these plans that were
so comprehensive and there was no,

680
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:43,630
you weren't allowed to
deviate from the plants.

681
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,450
And when you're not allowed to deviate
from the plans and it's something starts

682
00:42:46,451 --> 00:42:48,850
going differently than what you expected,
you're trapped.

683
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,340
Yeah.
Telephone

684
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,001
back to the book,

685
00:42:55,001 --> 00:43:00,001
far too much time had been spent fitting
the infantry and armor junior leaders

686
00:43:00,401 --> 00:43:05,230
into the big picture and too little
time spent training them and stimulating

687
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:10,231
their imagination and initiative and
individual resourcefulness to probe,

688
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,060
draw conclusions, infiltrate and exploit
weaknesses in the enemy's dispositions.

689
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,170
So He's,
he's criticizing this lack of initiative,

690
00:43:20,171 --> 00:43:23,260
lack of creativity and the training
to get that initiative and creativity

691
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,960
back to the book after the 1st of August,
18 platoon never failed in any attack.

692
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,040
Sometimes we took a little
longer than planned,

693
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,880
but we always got there
in the end in defense,

694
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,370
we never lost one yard of ground,

695
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:42,790
nor did the enemy ever
penetrate our platoon position.

696
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,390
And we always dominated no
man's land with our patrols.

697
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,590
Whether persistent patrolling
is always sound policy,

698
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,450
I will argue elsewhere.

699
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:54,250
Okay,

700
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:58,090
so he's saying once he kind of figured
it out, they didn't lose any more.

701
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:00,550
They didn't lose any attacks and
they didn't give up any ground.

702
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,990
It talks about the armor.
Our armor was accused of being tiger shy,

703
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:07,510
meaning scared of the Tiger
tanks and the Germans.

704
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:12,690
And I don't wonder why the devastation
caused by a single hit of an 88

705
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:17,770
millimeter armor piercing shell
needed to be seen to be believed.

706
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,630
And this is an overall statement
for the infantry and armor,

707
00:44:23,631 --> 00:44:24,740
the British Second Army,

708
00:44:24,741 --> 00:44:29,540
the sheer ferocity of the fighting
in Normandy came as a salad tour.

709
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,630
Solitary shock for which they
were in some ways unprepared.

710
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:37,770
So it was devastating for these guys.

711
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,050
Now we start pushing out out of uh,

712
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,740
out of normality and pushing into the CNE.

713
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,650
Okay,

714
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,580
and here we go. They're
pushing in the next day, 28,

715
00:44:52,581 --> 00:44:54,960
August d company occupied a Hara court.

716
00:44:55,490 --> 00:45:00,230
This is the only operation of war that
I ever known to go precisely as planned,

717
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,850
are supporting field regiment softened
up the objective with their 25 pounders,

718
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,900
the company advanced over Open Farm
Land and immaculate formation and

719
00:45:08,901 --> 00:45:10,610
consolidated exactly on time.

720
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,510
The only thing lacking was an enemy

721
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,950
total bag,
one days to German,

722
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,480
one dead German and one dead hair rabbit.
Right.

723
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:27,770
So the only one that ever went well was
when there was no enemy to fight against.

724
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,320
There was, there was two
Germans, one of them was dead,

725
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,470
the other one was dazed
and that was their,

726
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,380
their last battle in France.

727
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,390
Back to the book experience in Normandy
had removed anxieties regarding

728
00:45:44,881 --> 00:45:47,820
commanding and under strength platoon.
So he hasn't had enough man.

729
00:45:47,821 --> 00:45:52,050
He's supposed to have 36, he's had
like 17, 18, 19. In the attack,

730
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,040
particularly at night.

731
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,920
Apple tune at full strength is
just too big to maneuver quickly.

732
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:02,180
Three rifle sections of about 20 above
about seven men each plus headquarters

733
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:06,810
was ideal in defense. It was a different
matter. The more riflemen on the ground,

734
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:11,811
the better or short stay in lamence Sal
Milan gave me time to think the first

735
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:20,880
opportunity to do so since I
took command of 18 platoon.

736
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,450
It also gave me time to meet and talk with
other young officers in the battalion.

737
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:29,820
It was then that I realized that
18 platoon was no ordinary platoon.

738
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,890
It had some undefinable magic,
no corals,

739
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:39,360
little swearing. Despite the war.
That was the, despite the war,

740
00:46:39,361 --> 00:46:40,800
there was something peaceful about it.

741
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:44,910
A helping hand was always
available for anybody.

742
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,870
The emotional links were from and true.

743
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:52,200
I was a happy man,

744
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,950
so he realizes and once he starts
talking to the other platoon commanders,

745
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,450
he's got this really special platoon
that gets along great and he's,

746
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:03,810
he realizes it
back to the book.

747
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:08,790
No young officer can command a platoon
in battle on his own. In Normandy.

748
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:13,791
I'd seen platoon commanders served by
poor NCO struggling to gain some semblance

749
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:17,460
of control over their
bewildered and frightened men.

750
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:23,930
I'd also seen platoons with good end
CEOs go to pieces in the hands of an

751
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:27,680
indifferent officer,
Jim Kingston,

752
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,890
Doug proctor and Owen Cheesman set
this standard and tone for 18 platoon.

753
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:35,943
Without them,

754
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:40,120
I as the platoon commander would have
joined the ranks of so many poor young

755
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:42,970
officers who never achieved grip.

756
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,230
Okay.

757
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,740
Now
going to

758
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:56,950
another and he's putting together
another plan as they're advancing it,

759
00:47:56,951 --> 00:48:01,930
and obviously this is a long book.
I'm doing an abridged version,

760
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,130
hitting some highlights. You should
get the book. I obviously get the book,

761
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,053
buy the book

762
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:13,450
back to the book at Zero 400 hours
on 24th of September. Douglas,

763
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,510
this is the new company commander Douglas
Douglas held along Oh group by candle

764
00:48:19,151 --> 00:48:23,260
light in the cellar of the farmhouse at w,
which much to his annoyance,

765
00:48:23,261 --> 00:48:24,190
I kept falling asleep.

766
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:30,340
We were ordered to advance
straight eastward down a
narrow country lane from the

767
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:35,341
orchard to the main road and consolidate
after the Oh group and [inaudible]

768
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:37,270
group is what they call it.
Like when they're,

769
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:40,360
when they're officers get together and
pass the word and they called Oh group.

770
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:41,771
After the o group,

771
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:45,460
I made myself unpopular by asking
why were advancing towards an area of

772
00:48:45,461 --> 00:48:50,461
considerable German opposition when my
patrol had found a better route by which

773
00:48:50,621 --> 00:48:55,530
we might outflank the enemy. So
that, so he's saying, Hey, wait, why?

774
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:56,491
Cause at his Pulitzer,

775
00:48:56,491 --> 00:48:59,700
all his platoon had been out on a
patrol and found a better route and he's

776
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:03,860
asking why and he kind of gets shut down.

777
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,940
I was just 20 years old at the time.

778
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:11,070
And even then I knew I was incapable of
disputing orders without giving offense.

779
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,070
We started at zero 600 hours, two platoons
leading on either side of the track,

780
00:49:17,071 --> 00:49:20,880
the third falling in single file down
the track itself on either side where the

781
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:22,920
small holdings were small holdings,

782
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:28,020
a few allotments and bungalows
surrounded by small picket fences.

783
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,060
But platoons advanced through the gardens
and vegetable patches and passed on

784
00:49:33,061 --> 00:49:37,140
either side of the bungalows, the rear
section searching each one quickly

785
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:41,470
and while they're searching,
these little bungalows is there on patrol.

786
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,280
They find this back to the book
during one of these hurried searches,

787
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:50,080
one section found a Dutch family,
the Wittich's father,

788
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,700
mother, son and daughter,
riddled by Schmidt's or fire.

789
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,830
That's a German machine gun.

790
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:02,640
They lay an awkward postures of Def amid
their ransacked home visit from the SS.

791
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,150
No tears came,

792
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,580
nor did they come a half an hour later
when we came upon the charred wreckage of

793
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:13,720
an American Dakota,

794
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,940
it had carried us parachute troops to
the 82nd airborne division and they're

795
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:23,890
torn and burnt bodies littered the orchard
like charred and mutilated rag dolls.

796
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,490
Okay.

797
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,010
There was a further irony

798
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
attached to the front window and what
remained of the Dakotas cockpit was a tiny

799
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:36,440
teddy bear untouched by flames

800
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,560
two months before a lonely teddy bear
and an impersonal pool of blood had

801
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:43,920
brought forth tears.

802
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,990
Now I was collected and objective when
faced within the span of 30 minutes with

803
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:54,650
an atrocious murder and
mass carnage by fire.

804
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,650
And he's referring there in
the beginning of the book,

805
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:59,240
one of his first experiences,

806
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,900
he's by a slit trench and there's a dead
guy soldier in it and there's a little

807
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,090
teddy bear. And, and for some
reason, you know, he's young,

808
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:14,090
he's inexperienced and it gets,
gets, makes him super emotional.

809
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:18,720
He starts crying and, and
now he's a little further in
the war. He sees, you know,

810
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:23,770
this horrible murdered
family and these tragically,

811
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:24,710
you know,

812
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,710
burned and killed paratroopers and he's
able to detach emotionally from it.

813
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:34,860
Back to the book,

814
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:39,190
the enemy decided to make life
unpleasant for us as possible by sudden

815
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,040
unpredictable concentrations
of heavy artillery.

816
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:46,450
Right in the middle of our company area.
We called them stocks.

817
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,880
So he's going to use that word.
It just means we're getting bombed.

818
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:54,490
One of these shells unfortunately
fell right into one of 16 platoon slit

819
00:51:54,491 --> 00:51:55,324
trenches.

820
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,790
No trace remained of the two
men that were manning in it.

821
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:03,910
Manning a Bren in my platoon,

822
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:08,560
Lance Corporal Jack Lee and private Peter,
filmer or buried in the trench.

823
00:52:08,561 --> 00:52:13,120
They shared other members of their
section quickly dug them out unharmed,

824
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,850
very dirty and remarkably cheerful.

825
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,790
The self propelled guns,
increase their activities,

826
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,480
filling the sky above the company
with ugly black air bursts.

827
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,150
Yeah,

828
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:31,800
they could place these with uncanny
accuracy to burst about 25 feet above the

829
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:34,020
road junction,
outside company headquarters,

830
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:40,190
the casualties mounted company Sergeant
Major Sammy Jones and spot Martin.

831
00:52:41,071 --> 00:52:44,610
The jeep Burke driver were
both hit outside company HQ.

832
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,920
It was Sammy Jones who committed
the battalion's only atrocity.

833
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,360
Late one summer evening as the shadows
from high trees and hedges fell across a

834
00:52:57,241 --> 00:52:58,680
small field and Normandy.

835
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,640
We took some young Waffen Salt
Waffen SS soldiers prisoner.

836
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,450
One of them are short, stocky, and fair.

837
00:53:06,451 --> 00:53:11,451
Youth of about 18 proved insultingly
truculent seizing the young lout by the

838
00:53:13,801 --> 00:53:18,210
scruff of his neck. Samari roared. You
can take that Glenn out of your eyes,

839
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:21,930
my boy, and putting the
wretched youth across his knees.

840
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,960
He gave his backside a sound wacky

841
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:32,370
that is legit. And that's
again, uh, you know, Sydney.

842
00:53:32,371 --> 00:53:35,970
Jerry and he talks about how
proud he is that his men,

843
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,040
it's men's behavior is so
upstanding throughout this
whole miserable experience.

844
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:49,230
And even when they see atrocities
committed, like by the SS,

845
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,960
they still maintain their discipline
and their character. And this is,

846
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,520
this is what he does. Oh,
you, you're a little punk kid.

847
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,050
I'm going to spank you.

848
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,380
You tough little SS soldier can
put over the knee and spanked.

849
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:12,810
So after the attack, so
now there's, this is again,

850
00:54:12,811 --> 00:54:16,560
this is happening after one of
these attacks and, and the whole,

851
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:21,390
the whole basic premise of
this book is attack, rest,

852
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:24,870
attack, rest, attack,
rest. So as I'm reading,

853
00:54:24,871 --> 00:54:27,780
I'm kind of picking out some of the
attacks that they're going on and they're

854
00:54:27,781 --> 00:54:30,570
just moving through France and then
through Germany. That's what it is.

855
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,440
I should have explained that earlier.
Uh, but this is after one of the attacks.

856
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,460
It's interesting.
He says this smiling faces vanished.

857
00:54:38,461 --> 00:54:42,690
And the gray look returned once
more men walked with one ear,

858
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:46,920
cocked in the air for approaching
shells and with a slight stoop.

859
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,610
If you remember what I remember I was
talking about JP and I was talking about

860
00:54:50,611 --> 00:54:54,690
how like you'd see guys, they have
this natural little stoop. Yeah, yeah.

861
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:59,690
That's what he's talking about.
And Jp didn't happen. No stoop.

862
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,450
Jp standing up like you stupid.
He was not. Yeah, he was stupid.

863
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:09,210
He you standing up ready to get some.
But these guys as an,

864
00:55:09,211 --> 00:55:13,770
it's contrast because when they're on
the attack, they go into like JP mode.

865
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,720
They're standing up straight,
the ready to get some,

866
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,420
but then once they're on the defense
and they're just waiting to get shelled,

867
00:55:18,421 --> 00:55:21,000
they start to stoop.
They started crouch a little bit.

868
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:25,890
He continues back to the book. The jokes
began to Peter out and the cheerful,

869
00:55:25,891 --> 00:55:30,330
good morning sir ceased when I went
around the platoons at stand too.

870
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,660
Morale was always hired during an attack,

871
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,090
sitting around and being shelled is
not an occupation to be recommended.

872
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,150
So there's a good lesson there.

873
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,380
If do you or your team is
being defensive about things,

874
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,960
your morale is going to go down
because you're waiting to get hit.

875
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:55,450
So go out and hit somebody, you know,
go on the attack. Don't wait around.

876
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,400
Don't let your morale drown.

877
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,473
Hmm.

878
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:08,050
Here's another attack. Back to the
book. Scrambling out of the Colbert,

879
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,270
we set a fast pace up the side of
the road to a company's positions.

880
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,600
This immediately brought
small arms fire down on us,

881
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:20,010
but by then we were then 200 yards
of their slit trenches. So on.

882
00:56:20,011 --> 00:56:24,130
We ran as fast as we could being soaked.
I began

883
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:27,880
to steam my boots,
squelched and seem to drag me back,

884
00:56:27,881 --> 00:56:31,540
calling it my feet as it a bad dream and
stopping me from reaching the inviting

885
00:56:31,541 --> 00:56:33,100
cover of the slit trenches.

886
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:37,770
A company was dug in with two platoons
forward in an orchard face to face with

887
00:56:37,771 --> 00:56:40,690
the enemy who were in dykes
only a few yards beyond.

888
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,700
The third platoon was to the right rear
protecting the open flank and company

889
00:56:45,701 --> 00:56:49,360
headquarters to the left rear
centered on some farm buildings.

890
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:56,250
It was to these farm buildings that we
ran hurling ourselves onto the straw on

891
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:02,440
the barn floor.
We lay panting and gasping for breath.

892
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,960
John a cock, a company commander
appeared round the door of the barn.

893
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:13,630
He looked haggard and ward.
I doubt he had slept for a week.

894
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:19,060
The whole company area was covered
by the most intense Spandau fire and

895
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,110
defensive and the defensive battle
here was one of fire supremacy,

896
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,450
which the Germans had undoubtedly one,

897
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:30,820
a company's morale was low.
They had just lost Harry Barnes,

898
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,290
one of the platoon commanders who refusing
to take cover strutted about in his

899
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:36,124
usual manner.

900
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,840
He took a complete burst of
Spandau fire under the arm.

901
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:46,570
Harry was an amazing and fearless fellow
who didn't care a damn for anything.

902
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:51,430
Even after the burst hit him,
he still lived for about three hours.

903
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:58,370
The men respected Harry and with
their idol shot down in front of them,

904
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,110
they were very jumpy.

905
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,213
Okay.

906
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,640
Nother time you have to watch
out for morale, obviously.

907
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,993
Now,

908
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:13,643
okay,

909
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:14,401
if you remember,

910
00:58:14,401 --> 00:58:17,460
this book started in the summertime
and now we're starting to get

911
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:22,320
towards fall and this,

912
00:58:22,321 --> 00:58:24,330
this was something I'd
never thought about before.

913
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,900
When fall comes, you know the sun
is up for a shorter period of time.

914
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,420
Three. Here we go. Back to the book.

915
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:35,460
The knights became longer and
the dawn's gray and chilly.

916
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:40,740
The sunsets were red and vivid and the
days though beautiful shortened rapidly

917
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,290
as the knights lengthened the hours of
stag lengthened and with them the mental

918
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:49,050
and physical fatigue of the company,
so

919
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:54,930
they have to stay after, stay up, you
know, go rotate through watches at night.

920
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,590
You just don't get to sleep the whole
time. So if it's, if it's dark for longer,

921
00:58:58,591 --> 00:59:00,240
you got to stay awake longer at night.

922
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,160
So it's starting to wear
on the company itself.

923
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:08,880
Back to the book, there
was, there is one incident,

924
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:13,650
small room that when remembered by
itself in a life of such incidents,

925
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:17,940
but very,
but to me very vivid in my platoon,

926
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:21,620
there was a young lad
aged 18 named Biddle.

927
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,000
He was slight of build fair
and looked a mere child.

928
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,850
He had a pleasant personality
and it was liked by everyone.

929
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:37,810
He had joined the company at Lawmen Sell
Milan after we had crossed the CN at

930
00:59:38,751 --> 00:59:42,470
Vernon in August
one morning.

931
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:47,540
There was a crack in a
short interval of silence.

932
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:54,430
Soon the shout went out. Stretcher
bearers echoed through the orchard.

933
00:59:55,930 --> 01:00:00,730
I ran towards the commotion and saw
Biddle writhing in agony on the ground.

934
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,290
Okay.

935
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,980
At first he looked on hurt,
but as I tore open his tunic,

936
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:11,060
I saw clear wound through his
abdomen coming out by a spine.

937
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,380
He soon became numb and
was no longer in pain,

938
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,690
but was very frightened and shivered.

939
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:25,800
We dragged him back behind the house and
applied field dressings to his stomach

940
01:00:25,801 --> 01:00:28,530
and his back in case the
wound started to bleed.

941
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,760
Is young life solely ebbing from his body?

942
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:38,910
Our stretcher bearers quietly
and reverently carried him away.

943
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,360
The scene is now to poignant to
remember without shedding a tear

944
01:00:47,910 --> 01:00:51,780
after Biddle had been evacuated,
the morale of the platoon dropped.

945
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:58,630
He had been hit while standing in his
slit trench by a sniper at least 300 yards

946
01:00:58,631 --> 01:00:59,464
away.

947
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:07,950
And you know, it's, it's interesting,

948
01:01:07,951 --> 01:01:09,600
and I didn't go into this part,

949
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:13,480
but there's a part earlier
in the book where he,

950
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,690
he basically

951
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,400
disparages somewhat the use of snipers

952
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:27,620
and he talks about how they usually
don't gain you anything tactically.

953
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:31,920
Okay.

954
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,930
But it's interesting what it does to
the morale of apple tune, isn't it?

955
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:35,933
Okay.

956
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:40,990
And He, you know, he doesn't complete. No,
he, he, he explains that there's usage.

957
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,040
Then there's,
believe me,

958
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,170
there's probably no bigger believer in
the use of snipers in the world than me,

959
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:53,380
but it's interesting, you know, he, he
basically, you can tell he's a very, uh,

960
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,740
a guy with,
you know,

961
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:59,690
this extremely high moral character
and he kind of gets the feeling when he

962
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:01,070
explains it that,
you know,

963
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:05,570
he didn't feel comfortable with sniping
because people aren't expecting it.

964
01:02:05,571 --> 01:02:09,250
There's not a battle happening. He
felt like he was a cheap shot. Hmm.

965
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:15,020
Interesting. But it's interesting the
effect that it actually has on his platoon

966
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,980
in this moment

967
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,960
here. We're going to get to a point,
he's got, Germans are in a dyke,

968
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:28,710
they're just ahead of it. 18 platoon
and 18 platoon is kind of pin down.

969
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,050
And remember this character from earlier,
Dennis Clark, Dennis Clark was the,

970
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,000
was the guy that pulled
him aside and said, hey,

971
01:02:36,001 --> 01:02:38,400
you need to take Amanda this company.
Well, like I said, Dennis Clark,

972
01:02:38,401 --> 01:02:41,640
or I thought I remembered I was right.
Dennis Clark was a,

973
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:47,070
was an artillery guy that
called in artillery, so here
we go. Back to the book,

974
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:51,300
I was saved by Captain Dennis Clark Mc,

975
01:02:51,390 --> 01:02:52,590
our team gunner.

976
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,430
Dennis had a virtuoso
touch where 25 pounders,

977
01:02:56,431 --> 01:03:01,431
we're concerned sniping with one
gun that should get the buggers out.

978
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:06,750
He said with total confidence
moving his 19 set into my,

979
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:10,050
that's a radio moving as 19
set into my platoon position.

980
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,730
No easy task and daylight.

981
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:16,230
He gave us a display of the most brilliant
professionalism we had come to expect

982
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:21,350
from the 94th field regimen by firing
with only one gun and making his main

983
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:25,560
point of impact beyond the
dike containing the Germans.

984
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:30,740
He slowly decreased the d range yard
by yard until one shell exploded in the

985
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:32,574
dike.

986
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:37,770
Out came five very wet and
shaken pans are granted deers.

987
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,020
During this episode,

988
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:45,080
all the platoon had to remain in the
bottom of their slit trenches because

989
01:03:45,091 --> 01:03:49,110
Dennis shells came over our
positions with minimum clearance.

990
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:54,240
I doubt if any experienced
infantry officer would deny
that the royal artillery

991
01:03:54,241 --> 01:03:58,680
during the Second World War where the
most professionally competent people in

992
01:03:58,681 --> 01:04:01,980
the British army.
So again,

993
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:06,900
an interesting dichotomy because in
the beginning he talks about how the

994
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:11,040
artillery can track them because it's
being used in this broad plan that's

995
01:04:11,041 --> 01:04:13,170
locking in where there's no deviation.

996
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,640
But here he's talking about how
brilliant it is because he's directly

997
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:18,510
coordinating with it.

998
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:22,710
He's explaining to the artillery
officer where to put those rounds,

999
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:25,710
what the problem is, and then letting
the artillery officer's solvent.

1000
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:30,000
So there's a dichotomy there. Just like
there's a dichotomy with the snipers

1001
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,310
back to the book.
After a few more days in the orchard,

1002
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,540
we were becoming increasingly exhausted
and are fighting efficiency deteriorated.

1003
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:44,890
This condition existed not only in my
company but throughout the battalion.

1004
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:49,060
Consequently, the news of a move
back to rest came as a colossal,

1005
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,830
colossal relief to us all,

1006
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,790
but we did not know who is going
to take over our positions.

1007
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:59,920
The takeover was to be at night and was
to be carried out as quickly as possible.

1008
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:01,510
If the enemy discovered it,

1009
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,450
a determined attack could cause
endless confusion and slaughter.

1010
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,500
During the late afternoon of
one particularly unpleasant day,

1011
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,480
Douglas appeared that's
a company commander,

1012
01:05:10,510 --> 01:05:14,920
appeared with an American captain and two
lieutenants from a parachute battalion

1013
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:16,960
of the hundred and
first airborne division.

1014
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:22,720
They pad it around the company Area and
they're rubber soled boots with the eyes

1015
01:05:22,721 --> 01:05:24,250
or the whole company following them,

1016
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,520
so the hundred and first is
coming in to relieve them

1017
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,620
having record ordered our area,

1018
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:33,460
the Americans returned to the company
HQ to discuss administrative points for

1019
01:05:33,461 --> 01:05:34,294
the takeover.

1020
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:37,930
The plan was for the American company
commander to bring his company down the

1021
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:40,360
main road in single file
along the edge of the ditch.

1022
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,030
When the head of the column
reached our company Hq,

1023
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:46,390
it would be met by guides from each
of our pl tunes to lead the American

1024
01:05:46,391 --> 01:05:49,420
platoons, their positions. As
soon as they were on the ground,

1025
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:51,970
our platoons were withdraw
and assemble on the road.

1026
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:55,870
This may sound simple in practice at,

1027
01:05:55,930 --> 01:06:00,610
but at night in close contact with
the enemy, it certainly was not.

1028
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:04,600
This type of operation leaves to
companies particularly vulnerable.

1029
01:06:04,601 --> 01:06:05,740
During the handover,

1030
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,970
a determined enemy could attack and
turn the operation into a massacre.

1031
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:13,430
This is one of,
and I've said this before on the podcast,

1032
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:18,130
so one of the hardest things to do is
link up with friendly forces on the

1033
01:06:18,131 --> 01:06:22,750
battlefield and if you're under fire,
it's, it's even harder. So this one,

1034
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:26,350
they're trying to do it, not under
fire, trying to sneak in, make it happen

1035
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:30,460
back to the book.
The rest of the day was spent packing,

1036
01:06:30,461 --> 01:06:33,580
making sure the enemy noticed
nothing of this anti activity.

1037
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:37,510
We put our spare rounds ammunition
onto the carriers with great coats and

1038
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:40,030
blankets.
The whole afternoon was strangely quiet.

1039
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:43,150
There was no activity from the
enemy and we in turn kept quiet.

1040
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,350
The Sun went down and made a fiery sky.
Looking east,

1041
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:51,820
the sky was threateningly gray.
I went around,

1042
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:56,620
I went round my position too with Sergeant
Kingston before the Americans arrived.

1043
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:00,430
All my men look tired and
could hardly muster a smile.

1044
01:07:00,431 --> 01:07:02,140
As I went from slit the slit,

1045
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:08,220
many had contained two men
and now contained only one
together with some Momento

1046
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,470
of his former mate,
a mess tin or a blood stain jacket,

1047
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:19,810
even a packet of cigarettes,
wet and limp with do.

1048
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:26,270
I wondered how many more momentos
would be there when the Americans were

1049
01:07:26,271 --> 01:07:30,220
relieved.
About an hour later,

1050
01:07:30,221 --> 01:07:34,840
the Americans arrived. They loomed
up in the darkness by the road side,

1051
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,960
padding along and the rubber
soled boots without a whisper.

1052
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:43,390
I thought at the time what splendid
troops they were and how excellent their

1053
01:07:43,391 --> 01:07:44,224
equipment.

1054
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:49,240
I was particularly impressed by the silent
and quick way they were led by their

1055
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:54,160
squad commanders to our section positions.
So

1056
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:57,220
there come the Americans to relieve him.

1057
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,640
The hundred and first Airborne Division
who's just outstanding soldiers.

1058
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,440
They're just awesome
and we worked with them.

1059
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,490
It'd be one of my platoons in Ramadi,
worked with,

1060
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,610
lived with them the first of
five oh six the band of brothers,

1061
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:18,210
and you can tell they're the reputation
that the guys in Ramadi upheld that

1062
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:22,550
standard in every possible way.

1063
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,790
But it's rooted all the way
back to the soldiers right here.

1064
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:29,510
Sounds like this is what struck me when
I read that I was like all this, this,

1065
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:30,170
that,

1066
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:35,170
that tradition of excellence in that
unit has gone from World War II,

1067
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:38,030
from these guys right here,

1068
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,750
and it's that same attitude that I saw
with guys and Ramadi, this same attitude.

1069
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:46,300
Hmm.
All right.

1070
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:52,040
Now he makes a statement here
about this whole big operation,

1071
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,420
which was called market garden,

1072
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:57,170
which was this giant
operation to try and cut off.

1073
01:08:57,171 --> 01:08:59,510
The Germans sees multiple bridges.

1074
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:03,710
I can give us three bridges they
were trying to seize and it,

1075
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:07,790
it didn't reach its full effect.
It wasn't like a complete mission success.

1076
01:09:07,791 --> 01:09:11,240
They didn't achieve every
objective that they wanted to.

1077
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,950
So here we go. Back to the book.
Market Garden was a sad operation.

1078
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:20,810
Complete success coming so close
at a stroke.

1079
01:09:20,811 --> 01:09:25,811
The war in Europe could have been
finished in 1944 undoubtedly,

1080
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:29,720
mistakes were made both by
the first airborne division,

1081
01:09:29,721 --> 01:09:31,010
particularly their planners,

1082
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:35,120
and also by 30 core and there
was no shortage of bad luck.

1083
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,140
However, in my experiences,
in my experience,

1084
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:41,990
most battles are riddled with
misfortunes and mistakes.

1085
01:09:41,991 --> 01:09:44,570
And the story of the sort
found in this operation,

1086
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:51,040
it was not a failure because the ground
was taken and a prerequisite to both

1087
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:55,640
operation veritable and
the Rhine crossing. So it
wasn't like a total failure.

1088
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:57,560
Back to the book.

1089
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:01,970
I'm convinced that had the supreme
commander General Eisenhower Given Market

1090
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:05,450
Garden,
the unqualified support that it justified,

1091
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:10,220
it would have totally succeeded despite
its crop of tactical errors and planning

1092
01:10:10,221 --> 01:10:11,150
and execution.

1093
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:17,230
I suppose it was just one more casualty
of the American mania for dispersal of

1094
01:10:17,511 --> 01:10:20,060
effort.
However,

1095
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:24,080
it was without a doubt the most exciting
and imaginatively planned battle in

1096
01:10:24,081 --> 01:10:27,230
which 18 platoon ever fought.
And I'm proud to have taken part.

1097
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:31,010
So he's talking about folks of effort.
He's talking about you.

1098
01:10:31,011 --> 01:10:32,810
If you spread yourself out too thin,
you're not gonna,

1099
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:35,090
you're not gonna make it happen.
We call that prioritize and execute.

1100
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,210
What's the biggest priority?
Let's put our resources there.

1101
01:10:38,370 --> 01:10:39,203
Hmm.

1102
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:44,110
They didn't do that and therefore
didn't get a full mission success. Now,

1103
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:48,010
of course, what resources were
there? What was available?

1104
01:10:48,070 --> 01:10:52,900
There's no one has on limited
resources. No one, if you have that,

1105
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:57,160
you have no issues, right?
Yeah. And you're just crushed
problems with manpower.

1106
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:00,550
All right.

1107
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:05,590
So now they're moving beyond
market garden and planning,

1108
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,770
uh, that actually
planning. He's planning a,

1109
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:11,260
a patrol through a village.

1110
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:15,420
Back to the book battle school teaching
at the time prescribed a strength of 12

1111
01:11:15,421 --> 01:11:18,300
to 20 for a fighting patrol.
Here again,

1112
01:11:18,301 --> 01:11:22,800
my instincts and experience did not
conform to their teaching. He's a rebel.

1113
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:27,870
How can you command and control
that number of men in the dark,

1114
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:31,710
particularly in a skirmish?
Douglas, the company commander,

1115
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:36,030
tolerant of the absent
absency of my opinions

1116
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,520
on these matters left the planning to me.
So cool.

1117
01:11:41,521 --> 01:11:44,520
Douglas's little these
centralized command. Did you
figure out your plan then?

1118
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:45,721
I like this.

1119
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:50,721
The composition of the patrol I based
on personalities and not on a battle

1120
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:53,060
school, they're ordained
number. So imagine that you're,

1121
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:56,130
you're planning based into on the
personalities of the individuals.

1122
01:11:56,131 --> 01:11:59,580
You have the countryside
being comparatively open.

1123
01:11:59,581 --> 01:12:02,280
I decided to take a Bren gun being steady.

1124
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,190
Williams and filmer would
fill the bill admirably.

1125
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:07,520
If we ran into trouble,

1126
01:12:07,521 --> 01:12:11,270
they could provide covering fire for any
assault we might make or if things went

1127
01:12:11,271 --> 01:12:13,580
badly, they could cover our
withdrawal covering move.

1128
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:18,410
Obviously the assault party
required strengthening,

1129
01:12:18,411 --> 01:12:21,380
so I decided to take a total
patrol strength of six men.

1130
01:12:21,381 --> 01:12:26,381
One Bren with seven magazines and three
arms with statins were five magazines

1131
01:12:26,721 --> 01:12:30,320
and four 36 grenades each
plus a pair of wire cutters.

1132
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:34,400
I carried my colt four
grenades and an umbrella.

1133
01:12:35,870 --> 01:12:38,900
My umbrella had been a source of amusement
to the platoons since I had found it

1134
01:12:38,901 --> 01:12:43,901
on the roadside and moocs apart from
keeping me dry in or out of a slit trench.

1135
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:48,020
It was useful when prodding for mines
and brought some fun and color to our

1136
01:12:48,021 --> 01:12:48,854
lives.

1137
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:54,080
Jim Kingston and Doug proctor fought
otherwise maintaining a disapproving

1138
01:12:54,081 --> 01:12:58,730
silence, which I failed to notice,
so now they're out on patrol.

1139
01:12:58,731 --> 01:12:59,780
Moving down the bank to the right,

1140
01:12:59,781 --> 01:13:02,750
we crawled forward in the mud and wet
grass until we were almost past the

1141
01:13:02,751 --> 01:13:06,830
orchard from which came the
sound of digging and voices.

1142
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,200
Suddenly a challenge came from our front,

1143
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,030
followed by a shower of stick grenades
thrown from a trench just inside the

1144
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:15,380
orchard on our left.

1145
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,070
One of the grenades
landed between my legs,

1146
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:23,390
which were stretched out and spread apart.
As I lay flat on the river bank.

1147
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:28,160
There was no flash. It's explosion
seemed muffled and more importantly,

1148
01:13:28,430 --> 01:13:32,270
owing to the soft mud I received,
not a scratch.

1149
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:34,721
The game was up.

1150
01:13:34,721 --> 01:13:38,290
Now the concentrated fire of the
three stands poured into the German,

1151
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,900
into the surprise.
Germans putting away my pistol,

1152
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:45,550
I threw three 36 grenades in
quick succession into the orchard,

1153
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:48,460
hurriedly reaching for my umbrella,
which alluded me.

1154
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,940
And then ignominiously
ignominiously we beat a retreat.

1155
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,383
So

1156
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:57,680
okay,

1157
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,880
he gets our gray throw at them. And I
actually had this happen to you bruiser.

1158
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:04,010
Some guys were out on a patrol.
They were an open field.

1159
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:07,950
They had cover from one side because
they had preplanned how they're going

1160
01:14:07,970 --> 01:14:09,830
across this field and
while they're out there,

1161
01:14:09,831 --> 01:14:11,920
they got hit with machine
gun fire and then mortars.

1162
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,770
And they got mortars date on them.

1163
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,300
And luckily because it was,

1164
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:22,570
they weren't in like a muddy field,

1165
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:27,280
like almost rice patty scenario.
The mortars, when they hit,

1166
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,820
they went into the mud and so
they exploded, but there was no,

1167
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,930
all the disruption was all absorbed
by the mud. That's lucky day for tea.

1168
01:14:34,931 --> 01:14:35,980
You bruiser right there.

1169
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:39,420
Boys were little little fired up
when they came back from that one.

1170
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:43,660
Now they get back into
a defensive perimeter.

1171
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,240
I remember nights and defensive positions
like grosbeak stretched out in a slit

1172
01:14:49,241 --> 01:14:53,350
trench trying to get an hour sleep before
going round the platoon positions to

1173
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:55,450
check that everything and
everyone was all right.

1174
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,390
One felt and was dirty and in the small
hours of the morning with boot laces

1175
01:15:01,391 --> 01:15:06,040
cutting into swollen feet of foul
tasting mouth and an aching stomach,

1176
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,110
life had little to commend it.

1177
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:13,680
The dirt and discomfort worried
me more than the danger danger.

1178
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:16,470
For some reason that I've
never understood exhilarates,

1179
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:19,710
but despite every effort to keep clean,

1180
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:23,220
it did not always prove possible
and that was unbearable.

1181
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:29,420
Never once since I never once since have
I not been grateful to sink into a hot

1182
01:15:31,171 --> 01:15:34,410
bath or slide into a
bed with clean sheets.

1183
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:40,260
We went to extraordinary lengths to
keep the dirt at bay. Once in Normandy,

1184
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:44,790
I washed and shaved in the rain
water in the deep ruts made by carts.

1185
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:49,760
Afterwards I discovered
that 400 yards away,

1186
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,970
the opposition had been
overlooking my absolutions

1187
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,330
a decent lot, who obviously
approved of my personal hygiene.

1188
01:15:59,331 --> 01:16:04,010
So if they didn't kill him, Hey,
this guy's just trying to be clean.

1189
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:08,540
Let's let him continue back to
the book. During the campaign,

1190
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:11,030
18 platoon carried out
three types of patrols,

1191
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:13,640
reconnaissance standing and fighting.

1192
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:18,680
The first two in variably useful because
they provided information if only

1193
01:16:18,681 --> 01:16:21,620
negative fighting patrols of which I led.

1194
01:16:21,621 --> 01:16:24,290
Many were different and
contemptuous proposition.

1195
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:26,830
Unlike the German and American armies.

1196
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:30,910
We had a vigorous policy regarding
fighting patrols, particularly at night,

1197
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:34,330
and when things were static
on both sides on the defense.

1198
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:40,210
The thinking behind this policy seemed
to me at times to be superficial and

1199
01:16:40,211 --> 01:16:42,970
probably leftover from the
Great War World War One.

1200
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,840
If when detailed for a fighting patrol
young officer's queried the wisdom of its

1201
01:16:49,031 --> 01:16:53,500
given object, there was always the
standard reply. I quite agree with you,

1202
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,260
but it all helps to
dominate no man's land.

1203
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,570
There is undoubtedly a certain
validity of this argument,

1204
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:05,710
but was it worth the consequent loss
of good young officers and CEO's?

1205
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,353
I doubt it.

1206
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,510
Shortly after the war,

1207
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:16,340
I was able to briefly voice my
reservations to my illustrious army group

1208
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:19,850
commander. That's Montgomery. By the way,

1209
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:24,800
after giving me my Mc that's
military cross ribbon,

1210
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:29,450
he stepped back and said,
crisply patrolling is bloody,

1211
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,660
isn't it?
When I stammered,

1212
01:17:32,661 --> 01:17:37,661
that it seemed a bit hard that it was
always the same people chosen for patrols.

1213
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,640
He replied with a twinkle in his eye.

1214
01:17:41,270 --> 01:17:45,740
One day you'll command a battalion
and you'll understand the problem

1215
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:49,220
for 20 year olds.

1216
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:52,850
Sub Alternate Exchange like this
with a field marshal was heady stuff,

1217
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:57,110
but Monty's mischievous humor and utter
lack of compacity coupled with this

1218
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:58,730
single minded professionalism,

1219
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:03,560
professionalism extended his personal
influence to the most junior soldier in

1220
01:18:03,561 --> 01:18:04,850
21st army group.

1221
01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:10,660
We felt we knew him and that
he knew us often he did.

1222
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,113
So

1223
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:19,170
that's a great little interaction.
You know,

1224
01:18:19,171 --> 01:18:24,090
he says patrolling is bloody
work isn't it? And and Sydney,

1225
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,321
Jerry says,

1226
01:18:25,321 --> 01:18:29,790
yeah and the thing is it seems like it's
always the same tunes that get made to

1227
01:18:29,791 --> 01:18:33,870
do the patrolling and he says one day
when you're in charge of Italian you'll

1228
01:18:33,871 --> 01:18:38,470
understand why that is and the reason
why that is cause you've got the good guy

1229
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:39,810
and that's the guy
you're going to send out.

1230
01:18:40,740 --> 01:18:43,170
You're going to rely on the
people that get it done.

1231
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,300
Well this is an interesting,

1232
01:18:50,301 --> 01:18:55,040
we've got another patrol that they're
getting ready to have to go out on and the

1233
01:18:55,041 --> 01:18:58,700
patrol was to pro between the
roads and advance if possible.

1234
01:18:58,701 --> 01:19:03,440
As far as the forest beyond this,
it's purpose was indeed vague.

1235
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:07,460
Douglas called me and another platoon
commander to company HQ and explained it

1236
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:11,210
to us. He then suggested we
should toss a coin for it.

1237
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:17,000
An embarrassing situation arose. I thought
that the winner would lead the patrol.

1238
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:20,390
The other officer had
dissipated that the loser would.

1239
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:25,310
I lost the toss and got the job. So,
so imagine that you and me are saying,

1240
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:27,650
all right, there's a dangerous
patrol we're going to have to do.

1241
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:31,190
Let's flip for it.
I'm thinking heads.

1242
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:34,220
If I win,
I get to do the patrol.

1243
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:37,100
You're thinking in your view when
you don't have to do the patrol?

1244
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:44,060
Uh, not everyone was quite as
fired up, I guess Sydney Jerry was

1245
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:47,180
and they,

1246
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:52,180
they wrap up a relatively
kind of uneventful patrol,

1247
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:55,440
relatively uneventful patrol,

1248
01:19:56,520 --> 01:20:01,430
and he returns and they're having a
cup of tea and some biscuits. Sure.

1249
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,050
In true British form,
back to the book,

1250
01:20:04,051 --> 01:20:06,960
it was then that I suddenly realized
that I'd been commanding 18 platoon for

1251
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:09,120
months to be precise.

1252
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:13,170
Three months and two days before I
joined the battalion in mid July,

1253
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:18,060
I had been worn, worn that my life
expectancy would be about three weeks.

1254
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:20,790
It seems strange to me now,

1255
01:20:21,060 --> 01:20:24,570
but at no time did I anticipate
being either wounded or killed.

1256
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:30,480
I was just too busy for thoughts like
these and I become totally absorbed in my

1257
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:33,690
grim responsibilities.
In July,

1258
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:38,810
I had been written by doubt
about my ability in my innocence.

1259
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:44,390
I'd expected success in battle to be
the prerogative of a victor low Durham,

1260
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,370
which is like the champion.

1261
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:55,530
I now had no such doubts or illusions.
Furthermore,

1262
01:20:55,650 --> 01:21:00,650
I discovered just how much soldiers
resent and fear a young officer who sees

1263
01:21:01,561 --> 01:21:06,561
battle as a means to win his spurs
possibly at the cost of their lives.

1264
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:14,450
So when you grow in and you're Mr
beating your chest and you are who you're

1265
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:17,800
going to prove yourself to the world.
Yeah,

1266
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:23,600
don't be that guy cause you're going to
write checks with my life and we don't

1267
01:21:24,271 --> 01:21:25,104
like that.

1268
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:32,290
My duty had become clear to me it
was to command 18 platoon with quiet

1269
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:36,820
confidence providing
I made them only once.

1270
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:41,910
My mistakes would be forgiven
if my soldiers were to go,

1271
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:46,550
we're going to place their very
lives in my hands. They in return,

1272
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:51,080
we're criers of me,
a serious attitude to my profession.

1273
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:57,870
If I could achieve this with a
light touch so much the better.

1274
01:21:59,160 --> 01:22:03,120
That's an interesting comment.
So you know,

1275
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:05,850
he's saying look what they require.
Is that going to be serious?

1276
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:09,540
I'm got to be as serious as possible.
And the,

1277
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:13,980
it's like you ever heard the term
minimum force required? Yeah. You read,

1278
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:15,930
you probably use that as a
bouncer, right? Yeah. Hey,

1279
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,400
you got to use the minimum force required.

1280
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:21,900
So what he's saying is that as a
leader, the lighter touch, the better,

1281
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:26,190
the lightest touch you can use to lead is
better. That's a pretty cool statement.

1282
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:27,360
That's a good thing to think about.

1283
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:34,450
How can you lead with minimum force
every time you go you use more than you,

1284
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:40,360
then you need your,
you're overexerting right.

1285
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:46,750
And who knows what kind of,
you know you're taken away initiative.

1286
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:51,040
You might be stamping out morale.
So lead with that minimum touch.

1287
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:52,563
I like that.

1288
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,980
So at this point they're in a,

1289
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:01,300
they're in a position and
there's three of these.

1290
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:05,480
Mark three 75 millimeter
self propelled gone.

1291
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:08,620
So they kind of look like tanks.
They got big tracks, they're Germans,

1292
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:12,160
they're German, and their
end, they're sitting out in
front of them, they're in a,

1293
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:15,400
they're in a static position.
The company's in a static position.

1294
01:23:15,550 --> 01:23:20,470
And there's these, these tanks
sitting there, three of them.

1295
01:23:21,550 --> 01:23:24,670
And Douglas looks at him and
he's thinking to himself, hey,

1296
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:27,280
I don't know what those, they
look like, they're functioning,

1297
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:32,620
they don't look damaged. And
so Douglas is saying, okay,

1298
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:35,020
well we need to find out what's going on.
Even if there's no one,

1299
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,020
even if there's no one in them right now.
Or it could be a place where they,

1300
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:39,810
you snipers later.
Hmm.

1301
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,960
So someone's got to go check them out.

1302
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:48,700
So Sydney, Jerry, the
guy, he goes out alone,

1303
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:50,440
Kinda sneaks out there.

1304
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:53,950
He does stuff alone a little bit more
often than it actually does stuff alone.

1305
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:56,320
There's another story I didn't mention,

1306
01:23:56,321 --> 01:24:01,210
but at one point there he hears noise.
Look,

1307
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:03,400
one of the guys reports it's
nighttime and they hear,

1308
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:04,540
they hear noise in this field.

1309
01:24:04,541 --> 01:24:07,360
They think there's an enemy
out there and he's white wall.

1310
01:24:07,361 --> 01:24:09,790
There's one way to find out.
So he,

1311
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:14,140
I think he does grab another guy in this
occasion but it goes out and he's going

1312
01:24:14,141 --> 01:24:17,760
through this field and it's
like a cornfield or something
and he can't see any,

1313
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:22,000
he's horrified and he can,
he's trying to think of a reason to quit.

1314
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:26,700
He's like, I just want to go back.
This isn't smart. And as he's,

1315
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:28,570
as this is taking place in,

1316
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:33,580
his fear is climaxing all
of a sudden he hears a

1317
01:24:35,500 --> 01:24:37,510
bunch of cows and it feel good around.

1318
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:41,710
So he's doing another solo operation here,

1319
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:47,350
trying to find out what these tank
like assault guns are doing out there.

1320
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:52,090
Back to the book, climbing up above the
tracks. I put my head into the Cupola,

1321
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:55,570
which was open,
a familiar and terrible stench.

1322
01:24:55,571 --> 01:25:00,571
Hit me inside was a Sharnell
house six inches away,

1323
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:05,820
a set of bare teeth set in unrecognizable
black and incinerated lump grinned at

1324
01:25:07,271 --> 01:25:09,840
me
beside it.

1325
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:13,020
A chart and bony arm reached up in agony,

1326
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:19,530
spread on the floor like a pool of tar
lay. The melted remains of the driver.

1327
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:24,100
I had entered Dante's inferno.

1328
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:25,530
Yeah,

1329
01:25:25,530 --> 01:25:27,900
my head real and with my mouth,

1330
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:32,940
nose and lungs filled with the stench
of death. I fell back to the ground,

1331
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:37,560
although on marked by
fire on all on our side,

1332
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:42,510
all three assault guns had brewed up
and were black and on their sides which

1333
01:25:42,511 --> 01:25:43,470
faced the enemy.

1334
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:45,120
Okay

1335
01:25:45,120 --> 01:25:46,770
with no stomach to look further.

1336
01:25:46,950 --> 01:25:50,550
I ran back to the company for
getting to look for American minds.

1337
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:51,890
Okay.

1338
01:25:51,890 --> 01:25:55,160
Never again did I look into a
knocked out tank or self propelled.

1339
01:25:55,161 --> 01:26:00,161
Guns are reported a Douglas that nobody
in their right mind would use them for

1340
01:26:00,921 --> 01:26:03,770
an observation post or for any purpose.

1341
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:08,470
Later that day he asks,

1342
01:26:08,490 --> 01:26:12,600
that's Douglas Douglas asked the commander
of a Sherman tank to fire some armor

1343
01:26:12,601 --> 01:26:16,890
piercing shells into each of them
positioning his tank hold down.

1344
01:26:16,891 --> 01:26:21,891
Besides 16 platoons positions which
were two are left the tank commanders to

1345
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:26,990
take greater first selected the assault
gun I had visited his first shell hit.

1346
01:26:27,661 --> 01:26:31,310
It's slightly above the tracks
like the hammer, a Vulcan,

1347
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:37,490
a red glow blossomed on the armor plate
around the point of entry and slowly

1348
01:26:37,981 --> 01:26:38,814
faded.

1349
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:43,410
It was followed by a second and third
shell until a mirage of heat appeared

1350
01:26:43,411 --> 01:26:48,411
above it and for a second time the
funeral pyre blazed with an incandescent

1351
01:26:48,631 --> 01:26:49,464
ferocity.

1352
01:26:50,850 --> 01:26:54,210
The Sherman gunner then turned his
attention to the next assault gun,

1353
01:26:54,211 --> 01:26:58,350
which despite being penetrated by
about six armor piercing rounds,

1354
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,520
failed to brew up his
first shot at the third,

1355
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:04,800
caused a massive internal designation,

1356
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:10,010
no doubt due to ammunition stacked
within a volcano erupted from its cappola

1357
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:16,140
sending a dense cloud of black smoke,
smoke and red sparks into the air.

1358
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:22,940
A truly Wagnerian and for the
warriors and tuned within,

1359
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:24,560
but it revolted me

1360
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,200
for the rest of the day.

1361
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:33,260
I booted this communicated itself to
my NCS and soldiers who stole mystified

1362
01:27:34,891 --> 01:27:38,010
glances at my grief for an unknown enemy.

1363
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:40,740
During the afternoon,

1364
01:27:40,741 --> 01:27:44,760
I wandered across the road to a loan house
were Dennis Clark had his observation

1365
01:27:44,761 --> 01:27:48,870
post. I was looking for solace
from a wise and good friend.

1366
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,230
The post was filled with Gunnar officers.

1367
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:55,800
There must have been a dozen of them
setting up their equipment in preparation

1368
01:27:55,801 --> 01:27:58,560
for an attack by two one four brigade.

1369
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,520
This activity precluded any solace for me,

1370
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:08,670
immature and undisciplined.
My imagination ran riot.

1371
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:09,990
What would they like?

1372
01:28:09,991 --> 01:28:14,991
These men who's already incinerated
remains had been blasted into oblivion by

1373
01:28:15,781 --> 01:28:19,530
the 75 millimeter shells of
our friend in the Sherman.

1374
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,320
My attitude door was ambivalent.

1375
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,040
Undoubtedly I was parked pacifist,

1376
01:28:28,250 --> 01:28:33,250
but despite an abysmal record in
mathematics and particularly in geometry,

1377
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:36,050
I was moderately logical for my age.

1378
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:40,730
This clearly ruled out total
dedication to pacifism.

1379
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:46,930
I had previously discussed the concept
of conscientious objection with clergy of

1380
01:28:46,931 --> 01:28:48,070
all denominations,

1381
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:51,580
but none of them could give me
constructive answers to my questions.

1382
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:58,570
The privations and suffering
of 18 platoon hurt me

1383
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:02,390
an saw Baltar

1384
01:29:02,390 --> 01:29:06,360
and he's faced with a conflict
which cannot be resolved.

1385
01:29:08,290 --> 01:29:12,640
One gets emotionally involved
with those under one's command.

1386
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:15,630
Without this bond,

1387
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:20,790
few men will respond and
consequently little can be achieved.

1388
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:25,080
However,
to win battles,

1389
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:30,140
decisions have to be taken and orders
given which at times may seem to be a

1390
01:29:31,411 --> 01:29:33,330
betrayal of this trust.

1391
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:36,740
Before battle,

1392
01:29:37,490 --> 01:29:40,940
the commander must exude
confidence and enthusiasm.

1393
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:43,880
Whatever fears his
private thoughts may hold.

1394
01:29:46,290 --> 01:29:50,520
Just how thin aligned divides
this from deliberate deception.

1395
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:57,720
I call it the commander's dilemma,
a pretentious phrase,

1396
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,060
but there is nothing to be done about it.

1397
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:04,600
In Nicholas Montserrat's book,

1398
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:09,720
the Cruel Sea Poor Commander Eric
Hansen makes the point with poignancy.

1399
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:11,043
Yeah,

1400
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:15,210
it's the war,
the whole bloody war.

1401
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:20,610
We've just got to do these things
and say our prayers. At the end

1402
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:27,290
there was another side
possibly caused by adrenaline,

1403
01:30:29,190 --> 01:30:32,400
danger,
attracted and excited me.

1404
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:36,480
I felt elated and until
the battle was over,

1405
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:41,060
I was impervious to exhaustion.
Commanding a platoon,

1406
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:45,680
embattled demands not only a clear mind,
but also considerable emotional force.

1407
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:52,630
I suspect it is the same transmitted
force that exists between a conductor and

1408
01:30:53,391 --> 01:30:57,980
orchestra.
40 years later,

1409
01:30:57,981 --> 01:31:01,700
the dilemma of my ambivalence
is still unresolved.

1410
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:06,420
I find the suffering inflicted by war,
unacceptable,

1411
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:10,020
particularly amongst women,
children and animals.

1412
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:14,560
Thank God I was spared the horrific sites.

1413
01:31:14,561 --> 01:31:18,800
It filets on some days I am a pacifist

1414
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:25,420
and yet I'm still attracted by the sounds
of guns and but for an extraordinarily

1415
01:31:25,971 --> 01:31:30,971
happy marriage would have
found it difficult to resist
the lure of soldiering.

1416
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:42,970
So what he calls
the commanders dilemma,

1417
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:45,910
and this what I call the
dichotomy of leadership.

1418
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:50,860
And that one is the premier of the mall.

1419
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:56,380
And that is as a leader,
as a combat leader,

1420
01:31:57,670 --> 01:32:01,720
there you are going love your man

1421
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:07,780
and care about them more than
anything else in the world.

1422
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,270
And with that,

1423
01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:12,230
okay,

1424
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:16,820
you are going to make
decisions and make plans

1425
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:23,330
where you are sending those men into a
situation to where they can be wounded or

1426
01:32:23,331 --> 01:32:24,680
killed.
And that's it.

1427
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:31,800
And that is the ultimate
dichotomy of leadership.

1428
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:34,080
That is the hardest one to balance

1429
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:45,760
back to the book,
a new officer arrived named Humphreys.

1430
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:50,170
He used to play cricket for worst usher.

1431
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:55,850
He came on the same day that sergeant
Oxland received a well earned commission

1432
01:32:55,851 --> 01:32:56,684
in the field.

1433
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:57,980
Okay?

1434
01:32:57,980 --> 01:33:02,450
Douglass told them about sergeant Oxland
and with great consideration he went to

1435
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:05,780
17 platoons position to
offer as congratulations.

1436
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:07,590
Okay.

1437
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:11,910
While they talked just one salvo
of one oh five straddled them,

1438
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:17,620
one shell fell into second lieutenant
Auckland's slit trench and both were

1439
01:33:17,621 --> 01:33:21,230
killed instantly.
Like me,

1440
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:23,900
Ken Oxen has survived five months,

1441
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,860
Humphrey survived,
not a full day.

1442
01:33:32,150 --> 01:33:36,920
Is there a mathematical formula by
which survival can be calculated?

1443
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:42,090
Who are the survivors and
can they be recognized

1444
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:46,800
over the past 40 years?
I've often pondered this,

1445
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:48,960
but still offer no real answer.

1446
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:50,880
Okay.

1447
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:53,880
I suspect, however, that is
something to do with attitude.

1448
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:59,040
The attitude seems to me to be a
parameter which restricts not only our

1449
01:33:59,641 --> 01:34:02,160
relationships,
but also our creative effort.

1450
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,030
Further comment is unwise.
Humphreys,

1451
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:13,180
one could argue had little time to develop
an attitude to our kind of existence.

1452
01:34:14,570 --> 01:34:19,570
Undoubtedly a self fulfilling circle
develops newcomers inexperienced in the

1453
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:23,660
perils of the battlefield,
suffered the highest casualties,

1454
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:28,210
knowledge of what can and what cannot be.

1455
01:34:28,211 --> 01:34:32,050
Wrist postpones the fatal
recognizing for the soldier.

1456
01:34:33,540 --> 01:34:34,260
Yeah,

1457
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,030
for the commander.
However,

1458
01:34:36,031 --> 01:34:40,050
Jr battlefield experience
will not only protect himself,

1459
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:43,080
but also all those under his command.

1460
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:46,433
Okay.

1461
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:50,570
And that's the,
that's why training is so important.

1462
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:56,030
So important. And that's why when I got
done with, you know, deployment to Ramadi,

1463
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,480
it's why went to training?
Because I knew that right there

1464
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:02,190
and I was thinking,
you know,

1465
01:35:02,191 --> 01:35:04,980
I didn't know how long the water was
going to ask him when we left Ramadi.

1466
01:35:04,981 --> 01:35:06,480
Ramadi was still horrible.

1467
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:08,470
Okay.

1468
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:10,570
And when the task unit
came in, relieved us, man,

1469
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:14,770
they were getting after it and I didn't
know how long that was gonna last.

1470
01:35:14,830 --> 01:35:18,220
I mean, it ended up not lasting that much
longer, that kind of intense fighting,

1471
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,650
but it was impossible
to tell at that time.

1472
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:27,070
We were just barely seeing stuff start
to get started to get better at the end

1473
01:35:27,071 --> 01:35:31,270
of our deployment, just barely starting
to see the first indications of that

1474
01:35:35,860 --> 01:35:36,730
back to the book.

1475
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:41,810
Okay.

1476
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:45,700
The fifth Duke of Cornwall is Light
Infantry at attempted to attack Hoven

1477
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:50,710
village through these ghastly woods
and had taken heavy casualties there.

1478
01:35:51,291 --> 01:35:56,120
Rain soaked bodies littered the paths
and clearings while carrying out a

1479
01:35:56,121 --> 01:35:59,960
reconnaissance. I came across one
of their sections lying across,

1480
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,900
lying along a small path facing the enemy.

1481
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:04,320
Okay.

1482
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:04,741
At first,

1483
01:36:04,741 --> 01:36:09,450
I fought them alive until I saw that
the studs on their boots were rusty and

1484
01:36:09,451 --> 01:36:11,730
their webbing equipment
was bleached with rain.

1485
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:18,190
Their battle dress was starched with mud
and their hands and faces were green.

1486
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:23,480
German booby traps were on
or near many of the tracks,

1487
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:28,130
and I was told by the company commander
of the fourth wheelchairs from whom we

1488
01:36:28,131 --> 01:36:31,970
took over the position that some of
the bodies were also booby trapped.

1489
01:36:33,570 --> 01:36:35,520
Don't try to bury them.
He said

1490
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:41,080
I was temporarily commanding the company
because Douglas had been given a well

1491
01:36:41,081 --> 01:36:44,610
deserved leave and Brussels,
although militarily,

1492
01:36:44,611 --> 01:36:49,050
comparatively uneventful,
Hoven has a special place in my memories.

1493
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:51,330
It was without a doubt my most,

1494
01:36:51,331 --> 01:36:54,900
the most grisly and horrifying
position that we ever hold held.

1495
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,190
But more importantly,

1496
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,600
it was the place of private
Charles Ravens triumph.

1497
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:07,920
Raven had fought in all our battles
since hill one 12 which to him was a yard

1498
01:37:07,981 --> 01:37:08,920
stick of horror.

1499
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:14,530
All subsequent experience was
compared with that. His first battle,

1500
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,520
he was no soldier.

1501
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:23,800
I doubt if he influenced greatly any of
the skirmishes and counters or battles

1502
01:37:23,801 --> 01:37:24,820
in which he took part.

1503
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:30,010
Sometimes he was frightened and he was
so out of place on the battlefield that I

1504
01:37:30,011 --> 01:37:32,830
often wondered how he
became an infantry soldier

1505
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:37,340
before the war.
He had been a clerk in north London.

1506
01:37:38,980 --> 01:37:43,980
I'm sure he was a conscientious and loyal
employee and a considerate and loving

1507
01:37:44,261 --> 01:37:47,590
husband for unlike most of us.
He was married.

1508
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:49,703
Yeah.

1509
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:54,720
Raven had hidden depths and could be
inspired once a Normandy during a nasty

1510
01:37:57,021 --> 01:37:58,910
little platoon attack up a sunken lane.

1511
01:37:58,911 --> 01:38:03,911
18 platoon was held up by the inevitable
unlocated spanned dose straining my

1512
01:38:05,521 --> 01:38:06,570
eyes through binoculars.

1513
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:11,670
I was trying vainly to locate these guns
when I was handed a steaming mug of tea.

1514
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:13,500
Yeah,

1515
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:17,280
he should've been observing to his
front, but judging the moment, right,

1516
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:23,060
he had brewed a mess tin of tea on
a solid fuel stove by any standards.

1517
01:38:24,780 --> 01:38:26,520
This wasn't inspired act.

1518
01:38:28,530 --> 01:38:32,730
He was considerate with our
reinforcements. Pale on sure men,

1519
01:38:32,731 --> 01:38:36,870
some of whom until recently it served
in the royal artillery and had been

1520
01:38:36,871 --> 01:38:41,490
transferred to infantry regiments to
replace the appalling losses incurred in

1521
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:45,730
the Norman depot cottage.
Beside them,

1522
01:38:45,940 --> 01:38:48,310
raven looked bronzed and weather beaten.

1523
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:52,660
A hardened campaigner complete with
a German Luger pistol to prove it.

1524
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:59,260
Some of the platoon regaled
the reinforcements with
horrible tales from Normandy

1525
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:03,620
and elsed as little
more than a school boy.

1526
01:39:03,740 --> 01:39:07,670
I found these stories
and music raven did not.

1527
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:14,150
Fear for him was horribly real
and never to be joked about.

1528
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:19,190
He developed a paternal attitude
toward the newer and younger soldiers,

1529
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,350
a relationship devoid of patronage,

1530
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:25,130
but essentially one of
kindly understanding.

1531
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,320
He spoke to me about it when the,
I thanked him for his help.

1532
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:33,500
I admit I'm dead windy sir.

1533
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:38,710
His extraordinary honesty with himself
from the rest of the platoon forbade him

1534
01:39:38,711 --> 01:39:43,711
to attempt to hide the fact raven
and overtaxed as nervous and physical

1535
01:39:44,591 --> 01:39:48,640
resources long before we
arrived in Hoven woods.

1536
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:49,973
Yeah.

1537
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:51,820
After two days in the position,

1538
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,410
he came to me late one evening and
asked my permission to report sick the

1539
01:39:56,410 --> 01:39:57,243
following morning.

1540
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,740
I suppose I should and
physically have refused,

1541
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:05,820
but something made me hesitate and avoid
dealing directly with the situation.

1542
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:10,920
I said simply, all right, raven,
but do come see me before you leave.

1543
01:40:13,010 --> 01:40:13,843
He didn't come.

1544
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:18,080
The matter was never again mentioned.

1545
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:24,360
I can only surmise the struggle which
raged in his mind all that night while he

1546
01:40:24,641 --> 01:40:26,950
crouched in his water log,
slit trench,

1547
01:40:26,951 --> 01:40:29,920
peering into the sinister
darkness of the wood.

1548
01:40:32,490 --> 01:40:33,960
I do know,
however,

1549
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:39,110
that in Hoven would a considerable moral
triumph over stark horror was achieved

1550
01:40:40,741 --> 01:40:41,670
by a good man,

1551
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:46,860
unequipped equipped for nature
on a cooked by nature for war

1552
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,600
in my view,
the bravest of the brave.

1553
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:59,400
So that guy rave and had been through
all this stuff and just barely held the

1554
01:40:59,591 --> 01:41:04,390
line. And finally he was going to break.
Finally he was going to break and he,

1555
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:08,950
and he comes to city Jerry and says,
Hey, I'm, I'm good to go sick tomorrow,

1556
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,600
Cindy. Jerry says, okay, come and see
me before you go. He doesn't come back.

1557
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,520
It doesn't come back to him,
doesn't go sick.

1558
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:16,423
Okay,

1559
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:22,210
back to the book.
Infantry warfare is wretched business.

1560
01:41:23,260 --> 01:41:27,310
It makes physical and emotional demands
on participants that run contrary to all

1561
01:41:27,311 --> 01:41:28,300
human instinct.

1562
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:33,760
The strong minority must
quietly help the weak majority.

1563
01:41:35,020 --> 01:41:37,300
To me,
that is the essence of good teamwork.

1564
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:40,630
And that jewel in the
crown of the British army,

1565
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:45,750
the regimental system is the strong
foundation upon which we all knowingly or

1566
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:47,770
unknowingly relied.

1567
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:57,280
So there's gonna be some people
that deal with it better than others

1568
01:41:58,900 --> 01:41:59,750
and you've got to help them.

1569
01:42:03,700 --> 01:42:08,700
Here's the situation.
They set up early warning flares,

1570
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:14,090
so we'll trip wires in case due to to
notify them if the enemy's moving down one

1571
01:42:15,490 --> 01:42:18,900
of their flanks.
And here we go back to the book.

1572
01:42:18,901 --> 01:42:20,130
After about 10 minutes had passed,

1573
01:42:20,131 --> 01:42:23,370
we heard the popping of mortars behind
Hoven village and a concentration of

1574
01:42:23,371 --> 01:42:27,990
bombs fell in the fields where we had
laid the flares suddenly are left flank,

1575
01:42:27,991 --> 01:42:31,800
was vividly illuminated as
flare after flare ignited.

1576
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:37,120
Knowing little about these flares, we had
laid them with the trip wires to talk.

1577
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:43,230
How do we allow to degree of slack? The
flares would not have ignited my fault.

1578
01:42:44,310 --> 01:42:45,300
I should have known,

1579
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:50,310
had to throw a little extreme
ownership from Sydney,

1580
01:42:50,311 --> 01:42:52,020
Jerry and therefore y'all sure.

1581
01:42:56,410 --> 01:43:01,410
Now he's talking about the attitudes
of the soldiers and how soldiers,

1582
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:04,000
you know,
there was a claim,

1583
01:43:04,001 --> 01:43:07,510
he read an article years after the
war that said that people, you know,

1584
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:11,020
people became brutal from the,
from the war.

1585
01:43:13,240 --> 01:43:18,100
And here's what he says back to the book
does a war brutalize one can only speak

1586
01:43:18,101 --> 01:43:20,050
from personal experience,
but I think not.

1587
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,440
Certainly no soldier of
mine was made brutal.

1588
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:28,590
Rather the opposite war developed an 18
platoon consideration for comrades and

1589
01:43:30,341 --> 01:43:33,580
humanity towards civilians
and prisoners of war.

1590
01:43:34,780 --> 01:43:39,460
I was proud of my soldiers then and
this sentiment has increased with the

1591
01:43:39,461 --> 01:43:40,450
passing of years.

1592
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:46,360
I would not suggest that the naturally
brutal might not find in Warren outlet

1593
01:43:46,361 --> 01:43:48,400
for their brutality.
However,

1594
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:52,070
that ward is not brutalize
the type of decent men,

1595
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:57,740
the type of decent and fair minded young
English men whom I had the very great

1596
01:43:57,741 --> 01:43:58,820
honor to command.

1597
01:44:00,270 --> 01:44:02,940
We were not an aggressive
generation of fact,

1598
01:44:02,941 --> 01:44:06,540
which may explain my failure to understand
some present day attitudes and the

1599
01:44:06,570 --> 01:44:10,440
armed services, particularly in the
Royal Marines and the parachute regimen.

1600
01:44:12,190 --> 01:44:12,910
Okay.

1601
01:44:12,910 --> 01:44:17,910
Possibly a degree of personal aggression
is appropriate and troops are come who

1602
01:44:17,921 --> 01:44:22,660
are committed to battle for comparatively
short periods like the marines and the

1603
01:44:22,661 --> 01:44:27,661
Paris when the success of an operation
depends on ultra rapid action.

1604
01:44:28,660 --> 01:44:32,950
However, in my experience,
troops lose personal aggression.

1605
01:44:32,951 --> 01:44:37,010
After about two months in battle,
after three months,

1606
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:39,500
they acquire a mature compassion,

1607
01:44:39,620 --> 01:44:42,980
which in no way detracts from
their authentic of capability.

1608
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:46,370
They simply know a lot more about war.

1609
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:47,910
Okay.

1610
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:52,450
I would suggest that personal aggression
should not be confused with authentic

1611
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:57,490
of spirit based on professional
competence and experience.

1612
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:04,340
Interesting.
Take that aggression that you can maintain

1613
01:45:06,240 --> 01:45:09,140
if you,
it's not going to last forever and,

1614
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:11,670
and then you're going to have to

1615
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:17,660
fall back on duty and,

1616
01:45:17,670 --> 01:45:20,640
and that mature compassion,

1617
01:45:21,060 --> 01:45:23,310
which isn't taken away from
their offensive capability.

1618
01:45:29,730 --> 01:45:30,563
Interesting.

1619
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:39,550
Back to the book on the 11th of January,
we returned to the south. Fine. Yeah.

1620
01:45:39,670 --> 01:45:44,440
Just to go back to that one piece
right there. Dichotomy, leadership.

1621
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,140
There's a dichotomy and everything and uh,
you know,

1622
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:52,510
obviously I'm a big proponent of being
aggressive and I also always talk about

1623
01:45:52,511 --> 01:45:54,340
the fact that there is such a
thing as being too aggressive.

1624
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,270
You're running to your
death. No, not a good idea.

1625
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:00,211
Not a good idea.

1626
01:46:00,211 --> 01:46:04,410
And there's probably a good chance that
when he talks about people after two

1627
01:46:04,411 --> 01:46:09,180
months of combat, everyone
starts to develop a different
type of attitude. Also,

1628
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:13,220
the people that were ultra
aggressive didn't make it like the,

1629
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:16,950
like the leader that he talked about that
was strutting around the guy was ultra

1630
01:46:16,951 --> 01:46:18,940
aggressive, didn't care about
anything, and he's dead. Yeah,

1631
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:23,220
so there's a balance you got to have.
That's the dichotomy of leadership.

1632
01:46:24,060 --> 01:46:28,860
That's why the dichotomy of leadership is
so important and so hard to understand.

1633
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,810
Back to the book, on the day after the
battalion was relieved in Hoeven Woods,

1634
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:39,420
someone I suspect,
I suspect it was the adjutant,

1635
01:46:40,100 --> 01:46:45,100
Tim Watson decided that I should
enjoy 48 hours on leave in Antwerp.

1636
01:46:47,070 --> 01:46:50,220
I was overjoyed.
The large hotel,

1637
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:54,630
although faded, we're still plush and
filled with officers, including women,

1638
01:46:54,970 --> 01:46:59,970
ATS officers from the various base unit
stationed in the city dressed as I left

1639
01:47:00,891 --> 01:47:03,860
the battlefield.
I was both disheveled and soiled,

1640
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:07,850
surrounded by the residents,
many of whom were in service dress.

1641
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:10,880
I could not have felt
more isolated and lonely.

1642
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:15,920
So he's getting some leave time, but he's
showing up off the battlefield. Grimy.

1643
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:22,850
My first visit was to a magnificent white
marble gentleman's hairdressing salon

1644
01:47:23,030 --> 01:47:24,260
in the basement of a hotel.

1645
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:25,240
Okay?

1646
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:26,080
Without a word.

1647
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:30,340
The Barbara washed and rinsed my hair
twice before touching it with his precious

1648
01:47:30,341 --> 01:47:31,630
scissors and clippers.

1649
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:36,580
I remember the feeling of
wellbeing as climbing the stairs.

1650
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:40,300
I returned to my room
next,

1651
01:47:40,301 --> 01:47:42,430
I took three very hot baths,

1652
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:45,520
one after the other to
rid myself of grime,

1653
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:48,190
both physical and emotional.

1654
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:54,320
I think I must have slept for
14 hours before I rose shaved,

1655
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:57,680
took another bath and
decided to explore the city.

1656
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:03,840
Uh, rather creased battle
dress was my best suit.

1657
01:48:04,140 --> 01:48:07,440
And in this I descended the
main staircase into the lounge,

1658
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:09,690
which was filled with
the resident officers,

1659
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,500
all of whom seem to be
annoyingly self assured.

1660
01:48:15,630 --> 01:48:17,350
I met a barrier.
Okay.

1661
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:23,300
I had walked out of a world that I knew
into one where I was desperately unsure

1662
01:48:23,611 --> 01:48:27,300
of myself
away from the battlefield.

1663
01:48:29,070 --> 01:48:30,990
This world,
I had no place for me.

1664
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,550
I did not go out to lunch,
go to nightclubs,

1665
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:40,640
or meet the girls who were everywhere
seem to be canvassing for these

1666
01:48:41,461 --> 01:48:42,330
establishments.

1667
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:49,030
I had wandered too far into dark and
smokey battlefields across the sticks to

1668
01:48:49,461 --> 01:48:54,410
find solace or comfort in the bright
lights behind the blackout curtains of

1669
01:48:54,411 --> 01:48:55,244
Antwerp.

1670
01:48:57,050 --> 01:49:01,160
I longed to return to the
battalion and to 18 platoon,

1671
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:03,350
which without my knowing it

1672
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:04,640
okay

1673
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:09,030
had become my home
with a light heart,

1674
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:10,950
a clean body,
flesh,

1675
01:49:10,980 --> 01:49:15,570
freshly laundered clothes and
refreshed by hours of unbroken sleep.

1676
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:20,780
I gladly climbed into the three ton
truck that took me there years later.

1677
01:49:22,521 --> 01:49:25,070
I found the same problem
after I left the army.

1678
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:31,640
Antwerp had been a small taste of the
real world and as anyone who has served

1679
01:49:31,641 --> 01:49:35,900
with good soldiers on grim battlefields,
we'll confirm afterwards.

1680
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:39,860
Real life never seems real again.

1681
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:46,650
Later.
There was no 18 platoon to slink back to.

1682
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:47,510
Okay.

1683
01:49:47,510 --> 01:49:47,990
And without a

1684
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:51,860
will loving wife,
it would have proved in tolerable.

1685
01:49:56,520 --> 01:50:01,130
Well, that's the feeling that that we get.

1686
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,080
Yeah.

1687
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,410
When you get done doing that job.

1688
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:08,520
Okay.

1689
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:12,930
And real life. Never seen. He
was real again in comparison.

1690
01:50:17,250 --> 01:50:19,380
I know the vets that are
listening to understand that part.

1691
01:50:20,430 --> 01:50:24,360
Back to the book on 11 January,
we returned to the south of Holland.

1692
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:29,400
This time to gang gang lit snow lay on
deeply frozen ground and life for the

1693
01:50:32,131 --> 01:50:36,960
intro and life for the infantry. Manning
their slit trenches became unbearable

1694
01:50:38,620 --> 01:50:42,670
again. The Battalion Front was
extensive. D Company was in reserve,

1695
01:50:42,671 --> 01:50:45,280
closed close to battalion
headquarters on the edge of town.

1696
01:50:46,240 --> 01:50:51,040
Fortunately gang out was on a reverse
slope which allowed us to move freely

1697
01:50:51,041 --> 01:50:54,910
during daylight hours.
The cold was penetrating.

1698
01:50:55,300 --> 01:51:00,300
The oil in our automatic weapons froze
and until antifreeze lubricants were

1699
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:02,920
issued,
our brands were useless.

1700
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:09,040
Holding a wide front with large gaps
between our company positions necessitated

1701
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:12,550
putting out many standing patrols,
particularly at night.

1702
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:16,860
The privation suffered
by these small patrols.

1703
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:20,640
Usually a corporal and three or four
men were harder than the rest of us.

1704
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:26,600
Some had hallucinations and if you
were exact a evacuated suffering from

1705
01:51:26,601 --> 01:51:29,680
exposure,
keeping fit,

1706
01:51:29,830 --> 01:51:32,440
warm and clean became a great effort.

1707
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:38,140
Conversation dried up.
The platoon became quiet but never morose.

1708
01:51:39,400 --> 01:51:40,211
At one stage.

1709
01:51:40,211 --> 01:51:43,810
I decided they needed cheering up and I
wandered around the section post ready

1710
01:51:43,811 --> 01:51:47,820
to chat with all of them.
It was quite unnecessary.

1711
01:51:47,970 --> 01:51:49,800
I had wrongly judged their mood.

1712
01:51:51,260 --> 01:51:53,060
They just wanted to be left alone.

1713
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:05,500
Now there's a,
again by the book and read the book.

1714
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:10,420
There's a chaotic bottle battle at a
pace place called Cleve and after the

1715
01:52:10,421 --> 01:52:14,530
battle of cleave,
he kind of debriefs here back to the book.

1716
01:52:14,531 --> 01:52:18,430
What instructors at the school of infantry
would think about the fighting Cleve.

1717
01:52:18,431 --> 01:52:22,390
I shutter to think it resembled
no other battle. In my experience.

1718
01:52:22,570 --> 01:52:26,080
I have little control and it developed
into a section commanders battle.

1719
01:52:26,710 --> 01:52:31,420
Looking back over the years, it seems
military leave totally unprofessional,

1720
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:35,510
are real wild west shootout.
Tactically,

1721
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:39,650
the Germans had every advantage.
We were strung out in a long column,

1722
01:52:39,651 --> 01:52:44,300
a mid shattered buildings and piles
of rebels with the groups of parachute

1723
01:52:44,301 --> 01:52:46,130
troops attacking both sides.

1724
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:49,340
They could snipe at us
and engage with our,

1725
01:52:49,580 --> 01:52:53,390
with their spanned owls
from dozens of physicians,

1726
01:52:53,391 --> 01:52:55,730
totally hidden by piles of rubble.

1727
01:52:57,500 --> 01:53:01,550
They had the opportunity to concentrate
their counter attacks on the narrowest

1728
01:53:01,551 --> 01:53:04,400
of fronts but failed to do to do so,

1729
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:06,710
so they failed to focus their efforts.

1730
01:53:07,430 --> 01:53:09,920
I can only assume that we had
the psychological advantage,

1731
01:53:10,490 --> 01:53:14,780
the circumstances being so chaotic and
disorganized, perhaps being Germans,

1732
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:18,560
they cannot overcome their instinct
for organization and tidiness.

1733
01:53:20,620 --> 01:53:21,071
In the end,

1734
01:53:21,071 --> 01:53:26,071
they departed possibly and discussed
leaving us undisputed victors

1735
01:53:33,690 --> 01:53:34,980
on another attack.

1736
01:53:35,250 --> 01:53:39,750
The Germans at this point are
retreating and they can see that they're

1737
01:53:39,751 --> 01:53:40,500
retreating.

1738
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:43,680
Fearing that the retreating parachute
troops would make a stand on the edge of

1739
01:53:43,681 --> 01:53:44,011
the wood.

1740
01:53:44,011 --> 01:53:49,011
I increased the rate of advance joining
Lance Corporal Porteous in the forward

1741
01:53:49,381 --> 01:53:52,620
section running across the level crossing,

1742
01:53:52,621 --> 01:53:56,490
I suddenly found myself face to face with
a German platoon complete with the MG

1743
01:53:56,491 --> 01:53:58,980
34 fortunately,

1744
01:53:59,120 --> 01:54:03,210
the gun was mounted on a tripod which
was unusual and could not be traversed in

1745
01:54:03,211 --> 01:54:07,380
our direction from a drainage channel.
On the left of the road,

1746
01:54:07,530 --> 01:54:09,030
a parachute has leaped up.

1747
01:54:09,031 --> 01:54:14,031
Swathed and Camouflage Vale pointing
is Schweizer at me from about 10 yards

1748
01:54:14,311 --> 01:54:18,690
range. He fired a whole
magazine of about 30 rounds.

1749
01:54:19,700 --> 01:54:22,590
It was like watching a
slow running silent movie.

1750
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:24,690
I didn't hear the chatter
of the [inaudible],

1751
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:27,840
but I do remember seeing this
stream of empty cartridges.

1752
01:54:27,900 --> 01:54:30,300
Cartridge cases fly
from the German machine.

1753
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:33,900
Gun Miracles do indeed happen.

1754
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:37,440
One nine millimeter bullet
went through my baret,

1755
01:54:38,610 --> 01:54:42,000
missing my head literally
by a hair's width.

1756
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:46,440
Another went under the
Epilep of my jacket,

1757
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:49,470
penetrating the webbing or cross brace.

1758
01:54:49,830 --> 01:54:52,770
The webbing cross brace of my equipment
in grazing. My right shoulder,

1759
01:54:53,490 --> 01:54:58,020
a third bullet ricocheted off the
surface of the road and disintegrated the

1760
01:54:58,021 --> 01:55:00,750
jacket. Finally, lodging in
the palm of my right hand.

1761
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:03,960
Then came the anticlimax.

1762
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:09,420
The German looked at me in amazement
through way as sir and I with a shrug of

1763
01:55:09,421 --> 01:55:11,160
the shoulders.
He surrendered.

1764
01:55:13,050 --> 01:55:16,890
My natural elation was
short lived behind me.

1765
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:20,610
Lay Lance corporal Porteous
shot through the heart.

1766
01:55:23,650 --> 01:55:27,400
Some of the German platoon ran away across
the open fields to our left and were

1767
01:55:27,401 --> 01:55:29,020
cut down by rapid fire.

1768
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:33,010
Bren gun by Sergeant Kingston Section,

1769
01:55:34,060 --> 01:55:36,550
which now wind the railway
track to the left of the road.

1770
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:41,110
The remainder of the enemy came towards
us over the level crossing with their

1771
01:55:41,111 --> 01:55:45,030
hands raised.
We took 57 prisoners.

1772
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:49,950
Yeah.

1773
01:55:49,950 --> 01:55:53,550
Now they're moving along and they are
clearing some cottages and they get to

1774
01:55:53,551 --> 01:55:56,250
this one cottage filled
with rough wooden bunks.

1775
01:55:56,251 --> 01:55:58,530
It it obviously served
as an air raid shelter.

1776
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:00,720
The house having been
found clear of enemy.

1777
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:05,190
Jack Lee was off his guard as he descended
the steps suddenly from under a pile

1778
01:56:05,191 --> 01:56:07,860
of blankets lept the
fanatical German paratrooper.

1779
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:12,360
The only fanatical German paratrooper
we encountered the entire battle.

1780
01:56:12,810 --> 01:56:16,290
A large man, he sees Jack around the
throat in an attempt to strangle him.

1781
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:20,250
Private fluid rose to
the challenge in a bound.

1782
01:56:20,251 --> 01:56:25,251
He was down the steps and with a mighty
lunge transfixed the German on his band

1783
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:28,270
net,
a brave lad.

1784
01:56:28,420 --> 01:56:32,470
He undoubtedly saved Lance Corporal Lee's
life just eight days before losing his

1785
01:56:32,471 --> 01:56:33,304
own.

1786
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:38,730
The German was indeed unlucky as it
was the only occasion throughout the

1787
01:56:38,731 --> 01:56:42,420
campaign on which 18 paltunes
bayonets were bloodied.

1788
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:46,260
We usually use them to open food cans,

1789
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:52,500
having checked the platoon positions
and arcs of fire for the brands.

1790
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:53,880
Exhaustion hit me.

1791
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,350
Yeah.

1792
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:59,400
I fell into a deep sleep during
the evening. A senior officer,

1793
01:56:59,401 --> 01:57:01,770
I understand it was either to
brigade or divisional commander,

1794
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,430
came out to my company position
when he asked to speak to me.

1795
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:08,250
Sergeant Kingston refuse
to have me wakened.

1796
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,850
I'm sure that Jim was the
most diplomatic about it,

1797
01:57:12,030 --> 01:57:15,450
but it says much for our visitors,
humanity that he let it go by

1798
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:25,490
another attack.

1799
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:31,020
A and c companies were unleashed
and passing be company,

1800
01:57:31,080 --> 01:57:34,230
secure their objectives
against some opposition.

1801
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:40,040
There was now our turn d company advanced
across the flat open fields down the

1802
01:57:40,351 --> 01:57:41,400
left hand side

1803
01:57:42,850 --> 01:57:47,850
of the main road into Zam 10 it's the
name of the city or village casualties

1804
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:54,490
from the preceding companies in the
opposition lay all around about 300 yards

1805
01:57:54,491 --> 01:57:59,370
short of the town were
extremely accurately engaged
by a battery of one oh five

1806
01:57:59,371 --> 01:58:02,560
s some of their shells
exploded on the hard surface.

1807
01:58:02,561 --> 01:58:07,561
The road earsplitting detonations and
frightening fragmentation pieces of shell

1808
01:58:07,751 --> 01:58:09,970
casing hummed in wind around us.

1809
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:14,500
One twirling piece in bedded itself with
a thud into the trunk of a tree a few

1810
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:19,000
inches from my right ear was the only
time in the whole campaign when I

1811
01:58:19,001 --> 01:58:21,040
regretted throwing away my steel helmet.

1812
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:28,260
I think it was the accuracy
and the intense noise of
the showing that caused it.

1813
01:58:28,510 --> 01:58:31,150
One of 18 platoons,
lance corporals,

1814
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:36,100
a big man who had served honorably
since market garden went to pieces.

1815
01:58:37,330 --> 01:58:40,480
There was a pathetic sight
and to everyone's credit,

1816
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:42,820
he was removed from the battle.

1817
01:58:44,590 --> 01:58:47,860
He had passed his limit and
nothing more can be said,

1818
01:58:51,970 --> 01:58:56,620
so you don't know. These guys are brave
at one moment and then a week, a month,

1819
01:58:56,621 --> 01:58:59,890
two months, four months.
They can't do it anymore.

1820
01:59:04,330 --> 01:59:05,163
Okay?

1821
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:08,750
They get across the Rhine.
Now they're fully in Germany.

1822
01:59:09,620 --> 01:59:12,770
There's a little bit of a lull
in the fighting back to the book.

1823
01:59:12,890 --> 01:59:16,130
Early one morning while we were waiting
for our supporting armor to arrive,

1824
01:59:16,131 --> 01:59:17,030
our pod Dre,

1825
01:59:17,150 --> 01:59:22,150
John Williams drove a receipt us after
wandering around the platoon for a chat.

1826
01:59:22,460 --> 01:59:26,060
He suggested he suggested that
we should go for a short stroll.

1827
01:59:26,930 --> 01:59:31,880
I had now been commanding 18 platoon
for over eight months and I suspect that

1828
01:59:32,300 --> 01:59:36,560
our adjutant Tim Watson,
a kindly soul,

1829
01:59:36,770 --> 01:59:39,440
had asked him to find
out what shape I was in.

1830
01:59:42,490 --> 01:59:45,760
We had not gone far into the next
field when he came across some grizzly

1831
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:46,594
remnants.

1832
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:51,100
One of our artillery shells must have
exploded right at the feet of a German

1833
01:59:51,101 --> 01:59:53,050
soldier who had been digging.
A slit.

1834
01:59:53,051 --> 01:59:56,650
Trench is splintered and twisted.

1835
01:59:56,651 --> 02:00:01,651
Spade lay beside laid by the side of
that half dug trench beside which was a

1836
02:00:03,401 --> 02:00:04,570
small shell hole.

1837
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:09,440
He had been disintegrated into
small pieces of flesh and bone,

1838
02:00:09,441 --> 02:00:11,180
which lay scattered all over the field.

1839
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:14,870
Had I been on my own,

1840
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:18,740
I would no doubt have shuttered and
quickly departed from this horror

1841
02:00:21,060 --> 02:00:24,750
draped over a wire fence nearby.
Lay a parachute,

1842
02:00:24,900 --> 02:00:26,520
which are extraordinarily brave.

1843
02:00:26,521 --> 02:00:30,240
Padre spread out as a shroud
on the cold and damp grass.

1844
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,050
Then stooping.
He walked around the field,

1845
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:40,590
a lonely figure reverently picking
up every piece of that poor soldier.

1846
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,240
To my shame,
I stood and watched him.

1847
02:00:47,610 --> 02:00:49,050
I lack the courage to help

1848
02:00:53,510 --> 02:00:57,620
somewhere beneath those flat damp
fields just north of the Ryan.

1849
02:00:58,310 --> 02:01:02,270
That pallette it. Pathetic
Bundle. Must still lie.

1850
02:01:12,530 --> 02:01:15,790
Now they're an attack again,

1851
02:01:17,500 --> 02:01:21,760
but it seems like things are going
their way and we're going, he's,

1852
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:24,580
he's kind of giving a brief to his,
to his runner.

1853
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:29,680
When all of a sudden he hears yelling
back to the books or they're charging us.

1854
02:01:29,770 --> 02:01:30,603
Sure enough,

1855
02:01:30,970 --> 02:01:35,740
from about 150 yards ahead of wealth
spread outline of about 20 Germans were

1856
02:01:35,741 --> 02:01:39,760
putting in a bayonet charge.
Brave lads,

1857
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:42,580
they didn't stand a chance.
Okay.

1858
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,800
I gave no orders except ceasefire,

1859
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:52,270
not one God within 75 yards of us,

1860
02:01:54,170 --> 02:01:55,130
a few minutes later,

1861
02:01:55,290 --> 02:01:59,120
a possession of Germans with stretchers
and a huge red flag emerged from the

1862
02:01:59,121 --> 02:02:00,080
village behind.

1863
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:01,030
Yeah.

1864
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:03,700
When they were close to their casualties,
they hesitated.

1865
02:02:03,820 --> 02:02:08,230
So I stood up and waved them on,
all wore on arms stretcher bearers,

1866
02:02:08,560 --> 02:02:11,680
and they moved across our front
collecting their dead and wounded

1867
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:16,460
when they had finished their
task of mercy. One of them,

1868
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:20,900
I think he must have been a German
medical officer turned and saluted in our

1869
02:02:20,901 --> 02:02:21,734
direction.

1870
02:02:22,740 --> 02:02:23,390
Okay.

1871
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:26,390
I returned the salute
and with that gesture,

1872
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:30,170
the tiny battle of Cinderella ended.

1873
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:32,113
Yeah.

1874
02:02:32,180 --> 02:02:36,050
In Bremen, little over a month
later, one of our stretcher bearers,

1875
02:02:36,170 --> 02:02:38,420
Lance Corporal Jay Stevens,

1876
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:42,830
was killed by a German grenade as he
went to tend to wounded German soldier.

1877
02:02:44,390 --> 02:02:49,390
18 platoon remembering syndrome were
justifiably outraged by such on soldierly

1878
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:51,674
behavior.

1879
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,073
Okay.

1880
02:03:00,910 --> 02:03:04,780
There is a mathematical formula.
Aggression increases.

1881
02:03:04,781 --> 02:03:07,480
The further one goes behind the lines.

1882
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:12,870
Opposing infantry with few exceptions
like the SS are joined by a natural bond

1883
02:03:13,511 --> 02:03:14,740
of mutual compassion,

1884
02:03:14,741 --> 02:03:18,640
which few but the aristocracy of
the battlefield can understand

1885
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,030
the public influence,

1886
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:25,810
no doubt by writers with literally no
experience of battle have strange and

1887
02:03:25,811 --> 02:03:28,510
sometimes silly ideas about
what makes a good soldier.

1888
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:33,550
Ill informed television programs
have added to this misunderstanding.

1889
02:03:34,390 --> 02:03:38,230
Few professions can be have
been so misleadingly caricature.

1890
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:39,850
Okay.

1891
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:43,060
I had,
I been asked at the time before August,

1892
02:03:43,060 --> 02:03:46,390
1944 to list the personal characteristics
which go to make a good infantry

1893
02:03:46,391 --> 02:03:50,650
soldier. My reply would indeed have
been wider than mark wide of the mark.

1894
02:03:51,820 --> 02:03:56,110
Like most I no doubt would have suggested
only masculine ones like aggression,

1895
02:03:56,111 --> 02:04:00,850
physical stamina. A hunting instinct
instinct and competitive nature.

1896
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:02,060
Okay,

1897
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:06,590
how wrong I would have been,
I would now suggest the following,

1898
02:04:06,740 --> 02:04:08,840
firstly,
sufferance

1899
02:04:10,990 --> 02:04:14,230
without which one could not survive.

1900
02:04:14,231 --> 02:04:17,560
So he's listing what he thinks the most
important characteristics for for an

1901
02:04:17,561 --> 02:04:20,920
infantry soldier are. The first one
is sufferance, the ability to suffer.

1902
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,151
Secondly,

1903
02:04:23,151 --> 02:04:28,151
a quiet mind which enables a soldier to
live in harmony with his fellows through

1904
02:04:28,521 --> 02:04:31,940
all sorts of difficulties and
sometimes under dreadful conditions.

1905
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:37,980
As in a closed monastic existence,
there is simply no

1906
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,950
room for the assertive or acrimonious.

1907
02:04:43,220 --> 02:04:45,830
Thirdly, below, no less important.

1908
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:51,070
A sense of the ridiculous which helps
us soldiers surmount the unacceptable

1909
02:04:53,740 --> 02:04:57,310
add to these are reasonable standard
of physical fitness and a dedicated

1910
02:04:57,311 --> 02:05:00,970
professional competence.
And you have a soldier for all seasons.

1911
02:05:03,020 --> 02:05:06,650
None of the soldiers are
ntls who made 18 platoon.

1912
02:05:06,830 --> 02:05:11,660
What it was resembled the
characters portrayed in most
books and films about war.

1913
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:14,340
All quiet,

1914
02:05:14,580 --> 02:05:19,580
sensible on assuming and
some by any standard.

1915
02:05:20,770 --> 02:05:21,603
We're heroes.

1916
02:05:23,530 --> 02:05:28,300
If I now had to select a team for a
dangerous mission and my choice was

1917
02:05:28,301 --> 02:05:32,830
restricted to stars of
the sports field or poets,

1918
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,970
I would own hesitatingly
recruit from the ladder.

1919
02:05:45,390 --> 02:05:49,530
Very interesting.
And I mean,

1920
02:05:49,531 --> 02:05:53,340
obviously you have to put this in
the context of, of his time, but

1921
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,313
okay.

1922
02:05:55,640 --> 02:05:59,360
There's no doubt that,
I mean,

1923
02:05:59,361 --> 02:06:02,510
you get a sports star,
especially these days,

1924
02:06:03,050 --> 02:06:07,880
those guys that are getting paid 2030
$40 million a year to play a game,

1925
02:06:09,050 --> 02:06:13,610
they're, they're probably not going to
be the best at suffering in a trench.

1926
02:06:15,950 --> 02:06:16,783
Okay.

1927
02:06:16,930 --> 02:06:21,880
Interesting. And I, and I think
the key point of that is what is,

1928
02:06:21,881 --> 02:06:26,490
going back to what he talks about earlier,
is he someone that can think, hmm.

1929
02:06:26,860 --> 02:06:31,150
Someone that can think
someone that is not trapped

1930
02:06:32,680 --> 02:06:35,200
in, in thinking the same
thoughts as everyone else,

1931
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:40,590
which certainly an artist or a poet has
to be outside the box of normal fought.

1932
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:46,690
Otherwise they become, they
don't become that. Right.

1933
02:06:51,440 --> 02:06:52,000
Okay.

1934
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,440
In this situation.

1935
02:06:55,540 --> 02:07:00,540
His platoon is kind of pin down
and there's an air raid shelter,

1936
02:07:02,440 --> 02:07:06,370
which has someone in it is firing
these things called a panzer Faust,

1937
02:07:06,371 --> 02:07:07,060
which is like a,

1938
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:12,060
it's kind of like a bazooka or like an
RPG looking thing and he sees where it's

1939
02:07:13,151 --> 02:07:15,630
coming from and he sees that
it's this shelter. Yeah,

1940
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:19,060
but he doesn't know who's in the shelter.
Here we go back to the COO.

1941
02:07:19,090 --> 02:07:20,290
Who else was in the shelter?

1942
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:25,560
Women and children's sheltering more
enemy soldiers with more pounds or Faust

1943
02:07:25,751 --> 02:07:26,700
and spanned o's.

1944
02:07:28,530 --> 02:07:32,230
We were in a vulnerable situation and
it was no good pushing forward and

1945
02:07:32,231 --> 02:07:36,110
ignoring the Metis lurking
inside that shelter. I could have

1946
02:07:36,110 --> 02:07:38,770
sent two or three men to clear it.
However,

1947
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:43,890
experience it taught me that when clearing
sellers that the first man sent in is

1948
02:07:44,141 --> 02:07:45,460
invariably killed.

1949
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:46,880
Okay.

1950
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:51,680
Instead, concentrated fire was poured
into the entrance, included get pee out,

1951
02:07:51,681 --> 02:07:52,514
bomb.

1952
02:07:53,110 --> 02:07:53,590
Okay.

1953
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:54,161
Around us.

1954
02:07:54,161 --> 02:07:59,161
The battle still raged and no opportunity
arose for Medians for me to inspect

1955
02:07:59,201 --> 02:08:01,780
the consequences of an awful decision.

1956
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:05,180
Nevertheless,

1957
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:10,390
my duty was to win battles and not to
gamble with the lives of my soldiers by

1958
02:08:10,581 --> 02:08:15,380
fussing over too sensitive a conscience.
So there you go.

1959
02:08:15,381 --> 02:08:16,370
There's a dichotomy for you.

1960
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:19,250
If the one hand he's looking at the
shelter thinking there might be women and

1961
02:08:19,251 --> 02:08:20,030
kids in there,

1962
02:08:20,030 --> 02:08:22,610
but at this moment in time he doesn't
have time to find out and doesn't have

1963
02:08:22,611 --> 02:08:25,190
time to,
to take the most cautious route.

1964
02:08:25,370 --> 02:08:29,780
So they hammer it with machine gun
fire and some some anti tank rounds.

1965
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:33,740
He never even goes to look.
Hmm. But he knows that he can't,

1966
02:08:34,430 --> 02:08:39,110
his duty is to win battles and he can't
dilly dally because he has a sensitive

1967
02:08:39,111 --> 02:08:40,610
conscious doesn't work.

1968
02:08:47,240 --> 02:08:50,510
Back to the book.
Bremerhaven was our final objective.

1969
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:52,000
Yeah.

1970
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,460
It was 5th of May,

1971
02:08:54,460 --> 02:08:57,460
1945 19 days before my 21st birthday.

1972
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:00,950
Thinking about what you were doing,
you were twins.

1973
02:09:02,150 --> 02:09:05,960
That's why it's so interesting.
Ready to break out.

1974
02:09:07,070 --> 02:09:07,340
Okay.

1975
02:09:07,340 --> 02:09:08,690
We were concentrated at,

1976
02:09:08,691 --> 02:09:13,691
we'll stat about 20 miles north
of Bremen when the end came,

1977
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:18,930
and by the end,
I mean the end of the war,

1978
02:09:20,170 --> 02:09:24,150
129 brigades order was
stand down and splice.

1979
02:09:24,151 --> 02:09:27,410
The main brace,
which is a military,

1980
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,010
is actually a navy term splice.
The main brace me,

1981
02:09:30,030 --> 02:09:34,280
it's like drinking light is lit.
You can drink the war's over.

1982
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:38,930
I had just given orders for our small
part in the Brigades move forward against

1983
02:09:38,931 --> 02:09:43,070
15 panzer division,
one of the famous Africa core formations.

1984
02:09:43,820 --> 02:09:44,330
Yeah.

1985
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:48,740
In 1983 Jim Kingston gave
me his copy of those orders,

1986
02:09:48,860 --> 02:09:50,630
which he had kept all those years

1987
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:53,980
reaction to the end of the war,

1988
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:58,330
like aggression increased
further behind the lines.

1989
02:09:58,331 --> 02:09:59,230
One went,

1990
02:10:00,120 --> 02:10:00,350
okay.

1991
02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:02,810
The natural aristocracy
of the battlefield,

1992
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:06,080
the infantry having fired a photo,
joy,

1993
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:09,880
a very lights curled up and slept.

1994
02:10:11,370 --> 02:10:15,390
We had learned too much to
indulge in shallow demonstrations,

1995
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:19,260
so everyone's all fireworks and getting
crazy. These guys are like, cool,

1996
02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:21,000
I'm going to sleep.
Yeah.

1997
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:22,330
Okay.

1998
02:10:22,330 --> 02:10:25,570
Since July, we had come a long
way from the Normandy beach head.

1999
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:27,010
Okay.

2000
02:10:27,010 --> 02:10:32,010
The battalion had lost 47 officers
and 1,260 and [inaudible] and private

2001
02:10:35,001 --> 02:10:36,800
soldiers killed or wounded

2002
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:42,560
after July 31st,

2003
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,740
1944 no member of 18
platoon was put on a charge.

2004
02:10:45,890 --> 02:10:47,900
No one went absent or deserted.

2005
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:49,360
Yeah.

2006
02:10:49,360 --> 02:10:53,170
Of the original 36 NCRS and
soldiers who had landed in Normandy,

2007
02:10:53,890 --> 02:10:55,900
only corporal Cheesman remained,

2008
02:10:59,570 --> 02:11:00,403
or one man,

2009
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:06,310
many came after them and lasted
a few days, weeks or months.

2010
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:10,100
Phew.
I was able to thank adequately,

2011
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:15,800
I doubt if any of them realized how
much I personally owed 18 platoon.

2012
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,370
Okay.

2013
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:20,280
When I joined them on 31st of July,

2014
02:11:20,460 --> 02:11:22,920
I was naive and Gosh,

2015
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:29,400
due to a narrow upbringing except
for a passionate love of music,

2016
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:32,250
my intellect and emotions
were unstimulated.

2017
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:35,220
My achievement at school had been abysmal.

2018
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:39,390
My mind was undisciplined and
confidence in myself. Nil.

2019
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:45,410
This was rapidly swept away
probably within three weeks,

2020
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:50,090
certainly before we crossed
the CN on the 28th of August,

2021
02:11:51,720 --> 02:11:54,090
discovering an ability to
command a group of men,

2022
02:11:54,210 --> 02:11:58,620
some frightened and but wilderness
produced a new found confidence,

2023
02:11:58,621 --> 02:12:03,621
particularly since I seem to be able to
achieve it quietly and without acrimony

2024
02:12:03,930 --> 02:12:04,763
or foss,

2025
02:12:06,940 --> 02:12:10,990
having to improvise tactics to overcome
the shortcomings of battle school

2026
02:12:10,991 --> 02:12:15,310
training also helped. It proved
to me that in some circumstances,

2027
02:12:15,490 --> 02:12:20,290
older and more experienced deny others
older and more experienced than I could

2028
02:12:20,291 --> 02:12:24,190
be wrong.
I suspect that as an only child,

2029
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:27,430
I had been brought up in
too much off my elders.

2030
02:12:28,810 --> 02:12:29,390
Yeah,

2031
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:34,160
a new world. It opened before me.
Forethought and planning were demanded.

2032
02:12:34,340 --> 02:12:36,140
Imagination and instinct too.

2033
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:42,390
Was that apparently quiet
Normandy lane lethal,

2034
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:46,650
the intense Spandau fire
and mortaring along a dyke.

2035
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:49,050
Was it a prelude to an enemy's withdrawal?

2036
02:12:49,560 --> 02:12:52,260
Did the orchard in front
of the village hide 88

2037
02:12:53,370 --> 02:12:53,660
okay.

2038
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:58,660
My judgment and these things had proved
equal to better than most of them the

2039
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:01,340
most,
and it was the making of me.

2040
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:04,640
It also brought a few problems.

2041
02:13:04,910 --> 02:13:09,590
I'm now only able to plan and run
things in my way. As a result,

2042
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:11,210
I'm probably unemployable.

2043
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:13,290
Okay.

2044
02:13:13,290 --> 02:13:16,530
However, I would never wish
to change places with the shy,

2045
02:13:16,531 --> 02:13:20,490
hesitant boy whom circumstances
put in command of 18 we'll tune

2046
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:25,930
age 20 I was far too
young and inexperienced to
appreciate that an infantry

2047
02:13:25,931 --> 02:13:30,910
platoon was the finest command in the
army and that's the success or failure of

2048
02:13:30,911 --> 02:13:34,950
a so often lay solely in the
hands of a young officer.

2049
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:37,393
Okay.

2050
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:38,890
After careful reflection,

2051
02:13:39,100 --> 02:13:43,510
I doubt that at any time since the
war have I carried the burden of

2052
02:13:43,511 --> 02:13:47,980
responsibility that I bore
has a softball turn in battle.

2053
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:55,420
Wait, an army core division or
brigade was committed to battle.

2054
02:13:55,540 --> 02:13:59,320
It was the battalion company and platoon
commanders who took over the mantle of

2055
02:13:59,321 --> 02:14:02,650
responsibility from the generals
from the generals and brigadiers.

2056
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:03,930
Okay.

2057
02:14:03,930 --> 02:14:06,720
And close country forests
and street fighting.

2058
02:14:06,840 --> 02:14:09,000
The platoon commander became the linchpin.

2059
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:11,053
Yeah.

2060
02:14:11,180 --> 02:14:14,420
Only the company at platoon commanders,
particularly the ladder,

2061
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:17,810
we're able to have close
relationship with their soldiers,

2062
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:21,830
which is a prerequisite for
having above average success

2063
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:27,190
failure by one infantry company.
Correct. A divisional battle plan.

2064
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:28,790
Okay.

2065
02:14:28,790 --> 02:14:31,040
Conversely gallant success,

2066
02:14:31,280 --> 02:14:35,360
like be company at Zahn 10
underwrote the battalion's victory.

2067
02:14:37,480 --> 02:14:38,230
Again,

2068
02:14:38,230 --> 02:14:42,640
I would emphasize the analog with the
bond of professional respect between a

2069
02:14:42,641 --> 02:14:47,641
great conductor and the members of a
symphony orchestra without which a truly

2070
02:14:47,801 --> 02:14:49,570
great performance is not possible.

2071
02:14:51,250 --> 02:14:55,390
Outstanding performances cannot be
arranged in a concert promoters office.

2072
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:59,500
They're created by some magic by the
conductor and players and rehearsal and

2073
02:14:59,501 --> 02:15:02,660
performance.
Similarly,

2074
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:05,900
while senior commanders appreciated
the strengths and weaknesses of their

2075
02:15:05,901 --> 02:15:07,010
battalions and brigades,

2076
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:12,220
they could not extract a great performance
from the rifleman upon whom victory

2077
02:15:12,530 --> 02:15:13,363
dependent

2078
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:19,550
only the company or platoon commanders
supported by their NC o's could ensure

2079
02:15:19,551 --> 02:15:23,860
that
42 years on,

2080
02:15:24,580 --> 02:15:29,580
I get considerable satisfaction from 18
platoon successes more so than I got at

2081
02:15:29,951 --> 02:15:30,784
the time.

2082
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:42,820
So those were his thoughts in it.
And he's the wars now over

2083
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,113
and

2084
02:15:47,070 --> 02:15:50,520
a few days after the war ended.
Um,

2085
02:15:53,120 --> 02:15:55,940
well go to the book after
cholera inoculations,

2086
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:59,240
we were conducted into
the world of Frankenstein.

2087
02:16:00,260 --> 02:16:00,860
Yeah.

2088
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:04,310
Nothing had prepared us for
what we now experienced,

2089
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:06,080
not hill one 12,

2090
02:16:06,140 --> 02:16:10,730
not mount pin shown elsewhere or
Hoven could compete with this horror

2091
02:16:12,770 --> 02:16:14,360
before the incredulous eyes.

2092
02:16:14,361 --> 02:16:19,361
If 18 platoon spread over
acres of delightfully wooded
countryside was a factory

2093
02:16:20,331 --> 02:16:21,164
of death,

2094
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:28,520
emaciated bodies resembling wax effigies
of an alien race from a strange and

2095
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:29,950
distant planet

2096
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,600
filled many pits.

2097
02:16:33,940 --> 02:16:38,940
The stench of death and the site of such
highly industrialized human degradation

2098
02:16:40,510 --> 02:16:42,790
left my soldiers speechless.

2099
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:51,010
Private Macy d companies jeep
driver aptly summed it up.

2100
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:57,540
There is now no doubt that
we have fought a just war.

2101
02:17:03,480 --> 02:17:06,150
That's after they saw the
concentration camps. Obviously

2102
02:17:13,870 --> 02:17:14,561
back to the book.

2103
02:17:14,561 --> 02:17:19,450
Within a month of the war ending 21st
army group was required to supply junior

2104
02:17:19,451 --> 02:17:22,150
officers for the 14th army in Burma.

2105
02:17:24,070 --> 02:17:27,040
Lippi the commanding officer decided
that I should be one of them.

2106
02:17:27,310 --> 02:17:32,200
And by then being intent on a military
career, I was not inclined to argue.

2107
02:17:33,580 --> 02:17:36,940
I would gain useful
experience of jungle warfare,

2108
02:17:37,750 --> 02:17:39,130
of which I knew nothing about.

2109
02:17:41,370 --> 02:17:44,640
So they're getting orders still a
war going on in the Pacific. Oh,

2110
02:17:44,641 --> 02:17:48,330
you wrapped up portion from Normandy
through Germany. Through their surrender.

2111
02:17:49,410 --> 02:17:53,130
Guess, well, we need, we need
people to go to fight in Asia.

2112
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:55,920
We need people in Burma.

2113
02:17:57,450 --> 02:18:00,030
I was totally unprepared for the platoons,

2114
02:18:00,810 --> 02:18:05,810
for the emotions that were unleashed
immediately after I was deprived of 18

2115
02:18:07,021 --> 02:18:10,430
platoon,
has a jeep,

2116
02:18:10,431 --> 02:18:13,700
took me away from the battalion,

2117
02:18:14,090 --> 02:18:16,400
a ghastly desolation and Gulf to me,

2118
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:22,240
I felt like a small boy on his way to
a grim and unknown boarding school.

2119
02:18:24,270 --> 02:18:28,650
The pleasures of commanding 18 platoon
in peace time or being denied me.

2120
02:18:34,790 --> 02:18:35,623
And

2121
02:18:37,670 --> 02:18:42,400
it's interesting. So he's gets
pulled away from his platoon and,

2122
02:18:42,460 --> 02:18:47,460
and he goes into talk about what
happened to the guys that survived,

2123
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:53,510
that he knew. And I, I found this
part to be fascinating in the

2124
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:59,740
how these people went back to normal
life. Back to the book, Jim Kingston

2125
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:04,840
was demobilized in January,

2126
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:09,840
1946 and two months later he returned
to his civilian post with the Bristol

2127
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:11,290
Corporation,
Electricity Department,

2128
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:16,630
retired in 1975 never
married Doug proctor,

2129
02:19:16,631 --> 02:19:19,030
return home to his wife and
baby son and Nottingham.

2130
02:19:19,031 --> 02:19:24,031
And March of 1946 found the
transition from army to civilian life,

2131
02:19:24,131 --> 02:19:27,130
painless. Returning to his
accounting post in the coal.

2132
02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:35,210
Oh, in Cheesman. During the first
few days of his demobilization,

2133
02:19:36,140 --> 02:19:40,080
his wife died miserable. And for Lauren,

2134
02:19:40,081 --> 02:19:43,200
he returned to his old
job in Covent garden.

2135
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:48,030
And a few years later he met and
married Bella, who in his own words,

2136
02:19:49,530 --> 02:19:51,270
was a comfort and inspiration to him.

2137
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:57,750
Charles Raven joined the London
transport as a bus conductor

2138
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,050
later transferring to the clerical staff
and rose by hard work and study to be a

2139
02:20:04,051 --> 02:20:05,160
garage inspector.

2140
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:13,670
Joe Thomas and George Harish went
into the building trade industry in

2141
02:20:13,981 --> 02:20:14,814
Bridgewater.

2142
02:20:21,640 --> 02:20:22,690
Surprisingly,

2143
02:20:23,830 --> 02:20:28,830
just incredibly normal paths after
this incredibly not normal life.

2144
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:33,790
And,
and what happened to Sidney Jerry?

2145
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:37,810
So here's what happened to
Sidney. Jerry, back to the book,

2146
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:42,520
arriving in England on 9th of July,

2147
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:47,350
1945 I reported to the Holding Battalion
of the Hampshire Regiment at Westgate

2148
02:20:47,351 --> 02:20:51,040
on C and was immediately
sent on 28 days leave

2149
02:20:52,590 --> 02:20:56,100
after a night out in London with
three friends, also Burma bound.

2150
02:20:56,460 --> 02:20:58,740
I telephoned my parents
and found them away

2151
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:02,410
chopping them to Bognor Regis.

2152
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:05,020
I caught a train from
Waterloo and went to see them

2153
02:21:06,660 --> 02:21:11,660
staying at the same hotel as my parents
were flight Lieutenant Jack weatherleys

2154
02:21:12,781 --> 02:21:13,614
widow.

2155
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:19,020
Peggy and their three year old daughter
and we're staying at the same hotel as

2156
02:21:19,021 --> 02:21:20,760
his parents at once.

2157
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:24,210
A bond of deep understanding and
affection developed between us.

2158
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:26,583
In August,

2159
02:21:27,070 --> 02:21:32,070
an atom bomb was dropped and so at a
stroke my visit to Burma was rendered

2160
02:21:33,431 --> 02:21:34,264
pointless.

2161
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:38,780
So two in my heart was a military career.

2162
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:45,220
I soldiered on in Libya and Palestine
with the first battalion of my own regimen

2163
02:21:45,561 --> 02:21:50,561
for two more interesting years and
finally was demobilized in May of 1947

2164
02:21:55,140 --> 02:21:59,940
within a week of leaving the army,
I attended a job interview.

2165
02:22:02,040 --> 02:22:04,860
The managing director who saw me,

2166
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:08,370
a pale and thin lipped man was a
business acquaintance of a relative.

2167
02:22:09,990 --> 02:22:10,231
He,

2168
02:22:10,231 --> 02:22:15,231
I'd meet coldly slowly and
precisely from his desk.

2169
02:22:15,450 --> 02:22:19,500
He lifted a ruler,
which he rudely pointed at my face.

2170
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:24,160
I understand that you made a slight
name for yourself from the war.

2171
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:27,180
Be that as it may people like you.

2172
02:22:27,181 --> 02:22:31,410
Jerry should remember that while you
have been gallivanting around the world,

2173
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:34,740
most of my staff had remained
loyalty to come to the company.

2174
02:22:36,520 --> 02:22:40,210
If you can give me one valid reason
why should even consider you for any

2175
02:22:40,450 --> 02:22:42,790
position,
I should be interested to hear it.

2176
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:49,270
I nearly hit him
now.

2177
02:22:49,271 --> 02:22:52,340
I wish that I had quickly
grabbing my hat and umbrella.

2178
02:22:52,341 --> 02:22:55,330
I rose and told him that if he
was the last man in the world,

2179
02:22:55,331 --> 02:22:57,190
I would rather starve than work for him.

2180
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:03,700
With that I left my heart pounding
and a foul taste in my mouth.

2181
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:07,840
I walked aimlessly through miles of
streets wishing that I was back on some

2182
02:23:07,841 --> 02:23:09,820
battlefield with real men.

2183
02:23:11,550 --> 02:23:14,370
Soldiers like 18 platoon

2184
02:23:17,890 --> 02:23:21,280
armistice day brings its problems.

2185
02:23:22,530 --> 02:23:24,370
Peg and I would like to go to church.

2186
02:23:24,490 --> 02:23:28,420
We used to go but found almost without
exception a lack of perception and

2187
02:23:28,421 --> 02:23:30,520
sensitivity amongst the clergy.

2188
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:35,950
We suffered one armistice
day cert sermon devoted to

2189
02:23:37,690 --> 02:23:41,530
the cure rates theory that war
being a crime against humanity.

2190
02:23:42,730 --> 02:23:46,630
All Chivalry must there
for be hypocritical.

2191
02:23:48,130 --> 02:23:52,440
I wondered whether the German stretcher
bearers and they're wounded at Syndrom

2192
02:23:53,010 --> 02:23:53,860
would have agreed.

2193
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:59,680
I took offense pag and I
have a lot to mourn. She,

2194
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:03,370
Jack Weatherly and I,
18 platoons dead.

2195
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:10,130
Perhaps it is expecting too much of
anyone to understand intense grief,

2196
02:24:11,150 --> 02:24:16,150
particularly that of a now aging platoon
commander who had to lead some of his

2197
02:24:16,281 --> 02:24:18,620
men to their deaths.

2198
02:24:22,250 --> 02:24:25,430
We now spend arm assist day quietly

2199
02:24:26,460 --> 02:24:27,293
at home

2200
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:30,190
with our ghosts.

2201
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:37,530
Memories abound during the night.

2202
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:41,820
I made a habit of wandering around the
platoon positioned so that each of my

2203
02:24:41,821 --> 02:24:45,560
soldiers could talk to me.
I learned a lot.

2204
02:24:46,670 --> 02:24:49,310
They talked about their
families and their future hopes.

2205
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:55,070
I hardly had to contribute to
those whispered conversations
that some times took

2206
02:24:55,071 --> 02:24:58,820
place in the dead of night or in the
cold gray light just before dawn.

2207
02:25:01,810 --> 02:25:04,420
I think it may have helped my
soldiers to have a confidant,

2208
02:25:06,690 --> 02:25:11,520
invaluable experience of human nature.
I now treasure the memory

2209
02:25:16,110 --> 02:25:20,250
weapons. Also left
memories, the monotonous,

2210
02:25:20,251 --> 02:25:21,990
repetitive bursts of the Brin,

2211
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:27,200
the hysterical of the MG 42 for furious
rate of fire and the lethal chatter of

2212
02:25:28,811 --> 02:25:31,420
the stands and schmeissers all contribute,

2213
02:25:32,410 --> 02:25:35,620
all contributed to the cacophony of battle

2214
02:25:38,060 --> 02:25:40,700
tracer.
Bullets seared themselves into memory.

2215
02:25:41,720 --> 02:25:43,280
Fired from a distance.

2216
02:25:44,310 --> 02:25:44,720
Yeah,

2217
02:25:44,720 --> 02:25:45,900
the parrot,
the parrot.

2218
02:25:45,910 --> 02:25:50,910
Bola approached almost laser Lee until
suddenly like a swarm of fiery demons.

2219
02:25:52,970 --> 02:25:57,200
They accelerated directly past
one's head with earsplitting cracks.

2220
02:25:58,880 --> 02:26:03,050
I shall never forget the brain splitting
shockwave is mortar bombs detonated

2221
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:08,320
northern rending of the atmosphere when
a stick of Nebo War for bomb straddled

2222
02:26:09,201 --> 02:26:10,490
one slit trench,

2223
02:26:12,920 --> 02:26:15,170
my memory is stocked with smells,

2224
02:26:16,460 --> 02:26:19,220
the metallic stench of
dead cattle and Normandy.

2225
02:26:19,370 --> 02:26:24,370
The pungent odor of German prisoners
and the vial penetrating chemical smell

2226
02:26:24,470 --> 02:26:26,510
from a newly proud shell crater.

2227
02:26:30,320 --> 02:26:32,750
Strange fleeting memories too.

2228
02:26:33,840 --> 02:26:34,673
Okay.

2229
02:26:34,720 --> 02:26:39,720
Why in circumstance of great danger did
the palms of my hands moistened making

2230
02:26:40,421 --> 02:26:42,790
it difficult to grip
the butt of my pistol.

2231
02:26:44,490 --> 02:26:47,460
Why on Pitch Black Knights full of menace?

2232
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:51,840
Was it possible to discern enemy movement
by fixing my straining eyes slightly

2233
02:26:51,841 --> 02:26:55,500
to its side? It sounds foolish,
but I swear that it works.

2234
02:26:57,140 --> 02:26:58,370
After 40 years,

2235
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:02,600
I am sure I could still prime a 36
grenade in total darkness or load the

2236
02:27:02,601 --> 02:27:04,730
magazines of a cult automatic pistol.

2237
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:11,210
I remember our dead

2238
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:14,503
okay.

2239
02:27:14,550 --> 02:27:16,050
Their souls departing,

2240
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:19,620
they lay awkwardly like
bundles of discarded clothing.

2241
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:21,220
Okay.

2242
02:27:21,220 --> 02:27:25,630
At bed. Berg, lance corporal Porteous
laid by their railway crossing

2243
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:32,110
in an instant. He had gone leaving
his body clothing and equipment

2244
02:27:33,610 --> 02:27:34,443
empty

2245
02:27:36,810 --> 02:27:37,860
at Helvin.
Boom,

2246
02:27:38,610 --> 02:27:42,660
private Jones died with a tiny cry Boston,

2247
02:27:42,661 --> 02:27:46,320
the chill winter air as the
bullet took him from us.

2248
02:27:52,210 --> 02:27:53,920
Memories are not all sad.

2249
02:27:55,950 --> 02:28:00,360
Rarely since as my adrenaline
flowed as an invents to combat

2250
02:28:02,140 --> 02:28:05,410
with all the senses.
Alert one lived for a few hours,

2251
02:28:05,500 --> 02:28:08,590
sometimes for day at a concert pitch

2252
02:28:10,660 --> 02:28:13,360
like a drug. It captivated
me. I wanted more

2253
02:28:14,860 --> 02:28:19,420
totally absorbed, one pressed on
until objectives had been seized

2254
02:28:21,390 --> 02:28:23,770
and I flopped as I had never done since.

2255
02:28:26,860 --> 02:28:30,910
I remember the mood of
pulsating expectancy during
the last few hours before

2256
02:28:30,911 --> 02:28:31,660
battle.

2257
02:28:31,660 --> 02:28:36,370
Old trusted friends like Dennis Clark
and Brantley Hancock would arrive to tie

2258
02:28:36,371 --> 02:28:37,660
up their artillery support.

2259
02:28:38,380 --> 02:28:42,850
Others troop commanders from the Sherwood
Rangers would appear almost in party

2260
02:28:42,851 --> 02:28:44,230
mood to marry up with us.

2261
02:28:45,510 --> 02:28:50,270
Very air was a vibrant with excitement
and good fellowship, no acrimony,

2262
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:53,630
simply an exercise and willing
cooperation to help us.

2263
02:28:53,810 --> 02:28:56,960
The infantry overcome the days grim task.

2264
02:29:02,330 --> 02:29:07,330
But my most treasured memory is the
simple and sincere affection which existed

2265
02:29:09,480 --> 02:29:10,710
between us all

2266
02:29:13,720 --> 02:29:15,280
based on mutual trust.

2267
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:19,780
It was the cornerstone of the platoons
success and it survives unchanged.

2268
02:29:19,781 --> 02:29:20,614
To this day.

2269
02:29:23,440 --> 02:29:27,610
This is tinge to with regret,
regret because Jim Kingston,

2270
02:29:27,740 --> 02:29:30,640
Owen Cheeseman,
and particularly Doug proctor,

2271
02:29:30,730 --> 02:29:34,120
did not receive any recognition
they so richly deserved.

2272
02:29:36,030 --> 02:29:40,860
Jim and Owen were mentioned in dispatches,
but Doug was left on rewarded.

2273
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:45,400
Over the years.
This omission has troubled me,

2274
02:29:45,401 --> 02:29:49,540
particularly because I had not
been so had I not been so young and

2275
02:29:49,541 --> 02:29:54,190
inexperienced, more notice might have
been taken of my representations.

2276
02:29:56,010 --> 02:30:00,180
I have no doubt that they all learned a
military metal on more than one occasion

2277
02:30:00,330 --> 02:30:04,650
and I, their platoon commander
failed them. In this respect,

2278
02:30:09,300 --> 02:30:10,740
I miss my soldiers.

2279
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:16,860
The warmth of their presence comforted
me and their humor restored my spirits

2280
02:30:19,460 --> 02:30:21,920
in the brutal world.
If infantry warfare,

2281
02:30:22,100 --> 02:30:26,420
although few of them realized it
and certainly none would admit it,

2282
02:30:28,330 --> 02:30:29,740
their behavior was noble.

2283
02:30:32,630 --> 02:30:35,390
Their absence left a void,
which,

2284
02:30:35,480 --> 02:30:40,460
but for an exceptionally happy marriage
would have certainly drawn me back into

2285
02:30:40,461 --> 02:30:42,560
the army for the comfort

2286
02:30:44,110 --> 02:30:46,000
that only a soldier can understand.

2287
02:30:49,600 --> 02:30:54,190
Strangely, I have never since
considered myself anything but

2288
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:57,833
a soldier.

2289
02:31:10,030 --> 02:31:10,863
And that

2290
02:31:13,370 --> 02:31:16,610
wraps up that book.

2291
02:31:23,170 --> 02:31:24,040
And I'm not

2292
02:31:26,210 --> 02:31:28,670
sure if I have much to add because,

2293
02:31:37,530 --> 02:31:40,860
because Sydney Jerry seems to capture it.

2294
02:31:44,840 --> 02:31:46,950
And so much of what he talks about

2295
02:31:49,450 --> 02:31:52,960
explains
so much,

2296
02:31:52,961 --> 02:31:56,740
not only about about being a soldier,

2297
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:01,140
but also about what it's like

2298
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:06,690
when a soldier is no longer a soldier

2299
02:32:09,740 --> 02:32:14,570
to,
to miss the adrenaline,

2300
02:32:17,030 --> 02:32:19,910
to miss that singular focus,

2301
02:32:24,920 --> 02:32:29,480
to
miss seeing men

2302
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:34,910
at their best,
at their noblest,

2303
02:32:40,830 --> 02:32:43,980
to miss the men themselves,

2304
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,100
your comrades,

2305
02:32:50,910 --> 02:32:53,040
your friends,
your brothers

2306
02:32:54,990 --> 02:32:59,990
to miss what he calls so perfectly that
simple and sincere affection that exists

2307
02:33:04,680 --> 02:33:05,610
in a platoon

2308
02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:15,110
they'd affection that I'm not
sure exists anywhere else.

2309
02:33:19,230 --> 02:33:22,970
And you, you hear me talk about when
I start talking about a seal platoon

2310
02:33:25,820 --> 02:33:28,490
about how that's the best
thing in the world. And Sydney,

2311
02:33:28,491 --> 02:33:30,860
Jerry captures it better than me.

2312
02:33:30,861 --> 02:33:34,910
You miss the mission and you miss the men.

2313
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:43,390
And of course you miss

2314
02:33:45,490 --> 02:33:46,323
the fallen

2315
02:33:52,010 --> 02:33:55,790
as the British,
call them the glorious dead

2316
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:07,170
and you wonder what would
have become with them.

2317
02:34:13,330 --> 02:34:14,740
Where would they be now?

2318
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:23,090
And do you wonder why?

2319
02:34:27,190 --> 02:34:28,023
Why them?

2320
02:34:33,130 --> 02:34:33,963
Why was it down?

2321
02:34:40,470 --> 02:34:42,360
And you know,
I talk about

2322
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:49,570
the gift, right? The
gift that they gave us,

2323
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:56,160
that the fallen if given us this gift
of freedom and this gift of life.

2324
02:34:57,491 --> 02:34:59,560
But there's,
there's more,

2325
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:05,103
there's more

2326
02:35:08,990 --> 02:35:10,220
because you see

2327
02:35:13,790 --> 02:35:14,810
the rest of us,

2328
02:35:17,780 --> 02:35:18,950
we grow old

2329
02:35:23,940 --> 02:35:26,110
time passes us by.

2330
02:35:31,170 --> 02:35:36,170
And that that's simple and sincere
affection that Sydney Jerry describes,

2331
02:35:39,780 --> 02:35:43,460
it changes
as we change.

2332
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:47,503
Yeah.

2333
02:35:47,920 --> 02:35:48,870
It ages

2334
02:35:52,730 --> 02:35:53,750
as we age,

2335
02:35:58,310 --> 02:36:00,350
but the fallen do not change

2336
02:36:04,760 --> 02:36:09,750
but fallen, do not. Age.
Time has no effect on them.

2337
02:36:10,020 --> 02:36:11,220
They remain

2338
02:36:15,510 --> 02:36:15,801
babe.

2339
02:36:15,801 --> 02:36:20,801
Remain young and bold and
brave and unconquerable.

2340
02:36:30,430 --> 02:36:32,930
It's so we remember them

2341
02:36:34,320 --> 02:36:35,153
that way

2342
02:36:37,890 --> 02:36:41,820
as they were.
And as they will always be.

2343
02:36:49,330 --> 02:36:50,180
Tara heroes.

2344
02:36:55,930 --> 02:37:00,930
Heroes who walk no more and
yet walk everywhere with us.

2345
02:37:03,010 --> 02:37:03,843
Okay.

2346
02:37:04,010 --> 02:37:08,120
Who smile no more.
And yet they never stopped smiling

2347
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:16,170
heroes who lived no more yet never stop

2348
02:37:16,170 --> 02:37:17,003
living

2349
02:37:26,260 --> 02:37:27,160
car.
Friends

2350
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:31,660
who shine no more

2351
02:37:34,370 --> 02:37:36,050
and yet never stopped shining.

2352
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:47,830
And that is the other
gift that they give us.

2353
02:37:54,440 --> 02:37:55,273
The fortunate

2354
02:37:58,550 --> 02:38:01,400
to bask in their lighting.

2355
02:38:08,730 --> 02:38:09,563
Do don't remember.

2356
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:22,433
Okay.

2357
02:38:23,070 --> 02:38:27,920
I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

2358
02:38:43,090 --> 02:38:47,030
So reco maybe a frog,

2359
02:38:51,170 --> 02:38:53,420
you can talk about something
else for a little while.

2360
02:38:56,310 --> 02:39:01,290
Yeah, I would appreciate it.
Sure. You know, apart that

2361
02:39:02,810 --> 02:39:07,650
kind of stood out and we talk about this
before where there was a part where,

2362
02:39:07,710 --> 02:39:09,330
you know the Germans,
the bandits,

2363
02:39:09,331 --> 02:39:14,070
they were attacking 150 yards
away and they just get mowed down.

2364
02:39:14,071 --> 02:39:18,780
They just keep killed and then
the red flag comes up,

2365
02:39:19,520 --> 02:39:23,220
stretchers come out, everyone sees
fire. It's kind of like, you know,

2366
02:39:23,610 --> 02:39:26,110
they're following these specific rules.
Yeah.

2367
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:31,700
And then so they collect the buddies and
they salute kind of like, okay, we're,

2368
02:39:31,790 --> 02:39:35,430
we're good. And then he
salutes back. Okay, solid.

2369
02:39:35,460 --> 02:39:38,160
No game on essentially game on now.

2370
02:39:39,930 --> 02:39:42,540
But this is like a war though.
You know, it's different.

2371
02:39:42,541 --> 02:39:45,850
I mean you kind of get that same
feeling way on a lower level obviously.

2372
02:39:45,870 --> 02:39:46,651
But like your watch,

2373
02:39:46,651 --> 02:39:51,090
like a UFC fight and then the round
ends and then the guys kind of like bump

2374
02:39:51,091 --> 02:39:54,840
glove for sure. Good round. Do you
know for sure, but two seconds ago you,

2375
02:39:54,890 --> 02:39:59,310
you guys are trying to knock the guy out.
You know, just like in this situation,

2376
02:39:59,340 --> 02:40:02,460
two seconds ago these guys were coming
to kill you and you killed them,

2377
02:40:02,461 --> 02:40:05,640
killed them,
boom.

2378
02:40:05,670 --> 02:40:07,980
It happened round over.
You know,

2379
02:40:07,981 --> 02:40:12,460
let's essentially continue
following the rules and it,

2380
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:14,070
it's weird,
it's less about

2381
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:17,970
the rules and more about like the
respect, you know, it is. And,

2382
02:40:17,971 --> 02:40:22,971
and on top of that you can pile on the
fact that when they were in Hoven Woods,

2383
02:40:24,780 --> 02:40:28,760
the Germans had booby trapped the,
the British bodies.

2384
02:40:28,761 --> 02:40:30,750
So they were just laying there.
They didn't get, they didn't get,

2385
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:35,040
they didn't get the same respect back.
But I think that's one thing that,

2386
02:40:35,210 --> 02:40:39,180
that Sydney, Jerry is very
intense on throughout the book,

2387
02:40:39,181 --> 02:40:44,181
is that regardless of how
deprived the enemy acts,

2388
02:40:45,240 --> 02:40:48,630
they are gonna take the high
road. Yeah. And you know,

2389
02:40:48,631 --> 02:40:52,770
I think that's why this book is this book.
They give this book to everyone at, uh,

2390
02:40:53,160 --> 02:40:57,740
at Sandhurst, which is the, the British
military academy that gives everyone,

2391
02:40:57,970 --> 02:40:59,730
I think that's our great reason why,

2392
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:04,940
because he sets a standard with his
troops and they hold that standard through

2393
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:08,400
regardless of the way the enemy behaves,

2394
02:41:08,401 --> 02:41:11,250
they don't lower themselves
to that behavior. You know,

2395
02:41:11,251 --> 02:41:16,251
the worst atrocity that gets committed
by his soldiers is when they spank a

2396
02:41:16,291 --> 02:41:19,860
Waffen ss guy on the
ass. You know, that's,

2397
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:25,290
that's why this book is so powerful.
And, and you know, there's a lot of,

2398
02:41:26,160 --> 02:41:28,260
the book is very, it's
very, you know, there's,

2399
02:41:28,261 --> 02:41:32,820
there's stuff in there that you
just aren't ready for. Right.

2400
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:38,060
Um, even when he was talking about the
traits that someone should have, and you,

2401
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:42,000
you know, when you start
thinking about it, he's right.

2402
02:41:43,050 --> 02:41:43,883
He's right.

2403
02:41:43,920 --> 02:41:48,720
And if you had the choice between getting
some meat head that was going to go do

2404
02:41:48,721 --> 02:41:51,330
your bidding, even though he might look
like a big beast and he's going to,

2405
02:41:51,570 --> 02:41:55,410
but then if you think about how's that
guy going to act when things get tough or

2406
02:41:55,411 --> 02:41:59,910
when things become ethically challenging,
how's that person going to act?

2407
02:42:00,540 --> 02:42:01,410
So these are

2408
02:42:03,510 --> 02:42:07,710
[inaudible] and I love
the fact also that men,

2409
02:42:07,711 --> 02:42:10,230
he's killing people. He's the, you know,

2410
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:14,310
it's easy to get caught up in the fact
that he's wearing corduroy pants and he's

2411
02:42:14,311 --> 02:42:16,020
got this, there's a part,
there's another part I didn't,

2412
02:42:16,140 --> 02:42:19,200
didn't go over in the podcast,
but there's,

2413
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:23,550
there's a group of,
of um,

2414
02:42:24,660 --> 02:42:26,440
German, there's a German, uh,

2415
02:42:26,640 --> 02:42:31,460
some kind of artillery piece and an
artillery team and they're getting the,

2416
02:42:31,560 --> 02:42:35,160
the Brits are getting their guns dialed
in to the team and they're going to

2417
02:42:35,161 --> 02:42:37,590
start killing them and
they make a run for it.

2418
02:42:38,550 --> 02:42:42,780
And they have horses and there's like
six guys and some horses towing this dis

2419
02:42:43,290 --> 02:42:46,260
artillery piece away. And
Sydney, Jerry feels happy.

2420
02:42:47,160 --> 02:42:49,890
He's happy that the especially
happy the horses, like you know,

2421
02:42:49,891 --> 02:42:54,270
he doesn't like seeing the, the,
the, the animals get killed.

2422
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:59,490
And so he's actually happy that these
guys escape. And then he just says,

2423
02:42:59,491 --> 02:42:59,970
you know,

2424
02:42:59,970 --> 02:43:03,480
well that's wrong because these guys are
gonna come back and kill my soldiers.

2425
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:05,670
So he does a,
he,

2426
02:43:05,700 --> 02:43:10,700
you can see how hard it is for someone
to be in these situations where you have

2427
02:43:13,870 --> 02:43:16,240
the good conscience,
which wants to do right thing.

2428
02:43:16,420 --> 02:43:20,840
And at the same time you got
to kill people and that's,

2429
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:23,080
that's what makes combat so hard.

2430
02:43:24,430 --> 02:43:27,520
And He'd been kind of get you thinking
back, I remember the Christmas,

2431
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:32,650
the Christmas,
Christmas where the Germans,

2432
02:43:33,700 --> 02:43:37,660
the Germans kind of in that situation
they initiated that right there.

2433
02:43:37,690 --> 02:43:41,170
They were like, cause like a mutual
initiation but yeah, yeah, yeah.

2434
02:43:41,171 --> 02:43:42,670
If you remember that particular story.

2435
02:43:42,671 --> 02:43:45,850
But I think overall it was almost
like a mutual initiation. But yes.

2436
02:43:45,851 --> 02:43:48,370
And that particular story, there was sort
of a voice that says, hey, yeah, I'll,

2437
02:43:48,371 --> 02:43:51,580
okay, I won't cheat you or
whatever. And Yeah, man.

2438
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:56,760
It's just crazy how that can
kind of emerge from these
situations where guys are

2439
02:43:57,351 --> 02:44:01,750
just straight up getting blown to pieces
on purpose, by the way. Not, you know,

2440
02:44:01,751 --> 02:44:04,420
not like some tragic accident
like this is, that's the intent.

2441
02:44:04,450 --> 02:44:05,560
That's the intention.

2442
02:44:06,810 --> 02:44:10,810
And then they want to just stop
and sing together, plays soccer,

2443
02:44:11,200 --> 02:44:12,460
and then the next day,
by the way,

2444
02:44:12,461 --> 02:44:16,630
they're going back to killing
each other on mass. Yeah. Dang.

2445
02:44:17,290 --> 02:44:21,710
Yeah. That's, that's the thing
about, you know, the Yam,

2446
02:44:21,740 --> 02:44:22,331
you know this,

2447
02:44:22,331 --> 02:44:27,280
a book like this is so revealing of human
nature because business people have to

2448
02:44:27,281 --> 02:44:30,240
do the same thing. Yeah. You know,

2449
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:34,690
if you're a business person and your
business is losing money, well guess what?

2450
02:44:34,691 --> 02:44:37,980
You might have to do cut staff.
You know, if you got to, you know,

2451
02:44:38,770 --> 02:44:42,370
let's say we're working with a small
business, you've got a small business,

2452
02:44:42,371 --> 02:44:45,290
you've got 20 people, you know
all those 20 people. Yeah.

2453
02:44:45,430 --> 02:44:48,520
It's not like a nameless person
that you're firing. Right.

2454
02:44:48,550 --> 02:44:53,350
When you let go four or
five people because you need
to save money next quarter

2455
02:44:53,351 --> 02:44:55,840
or you're going to lose your building.
Guess what?

2456
02:44:56,470 --> 02:44:58,300
You're going to know those people.
Yeah,

2457
02:44:58,330 --> 02:45:02,950
and so it's the same
dichotomy where this boss,

2458
02:45:03,010 --> 02:45:04,930
who wants to take care of
his people just like Sydney,

2459
02:45:04,931 --> 02:45:06,310
Jerry wants to take care of his men,

2460
02:45:06,940 --> 02:45:09,620
and all of a sudden the only way to
do your mission is you got to kill it.

2461
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:09,950
You've got to,

2462
02:45:09,950 --> 02:45:12,340
you're going to get some of these people
guilt or you're going to fire some of

2463
02:45:12,341 --> 02:45:14,230
these people.
Otherwise our plant shuts down.

2464
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:18,130
Otherwise we can't go forward and
everyone dies. No one has a job now.

2465
02:45:18,340 --> 02:45:21,890
So the similarities,
again, that's why it's,

2466
02:45:22,030 --> 02:45:26,740
that's why these things about war
reveal so much about human nature,

2467
02:45:26,741 --> 02:45:28,570
which is really what
this podcast is about.

2468
02:45:28,600 --> 02:45:31,720
It's about human nature and the
better you understand human nature,

2469
02:45:31,930 --> 02:45:33,610
there's two things that can happen.
Number one,

2470
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:36,130
the better you can lead other people,

2471
02:45:36,310 --> 02:45:39,010
but equally as important
if not more important,

2472
02:45:39,130 --> 02:45:42,960
is if you understand human nature,
you can understand yourself. Yeah.

2473
02:45:43,130 --> 02:45:44,920
Can understand the decisions
that you're making.

2474
02:45:44,921 --> 02:45:46,750
You can understand why
something's bothering you.

2475
02:45:46,751 --> 02:45:51,751
You can understand what you
need to conclude so that
you can move forward in the

2476
02:45:53,141 --> 02:45:57,480
best possible way. And if you don't
understand human nature, you're your,

2477
02:45:57,850 --> 02:46:00,560
I mean that, that's the
understanding yourself. Yeah.

2478
02:46:01,210 --> 02:46:06,150
And these books allows you to gather
it and Garner so much of that. Yeah.

2479
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:10,160
Especially all the
similarities. So many, all

2480
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:10,993
the time.

2481
02:46:11,300 --> 02:46:16,160
I remember in junior high,
yeah,

2482
02:46:16,161 --> 02:46:19,640
it was junior high. Oh,
maybe early high school.

2483
02:46:19,700 --> 02:46:21,590
So when are you split Pop Warner football?

2484
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:26,710
Where my best friend played for a
different team, but we're all, you know,

2485
02:46:27,210 --> 02:46:31,190
in pop Warner it's different. It's not
by school, it's by like region, you know,

2486
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:35,520
like we're not region, I guess
town live on coy and no regions go.

2487
02:46:35,521 --> 02:46:40,460
I don't think anyway, still the, you
know, my best friend at the time,

2488
02:46:40,670 --> 02:46:44,690
his name is Byron, he, uh,
who became a pilot by the way,

2489
02:46:45,500 --> 02:46:49,270
I think. Yeah. Army or
Marines, I forget. Anyway. Um,

2490
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:51,770
he played for a different team,
but we were best friends.

2491
02:46:51,771 --> 02:46:54,560
So it was kind of that thing, you know,
where you're friends with the guys,

2492
02:46:54,561 --> 02:46:55,341
but then you know,

2493
02:46:55,341 --> 02:46:57,590
you go in the battlefield and you've
gathered battling and you're back to

2494
02:46:57,591 --> 02:47:02,030
friends. It's weird. You're not killing
him though. No Way. Different. Yeah.

2495
02:47:02,960 --> 02:47:07,220
Did you ever see that in Iraq?
Like any of that? Like I dunno,

2496
02:47:07,221 --> 02:47:11,290
compassion, you know, it did. Yeah, for
sure. Even with the enemy titan, not,

2497
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:13,460
not so much with the enemy type stuff.
So what I mean,

2498
02:47:13,490 --> 02:47:17,690
but with the civilian types for
sure. I mean, I mean obviously,

2499
02:47:17,750 --> 02:47:22,110
and you'd see guys would go completely
out of their way to try and protect the

2500
02:47:22,111 --> 02:47:26,180
civilian. Uh, the enemy
over there is a lot.

2501
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:30,290
It's different. Yeah.
There's a, there's, you know,

2502
02:47:30,291 --> 02:47:34,520
here you have a uniformed soldier. Yeah.
There you don't have a uniform soldier.

2503
02:47:34,700 --> 02:47:39,450
You got somebody that's trying to sneak
around and blow you up on an IED and

2504
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:45,590
yeah, you don't see that
same level of now. I mean,

2505
02:47:45,591 --> 02:47:49,820
once you get a guy captured, that's it,
you know? Okay. We've got him captured,

2506
02:47:49,821 --> 02:47:54,500
zip them up, put them in the back of
the Humvee. I mean, that's it. Yeah. So

2507
02:47:56,060 --> 02:48:00,200
you definitely,
what what he talks about is this,

2508
02:48:00,220 --> 02:48:02,420
this mutual respect of like,
look,

2509
02:48:02,840 --> 02:48:05,360
we're sitting in a slit
trench getting mortared.

2510
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:09,410
And when I like when I meet you,
you're on the other side,

2511
02:48:09,411 --> 02:48:11,750
but I know that you'd been slipping in
the sitting in a slit trench getting

2512
02:48:11,751 --> 02:48:15,320
mortared all day. That's why we have
a mutual respect for each other. Yeah.

2513
02:48:16,280 --> 02:48:18,530
In Iraq it's asymmetrical warfare.

2514
02:48:18,620 --> 02:48:22,540
So they're not suffering the
same type of situation. Yeah.

2515
02:48:23,460 --> 02:48:25,310
And they also, you know, one thing that,

2516
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:29,930
that really throws that stuff out the
window is the way that the insurgence

2517
02:48:29,931 --> 02:48:32,170
treated the civilian
populace. You know, so,

2518
02:48:32,510 --> 02:48:37,400
so we're witnessing nonjudicial murders.

2519
02:48:37,400 --> 02:48:39,320
Like when w executions,

2520
02:48:39,380 --> 02:48:44,170
we're seeing that we're seeing civilians
getting tortured, we're seeing, you know,

2521
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:46,070
people being beheaded.

2522
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:49,400
And so when you see that you're
there trying to help these people,

2523
02:48:49,401 --> 02:48:50,720
and you start to think,
look,

2524
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:56,150
if you're another infantry men
and an opposing army, I can,

2525
02:48:56,180 --> 02:48:59,300
I can empathize with you. I can
understand what you're going through.

2526
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:04,130
But if you're, even if you're
another army, but I see you raping,

2527
02:49:04,190 --> 02:49:08,910
torturing, murdering, burning people.
I don't empathize with you anymore.

2528
02:49:09,300 --> 02:49:13,920
It doesn't work that way. So
not really. Yeah, makes sense.

2529
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:15,360
Now you wouldn't get,

2530
02:49:15,361 --> 02:49:20,070
occasionally you'd get like you could
tell that someone would be mixed up in

2531
02:49:20,071 --> 02:49:23,890
something that they shouldn't have been
mixed up in maybe a young kid, you know,

2532
02:49:23,891 --> 02:49:27,000
maybe a 17, 18 year old cause
cause some of those kids,

2533
02:49:27,210 --> 02:49:32,190
some of the insurgents were
not the [inaudible] Lee,

2534
02:49:32,490 --> 02:49:37,320
you know, pro al Qaeda. Some
of them were just, hey look,

2535
02:49:37,440 --> 02:49:41,570
I'm going to get paid 50 bucks to put an
IED in the road. My gig. Yeah. Yeah. And,

2536
02:49:41,571 --> 02:49:46,020
and if you paid me 50 bucks to go
and plant, you know, crop over there,

2537
02:49:46,021 --> 02:49:50,130
I'd just as soon do that. Yeah. So you'd
see some of that, there'd be, okay,

2538
02:49:50,131 --> 02:49:52,050
look this, this kid's just, you know,

2539
02:49:52,051 --> 02:49:56,580
he just caught up in stuff that doesn't
understand. And then again, I mean,

2540
02:49:56,610 --> 02:49:57,550
all I think again,

2541
02:49:57,640 --> 02:50:00,870
the dichotomy is if you're putting an
IUD in the road to kill Americans, bro,

2542
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:04,170
I don't care about you. I
want to kill you. Yeah. Um,

2543
02:50:05,160 --> 02:50:07,470
that's all there is to that.
And

2544
02:50:09,360 --> 02:50:11,830
it's definitely a different
scenario when the,

2545
02:50:11,910 --> 02:50:13,470
when the people that you're fighting or

2546
02:50:15,160 --> 02:50:17,200
are the ones that are committing
these kinds of atrocities.

2547
02:50:17,201 --> 02:50:19,270
Cause even as these guys,
you know, they, they,

2548
02:50:19,280 --> 02:50:23,470
you'd see how you differentiate between
like the Waffen ss and like a normal

2549
02:50:23,500 --> 02:50:27,670
infantry group. He differentiates
those two. Yeah. That'd be like if,

2550
02:50:27,730 --> 02:50:29,890
let's say the war in Iraq was against,

2551
02:50:30,460 --> 02:50:34,720
let's say al Qaeda had taken over Iraq
and you were fighting give a hardened al

2552
02:50:34,720 --> 02:50:38,710
Qaeda guys or some normal, you know,
infantry men for the Iraqi army. Yeah.

2553
02:50:38,950 --> 02:50:42,420
Those guys, you would have been like, hey
look, this dude surrendered. Okay. Yeah.

2554
02:50:42,710 --> 02:50:45,190
The Al Qaeda guys, first of all,
they're probably not going to surrender.

2555
02:50:45,850 --> 02:50:50,350
And if they do, that's they're going
to knock at the same treatment that a,

2556
02:50:50,770 --> 02:50:53,890
that a guy that's a victim
of circumstance, right.

2557
02:50:54,210 --> 02:50:59,140
Lot of the Germans are a
victim of circumstance. Hey,
this guy came into power.

2558
02:50:59,141 --> 02:51:01,570
I was a soldier. I'm
still a soldier, you know,

2559
02:51:02,020 --> 02:51:05,250
and Ah man,

2560
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:07,420
just heavy it is.

2561
02:51:08,590 --> 02:51:12,370
But there is a definitely a
mutual respect that you have for,

2562
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:16,270
for another servicemen that's,
you know,

2563
02:51:16,271 --> 02:51:20,200
has been through the same kind of crap
that you've been through. Yeah, yeah man,

2564
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:21,233
it makes sense.

2565
02:51:22,060 --> 02:51:26,960
So with that speaking a
heavy lifting kettle bells

2566
02:51:29,260 --> 02:51:33,220
anyway, I feel like we should talk about
on it on a Greek kettle bells again,

2567
02:51:33,250 --> 02:51:36,760
I do feel spoiled even every time I
pick them up, even though they're dope.

2568
02:51:36,790 --> 02:51:38,920
You know the,
the artistic ones,

2569
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:43,610
should we call them artistic cause they
have names, right? Primal bells. Yeah.

2570
02:51:43,670 --> 02:51:46,300
Just call him that legend bells.

2571
02:51:47,370 --> 02:51:47,990
Yeah.

2572
02:51:47,990 --> 02:51:49,220
All that stuff.
You know,

2573
02:51:49,221 --> 02:51:52,280
I feel kind of spoiled because they're
kind of like the designer once their

2574
02:51:52,281 --> 02:51:56,990
designer ish balanced by the way you,
the way I got into that.

2575
02:51:57,040 --> 02:52:00,740
Um,
here's the thing about the car,

2576
02:52:00,741 --> 02:52:02,190
and I said this before,

2577
02:52:03,210 --> 02:52:07,810
starting light with kettle bells critical.
My friend Anthony came over,

2578
02:52:07,811 --> 02:52:12,811
I don't know if you remember Anthony
was there the first day we recorded,

2579
02:52:12,851 --> 02:52:16,790
he was at my house. Oh yeah. So he came
over the other day and he was like, yeah,

2580
02:52:16,791 --> 02:52:19,240
yeah, let's lift. And you
know, last time I seen him,

2581
02:52:19,241 --> 02:52:21,250
I wasn't so much into the kettle
bells. So I was like, all right,

2582
02:52:21,251 --> 02:52:24,010
we're doing this thing. Be
careful. And I saw him and he had,

2583
02:52:24,011 --> 02:52:27,960
I don't think he'd ever
done it. No, but he just,

2584
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:31,000
he grabbed the latest one and you know,
I said start light or whatever.

2585
02:52:31,001 --> 02:52:35,050
And you could tell his,
I'm gonna say this with all due respect,

2586
02:52:35,170 --> 02:52:37,720
if you haven't done it before,
it makes sense.

2587
02:52:37,721 --> 02:52:40,910
But like his form was way off and I'm
thinking, Bro, you're going to get hard.

2588
02:52:41,360 --> 02:52:42,850
Okay. Careful. Yeah.

2589
02:52:43,510 --> 02:52:46,540
So I wasn't going to go into
like what crazy workout I did,

2590
02:52:46,541 --> 02:52:50,920
but I'll save that for another time
for three hours right now or no,

2591
02:52:51,250 --> 02:52:55,270
I just looked at my watch to
53 that's not a good sign.

2592
02:52:55,840 --> 02:52:59,410
So I apologize to everyone in the
world for doing a three and a half hour

2593
02:52:59,411 --> 02:53:03,250
podcast, which isn't going to turn into a
faculty, describes his last 14 workouts,

2594
02:53:04,580 --> 02:53:07,270
four and a half hours.
Great detail nonetheless.

2595
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:11,920
So we'll credit krill oil real quick.
I was talking to somebody at the muster,

2596
02:53:12,550 --> 02:53:15,280
I think it was,
I forget who it was,

2597
02:53:15,520 --> 02:53:17,830
nonetheless was talking
about the benefits yet again,

2598
02:53:17,831 --> 02:53:19,840
this is like a common thing.
It's true.

2599
02:53:20,710 --> 02:53:23,230
I don't exaggerate about the
Krill oil is still kind of like,

2600
02:53:23,260 --> 02:53:27,040
I can't go back to not taking krill oil.
Krill oil and I don't mind.

2601
02:53:27,460 --> 02:53:32,040
Oh actually we were talking to life.
Remember he ran out of crow? Yeah,

2602
02:53:32,050 --> 02:53:36,350
and he's all mad at me because he gave
me some, I didn't bring any. Yeah,

2603
02:53:36,440 --> 02:53:39,710
actually technically, technically it
was Jenna Lee who brought me some.

2604
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:43,260
I think I just gave the order
nonetheless. He gave me. Yeah,

2605
02:53:43,350 --> 02:53:46,870
so I guess he and I had a part of it.
Got The credit. He'll nonetheless,

2606
02:53:46,930 --> 02:53:51,900
I'll never go back to no krill oil. So
where would you get it on it? Krill oil.

2607
02:53:51,910 --> 02:53:53,020
What if you wanted to save money?

2608
02:53:54,170 --> 02:53:58,660
Go on it.com/chocolate there's a lot
of things on there and on it is one of

2609
02:53:58,661 --> 02:54:03,490
those good companies slash
website where anything you need,

2610
02:54:03,560 --> 02:54:07,360
like anything you need supplementation
with all the way down to workouts.

2611
02:54:08,620 --> 02:54:09,550
They got it on there.

2612
02:54:10,540 --> 02:54:14,110
Try your best not to get too addicted
to the website because it's very vast.

2613
02:54:14,111 --> 02:54:16,480
Very rare. The only person that
has that issue, I don't think so.

2614
02:54:16,600 --> 02:54:21,600
I will guaranteed spend time like
watching the videos and stuff,

2615
02:54:22,390 --> 02:54:27,350
browsing the products. Sometimes you
can get like we talked about the,

2616
02:54:27,351 --> 02:54:29,320
you know how you get on
Amazon and you're like, yeah,

2617
02:54:29,321 --> 02:54:32,650
I want to get that thing too. You don't
really need, it just looks super cool.

2618
02:54:32,710 --> 02:54:36,490
It's one of those websites was on does
that? Yeah. So be careful. It does,

2619
02:54:36,491 --> 02:54:38,590
but I don't think it had like prompts you.

2620
02:54:38,591 --> 02:54:42,190
It's just the list of stuff is all cool.
You know, it's not just a kettle bell,

2621
02:54:42,250 --> 02:54:44,700
it's the really cool
one, you know? So it's,

2622
02:54:44,820 --> 02:54:48,820
it's that situation anyway on
it.com/chocolate if you want the 10% off.

2623
02:54:49,180 --> 02:54:50,950
And um, yeah, report back.

2624
02:54:51,160 --> 02:54:55,060
Tell me what you think and if you asked
me about the Krill oil, I'll tell you,

2625
02:54:55,210 --> 02:54:56,290
I'll tell you till the end of time.

2626
02:54:56,800 --> 02:55:01,690
I will not not take krill oil ever again.
If I have anything to say about it.

2627
02:55:02,290 --> 02:55:07,290
Another way to support is when you pick
up your copy of 18 platoon or whichever

2628
02:55:08,601 --> 02:55:13,120
books you choose that Jocko
reads on this podcast.

2629
02:55:13,121 --> 02:55:13,911
Go on our website,
Jocko,

2630
02:55:13,911 --> 02:55:18,200
podcast.com go to the book section
on the top says books from episodes.

2631
02:55:18,470 --> 02:55:22,880
Click through their heads up. If you're
looking to get 18 platoon the book,

2632

it on Amazon used. Yeah.

2633
02:55:27,230 --> 02:55:31,910
For like 40 bucks and used copy,
which they'll all be gone. Yeah,

2634
02:55:31,911 --> 02:55:34,580
yeah. By the time chilling,
whoever you are listening to this,

2635
02:55:35,060 --> 02:55:39,380
you can also get it from a website rifles,

2636
02:55:39,381 --> 02:55:44,330
direct.com which actually supports
the rifles regiment in the UK.

2637
02:55:44,360 --> 02:55:46,940
So, um, you can get it there as well.

2638
02:55:47,720 --> 02:55:52,720
Or you can buy the used to hardcover
copies from amazon.com after you click

2639
02:55:53,991 --> 02:55:57,140
through, click through
there, boom. And you know,

2640
02:55:57,530 --> 02:55:59,960
even if you're a buying something else,
hey,

2641
02:55:59,961 --> 02:56:04,130
click through support the cause anyway.
Another way,

2642
02:56:05,270 --> 02:56:09,860
subscribe to the podcast on
Itunes, stitcher, Google play, and

2643
02:56:11,780 --> 02:56:16,780
any other podcasts providing platforms
also and not excluding youtube.

2644
02:56:18,930 --> 02:56:23,840
Youtube is a good one video version. I
got youtube red by the way. Hey, wait,

2645
02:56:23,841 --> 02:56:25,010
wait.
What's the benefits again of the,

2646
02:56:25,011 --> 02:56:28,050
one of the benefits is on youtube
rep you can listen to you.

2647
02:56:28,130 --> 02:56:32,600
Even if you go to another APP,
it's still playing. So it's a real,

2648
02:56:32,690 --> 02:56:34,370
it's a real cool deal for me.

2649
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:39,500
I'm in sounds [inaudible] I liked to add.
I know you do.

2650
02:56:39,540 --> 02:56:44,060
That's relevant most of the time unless
you see the same ad over and over and

2651
02:56:44,061 --> 02:56:47,420
again, you don't have to, you know when
they play, you ever see the same oil,

2652
02:56:47,421 --> 02:56:49,130
you don't see ads anymore.
No.

2653
02:56:49,150 --> 02:56:54,150
But there's who may or may not enjoy ads
and or still have the older person that

2654
02:56:54,741 --> 02:56:57,210
enjoys ads. You guys, she must, you know,

2655
02:56:57,240 --> 02:56:59,810
you know how it like here for example,

2656
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:03,110
so ty Lopez,
right?

2657
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:07,370
He'll have like ad every single time.

2658
02:57:07,400 --> 02:57:10,520
I know you know that there's this other
financial company, which is a weird one,

2659
02:57:10,521 --> 02:57:14,000
which is really, it's a really
poorly done nonetheless. So ty Lopez,

2660
02:57:14,030 --> 02:57:15,980
he was the example. Ty
Lopez, he'll be like,

2661
02:57:16,280 --> 02:57:20,210
he'll talk about some stuff and then
after it's the same ad over and over and

2662
02:57:20,211 --> 02:57:22,580
after awhile you're like,
okay, okay, skip the ad.

2663
02:57:22,581 --> 02:57:25,910
But then it kind of sticks with you
and then you're kinda like, yeah,

2664
02:57:25,911 --> 02:57:29,540
that's called advertising sucked
in. Yeah. But it's kind of like,

2665
02:57:29,690 --> 02:57:33,440
I see what's going on yet. I still
am compelled, you know? So it's like,

2666
02:57:33,441 --> 02:57:36,590
it's kind of like, it's beneficial
almost. I'm over here not compelled,

2667
02:57:37,880 --> 02:57:40,050
compelled fill. No. Anyway,

2668
02:57:40,180 --> 02:57:44,690
I am compelled to to subscribe
to Youtube. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

2669
02:57:44,720 --> 02:57:45,370
There you go.

2670
02:57:45,370 --> 02:57:49,320
So we're trying to say you're sending
a lot of other stuff going on.

2671
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:51,920
Go on these tangents and it's relevant.

2672
02:57:52,010 --> 02:57:56,810
I feel like people can relate on some
level, sometimes. Maybe occasionally,

2673
02:57:56,930 --> 02:58:01,830
maybe weird people nonetheless.
Youtube. That's a good video version.

2674
02:58:01,831 --> 02:58:05,730
What's the, uh, what's Jocko
podcast is the channel. Yeah.

2675
02:58:05,770 --> 02:58:10,380
[inaudible] yeah, sure. It'd be cool
if you put videos on there more often.

2676
02:58:10,410 --> 02:58:14,400
I do just before I put like two or three
a week. Oh yeah. Two, three weeks now.

2677
02:58:14,430 --> 02:58:17,460
Kind of. Okay, good. I'm looking
forward to that new, whatever.

2678
02:58:17,461 --> 02:58:21,860
I pick number one on the other. What
does Monday? Yeah. Okay. That's one.

2679
02:58:22,270 --> 02:58:27,030
It's whatever it is right
now. Thursday. No worries.

2680
02:58:27,031 --> 02:58:29,940
I got you. Good. Subscribe to
that if you haven't already.

2681
02:58:30,540 --> 02:58:35,520
And you can get the video version and
excerpts which are sharable, sharable,

2682
02:58:35,521 --> 02:58:40,020
meaning they're just shorter and shorter.
So you know,

2683
02:58:40,021 --> 02:58:41,930
whoever opens it,
they ain't going to be more of a chance.

2684
02:58:41,931 --> 02:58:43,190
I'm going to listen to it when it's two,

2685
02:58:43,230 --> 02:58:47,310
three minutes long rather than two and
a half, three and a half. In this case,

2686
02:58:47,370 --> 02:58:49,770
hours long.

2687
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:53,520
That's just how fired from doing
podcasts cause they're too long.

2688
02:58:53,670 --> 02:58:57,880
Is that possible? Maybe.
Hmm. I guess how these else,

2689
02:58:58,010 --> 02:59:02,600
anything is possible, right?
That's the thing. Um, what
else? Uh, Jocko has a store,

2690
02:59:03,490 --> 02:59:07,850
it's called Jocko store
website, Jocko store.com. See?

2691
02:59:08,120 --> 02:59:09,950
Catchy, right? Easy to remember.

2692
02:59:10,630 --> 02:59:13,310
If it's a store and it's
jock was his chocolate store.

2693
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:17,120
If it's a podcast and it's [inaudible]
is Jocko podcasts, if it's, you know,

2694
02:59:17,620 --> 02:59:21,040
if it's key chains.
I was meeting some peach key chains,

2695
02:59:21,390 --> 02:59:25,930
some people talking to some people
at a group the other day. Sure.

2696
02:59:25,931 --> 02:59:29,850
We're not familiar with
me or with anything.

2697
02:59:30,150 --> 02:59:34,170
Good respect. And they, they said,

2698
02:59:34,290 --> 02:59:37,830
oh well do you, you know, one of
them said, oh he's got a podcast.

2699
02:59:37,890 --> 02:59:41,460
And then the other one said, oh, what's
the name of the podcast? And I said,

2700
02:59:41,461 --> 02:59:45,540
all the podcasts is called Jocko podcast.
And she said,

2701
02:59:45,900 --> 02:59:49,460
this one girl said, did you pay your
marketing team a lot for that day?

2702
02:59:50,990 --> 02:59:52,380
And I said yes. In fact, I did

2703
02:59:54,630 --> 02:59:59,520
exactly real original like that. Yup.
Original but hey man could be worse.

2704
03:00:00,530 --> 03:00:03,650
So back to the store,
Jocko store,

2705
03:00:03,651 --> 03:00:07,780
that is some tee shirts on there.
If you want to represent, uh,

2706
03:00:07,870 --> 03:00:12,860
you know the tee shirts carry a
message. The message has layers.

2707
03:00:12,861 --> 03:00:13,161
Actually,

2708
03:00:13,161 --> 03:00:16,520
I guess technically the shirts have
layers because the message is one of the

2709
03:00:16,521 --> 03:00:21,310
layers of it. The shirt anyway, go on
there and store.com if you like something,

2710
03:00:21,340 --> 03:00:24,580
get something that's a good way to
start wars shirts coming out this week.

2711
03:00:24,610 --> 03:00:29,110
That's my question to you. That's the
intention. I'm getting angry. Yes,

2712
03:00:29,111 --> 03:00:33,610
I understand. I understand. But no, make
me not in your business. Normal face,

2713
03:00:33,640 --> 03:00:36,280
normal face.
My face is way normal.

2714
03:00:36,340 --> 03:00:38,740
The don't make me come and get in
your business and do your job for you.

2715
03:00:39,310 --> 03:00:41,170
Because if you've ever heard
me talk on this podcast,

2716
03:00:41,171 --> 03:00:43,270
I talk about when people don't
do their job, that's awesome.

2717
03:00:43,310 --> 03:00:45,160
Cause then I can take their
job from them. Right, right.

2718
03:00:45,161 --> 03:00:47,890
You got to step down and think about
where I'm more of my mindset is.

2719
03:00:47,950 --> 03:00:50,470
And you may want to step it up
over on a year end all. Dang.

2720
03:00:50,471 --> 03:00:55,290
You're about to jump into the song. I,
yeah, yeah, yeah. None. No respect. I am.

2721
03:00:56,010 --> 03:01:00,190
I dig it and we're gonna try to get
that shirts for, you know, let's,

2722
03:01:00,191 --> 03:01:03,220
do you know why you're
saying this right now?

2723
03:01:03,221 --> 03:01:07,200
Because you can't wait for the
shirt that you designed to come up.

2724
03:01:08,710 --> 03:01:11,530
Also, I think you're, I
think you might be, um,

2725
03:01:12,450 --> 03:01:16,480
really sabotaging and
sabotaging my efforts.

2726
03:01:16,630 --> 03:01:18,600
I made the better shirt.
Uh Huh.

2727
03:01:19,150 --> 03:01:24,150
And you don't want to print it because
you're self conscious and that's not

2728
03:01:25,961 --> 03:01:26,850
going to stand well.

2729
03:01:26,890 --> 03:01:30,610
I will give you the respect because
there is in fact layers to this shirt as

2730
03:01:30,611 --> 03:01:35,390
well, so. All right. How about this? More
layers. More layers you, oh yeah, yeah.

2731
03:01:35,560 --> 03:01:40,340
You could be right. I think you might have
more layers than the standard, I guess.

2732
03:01:40,341 --> 03:01:43,020
We'll see. We're going to find out about
that one. Anyway, Jocelyn, start icon,

2733
03:01:43,100 --> 03:01:46,580
so women's stuff on there as well.
Some patches, some rash guards,

2734
03:01:46,700 --> 03:01:51,470
some cool rash guards. Yeah, indeed.
Hoodies, other stuff. Anyway,

2735
03:01:51,500 --> 03:01:53,750
go on there. Check it out. If you
want something, get something.

2736
03:01:53,840 --> 03:01:57,650
Good way to support. Also psychological
warfare. If you're having trouble,

2737
03:01:58,520 --> 03:01:59,510
if you're having trouble,

2738
03:02:01,700 --> 03:02:06,700
if you're like me and sometimes you stew
or currently having trouble with not

2739
03:02:07,161 --> 03:02:09,170
feeling like working out,
not feeling like it,

2740
03:02:09,740 --> 03:02:13,940
so you're considering skipping
the workout, waiting for tomorrow,

2741
03:02:14,120 --> 03:02:17,960
making your workout day into a rest day.
If you're having that problem,

2742
03:02:18,050 --> 03:02:22,310
this is what you do. Go psychological
warfare, search on iTunes, Google play,

2743
03:02:22,430 --> 03:02:25,430
Amazon, Amazon, all these things
anyway where you can get mp3s,

2744
03:02:25,640 --> 03:02:28,040
you search psychological warfare,
Jocko Willink,

2745
03:02:29,500 --> 03:02:33,080
and it's an album
with traffic

2746
03:02:34,840 --> 03:02:37,720
and these tracks will help you
through anything that you're feeling.

2747
03:02:37,721 --> 03:02:39,940
That weakness,
like I just mentioned,

2748
03:02:39,970 --> 03:02:43,480
whether it be waking up early or skipping
the workout or cheating on the Diet

2749
03:02:43,630 --> 03:02:46,990
and I say cheating on the Diet because
you made a promise to yourself,

2750
03:02:46,991 --> 03:02:48,520
you're not going to eat those donuts.

2751
03:02:48,790 --> 03:02:53,410
You made a promise and then now
like all of us eat the donuts. No,

2752
03:02:53,470 --> 03:02:56,580
that's not the promise you made. Just
like I can never eat a doughnut again. No,

2753
03:02:56,581 --> 03:02:59,830
sure. Exactly right. You can't,
everyone in the world will like,

2754
03:02:59,831 --> 03:03:03,400
someone will get better there with a,
with a camera and they'll get me

2755
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:11,400
and consider this like what if you knew
100% no one's watching or whatever and

2756
03:03:11,461 --> 03:03:15,640
then you're eating the doughnut. Can you
imagine the guilt? You're feeling guilt.

2757
03:03:15,930 --> 03:03:18,790
Yeah, he can't do it. You're done.
Don't, not to too much guilt,

2758
03:03:19,570 --> 03:03:21,730
but in the event of other people,

2759
03:03:21,740 --> 03:03:24,550
not you dropped with other
people feeling that weakness.

2760
03:03:25,390 --> 03:03:26,230
There's the track for that.

2761
03:03:26,231 --> 03:03:31,231
Remember back when I phone Kinda
came out and there's that thing.

2762
03:03:32,621 --> 03:03:35,110
There's an APP for that.
Remember that used to always say that,

2763
03:03:35,290 --> 03:03:37,960
oh there's an app for that. There's an
APP for that. That was like an expression.

2764
03:03:38,010 --> 03:03:42,160
See, look with this. There's a
track for that. Jimmy was saying,

2765
03:03:42,790 --> 03:03:47,320
just made that up right
now. Anyway, psychological
warfare, check it if you need,

2766
03:03:48,180 --> 03:03:51,250
if you need that, that spot
because really that's what it is.

2767
03:03:51,251 --> 03:03:54,640
It's a spot in life when you're
trying to lift heavy things.

2768
03:03:54,670 --> 03:03:58,040
It's good to have a spot if you're
lifting light or not lifting at

2769
03:03:58,040 --> 03:04:00,560
all. You didn't need a spot,
so don't even worry about that.

2770
03:04:00,561 --> 03:04:03,020
If you're not doing nothing, don't
even get this. You don't even need it.

2771
03:04:03,710 --> 03:04:07,220
If you're not doing anything in life,
don't get it. You see what I'm saying?

2772
03:04:07,670 --> 03:04:11,450
Makes Sense, right? I'm get
it. Exactly right. All right.
Like I said, 18 will tune.

2773
03:04:11,451 --> 03:04:15,500
You can get that at rifles, direct.com
from the UK. It supports that regimen,

2774
03:04:15,530 --> 03:04:19,220
which I'm all about. Also, you know,
speaking of rash guards and stuff,

2775
03:04:19,460 --> 03:04:23,990
check out origin main.com my boy up there,

2776
03:04:24,020 --> 03:04:24,890
Pete Roberts,

2777
03:04:25,010 --> 03:04:30,010
these kind of these kind of
psycho actually kind of a mad man.

2778
03:04:30,051 --> 03:04:33,200
He's all about manufacturing in America,
which I'm all about too,

2779
03:04:33,560 --> 03:04:36,800
and I'm going to go into this,
but at some point,

2780
03:04:36,801 --> 03:04:39,410
but like he wanted to make gies
here and he couldn't get the fabric,

2781
03:04:39,411 --> 03:04:43,460
so he went out and bought old abandoned
looms from abandoned factories.

2782
03:04:43,640 --> 03:04:47,900
I had hired like old timers that knew
how to work these things and refurbish

2783
03:04:47,901 --> 03:04:50,630
them and rebuilt them
and has made these looms,

2784
03:04:50,631 --> 03:04:54,980
brought them back to life so that he
can make gies and rash guards here in

2785
03:04:54,981 --> 03:04:58,130
America in Maine. And like I
said, that's kind of crazy.

2786
03:04:59,900 --> 03:05:02,120
Borderline psychopathic,

2787
03:05:02,210 --> 03:05:05,540
which I kind of like and
that's kind of why we're,

2788
03:05:05,810 --> 03:05:09,470
we're kind of working on
joining forces in some way.

2789
03:05:09,471 --> 03:05:12,290
A P origin.

2790
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:16,880
Warpath it's going down.
We're going to make something happen.

2791
03:05:17,180 --> 03:05:20,570
I'll keep everyone informed
as we finalize the plan.

2792
03:05:21,470 --> 03:05:26,470
That rash guard that you mentioned and
posted the video that was a lot nicer is

2793
03:05:28,911 --> 03:05:33,020
a lot. Oh yeah, Easter and legit. I,
when you see it, it's underplayed it.

2794
03:05:33,021 --> 03:05:35,170
You're like, yeah, well
you didn't know I made it.

2795
03:05:35,570 --> 03:05:37,840
I made it sound like just kind of cheesy.
Yeah.

2796
03:05:37,850 --> 03:05:40,520
Like you didn't realize
it was actually sad.

2797
03:05:42,950 --> 03:05:47,150
But the thing is that rash guard,
it's our, I had already sold out.

2798
03:05:47,740 --> 03:05:51,070
I know. So now he's printing a
bunch more but, but he's got,

2799
03:05:51,290 --> 03:05:54,860
he's got a weave the material.
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Or it gets,

2800
03:05:54,980 --> 03:05:58,580
he gets one of his producers here in
America. We have materials. So anyways,

2801
03:05:58,820 --> 03:06:03,140
check out that origin
main.com growing company.

2802
03:06:03,680 --> 03:06:07,200
We're getting in league
with them big time. Um,

2803
03:06:07,670 --> 03:06:11,660
also Jocko white tea on Amazon.
Here's a,

2804
03:06:11,750 --> 03:06:15,560
here's an actual, again, this
is a certified verified report.

2805
03:06:16,670 --> 03:06:19,850
I have a cat that used to catch
one or two mice per month.

2806
03:06:20,510 --> 03:06:25,340
I forgot to pick up the tea bag after I
brewed it and the cat ate the tea bag.

2807
03:06:26,180 --> 03:06:28,130
Now my cat is bringing home raccoons,

2808
03:06:28,190 --> 03:06:32,360
full grown rabbits and even the
neighbor's dog. So be careful.

2809
03:06:32,660 --> 03:06:35,840
Don't let your cat get it unless your
neighbor's dogs being annoyed. No,

2810
03:06:35,841 --> 03:06:39,530
that's Jocko white tea. You can have it
and it's not, it doesn't take the thing.

2811
03:06:39,540 --> 03:06:43,700
It doesn't taste like normal tea.
It tastes like victory. All right.

2812
03:06:44,150 --> 03:06:47,360
Way The war, your kid. Boom. Also,

2813
03:06:47,390 --> 03:06:49,250
this is a warning about
way the warrior kid.

2814
03:06:49,251 --> 03:06:51,170
When you order way of the warrior kid,

2815
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:56,250
just go ahead and also order a
pull up bar, some flashcards,

2816
03:06:56,520 --> 03:06:58,860
some healthy food, edit, Jujitsu G.

2817
03:06:58,860 --> 03:07:00,840
Cause when your kid gets
done reading this factually,

2818
03:07:01,020 --> 03:07:05,760
if they're going to want to be
stronger, better, tougher and smarter.

2819
03:07:06,240 --> 03:07:09,960
So supply them the way
they need to be supplied.

2820
03:07:10,650 --> 03:07:12,600
Quit playing around.
Get some.

2821
03:07:12,660 --> 03:07:15,900
Also the discipline equals
freedom field manual.

2822
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:22,020
There's no book like this doesn't exist.
It is not a normal book.

2823
03:07:23,970 --> 03:07:27,270
It's kind of like the podcast.
This podcast is not for everyone.

2824
03:07:28,230 --> 03:07:31,800
Not everyone wants to listen
to this podcast. That's okay.

2825
03:07:32,220 --> 03:07:33,960
I'm not making a podcast for everyone.

2826
03:07:34,620 --> 03:07:39,120
We're making a podcast for
people that like to get after it.

2827
03:07:39,780 --> 03:07:44,520
So this book is not for
people that want to read, um,

2828
03:07:44,640 --> 03:07:49,570
junk. Sure. Some people
don't get the podcast.

2829
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:51,540
Some people aren't going
to understand the book.

2830
03:07:51,541 --> 03:07:56,490
They're not gonna know where it's
coming from. That's okay. I'm not,

2831
03:07:56,670 --> 03:07:59,900
I'm not,
I'm not towing.

2832
03:07:59,940 --> 03:08:04,500
We're not toning down the podcast right
now. We're not saying, Oh, you know what?

2833
03:08:04,501 --> 03:08:08,220
I think everyone would like it more if
we did more, you know, interspersed some,

2834
03:08:08,340 --> 03:08:12,960
some jokes throughout it and maybe if
we made it 45 minutes and do the little

2835
03:08:12,961 --> 03:08:16,260
fun presentation and can I get some
backup music just to kind of have little

2836
03:08:16,261 --> 03:08:19,260
jangled to make people get in the spirit.
We're not doing that.

2837
03:08:21,180 --> 03:08:25,530
Not Happening. If you want to listen to
a little jangle or a little, you know,

2838
03:08:25,860 --> 03:08:29,910
metallic riff to get you in the zone
on the beginning of the podcast,

2839
03:08:29,970 --> 03:08:31,800
that's cool. Then if you
want that, that's awesome.

2840
03:08:31,801 --> 03:08:33,930
There's other podcasts that offer,
we don't offer it here.

2841
03:08:34,680 --> 03:08:38,700
You know what you're going to get with
the book if you're looking for, you know,

2842
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:41,880
um, 50 shades of gray and
you're not going to get that.

2843
03:08:44,010 --> 03:08:45,780
It's a,
but that's the cool thing.

2844
03:08:45,810 --> 03:08:50,490
The cool thing is that the publisher
let me do whatever I wanted to do.

2845
03:08:50,910 --> 03:08:55,910
So I did and I made the gear and to
feel you're going to feel that the,

2846
03:08:57,890 --> 03:09:02,890
that the feeling of the podcast is the
same feeling that the book gets you.

2847
03:09:05,490 --> 03:09:08,910
So it's a little heavy,

2848
03:09:10,200 --> 03:09:14,070
little dark, right? Sparse,
right? Sure. Get after it.

2849
03:09:14,130 --> 03:09:15,960
That's in there anyways.

2850
03:09:16,200 --> 03:09:21,080
Discipline equals freedom
field manual order it. It's,

2851
03:09:21,210 --> 03:09:24,810
it's not printed. I'll give you
an looming give you an example.

2852
03:09:24,960 --> 03:09:29,880
It's not printed on white paper,
so the straight up,

2853
03:09:29,881 --> 03:09:32,760
let's just go from there.
It's actually printed.

2854
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:36,360
The background is all images,

2855
03:09:38,370 --> 03:09:39,600
black and white images.

2856
03:09:39,720 --> 03:09:43,650
I know that comes as a big surprise to
everyone for sure and then put over that

2857
03:09:44,010 --> 03:09:48,310
his words. So there you go.
Little indicator as to what the,

2858
03:09:48,311 --> 03:09:51,360
the field manuals like you
can get that good preorder it.

2859
03:09:51,361 --> 03:09:54,040
Now of course extreme ownership.
It's a little book.

2860
03:09:54,041 --> 03:09:55,640
It's about leadership actually.

2861
03:09:55,990 --> 03:10:00,400
It's about combat leadership and how
you can take the combat leadership

2862
03:10:00,401 --> 03:10:03,940
principles that we learned on the
battlefield and apply them to your life.

2863
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:05,440
You can get that book too if you want it.

2864
03:10:07,450 --> 03:10:12,190
We also have echelon front consulting
me, Leif Babin, JP Denelle,

2865
03:10:12,730 --> 03:10:13,563
Dave Burke.

2866
03:10:13,960 --> 03:10:17,830
We will come and help your team align
your leadership so you can crush your

2867
03:10:17,831 --> 03:10:21,370
enemies.
You just heard Sydney Jerry saying it.

2868
03:10:21,840 --> 03:10:26,840
A leadership is the thing that makes you
overcome seemingly impossible things.

2869
03:10:28,330 --> 03:10:31,240
So if your leadership isn't squared away,
you're not going to overcome them.

2870
03:10:32,530 --> 03:10:36,820
So you need to get in the game.
You can contact us info at echelon,

2871
03:10:36,821 --> 03:10:38,560
front.com if you want that.

2872
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:40,080
Okay.

2873
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:44,370
Also the monster. We just got back
from the Austin Muster. Outstanding.

2874
03:10:44,490 --> 03:10:49,020
Outstanding. It was awesome. So many
great people in their lessons learned.

2875
03:10:49,110 --> 03:10:50,610
Knowledge spread.

2876
03:10:51,110 --> 03:10:51,943
Okay.

2877
03:10:52,940 --> 03:10:56,210
Tim Kennedy was there.
Tim Kennedy showed up. Uh,

2878
03:10:56,360 --> 03:11:01,360
and it was cool and I didn't
realize it until we were at Jujitsu.

2879
03:11:02,840 --> 03:11:04,760
And I think I came up to you
and said this during Jujitsu.

2880
03:11:04,910 --> 03:11:06,410
So the last night we have Thursday,

2881
03:11:06,470 --> 03:11:11,220
then Friday and then Friday night we go
do Jujitsu. We went to 10th planet at, uh,

2882
03:11:11,290 --> 03:11:15,590
Austin, Austin, 10th planet Jiu
Jitsu with my boy Curtis Curtis.

2883
03:11:15,860 --> 03:11:20,210
Todd White was there and
Todd White, right? Yeah.

2884
03:11:20,211 --> 03:11:24,830
He's an old school. Like he's, me
and him are from that same era. Yeah.

2885
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:29,630
We're, we're from the same era. From
back in the day only. He's only,

2886
03:11:29,631 --> 03:11:34,110
he's a better artist. A better
artist than me. Yep. So well,

2887
03:11:34,230 --> 03:11:36,830
we went in and what I realized is this,

2888
03:11:38,180 --> 03:11:41,930
you don't like a way the
warrior kid, people say, aw man,

2889
03:11:41,931 --> 03:11:45,530
I wish I had that book when I was a kid.
Yeah. And extreme ownership. People say,

2890
03:11:45,770 --> 03:11:49,100
aw man, I wish I had that. I wish I
had that book when I started out in my,

2891
03:11:49,310 --> 03:11:51,950
you know what I got
promoted five years ago.

2892
03:11:52,130 --> 03:11:54,140
And you know what I say
about way the warrior kid.

2893
03:11:54,380 --> 03:11:57,620
I wish I had it when I was a kid. You
know what I say about extreme ownership.

2894
03:11:57,800 --> 03:12:02,540
I wish I had it when I was a assistant
platoon commander. I wish I had it. Yeah,

2895
03:12:02,660 --> 03:12:03,493
I didn't have it.

2896
03:12:04,070 --> 03:12:08,480
And what's cool about the monster is so
that feeling when you go to the monster

2897
03:12:08,481 --> 03:12:12,420
you're giving dislike or just given
this massive amount of inflammation,

2898
03:12:13,070 --> 03:12:17,510
pragmatic information that you can
take and you can execute with. Yeah.

2899
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:22,010
And so when we were at
Jujitsu, I realized, man,

2900
03:12:22,011 --> 03:12:23,250
we just all this stuff,

2901
03:12:23,270 --> 03:12:27,130
these people in this room just
got all this information and it,

2902
03:12:27,230 --> 03:12:30,410
and it's so practical that you
can take back to your team.

2903
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:35,330
And then on top of all that,
here's a little something
else. Jujitsu. Yeah. Because,

2904
03:12:35,930 --> 03:12:40,250
um, well only one quarter of the people
that came to Jujitsu had ever trained

2905
03:12:40,260 --> 03:12:42,020
Jujitsu before the other,

2906
03:12:42,200 --> 03:12:45,680
what was 50 people that
had never trained before.

2907
03:12:46,130 --> 03:12:51,050
So they're getting this gift, the
gift of Jujitsu in true. Yeah. Little.

2908
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:55,200
And they all, I would say 50% of them
will go back and start training. Yeah.

2909
03:12:55,350 --> 03:13:00,250
Maybe more. I wish it was
100% yeah, it might be. It
might be. Yeah, it'd be, yeah.

2910
03:13:00,260 --> 03:13:02,810
It depends on what you're
into your, yeah, it's hard.

2911
03:13:03,200 --> 03:13:06,590
It was always bizarre to me that when
I introduced to someone as a Jujitsu,

2912
03:13:06,800 --> 03:13:10,880
it was a 100% conversion rate.
It should be a 100% conversion rate.

2913
03:13:11,370 --> 03:13:14,270
100% Oh, you just choked
me and I couldn't stop you.

2914
03:13:14,360 --> 03:13:18,110
I need to learn that a hundred percent
otherwise I go through life vulnerable to

2915
03:13:18,111 --> 03:13:21,400
being choked by anyone. I don't
like that feeling. Yeah. No,

2916
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:24,590
I don't like that the
muster two is sprinkled in.

2917
03:13:24,591 --> 03:13:28,550
I don't and I mean heart sprinkled hard
by the way, which is a very critical,

2918
03:13:28,551 --> 03:13:32,330
compelling part in my opinion
is this the social stuff.

2919
03:13:32,360 --> 03:13:34,790
And I don't mean social like you're
just cruising and not learning.

2920
03:13:34,850 --> 03:13:37,460
I mean the people you meet.
Oh yeah.

2921
03:13:37,461 --> 03:13:41,270
Well you definitely are going to meet
good people there because everyone there

2922
03:13:41,271 --> 03:13:44,110
is in the game big time and
they're all looking to get better.

2923
03:13:44,160 --> 03:13:47,540
They're all invested to get better.
And, and the other thing is,

2924
03:13:48,770 --> 03:13:53,750
you know we're hanging out. I ha I see all
the time. Yeah, no there's me. Lafe Dave,

2925
03:13:53,751 --> 03:13:57,470
Jp Echo. We're not, there's no
green room. It doesn't exist.

2926
03:13:58,010 --> 03:14:01,320
We don't even take breaks.
Just like when,

2927
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:06,330
when we take a break to let the audience
like go to the restroom or grab a,

2928
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:11,330
you know a cup of coffee
or Jocko white tea. We,

2929
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:14,580
we just, we just stand there like
we stepped down office agent,

2930
03:14:14,600 --> 03:14:16,490
we get everyone lines up
when we talk questions.

2931
03:14:16,491 --> 03:14:18,380
And you know what I was doing
this time was I was like,

2932
03:14:18,680 --> 03:14:22,400
instead of answering one person's
question, just to that person I was going,

2933
03:14:22,401 --> 03:14:23,090
hey everyone career,

2934
03:14:23,090 --> 03:14:26,460
cause he's asking a question that everyone
coming over a nearby, there's, there's,

2935
03:14:26,620 --> 03:14:31,190
there's 12 people standing in line. Yeah.
Instead of answering this one question,

2936
03:14:31,191 --> 03:14:32,230
this one guy whispering,
know,

2937
03:14:32,231 --> 03:14:36,650
hey everyone come up here and you
can all hear this because who knows,

2938
03:14:36,710 --> 03:14:37,700
maybe there's some of those questions.

2939
03:14:37,701 --> 03:14:39,710
Maybe it's something we're gonna
experience in the future. I don't know.

2940
03:14:40,070 --> 03:14:43,610
But you might as well listen and maybe
you have a better solution than I have.

2941
03:14:43,730 --> 03:14:48,070
Yeah. So it's like a, like a little
little brainstorm brainstorm, right? Yeah.

2942
03:14:48,610 --> 03:14:52,100
Yeah. It's cool. That's true.
You, we take breaks. Everyone.

2943
03:14:52,340 --> 03:14:55,250
There's break throughout the
known you take bricks, Jacqueline,

2944
03:14:55,670 --> 03:14:59,500
don't take breaks for us. Break
time is talk ties, talk to you guys,

2945
03:15:01,670 --> 03:15:05,960
sign a book, whatever. No
Green Room, no green room.

2946
03:15:06,080 --> 03:15:09,260
So that's the muster. Um, and by the way,

2947
03:15:09,710 --> 03:15:14,210
they've sold out all of them that
we've done have been sold out.

2948
03:15:14,450 --> 03:15:18,080
Now the next one that we got coming up
is September 14th and 15th back at the

2949
03:15:18,080 --> 03:15:19,850
Omni Hotel in downtown San Diego,
California.

2950
03:15:20,030 --> 03:15:23,930
Muster zero zero four it's gonna sell out.
This is a known fact,

2951
03:15:24,170 --> 03:15:27,470
so if you want to come,
it's September 14th and 15th.

2952
03:15:27,560 --> 03:15:31,490
That is right around the corner.
So if you want to come to that,

2953
03:15:32,570 --> 03:15:37,070
come to that extreme ownership.com is
where you can register if you want to.

2954
03:15:37,071 --> 03:15:39,380
Also my,
the way this is interesting,

2955
03:15:39,770 --> 03:15:43,670
if you train Jujitsu or if you're
interested in training, Jujitsu,

2956
03:15:45,770 --> 03:15:50,770
origin up in Maine has this
immersion camp that they do.

2957
03:15:52,500 --> 03:15:56,670
I'm going echo's going with me.
We're going up.

2958
03:15:56,671 --> 03:15:59,490
There it is.
There's two sessions that they run.

2959
03:15:59,910 --> 03:16:04,910
It's the 20th August 20 the 23rd or
August 24th through the 27th those are the

2960
03:16:05,671 --> 03:16:08,940
two different sessions or you can
come for the whole week. Anyways,

2961
03:16:09,840 --> 03:16:13,380
I'm going to be there for those middle
three days, like Tuesday, Wednesday,

2962
03:16:13,380 --> 03:16:13,381
Thursday.

2963
03:16:13,381 --> 03:16:17,340
So I'm going to be there for the last day
of the first camp and the first day of

2964
03:16:17,341 --> 03:16:20,460
the law of the second camp and
it'll be on there on the Middle Day.

2965
03:16:20,760 --> 03:16:24,600
We're going to be training, rolling,
talking, hanging out, eating lobster,

2966
03:16:24,750 --> 03:16:28,230
eating steaks, uh, just
generally getting after it.

2967
03:16:28,470 --> 03:16:32,010
So you got to origin main.com
if you want to come up.

2968
03:16:32,040 --> 03:16:36,390
There's not a lot of spaces for that.
They, it's, it's, it's not, that's like,

2969
03:16:37,560 --> 03:16:40,260
I think the most they're
going to go is 200 people.

2970
03:16:41,420 --> 03:16:44,070
So that's not a lot of spaces.
So if you want to come up,

2971
03:16:44,730 --> 03:16:48,910
register quick and I'll see you guys
up there in Maine. I'm going to,

2972
03:16:48,911 --> 03:16:52,980
what I like about it is unlike the
muster where everything is scheduled,

2973
03:16:52,981 --> 03:16:56,600
like we don't have a lot of break time
and even the break times we're working

2974
03:16:57,570 --> 03:17:01,290
this thing. I mean you can only train
Jujitsu what, six hours a day maybe.

2975
03:17:02,880 --> 03:17:05,250
You know what I mean? Two hours in
the morning, two hours at lunch,

2976
03:17:05,251 --> 03:17:08,730
two hours in the evening. So
that's six hours. You know,

2977
03:17:08,731 --> 03:17:11,760
you're going to sleep four hours.
So you still got 14 hours left in the day.

2978
03:17:11,850 --> 03:17:14,880
So what are we going to do? We're going
to kick it. Yeah. We're going to cruise.

2979
03:17:15,030 --> 03:17:17,760
There's a lake,
there's Kayaks,

2980
03:17:17,790 --> 03:17:21,770
there's a zip lines
and whatever. Yeah. Oh,

2981
03:17:21,790 --> 03:17:25,170
we'll just go lay in bed and try and
recover from the Jiu Jitsu sessions.

2982
03:17:26,070 --> 03:17:29,700
So yeah. Um, a bunch of good people
coming up renewed after that.

2983
03:17:29,730 --> 03:17:32,190
If you want to come up and hang out,
do it.

2984
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:35,130
And that will work.

2985
03:17:35,430 --> 03:17:39,420
We'll see you up there either at the
muster or we'll see you at the immersion

2986
03:17:39,421 --> 03:17:42,840
Jujitsu camp. How do you register

2987
03:17:42,900 --> 03:17:45,600

immersion thing and you'll find it.

2988
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:50,830
You Press Google, figure it out. Yeah.

2989
03:17:51,690 --> 03:17:55,650
Yeah. There's a certain element of like,
if you can't figure it out, don't bother.

2990
03:17:55,740 --> 03:17:59,580
Yeah. And there's also a certain
element of like, Hey, register now and,

2991
03:17:59,581 --> 03:18:04,110
and go to this thing today, register
today. And they always think today. Yeah,

the time this podcast comes out,

2993
03:18:07,861 --> 03:18:12,390

2996
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:23,130
If you want to roll with us virtually,

2997

2999
03:18:34,410 --> 03:18:38,670
Echo is an echo.
Charles and I am at Jocko Willink.

3000
03:18:38,671 --> 03:18:43,620
And finally thank you to everyone
for listening to this podcast and for

3001
03:18:43,650 --> 03:18:45,270
supporting this podcast,

3002
03:18:45,510 --> 03:18:50,510
which by the way is made possible by our
military who protects our great nation

3003
03:18:56,021 --> 03:19:00,100
from evil.
This podcast is made possible by police,

3004
03:19:00,220 --> 03:19:03,020
law enforcement, firefighters, EMT,

3005
03:19:03,160 --> 03:19:08,160
first responders that keep us
safe and orderly here at home.

3006
03:19:11,430 --> 03:19:16,430
And it's made possible by each and every
one of you out there working in the

3007
03:19:17,491 --> 03:19:22,020
economy,
making and creating and building.

3008
03:19:22,140 --> 03:19:24,300
So don't stop doing that

3009
03:19:26,700 --> 03:19:28,220
and don't

3010
03:19:30,150 --> 03:19:35,150
ever stopped remembering
those that went before us,

3011
03:19:38,690 --> 03:19:43,690
those that still shine down on us and
remember that we are not here long,

3012
03:19:49,760 --> 03:19:50,720
then time is fleeting.

3013
03:19:53,910 --> 03:19:56,220
It is ever fleeting.

3014
03:19:56,400 --> 03:19:59,310
So you might as well make it a good,

3015
03:19:59,820 --> 03:20:04,760
hard run,
then get after it.

3016
03:20:07,260 --> 03:20:09,540
So until next time,

3017
03:20:10,290 --> 03:20:13,200
this is echo and Jocko

3018
03:20:15,130 --> 03:20:15,690
out.
