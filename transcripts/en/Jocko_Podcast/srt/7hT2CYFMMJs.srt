1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,430
So here we go.
From uncle Jake

2
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,010
when I was a kid there was a game that
we made up that we played during recess

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,760
if it was raining outside.
So recess was in the gym?

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,430
Yeah,

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,430
the game was kind of like dodge ball
except you could change sides at any time.

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,030
And we called the game bash ball

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,700
and it was a pretty fun game.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,650
So the way you'd play basketball is first
we would pick teams and then we would

9
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:38,430
put a bunch of balls on the half
court line down the middle of the gym.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
And then the two teams would go to the
walls on opposite sides of the gym with

11
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,550
the balls right there in the middle.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,640
And then when everyone was on
the walls and we were all set,

13
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,120
someone would yell go,

14
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:51,920
okay.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,120
And as soon as that yellow came,

16
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,320
we would run to the center as fast
as we could and try and grab a ball.

17
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,420
And once you had a ball in your hand,
the goal was kind of like dodge ball.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,480
The goal was to throw the ball at someone
on the other side and just like dodge

19
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,820
ball, if you hit them and they
didn't catch it, they were out

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,980
and if they caught the ball that
you threw at them, you were out.

21
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,460
And so that part was very
much like dodge ball.

22
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,300
But this is what made the game a little
bit different when it made sense,

23
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,940
when you fought it made sense you could
actually just switch to the other side

24
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,140
and play for the other team.

25
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,490
And what that meant is that eventually
there would only be two people left,

26
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,340
one on one side and one side,
one on the other side.

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,020
And when one of them hit
the other one with the ball,

28
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:44,210
the last person in the game would be the
champion. So it was a pretty good game.

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,253
It was pretty fun.

30
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,230
But I could never actually win the game.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,390
I would do okay. I was pretty good
at it, but I wouldn't ever win.

32
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,800
Yeah,

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,940
that bothered me a little bit.

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,960
I wanted to win and there was
another kid named Billy in the class.

35
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,850
Yeah.

36
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,850
And he would play the game with us and
he was a smaller kid sometimes we called

37
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:14,970
them little belly. He was very
nice. He was tough. He was small,

38
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:17,760
but he was tough and he was determined.
He was also very quiet.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,520
He didn't say much. He played, he played
the game hard, but he didn't talk much.

40
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,260
Yeah.

41
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,260
And he was probably about
the same as me at basketball.

42
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,640
He was about as good as I was
and that meant that he never,

43
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,780
he actually won the game either,
but I could tell that like me,

44
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,700
he wanted to win the game for sure.

45
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,570
Okay.

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,010
Then one day it was raining outside,

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,840
so we had recess in the gym that we were
kind of excited because that meant we

48
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:51,950
got to play basketball.

49
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,520
Yeah.

50
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,520
And it just so happened that this day
was a really good day for me and I was

51
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,970
playing very well in the first game.

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,660
I made it all the way until
I was the fourth guy left.

53
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:12,430
So I got fourth place and then in the
second game I was the fifth guy last left,

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
little bit worse, but
still fifth place, not bad.

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,410
In the third game I was the third guy
left some third place that was the best

56
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,720
I'd ever done.
And then I got knocked out.

57
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,270
But that got me close. I could almost,
I could almost taste that victory.

58
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,090
I really want it to win.

59
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,840
And then in the fourth game,
in the fourth game, Whoa,

60
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,290
something happened and it was kind of
confusing, but I'll try and explain it.

61
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,250
So I saw the best player from the other
team charging to the line with a ball in

62
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:57,130
his hand and he was going to throw his
ball at one of the best players from my

63
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:02,110
side who was also running to
throw the ball at the other guy.

64
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,750
They were both focused on each other.

65
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,670
Okay.

66
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,630
So they didn't see me and while they
were looking at each other and they were

67
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:14,050
charging towards the line to throw
the ball, they're balls at each other.

68
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,170
I came running in from the side and as
the other guy on the other side through

69
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,380
the ball at our best player, I threw
the ball at that guy and I nailed him.

70
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,543
I nailed it

71
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,490
and it felt good because if I could
get that good player on the game,

72
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:33,690
there's a better chance I could win.

73
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,890
But he was a really competitive
player and when I hit him,

74
00:04:37,891 --> 00:04:42,891
he screamed really loud because he was
mad that he got hit and when he screamed,

75
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,390
everyone in the whole,
Jim looked at him.

76
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,280
Every one except little Billy.

77
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,280
Yeah,

78
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,040
little Billy.
That quiet kid that I talked about,

79
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,000
little Billy pulled a very sneaky move.
You see,

80
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,090
while I was distracted and focused on
throwing my balk at that other kid,

81
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:12,230
Billy snuck in out of nowhere and hit me,

82
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:17,160
hit me right in the side.
But here's the thing,

83
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,790
because everyone was looking
at the kid that's screamed.

84
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,460
No one saw me get hit.

85
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,810
Yeah,

86
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,090
no one saw it. Well, no one.

87
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,870
But Billy and I looked around and
I saw that no one was looking.

88
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:33,070
Everyone was looking at someone else

89
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:40,150
and then I just acted like it didn't
happen. I acted like I didn't get hit.

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,730
No one really noticed. Like
I said, it's except Billy.

91
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,953
Yeah.

92
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,830
And Billy just stood there looking at me

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,900
and he actually pointed at me and I could
see he wanted to say something like,

94
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,750
Hey,
you're out or I just hit you.

95
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,390
Okay.

96
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,290
But he didn't say anything.

97
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,200
Okay.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,070
And I felt bad for a quick moment.
But you know what?

99
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,720
I really wanted to win.

100
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,840
And a few seconds later there were balls
flying around again and Billy had to

101
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:22,890
move and the game went on and kids kept
throwing balls and kids kept getting

102
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:27,750
knocked out one by one, one
after the other, including Billy.

103
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,610
And when Billy walked off the court,
he did it very slowly just looking at me.

104
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,590
And then other kids got
knocked out and I kept going.

105
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,040
Yeah.

106
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,120
And then suddenly it was just me
and one other kid on the other side.

107
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,650
It was down to the two of us to
see who would be the champion.

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,410
And we both rushed to
the line ready to throw.

109
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,070
And then I did something very smart

110
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,640
instead of focused on focusing
on hitting him with my ball.

111
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,200
When he threw his ball at me, I just
dropped my ball. I just dropped it.

112
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,630
Okay.

113
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,320
And I focused on catching the
ball he had thrown, and I did it.

114
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,450
I caught that ball that he had thrown,
and that was it.

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,340
I had one,
I was the champion,

116
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,370
and I felt awesome.

117
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,460
I raised my hands into the air and I
celebrated by victory at a bunch of kids,

118
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:39,000
came back onto the court
and they congratulated me
for being the champ and gave

119
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,410
me high fives.

120
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,273
Okay.

121
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,403
And then,

122
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:46,910
okay.
